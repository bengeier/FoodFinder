{"text":"My daughter and I were in Whitby Wednesday afternoon and decided to do sushi for lunch. So we decided on Sushi Today after checking the reviews and was recommended by my son who ate there quite often. We were seated right away and it was not busy maybe a dozen tables were occupied. We were quickly served and got our drinks right away. We placed our order and the food arrived pretty quickly compared to most sushi AYCE (all you can eat) I've been too. The sushi was alright some fell apart when picking them up. The orders kept coming and they were constantly rearranging our table as they placed our orders down. The servers were constantly removing our dishes as they were completed and to a point where our conversation was always being interrupted that we felt we were being rushed. I'm giving three stars for the food but zero for the service which was rushed and rude. The price was good but the service was bad and they rushed you to pay your bill. I'll probably never return because I've been to better sushi places around Durham region."}
{"text":"warning warning do not go to this place recently moved in to the area .and so I decide i was going to take my family for Sunday dinner we reached there at 2:30 and by 3:30 we started eating and the waiters told us it was last call. I must be honest and say the food was good but tge service is really bad. they say its all you can eat but that not true I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone . I don't think these people respect any one . there was also this creapy guy by the counter that kept staring at me without saying anything but talking in is own language to the waitresses."}
{"text":"Went here with my bf tonight. We arrived at 8:30pm and were informed when we were seated that the restaurant was closing at 9:30pm, we said that was fine. I really liked their iPad ordering system, it was very easy to use and not at all like mentioned in a previous post. We were able to submit our orders ourselves because the server logged in with his code prior to leaving it at the table. This was great for keeping track of how much and what you ordered. It even tells you what time you sent it in.  For dinner Mon-Thurs it is $20.99 per adult, which I found to be fair considering other places I've been too have been more expensive. The raw salmon seemed very fresh which we were pleased with. All the rolls tasted good, though my Philadelphia roll was kinda falling apart. We enjoyed their seafood selection and the fact they had Baked Mussels which I haven't really seen before at a sushi place.   My only complaint was that we felt kinda rushed by the waiters since we came an hour before closing, even though we said that was enough time for what we were going to order. We were told at 8:50pm that if we wanted a 2nd order to do so before 9pm, so we did. I also felt rushed because our server was literally standing a couple ft from our table just waiting to take away out plates, made me feel a tad uncomfortable and like they wanted us out asap. Oh and we were not offered a refill or top up of water even once, never asked how the food was either. When I went to pay I put my calamari back on my plate to use the debit machine, when i looked down afterward I noticed he took away my plate and the food I was still eating..  I would likely give this place another try but probably go a bit earlier. We didn't realize it closed at 9:30pm before going but now we do."}
{"text":"Great food. Perhaps not the largest selection, but the food quality was (is) excellent. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had at a sushi restaurant. Took over an hour just to get our food. When we asked where the rest of our order was, they said they were busy and to reorder it. It took almost another 40 minutes to get ice cream (that was melted). Had to ask a few times for water refills and when asked the servers for it they looked lost and would avoid our table for the rest of the time we were there. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"two stars based on price and very average food. However, the service is extremely poor. I tipped $0 tonight as it really was that bad. The waitress mentioned before actually tossed food across the table to my wife.    Will not return. BTW I did tell them on the way out how poor that service was. Not sure they understood me. There are far better places in Whitby."}
{"text":"We were a party of three people and we waited by the door for 5 mins. They were not busy and they didn't even acknowledge us.   I present them with a $3 off lunch coupon on my phone in which the waitress tells me it must be printed. No where on the coupon it says it must be printed.   The food was something I would expect from sushi mountain... Terrible. The hand rolls were packed with rice and the maki sushi were falling apart.   I asked my waitress for water three times before I got a refill.  After 15 mins she finally gets around. Do they treat all their customers like this?   I definitely would not come back to this establishment as not only the food quality but the customer service is extremely poor."}
{"text":"Overall, not impressed with this restaurant. We used to go to Go Believe sushi quite regularly, but the food has no changed. Some of the meats taste better but most tastes very bland. The miso soup was especially disappointing. The first time we went the service was okay but the last time we went, it was horrible. My husband waited 1 1/2 hours for the food he had ordered to arrive, he has severe food allergies so needs to eat specific things. We asked 6 people to get his order, they said they would and then would do nothing. The rest of us had dessert before he had even eaten his food."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and hot. You order via an online menu and they bring it out to you as ordered. Service is poor. Slow. Expect to be a while. Overall good selection of food and good value for what you pay (~$13 for an all you can eat lunch buffet, and $17 for dinner)"}
{"text":"This place used to be great when it was GoBelieve. I'd say I've been here roughly 20 times so.... Service has really gone downhill with the lone exception of 1 nice server everyone is rude. The food is terrible! Sashimi was terrible and did not taste fresh at all. Disgraceful! Everything is well below average and for us as a family of five it's very expensive for crappy food. This was actually the last chance we'd give this place and now we will never ever come back again!"}
{"text":"This used to be our go-to place not only because they are so close to home, but because it was amazing and had great service. Now that it is no longer Go Believe Sushi, it has lost something. A lot, in fact. The service is slow, the table beside us got our order be mistake, they got served before we did, even though we were there before they were and our order was submitted before theirs as well.  We wait a long time for food, they bring it all out at once, and then don't come back for a long time. They don't speak English much at all either. We waited 20 minutes for ice cream (the order was submitted on the iPad but forgotten about) and once we reminded them,  it still took another 5 minutes. We just got up and paid. Then she asked if we still wanted it while we were at the counter paying the bill.   I used to recommend them, but I don't anymore."}
{"text":"SO MAD  I ordered online a half hour before I came to pick up my 3 rolls.  When I got there the lady told me it would still be 10 minutes because they were waiting on a fish to get into the kitchen.   So I told her I didn't have time because I had an appt in 10 minutes.   I tried asking which rolls I ordered that needed that fish, and was going to just change my order to something that they could make sooner.   Instead, she cut me off as she picked up the phone ,  Then didn't put them on hold ... she just totally cut me off and ignored me and continued to help the other person.   I WALKED RIGHT OUT  ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE  THANKS A LOT"}
{"text":"Same great service and menu as with the previous owners as Go Believe. They've done some renovations by adding more booths. The addition of iPads for ordering is a welcome change. I like having a picture and description right there.  Hoping they add more to the menu as its been the same for awhile."}
{"text":"An enjoyable restaurant for all you can eat sushi. They have an Ipad ordering system of which you can select Japanese and Chinese dishes."}
{"text":"Food: average if that.  Service: not very good   I can understand the low ratings because the customer service here is poor. Don't get me wrong, we were seated and served our order in under ten minutes and the other dishes came out very fast, but it was clear that they wanted us out as fast as they were popping out dishes. They seemed so overstaffed for the wrong reasons as so many employees were wandering around and swooping onto your table every time a dish empties without saying anything. This seems like a good thing, as dishes pile up, but it was almost invasive as they slowly walk up and down the path next to your table and hang out in a group nearby talking amongst themselves while you eat. I guess I expect a little bit more than that when I eat out?  Also, the lady took away the tablet straight away after my dad ordered dessert and she didn't ask to see if we were done. She just said \"Hand me the tablet\". I felt like they were all waiting for us to get out as soon as we sat down. I understand that ayce places are FAR from the pinnacles of customer service and yes, they do want customers in and out as quickly as possible. I also understand that I am NOT entitled to smile and chit chat from their employees, but this was plain out rude. We were interrupted and rushed.  And food was just okay. Sushi rolls were good, even if a little messy. Sashimi was good and they didn't skimp on the size of the pieces like most ayce places. You can tell it isn't fresh and roe tasted off. Extremely average.  Basically, if you want to save a couple of bucks and not pay extra for a drink, and extremely average food and borderline rude service, then go here. I'll stick to the Tatemono/Makemono chain and pay the extra few dollars."}
{"text":"We just simply love the quality of the sushi & sashimi here. We've been to so many sushi establishments in Canada & Japan, but this place has the taste that we are looking for.   I would highly recommend their salmon & butter fish sashimi, & their specialty rolls: Hawaiian roll (wrapped in avocado & drizzled with mango sauce), black dragon roll (wrapped in BBQ unagi), and their spicy crab roll. Their butter fish handrolls & butter fish pizza are excellent!  Nice, bright, and clean atmosphere. Quick & efficient service. We're definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today with a friend the sushi could've been done a little bit better in terms of rolling it properly The sushi was not neatly done and some of it was falling apart but it taste OK still the only concern is that they really should use fresh avocado my dynamite sushi the avocado was pretty rotten working and I refuse to eat some of the pieces of it fortunately enough they didn't charge me for that because I showed it to the waitress and she said she won't bill for me I think this restaurant needs have A few more dessert options and put other things on a lunch menu too"}
{"text":"I've been here only a handful of times, but i must say that even though their selection isnt the best...their fish is exceptional. A little bit too much rice on some if the rolls. Sometimes its not always about the best selection when it comes to the sushi. Its all about their fish."}
{"text":"Its our 2nd time here and we like this place. The last time we came here they forgot our sashimi but its ok coz we're full anyways. We will go back here for sure."}
{"text":"Last time I was not long ago for 2 people to eat all you can eat was 27.00. Well, the exact same food is now 40.00! Totally not worth it for lunch and won't be going back"}
{"text":"The service was horrible! The manager was rude and the sushi was subpar. We honestly waited an hour for our food to get to us. This place should be called Sushi Tomorrow. Go believe was so much better."}
{"text":"This is the former Go Believe sushi restaurant now under new management with new staff and operating under the name Sushi Today. Sadly so many of the things that made Go Believe a good place to eat have been lost in the change over. Service in particular is very poor. Most of the staff have very little command of English, and so don't understand when you try to ask them a question.  They are very slow in refilling drinks, which you get through because it takes even longer to bring half your order. I waited over an hour for some fried rice and avocado pizza to be brought out.   When the food does come, it is ok, but noway near as good as under the old management. For a Sushi restaurant you'd expect them to be able to cook decent rice, but no longer can they seemingly manage that here.  They've also brought in a new gimmick of iPad menus; instead of writing on a piece of paper your order, you click on an image on the iPad. This sounds fun at first, but the layout isn't great for finding what you like, and once you've selected your order, there's no way to transmit that without a server coming up and entering a pass code. The problem being the servers are so inattentive that you wait ages for one to actually submit your order.  Based on our last few visits we are unlikely to rush back here. Before it was our go-to place."}
