{"text":"This particular branch is one of the most up scaled libraries I have seen across the nation.  Always a smile on my face when I leave.  ..so hard to leave though..free internet, park with a pond, playgrounds, swimming pools, mlb practice stadium, live music, parties, book sales....so so much to gain, just by going to the local library  Thank you SL"}
{"text":"It's more than just a library, it's a community hub that brings together every age group and walk of life to expose us to culture, activities, and education all under one roof!   The location is within bike riding distance from my home so my son meets his tutor there weekly in their bright, open workstations. My 2.5 year old and I have attended the Toddler Story Time and Toddler Songercize classes which are fun, friendly, and best of all--FREE! I have attended classes here on a range of topics and of course the library itself is fantastic. Such an enormous selection of books, movies, and so many pc's that there is simply no excuse not to come visit the library. What I like best though is the ability to download eBooks to my iPad from their website! I don't have to remember to return the books because after 14 days, the book isn't available to me anymore...and I just have to check it out again. No late fees, no guilt. Gotta love it!"}
{"text":"I like the layout of this library and I love all of the windows it really makes the whole building bright  The library just as you walk in has a big area to buy used books magazines   My kids love the kids computers"}
{"text":"I am from northern Indiana and thought we were pretty up to date technology wise, but this library system is sweet!  Totally self serve if you want!  Lots of selection and friendly staff.  Bonus is all the activities they have each month for kids and adults alike."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of libraries in my life and have never encountered a system such as theirs. The books have no numbers on the spine. What happened to the Dewey decimal system? It's like you're given a subject such as SOCSI or TECH and have to go to that section and fend for yourself. There is no numerical order. I took off another star for being kind of small and a lot of books that I'm looking for they just didn't have, so I'll have to go elsewhere. I took off another star because most of the chairs at the computers just aren't working right. Other than that it's a pretty decent library."}
{"text":"I love our local library~!   The location is within walking distance from my home so it is easily accesible for me. (Until Spring Training  that is, as the other reviewer mentioned) And I love that I can order everything I want online, get an automated phone call and then show up to pick up my selections.  It's so wonderful to go to such a peaceful place where the staff is very accomodating and pleasant. And do yourself a favor....on a sunny  (slightly breezy )day, sit by the windows, look out onto the lake and delight in the way the sunshine dances across the ripples in the water.  It's truly breathtaking. Just don't forget to enjoy the walking trail and park as well....its really a wonderful FREE family outing!"}
{"text":"Excellent library. Here its not just about books. Its a community. Activities for all ages. Story times, teen activities and more.   We have always found books we need. They have magazines, movies, computers you can use. Everyone is friendly and nice. Lovely location. Across from Spring Training, next to the park, dog park, fishing hole. Ample parking for such a busy area.   We love coming here. Books are kept in order, easy to find. Someone is always around to help you should you need help or get lost. :)"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  Left my card at home and the staff was extremely rude because of it and wouldn't issue a temporary card or simply give me my number. I was then asked to leave the teen area, where I was sitting with my teenage son, because it was for teens only.  I understand the policy but if I am with my own child and not interfering with others, then why is it an issue?"}
{"text":"If I compare this library to white tanks I say it is a three, cuz white tanks is a FIVE, but this library is good. The movies, books, clean facility, friendly librarians (except one, she doesn't seem to like her job very much), super convenient location, etc... This place has it.  We are on a very strict budget for the next few months (so my reviews will be for free things and very inexpensive restaurants :) , so it is great to get movies and TV shows for free, the online management is great (this goes for all MC libraries though...)"}
{"text":"I dunno about you, but we went to the library a lot when I was a kid. (Oh dear GOD, I just actually said \"when I was a kid\". Send me my AARP card.) I loved browsing the shelves for Harry the Dog, Curious George, Richard Scarry stuff, and later on, trying to surreptiously include a Judy Blume in between other, more 'innocent' books during checkout. There was no way my mom would have let me BUY a copy of \"Are You There God... It's Me, Margaret\", so the library was about the only way I'd get to read that forbidden fruit. Ah, Catholic school...   Yeaaaah so anyhew, now my family goes to the library every week. No joke, every week. I love being able to log into my account online from... wherever... and indulge my sudden whims by transferring a book, movie, CD, whatever piece of media, to my nearby branch and placed on loving hold in my name. My teen likes their anime selection; the little ones really like the little play area and huge selection of kids' books. Plus, they do kids' activities quite a bit.   My hubby has found really recent movie releases here, sometimes there is a wait. I think we got Order of the Phoenix about a week after the DVD came out. I was able to snag a copy of Arcade Fire's Neon Bible right when it came out, and was able to scoop up Augusten Burroughs galore shortly after Running with Scissors was released in theaters. (If you like neurotic dry humor, gotta check him out in nonfiction. I'm hooked.)   There are a ton of computers to use (never actually used one though), and the librarians are really nice. Kinda slow at times, but really really nice... and helpful. For the crap they have to put up with sometimes, gotta admire them.   All in all, it's a weekly trip we all really enjoy. The atmosphere is decent, and the bathrooms are super clean. We can pretty much get what we want, and I don't feel like I've been made to squeal like a pig, like I do when walking out of Barnes & Noble. Now if I could just get them to open a little coffee bar... :)   Minus one star for needing a bigger parking lot during turista season (yeah, like that spring training parking ain't gonna end up there... it's right across from the stadium) and having a door alarm that likes my hubby way, way too much."}
{"text":"Today I checked out the Surprise Library to get my son his first library card. He was so excited. When we walked in we went to the counter and were greeted by a very nice woman who really made him feel special. She let him take his time picking his card and even signing his name on the back. Once she explained everything we went on our adventure through the library to find his treasures. He was in awe of the kids section, and so was I. They had the perfect size chairs, computers with learning games, and tons of books by reading level. He chose two. We used the self check out which was so easy. He's only seven and he was able to figure it out all on his own. I see us visiting often and staying for activities."}
{"text":"This is a great library with many services available and lots of space to spread out.  Nice view out the windows of the lake and park, too."}
{"text":"The whole family loves this library, from the grandparents to the grandchildren.  There is just something about the atmosphere that is very special.  We go at least once a week because of the activities.  The grandchildren love the chess and the teen activities, and the adult classes are varied and fun.  Friendly, helpful staff and a wonderful setting beside a park and lake."}
