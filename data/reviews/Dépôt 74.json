{"text":"Between Bellechasse and Beaubien is my favourite part of the Plaza. Over the years some really nice spots have opened in this block and Dépot 74 fills a need which is affordable, filling food done well.  From the outside the spot looks a little timid but the inside is warm, filled with industrial décor with vintage accents. Playing is a classic/oldies station which I think is fitting and enjoyable.  Depending on the time of day it can be quiet, but it fills up around lunch time. This makes sense considering you can get a pretty hefty meal for around $10.  The majority of the items on the menu are $5 with a few more elaborate items going for a few dollars more. There are a couple of beef burgers, sausage burgers, pizzas, pastas, poutine, sandwiches going for $5 and all the salads are $5. On most of the mains you can add a side of fries for $2 or a poutine for $3.   Today they happened to be shooting photos for their website so I got to snap some photos of the food. For myself I ordered a bbq burger (with bacon and real melted cheese) - $5, plus a side of poutine - $3, and a dijon salad - $5. Grand total was $13 and I ate a hell of a lot.   The costs might be low but the presentation is still nice, the buns and garnishes are not afterthoughts. If you're looking for a quick bite on the Plaza or around Beaubien metro, I think Depot 74 is worth a visit.  There are some veggie options and the owner tells me they will be opening for brunch soon."}
{"text":"Had to check out this new resto which was once \"Faste Fou\". Look is completely different and I love it. It's just beautiful.   Any choice at$5.95  Tasty, well prepared. Honestly nothing to complain about the food.   The only critic I would have is staff. Hire the right staff and this place is a gold mine..   Will surely be back."}
