{"text":"Being a girl who loves red meat the Keg is my go to for quality and consistency. We went to have a nice celebratory dinner and all I can say is I'm very disappointed. I always get the same dish at the Keg the prime rib. I mean my grandma makes a crazy good prime rib but for eating out the keg never disappoints me with their prime rib. 

However this time I was not a fan of the meal at all. The prime rib I ordered was supposed to be a Medium it was far from that mostly over cooked. Lacked any sort of flavour and the size I asked for seemed much smaller than what I'm used to. I also ordered a skewer of jumbo prawns. I always eat my prawns first because they are my favourite and although they were cooked properly they were cold for something that was \"hot\" off the grill. I like my food hot simple as that.

The layout of the dining room is really bizarre. You are seated next to people who are practically eating their dinner with you. Not the greatest setting to have a nice meal out and conversation. I would have rather we ate our meal in the lounge which had better seating and it was actually more intimate for a conversation and meal. (Had I known this at the time of course)

The wine list is great however over priced for sure. I could bring my own bottle if I really wanted to fork out so much money for a basic generic wine. The service was really good though I always find the staff at any Keg really friendly and helpful. I'm over the Keg for the time being though. I will have to journey to new prime rib horizons."}
{"text":"horrible and unacceptable quality of food.  Was served prime rib meal that had a horrible offensive odor .  After realizing that this was actually being served and unfortunately trying a few bites , the server apologized and explained the roast was left over from the day before and would be thrown out!  I was brought a fresh prime rib but unfortunately my appetite had been ruined.  Hopefully this will not result in food poisoning. Never would have expected this quality from the Keg. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"I went to this Keg on Sept. 2014, the steak is not up to par and the service is normal, so
after I went to their sister rest. Keg at 130 Ave SE, I have not been back to this Keg.
This Management should take lessons from their other Keg if they want to upgrade themself."}
{"text":"I'm torn on this restaurant, as a former server at the Keg in Ontario, I tend to notice all the imperfections. Makes me feel like the one I worked at was extremely strict about following the rules, and this one is lacking. 
I LOVE the food at the Keg. I can eat it all day every day, the reason I am torn is because of the service, everytime I have eaten in the dining room, my service is good, however, I did notice lacking in the Keg \"talk\" they are supposed to do when you arrive.
In the bar, my service has always been dreadful.  One day we sat at a table for 10 minutes without even being noticed, by the server even which we noticed was in charge of that section. Being a former employee, I know they are supposed to have coasters over almost immediately to show that we have been greeted, and then again to take our drink order if we have not ordered yet, and drinks within 2 minutes of ordering, instead, we sat there for 10 minutes as she couldnt even look at us, when a booth opened up, we moved. This server was extremely slow, however, as it is a busy night, we were a bit forgiving. However, she took 30 minutes alone just to take our food order, and I knew what I wanted when I walked into the place. Our food took a while, however, we had a round of drinks bought for the slow night. This was a disappointing experience, on others, I have had no bread being brought, the drink made the wrong way (I know my martini), and some servers have been quite snobby at times. 
But I will always return, probably not to this location again though because we are moving, mainly because the food is delicious!
If you want some ideas:

Ahi tuna - sooo good
Baked goat cheese - the bruschetta topping was better in Ontario, perhaps the produce made the taste different
Baked garlic shrimp
Escargot
Scallops and bacon - because their cocktail sauce is to die for.

Any steak, the prime rib is excellent, watch out of the horseradish, its got alot of bite.
If you don't like steak, the thai chicken is so good

dessert - must order the billy miner pie. It is a swiss mocha ice cream cake, even when I couldn't imagine another bite of garlic mashed potatoes, I can always find room for this.

Also - order a caeser, the spicy bean is awesome, and remember you can choose a premium vodka for the same price as their bar brand which is polar ice. and ofcourse topshelf is more."}
{"text":"Good food and pleasant service. I got the prime rib and lobster tail. Don't miss the double baked potato. Good ambience. Kinda dim lighting. Wasn't noisy or at least I didn't notice."}
{"text":"What can you say about The Keg that isn't already common knowledge to most Canadians? This Keg gets four stars primarily for two things.  First, for whatever reason the prime rib at this location in particular is good...extra salty and available on the rarer side until late in the day. Maybe because they are not open for lunch? Second, the lounge downstairs has a great atmosphere and several cozy tables by a nice fireplace...it's the only place we dine if we come here, since the upstairs is just like every other Keg."}
{"text":"I confess, I have expectations when I go to the Keg. This particular location does not meet those expectations. It takes a long time to get a table here. Once you get to your table, the server will be right there to offer you a glass of wine.

We have noticed that they are a bit pushy with the wine list. You get the feeling that it is not about the wine, but adding more items to your bill. They *constantly* ask you if you want to add this or that to your order.

The food is slow to arrive. When it gets there, you get what you expect... a good steak that is well-prepared.

If you want a good steak in Calgary, there are better places that will get you seated faster, get your food to you faster and won't do a \"hard sales\" job on you to get you to add more items to your bill.

Overall: Meh."}
{"text":"Meh I've experienced better describes my family's recent trip to the Keg, unfortunately.  The food was decent and they *did* remember my son's birthday.  However, a couple of things wrecked our experience.  First, my husband commented on the shabbiness in the washrooms.  I guess there was a huge chip in the sink.  Could be easily fixed - obviously affects customer perception.  The shabbiness pervades the entire restaurant, really.  

No changes are apparent since the 1980's.  The thing that really un-sold us was the service.  When a server says they will be right back with the menu or the debit card machine, they should do exactly that.  While we waited and the kids squirmed, I was mentally reducing the tip.  Started at 20%; by the time the server arrived it was no tip.  We went because of a gift certificate, and truly, I see no reason to return."}
{"text":"I usually always have great food from the Keg, but when I went to this location in particular, I was very disappointed. They served burnt stuffed potatoes and the food just didn't taste right. This was litterally the first time I had ever seen this happen at a Keg. Looking back at other reviews, it's obviously not an isolated incident.

I'll stick to the newer locations I guess..."}
{"text":"Had a great Birthday supper!! Food and service were exceptional. Timing between apps and main course worked well for our family. Definitely be back:)"}
{"text":"for a chain restaurant concept, this place ain't too bad.

it could use some windows, though."}
{"text":"They let us make a reservation here for 4 people which was fantastic! We showed up a little late but we had no problem getting seated. The food is the same as any other keg expensive but delicious. Our waiter was great and gave our table much more bread then he was supposed to give us and we all loved it! My only downfall I didn't love the location and the parking was paid parking?! Otherwise great night/food."}
{"text":"I feel funny giving 3-Stars for a good experience.  As soon as those stars turn that dreaded tangerine orange we all freak out a little inside. But, it's still a good rating! I thought it really was A-OK! 

We were in the mood for a big slab of medium rare meat the size of a baseball with some carbs on the side, a cute male server catering to our every whim and a couple of glasses of not-over-priced wine.  (otherwise known as; \"the cost wine should be priced at\"). 

Not being a big fan of big box restaurants and preferring to eat at more locally owned restaurants we still got everything we were looking for and left happy. Service was good and we didn't leave with half our rent in the billfold. 

I don't know why we don't go to The Keg more often."}
{"text":"Excellent service but disappointing food for half of our group. New York steaks, not tender, definitely overcooked. These New York strip loin steaks were about only 3/4 inch thick or less, unlike anything we have ever seen at The Keg or other decent steakhouses. The double baked potatoes looked ancient - skin incredibly tough, almost unable to cut through the skin. In all fairness, those  that ordered filets and garlic mashed potatoes were winners, especially as far as the steaks were concerned. In hindsight, we should have sent the dinners back - but, that generally disrupts the evening for eveyone. At a place known for steaks, half of those ordered shouldn't ever be of such poor quality. Suspect that ordering \"medium or above\" means you get a skinny steak. Shouldn't be the case.Very disappointing for sure.From a price perspective, dinners definitely overpriced for the quality while wine menu prices not unreasonable, compared to many other places."}
{"text":"Always a great meal when you come here, however, Kristen in the lounge really earned her 5 stars tonight!  I recently discovered a gluten (wheat) allergy!  When I asked her if they had a gluten free menu she was very happy to show me all my options!  And yes there were quite a few (although I had to pass on my fave appie and the bread). She then informed the kitchen of my allergy and they took all the necessary precautions to make sure my food wasn't at risk!  Thank you Kristen for your excellent service tonight!"}
{"text":"I know, I know. What's a vegetarian doing reviewing The Keg?!? Hear me out. 

My boyfriend and I went to The Keg to celebrate his birthday. It's his favourite restaurant and we wanted to have a romantic dinner together. 

We were luckily seated by the fireplace which I LOVED. It was SO warm and cozy and it really set the mood for the evening. 

The Mr. ordered the Escargot to start and the Prime Rib for dinner. I had the Spinach Salad (salad is obviously the only option for vegetarians here) and we split the Brownie Sundae. 

The food was delicious. My salad was great and the Mr's meal was fantastic he said. Our server was wonderful and extremely attentive. 
The atmosphere was perfect and like I said, the fireplace was la piece de resistance. 

Although there's not a whole lot for me to eat at The Keg, you can definitely put me down as a fan."}
{"text":"Great steakhouse - I was here with a really good friend of mine for dinner. We chose a booth to chat for catching up and Originally we were placed in a really noisy area but staff were open to accommodating.  we had both steak & fish - the server  recommended the New York peppered steak & it was decent medium rare. both were good options. Especially like the Asian style bun as starch.the salad was pretty good - we had tomatoes salad. Overall, decent food, atmosphere average. For a keg, I would expect quality adjustment in terms of service. Seemed very busy -staff were nice, and perhaps staffing adjustment is appropriate."}
{"text":"Stereotypes exist for a reason.  Because they are usually true.

Step into the Keg's bar.  On one TV is the NHL finals.  The other TV is broadcasting an interview with Geddy Lee (don't worry if you can't hear it, it will replay at 11:00PM).  Waitress comes around and asks if I'd like today's special wine, a Jackson Triggs sheer-aaazzzz.  7/10 women in the place are gorgeous.  I see at least two mullets.  Everybody is nice.  What can I say but its a typical Western Canadian evening."}
{"text":"Most of the reviews mention how nice (and expensive) the restaurant is. The lounge is great. I went to The Keg based on reviews, and quickly found the downstairs lounge. 

The menu prices are more reasonable: $8-20. I had a steak sandwich that was amazing. Juicy, tender, and delicious. Their beer selection is decent. This is a great place to grab a late night meal."}
{"text":"Was told about The Keg from a guy my boyfriend and I met. He said we must try the steak so that's what we did. It was great! We also had a bunch of appetizers. The garlic cheese toast was not as good as we thought, it was super oily. The calamari wasn't so good either. But I did like the spinach salad that had strawberries in it. The french onion soup was good. And the Thai chicken was tasty with lots of flavor but there was just a bit too much of the mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"The food is good, the service is attentive, and the atmosphere average.  Had the calamari.  The sauces were top notch.  Blue cheese filet was also good as were the garlic mash.

There's going to be a theme to all of my Calgary reviews: Where is the great beer?  I immediately recognized the choices at The Keg as crafty, not craft beers.

One of the beers I was thinking about was the Aprikat.  It's a beer with apricot flavoring.  I like #9, and I figured this one might have a bit more of an apricot spike (it did, but it was nice).  The waiter came around and he said, \"The Aprikat is an IPA.\" On the menu it distinctly says it's a \"Wheat ale with apricot flavoring\".  I looked at the guy sideways and said, \"It is?\"  He said, \"Oh yes.\" I had to fight ever fiber of my being to educate this guy.  I blame Alexander Keith's for his ignorance."}
{"text":"I pop up my review a star as this experience at this particular Keg was a little different.
We came in early on a Sat evening which for us was a late lunch. If going to dinner, I recommend you go early at the Keg to get a seat. When we left around 6pm, it was crazy busy.
No hostess at the front as she was seating another couple upstairs but this time we opted to go downstairs where the sign going down reads `BAR`. 
 When you get down there, you may be surprised at how large it is, and the space keeps going until you reach the lovely fireplace! This is a sunken level and we got a great spot with only a couple of other tables taken there.
They make a really good spicy Caesar here.
I had the surf and turf off the bar menu which is a 6oz cut sirloin steak and 2 grilled shrimp with veg. (green beans and red pepper) It was good. Not excellent but good. This cut of steak was a bit tough, a little sinewy but cooked perfectly rare as requested. I loved the portion as I was able to eat all of it. At the end of my meal I was craving a twice baked potato that I usually get with the larger meals but I behaved myself, saved the calories and did not get one to go his time as I sometimes do. I just love them!
One thing is I miss the sourdough bread and wish it would come back. Why did they switch it to plain bread I wonder.. 
He got the prime rib burger. It was by far not the best burger he has ever had but it too was good. He said the patty got a bit lost in all the lettuce but he ate every bite with fries on the side which were hot, seasoned and crispy.
The best part of the meal was the service. It was worth 5 stars. As I have mentioned in previous reviews, I am not sure what it is with Calgary - if wait staff do not need the money that bad or hate their lives serving people but we are very surprised to get excellent service these days and on this date, we did.
Brittany, you are a rock star and you made us feel welcome and valued. You were efficient, polite and fun and we hope to get served by you here again!"}
{"text":"I would give this location 5 stars for service and ambiance, but the food is where I have to deduct some stars. When I order a Caesar \"not too spicy\", I shouldn't have to dilute it with water in a large wine glass when it arrives. And my Tuna Tacos were much too spicy too, and I DO like spicy things. Maybe there should be warnings on items with heat? Not everyone wants (or can tolerate) a high Scoville rating on their palate. And my daughter's \"medium rare\" steak was dry and barely chewable. Chew, chew, chew, chew, like a piece of inedible shoe leather, and the taste of that one chaw that I attempted was lacking in the usual great steak flavour that The Keg is known for. Other than that, not my first choice in dining, but certain family members are diehard Keg fans, and sometimes you just gotta go with the majority, especially when someone else is picking up the tab.
PS: Proper hair restraint should be adhered to in the kitchen and for servers; of my fellow diners pulled out a 7\" hair from the middle of her salad, AFTER having a few bites."}
{"text":"Upon entering, we were greeting by several pretty hostesses wearing short black skirts. My wife says, \"They must be shooting a Robert Palmer video.\" I don't think it's necessary to have models as hostesses. Their prices are too rich for my pocketbook and decor was dark and windowless. It felt like something from the 70's."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for five. Was seated in a booth for four?? Just stuck us in a corner due to lack of a table. 
Why make a reservation one week in advance??

This Keg location has no access for disabled persons. As well as no wheelchair access. I was extremely surprised by this. 

Are there no government regulations preventing ownership from this behaviour towards people with special needs? 

Wow!"}
{"text":"Ah, the Keg. A family favourite when I lived in Vancouver. In Calgary, however, there are so many more options.

We waited 20 minutes for a canned beer and a too spicy Caesar (and I have a high spice tolerance). 

We waited 30 minutes for our medium rare steak, which arrived well-done. When our server dropped it off, she said it looks overcooked but it was only because of the natural light. Well, when there is no pink inside and it taste well-done and it looks well-done, I disagree. I didn't send it back because she would have just said it wasn't well-done, its just the lighting (which makes no sense to me). The steak had good flavour. The scallop and bacon was really tasty. The scallop was perfectly cooked, meaty and sweet. 

Keg, it's not the 1990's anymore, I think you ought to up your game. But what do I know? The restaurant was packed with customers."}
{"text":"I ordered the Teriyaki Top Sirloin dinner entree...i immediately regretted it. First off the food came out extremely slow, but the waitress was very attentive and nice so it didn't bother me much. However, the most atrocious thing was that I asked for a medium rare, and got a steak well done. 

Now I was on a business trip with my boss and his colleagues and they seemed to enjoy their meal, so I didn't want to complain and make a scene. My guess is that since the meat was marinated it was difficult for the chef to see how cooked the meat was. The salad was ok, but then again how do you mess up Caesar salad.  

The sides were good on the other hand, good grilled vegetables and the garlic roasted mashed potatoes were on point, especially if you ask for some prime rib au jus to pour over it. If this was an Applebees or Outback Steakhouse level establishment, I would have given the restaurant more slack but this place is simply way too overpriced for such a mediocre meal."}
{"text":"Really impressed!

We arrived on a Friday night around...6pm. There were 10 of us. We were quoted 20-30 minutes.
After 45minutes...we started getting antsy and the littlest of us (being the kids) began getting hungry and restless.
The manager actually approached ilis to appologize for the long wait. We requested that some \"kid friendly\" appitizers be started so they'd be ready when we finally sat down. 
When we did sit down...we were treated to  plates of veggies and bread for every kid, and 4 hot appatizers for the adults...all complimentary for our troubles.
Classy way to handle the sutuation.
Servers were increadible. Quick and very personable.
Food was all great and a good time was had by all.
I am always very appreciative of any hospitality industry iffering which acknowledges there mistakes and goes above and beyond to ensure you still leave satisfied.
Top notch!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here for a late night dinner date on a Friday (8pm dinner).  The supper rush had just ended half and hour ago, so the restaurant was only half full.
   Our server Christopher was extremely knowledgeable in both the wine and the food menus.  
For our appetizers, we had the scallops wrapped in bacon (yum) and the Atlantic and Dungeness crab cakes (lots of shredded crab, not too much breadcrumbs, great seasoning).  Alas, the crab cakes weren't as good as the ones in Maryland, USA.
Mains:   The Manhattan steak(topped with shrimp, scallops and Dungeness crab meat), grilled     medium rare, was meltingly tender and juicy.  The seafood topping worked excellently with my steak.  I asked for more vegetables instead of mashed potatoes or fries since I'm trying to stay away from carbs these days.   The vegetables were okay;
they were under seasoned but cooked to tender-crisp.  The red peppers were almost raw. 
Hubby had the bacon wrapped blue cheese steak.  I didn't get to taste his because I don't like blue cheese.

Dessert: we had mini desserts: brownie, creme brulee, ice cream and butter tart.  The brownie was a bit dense and heavy, but the creme brulee and ice cream were delicious.  The centre of the butter tart was a bit too gooey for my taste."}
{"text":"This is my favorite keg location. I come here every few months and the service has been great, even at peak hours. I have also found the food quality here to be better than other locations, I love the filet mignon with mashed potatoes! Their cheesecake is also excellent, I love the fresh cherry topping!"}
{"text":"The steaks we ate here this past week were some of the best we have had in some time. The filets was beyond tender - both the one requested as blue rare and the other one medium rare were done to perfection. These were much better quality steaks than those served at one of the newer much more expensive steak houses just north of downtown. The sides were also really tasty and served piping hot- can't resist the double baked potato. Parking is free for 3 hours- you just have to get the correct ticket from the machine."}
{"text":"As always the Keg never disappoints. We were there last weekend and our waiter Will was fantastic! We ordered a ceaser salad which didnt make it to us before the main course. Not really a big deal at all but when we asked if they had forgotten they brought one out right away at no charge and then comped our dessert. Thanks so much to the manager Theo and Will for the great customer service. :)"}
{"text":"My mother prefers dining in lounge, which at this location is downstairs. Dark. But more than that. Although the basement is quite large and open, I really felt like I was in a basement. But this is what a steakhouse, for some reason, is suppose to be I guess. My experience was okay, but I wonder whether it would have been quite a bit better in the actual dining room. My first recommendation: go to the dining room.

I really don't mind chain restaurants generally. They have their place. My experience at the Keg was nothing spectacular. The food was good but not great. My steak was cooked more than how I ordered it (I didn't send it back because we waste so much food already in the service industry...anyways, it was still okay). Our server was bubbly and friendly. The price was on the higher end of chain restaurants but not overly so. Still, more than I think it is worth.

Overall I don't have much to complain about. The thing is, I also have little to praise."}
{"text":"A - List. Recommended. Still going strong after all these years. Great food and service. This one is a winner."}
{"text":"The Keg, in general, is a pretty descent steakhouse -- but this particular location went above and beyond normal everyday customer service. My other half and I went for a weekend dinner, and as usual the place was bustling with customers. Not wanting to wait we opted to sit in the lounge.

We ordered our desired dishes and waited an acceptable 20 min for them to arrive. My spouse's dish was impeccable. Made exactly as we asked. Mine, on the other hand, was cooked a little dry and quite well done -- not how I had wanted it. I politely informed the waiter who promptly replaced it with the meal as I requested and discounted a portion of our bill.

While the meal was a bit disappointing initially, it's the service that won me over on this occasion. I will be back!"}
{"text":"For date night with my wife, we chose the Keg because we hadn't been to a steakhouse in a while. We started with appies: bacon wrapped scallops and crab cakes. Caroline had the lobster and mushroom-topped 7 oz. New York steak, medium rare. My bacon-wrapped, bleu cheese and roasted garlic topped 7 oz.New York steak was tender, juicy, and paired well with a glass of J. Lohr Cabernet Sauvignon. Delicious food, attentive service, and being later in the evening, a quieter ambiance than during the dinner rush. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here. It was my first time at the keg, and I just got the Baked Brie appetizer but it was really good! I love cheese so I might be a bit biased but it was so good for a light dinner. I also got the mini fudge brownies dessert but it was actually a great portion size for $3. I wouldn't even say it's mini. Definitely get it if you want to get dessert because for $3 you won't regret it. The person that seated us was very fun and amusing. Our server was friendly and she knew the menu well; she gave those of us that were first-timers a quick tour of the menu which was useful. She was quick and polite the whole time. The restaurant is very clean and it wasn't too crowded during Tuesday dinner. Quality of the food is great. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Recently, I had celebrated my birthday at The Keg. I knew what to expect. Great Top Sirloin, and that's what I got. I don't really have anything negative to say aside from the fact that my sister's sirloin was not cooked the way she had liked, but other than that, the waitress was existent and the food was good."}
{"text":"Steak dinner isn't really my thing, so I'll keep this short, but the venue  is quite elegant, the service is professional, and the menu is what you'd expect (nothing more, nothing less) from a steakhouse.  It's a little pricey ($20-$40 for a steak entree with standard sides), and you're probably paying about $5-$10 for the ambiance itself (which I seldom find value in, but if you're looking for a nice place to dine, this does qualify).

I won't say that I found the food spectacular, but as I said, steak dinner isn't really my thing so I'll reserve judgment."}
{"text":"Came here last night for an impromptu dinner with my mom. I've always been a HUGE fan of the Keg - which is odd because I tend to frequent independent restaurants rather than chains. But sometimes you just need the comfort of a good steak. We sat ourselves downstairs in the lounge, but were left unattended for over 5 minutes. We were getting antsy and wondering whether or not anyone saw us walk in, so I approached a well dressed gentleman (assuming he was the manager) and let him know we were waiting for a server and weren't sure if anyone saw us walk in. He apologized profusely and we were tended to by an adorably sweet server named Adele. We ordered drinks and the Mushrooms Neptune (my fave!!) and shortly after our steaks arrived. Everything was cooked well, to be expected, which is what we wanted. I enjoy the Keg because you know what you're going to get, and it almost always tastes delicious. When we finished up, the manager I had talked to initially (Travis) approached our table to apologize again for having to wait. We of course said it was no big deal, but he comped our mushrooms for our trouble. I thought that was a really awesome thing to do - most restaurants would apologize and leave it at that, but the fact that he actually cared about our dining experience really stuck out to me. I will absolutely return, hopefully soon, and I cant wait to eat my leftovers for lunch (Teriyaki Sirloin & Twice Baked Potato mmmmmm....)!!!"}
{"text":"First time ever there.  Was really busy but we didn't have long to wait.  For such a busy place we didn't wait long to be waited on.  Our server was kind in answering our questions about the menu and choices we had.  Have to say the Prime Rib was divine and so tasty...the horseradish was the way it is suppose to be hot and with a bite.  Every mouthful was a treat.  Now their desserts were fantastic.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this Keg location in ages and finally ended up here again a few days ago for a birthday dinner.  The overall experience was average.  I enjoyed my Creole Chicken but the other two thought their steak was overdone and our bread was totally crushed.  However, what disappointed me was this: upon making the reservation and being seated at the restaurant, the staff were reminded that it was a birthday occasion and despite this, it was forgotten.  The server brought the bill, which is when we decided we weren't going to let them get away with overlooking instructions, so he was reminded about the birthday.  \"Oh, I forgot about that.\"  He then bought a desert menu but offered no apology.

I have no desire to revisit this Keg.

30/30 for Yelp's 30 Day Challenge"}
{"text":"This keg has been great whenever I go.
Usually with family for a birthday or celebration. The food is fantastic, reasonable waiting times, staff have always been professional and friendly. Love the atmosphere - will be back!!"}
{"text":"Speaking as a vegetarian visitor to this establishment: Obviously this is not the place to go for an abundance of meat-free options. However, I was pretty excited about the Cauliflower \"Steak\" option in the \"Casual Meals\" dinner menu. When I asked about it, the server said, \"Honestly, it's not my favourite.\" This is fine and dandy to say, but when it is one of two options (the other being a Caesar salad) to have as a meal, it's a bit of a downer, ha ha. The meal itself had a delicious topping and nice side of asparagus, but the \"steak\" was essentially a raw slice of cauliflower. I would have expected something more cooked and infused with flavour, so it was a bit of a disappointment - a healthy one, though! The appetizer of fried cauliflower was super delicious, though. Also, no non-dairy milk for tea, but it's a small thing. 

Overall, I think my meat-eating company enjoyed their food and I saw potential in mine that was only partially fulfilled."}
{"text":"Wow I'm very impressed!! My friend had his birthday party with about 30 people and wow such great food and service. When we finally got our table and sat down we were treated with such great attention. We had 2 great servers that remembered our drink orders and everything we ordered. Not a single time did I need to flag down one of them for a refill.

Usually with such large parties the kitchen has difficulties coping with having the food come out at the same time, hot, fresh. My expectation was food that has been cooking on the heat lamps for the last 20 mins. Was I in for a surprise. The food was fresh, hot and cookies perfectly!! The servers were even generous enough to give us a few free shots for my friends birthday for apparently messing up one of our dessert orders. I don't think they did but free drinks. Woooo!! 

All in all, great food, great service! Definitely went above and beyond!

Ordered
1. 14oz prime rib with a side of mash $34 (was such a good deal if you don't want the prime rib combo that includes the salad)"}
{"text":"The food is very standard and is not bad... The service is slow... Very friendly, but could be faster... The cocktails are ok: Nothing really awesome, but not bad... I think I would go back there only if I have no choice, but I would prefer to go somewhere else in the area..."}
{"text":"I find the Keg to be quite inconsistent with its service and food.  One day it will be awesome and delicious, but the next it will be dull and disappointing.  I guess it just depends on the day of the week.

I find that sometimes my steak is cooked to perfection, but more often than not it's a little more cooked than I would like.  That would be fine, except at those prices I expect it to be perfect every time.  I don't want to be paying $30 for a steak that I don't enjoy.

And don't even get me started on their sides.  The vegetables always seem like they were frozen, and then overcooked.  They're all mixed together and, frankly, just taste like onion.

I think there are probably better steakhouses out there, since I don't always enjoy my time at The Keg.  Maybe next time it will be great, but maybe it won't.  Who knows with this place?"}
{"text":"Great steakhouse. Spouse had the Top Sirloin accompanied with the Short Rib/Beef on Beef special was cooked perfectly and the vegetable choice of asparagus paired perfectly. Enjoyed the roasted red pepper garnishment.  I chose something I've never eaten in a restaurant  Seared rare Ahi Tuna with a soy sesame dressing.  I have food allergies and the wait staff was kind enough to let me substitute asparagus for the slaw. After a short explanation of my allergies the kitchen manager also came out to verify & assure me they would be certain of no cross contamination. Very impressed with the quality of customer services.  We also enjoyed a Rickard's Red Beer. Definitely a restaurant we would visit again when visiting Calgary. Nice ambiance although some of the background music was not something I enjoy."}
