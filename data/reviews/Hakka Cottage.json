{"text":"Food is excellent..  definitely one of the best Hakka restaurants in town...love the Bombay chicken, red beef with coconut curry, hakka chicken noodle..  you will be hooked!..."}
{"text":"I rarely ever give 2 star as I respect all restaurants and businesses. However the reason why am giving one star is primarily quality of the food. Restaurant was very clean service was very nice however if the quality of the food is not healthy I have to give one star. I had PAD TAI it looks very nice it looked fresh but the sauce and preservatives are very artificial I only eat organic food and for more than five hours I've been feeling the after affects of the terrible quality preservatives that are used in the food. I'm sorry to sound so negative but I would not recommend this to people that are professionals with eating Hakka food."}
{"text":"It's very clean, service is fast and the server was very helpful. Food was pretty good. I would suggest hot & sour soup."}
{"text":"Great food and service!

Went on short notice with a group of ten including a toddler and infant and they accommodated us very quickly and happily. 

Ordered a number of dishes including:
Bubble teas (6 very unique orders)
Bombay Shrimp
Manchurian chicken
Chili Fish
Crispy Beef
Chicken lollipops
fish Pakoras
Vegetable Pakoras
Vegetable Singapore noodles
Beef Ho Fun
Thai Fried Rice
Mixed Vegetables
Red Thai Curry with shrimp

All were very tasty. My only issue was that the chutney served with the apps was too thin.

Will come back"}
{"text":"First time trying this place - so happy we did! Food is extremely tasty - Bombay chicken is a must! Ordered chicken pakora, Cantonese chow mein and curry chicken spring rolls. Yum!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here...he got the wrong order and I had the beef and broccoli.  Both were pretty rough."}
{"text":"A decent place to dine-in but alot of folks were also doing takeouts. I went in with some office colleges for lunch. Plenty of seating, the server was very friendly, food came out in a decent time and was hot!

Lunch pricing was friendly on the pocket but even the regular pricing was good. I ordered the chilli chicken with egg fried rice and hot & sour soup, which was decent but I have had better. We also ordered some spring roll, which weren't the best. 

Overall the restaurant & tables were clean . Parking is not a problem as its part of a plaza. 

For my muslim folks - they had a sign full halal menu."}
{"text":"Ordered from here the first time and was very very dissapointed!! Chilli chixken was red raw!! Asked for spicy noodles they were cold and not spicy at all! And they forgot to deliver our drinks. Not going back+!"}
{"text":"Great food, clean dining area, phenominal service. 8 of us were in for lunch, 8 different plates, best of the best were the general tao chicken mango chicken and curry beef, spent just under $80 with tip. Definitely some of the best Hakka in the city."}
{"text":"Best hakka food i had. BOMBAY CHICKEN IS A MUST GUYS.... They are very welcoming and ask you feedback abt the food. The food is very delicious and will go back there for sure. Im planning to try all their menus haha.


I cant wait for home delivery.!!!!!"}
{"text":"There were so many options on the menu and I had no idea what to order.  I asked the waitress for a recommendation on a noodle dish and I went with the house special Hakka noodles.  It was velvety and delicious! For $10, I received a massive amount of noodles.

The restaurant is clean and modern offering plenty of seating inside.

Easy parking in the private lot.

{"text":"My favourite were the veggie noddles. Fast and friendly service. Very busy but still they manage fast service. Soup is delicious too. We ordered the Bollywood Chicken and the Chicken pakora. Very good"}
{"text":"This place is pretty close by (sort of).  Their lunch specials are amazing value.  I love the hakka noodles, which you can substitute instead of rice (did that make sense?).  I like the chili chicken dry and crispy beef.  Also the Beef and Broccoli is pretty good.  I feel like I also get a spring roll.  It's a lot of food.  We tend to order 3 lunch specials and have a good lunch and lots to have the next day.  (I'm totally lazy, so I have a few meals I don't have to cook).

Great place."}
{"text":"We took a flyer on this place as we needed a quick bite after landing in TO before hitting the highway.

It's a bit unassuming tucked in a strip mall so close to a well advertised fish and chip spot that you may miss it all together.

Hakka is a Chinese noodle much less popular than the better known Chow Mien. The menu is extensive as you'd expect with a moto of \"Specializing in Indian Hakka Chinese Cuisine\".  Just the cuisine of two billion people.

We ate off the lunch menu which is an excellent deal at between $6-$8 including a drink. I exchanged Hakka Noodles for rice with my General TSO chicken, which is a deep fried slightly coated dish.

The food was really delicious. The Hakka noodles are a really nice addition to any meal, nutty and nice texture. The chicken had a great flavour and was perfectly cooked.

Service is polite and attentive. The place is clean, including the washrooms, and  tastefully decorated. 

Definitely pass on the fish&chips and go for some Indian Chinese! You won't go wrong."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on my way to work. It's a small restaurant with a capacity of about 40. Lunch menu had may items from $5.99 to $6.99. I ordered chilly chicken from the lunch menu and substituted rice with Hakka noodles for $1.75. Comes with vegetarian spring roll or daily soup and I got the soup. The service is quick and food was out in no time. The hot and sour soup was bit thick but yummy. The chilly chicken came on a bed of noodles and was good. Forgot to ask them to make it spicy but the had hot sauce and chilly in vinegar on the table. Portion was good. Paid $10 including tax and tips."}
{"text":"It was good.. tried hakka chicken noodles they made it slicy on my request.. taste was good but chicken was really hard to find.. wish i had taken a picture."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this little gem purely by accident. It was late summer and our excitement had been building all morning anticipating another delicious meal at Faley but, when we arrived, there was a sign on the door indicating it was closed until the end of August! Talk about build me up, buttercup.  As my colleagues' tears started to set in, I knew I had to quickly come up with a Plan B. Then I remembered that there was another Hakka restaurant in the same plaza. We were all in agreement that we would try it but didn't expect too much.

It was about the same size as Faley, the d√©cor was simple and it was very clean. We all ordered off the lunch special menu - mango chicken, crispy beef and dry chili fish. Similar to Faley, the food arrived very quickly, it was hot and fresh and the portions were quite generous. It's difficult to compare it to Faley as it's a different interpretation on Hakka cuisine so it would depend on your taste palate. Faley's dishes are a bit more bold and saucy, whereas here, I could more taste the Asian influence. We all really enjoyed the food as it was prepared with good quality ingredients, not greasy and no MSG. Prices were competitive as well; the specials were all under $7.00 and came with rice, springroll (delicious) or soup. We even ordered food to take home from the regular menu.

Service was not as entertaining as Faley; however, our server was very sweet and accommodating and, when we were leaving, the owner genuinely thanked us for our business.

My only complaint is regarding the Manchurian Shrimp Hakka Noodle. It was very flavorful, had great texture, good portion size BUT it only had about a dozen small shrimp. At first I thought they gave me vegetarian in error.

The long and short is if you're a foodie that wants to branch out to various Hakka restaurants or if you're craving Hakka and it's a Tuesday when Faley is closed, Hakka Cottage is an excellent alternative.

NOTE: I'm not sure if they accept credit cards."}
{"text":"They're new and a breathe of fresh air. Very nice ambience and the waitress is courteous and helpful.  The food is delcious too.  The meat was not too crisp and not too tender but just right. We liked it so much, we even took a lot of it to go. I couldn't stop eating it afterwards.  It's a Halal restaurant so I hope they don't get a liquor license.  Then they will have many many Muslims in the area come over for feast. They deserve to be recognized.  My only regret is I didnt book my birthday dinner with friends here instead of the hakka restaurant a few doors down which was an epic fail this time."}
{"text":"This restaurant has opened up in competition to a very well known Hakka restaurant in the same plaza. I gave Hakka Cottage a chance and I wasn't dissapointed. Service was very good, and the food was really flavourful and delicious. The ManChow soup is on top of my list as it free from Soy Sauce. Next is definetly the Bombay chicken and Chili Chicken. And they have lunch specials all day so you don't end up ordering too much. The restaurant is very spacious and clean. To be honest I have gone back loads of time's and I've finally made an effort to write a review. 

Food: 10
Decor: 10
Service: 8"}
{"text":"Update....Went back as I was in the area and had a craving for good Hakka, walked in was not too busy, most tables were used and waiting to be cleaned, so seating was kinda limited....was apprehensive since my last visit was not great.

This time a different person took my order and she confirmed everything before hand. I ordered the Szechuan chicken with noodles and hot and sour soup, pop was also included in their lunch special. Soup arrived luke warm like the last time, had some but did not finish...it was tasty tho. The main event was perfect!! The chicken was very good and the sauce complemented the noodles well, spice was also the right level for me, I would rate it hot but on the milder side for those who are interested. For those new to Hakka, expect cartilage in the meal here.

So I increased my rating as they do deserve 4 stars, food here is very good and I would recommend it to others, pricing for lunch ranges from $5.95-$6.95 which is good considering the good portion size, upgrade to noodles is another $1.75 .  If you don't mind the minor quirks, you'll enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Had a dinner there with relatives during our trip to Niagara Falls. It is a very neat restaurant. Good food, good portion, reasonable price, nice decoration, and good service. Cannot ask for more when you are traveling in an area you are not familiar with and randomly pick a restaurant from Yelp."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Definitely one of my fav hakka restaurants. Strong flavours all around and their hot sour soup was on point. Definitely recommend the Bombay chicken and the green curry. The green curry was so flavourful. It was, dare I say it, even comparable to high end Thai restaurants like Pai but for fraction of the cost! The owner served us and he was super nice and accommodating. If you're not from around here, lock your cars cause the plaza ain't no gated community."}
