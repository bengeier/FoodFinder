{"text":"Nouriture correct. Ambiance ordinaire. C'est écrit que c'est ouvert pour le dîner, mais la place ouvre à 17h00 depuis l'automne passé. On retrouve toujours des déco de Noel, et nous sommes en mars!"}
{"text":"I had nachos and beer, both were to my liking. Not a fine dining experience, more of a pub menu even though it's not exactly a pub.

There are large private booths at the back with big flat screen TVs so you can watch movies. Neat idea, though I've never actually done it.

Every Tuesday night there's a Street Fighter 4 tournament in the back on said TVs. People bring their gaming sticks and consoles, it's pretty intense but they seemed to be having fun. There's a $2 entry fee and my waitress said it lasts until the wee hours. Crazy to see."}
{"text":"Not a mean one star, just a really really mediocre place. Waitress was sweet but she said a total of 3 words to me. They overcomplicated their menu (you get 3 menus) and the food was very bland. Fresh ingredients were lacking and everything just seemed cooked from frozen. I can't speak to their drink menu but i definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Well..
 They are finally  closed, sorry for you guys but like any other type of businesses you have to evolve and adapt.
Cet endroit n'est pas bien gérer plutôt  un bar qu' un resto"}
