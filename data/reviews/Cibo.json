{"text":"Amazing wine list, fantastic pizzas with unusual toppings, and gnutella crepes for dessert.  It doesn't get any better.  Not to mention that the service is excellent and friendly, and the atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming, something that you don't usually experience in a place as hip as Cibo.  I get nervous going out to trendy places because I'm scared of getting dirty looks from rich people, but this was not my experience at Cibo.  Just sitting on their patio is a relaxing experience, what with the lovely foliage, glass of wine, and beardy waiter.  I always want to go back when I've got the cash.  Great for a date or special event."}
{"text":"We have visited this place multiple times over the past few years and when I found out they had a private room for me and my guests I was so excited! At first they were very accommodating, they let us see the room and discuss how we were going to set it up for our party and went over the menu's with us. It came as a big surprise to me when we showed up and had to wait over an hour and a half for our first course to come out! Everything just went downhill from there. We complained to our server multiple times (we had 1 server for a party of 40) that the room was extra hot and there was nothing done about it. I had about 10 guests having to get up to try and cool down outside, fanning themselves and sweating throughout the dinner. Then when half of our guests left I realized they never sent out dessert and we had to ask for it! I was then told we should have requested dessert to come out, what kind of restaurant waits 45 minutes to bring dessert after a meal is finished?

My BIGGEST disappointment was how the catering manager, Michelle, handled everything after I sent her an email. I understand that she is the owner's wife but I've had teenagers talk to me nicer than she did. She was brash and offensive. Not only did she not take blame for anything she blamed our party for all of the issues. You can count on the fact that I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone and will have negative things to say when asked; which is unfortunate because I work downtown and a lot of people always ask me for recommendations. I sure hope the lack of customer service turns people off from dining here, you are better off going to Cheesecake Factory!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try Cibo as it was part of a \"discount card\" fundraiser we had signed up for & when I looked at their website/menu online, they identified themselves as \"gluten free friendly\" and more than happy to accommodate any allergy/dietary needs and as a GF girl, anytime an Italian place says they have GF pasta, I'm pretty happy! We dined on a Saturday evening, with reservations. 

I usually try and keep it pretty positive when it comes to reviewing restaurants but our experience was the complete opposite of positive and I hope some changes can be made their in the future because their food had some great elements & their owner was nice but other than that....ugh. 

When I mentioned that I am GF and asked if I could get the Chicken Parm but without breadcrumbs (which I would normally not even think to ask for but since they had identified themselves as being willing to accomodate allergies I went ahead and asked), I was told the chef \"is busy and wouldn't want to do that but that he could just put some grilled chicken on top of the pasta but she didn't want to ask him to make it \"parmesan\" style, even though I'm pretty sure that would just consist of putting some sauce and cheese on top. I can understand when things are busy it is hard to accomodate special requests (even simple ones like mine) but as a customer (who is paying $20 + for dinner), I don't think I should have to worry about if my order will stress the chef out. Either don't claim to be GF friendly or get some more kitchen help? In the end, I ended up paying a pretty high price for noodles, marinara sauce & grilled chicken :( 

Our waitress only smiled when she was dropping off the check & we only smiled when we could finally leave."}
{"text":"Genova pizza is amazing.  Pesto that will light up your palate. Potato that smoothes each bite.  Italian brick oven pizza crust. Simply amazing. Go enjoy."}
{"text":"It was on a Sunday afternoon when I planted my heart in this restaurant. I didn't expect to fall in love with the d√©cor not to mention the food...I was a little nervous ordering but after I ate their pizza my belly didn't have any bad reaction to their cheese or meat so I was relieved. I will definitely return"}
{"text":"The service is great and atmosphere is terrific. The pizza was good, but I wasn't necessarily impressed with the crepes for dessert. Too much Nutella and not enough bananas. Appetizer we had was sub par. Personally I don't see what all the hype is with this place. Not a bad experience by any means though."}
{"text":"We adore this place!! The gluten free crepes are to die for!!! We always have great service and  get seated quickly. We have had a few issues with our orders but they are always willing to go above and beyond to make them right!!! Which we highly appreciate!"}
{"text":"Best place ever! Love the Diavola and house salad! It's far from my house but well worth the 35min drive for some good pizza!"}
{"text":"Tried Cibo for the first time with my family, recommend by my sister who loves their gluten free options. We started with a berry crepe which was delicious. Tons of berries and homemade whip cream. I ordered the Porcellino for lunch. I've always loved sandwich's and out of my top 10 favorites the Porcellino moved up to 1st place. The BBQ pork melts in your mouth with warm fontina cheese. The bread is like pizza dough and is cooked in their brick oven. Its crispy, juicy, a little spicy, and so warm. I never write reviews on yelp but for this restaurant I had to. I can't wait to visit again and try the spek or Pastrami or really any of the saltimboccas. PS the bloody Marys were soooooo good and the OJ is freshly squeezed."}
{"text":"Cibo is absolutely fantastic!!!

The patio is the perfect spot to enjoy their authentic pizza.  Have the quatro frommagio... it is the best I've ever had!  Love the fact that the owners are there most nights, and the staff are really fun and friendly."}
{"text":"Terrific little beautiful place. Intimate but not pretentious. Always delish. Love it!"}
{"text":"Been to Cibo several times and have had no problems with the food, but what I don't go out to dinner for is a flat out RUDE server. My room mates and I went to Cibo on a thursday night and got right in as we chose to sit inside, i.e.. the place was not swamped as it is on a weekend night. We waited so long to even be helped in the first place that had to finally ask someone if we HAD a server as we would liked to have ordered a bottle of wine. When we ordered apps, as we couldn't pronounce what we wanted, we pointed it out on the menu to the server, so she clearly saw it. However when an antipasti platter came out and we said that wasn't our order, the food runner took it back to our server, who brought it back out to us and continued to argue with us that we did in fact order the antipasti, which we hadn't. Our pizza took so long we actually had time to finish the bottle of wine and could have fallen over if we'd gotten any eye contact or mention of our pizza and where it may have gone. I don't care how amazing the food or how popular the restaurant, servers with poor attitudes are never worth the time and money."}
{"text":"My woman took me out to go eat at this place.It was actually pretty awesome.I love the authentic atmosphere, and how fast the service is.The shop is tucked away into a little over-looked place in downtown Phoenix, and it's just wonderful...especially if you want a quiet date.



Five out of five, no doubt."}
{"text":"Great pizza! All of the ingredient were fresh and high quality.
Awesome patio! I didn't try the pasta, but will next time. Very cool old house converted into the restaurant. Good experience!"}
{"text":"Ah-mazing! I love this Phoenix gem! It's my go to for celebrations, a place to take visiting guest, date night, night with the girls, all occasions! Prepare to indulge and do not count count calories.  You're eating quality ingredients with remarkable flavors.  The Barrata is superb! Smooth creamy Barrata with aged sweet balsamic vinegar and thin cuts of prosciutto on toasted bread is a must! Pizzas, oh the pizzas...are made in a wood fired oven and offer the perfect toasted yet chewy crusts. I highly recommend the Diavola if you like spice.  You can always add a touch of coolness by adding ricotta cheese. Secondly I recommend their Salsiccia con Potate. Baked chunks of seasoned potatoes with sausage and mozzarella. 

All desserts are wonderful, great coffees and homemade creamy lemoncello.  

Notes: Sunday brunch is offered with a slightly different menu. They also serve chorizo that is remarkable! They serve a pizza much like the Salsiccia con potate with pesto & onions.  Sounds strange but it's delicious! 

Homemade pastas served only 2 nights a week. Check their website. Currently it's Wed & Thurs. 

Only beer & wine; except at brunch where they offer Bloody Mary's. 

Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"im not a big fan of pizza, but coming to this place it changed my mind!!very fresh ingredients. so flavorful and light.  cibo you will see me here again the next time im in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We ate dinner Sat night this last.  I hardly eat pizza because but this was worth the carb sacrifice.  Fabulous marinara sauce with capers and anchovies.  The entry salad was huge but not overbearing.  B4 dinner the bartender gave us a couple tastes of some wines.  Place has a great vibe and excellent energy.  Our server, Marissa, did a great job and had some game taking care of us.  There were four of us and i would recommend sharing.  We live at cactus and 101st st but this was worth the road trip and will do it again soon.

My wife and her friend Nicole are gluten free and you could not tell the difference in taste of the crusts."}
{"text":"Very nice patio, and great food! We enjoyed a beautiful lunch here with our friends...nice view of the city skyline too! I felt like I was in Italy."}
{"text":"Ambiance, service, deliciousness. One of the few places I will eat gluten and dairy for. To die for. Light, quality, amazing."}
{"text":"Don't really have much to say, was expecting more flavor and excitement from the Calzone.....it was just like the date you been waiting for several months, then she arrives, stunning, beautiful, and sexy as hell....then she opens her mouth and starts talking-  check  please !!"}
{"text":"Came with a large group of friends, so we ordered a few pizzas, and I had a chance to try multiple items from their menu. Not at all appetizing. Crust was dry and flavorless and the topping choices were very limited, with no good sauces to pick from. I felt I was eating a week-old bread with leaves on top. Seriously the WORST pizza I ever had (and I tried many in Mass, RI, NYC, CA, and AZ). 

I thought, well maybe at least I can enjoy some drinks and have a nice time hanging out with my friends... WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Terrible waitress service - guess she didn't have to try hard, since the tip was added to the bill due to our large group size, but still she was on the margin of being MEAN to the point I felt awkward to ask her to take our picture :/ 

This place ruined my evening out!! Usually I give restaurants another chance if something went wrong the first time, but I am never, ever coming back here - that's how bad it was."}
{"text":"Really good place loved it especially afternoon lunch!"}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5
Service: 4/5
Cleanliness: 3.5/5
Atmosphere: 3.5/5
Price: $$

We quickly looked over the menu and figured out what to order, though we got some help from our server. We decided to order a pizza and scodellinas to share as we weren't too famished. The server helped us what to pick for our scodellinas (we decided to get 5) and explained to us how it worked as well. Essentially, they were spreads that we ate on crispy bread (crostini?).

We got: White gold ricotta, Gorgonzola dolce, Prosciutto di parma, Salt roasted golden beets, and roasted eggplant. All of the spreads seemed so delicious that we had some trouble choosing - we ended up getting some recommendations from our server as well to make life easier.

All of the spreads were really delicious and I personally thought that scodellinis were a great idea! I wished more restaurants offered them as a menu. Each spread was unique and creative, and they were all very flavourful. With the crispy bread, it was the perfect dish. I highly recommend you try them - it would be great to share among friends and family, or even enjoy them all on your own depending on your preferences!

As for our pizza, we decided to try the prosciutto pizza which doesn't seem like it's on the current menu anymore, though you can add prosciutto as an extra topping to your pizza. Hubby and I both love having arugula on our pizza (our love for it starts here) and paired with prosciutto, it was just lovely. The pizza dough itself wasn't too thick or thin to our liking, and overall it was a great pizza that we would love to order again when we visit Cibo next time.
Verdict

Overall, our light dinner at Cibo was very delightful. We sat by the window and had lots of help from our server who constantly checked on us. As we had our dinner quite early, the restaurant was still rather empty but I would imagine Cibo getting very busy in the evenings! It seems pretty popular Opentable as well, as it tells me that it's been booked 40 times today at time of my search.

The casual restaurant definitely is a great place for lunch or dinner, or even for happy hour. They have a great bar as well which is great for those who love to enjoy some sports TV or a drink or two.

I highly recommend the restaurant for a casual night out with your family, friends, significant other, or even by yourself if you're in the mood."}
{"text":"You want great authentic Italian food at a decent price? This is the place. Every pizza on the menu is terriffic (I think we've tried them all by now) but our favorites are the Tartufata (white pizza with white truffle oil) and and Diavola. Or maybe the Quattro Formaggi and La Noce.
We ALWAYS begin with the Burrata starter. More than enough for two people. In fact, I'm tempted to ask if we can get a 1/2 order. The wine list is modest and won't make you wince when you see the prices. If you're still hungry, the Fresca from the Dolci menu is simply amazing. The fruit crepe is MORE than enough for two people.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, Chef Guido make 3 homemade pasta dishes, usually around $13-15 per plate. Amazing stuff.
The service and servers are second to none. All very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time for dessert and fell in love with the Fresca crepe! Our server Yvonne was wonderful and friendly. We will definitely be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service, memorable experience!"}
{"text":"For those of us who live in Phoenix, it is not a surprise to find  out that  there is an ongoing Pizza war amongst pizza aficionados. Topping the list one has to mention, in no particular order; Grimandis, Humble Pie, Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco.
From home made mozzarella , to organic sourdough and the most expensive state of the art lava and wood burning ovens, eating pizza  here in Phoenix is a serious thing.
As a  full blooded Italian,, I have to say one thing; I do not like pizza.....I lOVE IT.
And with the company of my wife, I have made an effort to try and flavor every pizza establishment in the valley.The results have been outstanding and the experiences  worth writing in my pizza diaries.
But as in beauty and love (and pizza) I guess one has to deal with subjectivity. We all have different tastes and preferences,  so when it comes to choosing the best pizza, we try to stick with originality in flavor and  the consistency of its dough..  and while trying them all, I have found exquisite flavors and combinations, different dough textures created by each unique oven, and one particular pie that distinguishes itself from all of the others  because of its simplicity and originality.
And in my eternal quest to find the most original pizza, that is the one that most closely resembles the true pizza........the one that originated in the 1830s in Napoli, baked in an oven built with lava rocks from mount Vesubio,  I have to mention two contenders; CIBO and Pizzeria Bianco.
For 15 years, Pizzeria Bianco located at 623 E Adams  street in downtown Phoenix, has been a favorite amongst pizza aficionados for making pizzas that truly resemble  a pizzeria Napolitana.
Owner, Chris Bianco , decided that the only way to create an authentic pizza, was to travel to the place of its origin, Napoli, and learn the art of pizza making.  His internship paid well and today when one eats at his pizzeria, there is no doubt that his pizzas are a very close duplicate of what one would get in Napoli.
Not even a mile apart, one finds another jewel in the pizza arena; CIBO Pizzeria.  Cibo translate simply into\" the food\". If you are a true pizza aficionado, you must try this pizzeria in order to truly understand the art in the making of truly artisan pizza.
Karen and Tony Martingiglio are the owners of this small and charming old house located at 603 5th ave in downtown Phoenix. It resembles a true Italian osteria.( an Italian eatery where local wines are flavored and where people come to have a great time with friends and eat home made dishes) Friendly, charming, and warm, Cibo  makes you feel at home eating with your mamma.
Pizzas here are crafted by a true transplanted pizza maker from Napoli; artisan Guido Saccone.

Pizza Margherita is probably an exact copy of what one would expect to eat in Napoli.  From the chewy lightly burned dough relieved with bubbling volcanoes,  to the simple earthy  tomato sauce and fresh basil, this pizza is heavenly.
And if I was placed in the predicament of choosing my favorite, I  would undoubtedly pick Cibo; after all there is an authentic  artisan from Napoli crafting these wonderful pies."}
{"text":"The only way I can describe this restaurant is perfect! After returning from Europe this summer, I have been craving a cozy atmosphere and tasty quattro formaggi pizza. I found both plus a surprise treat of excellent live jazz music. We also ordered bruschetta and crepes. Everything was exceptional!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It gives you a relax and warming atmosphere, where you can either enjoy with your significant other or with a group of friends. Every time I been here, makes me want to jump into airplane and fly to Venice, Italy."}
{"text":"The pizza is decent but the standout here is the antipasto plate.  They also have some great beers and I like the small house feel to the place.  Great spot next door too, palate."}
{"text":"I love their mushroom pizza and their fresca dessert. Going during dinner is much better, I went during lunch and the vibe is different. The service was not as good as in the evening. 
Definetly a place to visit often."}
{"text":"I'm from New York, so you can bet the firs thing I asked everyone when I moved to Phoenix was \"where should I get some good pizza?\"  Everyone responded \"Pizzeria Bianco!,\" but a few wise ones told me to avoid the crazy wait and check out Cibo.  Still haven't made it to Bianco, but why bother?  I've been to Cibo 3 times in the past few months and wouldn't have it any other way.

The service has always been spectacular.  There's a good selection of beer and wine, and an almost impossible-to-choose-from selection of pizzas.  We're not talking New York thin-slice sauce-and-cheese, we're talking locally sourced ingredients and artful combination.  Perfect crust topped with the perfect combination of delicious meats, cheeses, and veggies galore.

Your least favorite part of the meal will definitely be trying to pronounce the names of the pizzas.  Your favorite part of the meal might be the pizza, or it might be the ambiance (hard to decide between the cozy outside with live music and fire pit or the quaint inside that boasts everything downtown Phoenix is good at).  

Go with a group of friends and stay a while."}
{"text":"This place is THE BEST! The pizza is as close to authentic Italian as I've seen in Phoenix. The Prosecco is fantastic. The ambiance is cozy and inviting. This is the place to go if you want to impress guests."}
{"text":"Got the sausage pizza for lunch and found it to be tasty. Service was attentive and friendly, and the outdoor patio was really cute!"}
{"text":"Some people buy their wives jewelry, flowers or a puppy to say theyre sorry.. I just take mine to Cibo. Its the ultimate spot for good vibes and insanely addicting pizza. Definetly a gem I hope never dies."}
{"text":"Love happy hour here! $5 for a pizza and $4 for a pint of Mill St! How can you possibly go wrong?"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. I have a gluten allergy and their gluten free pizza and crepes are the best in Arizona! I have never had a bad meal there. 
They also have house made limoncello!"}
{"text":"I visited Cibo for a Iight, late dinner and was pleasantly surprised by the fresh food and beautiful patio.  The desert night sky looked lovely while I enjoyed the house salad and antipasti plate!  I hope to bring my family next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is, as the five stars suggests, as good as it gets.

If you are looking for a nice romantic dinner, Cibo offers it all. 

Great food and drinks, great location, and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, hands down; from the pesto salad to the calamari to the puzza, the BEST food I've had in a LONG time. I would recommend to evwryinw. The place it quaint and very friendly. The service was wonderful. You will not be disappointed.  I'll be coming back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I'm just going to start by saying we are 100% Italian, and moved here 1 month ago for studying purposes... We are SO grateful we found this place! The food tonight truly made us feel as if we were back at home: their ingredients are original and tasty, their meals are traditional, and we left feeling beyond satisfied. The food is cooked by a real Italian. 
We can't recommend this place enough for people that want to taste ACTUAL Italian food. 
Best Italian food you can have in town!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix and met up with an old friend at Cibo. When I was driving down the street I was a bit concerned that my GPS had led me astray since I was driving past houses all the way up until I saw the restaurant. The unassuming location made me feel like we had found this hidden spot only the lucky few knew about. The service was spectacular. Our waiter was attentive, water glasses were always filled (much appreciated since I was not used to AZ heat), and we felt welcomed. The waiter gave us some much needed guidance with the menu since everything listed sounded unique and amazing. I decided to go with a pizza that had potatoes on it and was thrilled with my decision. Both of our pizzas were delicious and we enjoyed some suggested wine.

 I thought the meal couldn't get any better... but then we ordered the nutella and banana crepe. Seriously it was one of the best crepes I have ever had. We sat outside and the atmosphere was charming and inviting. I felt as though I was sitting in my own garden or backyard. They have twinkle lights in the trees and you feel like you should be on a movie set. Next time I am in Phoenix Cibo will be my first stop!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the food, cannot put to words how good the soup, pizza, and wine was. Excellent, fresh tasting products used in their pizza. My only problem was the server was slow, seemed like he didn't know the menu well, and took roughly five minutes to open the bottle of wine. Service aside, this place has AMAZING pizza!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to visiting Cibo last night...and didn't realize what I was missing. My advice: Just GO! Everything you are reading is true! This place really is as good as it gets. The food is fabulous, the atmosphere is charming and service is great. Yes, I could nit-pick about some of the minor details (you know how I am!), but the overall experience can't be beat. Just GO!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian cuisine that never fails to deliver. The pasta specials are the closest to true Italian flavors I've found in the valley. The prices are incredibly reasonable and the ambiance is lovely."}
{"text":"Cibo needs no review, it's just that amazing! Service and ambiance are always spot on. It's definitely a place we frequent as a family, with friends, and any time we have guests in town."}
{"text":"CIBO is an open concept, 2 story restaurant with an excellent patio. You have to pay for parking but they have their own lot at the side of the restaurant. Their pizzas are amazing and they have one of the most original menus in Calgary. I'd recommend this place for date night or even a buisness lunch. The service has always been top notch as well. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Cibo has a simple menu but its done right. I had pizza there with a friend we order two pizza and shared with left overs to take home. Though i enjoyed the food Cibo's main plus is the atmosphere. An old charming house turned into a restaurant is a cozy and inviting feel. Sit outside before the weather turns unbearable. Great place for a date or just hanging with friends. Cibo's use of architecture and food is one of the signs phoenix can move in the right direction in city life."}
{"text":"I was visiting from California, and only came to Cibo because it seemed like the only edible place (that had good reviews) in Arizona. The exterior was surprising, it was basically a house that was converted to a restaurant. Once you walk in you immediately feel at home. I also loved how all the awards or that they have won were placed on the wall. 

Now... on to the food. I ordered pizza, I got half Diavola and half Genova. The Diavola is Tomato sauce - mozzarella and spicy salame and the Genova was Mozzarella - basil pesto - onions - roasted potatoes and grated parmimgiano. Hands down the Diavola was probably the best pizza I have ever had in a restaurant. It is a must get! Now the Genova, was good but it could have been better. I've never had potato on my pizza before but I felt like they were a little undercooked. Besides that it was also really good and had good flavor. 

If you are visiting AZ then definitely go here, you won't be disappointed. I just hope they expand to San Diego!"}
{"text":"Cibo is a contemporary Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh's Regent Square neighborhood.  My friend Danielle had a $10-off entr√©e coupon, so we decided to give it a go!  So, I did not experience a \"food-gasm,\" but that does not mean the experience was all that bad.  The staff was welcoming and the ambiance was quaint and clean.  I cannot figure out why the word \"contemporary\" is an adjective used to describe their cuisine.  I had Eggplant Parmesean, which was definitely fresh (not frozen), plentiful and comforting for dinner on a cold February night in Pittsburgh.  However, my ceasar salad that preceded the main entr√©e was presented as large hearts of romaine that might have made their way to the grill.  I don't like salad or any parts of it warm.  That was different and possibly a \"contemporary\" take on Italian food.  In the end, Danielle and I enjoyed ourselves, laughing from great seats overlooking the bustling Braddock Avenue.  I would most likely not go back, as the menu was a bit over-priced.  With everything priced a la carte and also a BYOB ($5 corkage fee),  I feel Cibo's marketing theme is confusing.  That's all for now. I didn't detest the experience, nor did I LOVE it.

{"text":"Had some appetizers, wine and pizza here. The food is great, especially the Scodellina and the calamari we had as appetizers. The pizza is Neapolitan style.

If I hadn't been drinking so much wine, I probably would have grown impatient with the service - our food took a long time to come out.

I'd like to come back here in the summer and try the patio."}
{"text":"Totally delightful. On a nice day/evening, this is the best patio to have breakfast (only on weekends), lunch or dinner. Everything is good. They have loads of vegetarian options and if something comes with meat they are down to accommodate. Some of my highlights: The Margherita pizza is legit, nuff said. Quattro Formaggio pizza add balsamic onions for a total treat that is kind of like the best french onion soup ever. The antipasto is so good (I get it without meat). The Burrata is really creamy and delicious, I sub the meat for tomatoes with pesto. Ho shi! Last recommendation, the crepes. Any of them. Oh, if the day is less than delightful, inside is completely charming as well. Basically, just go. You'll love it."}
{"text":"Consistent above average quality. In my book, that's a 5 star.

Is it my favorite pizza? No. But not having my favorite pizza doesn't disqualify them from a 5 star rating from me.

I love the quaint atmosphere, and the fact that the owners are there working, and interacting with the guests. I ventured out of the norm and had their calzone (I added sausage) on Friday, and I loved it.

I actually prefer their lunch menu, and wish I could get one of their wonderful sandwiches with a nice light salad for dinner. If I have one complaint it's that I can't get their sandwiches from the dinner menu.

Cibo gets repeat business from me, and that says a lot.

***ENTERTAINMENT VALUE****
It's often fun to sit outside (when it's not super hot) so that you can see people trying to head North on 5th Ave (a one-way South street at that part of town).

My last time at Cibo, I witnessed a woman with her boyfriend in the passenger seat heading West on Filmore and attempting to make a right onto 5th Ave (i.e. trying to go North). The driver behind the woman laid on his horn to get her attention. The woman was completely baffled, and her passenger contorted his body around so that he could look back that the driver behind his girlfriend and give him the finger. Heading North on Filmore, driving head-on into oncoming traffic, the woman got several more honks from cars going the right way on the one-way street. She finally took the hint, pulled into a driveway, and turned around. 5 minutes later, they took a seat with their friends, seated at the table next to mine, and sheepishly admitted to their friend that they were the ones who caused all the disturbance.

Calzone with Sausage: $15. Iced Tea: $2. Witnessing a guy defend his girlfriend's honor by flipping off some guy trying to help her only to later be almost killed by on-coming traffic: Priceless.

Cibo is the only restaurant I know that provides this type of live entertainment.

NOTE: If you are looking for a quiet spot to eat, Cibo is probably not it. If you are seated in certain parts of the house, it is often hard to hear what other people at your table are saying, and the reverberations make it possible to overhear other tables' conversations. I don't view this as something that takes away from the rating... just something the diner should be aware of about the ambiance.

Also, parking is a bit of an issue. If you don't like dealing with street parking, Cibo might not be for you. I don't like dealing with street parking, but I will for Cibo."}
{"text":"In my opinion this place is overrated. Margherita pizza was bland. The crust is well done, but the sauce and mozz were flavorless. Server and hostess were rude, won't be back."}
{"text":"I find Cibo is a hit and miss especially with the service.  While the restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the location is great I find the menu especially the current Fall/Winter 2014 to be quite weak and poorly balanced. I am definitely disappointed. Currently there are many rich and overly heavy foods and I do not feel there is balance in the menu. They no longer have creative and tasty salads for an entree nor as an option for an appetizer. There is no longer light appetizers either. We had ordered the Roasted Cauliflower as a starter and it was poorly put together and so heavy with all the cream and butter it left my stomach upset. If you like comfort food which is overly heavy and excessively oil based then this may be the place for you. If you prefer variety, taste, balance and flavour then I would recommend going elsewhere. I hope come Spring 2015 the menu is more impressive but for now I have no intention of returning."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and amazing food. Love the scotellinis and pizza. Have yet to try a pasta dish! The eggplant puree is divine and my pizza favorites are the mozzerella and the pepperoni. I have tried the wild boar twice and it can be quite greasy."}
{"text":"Food was great, but service lacked. A 11/2 hour wait for food with one dish arriving after everyone had finished. They did comp the late dish but a bit disconcerting for the pour guy who watched everyone else eat."}
{"text":"This restaurant is super cute! I loved the big outside patio and all of the tree lights. We ordered a pizza, a salad, and a sandwich. The pizza was ok, it was a little burnt in spots. The salad had a fresh taste but not a lot of flavor. The truffle fries that came with the sandwich were probably the best part of the meal. I would probably give this place one more shot."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Phoenix, plus it is super romanic."}
{"text":"I love Cibo's!!!  Way better than Pizzeria Bianco!  Much better menu for all to choose vs just a few \"fufu\" items!!"}
{"text":"Cibo hits all the right spots! Their pizza is some of the best I've had in the Valley- chewy, tender crust with that wood-fired taste and it's obvious that all of the toppings are high quality. 

Luckily I came here on a night when they were serving up handmade pasta and got to try the Orecchiette Bolognese which was delicious all around, perfectly sauced, and came with a small side salad. The portion was a bit small which was a tad disappointing for the $14ish price.

We rounded up the meal with the Banana Nutella Crepe with Ice Cream...the perfectly sweet way to end the meal! Cibo has a gorgeous patio space and live music on some nights. It was a bit chilly but there were ample heaters to keep us comfortable during our meal.

The service was a bit spotty and our waitress wasn't very sincere and seemed rushed, which was a bit irritating, but the food made up for that and that's why Cibo gets 4 stars in my book.  Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Very good healthy food! Relaxed environment for good conversation. Had a live single singing artist acoustic musician on the patio with little friendly birds to watch. I usually don't like birds because they are dirty, and leave surprises in my soda.  These were very small and the patio was clean of any bird poop. The restaurant is a little hipster-ish, but would definitely recommend for a lunch date! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Hi! I own the restaurant and my name is Cindy! Cindy seated or rather shoehorned us into a tiny space in the front window where we had to elbow other diners out of the way. This was our last interaction with Cindy the owner even though we were obviously less than thrilled with the table, food and service. Starter: bruschetta... Two types, one savory and
 yummy with cherry tomatoes , garlic and spice.
The other bland and under seasoned chunks of mushroom mixed with ricotta. Two types of salad... The caprese with Roma tomatoes which would have been fine but were too cold to appreciate. The same problem existed with the house Cibo salad and the too cold vegetables. Impossible to enjoy in that condition. Main courses: linguine with clams... Many of the clams were overdone and the dish was overall too spicy. Pasta with grille chicken and vodka sauce was VERY good but so freakin hot was impossible to eat for 20 minutes. Aside from the uneven food, a seven dollar charge to unscrew our(respectable white) and then not pour it at all was unacceptable. Our courses were served on top of each other with little spacing and neither of the management came to speak to us.... Probably because we were obviously not pleased with the experience. On top of all that the noise level was such I thought my head my pop off. Big hint: go eat at Il Puzziolla in Mt Lebanon to see how this should all be done."}
{"text":"This place is PHENOMENAL. We were driving across country from D.C. To San Diego and made a pit stop in Phoenix to have dinner here before the Suns vs Wiz game. The potato gnocchi was delicious, tender and plenty of sauce and mozzarella. We had a pizza halved between the red Diavlo and the white Tartufata, bon apetit! We sat outdoors which is somewhat secluded with the lit up treesand quiet chatter ambience. This place is a MUST! Erika was our waitress,she was superb!"}
{"text":"My wife and I traveled to Phoenix last week to spend Spring Break with my daughter who is attending ASU. During our visit we had the \"privilege\" of eating at Pizzeria Bianco Tuesday night... after a 2+ hour wait. My father had suggested we go eat there after seeing this place mentioned on one of his Food Network shows. I must say the atmosphere is decent, the service so so, and the pizza just OK. 

So, the next night I took my wife to a place I had eaten at last summer named Cibo which is just a few blocks away. After the first taste of her Siena pizza she turned to me and said \"this place blows away Bianco\"... she is right. 

When you are there you must try the Burrata appetizer. I had the pleasure of trying it last summer when it was just added to the menu and was glad to see it stuck around. I seriously doubt there is a pizza on the menu you will not like but that night we had the Diavola as well as the Siena mentioned above (both fabulous). Make sure to finish off the evening with some homemade Limoncello and you will gladly thank me later...

We got lucky enough to find a seat on the patio and were able to dine under a perfect Phoenix sky. Our server was named Melissa and she was great. She suggested the perfect wine for our meal and was very attentive the whole time we were there. 

We cannot wait to go again!!!"}
{"text":"Food was 3 stars.  The service was 0 stars due to Evon, our server, asking me after the meal was over why I only tipped her $5 for a $57.38 bill.  I gave her an extra $2 in cash but felt that she really did not deserve anything.  She was short with us and did not smile once.  We had 2 adults and 3 kiddos in our party.  She made us feel unwelcome and very uncomfortable.  James, another server, on the other hand was very friendly and even gave us a tip on a great ice-cream place to try out.  I gave an extra $2 for him.  I WILL NEVER EAT HEAR AGAIN AND WILL TELL ALL MY FRIENDS TO NOT COME HERE.  You make ok pizza in a quaint old house and I like your venue.  Please retrain you staff to not ask customers why they tip the way they do.  It is called a voluntarily gratuity for a reasons and I do not feel like I have to justify my tips and be interrogated.  VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.  i AM VERY SURPRISE FOR A PLACE AS NICE AS THIS.  We visited on Friday, April 12 at 12:57 PM I paid with my American Express card no. 233098. Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"4 stars for appearance 3 stars for food. It left me torn on whether to leave 3 stars or 4 stars but considering it's a restaurant and not a garden, I went with 3. 

Located in a small house inside of a beautiful courtyard area, you can enjoy the sounds of live music while paying a bit more than you should considering the quality of the food. 
Ordered a pizza and it was pretty \"meh\". Thin, not very tasty, and not crunchy even though you'd assume it would be considering how thin it was. Service was also pretty lackluster. My drink was empty for majority of the meal and I waited to use the restroom for a good 15 minutes because there was a waitress taking her break in there. If you're not a big fan of good food, go for the atmosphere. It's a cute little place. The valet was awesome since it's a pain to park in the area."}
{"text":"Tried about 4 different pizzas with my group and they were all delicious. Also tried a crepe with nutella which I highly recommend you save room for. Awesome outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Went to the fairgrounds and after the show we were hungry and anxious for a quiet spot to relax. Not knowing Phoenix well, my friend dubious asked where we should go. I suggested we Yelp it and showed her how to use Yelp.
She found this place and when I realized we were in the Willow district, I relaxed.
The ambiance couldn' t have been better. The waiter was friendly and helpful. The food was fresh, generous portions, and tasty. Lunch for two was less than $20 and there was plenty of off street parking too."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite pizza in my life is served here!
It's Tartufata: prosciutto + mushroom
When it gets to my table, I have to bathe in aromatic truffle steam. Instant food orgasm"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend, so we had high expectations. Very disappointed. We were told to ask for seating upstairs, because it was \"quieter \". NOT. All the diners were yelling to each other to be heard over the din from other diners yelling. The noise was deafening. 
The food was not great. My stuffed veal cutlet was dry, tough, greasy, and gave every sign of having been deep fried. My wife's half rotisserie chicken was dry, she had to ask for extra sauce. Our waiter seemed to abandon us halfway. Was not to be seen when we wanted our drinks refreshed. Not going back. Suggest adding some sound absorbing tiles or tapestries upstairs."}
{"text":"The staff was just as wonderful as the food!

We had to wait a bit for a table on a Saturday night, but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped by after a day of shopping and ordered the pizza! All I can say is it was outstanding! Great atmosphere! Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Great experience!! Food was 10/10 excellent and the half price pizza for happy hour is a must!! Host staff was pretty grumpy but once we got in and seated it was excellent!"}
{"text":"We started with the bruschetta..it was phenomenal!  We opted for the \"La Noce\" pizza.  Probably one of the best pizzas I have ever had.  Lastly, for dessert we had the banana nutella with ice cream. Delicious.  I will definitely be back more sooner than later!!  Oh yeah, did I mention that the atmosphere is adorable!  I cant wait for the weather to become nicer here in Phoenix so I can sit outside on their beautiful patio.  Cibo is my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Had read that Cibo had just reopened after a complete remodel and new chef (Jennifer Burfield - came from Cure) and menu.  So, glad we decided to try it last Saturday night.  Food was fantastic and service was warm and efficient.  Jennifer came out and spoke with us for a while and she was delightful.  The mussels with garlic, meyer lemon, white wine, fennel pollen, sumac, cream were some of the best I have had anywhere and you felt compelled to sop up the sauce with the grilled Tuscan bread.  The ravioli with a sage, butter, cream sauce was also fantastic, as was the red wine-balsamic braised beef with house made fettuccini.  BYOB with $5 corkage fee.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza in the valley. I lived in Rome for a month and the pizza at Cibo was better than most I had there. The wine selection here is also amazing- you can tell they really care about their selections. I just love how authentic this place is. Tutto bene! 

Seriously, I'd get married here if I could."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful experience. The food is authentic and delicious!  Service is fantastic. We've been twice and will absolutely be back. We actually ended up here after walking out of the Vig after the last bad experience we will have there. The menu is wonderful and such a beautiful patio. Try the calzone, it's amazing."}
{"text":"Cibo is by far my wife and I's favorite place in town.  The atmosphere is very warm and inviting, and the service has always been tremendous.  

My recommendation: If you only take one thing from this review, you must order the \"Burrata\" appetizer.  It's a creamy ball of mozzarella, drizzled with some balsamic vinegar, served with proscuitto and magnificent toasted bread.  

All of the pizzas we've ever ordered have been tremendous, and the dessert crepes with nutella are absolutely to die for.  You'll love this place!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!!!!!! This is the best pizza on Earth (we went back and forth for a while between Bianco and Cibo and we finally decided on Cibo)if you like fresh ,simple ingredients and great crust instead of salty ,over topped ,greasy chain restaurant pizzas. 
We have been going for years and between our friends we tried everything on the menu. I  keep having the margherita and it is amazing.The sauce is just right,the fresh mozzarella is to die for, the the fresh basil leaves on top and the crust send me in culinary haven.
The prices are good for the quality ingredients ,atmosphere and service.
This is the pizza you dream off and can't wait to go back!!
It is wonderful to see Phoenix developing its downtown area to satisfy some of our needs to  dine in more unique,quaint  and  urban settings."}
{"text":"Most amazing pizza and salads! This place rocks, the service is great, and the atmosphere is perfect."}
{"text":"My family is Italian and we have a lot of really epic cooks in the family. Because of that, I am very picky about eating Italian in restaurants. I find myself consistently disappointed, trying Italian restaurant after Italian restaurant in Calgary, and I am so happy to report that I have actually found a place that meets my high standards! Cibo has great service, great food and a great atmosphere. I love the family style dining, and the food never disappoints! 

The bruchetta, chicken liver and prosciutto scodellina are each fantastic. The gnocci is fabulous. The pizza is amazing - I love the prosciutto pizza and the pineapple pizza in particular. The dough is perfect and I'm a huge sucker for arugula on pizza! Yum! I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Well that was disappointing. The only thing Cibo did right was the pizza crust. Not exactly 100% Napolitano but it's somewhat there. My boyfriend and I ordered the Capricciosa pizza which involves \"prosciutto cotto\" or cooked ham. It does NOT mean \"deli lunch meat/boiled American ham\" which is what they topped the $16 pizza with. They need to invest in better quality ingredients and less in superficial ambiance and $300 painting. Not only is it low quality for the price, they forgot to season it! So bland and just really bad. As for the people who think their pizza is top notch, what is wrong with you? Take yourself to Italy or even New York and you'll realize how bad Cibo pizza is. #nevercomingback"}
{"text":"I hate to give this place a great review...It's already hard enough to get a table! But it is flawless. Honestly, I cannot think of one thing that I would change about the atmosphere, service or the food. The sandwiches at lunch are absolutely incredible, they actually bake the bread for each order, then assemble your sandwich (name one other restaurant that does that). I really try to give good feedback on Yelp, but this place is flawless.

That being said, don't go into it expecting it to be flawless- you're always disappointed when you do that (like an over-hyped movie). Expect it to be a solid \"8,\" and it will blow your mind. That's good advice that you can use in life ;-)"}
{"text":"So good!!! This joint and Harley's Bistro in midtown have the best pizza in the city!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Thursday evening and the place was packed. The special was lasagna. Since it was too dark for my 40 something eyes to read the menu that was what I had. Thank goodness I can't see well, because the lasagna was beef-a-rific! My dinner was delicious as was my colleagues' pizza of which I bummed a taste."}
{"text":"Food is great. Staff was unfriendly. Went to pick up a pizza, walked in had 4 staff members sit and talk to each other while I waited for someone to acknowledge me. I say loudly \"I am here for a pick up\" and I have to get the pizza box myself before someone comes over for me to pay."}
{"text":"Quaint and adorable. Great service and the food was good. Lots of great vegetarian options  which I am not but my friend is! This is a great place for a date night or a girl's night with wine, food & chit chat!"}
{"text":"The food was AWESOME, but the service was awful! Both my dad and I agree that we have never been treated so poorly by a waiter. The banana nutella crepes and pizza will keep me coming back though!"}
{"text":"I hear my friends brag about this place all the time, so I decided to check it out myself.
I am kind of disappointed, I expected more...
The pizza was alright, not much of toppings, and very little cheese, I felt like I was just eating dough.
Dessert on the other hand, Nutella crepes! Delicious!! 
Service, was alright, I don't think I even got our servers name...."}
{"text":"I am only in Phoenix for a few weeks and was hunting for something that would please the \"foodie\" in me.  (If traveling by public transportation), don't be discouraged by the slightly awkward walk from the light rail station (Van Buren) to the restaurant (5th and Fillmore).  Cibo sits right on the corner and is built into an old house.  Visually pleasing -- lowlight, original artwork -- I liked the ambience.  It was refreshing to get away from the contemporary desolation that is downtown Phoenix.  Granted, my friend and I dined on July 4th (a quiet night for many restaurants), but the service was wonderful.  Our server struck up conversation and seemed genuine in recommending her favorite antipasti, pizza and wine/beer combinations.  The antipasto speciale was full of interesting flavors and the Prosciutto Crudo pizza was simple yet tasty.  Great dough and black label meat is always a plus.  I stand for beer with pizza so the server pointed me to a micro brew that's right out of Tuscon (forget the name, but second of the four).  Since it was a mellow night, we were allowed to lounge outside on the patio with the Nutella and strawberries.  I probably could have gone without dessert (considering I had a few slices to take home), but my sweet tooth said otherwise.  Overall a really pleasant and peaceful experience.  I also appreciated the server's comment that contrary to popular belief, Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco are not rivals.  Rather, they endorse each other in front of guests."}
{"text":"We had a reservation and upon  arriving, we were seated upstairs at a bar table next to the washroom.  Every other table was empty and we asked for another table, we were told they were all reserved??  We asked, what is the difference between our reservation and the other reservations and we were told that the \"computer\" assigns tables and it was not possible to move...simply bizarre.  Ultimately, the manager was consulted and they found us a table outside, which was pleasant.

The food was mediocre.  The Meatballs were somewhat bland and the Ricotta with marmalade was simply that (I could have made this at home in 30 seconds).  The small quantity of polenta fries made the dish way over priced.  The ribs were slightly above average but still lacked he punch.  Overall, the flavors were fairly bland making the overall experience less than satisfactory

Overall we were definitely unimpressed.  There are so many other options, I am surprised Cibo is so complacent.

Maybe we should have tried a pizza."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, and service. It was my first time there and I will definitely be back. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Di Notte - fontina, pecorino, gorgonzola, mozzarella and spicy salame  

One of my top 5 pizzas of all time...and I've had it many times...doesn't dissapoint."}
{"text":"I'm not understanding the recent rash of lackluster reviews. CiBo is consistently awesome, tasty and efficient. Better than  Bianco without the three hour wait. Adorable setting, great staff and beautifully community minded, holding yearly fundraising events for local charities. CiBo is the real deal, and if you folks who left bad reviews don't come back? More pizza for me!

Ps- zeppoli? Heck yes."}
{"text":"The food is SO good but I literally ALWAYS get awful service! I complained to management for the awful and rude server we had, they respond and apologize and also offered to comp our next meal but it just has not become worth it to me considering there are plenty of other GREAT pizza places around town that also have awesome and friendly service."}
{"text":"This was our first time in this Pizzeria Cafe. Everything was just awesome. U need to try each n every Pizza over there. Unique taste. But my desert stole the show . Crepe Nutella with Vanilla ICeCrEaM just WOW."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last two weeks. Amazing food and great service. The ricotta tapa is a must try. I went back a second time just for that. Pizza's pretty good too. And this was the first place in the city where I found the Granville Island Winter Ale on tap this season. This place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"We have been countless times for but lunch and dinner and have always had a wonderful experience.  The food, ambiance, and staff are incredible.  Actually, the pizza is the best I've ever had.  The Margarita is a tried and true but my new favorite is the \"La Noce\"."}
{"text":"Great brunch/lunch specials... I may just drop in right now to enjoy another awesome sandwich. Their caprese, IMHO, is superior to Pane Bianco, and a better buy! Yum yum"}
{"text":"Ok, went back last night, felt terrible because we were the late nighters, and everything was perfect. The pizza, the salads and the wine were all so nicely done. And what finally brought me to five stars was the crepe with Nuteila and Mascarpone. OMG awesome. I am now craving it the day after. Fully beats out the crepe with nutella and banana that I also adore..."}
{"text":"Excellent wood-fired pizza in a cozy (crowded) setting that used to be a house. Have some time to spend, but worthwhile if you do."}
{"text":"Been to Cibo many times! Beautiful historic house, consistently great service, best pizza in the Valley. We have long-debated whether Cibo surpassed Bianco, but I no longer question that it does. Cibo is best, and reasonably priced and delicious. The burrata is also the best I have ever had, and I highly recommend it. It is extremely creamy, but holds together very well, and the balsamic drizzled across the top is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Great spot for some outdoor dining. Whatever else you do, make sure you order the burrata appetizer at Cibo. Just order it. Go. Hurry."}
{"text":"What more could you want - yummy food, cozy atmosphere & friendly service! Cibo is a great option for lunch with a large variety of salads, sandwiches both hot and cold variety's, dinner with delicious pizzas and salads and who could forget their amazing deserts. I'm a big fan of Nutella and Cibo knows how to do it right...enter Banana Nutella Crepe. I honestly thought I had died and gone to heaven! Okay, I'm slightly obsessed with Nutella but can you blame me? Cibo makes a mean pizza pie too. Give it go and you're sure to leave with a smile!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza! It had a great selection of pizzas and appetizers. We would love to try their pasta nights sometime soon! Food came out fast, and the place was clean. Love the ambiance of the place and that it is a converted historic home in downtoan Phoenix. Definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"3 stars for food and ambience.  Minus 1 star for service.

Cibo is the average answer to Pizzeria Bianco.  I can't believe they've even been compared  - the only similarity I can think of is geography.  The crusts are worlds apart - at least on the night we went. 

We chose to take some out of town guests to Cibo last night because of:
(1) all the praises we read on Yelp and other media
(2) the fact that it's one of the few well-regarded independent places open on a Monday night
(3) it looked cute from the outside

Apparently, other people thought the same.  All the tables for four were full inside so we took a table in the patio, which turned out to be a blessing because we got lots of privacy to talk.  

The downside though was getting the attention of the waiter.  Ice water was poured and menus were handed out as soon as we sat down but the waiter appeared over 15 min later.  When we ordered a refill on a glass of wine after the appetizer, he came with it almost at the end of our meal.

We order the antipasto speciale, large ($17) to share.  The plate was huge:  generous slices of prosciutto, 3 slices of bresaola with shaved pecorino on arugula, 4 slices of grilled zucchini,  mounds of balsamic pearl onions, giant olives, grilled red peppers with capers and parmesan, and cherry tomatoes with bocconcini and basil.

Pizzas are split between Rosse (red) and Bianche (white).  On the waiter's recommendation, we ordered these: 
- Red: Diavola (tomato sauce, mozz and spicy salame)  $13
- White: Siena (grilled zucchini, mozz, speck (smoked proscuitto) and pecorino)  $14

VERDICT: Cibo vs Pizzeria Bianco

The toppings were generous and tasty but the major complaint we had was the CRUST.  Pizza's all about the crust.  This was more like charred bread - it was not crusty in the least bit.  The dough had a nice chew to it but no crunch whatsoever.  

Chris Bianco's dough is so brilliant because there's an awesome contrast between the crusty exterior and the pillowy interior.  Chris' crust is so thin that you can inhale slice after slice but here we had trouble eating more than 2 slices.  

Even though this pizza was baked in a brick oven, there was no smokiness to it - almost as if it was flash-baked.  Pizzeria Bianco's crust not only has texture but a complex-flavored interior and smoky exterior.  Eating pizza will never be the same again...

WINNER:  Pizzeria Bianco"}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant with great outdoor seating. I am addicted to the meatball sandwich!"}
{"text":"This place both blows and sucks,  The antipasto appetizer is mostly grilled zucchini.  The pizza is thin crust like a quesadilla (at three times the price).  The service is horrible.  And they close at 10:00PM.  I'd rather microwave something at home than put up with this bullshit..."}
{"text":"had a meal for eight of us on a tuesday eve service was great' food was fantastic price was reasonable will go again"}
{"text":"Friday 6 PM.
Table of 2.
You will never run short on water as they give you a bottle on your table and promptly replace it when its out.

I got banana nutella crepes.
Additional: Vanilla ice cream ($2) and whipped cream ($2).
I wasn't told about the additional charges till the bill was presented. Surprised bunny.
$7 for the crepe, $2 for ice cream, and $2 more for whipped cream. Total 11 USD before tax and tip.

Food came out kind of slow, but it was a busy friday night.


The pizza \"Latina\" was okay,... I had better. All the toppings fell right off, including the cheese.
The crust was puffy and airy, and the center was extremely thin.

The server was tall handsome lanky and friendly.

The venue was loud alive, lots of ppl, had a lot of flies too, even indoors.

I liked how the windows opened to let outside air in.

It looks like a house was converted into a restaurant. The red bricks are charming.
The lawn/garden /patio is welcoming.
I liked the art on the walls. 

There's only one walk-in bathroom for both genders.

Its a nice little oasis from the hustle and bustle of downtown.

Perhaps I'll return for the crepes in the future if I happen to be in that side of town."}
{"text":"I've been here three times. I would say this place has the best atmosphere for early Friday evening. The best seats are outside during the springtime and if you could get the inside, it would also give the great view of the Phoenix downtown. The pizza here is made hand tossed and thin crust. Some of you may know that there is competitor near this pizza restaurant. Honestly I would choose this place over Pizzeria B.... because of the wait time there. 

In addition to Pizza, this restaurant offers variety of wine selections and locally brewed beer. If you were not driving, I would highly recommend some of the wine; it matches well with pizza! Also, the crepe here is amazing mainly because of the fresh cheese that they use to make it. IF you are fan of live music, they play sweet guitar/key board smooth jazz on Friday night at outside patio. Check this place out and let me know if you visit!"}
{"text":"After being told there was a six hour wait at the ever popular Pizzeria Bianco in downtown Phoenix where I was planning to celebrate my birthday with a few friends last week, I remembered another wonderful place and off we went.

Cibo is in a converted 1940ish bungalow and has a yard full of beautiful trees woven with tiny lights. We got a table under a canopy of a few trees and shared four different pizzas that we chose by popular vote. I have to say that it was a hard decision since they all sounded pretty amazing. We agreed that the Diavolo was our favorite. And it didn't hurt that they had a nice wine list including Orvieto Classico which always reminds me of a favorite trip to Italy and a Salice Salintino that I always liked to share with a couple of my best friends back in my New York days. For dessert? Crepes of the Nutella and Suzette variety that we passed around."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great service and fair prices. We got the flatbread and half portions of the linguine and ravioli. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Wonderful outdoor patio and delicious pizzas. Perfect date location."}
{"text":"If you have not visited Cibo yet...it's just because you must not know about this fabulous restaurant.  Last Saturday night I enjoyed an awesome dinner with my husband and a friend who had not yet been to Cibo.  We arrived at the restaurant for an 8:00 reservation and were warmly greeted by the host and immediately taken to our table. Perfect! Our waiter was there promptly, offering to open our wine and asking whether we would like water, and offering several options.  Cibo is BYOB, which we love, considering the mark up on wines in restaurants!  There is a corkage fee, which I feel is  absolutely necessary.  They have to have the proper tools, proper glasses, as well as take into account the labor it takes to clean them and replace breakage. For those who complain about that, well, obviously YOU don't own a business and don't understand that the service a restaurant provides DOES cost something!!  I read some comments about this charge, and had to comment about those uninformed remarks.  (Hello...Evan M and Becky Z!!.!!). Considering that if they had a liquor license, your $15 bottle of wine would likely cost you $35, this is a bargain!! I say this to the complainers: Stay home! There is NO corkage charge there!! 

We started with an appetizer of mussels with a yummy, creamy sauce that was so fantastic I am still thinking about it!! We love mussels and try them everywhere, but these were seriously some of the best, if not THE best I have ever had.  Better than Pointe Brugge, which was a real surprise! Cibo seerves really great bread with dipping oil, which we all dunked into this amazing sauce...Soooo goood!!!  I had a grilled shrimp dish over risotto garnished with pesto sauce on the side  that was outstanding.  My husband had the bolagnaise meat sauce over pasta, and he was really impressed...a great rating from a guy whose meatballs are literally award-winning, who makes his grandmother's sauce and home made pasta on a regular basis. My friend had the pesce de las mar, fantastic fresh pasta with an abundance of fresh seafood that she said was outstanding. We all felt like something sweet and shared a fantastic piece of cheesecake...dense,delicious and  topped with fresh berries.  Had coffe with it that was just so good you wanted more of it.  What a lovely, wonderful meal after a really long week of house hunting! Our service was friendly, efficient and tailored to us.  He made a fabulous meal just...better! Great waiter and great host, there to cater to our needs without hovering.Really amazing and damn near impossible to find in Pittsburgh!! Bravo to Cibo!!! We WILL be back!!
all for reservations.  You will LOVE this great spot in Regent Square.

If you are looking for an intimate atmosphere, great service and outstanding food, check out Cibo. Once youo've gone, you'll become a regular!!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was wonderful!  Neat old house with a beautiful shaded courtyard in the front. Live acoustic music played at a nice background level. Attentive, gracious wait staff. The portions are plentiful and delicious. I ordered the Calzone- enough for dinner and lunch tomorrow too. My son was able to finish his Pappardelle Bolognese but hubby has leftovers for tomorrow too. We split the Fresca dessert 3 ways-more than enough for all of us. And very reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"I went to Cibo for the first time tonight and it was a very pleasant evening.

The restaurant was fairly busy for a Sunday night and we were seated at the communal table as we didn't have a reservation.

We had the olives and bruschetta to start. The olives were ok but there were a few wrinkled ones which I didn't like. I'm not sure if they were meant I be like this or just old. The bruschetta was very tasty, less tomato than I am used to and more artichoke hearts, but an interesting take non the less. I will say that the serving size was fairly small so I would probably avoid them next time.

For my main I had the Farfella pasta. It was delicious and I highly recommend it. The portion size was also very good for the price.

For dessert I shared the Dark Chocolate Date Bodini. The salted caramel sauce was very good and the cake was moist and flavourful.

I was also pleased with the price of the beer. ($4.75)

Overall the food was very good and the prices were reasonable, I can definitely see myself visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!  Came here for pizza and a mimosa on a Sunday afternoon and had a really great experience.  We sat on the patio and it was georgous - great atmosphere and very good food.  Would love to go back to see what it's like indoors and try something different."}
{"text":"I hate to be critical, but really this restaurant needs to step it up. There are so many excellent urban pizzerias in the Phoenix area and this one fails in comparison. Our server was quite friendly and prompt, however it was hard to keep track of the service because we were so busy swatting flies off of our indoor table.  We ordered what the server recommended and the pizzas arrived within five minutes. The flavors were bland and the crust was soggy and wet-so much so that we did not finish our order and definitely did not take any leftovers home.  We were looking forward to advertised interesting flavor combinations and pizza that would keep is coming back. Although the decor was trendy and the patio seems accommodating and cozy, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza.  I enjoyed the Genova (at least I am pretty sure that is the name of the pie) and it was wonderful... totally different, it had pesto, with potato and onion... Excellent.  Overall the experience was great, we visited on a Saturday night and it was very loud in the restaurant, especially because the walls are all stone and there is zero sound absorption... so it was near impossible to hear the people of my party.  Overall I would go back."}
{"text":"Hello..
 We eat here at least once a week. We enjoy their pizza and brunch. Specific items only, as this place can be over priced. There is a server named Tom who is severely lacking the \"service industry\" bone... He is by far the worst server there. He has ruined several of our experiences. To the point that we specifically request to not be seated in his area. When we complained about him we were told that he is apart of the owners family. Despite the many complaints he is still in the front of the house. So sad. His communication skills are more suited for the computer world.
Today is mother's day and I brought my family there to eat. The food was cold and we were surrounded by flies inside of the restaurant. Horrible first time experience for my family. We keep trying to give cibo the benefit of the doubt but we are running low on chances as of now. 
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer. The service and quality of food is not consistent."}
{"text":"This is a quaint spot, which undoubtedly was once someone's residence. You try to figure out which room is which as you walk in, picturing a TV or a sofa in the corner. You feel like you are having dinner and your buddy's house with his folks preparing a meal. We showed up for a late lunch, no wait or crowd. Pizza was fabulous. Nice texture to the crust, a little floppy so using a fork isn't out of the question. My son had the crepe, which looked amazing and tasted just as good. I would imagine parking could be beastly during a rush, since you are in a neighborhood, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"CIBO is our favorite stop when we're going to be downtown. Have been several times, never had anything that wasn't great. Originally went after reading a food review that recommended the Tartufata pizza: mushrooms and white truffle oil - you've got to go at least once to try that one; it's amazing."}
{"text":"I first went here with my husband on Valentine's Day 3 years ago.  That was my husband's FAVORITE meal ever there, and he hasn't been pleased since unfortunately.

I wish that at lunch I could get broiled shrimp on my salad, and then I'd be here as often as I can.  I love the salads and the atmosphere.  It should be open later so we can go after the symphony and have a lovely crepe dessert and adult beverage."}
{"text":"Overall, our experience here was great! The food was absolutely perfect. No complaints. The place was busy and the wait staff was a bit preoccupied, so our check took a bit longer to come. Also, valet was pretty much the only way to park because the street parking was full for blocks. Music? It was amazing. The background music sounded a lot like 70's girl pop from Italy and psychedelic jam bands from the 60's-70's. 'd it!"}
{"text":"The food was soooo good. We got a pizza and a sandwich. The pizza was so delicious I ate almost the whole thing myself. After that we got a crape with nutela. This is a must get. Definitely going here again."}
{"text":"Found this gem on yelp after a long drive from tombstone to Sedona. We were exhausted and hungry. The service was great and the food even better! Mangia!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza! Authentic flavors straight from Italy!"}
{"text":"Hands down the most delicious prosciutto sandwich I've ever had!  I came here for lunch and had the most delicious meal ever!  
They make their bread and it's so light and crispy- so worth the $$$ and trip!  My meal was about $9 for lunch.

Staff was friendly and quick.  They even have valet for your car!  This place is a house turned into a restaurant.  Very clean and I would 100% recommend this place!  Can't wait to come back!!!!!  Might be my go to Friday lunch spot!  

You won't be disappointed you came!"}
{"text":"I went to Cibo the day after my birthday (which was a Friday) with friends and had an awesome experience! We had reservations for 7:45 and although we were 20 minutes late our reservations were held. We were seated upstairs where it was quite noisy and busy but my friends and I were still able to talk and have fun. Our waiter handled everything quite excellently considering how busy it was, and he was so kind as to give us our wine for half off because of my birthday! Even when we complicatedly asked for all separate bills he handled the situation very well! We started with two orders of bruschetta (which I do not recommend because they are TINY considering they're $6) and we all had pizzas, which were great and about 8 inches/personal sized. The only downsides to the restaurant were the noise and the fact that they were out of the first two wines we chose. Otherwise, I had a great time and I was very impressed with the food and service at Cibo!"}
{"text":"Best PIZZA in town.  I love the olives and cheese pizza. I like my pizza a little burnt and they hook it up that way.  I take one pizza down on my own.

The desert is YUM.  GET THE FRESCA....

Price is also easy to swallow.  Pretty neat little spot for the family or a date."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about Cibo and finally decided to try it. Luckily all of the good things were true! The food was great, only \"complaint\" I had is that the cheese and toppings fell off as soon as you lifted a slice, but it tasted great!

The atmosphere is so cozy, inviting, and romantic. Great place for a date, or even just with friends or family. Definitely recommend the vegetarian pizza, and the Nutella banana crepes are to die for!"}
{"text":"Just ate at Cibo for lunch. Delicious. The only reason I didn't give a 5-star was the fact that pizza wasn't on the menu for lunch. But when one door closes another opens. The food was top-notch and satisfying. Needless to say, I will be going back for dinner soon to to get the rating to a 5-star."}
{"text":"Best authentic Italian style pizza in town! Absolutley love the food. Long wait, but well worth it. Go knowing you are going to spend some time waiting and grab a drink. You wont regret it!"}
{"text":"I and my 4 friends were not impressed with this place.  The pizza isn't what we feel is great pizza.  Go to La Grande Orange, Pizzaria Bianco, or Cafepino."}
{"text":"Let me just say that I love the atmosphere here, the outside tables, the twinkle-lights, the guy playing requests on keyboard. I spent a good long night here a couple weeks ago and had a great time. I enjoyed the pizza and the beer. There were a couple problems though. Never got offered a glass for my beer, service was slow like Monday mornings...

But I do love the neighborhood...so much so I decided to move down there :)"}
{"text":"I had my 89-year-old mother and 22-year-old niece with me for dinner last night and I took them to CIBO.  We had an excellent time.  The food was fantastic, the staff friendly and efficient, and the environment (a bungalow-style house) was charming.  
We had another engagement so we ate early and were able to be seated immediately.  I'm told the restaurant is very busy at a later time.  We ate indoors, although the patio looked inviting as it was quiet and had misters.  
My party shared the bruschetta appetizer (two each of three different kinds, one better than the next), a pizza, and the house salad.  All were delicious.  My niece opted for dessert and chose the Nutella and marscapone crepe with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.  (She can do that ... she's still young.)  Mom and I each had a bite and pronounced it heavenly.  I can't speak to the beverages as we just had water (which needed to be filtered).  
The meal wasn't inexpensive but most restaurants in that area are pricey (if they even serve dinner, as that is an office neighborhood with many places serving breakfast & lunch only). 
I will definitely return as my sole complaint was with the complimentary H2O.  The next time I'll pay for bottled water."}
{"text":"Okay, the only reason I'm not giving this place a complete 5 star is because of the I'm too good to be serving you waitress we got... I think she forgot she makes tips for a living or maybe she is rich and just works for the hell of it... either way, the food is fantastic and if you can avoid the brown hair girl medium length-  tall girl, your experience should be fantastic... love the way is all set up."}
{"text":"Great vibe at the restaurant and excellent service.  My friends and I had a flight to catch and asked the waitress to expedite our order.  Food was out very quick and we were done with our dinner with time to spare.  Food was good also.  Loved their thin crust pizzas!"}
{"text":"Even after reading other Yelper's not so glowing reviews, I still wanted to try Cibo for myself. I went with 3 other friends on a Saturday with no reservations, and other than a space cadet look from our hostess before she disappeared for a couple minutes,  she came back to inform us that she had a table available.
As mentioned, the decor is nice... its a very big space, and there is a patio during summer hours.
I like how you can have a few bites and drinks, or a full meal. 
We had 5 starters to share for $18. The lamb meats balls were decent, not oo gamey tasting, the shrimp were perfectly cooked and had a fresh arugula salad with melon. As for the broccolini/boccocini/cured lemon..it was bland, and a bit rubbery.
We had the steak and a couple pizzas for our main. 
The steak was cooked medium and tender. It had a beautiful salad with heirloom tomatos and a strong parmesan cheese on the side. The portion was exactly right for 4 people. The mushroom pizza was amaaazing. We were told there was a bit of cinammon blended in with the cheese, which gave it a slightly sweet taste.The veg pizza was nice as well. Both a little thick on the crust for a thin crust pizza, but the crust is my favourite part, so no complaints on my end. 
They ( like I think everyone now) carry Phil and Sebastian coffee, so along with the panacotta, which I give 3 thumbs up as it was a delicious lemony cloud of smooth creaminess, we had a coffee. It complimented it well, as it wasnt too strong for an after dinner beverage. 
OUR SERVER: I was pleasantly suprised, our server  had GASP..personality,something that is lacking in waiting staff now days. He gave us some great recommendations on food and wine and had great product knowledge of the menu (considering they are such a new restaurant.)"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in the downtown phoenix area... Don't be tempted to eat too much for dinner since you will want lots and lots of room for the amazing crepe desert, go ahead get strawberry and banana .. You will not regret it!  
Perfect date place as well, so cute and adorable..."}
{"text":"SIX STARS!

This is by FAR the best place I have ever experienced. Everything about it is great. The Vegetariana Pizza is a fun adventure for a couple.. and the crepes for desert are to DIE for! Vanilla ice cream, fresh strawberries, kiwi and peaches with some whipped cream in a crepe! WOWzer this place is so fun and I just love it."}
{"text":"Great appetizers and wine selection. Pizza was so so, a bit on the bland side. Fun and charming atmosphere. Great place to grab an appetizer/drinks and catch up with friends. Get there early. We went on a Saturday night and had to wait about 40 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"Spicy pep pep pizza, nutella crepe with ice cream and banana or strawberry, glass of wine, get you right in the head in the '97 sucker. Cannot vouch for anything else on their menu."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place?! The food is delicious and the atmosphere is charming! 

I highly recommend the Omero Salad and the La Noce and Rustica pizza's!

On a side note, there's always been great debate among my friends as to how the name is pronounced. I went to the website tonight before I wrote this review and found the answer we've all wondering Cibo is pronounced \"CHEE-boh\"! 

Enjoy your visit!"}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty tasty.  Solid thin crust italian style pie.  If i'm nitpicking they are pretty stingy on the toppings and I wish they were a dollar or two cheaper.

Biggest complaint here is the building itself.  If you get stuck inside one of those tiny little rooms that were built originally as someone's bedroom with like 7 tables be prepared to hear everyone's conversation but your own.

Ask for the crushed red pepper infused olive oil - it is glorious. Dump the crushed red pepper on that spicy sausage.  Heat lovers dream."}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat here based on reviews. Not sure if it was an off day but I will never go back. My server seemed mad I came in. Like I reminded him of someone he doesn't like....then we order etc etc. I get the charcuterie plate, 3 meats, 3 cheeses, 3 fruits. It came out with 4 meats (which was nice) but only 2 cheeses (1 which was a caprese salad with no basil), 2nd was the goat cheese like on the menu, and for the 3d cheese...they threw on the pear salad...but with no pears. Then the fruits! I got 3 slices of apple. Instead of 3 separate fruits, it was 3 apple slices. Instead of fruit, they sent out grilled veggies??? No. Not cool. I asked the lady for some fruit she came out with the kids fruit plate.  ok thats fine. I like my fruit cut up for that anyway .my kids didn't like the pasta (red sauce and plain) not sure how that got messed up but it was really bland.  Anyways...then when I got the check I got charged for the fruit plate. Ok out of an $80 check, what's $3? But still...I don't feel like I should pay $3 for something that should've been on the $20 plate. When I asked the waiter, instead of apologizing he got super pissy and turned around (like a diva) and said \"ok I'll take it off\" like not even being I'm any way caring that he gets tips. So then him and some other girl were talking about what shouldve been on the plate (I was proven right) then be rudely came back with the check and kind of tossed it in front of me and said \"thanks\". Thanks but no thanks guy, you totally ruined my whole cibo experience. I think I'll stick with the always gracious Pomo Pizzeria on 1st ave...BUT on the bright side, my daughters did like the margherita pizza and the pear salad was really good. I just had a messed up order and horrendous service."}
{"text":"I had the Capricciosa Pizza. It was amazing!!! It's definitely all about the crust.  The fact that this place is an old house only adds to the total experience of enjoying this delicious food!!!"}
{"text":"My first time here and it was great. Outdoor seating made the experience better. Grab a glass of wine and sit by the fireplace while you wait. A short 30 minutes on a Saturday night and we where gazing upon the menu. Attentive wait staff and quick with the appetizers. 
Pizza crust was crispy on outside and soft on inside. Fresh ingredients made my food hole want more. Try the Rustica pizza with basil. I find Cibo to be comparable to LGO and Bianco, but without the ridiculous wait you find at Bianco. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Delicious, great environment, would definitely go back!   We got the \"capricciosa\" pizza, salad, and a really yummy dessert that consisted of nice little fried dough balls and Nutella.  Mmmm!  The house is beautiful as well, so much more character here than out in the 'burbs!"}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the long wait and wobbly tables, I'd give this place 5 stars. The staff are quick, friendly, and get your orders right. Their tea is absolutely delicious (and I don't even like iced tea). The complimentary valet is awesome too! I come back for their omero salad, margherita pizza, and last but absolutely not least their crepes. Holy smokes are they good! Your bill will be no less than $60 for 2 but it is most definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! This little gem is hidden away just outside downtown phoenix! It is a small little restaurant being run out of what looks like it used to be a small house. They menu offers a variety of flavor combinations that one would never think of when cooking at home.

The service staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. They have great suggestions and offer explanations of the ingredients in English. 

The moscato de asti is WONDERFUL. It is so sweet and goes so well with any meal. It is very reasonably priced and is more cost efficient when ordered by the bottle.

Be adventurous, try something new, DONT ASK FOR RANCH and make sure you order the nutella and banana crepe for dessert!"}
{"text":"You sandbaggin' son of a bitch! What do you like better, Christmas or Cibo? (Mr. Grey?) Yes. The answer would be, um, Cibo? 

Wowie. Cibo. Where to start? How about the name? Cibo: means food in Italian. Yeah! Who knew?! And food do they have my friend. Jump on board the party bus cause we are heading to Filmore and 5Th! To Cibo-land! 

What's that you say? Pizza? Wait, you want the best pizza in Arizona? But with class? With taste? With, what? ATMOSPHERE? Oh damn. Have I got the place for you. Not only is their wine selection to die for, but if you have never had the pleasure of tasting a fine Limoncello, than saddle up partner: because Cibo is your destination of choice! Their Limoncello and Chococello are like nothing on this continent. I would say that they give Naples a run for their money. Shit, they give your Italian Grandmother a run for her money!

When you go here, try the 4 cheese pizza. If you love cheese, this is for you. There is a kick there, that will have your mouth watering for more! And their crepes, please. No comparison anywhere in town. 

I heart Cibo. This is my restaurant of choice in Arizona. When friends or family come to visit I bring them here. Hot date with my man? Cibo! My birthday? Cibo! My dog died? Cibo! .... you get the idea.

Romantic, fun, girls night out, boys night out, family night out, work night, school night, hot night, cool night. It's raining men night and so on. Cibo!"}
{"text":"Had the stew and fry bread today ...both were way too greasy!!!  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  They need to go to Cameron (AZ) Trading Post or even a Diamondbacks Spring Training Game to learn how to make good fry bread and need to drain the grease off the meat when they cook it to make stew.  Very poor quality!"}
{"text":"We 100% loved our dinner at Cibo. The pizzas were fantastic, and the limoncello was to die for. And while the recommended appetizer was pretty bland (risotto and mozzarella balls), everything else was just delicious. I would go back there for dinner in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Not quite Bianco.  Flavor is ever so slightly blander.  But damn good wood-fired happiness.  Nice ambience.  Can't go wrong sitting outside in nice weather.  Wait is usually brief for small parties.  Salads are great.  Bread is great.  Food is great.  Very, very good crust.  This place is a must.  4.5 stars."}
{"text":"I am a pizza lover!  I could eat pizza every day for lunch and for dinner!  This is one of my favorite pizza places in town!  I bring all out of town guests here and frequent the place as often as I can. 

I always get the capriccoisa pizza (not sure if I spelled that right), but it has olives, proscuitto and mushrooms!  

AND I always get a crepe for dessert!  My personal favorite is strawberry and nutella.  To die for!"}
{"text":"I've only written a few reviews, but I just noticed that this is the third that is a pizzeria.  However, I don't even really eat that much pizza.  For some reason, the people that own these little gem pizzerias know how to really create a wonderful atmosphere and diversify their menus enough to reel me in and keep me coming back for more.  I've been here several times with my best friend.  This place is wonderful.  Great food, good wine and a wonderful staff.  I love outdoor settings.  There are plenty of tables to sit outside in a neighborhood setting.  LOVE THAT!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Had mozzarella cheese with fresh tomatoes and also the margarita pizza and it was perfectly made nice outdoor patio to sit down highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We moved to Pittsburgh from Orlando 3 years ago and slowly have been trying a variety of restaurants to find our favorite go to.  I think that CIBO has hit the mark.  We went to the original one and loved it and waited for the new restaurant to open and it is even better.  Last night we shared the beet pear and arugula salad and the crab beignets.  Both were delicious.  There are 5 beignets and easily shared with two or more people.  They were light fluffy and the crab tasted so good.  The salad was light and fresh.  It was small but also easily shared.
I hate when you are given huge salads before dinner and this was just right.  We then had
the flank steak and the pasta with mushrooms and blue cheese.  Both were delicious.  The service was perfect and BYOB was appreciated.  Prices were good and location in Regent Square had fairly good  parking.  BTW, we had dinner night before at AvenueB and CIBO's
meal was the better!"}
{"text":"Ate here last night while visiting Phoenix..   I would highly recommend this restaurant.   Gourmet Pizza's, unique appetizers, full bar...

Great outdoor seating area...

Cibo makes one of the best crusts I've had...


Go here if you're in town..."}
{"text":"This is the BEST date place and just going out with friends place!! Food is yummo and the employees ROCK! I go as often as I'm able to get there."}
{"text":"CIBO on 17th Ave has an extraordinary pizza bar and uber friendly attentive staff that makes you feel like you just stepped into a backyard party with unbelievably casual yet chic gourmet food. Always consistently top quality pizza with a heavenly crust that easily becomes my top addiction when dipped into that top secret caper garlic sauce dip that is Screaming MORE! MORE! And the staff to boot is incredibly customer service oriented, going out of their way to indulge any sweet/salty cravings you may have - and also treat you to tastings of the next up and coming experimental pizza in the works. How much do I simply LOVE CIBO? Well, dear, let me count the many pizza creations I've enjoyed and come back for over and over again...Just ask for the pizza maestros behind the bar --Kevin, Chance, Damien and Paul!!!"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a higher score, but I'm torn because while I have been here a great many times, and often bring visiting friends and family, I was pretty peeved at the service last Friday night 6-12-2015. 

I genuinely got the feeling that the management had taken the night off, and the inmates were running the asylum because despite the fact that the place was somewhat empty by the time we got there, late in the evening, the front-of-house staff was out-to-lunch so to speak.

The place was really noisy despite being half empty. The water they brought was warm as were the three glasses they brought. We also had to push pushes to the adjoining empty table because the staff wasn't removing them.

One thing they don't put on the menu is that if you opt to order a Coca-Cola vs. say some beer, etc., the soda comes in a can (which had a weird smell to it), and at $2 for a can and a warm glass, it's a pretty extreme 10x markup.

Food-wise, the pizza to get remains the tricolore.

We tried the arancini as an appetizer, and it lacked seasoning. The server brought a small tin of marina, which wasn't enough for the 4 balls, and when we asked for more, they failed to bring more. In the end, we didn't finish the appetizer because the balls got cold.

My father got the bolognese, which I didn't try, though he said mine had more flavor. 
I'd really like to try the other pasta dish sometime, as it looks quite good.

It would seem this restaurant has seen better days, but I'm not sure. If they make some small changes in the kitchen and retrain the wait staff, it might be worth visiting again."}
{"text":"Artisan pizza, salad, wine .....end with a little dessert and coffee.......ohh what could be better??
This place has been one of my favs for YEARS  and it continues to keep on meeting ( exceeding?) my expectations! 

It is a bit pricey, but it doesn't stop us! it's always packed!! 

You have definitely got to go here, I really think you'll enjoy the whole experience!!

  Best pizza... Artisan not NY or Chicago style.....just sayin!"}
{"text":"Mr. B and I LOVE LOVE LOVE pizza! Good pizza that is. If it were up to us, we'd have pizza at least 5 out of the 7 nights of the week. The building setting is a house turned into an eating establishment. The service was good and the food was GREAT! In reality, 2 people can share a pizza and large salad and be good. Mr. B and are selfish and greedy so, sharing was not an option on the pizza situation; we did share the salad. The bill was a little hefty for 2 pizzas, a large salad and 3 glasses of vino but, you can't put a price on good food and service. The servers were extremely attentive, which was a huge plus. We will definitely be back for date night. Definitely a must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch. We sat on the patio since it's somewhat nice weather for Phoenix. It's sprinkling!!
The waiter was a bit abrupt (unexpected) but polite. He seemed in a hurry, but it was empty. Who knows!
We ordered sandwiches and were tasty. The house salad was very good. 
Will be back in the evening sometime."}
{"text":"Me and my wife went to this restaurant for Valentine's Day. I ordered linguini while she ordered cioppino. Both pasta were tough and rubbery, I've had better pasta at Olive Garden. Overall did not exceed expectations and was a total disappointment. Will absolutely not be coming back"}
{"text":"Appetizers - Good!
Wine - Even Better!
Pizza - Amazing! 
Dessert - Banana Thing with Nutella on it! Whooop! Slam dunk on a perfect meal with my cousin and her two teenage sons with appetites unbelievable! 
With only these few hours available to spend with my relatives, it was spent at Cibo, nothing could have been better time spent with relatives, outside on a cool fall night of last year! Yep, experience was that memorable that I thought I should yelp about it!"}
{"text":"If someone tells you there just isn't good pizza in Phoenix, you can tell them they aren't looking hard enough. Tucked away in what seems to be a residential neighborhood, Cibo transforms its early 1900's bungalow into a legitimate contender for the best pizzeria in town. If you're looking for great pizza and a great ambience for date night, your search ends here.

The pizza itself is heavily Neapolitan styled, but has a few small twists on the classic VPN formula. It's most distinguishing feature is its tomato sauce, which features a slightly muted tomato flavor. Cutting down on the bright acidity typically found in Neapolitan pizza, the sauce allows other elements of the pizza to come forward. I don't know if \"sweeter\" is the right word, but there seems to be a something that takes out the highest end of the tomato bite. It'll be a hit with every type of pizza fan. 

The other elements of the pizza do come forward and do not disappoint. I tasted the fresh mozzarella more on this pizza than on other local places. Cibo finds a good balance where the sauce is not overtaking the milder flavor of the cheese, which is perfectly melted without starting to brown. The basil on the pizza works just slightly better when the cheese is brought to the front of the flavor too. It's just a really tasty combination that just works on this pizza to slightly different level than on similar pies. 

The crust was probably the weakest point of my visit. Of the two pizzas I tried, one was overcooked and one was undercooked, which was strange. I like a good amount of char, but one half of the pie was dark brown/black. The undercooked pizza had the beginnings of leopard spotting but was too soft on the bottom. Looking around the room, I saw plenty of well-done pizzas, so the oven was working well that night, I just got a couple of duds. The flavor of the crust was pretty average, and I felt like there was a chance for more flavor development. Maybe better texture would have been enough to satisfy me though. I will note that I've been here many times and this is the first time I've had this issue, so I won't ding the star count (though this visit would have been a 4/5). I'm also not personally a fan of pizzas where the center of the pizza is wetter and soggier- I prefer a crispier crust throughout. The pizzas at Cibo trend closer to soggy than crispy in the very middle. 

I tried the Margherita on this visit, and I've had other offerings with different cured meats on top. All of them excel, but the Margherita is my favorite; it's possibly my favorite Margherita downtown. The antipasto board is also fantastic, as was the house bread and Nutella crepe dessert. Service was average but the ambience is wonderful, especially if you sit outside where there is frequently a live musician. 

Cibo might not be VPN certified, but their style of Neapolitan pizza is a must-try for Phoenix pizza lovers. I've yet to be disappointed by anything I ordered off their menu. If you love pizza, you owe it to yourself to stop by. You'll be treated to one of the highlights of the burgeoning pizza scene."}
{"text":"Some of the best Pizza and abiance available in down town phoenix. Truely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Loved the Margherita Pizza. Simple yet so delicious.  
Crazy thing though...my favorite thing there was the Bruschetta.  Had the \"3-way.\"  Oh, the freshness of those tomatoes!   Unbelievable. Lots of basil. So good.  The bean brushcetta came in 2nd.

We didn't really save room for dessert but shared some strawberry crepes anyway-or at least tried to.   The kids went in for the kill and it was gone in about 2.5 seconds.  Have to say though, I enjoyed my one bite thoroughly."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful spot. The food and staff are excellent. This is my first night in Phoenix, flying in from San Francisco and I have been spoiled."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Calgary I've made my way to Cibo! Each time I've gone I've never been disappointed. I live in Edmonton and have never been to the Cibo here, go figure! (sorry YEG!)

I haven't tried everything on their menu, but what I have tried has been excellent. They've also revamped and created a smaller menu, which is honestly better because there were too many choices before and if you have order anxiety like me, you'll never be able to choose!

GET THE WILD BOAR BACON PIZZA. Seriously. Just get it and then thank me. It is to die for!!

Love the atmosphere, what I'd call cozy contemporary. It can get loud because it's really busy but I don't mind that at all, it gives the place extra heart. The service has always been awesome and the servers are really friendly and attentive. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Thank you fellow Yelpers for leading us not astray! We drove to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl on New Years Eve and after the game had no idea where to go for dinner. Once I saw all the fantastic reviews, I decided to call to see how crazy it would be to 'walk in' for dinner. Turns out, not crazy at all! We walked the 5ish blocks from where we were staying to a cute, converted house. It was cozy, warm and welcoming. We were seated immediately at a table which overlooked a fountain in a small area of grass with lawn chairs. Service was perfect - fast enough to keep your stomach from eating itself, but not too fast that you run out of space on the table. We split an order of the calamari, T&K Salad and the Genova pizza. Everything was absolutely delicious and despite how full we were, we kept eating til it was gone! So if you're in the area, definitely stop by and give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Talk about integrity, I dropped some cash on the floor without knowing it...and the employees found it and returned it to me.  Nice! Rick Melville"}
{"text":"So good! Worth the wait for a table. Definitely recommend you arrive early before 7 p.m."}
{"text":"Beyond delicious - everyone here is correct about how great the pizza is and the service is impeccable. The new gluten free menu is the best I have ever tasted, and believe me I have tasted a ton of gluten free pizza!

{"text":"I have been to this place a few times, the food is good but took a while to arrive. The appies are good but extremely small portions... overall, I enjoy place, its fun and happening! I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"While many have complained about the service here, we had a great experience.  Punctual drink top ups, appropriate plate clearing, no rush billing, and best of all the server alerted me to just in time the fact that my car was about to get ticketed by the CPS.

We went for happy hour, when several pizzas are only $5 (only slightly downgraded versions of the normally $15+ pies).  Quasi-neopolitan style, there were a half dozen choices. While all where good, the mushroom pizza with white sauce was a real standout.  I'd say one pizza per person is more than sufficient. Wine is also $5 a glass, and beer $4. A great deal all around.  We also grabbed a Nutella style calzone for dessert.  That was just alright...somehow it needed to be either more moist, or more chocolatey to compel me to order it again.  The quality of the pizza and the good service mean I'm sure we'll be back to try their other wares.

The raw structure and cool decor has lots of brick and reclaimed wood, which makes for a fairly reverberating acoustic environment.  This makes for a pretty lively ambience. For a table of four, it's cool, but I could see it being a bit of a communication headache for larger tables. The solution would be to sit on the lovely patio during the summer months."}
{"text":"yum! I can only attest to the pizza; seriously, try the anchovies! delicious"}
{"text":"I love this place. after I had their pizza I can no longer enjoy pizza hut,  dominoes etc anymore. Also I've never tried Bianco pizzeria and that's beacuse that's always a 2 hour wait. I give 5 stars cause the sevice is awesome, food comes out quick. And the bill is like 50 bucks for two. Cibo is definetly
 winning."}
{"text":"I am going to be nice and give 4 stars, based on potential, on what was really a three star experience.  We are out of towners craving Pizza.  We Yelp the area and were impressed with the reviews for Cibos.  We pull up to what looks to be a house converted into Pizza Restaurant.  We likey.  It is a Sunday a little past standard lunch time 1:30ish so we didn't have to wait...oh wait I think you accidentally gave us the Breakfast menu, where is the Pizza?.  \"uh...well no, actually we don't have Pizza on Sundays until 5PM.  HUH?  Eggs? at 1:30PM on a Sunday?  Maybe 10 years ago when I was single and I slept in until Noon but I ate breakfast HOURS ago.  There were three sandwich selections for lunch and one was almond butter and jelly.  I settled on a grilled Prosciutto sandwich.  If I wasn't craving awesome pizza I would have loved it.  The bread was insane.  Freshly baked to order in their wood burning oven.  The entire family loved their food.  The service was an A+.  The Waitress was really nice and sorry about the no Pizza on Sundays until 5PM thing."}
{"text":"I found this wonderful little spot when I couldn't get into Pizzeria Bianco because the line was so long. What a great little jewel to be had. They have a wonderful atmosphere in a great set in an old house in the historic area the feel is warm and inviting. Don't rush as this is not a place you should rush...enjoy the time with the one you love here. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I were regulars at the old Cibo, and were disappointed in its decline and closure.  I am happy to say that Cibo is back and better than ever!  We had an amazing dinner tonight with mussels, deer carpaccio, beef sugo with fresh pasta and linguine vongole.  Each of these dishes can be disappointing at best if not handled with care, but Cibo prepared each item to perfection.  Fresh whole food ingredients -- no extenders.  We were so impressed with our selections that we splurged and ordered dessert - blood orange cake with Campari sauce and juniper cream.  Absolutely unforgettable!  And a rich coffee French press to accompany the dessert.  The wait staff was friendly, knowledgable and accommodating.  Bravo!  We are so happy Cibo is back -- we will definitely be regulars once again!"}
{"text":"We went to Cibo for Father's Day dinner on Sunday. I was excited to try it, although I had no idea what to expect given their website still claims \"Opening Soon\".
My first thought upon entering was that I liked all the wood work, but I couldn't tell if I was talking to customers or hostesses when I asked about our reservation. I am not entirely sure why it bothered me so much, but the casual dress of all the employees in the restaurant just didn't sit well with me. I don't mind it when I am going to Boxwood, which is located in a park, or Farm, which is a smaller venue and has that home cooked feel to it, but I just didn't like how casually dressed everyone was. Maybe it was the number of servers (I swear there must have been twenty working), but either way, I tried to not let it bother me, but in the end, it was just something I didn't particularly like in the restaurant. 
We were sat upstairs, which seemed to be the 'restaurant' portion, and the 'lounge' was downstairs. I have no problem with restaurants separating their seating by floors, but when I watched an elderly couple trailing up the stairs after their family I honestly didn't feel that putting the restaurant upstairs was a great decision. Do you really want to alienate customers because they can't walk up the stairs? Just a thought. I also wasn't impressed with the paper menus. Paper menus bother me in the sense that they are not very sanitary. They get dirty so easily and you can't clean them. I am not sure if Cibo is just waiting to finalize their menu or what, but ditch the light weight paper menus and get something a little more durable. 
As for the food, our server explained to us that everything was designed to share, and that there was a timing difference in how the food was prepared, as in the pizza would take the longest. We weren't sure how large the appetizers were, so we opted to order 5 (one each) and then see how big they were prior to ordering our other sharing plates. We had the veal, asparagus, eggplant dip, mushrooms and bruschetta. They came out on a long plate, in 5 little dishes served with some crostini. The first thing I noticed was the cheese. I couldn't even see the colours of the vegetables because all I could see is cheese. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE cheese. I have many varieties in my fridge and try not to think of myself as an addict, but when I want cheese, I order cheese, when I want vegetables, I expect to taste vegetables, not cheese. I think that cheese makes a great accompaniment, I think that if you pair it correctly it can make the flavor of whatever it is paired with pop out, but when all I taste is cheese when I bite into an asparagus that apparently is drizzled in truffle oil and I can't taste it, I think there is too much cheese. I did really really enjoy the eggplant dip - no baba ganouche  here - so I would recommend that, but ask for less cheese.
After our appetizers we ordered two pastas and a pizza. There were five of us for dinner, and I asked the server what would be a good amount, so we settled on that. We ordered the gnocchi and the farafelle. The gnocchi was fantastic. Obviously homemade, and fried which gave it a nice crispness. The spinach was fresh and the artichokes and tomatoes were full of the flavor. The farafelle was also very very good. I loved it for the sun-dried tomatoes. Again, a lot of cheese on both pastas. 
Shortly after we finished our pasta, the pizza showed up. It was very very good. Similar to the review below, it is one of the top pizza's I have had in a long time. It isn't thin crust, which for me is great because I love crust, and it was full of flavor, I was very happy with the pizza. We tried the chicken with goat cheese pizza. 
After we finished the pizza we decided to try some dessert. I will say that for the five of us, what we ordered was a great amount for sharing. We had considered ordering a second pizza, but I think that may have been too much. 
We decided to share 4 desserts. We ordered the nutella calzone, cannelloni, date brownie and I believe white chocolate ganache. I am not 100% sure it was ganache, but it was like a pudding type of dessert. First of all, the presentation was terrible. My brownie was literally a brownie on a plate of caramel sauce, and the cannelloni was just the cannelloni in the middle of the plate. They honestly did not look appetizing at all, or pretty/delicate. I like my desserts to look like they were made fresh for me, not taken out of a bag from the freezer, heated up in a microwave and dumped on a plate. I can do that at home. I did not care for the cannelloni or the calzone. Neither had a lot of flavor and just didn't do it for me. The ganache and the brownie were very very good. The brownie was moist, and I love salted caramel, while the ganache had a nice blend of sweetness and fresh cream flavor. 

All in all I would say that Cibo is okay, but I am not impressed, yet."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza spot in the entire state. I typically order the diablo and the small amount of kick it has is perfect. Very small but place I've never had to wait long. Atmosphere is laid back and friendly. Pizza is light and airy with the perfect amount of seasonings. Dessert menu is very limited as they only serve crepes but they are delicious. I always get the banana, strawberry, and Nutella crepe."}
{"text":"I believe that everyone who loves pizza should visit this place. Cibo is famous for their Italian foods but their pizza is the best in town. I've been here a lot of times and they never failed to satisfy me. I love pizza. Want pizza? Go to Cibo now!"}
{"text":"Lunch at Cibo's was amazing. I had their PLT and it was, quite simply, delicious!
Toasted Prosciutto, with tomatoes, fresh greens, and a spicy aoli..my taste buds were very happy with me. 
I added fresh mozzarella to mine.

I would highly recommend this place to everyone and anyone!"}
{"text":"I never would have known this place existed and that would have sucked- if it wasn't for my super duper in the know wife. Took her and a couple of clients here today and the place was awesome!

Cool people, very laid back atmosphere, kick ass food and at a totally fair price. I could stop there but I will go on....

The guy who met us at the door- cool. Our waitress- cool. The nice lady who filled up my tea like 7 times without giving me the \"seriously dude\" look- yup, cool. 

On the location- We met at 11:30- way early by downtown lunch standards so I was kinda freaked out from the look of things out front, not much happening. Once we got inside, it made me feel like I had stumbled into the kind of place I wanna be in. Nice and clean, but totally got that old converted house feeling (in a good way). Oh, and by 12:30 when we left- packed!

The food- Yum! At our table there were two PLT's (one of them mine), basically prosciutto, lettuce & tomato, a pastrami sandwich and another sammy that I cannot recall. What I can recall is that everyone liked them- me especially. It was great... perfectly toasted bread, great fillings and a nice little salad. And for desert since my lady companions insisted- a crepe suzette and a crepe with nutella. And of course- damn!

The price- Bout $60 for all 4 of us. I would have spent that easily at some place that I would not have been half as happy with. 

Final thought- go, eat, drink tea and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food, super service, warm and friendly staff."}
{"text":"My favorite gluten free pizza ever! They have a spicy sausage that's fantastic. Service has always been great. Be sure to sit outside and get their iced tea...so yum! They have a live jazz band that does radiohead covers, which is the perfect cherry on top!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in the Phoenix area and probably one of the best pizzas on the west coast. Worth the trip and wait."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance . Quaint Urban setting in an old downtown home. Live music, patio dining as well as indoors.   Beer and Wine bar."}
{"text":"I picked up a friend from the Airport and came across this cute little patio/restaurant while driving around downtown Phoenix. When we were seated, we enjoyed the warm sunshine and live music they were providing on s Sunday afternoon. I ordered the Porcellino sandwich: homemade  BBQ pork with fontina cheese. The service was awesome and kept our ice teas filled up at all times. A little history on this place: Set in a restored 1913 bungalow, Cibo (pronounced \"CHEE-boh\") has hardwood floors, exposed brick, a stained-glass panel and a fireplace to set the mood while revitalizing the downtown Phoenix area with beautiful salads, antipasto, artisanal pizzas and housemade fresh pasta."}
{"text":"Appalled at the service and staff. Uninspiring food did little to make up for it. Too many things with the service were off which leads me to believe there is a serious issue with management.

Every member of staff was dressed in raggedy clothes and they didn't look very happy at all either. The majority of them were frowning... our waitress was nice and smiled a lot but looked stoned and reeked of bad b.o. (yes it's hot in AZ but try to prudently refresh yourself every hour or so if you know you're getting sweaty). We waited 10+ minutes to be greeted by her despite her coming to check on the tables right next to us. Her service through the night was very erratic and left a lot to be desired.

We ordered the lasagna as an appetizer and a Salsiccia pizza for dinner but the pizza came out first! Needless to say I was very irritated that a pre-made lasagna failed to make its way out of the kitchen before a pizza.

The pizza was barely above average. The fennel sausage and the mozzarella were good but the crust and sauce didn't prove to be anything memorable. There are far superior places in the valley including one just blocks away and even a nationwide brand of pizzerias so to not even beat out a large chain was very disappointing.

The lasagna offered nothing special and was quite worthless being ordered as an appetizer but arriving after the entree.

Bland food, low staff morale, and terrible service just made for a bad experience and with these many problems in one night I didn't even want to waste my time giving a manager feedback. I just wanted to run out as fast as possible."}
{"text":"I really liked this salad when I had it sometime ago let's hope it's as good as I remember it!!"}
{"text":"Cibo is da bomb!

After eating Cibo's Diavola and Vegiteriana pizzas, I will never eat another pizza again, they all are obsolete.

Even before you sink your teeth into one of Cibo's sultry pizzas you will fall in love with the quaint yet fun atmosphere of this little gem of a restaurant. Then, after you are seated, you will fall in love with the two cutest waiters ever! As if that weren't sweet enough, the fresca crepe is the absolute most delectable dessert on the face of the planet!

All of Cibo's courses are fresh and flavorful. You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu. The last time I was there with my five friends, we sat outside at a table next to the fire pit. We ordered the house salad, the pesto salad, the vegetariana, the diavola, the margarita, and finished it off with two frescas. The only thing that could have made the night better, was if the cute waiters would have joined us ;-)

I can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place

1) Food is amazing, even the salads.
2) Service is good.
3) The patio is gorgeous, especially during the day time."}
{"text":"Beautiful d√©cor in a 1920's bungalow. The patio during good weather is especially romantic. Sometimes they have live music on the weekends. The only gripe I have is about the difficult parking situation, but I won't deduct any stars because this is really beyond their control. Food is fantastic. I highly recommend the Tartufata (sp??) pizza and a nutella crepe for dessert. Customer service is always great. This would be an excellent choice for an occasion- date night, anniversary, birthday. Not great for a bigger crowd- better for a small/intimate duo."}
{"text":"First the good: The food is generally tasty if a bit overpriced and smallish in portions.  I have enjoyed the happy hour pizzas for years.  Sadly, I now have to steer folks away from this place, due to some highly unsavory practices.

Towards the end of our evening at Cibo, we were informed that because there were a little over 30 people in our party, the minimum bill would be $3500.  That's over $100 per person!  For a meal we had pre-ordered at around $50/plate.  The time to mention this ridiculous minimum would have been when the reservation and orders were made.  Not after the third course.

The minimum charge was reduced to $2000 (thanks!), but even with the hundreds of dollars in wine and drinks added, we didn't reach it, and each person had an extra $12 surcharge applied to their bill.  Now, the service was good enough, and the added %20 tip expected, so I don't blame the servers because they clearly weren't getting any of the money the restaurant was effectively stealing from their captive diners.  30 people x $12 (pre-tax, pre-tip) = $360 of free money for the restaurant.  They didn't even offer any extra food or drinks.  $12 isn't the end of the world for me, but I would be writing a different (still critical, but less so) review had I gone home with a $12 slice of cake or something.  But this was simply robbery.  As unethical as I have seen in a restaurant.

We asked to speak with management and were denied.  In the end, we paid the absurd \"fine\" and I now have to say goodbye to a once decent neighborhood restaurant.  If you treat your clientele reasonably, they will support you through the tough times.  But if you screw them over, they will turn on you.  I see a bleak future for Cibo and the other restaurants in this chain.

*** Updated December 15, 2018 ***
I'm pleased to say that management, after reviewing communications between our party and Cibo staff, has adequately rectified what turned out to be an unfortunate case of miscommunication.  They did so with graciousness and professionalism.  I'm still a fan, and I'll be back.  The food really is good!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after friends recommended this place! I was impressed with the customer service and food was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"cibo met some kind of pizza ideal that had never been articulated in words for me.  the crust was thin, but not as thin as pizzeria bianco. the portions of cheese were slightly more generous than those of pomo and bianco. the red sauce was just slightly sweet and seasoned perfectly. my favorite pizza, though, was a white pizza, the genova, with pesto as the sauce, mozzarrella, parmesan, onions, and potatoes. perfect. this is the type of pizza, if it were healthier to eat such a thing every day, i would be eating 7 nights a week. i think adding ricotta cheese would make it even better, like it did for one of the red pizzas we tried, as cibo's ricotta has a pleasant nutty flavor. i can't count the places where i've added ricotta to a pizza and it had absolutely no flavor whatsoever, but not at cibo.

tried a salad, too, which was fresh though heavy on the vinegar in the dressing. also tried the bruschetta. the bread was good, but not as good as that of lamp pizzeria in north scottsdale, or second runner up ( bread-wise), pizzeria bianco. the bruschetta comes in a gigantic portion. three large, thick slices of bread split in half. one with buffalo mozzarella and a meat that looked like proscuitto (didn't try that one), one slice with grape tomatoes and basil (awkward to eat because the halved grape tomatoes are small and kept falling off), one with a cannellini bean and eggplant spread. this antipasti alone is very filling and i regret eating so much of it (especially the savory cannellini bruschetta) before the perfect pizzas arrived.

i can't wait to go back and try some more antipasti and pizzas at cibo. a cute place, an appealing menu well executed."}
{"text":"I can't think of a better place to enjoy a glass of wine and an amazing antipasto or calzone. This place has probably one of the best patios in Phoenix and the coolest part is that it is an old historical district house that was transformed into a mom and pop style italian kitchen. I have tried quite a few things on their menu from the burrata and proscuitto to multiple different pizzas and they have managed to walk away unscathed and for that, the patio, the service, and ambiance I think they deserve 5 stars."}
{"text":"Always enjoy eating here.  The Chef makes a good pizza.  If you like the pizza in southern Italy, you will love the pizza here."}
{"text":"Happy to see another modern Italian dining option! I tried Cibo last night (Tuesday) with three friends. Three of us arrived first and the fourth came later on. The restaurant was packed when we arrived at 7:30 pm. Sadly the wait for the patio was over an hour, but luckily there was an inside table opening up. We were seated within 5 minutes without reservations. 

The interior of the restaurant is beautiful. They have used a lot of local repurposed materials. The space feels casual, open, and contemporary. Our table was in a very loud spot, near the kitchen, but I imagine some of the corner tables must be a bit quieter. 

We ordered three scodellina; tuscan chicken liver, arancini and lamb meatballs. The servings were too small. For $11 we got two loonie-sized arancini, three slightly smaller lamb meatballs, and approx 3 tbsp chicken liver spread. I would rather pay a bit more and get more food. I am a huge fan of arancini, and Cibo's may be my favourite in the city (aside from the small portion). The veal inside is a great addition. I notice on the website menu, the lamb meatballs and arancini are available as antipasti on the lunch menu, potentially these are larger servings? We also ordered the sausage pizza and the mushroom pizza. Both were great. The crust is a bit sweet. The caramelized onions on the sausage pizza were my favourite part.

The bar has Village beer on tap, and they serve it by the glass instead of the pint. I prefer it this way, but others may want the full pint. 

The service is a bit slow, and the appetizers took close to 20 minutes to come out. I get a bit of an amateur vibe from the servers, like this is their first serving job. They still do a good job, but you don't get the same level of care as restaurants with a similar price point."}
{"text":"I went to Cibo for lunch on a weekday. The service was excellent. The food was good. I had the arancini and the gnocchi. The arancini was a little different from what I've had elsewhere as it had peas in it (the menu tells you this). The price ($8) for 5 balls was reasonable. This appetizer could easily serve two people or three (if they are small eaters). The gnocchi is also a little different as it doesn't have an alfredo or tomato sauce but an oil sauce with spinach and artichokes and the individual gnocchi are seared. The artichokes and lemon make it a little tart so if you don't like sour flavours, don't order this.  After having an appetizer, the pasta dish was very filling and I had no room for dessert. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"I've waited too long to write this review.

Go here.  Now.  If you're reading this you should go there.  Seriously.  Take the day off early to make sure you don't have to wait.

Pizza is great, fresh and authentic.  We had also a deli meat/cheese plate and holy crap was that good.  My friend and I could have got another one of those if our wives would have let us.  It reminded us both of our trip to Italy and the quality meats there.

The ambiance is awesome here, but small.  It is an old house but they also have outdoor seating which I bet would be nice on cool evening.  

Seriously, this place is great.  Sad I didn't know about it sooner.

Oh, and the crepes...yum."}
{"text":"Always a great spot to meet friends and know you're getting good food and good service. Awesome outdoor patio"}
{"text":"My friends love this place but I just thought it was okay.  It really depends on the style of pizza you like.  I don't like pizza that is really more bread based than sauce based.  The sauce makes or breaks a pizza for me.  The pizza here doesn't use a lot of sauce or cheese.  If you are a fan of good crust you may love this place but it is not my cup of tea.  I am spoiled since I am from Chicago where there are great pizza places everywhere.  Phoenix has a lot of places people tell me the are really good but I find most of them to be average at best.  It is hard to compare Lou Malnattis or Giordano's in Chicago to anything here."}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza! Great setting. Pasta: mmmm could be better. But they make the effort, great service. Reasonable prices. We had a great time, lights in the garden."}
{"text":"If you are gluten free I highly recommend visiting this place . The gluten free pizza is garlicky,  spicy goodness on a fresh baked real pizza crust.  Its to die for. The service however leaves something to be desired. They didn't have enough wait staff and one person waiting on 10+ tables was inhumane."}
{"text":"I recently was helped by Jordan Leugers at 5114s Rural Rd., Tempe.  I would like to say that I was very pleased with the help I got from Jordan.  He was very patient with me as I asked questions about my new phone.

It is great to know that any future questions that I may have I can go to the store and get the help I need.

{"text":"Great place! Sunday brunch is always enjoyable, sitting on the patio, under the tree. Everything is shareable (which is nice to try a few things). Have been going for years"}
{"text":"Barbeque pulled pork sandwich with fontina cheese, I miss you already.  Yummers.  And the pizza?  Holy frak.  Incredible.  Love Cibo."}
{"text":"Pretty good... I ordered the Margharita and the wifey had the Genova pizza, before that we shared a salad...

Ok so the place and atmosphere was probably my favorite thing about the experience... I just like being in old buildings... this one was built in 1913... so I personally enjoyed just looking around. Plenty of seating inside or out... so thats all good...

The food was pretty good, I would not go back to order the Margharita pizza again, but I'll definitely go back to check out the rest of the menu... just to throw this out there... there is another very well known pizza spot down the road in which I WOULD go back just to get some more of that Margharita pizza... this one is good, but not as good as the place down the road! The Genova was freakin great... pesto, mozzarella, onion, potato... kind of like we had in italy... No regrets about the food, it was good, the salad was $14 which was good, but not 14 bucks good! The pizza is worth the trip and the money. If you read my reviews i base my rating on my desire to return... i give it 4 stars because the food was good enough that I'll definitely go back to taste the rest of that good sized menu, but not 5 because it wasn't upto par with other pizza ive had around the area! 

*** i will say this though... CIbo seems more accommodating for larger parties... just sayin'."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and I can't get what all the hype is about.

 I reaaaally want to be on board this band wagon but I just can't find the flavor in the pizza. 

 I do like the location though and the servers are always awesome.
 
 Great atmosphere, cool vibe, good people...not my favorite pizza.

 I'll chance the 50/50 of Grazie's in Old Town in getting my order right every other time if I want the perfect pizza, but I'll still keep trying Cibo."}
{"text":"Meal and service was exceptional! The pasta was simple and tasty. The nice brick interior and music added a great ambiance. The Maculan wine is a must have! Nutella anything is my favorite."}
{"text":"GREAT place for lunch! Try the Caprese if you are in the mood for a cold sandwich and the Spec for a more warmed up approach. Cibo has an awesome patio so take advantage of it when the weather is nice in Phoenix and the quaint inside house in the summer."}
{"text":"Great food...check, Great atmosphere...check, reasonable prices...check! How can you go wrong with Cibo. This is one of my favorite places for lunch downtown. I have been there numerous times and I am never disappointed. 

I always tend to have the Salciccia sandwich which is sausage, onions, peppers and mozzarella cheese with a great house salad.  At dinner they serve delicious pizza.

The wait staff is always nice and very helpful. This is a great date place if you want to avoid all the chain places that occupy most of Phoenix.  Definitely try it out."}
{"text":"I am totally biased as I eat here way too often, but it is worth five stars. Everything is fantastic. I recommend the antipasto, for starters and for pizza, I am a fan of the capricciosa, the diavola, and the salsiccia. If you like white, the sienna and the di notte are both killer. The pasta specials are usually out of control good and the banana nutella crepe is probably my favorite desert in Phoenix (though the Pizzookie at Oreganos is a close second). For lunch the PLT (Proscuitto, Lettuce, and Tomato) is divine!

I would say that the staff is comprised of some of the kindest people I have ever met and I have never had a bad experience there! Highly, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is one of my neighborhood favorites, its a nice small place to enjoy some really tasty italian food.
I don't know if people on here are disappointed because they go in with false expectations-but the food here is fantastic and not at all mass produced tasting. Yes, its a small place with the neighboring table right on top of you but sometimes that's part of the charm of city dining. 
My husband and I have been here multiple times and love the chef's sauces from the leek muscle cream sauce, to the bolognese to pesto. I also love their bread and seasoned olive oil dipping. This bread is authentic, tuscan style bread.  If this place falls short, in my opinion its on their high $7 corkage fee (aside from free mondays)"}
{"text":"In our three visits here we have had no problem with service or being seated. Sure, it's hopping busy but you have to expect that from any restaurant in the area. 

Cibo has my heart (and our wallets) for 3 reasons:

-Locally sourced foods. 

They really care about what they are putting into your meal. This theme is apparent throughout the menu and with each bite of their amazing pasta or pizza. 

- Community focus

I will never forget walking out of there one evening before thanksgiving and seeing this sign. 

\"We want your family to join our family this thanksgiving. $40 for a family of 4 to enjoy turkey dinner here\" not the exact wording but you catch my drift? Which brings me to my final point. 

-Value

When you eat food this good you may expect to be hit with a large bill at the end. Not here. My husband and I always manage to walk out having gladly handed over 70 or less including drinks and appies!!! That's $70 for two to indulge on food that is actually good for you in an atmosphere that is alive and thriving. 

Thanks, Cibo, for caring about our world and community, and about our stomachs!!"}
{"text":"Cibo is my absolute favorite pizza restaurant! I love the atmosphere which is what I like to call, elegant-hipster and caters to a wide variety of people. My favorite is the burrata as an appetizer and the funghi pizza."}
{"text":"So here's a bit recap of our night at Cibo:

Outdoor seating - 5 star
I'm not gonna lie, the outdoor seating is so romantic and beautiful with the trees and lights around!

Caprese Salad - 2.5 star
Not a good experience, the mozzarella was not soft, can't taste the freshness at all...$10 for four big piece of white yet no flavored cheese,,such a mistake.the tomato tasted much better on the other hand...and hello, are you running out of olive oil? I can barely see a few drops on the bottom of the plate...

Salsicca con Patate - 3 star
Pizza with mozzarella, sausage and roasted potatoes. It was surprisingly good for the first slice, the potatoes were soft, cheese was melting, and sausage was pretty tasty...but that's because I never had it before, starting my 2nd slice, I realized that no sauce pizza can mean tasteless, the flavor started losing...err, can I have some chili pepper?

Fresca (crepe) - 5 star!!!!
This would be my only reason to go back if I did..thin crepes with fresh kiwi, strawberries, peach, vanilla ice cream and whip cream! Yum!!! It was heaven for any crepe lover! Must try!!
 
Service - 2 star
The place seemed to be very busy yet I only see one real waitress that was running around to take orders, the rest were just servers who don't talk to you....we spent so much time to wait for her to come, to bring us a menu, or just deliver the check....

Wait - 4 star
Compare to Bianco, the wait is short. We arrived around 7:30pm on a Saturday, the wait was only about 15min,,sweet! But the indoor seating was kinda squeezed in...

So it comes to a 3.58 average..I had a much higher expectation when read the previous reviews, meh, I hate to admit, but I definitely love Bianco and LGO a lot more.."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the pizza! The diavola is my fav- juicy & slightly spicy. My mouth is seriously salavating as I write this. I know it's strange for a pizza to be juicy, so let me explain...the fresh ingredients melting perfectly in the brick oven for an incredible burst of flavors in your mouth - JUICY!!! For apps I was introduced to the Burrata, which is outstanding and give the bruschetta and caprese a try, also yummy. Dessert wise the crepes with nutella are lip-smacking good as well as the nutella shake. (yep, I'm a fan of nutella)

Delightful atmosphere, patio lit with strands of lights, charming historic house inside.

Sometimes they have live music but I'm not sure how to find out this information. Also, they serve homemade pasta on a selected day :)"}
{"text":"Honestly, all this place REALLY is, is atmosphere. That in its self is pretty amazing the lights at night, the home-y feel, it's also quite romantic. My date and I weren't that pleased with the food and the dining area is very, very small and tight. Again food wasn't that great, just pizza, really nothing special. Glad i at least tried it out but isn't something I'd return to."}
{"text":"Outdoor patio - gorgeous. Food - excellent and fresh. Wine selection - also excellent. Service - a little disjointed. It's never bad, but definitely don't come here if you're in a hurry. Plan to settle in, relax, and enjoy a great meal."}
{"text":"This is NOT the old Cibo's!  The dishes are creative and the flavors and preparations are amazing. We had the duck confit as an appetizer - this made us take notice.  The Boston Bibb salad with radish and truffle oil was ascetically beautiful, the aroma was fabulous and the taste was sweet and tender. I had the lamb kabob and basmati rice and it was even more amazing than the duck. My husband had the rabbit with greens and white beans which was just as delicious. We finished with the salted Carmel custard which carried this meal over the top. The fabulous service from Mary and visit to the table from Jen the chef made it beyond expectations. HOME RUN!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in eons but, I am going to drag b/f here soon and see what he thinks."}
{"text":"For the past year and a half, it seems like every article, TV program, and person I know who raves about pizza in Downtown Phoenix that isn't at Bianco has been telling me that I must try Cibo.  \"It's amazing! The food is fantastic! The service is wonderful! They're so friendly there!\" they all cry with passion.

After my experience tonight, the only things I can think of are either (1) I somehow entered a parallel universe around that block and entered a different Cibo, kind of like that episode of \"Star Trek,\" or (2) every one of those sources from my first paragraph is full of beans.  Given that no one working in the restaurant had the necessary Evil Spock-esque goatee, I'm going to assume the latter.  Lest you think I'm being too negative about this place, let me say this: Cibo is definitely a place that serves food.

We (there were three of us) came in at 6:45 on a Friday and were able to get a seat within 5 minutes, even though the patio and inside were both packed - score!  It was a table tucked away in a corner, which we felt would be good for keeping ambient noise to a minimum,

After scoping out some of the food at the other tables, it was determined that a shared appetizer and two pizzas should have been enough for the three of us.  We chose the Schiacciata Maremma, which, besides being impossible for me to pronounce, was described as a roasted vegetable on focaccia-type sandwich, and the margherita (traditional) and funghi (mushroom) pizzas.

The sandwich came first, and we thought that the order may have been put in wrong.  While it was definitely two pieces of bread (that looked and tasted nothing like any focaccia that I've ever had, and not in the good way) with stuff in the middle, it seemed to be missing half of the ingredients.  Billed as being filled with \"mozzarella, roasted bell peppers, eggplant and zucchini,\" we discovered that there was neither eggplant or zucchini anywhere to be found.  Additionally, the whole sandwich was cold, depriving us of gooey, melted mozzarella-y goodness.  We would have complained to our waitress, but she had disappeared, deciding early on to abandon our table after taking our order, serving every other table in the section except for ours.

When the pizzas came (brought by a different waitress), things looked up.  THIS is what Cibo is known for, right?  Quality pizza with fresh ingredients!  Tasty, simple pizza.  Maybe it was a bit TOO simple.

The margherita pizza was a disaster.  The sauce was thin and runny, tasting like the tomato water left over from the can after the tomatoes were used to make the actual pizza sauce, with a lot of salt added in to attempt to cover for the lack of actual spices and seasoning.  The basil was haphazardly thrown on top, most of it still attached to one sprig.  I suppose that if Cibo was billed as an interactive cooking and eating experience, I might have appreciated that a bit more.  After the first slice was eaten, I figured that maybe I had grabbed a bad one (which can happen sometimes with pizzas), so I tried a different slice from the other side of the pie.  It was cold already, and quite soggy.  Since Cibo makes their pizzas with those \"brick oven blisters\" on 'em, this means that the remaining slices all had that watery charcoal flavor that tastes like the cooled-down grill you licked on a dare while drunk last Memorial Day.

The funghi pizza was passable.  The mushrooms did a good job of hiding a lot of the issues (mainly the sauce) that the margherita pizza had.  It too, however, decided that it should freeze up like the surface of Hoth (sans tauntaun innards) after the first slices were taken.

Fifteen minutes after we'd decided that we were done eating soggy pizza, our server decided to stop by our table again.  After all, the folks who were seated ten minutes after we were had completed their dessert, so she realized that she should probably see how our meal was going.  Drinks that had sat un-refilled since our appetizer was served were topped off without warning, and she walked away again, our napkin-covered plates still waiting to be picked up.  \"Do you want any dessert...\" she muttered in an almost muted tone after a different waitress cleared our table.  We said no and asked for the check.  Seven minutes later, she remembered to bring over the check.

We paid in cash and got the heck out of Dodge, wondering how so many people could have led us wrong, how the place stayed so busy, and if maybe, our taste buds had betrayed us.  After all, the denizens of the Arizona Republic, Yelp, and even \"Check Please! Arizona\" had vouched for this place, to say nothing of our friends and work acquaintances.  We decided that there's a massive conspiracy going on, and Cibo has either paid you all off, or laces their food with hypnotic suggestion drugs to which we are somehow impervious.

The food is bad. The service is awful. Stay away."}
{"text":"I will preface my negative review by saying that I reached out to Cibo on Saturday morning (Oct 22) the day after my experience. As of the 27th, I have not heard back from them. Here's how it went down.

¬†¬†We arrived around 8:10 for our 8:00 reservation, which is definitely our bad. But since we didn't see a server until 8:20, it obviously wasn't a huge deal. I do not know our server's name, as he never introduced himself, welcomed us to Cibo, or even said hello. He never even smiled, now that I think about it. Basically, he just asked for a drink order. When it came time to place our dinner order, we had to ask him about the features of the evening, which maybe he forgot to tell us, who knows. I ordered a bruschetta, and the rotisserie feature, and my girlfriend ordered a burrata and the ravioli. There were seven of us dining, and the server didn't write anything down. Not a good sign. After about five minutes our server came back and told my girlfriend that the pumpkin ravioli was actually gone, and that she \"needs to order something else.\" About 20 minutes later, the server returned to the table to ask if anyone would like another glass of wine, and then said to my girlfriend, and I quote, \"did you wanna order some food?\" She asked for the gnocchi instead of the ravioli. At this point, every water glass on the table had been empty for approximately 30 minutes, as we're now approaching 9:00pm. My girlfriend's gnocchi came out around 9:15, which was okay, but the garlic was definitely burnt. As we approached 9:30, I still didn't have my rotisserie feature. Perhaps it's partially my fault for not inquiring earlier as to the whereabouts of my food, but I do my best to be as easy to serve as possible when our server was clearly very busy; likely why everyone's water glasses were empty for almost our entire meal. At approximately 9:45 our server came back to the table and asked if we'd like anything else, and at that time my girlfriend asked our server to simply cancel my rotisserie feature. He gasped, and admitted that he, \"totally forgot to even ring it in.\" He followed that up by asking me rhetorically, \"how did I not notice you didn't have any food?\" He then asked if I'd like anything else off the menu, or if I'd like another glass of wine. I declined and just asked for the bill, since everyone at our table was long finished their meals.

¬†¬†I'm not so concerned that the server forgot my entr√©e, because we all make mistakes, and in my years of serving tables I've forgotten a ton of things. It happens. My issues were with his demeanor, and how the situation was handled. How does a server not even smile? I've spent years of my life in restaurants, and I've never seen a server so unwelcoming. I've literally had better service ordering a taquito at 7-11. On top of this, no visit from a manager to the table, nothing comped from the bill, not even our first round of drinks were taken care of. The server quietly gave me a gift card for next time for $25, which is not even the price of the entr√©e that I ordered and never received. So all in all, I was handed a bill for $82, and I didn't even have dinner."}
{"text":"My wife and I love going here.  We've probably been there a few times a year for the past 6 or 7 years.  We usually get the pesto salad, di notte pizza and a nougat crepe.  Have never had a bad experience, great place when the weather is really nice out as well."}
{"text":"Great food and ambience! We are from out of town and were nervous based n other reviews but our experience was fantastic, portions are large as well. Great value!"}
{"text":"I like this quaint little restaurant although the space is a bit crowded - especially during peak times. Too bad all they really serve is Pizza (there are other things on the menu - but not much else). I thought the Pizza was OK - but certainly nothing to rave about. Desert was awesome -- they have a selection of crepes to choose from which are ALL to die for! 

Bottom line: Experience is nice and unexpected for Phoenix. Food is not disappointing as long as you aren't expecting a lot. Desert is special."}
{"text":"What an adorable place!?!  Cibo is most definitely an oh-so-hip hidden pizzeria gem tucked away a little off the beaten path from central downtown Phoenix.  [This could very easily be a pizza joint found in any neighborhood in San Francisco.]  Picture this: soft, low lighting, faint, hip music playing overhead, ecclectic flair for decorations, friendly staff, amazing aromas wafting from the kitchen -- my heart was all a flutter from the moment I walked in.

I came here based off of a recommendation of one of my best friends and absolutely loved the Quattro Formaggi pizza; the gorgonzola cheese gave the pie a full-bodied flavor.  Trust me, it's a must for all you cheese-lovers out there like me.  ;-)

I would most definitely come back here on my next trip to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"5 friends and I (we were 3 couples) met at Cibo for a Friday evening dinner. Overall, our experience was good but not remarkable. The service is good (to be expected of a place like this), food was good (some mixed feelings), and the atmosphere is great. Come to Cibo if you do not have Friday night dinner reservations--when most places are crowded, we were one of only 3 parties in the restaurant. It was a good experience in that respect.

Cibo's atmosphere is quiet, contemporary, relaxed, and very clean. It is very easy to feel at ease here with a glass of wine in hand, talking to a single or bunch of friends. This restaurant is nice (not too casual and not stuffy at all).

I highly recommend the mussels in white wine sauce appetizer--the mussels were tender, flavorful and some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh. On the other hand, my Atlantic Cod entree with string beans was good (not bad) but unimaginative. My companions had no compliments (but no complaints either) about their dishes. For dessert, I recommend the Tiramisu. The apple and berry pie was good but better for a more rustic sensibility.

Cibo is a solid choice for an evening meal in Regent Square, especially since there are so few other options in the neighborhood (Root 174 and Istanbul Sofra are the only others on the street). Do, however, expect to pay a pretty penny for your meal. Corkage fees are $7/bottle, charged a maximum of 3 times per party. Two people can expect to spend around $70 for 1 appetizer, an entree each, 1 dessert to share plus 1 corkage fee."}
{"text":"I'm a regular. the food is excellent. the service... well, here's my experience. the website days they take reservations. when I called to make a reservation, I was told \"we only do walk-ins. so you're welcome to come in.\" I started to ask a question and was hung up on.
I didn't feel that was okay.
Will be going somewhere else for awhile."}
{"text":"Nutella, bananas, chocolate- I know I shouldn't start with dessert, but their crepes are so good I can't resist. Everything here is good, the patio is great, the owners are on site and very friendly."}
{"text":"THE BEST AUTHENTIC ITALIAN IN ARIZONA - do not accept substitutes. This is real authentic cuisine. Not NY family style. Not North Jersey/Sopranos style. Genuine old country Italian with ingredients flown in from the boot daily. I recommend the tuna nicoise salad with pine nuts for lunch and every pizza on the menu is better than the next for dinner. Dessert? Try and find a better alternative to the Nutella creeps. If you prefer eating at that \"other\" place that competes with Cibo, you probably think Del Taco makes really great  authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short n sweet. This place has never let me down. I have had multiple visits and ordered something different every time and it has always been fantastic. very reasonably priced as well - this place could charge a LOT more than they do. kudos! 

I hope this restaurant stays up n running for a while because its definitely apart of my top 5!"}
{"text":"Quick back story - I work for a major retailer and focus heavily on customer experience. My wife owns a local establishment - where we focus on . . . yep . . customer experience. We eat at all the local joints in Phoenix and eat all the amazing food we can find. The only issue . . . we always . . always . . get the worst customer experience. 

So my wife is 40 weeks pregnant and her birthday was Monday. She wanted - homemade pasta. So we went to Cibo. Everything started off well, greeted right away, service was up to speed - it was looking good. We ordered the house salad, Diavolo pizza and a homemade pasta. 

We got the salad first - it was perfect.

Then came the pizza - it was even more perfect than the salad. That's when it happened . . . AGAIN. The waitress came back and asked us if we were ready for dessert - she FORGOT our pasta. 

Normally, I would have said something. But this literally was the 5th consecutive time we have gone out to eat at a local joint in Phoenix where they completely forgot us, or something we ordered. 

We tipped the waitress well, even though she forgot to place the right order and left. Unfortunately for Cibo - I will once again be looking for the local Phoenix restaurant that is consistent, not only with their food, but with their service. I should NEVER have to ask for my food twice .  . . hopefully they will learn."}
{"text":"Oh wow - pizza and ambiance were a homerun. Excellent service. But damn. That pizza - can't forget the taste! Be sure to build enough time to wait for a table. Although we only waited 20 mins on a Saturday night post 9pm.

The live jazz and outdoor seating decorated with dim bulbs makes it romantic and relaxing. Prego!"}
{"text":"All Good -- Great lunch today. Service was good. We wanted to eat outside today given the weather but no shade tables were available. No worries -- we had a wonderful meal inside. We are a party of 4 that loves pizza and hungry. We had the DiNotte, Salsiccia and the Genova pizzas. They all were excellent-- fresh crust not too thick and the dough had been allowed to rise properly. Toppings were all fresh and there are multiple non tomatoe sauce options which is to my liking. The Gorgonzola on the DiNotte pizza gave it a unique distinctive flavor(good). We also had 2 salads -- the house salad was very fresh. In my opinion the biggest distinction was the freshly grated Parmesan flakes. My wife had the only other salad offered prior to 3 on Sat which had strawberries, goat cheese, and candies walnuts over spinach. My wife added grilled chicken and enjoyed it all.
The restaurant is not close to my house, however I will go back again when I am near downtown for lunch again."}
{"text":"Dinner with relatives - six adults.  Had reservations at 5 pm and were seated promptly.  Then our waiter spent 15 minutes detailing every pizza on the menu...duh, like we couldn't read them for ourselves.  He fawned over the menu until we were sick of him and just wanted to order.  First came our salads, which he insisted we get.  All I can say is yuk.  They just were weird and not that good for the price.

Then he disappeared.  Two non-english speaking girls brought our pizzas, but wouldn't take our six dirty salad plates and utensils.  What fun it is to eat your main course with dirty dishes all over the table.  Our waiter had GUARANTEED us that the pizzas would be the best we had ever eaten.  Meh.  I've had better at NYPD Pizza.  

But what really ticked me off is that we could get no refills on beverages, no dirty dishes cleared, and nobody would get me a clean fork to eat my calzone.  For this price I think I'm entitled to a clean utensil.  Yes, the menu states that parties 6 or more will have gratuity automatically added.  I'm cool with that, except that at Cibo's that means \"after we take your order we don't have to offer you any more service, and we still get our 20%.\"

I'd never go back.  Just wasn't worth the $$."}
{"text":"Very relaxing atmosphere. We sat outside and there was live music as well as lots of greenery to keep the sun off. Food came in a reasonable time and very good, but I thought it was a little overpriced. Still, it's a good place for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"The vibe & patio with live jazz music was really nice.  The beer was not cold & the wine was warm. The calamari was good not the best. Warm not hot
 The pasta dish was ok. The pasta noodles were way more than al dente and the pizza crust was downright soggy in the center.  Not worth the trip down town to go ."}
{"text":"Awesome music , out or inside atmosphere the food and dessert are fabulous ! Yummie

Waiter give excelent service !"}
{"text":"I really like Cibo. I've been here for lunch, dinner, and a special event at the \"Carriage House.\" The food is really good. I prefer the sandwiches over the pizzas - especially the caprese sandwich.
They also had happy hour the last time I was there and the prices aren't amazing, but it's decent for what you get. I would skip the fried dough pieces. The fried rice balls are excellent, and the drink prices are really good.
Oh, and the little salad that comes with the sandwich is perfection. Plus, the weather is perfect right now and they have a large patio seating area."}
{"text":"Pretty huge noisy place. We had a fantastic waiter, don't remember his name. The food was okay..nothing to write home about.."}
{"text":"Everything on paper looks perfect.  We waited 45 minutes for a table that never came.  Called before I got there to make sure it wasn't too bad.  I was told to expect a 20 minute wait.  No biggie.  After a 45 minute wait, I was told another 30 were required.  Had tickets to Tosh so I had to leave.  Thank goodness for the magic speed the brothers from Los Dos Molinos put on their chile rellenos.  It was like they were crossing the Rio Grande all over again.  Screw SB1070,  I need mexican food anyways!

Food may be good, but I'll never know now."}
{"text":"We are visiting from California. We took a chance and chose Cibo for our dinner reunion with family. The food was outstanding! However, we learned quickly that the chef does not appreciate any kind of special request. Two of us ordered the same pasta and one requested to add olives. The chef refused and sent the plate out to us without olives. The server, trying to keep peace, brought us a bowl of olives so we could add our own. There is a $2.00 charge to have the veggies on the veggie pizza sliced and mixed across the whole pizza. Finally, we asked for a dessert to take with us but the chef refuses to put his desserts in a box and sent the server out to inform us of this. The dessert came on a plate and we put it into a box ourselves at the table. The servers should be commended for running interference between the paying customer and the egocentric chef."}
{"text":"I typically agree with Yelp ratings, so the cognitive dissonance I've experienced twice now going to Cibo is really strange for me. I have to chalk it up to going both times during lunch, when they don't serve pizza, because people seem to be crazy for the pizza here, but everything I've had at this place just plain sucks. From a mushy \"meatball\" sandwich that played more like an Italian sloppy joe to the criminally dry, flavorless salad topped stingily with tiny, cold chunks of bland chicken. I don't have any good words for any of the entrees I have tried here and nothing my companions ordered looked especially appealing either.

Oh cool! They start you out with some bread on a cutting board. Ask them for butter though, and you'll be informed that they don't have any. No butter! A restaurant that is devoid of butter. Let me talk about this for a second. First of all, I don't believe it, so just right there, I think you're lying to me. Saying \"our policy is to not give our customers butter when they ask for it\" doesn't sound so good though, so I understand. The service was otherwise acceptable, if not terribly friendly.

If you ask me, and I know I'm only one small voice amid a chorus of four and five star reviews, this place is long on atmosphere and location and short on everything else. Expensive prices for the stingy portions of mediocre food. I don't even know if I'll go back for the pizza."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect from the happy hour meatball appetizer to the house salad, to the bruschetta, the the bolognase pasta!!!! Amazing flavor!"}
{"text":"I think most locals are familiar with this spot, but for me, being from Tempe this was quite the treat. With an awesome spacious patio, that truly has that garden, been here forever feel, it already deserved five stars. But the goodness didn't end with the scenery, food and wine were rare for Arizona dining and the staff is well trained and on top of their stuff. With my girlfriend previously owning and selling a restaurant, I am familiar with the work and dedication it takes to be successful. The owners certainly know what their doing and have created a big success with Cibo, would love to see one in Tempe."}
{"text":"Creamy hearted burrata just as everyone says: delicious. Quality balsamic and prosciutto crudo. Tomatoes are firm but marinated nicely. Found a Siciliano wine the people of Sicily actually drink: bonus points. Order a half/half pizza if you can't decide. Di Notte is indeed spicy and balanced by the Gorgonzola while the sausage on the Salsiccia is springy in texture and the crust beneath a bit limp (if you like crispy, this isn't for you---it's up to personal preference). Enjoyed the ambiance of the house and outdoor garden. And the stiff froth on my cappuccino convinced me the barista knows his/her stuff. Great service, too! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times. Not your typical pizza place. Pizzas are not your Pepperoni/mushroom type. All are creations of their chef. Have tried almost all of them and they are all exceptional. Wait staff friendly and service is fast."}
{"text":"I used to be able to walk here in 30 seconds from my old apartment.  I miss it so much. Listen to me... sit down and order yourself a margherita pie and a glass of wine, wait... I meant a bottle.. to yourself. Anyways, get the margherita pie one of their salads and a nutella crepe. Lucky lucky you."}
{"text":"It's so great to have a restaurant with a casual atmosphere and outstanding food. I love that I can walk in wearing my jeans and T-shirt but still feel like I'm getting a five-star experience. The appetizers are delicious and just enough to whet your appetite. The entrees are affordable, and so easy to share. Classic Italian meets Calgary!

The wait staff is friendly and knowledgable, and I've never had an issue with my table-side service there. There's a small problem with the bar service, as drinks take some time to arrive. I hope they're able to sort this out soon.

The patio is a gorgeous oasis in the middle of 17th Avenue. I hope this restaurant sticks around for some time to come."}
{"text":"I had the wild boar bacon pizza and it was delicous!! My friend had the gnocchi and it was average, nothing special! I would definitely go back for their 5$ pizza sometime! Service was good and food didn't take too long. Overall great place and really cool atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"Two of us went on a Friday night, so no surprise - there was a 45 minute wait...

But MAN - it was WELL worth it!!!

We started out with the Bruschetta, which was good (I especially loved the tomato bruschetta).  Then we split a pizza - also delish - I'm looking forward to returning and trying a different pizza every time...because all of them sounded SO GOOD.  But the real game winner was the CREPE at the end - with Nutella and Mascarpone - O.M.G. SO GOOD.

The atmosphere is fantastic, the wait staff is busy - but good, and the food is WELL worth any wait on a Friday night.  I will definitely be a \"frequent\" at this cute little pizzeria!!! :)"}
{"text":"this place has an up beat attitude i enjoyed the food at this place. many traditional Italian food which i enjoyed will definitely go out of the way to eat here"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. Quaint. So happy to have stumbled upon it. I had the couscous salad with grilled chicken on it and it was amazing. The bartender was fun. I'm looking forward to stopping by again."}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant and it was so worth it! Great staff, great atmosphere, and amazing food! The dessert was to die for! Will definitely be making this a regular go to spot!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed. The pizza crust on the Margherita I ordered was soggy. I have had better at Pizzeria Bianco or Humble Pie."}
{"text":"Like many have said the aumbience is amazing!!! Have been here multiple times and always enjoy the food and visit each time. Can get a little crowded during the busy dinner times or weekends but they will try and get you seated as soon as they can. 

Looking forward to the next visit!!"}
{"text":"I hate giving one star reviews, but alas, it happens occasionally.  And to be honest, I was leaving this place with two stars until the very last moment of this experience happened.

Pros:
Really nice, rustic decor
Clean (although it's new, so that's a good thing)
Reasonably priced wine ($5 glass of Prosecco was awesome)

Cons:
Disorganized staff (repeatedly had servers coming to the table asking if this is what we ordered, constantly interrupted conversation)
No gluten free options at all (couldn't even make a pasta into a risotto for me)
Waitress was a little to chummy for my liking (I like friendly service, but awkward jokes and standing around too long gets annoying)
Food prices are ok, not great (my $14 tuna salad was some greens with what looked like canned tuna thrown on top)
My friend ended up with green painters tape in her pasta (and no apology from management or anything about it. At least it was taken off the bill, after some argument between the waitress and shift manager)
To get your meal at the same time as your company you must order from the exact same menu list (pizza only or pasta only... my meal salad came 20 minutes before my friend's pasta)
After we paid our bill in cash and walked outside of the restaurant, the waitress came running out of the door and YELLED at us on 17th Ave that we didn't pay our full bill. She tried to embarrass us in public because she could not count - we left enough money plus a good tip, to which she replied that she was a moron and we could slap her hand for being bad.  Really?!  I've never been accused of not paying my bill before, and I certainly did not appreciate it. 

Overall, I do not plan to be back.  I know that new places have some kinks to work out, but the painters tape and accusation really sealed the deal for me."}
{"text":"Great place to buy a pistol..knowledgeable staff and friendly ...have done business before and will do again..the new location looks great"}
{"text":"I love the outdoor patio dining, and the food and service have always been top notch! It feels like you are out in the country somewhere and certainly not in the middle of a big city.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I went to this for date night. Such a cute and friendly enviroment! Highly recommend. However, we waited awhile for our waitress to reappear but she was super friendly and helpful! Loved this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome lil pizza spot. Casual & romantic. Pizza is great! Outdoor patio is quaint and relaxing with the musicians that play."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in one of the historic neighborhoods of Phoenix and it is just lovely.   We sat in the back and had a beautiful view of the city and the small garden area surrounding the restaurant.  (There is a small area just to the right of the entrance that has four tables in close proximity with stone floors and, I believe, brick walls.  The sound in that area is overwhelming so I would not sit there.)  I had a white, gluten free pizza, called Procida that was really delicious: mozzarella, prociutto crudo, asian pears, arugula and goat cheese.  My son had gluten free crust with pepperoni and sausage and he loved it and my husband had one of schiacciata sandwiches, maybe romagnaola - it seemed like it had sausage in it but I don't see that on the menu.  Everything was savory, warm, crusty, and really enjoyable to eat.  We had the fresca for desert and it was really like a party on a plate:  artistically folded crepe around ice cream and fruit, covered with multi colored pieces of fruit and whipped cream and also very pleasant to eat.  A really enjoyable dining experience!"}
{"text":"Been there once on a friday evening, remember food being okay but it was uncomfortably packed."}
{"text":"OMG!  Fantastic!  Delicious!  Gorgeous!  And bike-able!  Salad, wine, pizza, dessert, all way above average.  A true downtown gem."}
{"text":"The day we went there, we dint find any pizzas on their menu. We were kinda puzzled - isn't a pizzeria supposed to serve pizza? We're mostly vegetarians, so we ordered their caprese and vegetarian sandwich hot. was so good. will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Cibo is the best restaurant I've ever eaten at. It serves pizza with quality ingredients and excellent taste. If you like pizza then this place will make you very happy. Cibo is definitely worth going to."}
{"text":"We went to Cibo with friends who are Italian and love the place.  We weren't disappointed.  The food was stellar!  It's got great ambiance and I can't wait to go back for a nice dinner on the patio with my husband."}
{"text":"I actually like do like Cibo -but there is nothing that really sets it apart. 

The atmosphere is fun, the drinks are a decent price and the food is also decent -but not amazing. There's nothing I would complain about but then again or is nothing that I would rave about either -overall a decent place."}
{"text":"The best part of Cibo's by far is the warm, inviting ambiance. A great place for a romantic evening to begin. Also, the service is very friendly. The food is excellent. It is a quaint, romantic setting for two (as I shared on my visit) or a relaxing place to visit with friends after a long work week. Without a doubt, we'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere and quality food worth a stop in the area 
Outside seating a must
Pizza and salads are well proportioned"}
{"text":"Just love this place! My friend had pizza and I tryed pasta with mushrooms. Both was delicious, but they have the best desserts! If u would go there, you should try Caramel Walnut Tart. It ¬¥ s heaven in your mouth. :)"}
{"text":"Having seen a great reviews from here (Yelp), and what appeared to be very tasty pictures. I decided I'd take out my girlfriend to Cibo for a night out.

The pictures make the place look more luxurious than what I saw in person (see pic 3 of 83). The second we started to enter 5th Ave (the street it's on), the entire surroundings was seedy. 

When we were driving we saw a restaurant that we thought MIGHT have been Cibo, but it had gang signs written all on the front cement walls of the building and the side back walls were starting to peel. 

We thought \"this couldn't be it\". Sure enough, it was. They may have excellent food and great service, but I was hoping some of the ratings or reviews might've hinted towards the unsettling feeling of the area. My girlfriend and I felt unsafe leaving our nicer car in the area to enjoy a meal. 

My review: Photos and reviews say one thing, in person it feels a bit different. Locals of the area may love the spot, but I went to Scottsdale for the night instead."}
{"text":"Great food.   Service wasn't very attentive the day I went.  Needed to get up and go ask for 4 out of 5 plates to eat since we only had one after clearing our salads.  However, I would definitely recommend Cibo given how good the food is (spicy salami pizza was awesome) and give them a one time pass on the service that day."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Very quaint. We asked the server for pizza recommendations and was not disappointed. Just ask! Lemonade is delicious."}
{"text":"Good food, loved the pizza and salads.  I'm definitely coming back! Cute place and awesome staff.  Ask for Shane!  :)"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and it is was one of the better places to go when you are in downtown phx. 

Cibo is house that has been turned into a pizza restaurant, but they also serve other food. They are known for their pizza though. I didn't think their pizza was to die for, but it was quite good and a bit unique.

I actually asked for ranch (because ranch and pizza = awesome), and the server looked at me like I was stupid, so, keep that in mind. lol

The prices are fair, the atmosphere is awesome, and the live music was well done. 

This is a good place to take your signification other on a date!"}
{"text":"Ok, I am a pizza perfectionado.  grew up in NYC where great pizza is one almost every street corner.  As of late I've developed a taste for the true taste of Neapolitana style (real italian pizza)...  I have become quite expert in making my own neapolitana style pizza at home too, but when I do eat pizza out Cibo's is my very favorite.  It is set in a converted bungalow for a very homey atmosphere.  The proprietors Tony and Karen Martingilio and their son Michael Krasner are the most gracious and caring hosts I've ever encountered.  Guido Saccone is the Italian born and trained pizzaiola.  He crafts fine neapolitano pies my favorites are the margherita and sausage.  They also have great salads, antipasta, and at lunch time great sandwiches on homemade bread.  If you still have room, defintely try one of the crepe and Nutella deserts.  My favorite is the one with bananas.  Cibo's also has a carriage room suitable for private parties and can hold up to 60 people.  Also on Tuesday and Wednesday they are offering pasta specials homemade and handcrafted by Chef Guido.  So for a great all around dining experience you should check it out!  Tell em Lloyd sent ya!"}
{"text":"My first choice for pizza and bruschetta! And holy moly, their Nutella crepes for dessert will blow your mind."}
{"text":"I love the food and atmosphere , only reason i am giving it a 2 star is because of oneof the co-owners. he was v rude to my colleagues and I. we came in and were seatedto a table that apparently was reserved for someone else, but wehad no idea, we just followed the server. Later he comes to us and asked if we had reservation and when we said no he accused us of lying and telling the server that we did?!!! On the way out i stopped to assure him that we had no idea that it was taken and he was VERY rude!! Ilove the other co-owners, but this guy knows nothing about customer service or communication."}
{"text":"It's situated in a home from 1913 and has colored lights wrapped all around the trees.  You can either sit inside or on the gorgeous patio.  Brick oven pizza and cheese plates offered here and it's definitely a place for a cool date."}
{"text":"Amazing! We went for my birthday and went based off of Yelp reviews. It was so delicious; everyone in our party loved it! We got both pastas and a white pizza - we ate until we couldn't anymore. Ross was our server and he was very knowledgable and friendly! Finally we had a marcon and nutella crepe- so so good. Honestly, I can't say enough about this place. Go check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Was a great spot that I was glad I stopped in to grab a quick bite while in Phoenix on business. Definitely will be back if I'm ever in the area!"}
{"text":"I love Cibo. I love going with my bf here. It is pretty much located inside a historic house so it is very small. It is perfect for a romantic close date. 

The food is good. It is pretty much the same kind of style as Pizzeria Bianco. Although I might argue that Bianco is better. 

The salad is boring and dry. I I dislike salad that is a plate full of lettuce. I need more in it...shoot give me a tomato atleast !!! 

The crepes for dessert are delish. I would go there just for pizza and crepes."}
{"text":"Wonderful outdoor patio atmosphere. Good appetizers and wine selection. Nice, quiet, romantic evening dinner location."}
{"text":"What a very pleasant surprise.  This is a converted house in the middle of a quiet residential neighborhood turned into a pizza place.  Tables are scattered inside and on the front patio, where there were beautiful white lights and live music.  Red sauce pizza was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite find on yelp!  Amazing food, great little place, will be back every time we go downtown for an event. The pizza and desserts were the BEST. Loved everything about this place, a must try restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow! Best all around for food and a great environment. The specials are worth trying for something unique. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cibo has a really Great patio. I've been here numerous times. Their prosciutto and arugula pizza is delicious - the Nutella crepe for dessert is absolutely delicious! I do recommend this place all the way.  A lot of people will say this place rivals Pizzeria Bianco - I suppose that it true.  Different flavor than what Chris Bianco is turning out. And Cibo has a much larger pizza selection- which doesn't make that necessarily better or worse. They just do. 

The one and only thing that I don't love about this place- their beer selection is lacking. I would love to see them
Offer more beers. As a local restaurant, Why not offer some Local brewery stuff - 4 peaks, SanTan? 
if you're into wine- their wine selection is extensive!  I'm just not a big wine drinker when I go out to eat."}
{"text":"I was brought here by someone that said this was the \"best pizza in Phoenix\" in her opinion. I was super impressed by the bungalow, we were seated right by a window with a nice view of the yard and downtown. We just happened to arrive as a couple was leaving, which worked out great since there were no available tables. This place fills up quick and - from what i hear - usually has a line out the door of people waiting for a table. We started off with a pear salad, which was arugala tossed with sliced pears, pecorino cheese, honey, toasted almonds and drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette. It was fresh, clean and heavenly. For the pizza we ordered the Di Notte - fontina, pecorino, gorgonzola and mozzerella cheese topped with spicy salami. It was some of the best pizza that I have ever in my life had. The light char on the bottom of the pizza (which reminded me of the exterior of a marshmallow when you hold it over a campfire) just set it off. The salty and strong mix of cheeses paired with the spiciness of the salami just made each bite explode. I can see why this place is always so busy. Just delicious!"}
{"text":"So wonderful. The best place to get gluten free pizza in Phoenix. The patio is excellent. Live music on Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"Yum! Delicious tasting pizza, a wonderful atmosphere, and oh those  Nutella crepes are devine!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is great.  Excellent pizza, excellent antipasti, excellent salads, excellent desserts."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there last night.  Very nice ambiance.  We had the  cheese, basil, and tomato pizza and the sausage pizza.  The fresh mozzarella was fantastic and the pizzas were great.  I didn't give it five stars because I like my pizza  with a little more tomato.  The other reason, but like the first one it is  a bit subjective, is that the menu selections for dinner are limited - basically pizza.  It was good  enough that I  definitely plan to have lunch one day next week  and try some  of the dishes  that others have raved about!"}
{"text":"Cibo never disappoints!  Tartu Fatta (spelling?), love, love!  A great date spot or even if you want to go alone for a nice dinner and sit at the bar.  Very cozy, comfortable.  Nice wine selection and you can't go wrong with any of the food.  The homemade mozzarella is delish!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy both the food and the atmosphere at Cibo, especially on the patio. It's a romantic little spot and a great place to take a date. They have delicious brick oven pizzas. I love the Margherita especially. It it very reasonably priced. The parking is rough and I would suggest procuring reservations well in advanced because it's so popular."}
{"text":"GREAT Experience! I went with a group of 5 during dinner on a weeknight. We were promptly seated, service was friendly, and the prices are competitive. The atmosphere is very cozy and quaint. The calzones are HUGE. I ordered one for myself, and it could easily feed two people. The pizza and cappuccino are also delicious. My friend is full-blooded second generation Italian, and she said this was as close to authentic as it gets! 
Overall, it was a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. I'm not typically a salad kind of guy but this place is great. Love the atmosphere, love the food (more than just salads... also pizza, sandwiches, and delicious desserts)."}
{"text":"Really cute place. Very relaxing. The waitress? Very unpleasant. She didn't bother to introduce herself and just went right to \"what do you guy want for a drink?\" We explained to her that it was our first time there and she seemed to be annoyed we didn't know what to order. We asked for recommendations and she basically shrugged her shoulders and did not help at all. I understand people have bad days but this woman should have just stayed home. Ruined our first time there."}
{"text":"I tried Cibo because of all the reviews on Yelp and because I don't want to wait in a long line for Pizzeria Bianco which I keep hearing about.  I am not a very patient person and 3 hours for a pizza is pushing it, even though I love pizza it is one of my favorite foods.  Back to Cibo it was a little hard to find at night because it is dimly lit.  Which is nice and romantic when you get inside, especially since it was my girlfriend and I.  It is a located in a re purposed bungalow house, which is great to help keep part of downtown's history.  

We ordered the Anitpasto Speciale which was really good although the roasted red peppers were overly done and mushy.  We had trouble picking a pizza and the waiter was very helpful.  He told us that they were individual sized pizzas but since we split the Antipasto platter we could share one.  We ordered the Salsicca pizza which came with tomato sauce, sausage and mozzarella. It was a really good thin crust pizza.  The crust was crispy and had a little char it actually tasted like a fresh baked tortilla (like mom used to make).  

We did have room for desert so we each ordered our own crepe, thinking they would be a single rolled crepe.  We should of shared one because they were as big as the pizza.  I ordered the Nutella and mascarpone crepe which was good.  My girlfriend ordered the Nutella and banana crepe which was delicious.

We definitely will be back again for another romantic dinner.  Oven fired pizzas, fresh and imported Italian ingredients and reasonably priced.  It can't be beat."}
{"text":"It was a tad bit hard to find, BUT completely worth it! Went on a Friday night- pretty crowded but we were seated quickly. The food was delicious. Great spot for a date or brunch w your friends, etc. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went out to dinner with some friends here for the first time. I loved it. They had live music outside, and heaters because it was cool. I love the option of outdoor seating. We got a cozy table in the back, everyone ordered tea. I got the indian spicy tea, which I don't know why because I only like it when Indians make it. I got the special and boy was it awesome. My friends got the capricolla and they loved it. I'm really excited to go back and try more pizzas :)"}
{"text":"This place has the best to offer eh? meh.   

Date night around 8pm on a Saturday?
1) waited 10 minutes at the bar for a beer that was served half cold. Meh. 
2) lady has a pesto salad, could not taste the pesto and nuts very well. Meh. 
3) I had the genova pizza which left a lot to be desired. Overwhelmed by too much cheese and an over-olive-oiled crust, I barely tasted the potato. Meh.
4) banana nutella crepe was excellent however. 
5) service? Again, meh. Not terrible, not great. 

If you come in with 3* hopes, you will get a 3* return, maybe 4* if they are not going during peak hours"}
{"text":"Great happy hour place, they currently have 5 dollar pizzas and 4 dollar beers. The staff is accommodating and the food is always fresh."}
{"text":"Cibo is my absolute favorite urban pizza place! I love the set up and the romantic atmosphere in here! Food and service are always amazing! I highly recommend this place! ;)"}
{"text":"I think their pizza is overrated and it always has burned crust.  Supposedly, that comes with wood fired pizza. I'd rather have not-wood-fired pizza then.  Thanks."}
{"text":"Ate here again last week and I think the food was even better than the first time I was there. Great salads and pizza."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  I've had my birthday here twice in the last 5 years, and they have been able to accommodate large groups (up to 20s).  Their patio is super cute and great in the fall and spring time.  My favorite pizza is the Di Notte.  Cute atmosphere combined with good food = one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  Worth the drive to downtown!"}
{"text":"Took my best friend to Cibo for a belated birthday lunch back in July. She basically has the pallet of a tube sock and doesn't venture far out of meat and potatoes style food. We had the Farfalle and Gnocchi for our meals. OMG so good. Perfect amount of pesto on the farfalle, noodles cooked perfectly and just the right amount of cheese. She never had gnocchi before and fell in love with it. 

We were sitting on the patio and happened to see the guy from \" dragons den\" which was pretty cool. The patio is awesome, like a little oasis in the middle of 17th. And its nicely fenced off so the people on the street don't bug you. 

One thing she really enjoyed was when we got Q water the server informed us that for every bottle sold 2$ of it goes to the Ronald McDonald house. We have a mutual friend that has a sick kid so she was over the moon about it. 

For dessert we had the 3 sorbets and the ricotta balls with 2 dipping sauces. Amazing.  There should be 4 ricotta balls though, cause that would have stopped us from fighting over the last one. 

I like Cibo a lot, will be back when I want really good pasta and the craving strikes me."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Food is good.  Service is great and reasonable prices.  The patio area is great specially from Fall to Spring.  Inside is kind of loud and on weekends the wait can be long so I recommend to call in advance."}
{"text":"Cibo has a great space, very wide open, nice decor, and it immediately makes you feel welcome. The wait staff and service here have been consistently good, and the food goes from very good to OMFG amazing. It is not super expensive, actually well priced for Calgary, and I always enjoy eating here. I'm already looking forward to my next visit. This is a great place to relax and share a meal with friends."}
{"text":"Very romantic spot. Inside and outside seating, but outside is beautiful during spring. My wife and I love Cibo. The pizza is delicious and comes in perfect sizes. The Crepes are to die for. The prices are not bad. We spent about 50 bucks for the both of us, but we left stuffed!"}
{"text":"mmm... Cibo. 

Historic house turned best pizza... EVER. Charming and lovely, Cibo is a great first date place, appropriate for business mingling, and even the kind of place you'd want to take your mom to. 

You're paying for quality here, so go big or go home. My average ticket is about $30 per person - including wine and yes, it's totally worth it.

The space is quaint, so if you've got a large party, make reservations and if you're not sure what to order, ask your server, they're excellent!"}
{"text":"We were referred to this place from some friends and found it to be exceptionally charming. The atmosphere was delightful and our kids (and us) loved the patio. And the pizza was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great food. I had the Italian sausage sandwich with a salad and it was great. Unique seating options, as you can sit inside or out."}
{"text":"So good from beginning to end.  The Margarita Pizza was SO good.  Best pizza I have had here so far. The fruit and crepe was a great finish to a great dinner!"}
{"text":"I've been to Cibo at least 10 times over the past year and it never disappoints. The restaurant is nice with a good atmosphere but can be a bit noisy. On weekends for dinner you definitely should get a reservation. Service is always friendly and quick!

Caesars here are excellent, as is the pizza - I think I've had every one and liked them all. Pretty disappointed they changed the menu and got rid of some favorites like the eggplant dip, and do I really want to pay $7 for roasted nuts? But overall the appetizers are good as well, especially the deviled eggs (although they are kind of ugly with runny yolks). The rest of the food is excellent, and the pastas always taste fresh and delicious. Good price as well. I'll definitely keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"When I Came here with my family for dinner, The atmoshere grabbed me immeadiately. The food was captivating and infused with classic italian flavors that have me coming back for more. nice work."}
{"text":"Food was ok, agree with the somewhat overpriced.

What prompted me to write a review was the service.

Good  service is not 
-telling the table all about your personal life
-telling people what they should order
-lingering for way too long. Like awkwardly too long.

It wasn't just one person so I think it must be something they tell their servers to do. It's awkward for everyone involved."}
{"text":"Love their wine selection!!! Outstanding prices. It is a small place but their flavors are phenomenal. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The patio at Cibo is so perfect that I haven't wanted to try eating inside.  I thought the interior couldn't possibly measure up to the allure of the patio.  Well, I was wrong.  The inside may be a little noisier, but it's still charming and a great place to grab a bite.
   
Cibo is a one-stop restaurant that not only has great pizza, but also fantastic salads and desserts.   And cheap wine.  I'm partial to the margherita pizza with the fresh basil followed by a nutella and strawberry crepe.  That way, I can say I've had at least one serving of fruits and vegetables for the day.   Add a glass of wine for heart health and it's a healthy and delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Cibo is a great place for nice dinner!! Compared to Bianco, Cibo has a more local and intimate vibe. Also, they have a bigger selection of pizzas and unlike Bianco, they have other traditional italian entrees (They have homemade pasta on some nights!). When I went it was busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table. The servers are dressed really casually, but a lot of the people eating were dressed up. It's kind of a casual place but if you dressed up you wouldn't feel weird. 

Bianco is the place to try for pizza in Phoenix, of course, but Cibo is just as good...especially if you are looking for something other than pizza too!"}
{"text":"Cute little old house setting is appealing but it doesn't need to be so noisy or so dark. Place was very busy which is fine if there's enough staff but the help was overworked. They were all super nice and very efficient. The person who does the hiring has a good eye for talent. 

Focaccia appetizer was just okay. Bland even with the side of balsamic vinegar. 

Pizza...  Excellent crust!  But again, bland. Mine had potatoes which I like on pizza but usually they are applied in thin slices. These were big chunks which made for a pasty, starchy texture. 

Nutella crepe dessert was slimy. I felt the problem was an undercooked crepe. Maybe the kitchen is also too dark.

I wouldn't go back. Plenty of other good Neapolitan style pizza joints in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Food, service and atmosphere are all beyond compare at this wonderful neighborhood eatery. 

In my few dozen visits to Cibo I have always had a wonderful experience. The staff are very friendly and attentive. The food is always amazing - appetizer to dessert. 

Customer for life."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. My wife and I go every chance we get. The sausage and potato pizza is the absolute best."}
{"text":"the food was ok.
Make sure the hostess see you if you decide to wait for a table. We waited for 90 min for a table while couples after us showed up. I was behind one of the bushes and I dont usually say anything but it got frustrating after a while. Food was ok. Servers were nice and prompt."}
{"text":"If you're in downtown Phoenix and you want some Neapolitan style pizza, this is the place to go. The Diavola pizza is very tasty with a beer. Although their beer selection is sub par compared to places like Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere and amazing food. Very busy, even on a Thursday night, which is always a good sign.  The historic location and building were my favorite part. I can't wait to go back on a night that they serve the pasta."}
{"text":"Best place for lunch or dinner downtown, especially when it cools off to sit outside. The M&M (PB&J) is a must try, good to split as an appetizer or dessert. I Also recommend the eggplant parm panini.  For those tea fans, the iced tea is an unsweetened black passion fruit."}
{"text":"I went here to have breakfast with a friend for the first time.  The service was very good and the waitress checked on us more than one time.  It is in a off location, doesnt stand out- look out for a house at the corner of the street.  It has indoor and outdoor sitting- which would be nice for the fall but not in the summer.  The decor inside was fitting  and menu was very simple.  We sat a rickety table, so that might need a look at, otherwise I would like to go here again for lunch or even dinner."}
{"text":"Upon recommendation from a local I visited Cibo and was delighted. The wait time was fast, the decor and ambiance are cozy and relaxing, and the food is excellent. The paintings on the inside walls are ostensibly done by the owner and are for sale. The artist/restaurateur introduced himself to us as I was ogling the likenesses of David Robert Jones (David Bowie), Prince Rogers Nelson (Prince) and Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. (Muhammed Ali). Honestly would've preferred a painting of Will Smith up there, but not gonna dock any stars.

Bear in mind there's no full bar and no beer on tap, so it's a few bottles of beer, wine and limited mixed drinks. But as long as Mama Gorbachenko get her buzz on she all good!"}
{"text":"I am such a pizza lover, so I am a big fan of this place, I have tried everything. any kind of pizza. Everything was great. Sometimes service is slow. Anyways, it is one of my favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"We were headed to The Vig and decided to try this place out instead. Amazing little restaurant in an old house. Great atmosphere, amazing food, and fairly reasonable prices. We had the Mele Salad and the Diavola Pizza... SUPERB!! Service was a little slow for not being busy, but we will definitely be back. Definitely worth a shot!!"}
{"text":"When my husband and I were looking for a place to host our casual rehearsal dinner in May, we knew we wanted to take our small wedding party to one of our favorite local spots. Cibo came to mind, and we discovered their wonderful, private carriage house. 

It's located right behind the restaurant, and it's perfect for groups of 30 or less. It's everything you love about Cibo--delicious food, attentive service and cute ambiance. Inside, the Carriage House features exposed brick walls, wine racks, a cool bar and art created by local artists. Outside, there's a private patio with string lighting, cozy seating and a fire pit. Oh, and there's a private bathroom, too. 

Michelle at Cibo helped us coordinate the evening, and she was super helpful. We chose a menu that featured an antipasti, a couple of delicious pizzas of our choice, and a sweet nutella crepe for desert. The food, of course, was amazing, and the service was even better. We had a dedicated bartender/server for our group of 20. She was awesome, and made sure our wine glasses were never empty, which was critical for our group of lushes. 

The cost was also really reasonable. There was a fee of $50 to reserve the private carriage house, and the cost per person was a steal. The in-laws were hosting the dinner, so I don't know the exact price, but I think the food was around $25-30/pp, excluding beer and wine. 

If you're looking for a casual place to hold your next private event, I highly encourage you to check out Cibo's carriage house. So, so awesome."}
{"text":"Went here with a large group for dinner on a Saturday night. They were very accommodating and served us all around the same time. I ordered the chicken salad which was fantastic! I portion is very large - I had enough to take home for lunch the next day. The only reason I give it 4/5 stars instead of 5 is that I didn't find the pizza that great. I tried a few bites of someone else's and it was too greasy and not crisp enough for my liking. Otherwise, I do plan to go back to Cibo to enjoy one of their drink/wine specials !"}
{"text":"Food is great..their burrata could be the best I have had in the state of Arizona. Great ambiance especially on the patio for this time of year, ride the bike up, chill on the patio with a glass of vino, and presto you are relaxed. I dropped 2 stars because honestly the last two times I have been there the service was downright slllllloooooooowwwwwwww....I don't like putting minutes on the time that I was waiting because honestly (and let's be honest) you can pretty much bet that if you are thinking \"I was waiting 20 minutes for a glass of wine\" it was probably about 7 if that, however it felt like 45 minutes and that is considering that the ambiance was amazing and I had great company. Love the food, love the outdoor patio, but I probably could have made wine at my table faster."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have had in Arizona hands down - it is even better than NYC pizza, in my opinion. After trying multiple different pizzas I have come to the conclusion they are amazing and when you can't decide which of two you want from the menu, they have no problem letting you do half and half which is great. They will even let you mix the sauce pizzas with the white pizzas.

However, it isn't just pizza that is outstanding here. They have some of the best menu items I have tried anywhere, generally speaking. One of the best being the most tasty cheese plate I've ever had.

My suggestion is that if you have not yet been here that you stop whatever you are doing and head there now - your stomach will thank you."}
{"text":"had the 'mussels ' great! the 'roasted beet salad' very good, for dinner Penne pasta cibo 21, this is one of the best pasta dishs i have had in yr's, the sausage was outstanding and the sauce was to die for, would order this again !! very nice looking in side , the staff were friendly and very helpful, its one of those small places that serve big time food and you end up going back every week! went with 7 people and we all were very happy"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Cibo. The first time we were here we had  the margarita pizza and veggie pizza. Both were good, we enjoyed the crust of both pizza's. On our second visit we decided to try the  sandwiches. I had the  Caprese and my husband had the Porcellino both with the truffle fries. My sandwich was good. I really enjoyed the \"bread\". My husband also felt the same about his meal. We were both disappointed with the truffle fries. We have had good truffle fries at other restaurants and these were not even close. We ended our meal with a delicious crepe with fruit, yummy. Service was good."}
{"text":"Disappointing.

The service and atmosphere was good. The food on the other hand was nothing to write home about. My pasta dish was fairly blend, and the asparagus was undercooked. My girlfriend's veal was tough and the portion was exceptionally small. For the price  I would expect the quality of a Piccolo Fiorno or Girasole's. Cibo is a way-distant third in comparison to those two. With all the Italian options in Pittsburgh I'd be surprised if Cibo can continue charging what they do without upping the quality.

All-in-all though, this place is fairly new, like all new establishments I'm sure there's a few kinks to work out. I'll probably give this place another chance, though first impression was disappointing."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was AMAZING. Also, the vibe of the place is very fun. Reminded us of Flagstaff. And considering the quality of food, the prices were reasonable. We were very pleased!"}
{"text":"Great gourmet pizzas, awesome salads, and a cute place suitable for a variety of occasions, be it a date, dinner with the gals, birthday get-together, or a family outing. One of my favorites!"}
{"text":"5 stars for atmosphere, food, and the Nutella and strawberry crepe. Spent Friday the 13th here for V-day and it was great. The patio ambiance and the guitarist were spectacular. I LOVE me some Cibo!"}
{"text":"Cibo - what a beautiful setting. I love the patio, and love that it's in an awesome historic house in downtown Phoenix.

The pizza is very good and the spicy salami is the icing on the pie! Good crust, good cheese, good sauce. And I've never had bad service.

My one complaint is that the salads aren't all that - they're passable, but the salads at Forno 301 and even Grazie in Scottsdale are much better. If you improve on these, you'll have a really good thing going.

I always try to pass it up, but never can - the nutella and mascarpone crepe. DELICIOUS!

It's a great overall experience for date night, family meal, afternoon snack and wine on a beautiful patio - keep it up Cibo!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best gluten-free pizza in my 6 years of gluten free."}
{"text":"GAWD, can't say enough good things! LOVE this place. GREAT pizza, good desserts, great service!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty picky about my pizza and have extremely high expectations (LGO being my favorite in the Valley), but I can't say enough great things about this place...
Amazing date spot, delicious fresh food, kind service, and adorable atmosphere. The pizza is that italian still, thin, homemade style crust with fresh toppings in a wood-fire brick oven. The pasta is delicious as well. 
It can get pretty busy during prime weekend dinner hours so I recommend a nice mid-week visit. 
Love, love."}
{"text":"This is -hands down- the best pizza place in town. We take people here, every time we want to empress them with a  mind blowing pizza. I have no other pizza joint that I like in town, but Cibo's."}
{"text":"so I started cosmetology school and each month we can go to the art museum and get extra hours for school and we now have officially incorporated cibo into our monthly art museum visit for school.  WE LOVE CIBO!!!!!  Everytime we go in everyone is amazing.  This last time in particular was just amazing, we got Matt as our server-he's amazing, he takes such great care of his guests and I was so excited to get to have him again, he's like a celebrity and doesn't eve know it.  Now that the weather is cooling off we sat outside, drank some wine, enjoyed lots of yummy food.  I love the funghi with salami and one of my friends got the calzone... bombdotcom :) of course we got dessert and again mind blowing!  See you all next month for some amazing food, service and atmosphere.  xxoo"}
{"text":"Seriously AMAZING! I hate to work something up, only to have your expectations come crashing down but this is THE best pizza I've ever had, hands down (and yes, even better than Bianco's)! The service was awesome even on an extremely busy night, the prices were reasonable and the location may be small but has so much charm to wow you off your feet. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Checked in last week for an after holiday dinner. As in, now that the holidays are over, we actually have time to spend with each other. We had the beef sugo, with the gnudi, and the the monkfish special. I had been expecting a red sauce, and was a little disappointed until I tasted my entree. Delicious and savory. A red sauce would have distracted from the flavors. My fault that I didn't know exactly what I was getting. The monkfish with fennel and butternut squash was nothing short of amazing. 

Again, a nice place to bring a bottle and have a quiet evening. Again, some of the younger front of house staff seem to be new at what they are doing. It may be picky, but I dislike having servers refer to a table as 'guys.' If you're waiting on the Penguins, I think you can get away with 'guys.' Otherwise, it's not really appropriate to the setting.

I was tempted to stay for dessert, but decided to check out the scotch list across the street at The Map Room. So, that's a nice option to consider, and part of what makes the Regent Square business area something special. Cibo is an important part of the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Nice relaxed atmosphere, attentive service, decent food.  I had a fairly basic pasta, which is probably not indicative of the overall quality of the menu; my friend ordered seafood, and she enjoyed it.  It was not overcrowded when we were there (on a Friday night), so it was fairly quiet.  We had no complaints.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to avoid it either."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very laid back and friendly. The food was very good. They used very fresh ingredients which gets a gold star in my book."}
{"text":"Okay, first off, Rachel was flippin' awesome!! My buddy and I had second thoughts about this place after we had ordered our beers so we talked to Rachel about it and told her that we didn't quite understand the menu. She explained to us how the menu worked and recommended a few items. Rachel was amazing! Have I said that enough times already?! No!! She was the only reason why we stuck around and ordered so much food, it was crazy! Rachel was courteous, patient, and understanding! I, myself being in the service industry, really appreciated the effort Rachel put in to dealing with difficult customers like us. I mean, seriously, we're always very indecisive! I would come back to Cibo's every time I'm in Calgary only because Rachel works here! Thanks Rachel!!

I guess everyone wants to know how the food was. It was awesome! We got the Rotisserie Chicken with Blood Orange glaze and the Beef Sirloin, then to finish off, we had the most delicious Tiramisu I've had in a long long time! Tiramisu is highly recommended!

Great service and food overall!"}
{"text":"La Noce and the Omero Salad are to die for. Great chill place to have either a relax everyday dinner or romantic."}
{"text":"Tried this place three times now and have been blown away every time. I HAVE to order the il tagliere every time (soooo good). I also love love love the di notte pizza, but I add arugula. This past to ewe had our kids with us and we ordered the Blanca pasta off the kids menu and it was amazing. I think I will bring the kids again just so I can order it. The wait staff has always been gracious as well (which is necessary when dining with a 3 and 1 year old!) Love this place!

Update 7/28/17: continues to be one of the TOP restaurants in the valley. Celebrated my husband's birthday there last night and Megan provided exceptional service for our special date night. The food, as always, was an amazing experience. The fresh pasta with black truffle special was on point. Also the dolce vita white pizza will now be my new go-to entree. Exceptional. Call ahead if you want to know pasta specials, as their selection has changed, but they continue to impress."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite local place for very long time.  Not just my favorite pizza place but favorite restaurant.  Every time we go, we have our small appetizer or salad, wine and pizza.  It's all delicious! 
In my opinion, you cannot go wrong with any item on the menu.  Whether seated inside amongst the electric decor or amongst the trees, Cibo is always enjoyable quite romantic place!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite downtown Phoenix restaurant. Unique, intimate atmosphere, friendly service, and delicious food, especially the pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza here is definitely not the best I've ever had, but it's the best in Phoenix, up there with Otto's Pizza in  Tempe and La Grande in Scottsdale. That being said, Cibo has them both beat in terms of atmosphere, sitting outside during a nice sunset is a great setting for a meal. Definitely an intimate place for smaller"}
{"text":"We went to Cibo last night, our service was awful!! We were seated and waited ten minutes for a glass of water. Many of the tables around us were seated after us and received their food before us. Our waitress was just beyond rude, and would not even look at us when taking our order. 

The food was only ok, and the worst part of it was four of us got food poising! 

I have heard great things about Cibo, but our experience was horrible!!!! I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a couple girl friends and it was amazing! They were a little busy but we weren't in any rush. Great pizza and drinks, very romantic cozy area"}
{"text":"Okay, I know there are many pizza places that claim to be the best, but seriously this is the best pizza, closest to the types served in Italy.

My wife and I had our honeymoon in Italy this past summer and had pizza everywhere we went.  The pizza in Italy is a little different from what most Americans are used to, as they aren't as heavy on the red sauce, and they usually incorporate more exotic and fresh ingredients.

Now upon our journey to Italy we ended up in Naples (birthplace of Pizza), and couldn't believe how identical the pizza there (Naples) was to Cibo, delicious may I add!

So if you've never been to Italy and want something extremely similar in style and taste, then you'll love Cibo. The atmosphere is great, the place is a little cozy and expect to wait 45 minutes depending on when you decide to go."}
{"text":"Delizioso! Ate here with friends on the fourteenth anniversary of my 29th birthday (I'll let you do the math!) and had a splendid, splendid meal! The service was attentive, the food was delish and I want to go back -- NOW! I'm not much of a meat eater so had the Quattro Formaggi Pizze -- but have to admit the other meat-laden pies were looking mighty good. Complimentary Nutella crepe on your birthday (money)! And I would highly recommend the Bellinis! Evviva! (Sorry, practicing my Italian!)"}
{"text":"After a glut of pizza watching on food network, I was on the hunt for some good thin crust pizza. Being in my third trimester, however, I wanted to avoid the hour long waits I was reading about all the pizza places in town, and decided to go during lunch time. Unfortunately, I didn't do my research enough and didn't realize that Cibo does NOT serve pizza during lunch, only sandwiches; pizza is only at dinner time. 

After the initial disappointment, and being too hungry to go somewhere else, we decided to go ahead and order. For a weekday lunch, it was still pretty busy. No wait, but only seats available were at the bar, and just 2 seats were available. However it looked like the turnover was quick. Service by the guy at the bar was relatively quick and very friendly, but he was running around like crazy taking care of both customers at the bar and at tables. 

All the sandwiches are made with the fresh baked focaccia made in the brick ovens. Very fresh and tasty. Not oily at all like a lot of other focaccia's I've had. Good texture, chewy without being tough. There's a choice of cold vs hot sandwiches, my husband and I both got hot ones...I got a mozzarella, tomato and pesto i think? Whatever it was, it was good. My husband got the pulled pork buffalo style...He enjoyed it...I'm not a big fan of buffalo style sauce so I can't really comment on it. You have a choice of side salad or fruit salad witht he sandwhiches, or chips, which we didn't get. The salad was fine, fresh, well dressed. The fruit salad was a bit of a surprise...more of a parfait w/ some thick whipped cream and granola on top. It was good, but being lactose intolerant, it came as a bit of a surprise, so just a warning for those who can't tolerate dairy, or thought they were being healthy by ordering a fruit salad. 

Anyways, m/b I'll make to try the pizza one day...but the sandwiches were still worth the visit."}
{"text":"Spaghetti and meatballs were bland. When first served the meatballs were raw in the middle. Stomach upset today. Was a 30 minute gap between them bringing out the entires for the 2 other people in our group. Nothing comped on the bill."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in Phoenix and wonderful ambience too! Every pizza I've had is delicious, and lots of vegetarian friendly options."}
{"text":"This place is super cute, it reminds me of Casey Moore's in Tempe. The food was pretty good but not amazing like I was hoping for. My friend told me that it was the next best thing to pizzeria bianco, so after hearing all the raves about that place (but I still unfortunely havn't been myself) I was certain the Cibo would be really good. 
Everything in there is nice and cute, the kitchen, design, even the bread they serve before the meal. But my firends and I spit their house salad which sounded really good to me, but the greens were really stemy. 
Then we got a pizza and I loved the crispy crust, but it wasn't anything to die for. But then again my friend took it upon herself to add garlic to it, which I think might have ruined it, so I defintiey want to give this place another try and eat a pizza how it comes."}
{"text":"Attended a privately hosted event and could not be happier w the service and food. So... my previous rating is rewritten. Though not the full 5 cause I still have restaurant service nightmares. But hey, takes some pretty epic service to go from a 1 to a 4. E.g. in wrapping up the food they individually boxed and labelled each box. Pizza was, as per my first visit, on point. Especially the sweet one w pear and honey."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! A real hidden gem. I love the great variety of the menu. Went for a freinds birthday dinner, the 3 pair bruschetta was so good every one of the 3 different toppings were excellent. For dinner I had the pomodoro fresco... Amazing! The wait staff was very nice and helpful. Recommend this place to anyone perfect for parties, date nights, casual meeting with friends."}
{"text":"Finally, I got to try the pizza that everyone has been raving about!  

Being a pizza snob, I take my pizza seriously!

I had been to Cibo long ago but was discouraged by the fact that this place, which labels itself as a \"pizzeria\" did not serve any pizza during lunch.  A fact that was never mentioned over the years by all the rave reviews, in advertisements, or even on their own website.  I'm sure many others experienced the disappointment of finding this out on their first visit.  

The news that they had recently started to serve pizza options for lunch prompted me to finally return.  Though I should note that (at this point) your pizza choices are limited to only four selections, nothing like the nearly two dozen options available at dinner.

Cibo's pizza harkens back to the traditional pizza from Napoli, however it falls short of accomplishing this feat, and for those who have experienced \"authentic\" pizza, this comes across as a failed attempt.  However, it is definitely a step up from average pizza place.

I ordered the Salsiccia Pizza, which has tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and sausage. The crust is made from \"00\" flour, cooked in a fired oven and is soft and appealing, however it fails at the trademark chewiness, and is lacking any type of character development.  In other words...bland.

I was very happy with the fresh mozzarella and more so with the real fennel sausage, however the tomatoes lacked any brightness, and were lost under the other, more aggressive flavors.

My pizza was barely seven inches, and was cut in eight pieces, which made the slices too narrow to handle the toppings, so attempting to eat this by hand resulted in more toppings returning to the plate, than were entering my mouth.

Cibo resides in a rehabilitated home on 5th Avenue, which is small, but inviting.  They have a small lot, and on street parking is shared with other businesses and residences, so parking can be an issue.

Overall the pizza is decent, however, why would I bother to return here when I can get much better (and larger) pizza at either of the two \"Certified\" authentic pizzerias that are just blocks away?"}
{"text":"Friendly, quick service. Delicious gnocchi, pineapple pizza, and sangria. Very consistent from the kitchen. When there was a wait for a table, the hostess didn't offer options such as sitting at the bar until we suggested it. However, if you do get on the waiting list, they'll text you when your table is ready."}
{"text":"Haven't even been inside this place yet, but we moved to the Encanto area and with nothing in our fridge opted to order some pizza. Thinking it would take a while we called ahead to order take out, and they said it'd be ready in 10 minutes! Amazing for a place that I've heard so much about and figured would have a long wait.

The menu has some delish choices and the Tartufata pizza bianche is beyond amazing. As a picky pizza eater, this is now my new favorite place - and one that my fiance now prefers over the likes of Bianco's. 

A MUST try if you haven't been."}
{"text":"Recent experiences have made me upgrade my review to 5 stars.  The food is consistently excellent, the bread is better than it was in the beginning, and the service is truly friendly and efficient.   AND, I just learned that they may be staying open all day and extending hours.   YAY!"}
{"text":"One of the best Pizza joints in town! It is the \"poor man's\" Bianco without the 3 hr wait. I not saying it is the best pizza in the country but it is far better than most. The antipasto is excellent and all the ingredients are fresh. The setting it quite nice (inside a converted home) and its location keeps it from being totally overrun with tourists."}
{"text":"We decided to have a girls night out starting with dinner at Cibo. One of my girlfriend's has raved about the food so I was excited to try it out.

Upon arriving, I couldn't help but notice the overpowering stench of an old barn - wet hay and manure included. Not the kind of smell you want when trying to entice people to eat. Even our question to our server about it was left unanswered  . . .

Everything on the menu is set to share, so we were ready to dig in. For starters we ordered the date salad, mixed greens salad, arancini (which was balls of risotto deep fried - YUM!), lamb meatballs and grilled scallops.

I normally don't order salad as a starter so initially I wasn't thrilled about getting mixed greens. But the pistachios, raisins and the balsamic vinaigrette made it a really tasty dish! 

For our mains we ordered 3 pizzas - the wild boar bacon, pineapple and mushroom. Each were delicious in their own way. As much as I love bacon, I'd have to say my favorite of the 3 was the pineapple. The crumbed prosciutto, sprinkles of chili peppers (which gave it a nice kick) and fresh arugula was a perfect melody of flavors. 

Dessert we shared the dark chocolate date budini (which was generous sized brownie cake) and the Nutella calzone.

I would give the food, service and experience 5 stars, but I'm still reminded of the wretched barn smell and that's why I'm giving it a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Food was great but service was not. We (two adults) were seated intimately between three families with children - maybe could have advised us we'd be eating in the kid zone? Food was relatively fast but the server forgot to send our dessert order so it was late and was very slow to bring the bill. Very friendly though? 

Only comments on the otherwise excellent food - skip the nutella crepe, in hindsight probably a bad choice and the butter lettuce salad could have used double the lettuce."}
{"text":"Ok, I must admit, this place had one of the most DELICIOUS pizzas I have ever tried! And that's coming from a genuine, authentic pizza lover.

They give you the option of splitting the pizza into two halves, so you're able to try out 2 different pizzas on one dish! I was able to try 4 different pizzas and they were all delicious!

Also, their service was excellent! Shoutout to the waiter for accommodating my needs and making me feel welcomed!"}
{"text":"Went here on a date a while back with the lady. The food was delicious and it was served quickly. They had a pretty solid craft beer selection too. I'd definitly go back."}
{"text":"I had heard and read about this place for over a year but I lived too far to ever go here, plus I am lazy when it comes to driving too. Well good news and bad news. The good news is I had a class near this place so I went there for lunch finally. The bad news? It was just okay, talk about a big let down. 

First, the good is the excellent atmosphere. The place is just beautiful and the setting is in a nice and quiet neighborhood that you never thought is Phoenix. Luckily the weather is gorgeous at this time of year and the servers were very nice. You just can't beat the atmosphere, it is a great place to take out of town guest to impress just make sure they don't expect the same from the food. 

The food, Now to be fair, I do not know where all these wood buring or what I call rustic pizza craze is coming from. From grimaldis to lagrande orange to other places like these, their crust are just awful from my point of view. I use to live in Chicago and those were real crust that you can actually see and taste and feel the textures in your mouth from the buttery thick crust to the crispy and light thin crust. All I can ever feel are just the toppings, the crust is paper thin with no texture or taste. Please the outside crust don't count, who eats that with the ingredients huh? Well all I can say is that if it is thin crust, it should be nice and crispy, not barely able to hold up the pizza that you have to eat it with a fork. 

I have to say their ingredients is top notch and the salami was excellent on the Davoda pizza. Else everything was alright, the sauce was good, but not the best I have had by far. Beside that there is nothing to judge off really in a pizza, crust, toppings and sauce really is all. It was average, but again, next time that  I have outside visitors from out of state, definitely taking them here to enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love this place.  They have great gluten free pizza and salads for those of you who cannot eat gluten.  The patio is very comfortable and ambient.   Definitely a great place for a date night"}
{"text":"Can't say I enjoyed the food here much. Maybe it was the pizza I got (the vegetarian) but my friends didn't think to highly of the Pizza's they had gotten either. I was impressed by the ambience of the restaurant and the overall presentation. But the pizza itself was not great at all. It's definitely no where near the taste of Bianco's and I was hoping this place would be a good alternative.  My friends go here a lot for lunch to get sandwiches. I may give that a try sometime but I would advise against coming here for dinner.

Instead grab dinner somewhere else and come here and grab a nutella & banana crepe for dessert! Now that was good."}
{"text":"Love coming here for lunch and dinner! Perfect for a lunch hour and good options to choose from and now offer pizza during lunch time. Absolutely love going here for dinner and the ambiance is so cozy and relaxing. Also love the fact that they have live music playing in the evenings"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Delicious!  Delicious!  Their pizza is better than Pizzeria Bianco, in my opinion and their nutella crepes are to die for!"}
{"text":"A colleague took me here on a recent business trip, and on my next trip I will definitely be back. The thing that impressed me about  Cibo's is the food is all very fresh and very high quality. I don't know if they cure their own olives, but it wouldn't surprise me - it's that kind of place. You just can't go wrong on that menu. Portions are generous but not absurd and service was great; friendly, thoughtful - eager, even. The staff seemed proud of the place.The surroundings were very nice, too.  I may share the secret of Cibo's with my other colleagues when we visit Phoenix next month...if they're extra nice to me."}
{"text":"Love their sweet white wine I order all the time with the vegetarian. Oh soooo good. Cute atmosphere, service isn't bad and the price is well worth it."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best places to eat in all of PHX. 

The food is excellent.

The crepe desserts are fantastic. 

The wait staff are as professional as anywhere else in the City.

Patio seating has music and a great atmosphere.

And I got to sit at the table next to TV10's Kari Lake.....practically needed a pitcher of ice water to unwedge myself out from under my table."}
{"text":"So fantastic for lunch. Save room for dessert. The crepes are awesome."}
{"text":"may or may not be good food, don't know, but what i do know is the staff is not very informed about the menu. went to chibo because they had \"gluten-free\" pizza and my wife and i asked the staff about cross contamination issues due to her allergy to gluten, celiacs, and the staff acted as if we asked about a major physics problem. one young lady even told us that the gluten amino disentegrates in the oven due to the high heat! i'm cool with people not understanding how celiacs works and the complications it brings but the people at chibo do not have a clue."}
{"text":"Wow, what a fun night.  We happened on Cibo this past week.  My husband, daughter and I drove up to a beautifully lit yard with music and people sitting around a fire pit all happy in conversation.  We had a wait, not too long, but the music and great wine helped it pass quickly.  The owners were in and out checking on everything:) We were seated inside the house next to a table of locals who made us feel as though we were at a comfortable dinner party.  We ate wonderful food in an atmosphere that made us feel relaxed and at home. When we left we were all smiles as the owner hugged me and said goodbye and our new friends at the table next to us did the same.  Fantastic dining experience!"}
{"text":"The best Margherita pizza in Phoenix! Cibo has always been my favorite pizza spot. Great atmosphere in the heart of downtown."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on a business trip. The place has free valet parking and several choices on where you can dine. Outside, inside, bar, patio. It has a really nice feel to it almost like you are eating at someone's house. I had a rigatoni special with fresh pasta, marinara sauce, and ricotta cheese. It was excellent. My friend had a pizza that was obviously hand made with care. The wait staff was very friendly and patient and everything was fresh and served promptly. This is a wonderfully place with great food and atmosphere. The only reason why I did not give them 5 stars is because I wished the portions were a little bigger. This may not be fair to them because I am a big eater. Great place, I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of the best meals we've ever had. The food is great, the meatballs on the happy hour menu are wonderful as is the gnocchi. We had the pasta, I highly recommend either - and the servers were very knowledgable, super friendly. Found the perfect bottle of wine to go with our meal from Sicily, and the salads were unbelievable. Limoncello was mind blowing, the chef makes it himself and shows a lot of attention to detail. This place does NOT disappoint. We felt like we had an amazing meal - really an experience - for a very reasonable price tag."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. We went late after a show downtown and even near closing the food and staff was just excellent. I love the outdoor seating and the atmosphere. It's a must go if your downtown looking for pizza."}
{"text":"Cibo?  Don't bother.  I would give a half star if I could.  Our experience started with an awkward wait at the front door as staff walked past us and two other parties. No one even acknowledged that we were standing there.  It was confusing because we weren't sure if we should seat ourselves or wait.  The restaurant was only about one third full and the lunch rush was over. Finally someone said hello after about 5 to 7 minutes (which is long enough to make one feel very awkward and uncomfortable) and we got a table. 

Then the second wait started.  It took our server about 10 minutes to come over and say hello.  You can notice a lot in 10 minutes.  For example, a dirty menu.  That is a big pet peeve of mine.  What does the kitchen look like if the menu has food stains all over it?  And to top it off, our server left us with that dirty menu until the end of our meal.  

We finally get in our drink and food order; a beer, glass of wine, glass of coke and a water, bruschetta and fior di latte pizza for lunch.  The drinks arrived another 10 minutes later, long enough for us to witness a couple walk in, wait and then leave after being ignored.  The drinks arrived, minus the water, and of course our server disappeared;  the bartender was helpful when I got my own water at the bar.

Suddenly a staffer arrived with some little plates and a small bowl of something.  At first we thought it was some type of sampler but, ha ha, it was our bruschetta appetizer. The one ingredient you would expect in bruschetta is tomatoes.  Tomatoes were certainly not a major ingredient here. There were sliced artichokes (tasted like the jar you buy at the supermarket), about 7 diced pieces of tomato and 2 big chunks of garlic on top.  The best part was the crusty bread which was break-your-teeth-hard-melba-toast, which had no centre to put the artichoke spread on...sorry, the \"bruschetta\" on.  

The pizza was ok.  Well, it really had no taste..except for all the basil they loaded on it.  It was an almost acceptable bread filler.  Not like the pizza I ate for the 9 years I lived in Italy.  Ok, maybe I can't compare Italy to Canada, but the pizza still needs to have taste.

Our server was well aware of our food experience but quickly brushed it off and was very breezy and casual about it. It appeared that she didn't really care.  I worked in the service and hospitality industry for many years and understand customer service. This experience was below standard in my opinion. 

Managers of Cibo, maybe get a handle on your staff.  Owners of Cibo, maybe pay closer attention your business.

I did like the fresco at the entrance.  Take a look as you walk by."}
{"text":"Cibo prob did not need my review but I like to suggest trying the eggplant parm sandwich. It is not heavy at all and the eggplant is not drenched in batter or grease.  Comes with a side salad, very fresh.  I have not tried this restaurant for dinner yet, but heard the pizza is amazing."}
{"text":"Had a decent panzanella at Cibo one recent afternoon. 
There was another menu on the go where I sat at the bar. Oddly it wasn't offered to me. 
I decided to have a glass of red. Forget what it was, but it was served to warm, I left most of it. 
It wasn't my first time there, and I will go back again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Amazing food and love the atmosphere! The service is spot on and everyone is very friendly. They are always busy so we try to go before the rush."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite spots in Phx just due to it's very relaxed, romantic, and unique setting. Alongside this, their pizza is delicious but it may not be for everyone. Typically I order the Diavola and add ricotta cheese, AMAZING!! And I can't fail to mention their crepes; the Nutella crepe with strawberries is to die for!!"}
{"text":"Most recently I went to Cibo on a Friday night. The hostesses seemed a bit disorganized. We had to wait about 20 mins -30 mins for a table for 3, so we had a drink at bar. The bartender was helpful and attentive.

When we got seated upstairs there were a good amount of empty tables so that was a bit strange. Our server was friendly and got our bottle of wine from the bar sent up as the hostess said she couldn't bring it up with us. The atmosphere upstairs was nice, open and its perfect for a get together with friends.

The menu has many great Italian options we ordered the arancini, garganelli pasta and mushroom pizza. The server came back within 5 mins to tell us that they ran out of pizza dough!! We were super disappointed with that. So we ordered the cod and tuna instead. 

When the arancini came out the runner plopped it on the table said \"meatballs\" and walked away lol. They tasted delicious (best in the city) and they were not meatballs. The garganelli pasta came out great, I would definitely order it again, my friends were happy with the tuna and cod as well.

For dessert we had the Dark Chocolate torta which was good. It wasn't too sweet which I liked but I would probably go for something else next time. It didn't wow me, we didn't even finish it (unusual for dessert).

The wine and conversation flowed all night.
 
If it wasn't for the mediocre service and the fact that they ran out of pizza dough on a Friday night (Big thumbs down!). I would really rate Cibo higher than a 3 star. I've had good experiences here in the past and I really like their enclosed patio in the summer and happy hour specials."}
{"text":"So I have been eye ballin this place since I found out that I was heading to Phoenix.  What brought me here was the great reviews.  When we actually made it to town, I spoke to a few locals who highly reccomended this place also.  So we finally made it to Cibo on our 3rd night for dinner.  It seemed crowded but there was plenty of room and we were seated right away.  The staff was super friendly and easy on the eyes if you know what I mean..haha...We ordered the Di Notti and the Funghi pies and washed it all down with some local craft beers (oak creek hfeweizen).  Everything about this place was amazing including the tab.  The views of the city are also great at night...Good job Cibo!  We will meet again some day soon I hope."}
{"text":"I have a thing for cozy, romatic nooks with those bistro lights and fireplaces. I am sure my husband would take me anywhere I want for our anniversary and for the last two years I have chosen Cibo. The first year we went, the owner was there and he offered us free limoncellos to celebrate. I think they do that for everyone but it felt special. You can dress up or go in jeans and it will work. It's smallish but there is room to have your own private conversation. Just be sure to try the nutella crepes!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I've only ever been here for their happy hour, but it is one of my current favourites.

The happy hour deal is $5 pizzas and $4 snacks, house wine and 12oz draft beers from Mon - Sat, 3-5pm and the last hour (9-10pm Mon-Thurs and 10-11pm Fri & Sat). If you're already a fan it's worth mentioning that the pizzas are a variation on the usual pizzas (missing an ingredient) but still amazing. My current pick is the Wild Boar Bacon. 

On Sundays the happy hour special isn't on but they have half price all their regular pizzas (!!) and the same $4 wine and beer specials. They have some good beer choices on tap too - including local faves like Last Best and Tool Shed.

I was here just a few days ago and the service was great. The server and bartender were really friendly and offered great service - even checking in with us before the kitchen closed to see if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Always SO busy too. The pizza was amazing and the few glasses of wine made everything even better :)  We sat outside in May, though a little warm, it was still enjoyable. The small, candle lit tables and overall ambiance of Cibo makes it worth going back. I can't wait to go back when it's cooler out and maybe they'll have the outside fireplace burning. They also had live music that I didn't necessarily care for, a little cheesy, but it was live and that counts :)"}
{"text":"Fun, quirky yet sophisticated, place. Their urban pizzas make up the majority of the menu and are always delicious. With every glass of wine I try here I think I fall a tad in love. Patio and ambience are great. Live musician playing low-key ambient music many nights. 

Can easily be a \"casual dress\" place but it's got a romantic aspect to it and many people dress up, too.

Really a neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the urban feel and wonderfull pizza look no further! Cibos setting couldnt be any better, in a vintage house on an historical street and touches of detail everywhere it instantly puts you in a great mood. And the FOOD! 

Try anything and you will not be dissappointed but if you want to be pushed over your culinary edge......desert crepe's!"}
{"text":"Cibo Urban Pizzeria Caf√© is a nice quaint place.  Went there for lunch and tried Margherita  pizza and Salsiccia with tomato sauce, sausage and mozzarella.  The crusts on both pizzas were good with a fair amount of char but could have been a little crispier. I would highly recommend this place if it there weren't better pizza places in Phoenix (Bianco?).  I would give the pizza 3.5 to 4 stars.  However, their pizza menu is quite extensive and I would like to revisit and try some other pizza styles.  

We did have the Nutella and Mascarpone cheese crepe and it was great. 

Note, most of the patrons there were having salads and sandwiches which looked really good!"}
{"text":"Oh god, the crepes!! And everything else is wonderful, too! The patio is fantastic this time of year and they are very dog friendly :)"}
{"text":"Meh.  It's okay if you like your pizza crust soggy.  I've been several times before and the crust has always been soggy.  On my most recent visit I asked them to bake the crust longer to make it crispy.  It was soggy again.  

Please note one point of caution regarding the other reviews of this restaurant.  This place may be quicker to get into, but it is most definitely NOT anywhere near the caliber of Pizzeria Bianco.  Would every pizza chef in town who has a James Beard Award please raise their hand?

On March 18th I received this message from Karen Martingilio:
 
Dear Ted, thanks for giving us a couple of tries, everyone has their opinion about what they like in a pizza, in Italy they use a knife and fork, we make our crust more soft and chewy more Italian style, and that does not appeal to everyone, however to imply that our other reviewers are just coming to us because the wait is shorter, or that we take less pride in our product then others is somewhat mean spirited, I m sure you didn t intend to insult our dedicated chef or our restaurant but unfortunately it could be misinterpeted by other Yelpers, you are intitled to your opinion and so are our fans on Yelp, thanks again for your imput, Karen Martingilio

Yelpers, as Karen notes above, I am entitled to my opinion.  Her email does not change my opinion in any way."}
{"text":"I was at Cibo the other night and to be quite honest it was different from when I went  a few months ago .
The food was wanna be Italain but tastes more I don't know.not italian....italian is easy ingredients and not a lot of them.
The place was empty something must be going on.
What is this number thing on the menu.....oh by the way what style of Pizza was it???I can get this type of dought at italian supermarket  ...oh and the dessert where to say to least pathetic..."}
{"text":"Just left the place.  Had the meatballs as appetizer..they were good.   We had the tartufata added sausage and half was cheese..was OK.  Cheese pizza was not good..  Daughter had Mac and cheese but had more butter and hardly any cheese.  Had to ask for extra cheese on the side.For dessert we had the crepe with strawberries and nutella..that was VERY good.  Probably won't be be coming back."}
{"text":"I'll give you the good news first. The atmosphere was nice, and it was really beautifully decorated. 

The food we did receive was delicious! To start we had the arancini, and polenta fries. LOVED the arancini, it was out of this world good! As for the polenta fries, they weren't really my thing. I ordered the ricotta gnocchi, it was a good serving size, and tasted great.

The bad news. My fianc√© he picked not one, but two different items on the menu, only to find out they were out of it. It was 6:00 on a Monday night, and you don't have two of your seafood dishes that are on your regular menu? I would have been a little more understanding had it been a weekend or on a feature menu. He ended up ordering the wild boar pizza, which was great, but pretty disappointing when you had your heart set on seafood. Our service was just mediocre, I don't know if the girl was new, or maybe nervous, but I could barely hear her half the time.

Overall, it was an ok experience. Would I go back? Possibly at some point."}
{"text":"Thanks to a recommendation and other Yelp reviews, I found myself here on a Saturday night for dinner. Used the mobile check-in and only waited about 40 minutes. Live music in the patio and beautiful lighting/atmosphere helped pass the time.

Sat at a table near the bar, greeted by the waiter and promptly served waters and given menus. Started with the 3 bruschetta appetizer. Delicious! Prosciutto and fresh mozzarella, fresh tomatoes and basil, and a savory bean topping. For pizzas we ordered the Rustica and another with prosciutto and Italian sausage. Crispy crust and fresh ingredients, what more could you ask for? The arugula on the Rustica was a nice green and great aroma.  Cheese was perfectly melted as well. For dessert, enjoyed a simple Nutella crepe (light and fluffy) with a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream.  

The lighting and decor of the refurbished homestyle restaurant is comfortable and inviting. Definitely recommend for an evening out and delicious food."}
{"text":"Wonderful Italian/Pizza place with nice and effective service. Make sure to make reservation for big party. The Il Tagliere (cold meat apetizer), 3 pairs of Bruschetta, Bolognese pasta are wonderful. All pizza's are good but My favorite is Tartufala."}
{"text":"With a patio sheltered from the noise of 17th Avenue (and growing the herbs used in most of the dinner items) a very large dining space and a menu full of excellent scodellina options, Cibo is a great place for chatty drinks with the girls, chatty pasta with your family or pizza sharing with your date.

Far from classic, Cibo takes Italian and turns it Calgarian with modern menu items, super-fresh, super local ingredients in dishes you can't help but share and hipster-turned-friendly servers willing to laugh with the guests.

Cibo is bustling with the hippest of pizza connoisseurs laughing over fig and gorgonzola pie, the trendiest of the Uptown 17th sharing smoked black cod anitpesto and the coolest of Calgary shouting \"you gotta try this!\" passing house-made olives to the next table; all this activity set firmly on the backbone of simply great food.

Cibo is fun, it's fun to hang out at for a drink, it's fun to talk to people there and it's a fun place to eat.

T."}
{"text":"Yep, I really like this place! It's quite a quaint and small house, but they also have a pretty great patio in the front of the house with misters to keep you cool/alive in the PHX heat.  I have never experienced an anchovy pizza, and i finally had a chance to try a piece at Cibo.  Surprisingly, it was quite good! If you like salty things, you'll love the anchovy pizza.  One downside for me is that they have so few pizzas that offer meat as a topping.  I think there's only one on the menu! Other than that, though, the quality of the food is excellent and they have some very good wines to choose from. I recommend the Candoni Pinot Noir:) /Art"}
{"text":"I was already excited to check out Cibo when my sister started telling me how awesome it was. 

The inside is ambient and energetic. We sat in the upstairs which was quite spacious. Although it was quite a busy night I wasn't overwhelmed by the noise- the person across from me could hear what I was saying without having to yell. Always important in these bustling hot spots!

The menu is made to share and comes out in courses. The sharing aspect makes it pretty cute for a date, but it makes sense if you are sitting down with family as well.

The appetizers were my favourite part of the menu. I tried the lamb meatballs and the arancini. Both were out of this world good, and I'll be back for more! Neither disappointed. Despite their limited selection they also have some great beers on tap here.

My only complaint is that out second course came out too fast, almost right after the appetizers. I would have felt rushed if our server wasn't pacing everything else so well.

If you are a dessert person, try the canololi!"}
{"text":"RIDICULOUSLY GOOD!!!  This is the best pizza I have ever had... In fact, it's so other-worldly good that I almost hesitate to call it pizza!  More like slices of heaven... Especially the Tartufata pizza!  Omg... Salivating thinking about it..."}
{"text":"Always a great place to eat! Love the acoustic music outside! Awesome place for lunch or dinner and the desserts are always amazing!"}
{"text":"The food (apps through dessert) was delicious and the character and ambiance of the restaurant is so special, especially for Phoenix. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Bend over backward service! Margherita pizza to die for. Great wine selection. Good ambiance. YUM!"}
{"text":"Great date spot!  The patio is so cute.  The pizzas we had were fantastic and the Nutella Mascarpone crepe was to die for!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Pizza with a thin but amazingly flavorful crust, delicious cheese and spicy salami, and not AFRAID to add just the right amount of mouth-watering sauce! Highly recommend for great vintage atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"Great food. The best part of this place is the pizza happy hour! $5 pizza between 3-5. Boar bacon pizza is amazing!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza place I've been to outside of Italy. The best part, they actually have LEGIT and delicious gluten free pizza!!! First time I've eaten gluten free pizza and not gagged! AMAZING! I highly recommend the burrata as well! Great start to the meal. Our server was fantastic and suggested the perfect wine and craft beers. Charming, historic restaurant. My husband will be making this part of our regular date night scene!!"}
{"text":"As I'm preparing to write this review, I'm experiencing flash backs of how delicious the food was, and I'm salivating as we speak....

I recently visited Cibo while visiting my parents in Arizona. It was a recommendation by a colleague, and I had to share the experience with my lovely parents. Although there was a wait for sitting inside, we didn't mind, because we enjoyed a nice chilled glass of their House Chardonay. Although they said it would be a 20 minute wait, we were seated after 10 minutes. I loved the atmosphere, vibe and feel of Cibo. It's so cozy, and welcoming. 

On to the juicy stuff....the FOOD! We started with the Caprese Salad and Pesto Salad. They were both so amazingly delectable. The Caprese salad served it's purpose more than I imagined. The ginormous slices of fresh mozzarella were drizzled with a light olive oil, and accompanied by tomato slices and basil. It was served with some thinly sliced toast that the perfect compliment. On to the Pesto Salad! The Pesto dressing was phenomenal, and to be honst, I don't think I've had a pesto quite like this. It wasn't too thick, but complimented the bed of mixed greens, grape tomatoes, shaved parmigiano, pine nuts and roasted potatoes, perfectly!  For our entree's we ordered the Fughi Pizza, but added Spicy salame and Balsamic onions. I just went into dreamland thinking about how the pizza tasted when I took my first bite! Again, they had mounds of fresh mozzarella, mushrooms and a great tomato sauce. The addition of the balsamic onions and spicy salame took this pizza to a whole new level.  I love how thin the crust of the pizza was, which allowed you to enjoy the true beauty of their pizzas; the fresh cheese and sauce. 

I'm going to start a new paragraph just to describe how AMAZING the dessert was that we ordered. Since it was a belated Birthday dinner for my mother, we ordered a Crepe for dessert. It was filled with Mascarpone cheese, and my most favorite thing on earth, NUTELLA!! After all, life is much better with a spoonful of Nutella! It was dusted with powdered sugar, as well as melted chocolate sauce. We decided to forget all of our inhibitions, and added a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream. The warm crepe, accompanied by the ice cream, was delectably sinful! 

Before I give myself a heart attack describing the food any longer, I'm going to stop myself. Cibo is definitely a win/win situation. Two thumbs up all around! I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I used to love Cibo for their food and atmosphere, but I went the other night and couldn't believe this was the same place. The margherita and arugula/walnut pizza were both droopy/soggy, the de cecco pizza was a bit better, the arancini was the only good item we ordered, the burrata was nothing like I remember. It had zero flavor and the bread that it came with was stale. I never use extra salt on my food but found myself putting salt on the burrata. It was very bland and the center was not creamy like it should be. I still like the atmosphere but that doesn't make up for the lackluster food."}
{"text":"I visited this dainty little restaurant on what looks to be a not-so-nice area of Phoenix built into a house with an adorable front seating area while visiting family in AZ.  My friends were raving about this place while we sat at Gino's East in Chicago dining on what I like to think as some of the finest pizza around.  So for someone to suggest there was good pizza, in Arizona, I had to see it to believe it.  

The inside is literally the front of a house with a bar area immediately to your right, a table for a large group set front and center, with the kitchen behind it, and bathrooms that in any other setting someone would have viewed the cracked toilet seat and floor tiles as grotesque, but here, the added bouquet of flowers and wall mirror made for a rustic, inside-someone's-personal-house, geriatric feel.  

We sat outside, as the temperature had cooled down to a manageable, sunless 90 degrees and my friend's fiance was meeting up with us with her puppy (yes it's dog friendly). The outside patio was separated into two areas with the main walkway down the middle.  The floor was made up of mismatched bricks, some jutting up, with small two to four seat, wrought iron tables strategically placed around the center where a tree was unruly growing out of the brick and mud.  They had decorated it with a string of white lights which gave the atmosphere of the perfect place for a date. 

Everything at Cibo is cooked in their fire-grill oven, and they mostly have wine with a few specialty beers brought to you by a rather odd waiter.  We first ordered an appetizer of Schiacciata Maremma, half without eggplant and our little sandwiches came with just enough time to gobble them up before my friend's fiance arrived and even knew we ordered.  The crunch of the bread from the wood-fired oven with the melted cheese holding the vegetables in was the perfect start to a fantastic meal.  We then ordered pizzas, the Pizza Rosse Vegetariana and I believe my friend had the Di Notte pizza, adding potatoes.  The crust was thin and had just the right amount of crisp, but still strong enough to hold the massive amount of toppings.  I wouldn't compare it to Gino's East, but overall, it was a pretty good, healthy pizza.  It felt almost homemade.  

We finished the meal off with a nutella and strawberry crepe which was to DIE for.  There are few restaurant chef's that seem to make a crepe the correct way, thin, less like a pancake, and still strong enough to hold together your ingredients. They managed to get the crepe and ingredients just right and we walked away extremely full and satisfied.  Not before her 3 month old puppy went to sit on the neighboring tables lap after they picked her up.  An extremely chill, relaxing atmosphere.  I highly recommend finding this Phoenix gem while you are in town."}
{"text":"I love Cibo! Everything about this place is great.  
Perfect for:
-Dinner with mom.  My mom came to visit and this was our Friday night dinner spot.  We walked from my apartment, had a glass of wine while waiting for a table to open on the adorable patio, and then indulged in salad, pizza, and even desert.

-Holiday staff party.  I was in charge of booking reservations for our holiday staff party.  I wanted a place with great food that wouldn't be too over the top for a bunch of teachers.  Not only was the food great, but the service was amazing.  They put us in the back \"Carriage House\", with our own waiter/bartender.  The ambiance was perfect and it was in a central location for those of us who wanted to continue the night at a nearby bar.

-Date. My boyfriend and I can walk here for take out, but we have also had a very romantic date here and I can't wait to go back.  The tree and flower covered patio just does it for me.
This is my definition of an urban pizzeria!"}
{"text":"Best gluten free pizza I have ever had!

My boyfriend and I came here on a date and we can't wait to go back. The food was amazing, the staff was friendly and very attentive and the prices were so reasonable."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place, such great reviews.  As soon as we got there the excitement turned to disappointment.  My husband and I decided on a last minute date night when I get off work.  I had been looking at this on yelp and it was on my list.  We went last night, Sunday, and got there about 8 pm (they closed at 9 pm).

First we walked in, was not sure where to go since it was out first time.  Someone walked by and said the hostess will be back in a few minutes.  So we waited..and waited.  About 15 minutes later a hostess arrived.  We asked to be seated outside since it was beautiful out.  She was annoyed that the table she sat us at was directly against a bench which I kept hitting my elbow on.  We asked to move (there were a lot of tables) which annoyed her even more.  About 15 minutes later our server showed up (granted now the close in 30 minutes).  We asked for a cup of ice and lemons for our water multiple times...never saw those the whole meal.  She came to the table for our order and stated they only had 4 pizza's left so if we wanted pizza we needed to order immediately.  Since we had never been there, looking at the menu for 3-4 minutes was not enough time, but we wanted pizza.  We got a pepperoni like pizza and a sausage and potato white pizza.  We also ordered calamari as a appetizer.  

When the food came out, all of it came at once.  This is my biggest pet peeve of restaurants!!  Appetizers come before a meal...not with it!  The calamari was nothing to talk about...frozen and bland.  The best thing about it was that we got the lemons with is, so we used those in our water.  The pizzas came out at the same time...again nothing great.  The crust was actually delicious, but there was hardly any cheese on them at all.  We asked for parm cheese, never got that either.  On the potato pizza the potatoes were still hard (under cooked) so we peeled them all off.  The pepperoni was okay, just needed more cheese.  The crust was the best part of the pizza.  

The food was okay...the service was horrible (never got what we asked for, drinks empty whole meal, and rushed to get everything since it was close to closing).  I think with this experience we will not come back here.  We drove over 30 minutes to try this place and it was a disappointment.  I know there are a lot of good reviews, but this is my view, which is not great."}
{"text":"Cibo!   Eating outside is a major part of the experience even on a hot summer night in Phoenix!  Worth the dampness from head to toe.  The BONUS is sitting under the African tree with the lights and grapes with the FULL moon shining on us  ~

Our red haired waiter sporting 1950's style glasses was fun, fun, fun and pleasingly attentive.   We had white wine;  superb choice thanks to the 4 different wine tastes I received while choosing it.  

The strawberry/walnut salad was a bit dry, yet the feta was marvelous!  Great soft texture to melt in your mouth.  

The pizza was the sausage and it was wood fired, nice and perfect.  Just enough food for the 3 of us ~

So much food, just the right amount for our bellies.  For the 3 of us, the bill was only $43.00.  Not too bad on a Saturday night to go in 1/3's.

~ Luana Joya Lucia"}
{"text":"I stopped there on my way back to San Diego. I have that their Pizzas are very delicious. Me and my friend ordered four half of different pizzas and they all tasted good. The restaurant setting is very nice too. They had live musician playing on the night we went. Service was good. I will diffidently give it another visit next time i am in AZ."}
{"text":"I finally got to try out this place yesterday at my gfs baby shower. I was soooo excited that I finally made it here seeing that I have had a few friends continuously recommending this place. This could be a great date day/night place or a place you meet up with a group of friends. They offer both in and outdoor seating. I highly recommend outdoor seating:) Beautiful weather during the day and beautiful weather at night plus romantically lit up with small lights around the patio. We were seated on the patio right away around 1pm on Saturday afternoon. We had a party of 10 and had more than enough space.  There was a young boy singing and playing music on the patio, which made the overall ambiance and atmosphere even better especially on any day in Arizona:) The waitress filled our glasses with water and lemon right away. I thought it was a bit strange that the water came with a lemon already in the water because typically they don't and I also happen to be someone who does not like knowing that someone probably used there bare hands to put it there. We waited about 10 minutes until the rest of our party arrived and began ordering our food. 

About 10min after we order, the majority of us ran out of water and additional drinks people had ordered. So we waited, waited, and waited some more until finally we were able to waive down a different waiter to refill our drinks. Our food began to arrive about 30min after it was ordered. I ordered the Rustica Pizza, which was highly recommended to me by multiple friends and boy was I pleased! The crust was by far the best part! It was semi thin with a crisp bottom crust. The prosciutto was very tender and melts in your mouth and the cheese was just he right amount. This pizza was AWESOME! I also tried some of the entrees around the table including the side salad, which was huge with a variety of organic veggies, fresh parm cheese and balsamic vinaigrette to top, the Caprese sandwich, and the Margherita Pizza, which were all great! 

Half way through our meal we again waited without drinks for about 15min. We were at Cibo for a total of 2.5hrs and our waitress came by our table 4 times. With that being said we waited around for refills, waited about 30min for our table to be cleared of the finished plates and had to physically get up to get our waitress twice because we couldn't waive someone over to us. My gf had to wait a long time to open her gifts because it took the staff a ton of time to clear a table that should only take 2min to  clean. While we were waiting I decided to use their restroom. On my way there I noticed that the location of the restroom was hard to find and was shoved into a back corner where they also had shoved 8 sets of chairs. It order to get to the restroom I had to walk sideways about 10ft (and I'm tiny!) to the restroom to handle my business. The average size woman would not have been able to fit through such a small space, which to me raises a HUGE red flag. I went to wash my hands and to my surprise the paper towel dispenser was not working so I had to use me pants...lovely! When I got back to the table we finished unwrapping gifts and called it a day. Overall, I loved the food and ambiance and feel that the service we recieved was extremely poor considering that it was not busy at all and there was no excuse for it. I would not recommend this place to groups larger than 6 people and I would also advise anyone who goes here to be ready to test their patience when it comes to service:)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food and the restaurant has a nice menu. It is a smaller place but the better italian restaurants seem to have this setting. The service was great and the atmosphere was very welcoming. I will be back to this restaurant.

The chef seems to know what he is doing with the menu. I had the veal and clams and both were very good."}
{"text":"Dint come here with 4 plus people. We called in advanced and we have waited almost an hour for a table. The whole aesthetic might cute and all but if it takes this long just for a table..forget about it."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I quite liked it and would like to go back when/if I'm in the area again. We were seated by the open kitchen, so it was entertaining to watch the pizzas being made. I had a pasta and it was good, though a little bit lukewarm. I would love to go back to try the pizza, though."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and pasta and frankly, everything! We've been coming here since we were still in college and even had our graduation dinner here because we love it so much. Wood fired pizza, homemade pasta, homemade limoncello, crepes, etc. just a great family owned business that takes care of their customers. One of my favorites here in AZ. If you haven't been just do yourself the favor and go, you won't regret it. Oh and I'm vegetarian and they have plenty of options for our kind too :)"}
{"text":"I like the food here but their severs are very poor and they close on sun day or they closed on mon day and this is one off the reason we are not going black here"}
{"text":"What to say that hasn't been said? My husband and I visited Cibo by chance. We had driven by about a year before while we were kind of lost downtown, and said \"that place is really busy, we'll have to try it some time.\" I am SO happy that we did tonight. We were seated promptly outside tucked in the corner. It's December, so you would think we would be chilly, we kept our jackets on during dinner but there are plenty of heaters surrounding the outside tables, so we were kept warm. The ambiance is beautiful, the outside tables are lit how you wish every restaurant you visit would be.   

I had the green tea, real tea, nothing that they bring you in a bag, but they actually pour the hot water over the real tea leaves, it was very good. My husband said the coffee was rather good as well. 

As an appetizer we split the pear salad: Spinach, vinaigrette, almonds, cheese, pears and honey. I'm not horribly adventurous when it comes to mealtime so I was nervous, but it was so good. 

I'd say 1 pizza can heartily feed 2 people, but we opted for separate ones to try anyway. I had the Salsiccia (sausage, mozzarella, and red sauce), while my husband opted for the Salsiccia con Patate (sausage, roasted potatoes). The crust is soft and chewy, not overdone like so many places. His was a bit drier than mine, no sauce, but both were still good and we walked away with a whole pizza left over between the two of us, yummy yummy left overs! 

The Dessert: All we could say was \"Oh My!\" We had the Fresca Crepe. A delicious crepe filled with vanilla ice cream and fruit, topped with whipped cream and more fruit. Fresh peaches, kiwi, and strawberries. We had the Nutella on the side but it was quite good drizzled on top. I'd go back for the dessert alone!

Our server, James, was very polite and there was one girl going around always asking people if they needed more water. I never felt neglected by the waitstaff and it is Friday night after all. 

Overall, I have to say this is a favorite thus far!"}
{"text":"What a quaint place with good food. 

Friday night is hard to get a dinner table anywhere and Cibo is not the exception.

They don't take reservations so be ready to wait.  

The place is cozy with a great vibe and great service. While I was waiting I was grated by every server who walked by me. They looked sincerely friendly and polite. One of the waitress with short hair and a long skirt had a gorgeous smile and was super kind, unfortunately my table was in a different table. Next time I'll try to get a table in her section :-)

The food was pretty good. I had the Omero salad. Goat cheese and strawberries among other great ingredients/ It was really good. Nice serving size too.

I also has the funghi pizza. Very tasty and a perfect serving.

Not sure about the prices since I didn't pay.

This place worth the visit for sure.

Cheers"}
{"text":"AMAZING food, I used to work within walking distance. The eggplant parmigiana sandwich was my favorite, and the pizza was always great too. On cool days the patio is perfect. Food has always come quickly, and the servers are always attentive. I now work way in the East Valley, and I must say this is one thing I miss having."}
{"text":"I'm a jew from NY and i know my pizza. Bianco, spinato's, grimaldis and pizzeria federal are all better. The hot sandwiches they serve for lunch during the day are the whip so is the nutelle crepe. Service & atmosphere are good. You can't go wrong for lunch or date night."}
{"text":"Delicious food, wonderful atmosphere, owners were very nice and helpful, service was great.  Enjoyed it with another couple, but could be a great romantic date place too. Will definitely make this a regular on our list of favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Delicious and very reasonably priced lunch special that lets you sample a salad, a spread with bread, a pasta or pizza, and an amazing little dark chocolate short bread to finish it off. Very friendly and prompt service. Perfect lunch spot!"}
{"text":"We have been to Cibo many times, we have also rented out the Carriage House for our company Christmas party and have never had any issues, ever. Until today. 

Grab yourself a nice glass of wine, pair it with an assortment of exceptional cheeses, and have a seat for this glorious experience. 

We walked into Cibo, were immediately greeted by the hostess; she was very welcoming, a smile on her face, sat us within a few minutes of our arrival. Then, boys and girls came our waiter, Ross. He had a smile on his face, seemed welcoming, however, the freshly smoked cigarette odor lingering off of him was extremely unpleasant. Restaurant dining is meant to excite your senses; sight, smell, taste, touch. I mean, there is nothing like, here is your glass of iced tea, with my cigarette fingers all over it.

We were a table of 4, we all ordered our individual dinners, three ordered salads, as an appetizer, in addition to their dinner. Out came their salad AND my dinner. Wait, why is my dinner coming out with their salad you ask? Not quite sure kids. Our waiter was nowhere to be seen. I asked a different staff member to take back my meal, as the rest of the parties dinner had not arrived at the table, and that they were just served their salad. The look of bewildered confusion came upon her face. She took back my dinner, and out came our waiter, Ross telling me that \"it would be five minutes tops\" before the rest of my parties dinner came out if I can just leave my hot sandwich in front of me until their food came out. Well, fifteen minutes went by, their dinner never appeared. We asked Ross to take back my dinner, as it was now cold, also because the rest of the parties dinner has yet to come out. During this wait, the parties dinner came out, with mine in the abyss of the kitchen. Almost fifteen minutes went by, my dinner never made it out of the kitchen. I asked Ross for the manager. She came to the table, with a smirk on her face. I told her what is going on. Wait for this.... she did not even apologize, or offer to make it right. She stood there with her smirky face, saying something about the way the kitchen works. Not my problem. During all of this banter, my dinner finally made its way to the table. The manager never offered to make the situation right. 

Listen, I was not looking to have been offered anything for free, or have my meal comped. I just wanted my dinner at the same time the rest of my party was eating their dinner. I did not want to sit and eat my dinner, while they are eating their appetizer. A simple sincere apology would have made it better. 

Needless to say, we will never again step one foot into this establishment. As a paying customer, there are plenty of options for dining in this city. I get better customer service at my local grocery store then I did in this restaurant. We have rented the Carriage House for a company Christmas party, I promise you this, they have lost all future business. We work hard for our money, and it will never again be spent at Cibo. 

To the manager; not sure what your name is, you need to educate yourself on proper customer service etiquette. The way you treated me was horrendous and extremely unprofessional. You never made it right. You never even returned back to our table after our dinner was finally served, just to ask how everything was. Shame on you. What kind of example are you setting for your staff? To lack empathy to the customer. Shame on you."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Unfortunately wasn't able to try any pizzas this time around, but had a bomb crepe with fresh fruit and it's been memorable since. The crepe was perfectly fluff- not dry nor soggy. The amount of naturally sweetened fruit was a great pairing with a side of vanilla bean ice cream. We came as a group for a surprise birthday party and the ambiance during the evening was just stunning. There was a live performer, lights were on, the temperature out was just right with some heated lamps. The waitress was very helpful in recommending dishes and making sure everyone was accounted for. Dishes came out all at the same time and the waitress even brought out and helped slice our cake. Amazing service and food!"}
{"text":"Saturday night (in March) - We hosted a private party in the carriage house around back for 60-65 people.

Michael and the crew at Cibo are so accommodating and friendly.  We had wonderful service, food, and wine.  This is the perfect place for a private party.   :)"}
{"text":"Went last night and had the following:
Apps:
Mixed Vegetables - really good, loved the pickled carrots!
Schiacciata Maremma - DELICIOUS!  Basically a toasty focaccia bread with mozz and veggies in the middle.  Prob my favorite part of the meal.
Pizza:
Vegetariana (red pizza) - good, but really felt like they skimped on the veggies.  Next time i'll ask for extra or just order the Margherita.
Genova - white pizza w/ mozz, pesto, potatoes, onions, and parmesan.  This was a different pizza than I've ever had before but it was very tasty and flavorful.
Dessert (this is where Cibo really won me over):
Nutella and Banana crepe - kind of hard to mess this up, but they executed perfectly: no skimping on the nutella or bananas and the crepe was the ideal texture, thin and moist but without falling apart
Fresca crepe - packed with fresh fruit, ice cream, and whipped cream: yummy!!

Also, the beers were yummy, our server was friendly, and we got there at 5:30 so our large party got seated immediately.  Probs have to visit a couple more times and try the Margherita before I jump to 5 stars, but this place is pretty awesome."}
{"text":"This was actually my second time eating at the big 'C'(mind out of the gutter), i had been here a good 2-3 years ago for dinner. One of the first things about Cibo that draws you in is the expansive patio with benches, fire pit, and tables for service. I imagine that the fire pit and benches come in handy on a busy Friday night while you swill some wine waiting for your table. My man-date and i had stopped by the vintage craftsman home that is Cibo for a Friday lunch anticipating pizza-y goodness... nope, sandwiches and salads only for lunch.  Alright, we are big boys, no crying, suck it up, roll with the punches.  Sadly to say after perusing the sandwiches and salads i wasn't overly excited about anything, it was all a pretty much boring standards.  That isn't to say it didn't sound edible but i honestly expected a little more than the standard Prosciutto and Motz sandwiches of any Italian deli. I settle the PLT but with added Motz (BLT but Prosciutto instead of bacon) and my buddy got the Pastrami. If nothing else Cibo has amazing bread, everything else was a little boring.  The bell pepper aioli vaguely smelled like anchovies which freaked me out but i decided to eat it anyways, i am still feeling okay hours later as i write this, don't worry. The salad that came with was tasty but i could have done with less pine nuts/garnish and more attention to the sandwiches.  Nothing was terrible but i don't think i would ever rush back to eat lunch, i think i am going to try and do dinner later this week before i head back to CA but it might get passed over for Spinatos or Bianco.

{"text":"I'm really torn with Cibo's. The first time I went there was after a First Friday. Perhaps the crowd had thinned out some, but we were seated inside in the right-hand side room. The ambiance was great. Our server was friendly, informative, and attentive. My friends and I got a great bottle of wine and some appetizers. The pizza I got was the special of the night: pesto with grape tomatoes, baked and then topped with slowly melting boccincini mozzarella balls and pine nuts. It was excellent. A huge fave. I left a big fan and raved about it to other friends of mine. 

A return trip was in order. But this time all went wrong. Really wrong. Our waitress was a complete space cadet who didn't once tell us what the specials were and would disppear at odd times, raising our tweak alert. We were seated at the same table as last time, but this time the side room was full and so damn loud that we were straining to hear ourselves talk. Everyone at the other tables decided to compensate for the noise by raising their voices and thus making things even worse. So, to say the least, we were stuck in an endless cyclone of noise, getting stronger and stronger by the minute - fueled by all the hot, loud earsplitting air being exhaled by 20 people. We were miserable. We ordered a margherita, a quattro fromaggi, a proscuitto, and a sausage pizza. Three of the four came back with the crusts completely charred. I don't mind a little burn here and there - I like the crust a little crunchy, but this was ridiculous. Not helped that the waitress was serving our pizzas by reaching over the table and putting her arms smack in front of our faces. Talk about disappointment, and a shot-down credibility on my part because I took three friends who expected great things.

So I've got two trips to Cibo's which ended up on the opposite ends of the spectrum, even though I sat at the exact same table. Thus the three stars is an average of the two. Don't know if it's worth another go around. Maybe on a slow weeknight when tweaker chick is off tweaking elsewhere. 

Too bad. The co-owner knew it, too, when she hesitatingly asked us how that second night went. I wish I could have said \"Great\" but I had to be honest. I could see the disappointment on her face, but hey, still not as disappointed as me."}
{"text":"We used to live a block away from Cibo. It was our go-to pizza place and for good reason; it's delicious! Their Margherita pizza is divine, and only $10! Writing this review makes me want to go back, like, NOW for the Funghi or the Vegetariana. Think about it, you're dropping the same amount of money on a quality, fresh pizza as you would at some crap joint. 

This place can get real busy, so we usually do take out. I remember it being warm inside during the Summer months, but there's no way to escape that when you go to a small restaurant that has its doors open."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  Pizzeria Bianco is my #1 choice, but I'd have to say this comes in as a close second.  It's in a super cute little house and the wait is nowhere near what you have to endure at Pizzeria Bianco.  The food is awesome, the ambiance is great.  The owners were there when we went, and they were very personable, checking on all of the tables.  The customer service is terrific.  

If you go, save room for dessert. They have a nutella banana crepe that is to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be better but unfortunately- it's going down hill. The food is bland. The chicken in their salads especially. I used to like it, but now I have no reason to go back."}
{"text":"I have loved this place for a long time. It is an old converted house with tons of charm. The pizza is killer, so authentic and amazing. The patio is great for events when the weather is cool. In my opinion, this is on the top 3 list of the best pizzas in Arizona and I personally like it better than Pizzaria Bianco."}
{"text":"The food is just as good as the atmosphere I loved the pizza salad & crepes was just sad we missed out on the pasta (only served certain nights) but I'll be back to try it!"}
{"text":"I went to eat here with some friends and I have to say its the best pizza i have ever eaten. I was told it was going to be good, but its better then that. Its amazing!!! i would eat here everyday if it wouldn't make me 500 lbs"}
{"text":"I want to give this place a 5 but every time I've been here the service has not been great. The food is awesome though. I highly recommend the eggplant sandwich. The pastrami sandwich is pretty good too.

Valet, metered, and free street parking available.

Great lunch place."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Great atmosphere. Very good service. Awesome dessert too! Highly recommend the chocolate Nutella crapes!"}
{"text":"Man... what happened?

My wife and I felt pretty bad, after hyping Cibo up to friends for the past couple weeks, only to be treated fairly strangely and shabbily by our waiter. We were the only two in our group who had been there before, and luckily the only ones embarrassed when things did not go as smoothly as we would've hoped.

Our large party would agree that the food and the atmosphere are still top notch, as are the wines and that delicious homemade limoncello... But the service just fell off, due to one person in particular. Read Nader A's review for the full story, but the gist of it is there was a (rude) miscommunication on the waiter's part, and he was so steadfast (attitude) about not admitting his mistake that it cost him any additional tip he might have received. He also chose to do this at peak volume coinciding with the entertainer's break, so not only did everyone at our table get an earful, but so did the surrounding patrons. it was like a scene in a movie when a bunch of people who do not belong walk into the wrong bar and the needle scratches right off the record. To Nader A's credit, he remained cool, but the damage was done. Later on we found out that our waiter also dissuaded others at the table from customizing their pizzas because \"they are perfect the way they are.\" I don't know if he had something else going on and decided to take it out on us, but to snap at us the way he did was truly unacceptable.

We were planning on having the table sample some of Cibo's delicious crepes for dessert, and I'm positive we would have certainly drank a bit more as well, but instead we chose to leave early and take our business elsewhere. Will we be back? Eventually, but in all honesty not anytime soon, and definitely not in that guy's section.

I in no way would dissuade anyone from trying out Cibo. They excel at what they do, and my experience was most likely out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Great little pizza joint. We sat outdoors at night and it was a nice experience. Pizza was very good along with small appetizer platter which actually was quite large. The server was friendly and very knowledgeable. He suggested good recommendations and was not too intrusive throughout the meal. The lace looked like it is a restaurant converted from an old house and was in the middle of a residential neighborhood. But I think that added to the charm."}
{"text":"The takeaway: excellent intimate ambience / stellar service / solid pies and calzones

Headed over for a quick bite before the Suns game and the service here was incredible. We were sitting in a corner of the beautiful outdoor patio (decked with lights --great date night vibe) and almost immediately we were attended to. That did not let up all night even though a huge table of people was next to us. The lady attending us could have been the owner but we were all impressed. We were in and out in 30-40 min

The food was devine. We got the veggie pizza and this salami/prosciutto calzone. Both dishes came out hot and were solid. That salami was so addictive. Definitely could see myself coming back for more :]"}
{"text":"Haven't been in awhile due to a move to the East Valley but, my, oh my, I do love that place. Now it's back in my mind I'll have to think of a reason to get over to that side of town!"}
{"text":"I've been to Cibo a handful of times and each time I have left full, content and served well. It can be crowded if you are eating at peak times /days, but that just reiterates the tasty food and pleasant service! 

If you have not been, I hope you enjoy Cibo as much as my wife and I do."}
{"text":"Cibo is hands down, my favorite gourmet sandwich place in town. You can't go wrong here...their caprese, spek and pulled pork sandwiches are among my faves (served with a nice, lightly dressed house salad or fresh fruit, yogurt and crunchy granola - skip the chips because they're just store bought in a bag), and if you are lucky enough to go on a day when they have their meatball sandwich special, don't even hesitate - it's so delicious.

Also, consider having a private party at their adorable carriage house, it's separate from the main restaurant and used for parties of 10+. I went to lunch with 10 or so coworkers and we reserved it; the service was awesome and we had the place all to ourselves! 

My only small gripe with Cibo is their refusal to split checks; I just think it's really annoying when restaurants refuse to recognize the reality of modern dining that more often than not, people in a group are not going to all be paying as one. They're nice enough when you ask them to split it evenly between credit cards, though, so as I said, it's only a minor complaint."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a 30 year anniversary dinner with family and it was mediocre to say the least. The service was awful and the waitress Amanda was not friendly at all. Mind you there were 12 of us but it wasn't busy at all. There were several empty tables. We asked for split checks and with an attitude she said she would split them. We all ordered pizza at the same time. 

We ordered the margherita pizza and it was okay. I mean they really put a whole basil leaf on the pizza instead of shredding it or making it into smaller pieces on other slices. The crust is really thin and the cheese kept sliding off. They also don't have pepperoni which is odd for a pizza place.  Two people in our group still didn't receive their pizza as the majority of us were already done eating. They also got the same pizza and it came out 15 min later! The waitress never came out to check on us during our meal and took foreverrrr to bring our checks and bring our cards back after we paid. Also, our waters were empty during our meal and the lady who brought the last pizza out filled it since our server was no where to be found. Needless to say with the poor service and just okay pizza we will not be returning. I'd rather go to Fired Pie for the same type of pizza for cheaper."}
{"text":"Been here once before and enjoyed it so took friends Frid. night (Jan. 20th).  One of the friends has Celiac's Disease and therefore must eat a gluton-free diet, which I inquired about the previous night I was there.  I called ahead to confirm their gluton-free menu and a very snotty girl informed me they \"could make anything on their menu gluton-free\" and they \"did not take reservations.\"  We arrived at 7PM and were told of a 30 min. wait; 1 hr. later we were seated.  Another 10 mins. and a waitress asked about drinks and we ordered a bottle of wine and menus.  Another 15 mins. later our wine was brought and immediately opened, and when we asked about the gluton-free menu again, the waitress told us \"Oh, unfortunately we're all out of our gluton-free dough.  In fact two people before you just asked and couldn't get any.\"  She stared at us expecting to order something else, to which my friend said \"it's not like it's a diet I'm on, it's a lifestyle.  I can't eat anything then.\"  So after all that we walked out, drove to La Grande Orange on 40th St. & Camelback (known for it's fantastic gluton-free pizzas) and had a wonderful time. 

Note to Cibo:  for a restaurant that RUDELY tells you they can make anything gluton-free, and at $15 to $16 for a small pizza, you'd think you would make enough dough that you could afford to throw some out rather than run short on a weekend night!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is enough to make me want to come in, but the food and service is what has me coming back time and time again! The deserts are really amazing too! They make amazing pizzas and one of the best spots in Phoenix by far!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Lunch was good, but not great.

We ordered a salad, three pizzas (everything sans the margherita pizza) and two sandwiches( PLT and one w/ meatball)

Anything with prosciutto in it was a little too salty for me. The salad was good with cherry tomatoes and mozzarella.  The pizza were mediocre. They were very soggy in the middle while being slightly burnt on top. Lastly, the sandwiches were good, but the PLT was too salty.

This place is probably better for dinner."}
{"text":"This meal count not have been any better!! From the bread and olive oil, to the pizza, and the mascarpone berry crepe, everything was SO DELICIOUS! The house salad was the best tasting house salad I've had with shaved Parmesan and fresh tomatoes. And the service was absolutely excellent!"}
{"text":"The things that stuck out for me with Cibo are the great staff and the warm, cozy ambiance that this little house-turned-into-restaurant provides.

Our waiter was on top of things, from taking drink and food orders, to bringing the cake out (we were there for a birthday).  He even said the menu items in a very distinct Italian accent, which always makes me giggle a little bit on the inside.  Tell me you've never said \"It's a me, Mario!\" in your best Italian accent.  When I went to the bathroom to wash up (the men and women bathrooms are single occupancy), one of the waitresses told me to just hop in the women's if it was empty.  Little things like this really help to give this place a cozy, inviting feeling.

On to the food.  The pizza was pretty good (though I found the crust to be a bit on the salty side), and the appetizers were excellent.  I had the geneva, which consists of basil pesto, potatoes, white onions, parmigiano and probably some other stuff that I don't remember.  But it was good.

My only minor complaint was that our table was a little cramped.  Certainly not Cibo's fault, since we were a party of 13,  but just something to consider if you go with a large party.  If it's cool enough outside, the patio would be perfect."}
{"text":"I just cant make up my mind which place I like more Parlor or Cibo's? I love them both but for different reasons. I can walk to Cibos and that's a plus. Parlor doesn't have a long wait and they have a lot more seating inside with lots of room. Both have great energy and the atmosphere is unique and very pleasant.  The service is Friendly and the owners are always there to meet and greet you,  very sweet couple. The food is amazing I love the salads and most of the pizzas. Cibo's has that intimate atmosphere when the weather is nice out. I like waiting outside by the fire pit  when its cold listening to the live band.  I also like the wine selection and drinking wine at Cibo's more than parlor probably because of atmosphere. Its a perfect place to take a date so you should check it out. They both are very delicious.

{"text":"Great authentic Italian pie.....amazing flavors. The wait can be a little long, but worth the effort. The strawberry and Nutella crepe with a scoop of vanilla ice cream was amazing."}
{"text":"Big group of 12 for late lunch on Sunday. Lots of space upstairs. Waitress was nee but very good - attentive & continually filled water glasses.

Sunday is half price pizza. I had Goat cheese pizza w onion, arugula, artichoke & eggplant (skipped olives). Pizza was bland. Way too much arugula & hardly any feta. I didn't find any eggplant. I tried a friend's pepperoni pizza but again, it was bland. She said that she only found 3 pieces of pepperoni. But the pizza crust was nice & thin.

Couple of friends enjoyed their salads."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place but was very disappointed.

Went with a friend and sat at the bar (my preferred location in most restaurants).  Did get good wine bottle recommendation.  Bartender recommended we each get a pizza as one was too small.  My friend is a social butterfly and makes friends with everyone else at the bar (fortunately) and we kinda decide we'll share each other's pizzas.  We each order a pizza.  Here's where things start going badly.
1. The pizzas are large enough to share between 2.
2. My friend's pizza (white pizza with some stuff and truffle oil).  WAY too much truffle oil as we can't taste anything else.
3. My pizza doesn't arrive.  A few minutes later I ask the bartender where my pizza is.  \"Should be out any minute\"
4. 10 minutes later - \"Should be out any minute\"
5. 15 minutes later - \"Uh, we are making it now\" - Note that all of these were at my request for an update, not proactive by the bartender.

Since we shared pizza amongst the bar, I don't want it anymore.  I tell the bartender to stop the order.  \"uh, ok, we won't charge you for it\".  No kidding!!

The other pizza's were good but not great.  I did have some spaghetti from one of the other bar mates and that was better than the pizza.

Maybe sitting at the bar was a mistake.  I wouldn't go back anyway."}
{"text":"This pizza place is incredible. It has a wonderful atmosphere, out of this world good pizzas, and delicious pasta. If you can ever get their squash pasta dish, DO. It gets crowded; arrive early or come late. Order wine--they have a great selection."}
{"text":"Excellent homemade pasta and relaxing atmosphere.  So glad I live downtown so I can walk here and get my fix :)"}
{"text":"\"Kismet: 
(Islam) the will of Allah 
- kismat 
An event (or a course of events) that will inevitably happen in the future 
- destiny, fate\" 

That's the word that popped into my head after a wonderful evening at Cibo. A motley group of friends met up for dinner and left very, very happy. 

We met around 7pm at Cibo. We were immediately seated at the front of the house next to the bar. The bartender was our waiter and he was super friendly and very helpful. We decided to each order a pizza so that plates could be passed around and pizzas shared! I'm glad that was what the decision was because I tried several different pizzas that night. 

The server was very helpful in selecting the wine that I chose to drink that night. He asked me what I liked to drink as far as American standards and suggested great Italian wines. He even came to suggest certain pizzas as well as aperitifs! 

I ordered the Bruschetta... it was delicious. The entire table enjoyed that appetizer. Once the main meals arrived, we realized that appetizers weren't needed. 

For my meal I ordered the Prosciutto Crudo. The dough was well cooked but not too hard that you could take a good chewy/smoky bite out of it. There were plenty of toppings and everything was high quality. I was amazed! 

At the end of the meal we just HAD to indulge in the crepes. I chose the Nutella and chocolate crepe....heaven. Of course I shared and everyone agreed that the crepe was amazing. 

To finish our dining experience off, we indulged in aperitifs of Lemoncello and some kind of yummy chocolate liqueur. 

Of course from start to finish I was happy. Our service was spot on, the food was FANTASTIC, and the drinks were wonderful. It was fate that our crew hit that spot right then, right there... I honestly do not have one complaint, one criticism, one bad thing to say about Cibo. 
I hope to catch a moment of kismet again!"}
{"text":"This place was so cute! I wish it was nicer outside to be able to sit outside on the patio. The food was great! It is a hidden gem! Their appetizers with fresh mozzarella was amazing! I had their pizza with no sauce and it was delicious! I will be coming back  here again."}
{"text":"Wow! Excellent food and great service! We were a party of 6 and everyone had excellent food! We had margarita pizzas, pastas, pork panini, meatballs, salads, appetizers and desserts- all was amazing and delicious- great ambiance- bummed we didn't get to sit on the outside patio. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Bruschetta: Great
Wine: Great
Ambiance: Great
Pizza: AMAZING. The Crust! The cheese! The Texture! The perfect taste! yum yum yum! 

 I typically get the Tricolre and sub tomatoes for the meat. But really, anything you choose is going to be AMAZING. 

I will spend my entire life hoping that I can find another pizza place as good as Cibo, and it will never happen."}
{"text":"Huh, so I'm clearly in the minority with this review. After hearing about this place repeatedly, I was excited to give it a try. End result was a \"meh\". For 6 of us, the total was $133. Holy crap! For pizza and iced tea?! Really?
I tried the asian pear, goat cheese, etc etc pizza--which was odd. That's really the only word I can come up with...not bad, not delicious, just odd. Also tried a slice of the sausage/potato combo as well. Again, not bad, but not amazing. 
Restaurant is oddly located as well, you're driving along...and then there it is, in a corner house. Most of us drove past it and had to circle around.
Likely won't be going back, but don't think they'll miss me, since it was packed on a Wednesday night. 
Large restaurant, but seems like a small space. People were constantly bumping into each other, some guy was almost sitting in my lap while he was waiting for a table (and I was eating), employees were weaving in and out of people and crashing into each other.
They have pasta specials on Tuesday and Wednesday nights and other random specials on Thursdays (according to the menu)."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. The most recent time we decided to have a group of 10-12 for dinner and they were pretty busy. Despite that the food was quick and service was pleasant. Great selection of beers and the pizza was great (we tried a significant portion of the menu). Definitely worth checking out and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Arizona, almost as good as my favorite place in Seattle. Cool ambiance, great food, just an interesting place to be. I'm also a sucker for old restored buildings. They make an amazing white mushroom truffle oil pizza - and I hate mushrooms. Eat here!"}
{"text":"This place has the best spinach salad. I had a great visit here with my husband. We split a pizza and salad and crepe. Love this place"}
{"text":"Well, I have been to Cibo several times and I don't think a month goes by that I don't get the craving and desire to drive 40 miles just to taste the food and enjoy the awesome atmosphere at this restaurant!  Truly deserving of the 5 stars!  Very reasonable prices, excellent food and just the best way to experience what a great restaurant should be."}
{"text":"Mmm.  Mmph. Mmmmm. 

So freaking good.  I've never been wowed like this in a restaurant.  Every dish is pretty unique,  but all were good.  I have had the veal with the sweet mashed potatoes and something tempura.. 

I will be back here to munch another day."}
{"text":"The place was packed and with good reason: just had the best pizza ever! Love the variety of people that come here, it's a colorful mix of shorts and flip flops & Sunday best."}
{"text":"the perfect spot for a lunch meeting - close to the city center but away from the hustle and bustle.  the quiet outside patio is nice for a breath of fresh air before returning to the recirculated air of your office tower.

the lunch menu is affordable and delicious!  i highly recommend the eggplant parm or meatball sandwiches with the house salad! (if you are dining with a friend, try ordering both and sharing half/half on the sandwiches)

the pizza and antipasto on the evening menu is top notch as well!  a great spot for casual group dinners or an intimate dinner for two. love this place!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to go. In fact my fiance and I are actually going to get married there this year!

The service is great. People are nice / pleasant people. The ambiance of both inside and outside is excellent & so is the food. At night Cibo serves pizza (and gnocchi pasta on most Tuesday nights, call first though to ask).  On weekdays they are open for lunch and serve amazing sandwiches, the bread is based off the pizza dough. But no pizza during the day.

We love the pizza! Our favorite is the sausage / \"Salsiccia\". The sausage itself is exceptional. It's a thinner pizza, but not a hard crispy bottom. The sauce is not one of those over-spiced sauces, it is mellow and very fresh. They have an excellent wine selection. My favorite right now is the Barbera (spelling?) that they carry.  Just like most places, if you are there with a few people, it's a better deal to just get a bottle.

Favorite salad, the Pear Salad.  Spinach leaves, light balsamic dressing, pears and pecorino cheese (kind of like a hard parmesan cheese). It's so good!  Also anitpasto plate is also great, but getting two appetizers might be much here.

They serve crepes for desert. If you have room, go for it. If you like desert crepes, and who doesn't, you won't be disappointed. The nutella / banana is our fav.

Excellent place to bring  a date."}
{"text":"I was so hyped up about this place, but the experience didn't live up to it. We came here at night which seems like the best time to come. The ambiance and decor was very romantic when we sat on their outside patio. However, the food was mediocre. The pizza we ordered was far from amazing...prosciutto crudo. The base of the pizza tasted plain with prosciutto just thrown on top. Our salad was good. And it also felt like we were forgotten for a while since they sat us outside. We hardly saw our server, but when we did, she was very kind and accomodating. I would recommend this place if I was going on a first date and food didn't matter to me."}
{"text":"Love taking a drive into the city for this gem. The caprese salad is so yummy! The margherita pizza is also something you need to try. I love the live music atmosphere and sitting out on the veranda at night."}
{"text":"Staff was a bit pretentious but that was the only flaw here. Sit outside if you can!! Feels like a little Italian Villa ;) lovely"}
{"text":"Cibo I love your salads and pizza. Your ambiance is tops what more can I ask for. I keep bringing more friends here as you never disappoint."}
{"text":"So, I ate here the night of the Pickwick show and then again a week later, and I can confidently say I'm a huge fan!

My dining companion and I sat inside in a cute little corner of the restaurant.  Our server, Tom, was great! Attentive but not hovering, funny, and accommodating.  

I ordered a glass (or two) of the Pillsbury Wild Child, which is one of my faves!  We started with the grilled veggie plate (lots of tasty grilled/chilled veggies lightly drizzled with olive oil and a side of bread), then we ordered a mushroom pizza on the gluten-free crust.  We asked Tom if we could sub goat cheese for the cow stuff and he totally made it happen.  What a guy!  It was effing delicious, I couldn't even tell the crust was sans gluten.  

The look of the place and adorable, very cozy and cute.  Good location and really nice for a date:) I'm sure most of you have already enjoyed Cibo, but if you haven't....well, get yourself together and head down!"}
{"text":"This review is for the weekend brunch...
I LOVE Cibo for dinner, it is one of my favorites downtown. I assumed their brunch would be just as good. 
We decided to sit inside as it was a rather warm morning and we walked (trying to burn some of the calories we were about to consume). We sat at a table right buy the window over looking the patio (which is dog friendly). As we perused the menu a fly kept buzzing around the table. I understand flies get in and I'm OK with that, BUT this one fly turned into about 8 full sized flies and a million little gnats. I was actually killing the bugs as they flew around our table there were SO MANY! We even had some fall in our drinks. Ugh!
The food was good. we ordered the Uova Arizona and Fritatta Melfitana. They were both good but the Uova Arizona was the best. 
I am so sad that the flies ruined an otherwise wonderful breakfast. I guess we should have sat outside...there would have been fewer bugs."}
{"text":"Cibo is a cute restaurant in a historic house in downtown Phoenix. Parking  can be limited to parallel street parking but it's worth it. The house salad that comes as a side to sandwiches is delicious. I love the cheese in it. I usually get the grilled cheese and it is soooo rich and delicious. The hint of mint makes it very unique. The iced tea is delicious. The only drawback is the service - it seems to be either hit or miss here. I've had more misses than hits unfortunately!"}
{"text":"Yep--this is my first and my last stop in Phoenix EVERY SINGLE TIME!  And I always order 2 salads--the Ostia and the Pesto--with extra potatoes and parsnips.  So good!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. The environment is nice the service is great and the food is excellent?.  I always want to order something different but always can't resist the Fra Diablo Pizza. It is to die for...has just enough kick to it without overpowering?. My husband always tries?something different and always lets me try. Never tasted anything that wasn't great. Give CIBO a try you will love it. Oh yes and often there is live entertainment!!!! Just another plus!!!"}
{"text":"Imagine if House of Tricks and La Bocca fell in love and had a baby. Cibo would be their love child. Classy, great vibe and delicious food are some of the highlights to this charming little restaurant. We had a big group and even two that arrived late and the staff was able to accommodate everyone. We ordered at least 5 pizzas and everything was fresh and flavorful. They have a good selection of drinks as well. I wanted a white wine spritzer and they didn't have club soda so I was offered sprite instead to mix with my wine and it actually tasted great! For dessert we all shared one that had nutella AND bananas. Mmmm. I would definitely come here and again and recommend it to all my friends."}
{"text":"Pizza, service and nutella shake are always perfect . I have been to this place many times and will continue to go. In my opinion, they have the best pizza in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Our family group was very happy dining on the lovely outdoor patio, though the service was inattentive, and the food quality inconsistent. Our waiter barely looked at us when he occasionally visited the table, and requests for this or that seemed to fall upon deaf ears, more often than not. However, he did have an efficient and personable young woman helping out, who pitched in now and then to keep ball rolling, luckily for us. 

The pizzas looked lovely, but the salads seemed rather more thrown together, than appealing. After the main course, about half of our used and stacked (hint, hint!) dishware hung out with us while we waited on a few desserts to arrive. Requested to-go boxes arrived haphazardly, in dribs and drabs, necessitating repeated requests. The dessert crepes were delicious, though, particularly the one with fresh fruit, cream, and ice cream. 

Overall:

Venue: Charming
Service: Crummy
Food: OK to Good"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza...and burrata! Unfortunately they were out last time I was there. I would come to phx just for that cheese."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. Service was amazing. Our server was Kelsey and she was exceptional. Very well versed on the menu extremely friendly and overall A++ for her attentiveness in a already packed restaurant. The food was timed perfectly as we ordered 3 apps and main meal.  Dessert and expresso topped of the phenomenal meal.  Kudos to all the staff at Cibo. We will be repeat customers here for sure."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for his birthday and the food was AMAZING! ! we had the calamari, with the tartufata pizza along with the banana Nutella crepe with a scoop of ice cream and my hubby had the Suzette. Everything was so tasty, the service was great we definitely left there very satisfied."}
{"text":"Cibo is amazing! The atmosphere and service are incredible. The food is to die for! The meat and cheese board was the best I've had! A great selection or meats cheeses veggies fruits and even arugula salad! Love the pizza, meat balls, and of course crepes for dessert. Can't go wrong with a Nutella crepe. But the fruit crepe with marscapone is also a favorite!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. The restaurant is in an old house or what looks like an old house. It's cute, quaint, cool, romantic. The moment I walked in, I thought I'd be going back frequently. But the food is very so so. The pizza crust tastes good but is far too chewy. The meatballs (we got them as an appetizer) were too large and too uneven in consistency. The meat didn't appear to have been blended thoroughly with whatever other ingredients they used. And everything was a bit cold. This all might be okay in the far flung reaches of Mesa. But if you are going to be down the street from Bianco and Pomo, you need to get this stuff right. They didn't."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the vibe of this place! We stopped by for lunch and it was extremely fast. I ordered pizza, which was good, but I've had better pizza elsewhere in Phoenix. That being said I've heard Cibo recommended for their sandwiches, so I'll have to give them a shot next time. I will be back."}
{"text":"Please make sure you visit Cibo at least once for lunch and once for dinner - the menus are completely different and are equally delicious and enticing. 

I love the pizza at Cibo, and I'm not really a pizza-girl. Everything is so fresh and they've got a nice selection of wine. 

I work very nearby and finally was able to take my husband there for dinner. At first he was wondering where in the world I was taking him, but he was incredibly happy with the feel of the restaurant and the quality of the food. He told our waitress, \"This is the closest to Italian pizza I've had.\" We had been to Italy about 5 years prior and he was desperately hunting for something remotely reminiscent of the Margarita Pizza we had in Florence."}
{"text":"I know what great pizza is. I really do. I'm from NYC and I've been to a lot of pizza places. The pizza here is just ok. It really isn't amazing. Maybe I came on a bad night? I even tried their crepe. It's too dense, not light enough and also just a shy too sweet for me, I got the raspberry and nutella. I don't know, I met a couple from Michigan and they thought the exact same thing as me so I'm pretty confident I didn't come on a bad night. Maybe I'd come back to give it another try if someone else invited me. Maybe I just got the wrong kind of pizza?"}
{"text":"Had our first visit to cibo last night. It is in a charming house in down town phoenix. Fabulous atmosphere! Warm, inviting, very unrestaurant like. Our waiter made some excellent wine reccomendations. We started with the Burrata. This was amazing....so simple yet so delicious. Two giant scoops of this mild, creamy cheese drizzled with balsamic, served with toasted bread and proscutto. Creamy, crunchy, salty....so perfect. We ordered two pizzas and a calzone. The names of the pizzas escape me, but one had sausage and potato, the other red sauce and walnuts and the calzone was filles with meats. Everything was simply divine. I love food that is simple, made with quality stuff. That is exactly wht we got. The crust is thin, chewy and has the char spots expected with woodfired pizza. I can not wait to come back to try something else!"}
{"text":"My sister and I came to visit my cousin in Phoenix. We came in with no dining expectations.

Our first meal was at Cibo, and it far exceeded our expectations.

First of all, dining al fresco in Phoenix is a \"thing.\" A lot of restaurants have outdoor seating, and especially on nice, warm nights, it really adds to the overall dining experience. The ambiance at Cibo is amazing. There are lights strung in the patio, with the lowkey sounds of a live band in the background.  We were fortunate enough to be blessed with a nice, warm, May evening, so everything really worked in our favor.

The pizza at Cibo is amazing. Amazing. I can't emphasize that enough. We ordered the pizze rosse diavola (tomato sauce, mozzarella, spicy salami and ricotta) and thepizze bianche tartufata (mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, white mushrooms and a drizzle of white truffle oil). Both were delicious- savory, and packed full of flavor with every bite.

I'd come back to dreary Phoenix just to have another slice of one of these pizzas."}
{"text":"Busy spot, but the food is great. Love the rustic pasta selection in particular! Good range of wine and beer to choose from. 

Great for a satisfying casual dining experience. Friendly, non-pushy service is a plus."}
{"text":"The food was great!  We were able to get in and food fairly fast.  The pizza was amazing as was the Banana/Nutella Crepes!  We will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"An intimate little restaurant that was just the right spot for a date. We had a lovely evening, and the pizza was delicious."}
{"text":"It should have been better.

The staff were terrific and so is the setting.  Unfortunately, the food did not measure up.   The pizza was lacklustre, the pasta so so and the swordfish dish was embarrassing.    

There are many other Calgary restaurants that do it better."}
{"text":"Went here after seeing it walking by to the place next door. This is by far my new favorite pizza joint. It's a casual but still nice dinning experience. Perfect pizza paired with a very intimate atmosphere.  Great drink specials as well."}
{"text":"I am so happy I got to try this place. I must have been living under a rock because I had never really heard of Cibo much before, but wow. I cannot wait to go back now!

The atmosphere is just perfect. Our part actually sat outside, which the patio is just beautiful on a AZ October night. I didn't even feel like I was sitting in Phoenix. The restaurant is in a cute historic house and the patio is filled with older trees and plenty of plant life. There was even a cute little white cat running around. I felt like I was sitting in someone's grandma's garden. Someone's grandma who makes kick as freaking food.

For dinner, my party of three of us split the 3 Pair Bruschetta. The waiter made it sound like it was going to be small, but it's not. These are three GOOD sized pieces of bruschetta topped with a ton of toppings. I really enjoyed the Prosciutto one. Melt in your mouth good. Then we split the De Notte pizza. It was a white pizza with spicy salami, mozzarella and tomatoes. The top of the pizza was burnt just enough to give it that perfect flavor. I don't remember the last time, if ever I had a pizza THAT good. I was a little disappointed we didn't get to try a red pizza, but we were plenty full from the appetizer and main entree. Not too full to split a nutella crepe topped with vanilla ice cream..oh yeah baby, can't go wrong with a little nutella in your mouth. That's what she said.

Service was great. Our waiter was quick, despite how busy the place was. He was very friendly and very helpful, except for telling us the brushetta was small not that I'm complaining :). And I think the price was very right. I couldn't believe how inexpensive dinner was for 3 people and all the food plus drinks we had. Very reasonable. I plan on taking the husband there soon!"}
{"text":"Well the big fuss was overrated, however it is an ok place to dine with friends. The crust nothing to brag about but it's home made ,very nice.  The Orr of the place is a winner . Loved the  verify of dish to choose from. Will recommend to others just not Ooooo a must gotta go there recommendation ."}
{"text":"This is the BEST food I have had in Phoenix! Their margherita pizza is so delicious with big fresh basil and they use good moz and great crust. Very fluffy and soft! I also tried their strawberries and goat cheese salad, very fresh and refreshing!! Their nutella and marscopone crepe was AMAZING!!! I wanna come back here every other day! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Cibo's patio is just so pleasant night or day! This charming old house lends to a quaint and comfortable restaurant both inside and out! The pizzas are what Cibo is known for and they are delicious. Good for all ages and most taste buds!"}
{"text":"Cibo is good but it's no Bianco. House salad was one of the best I have ever had. Pizza crust was perfectly thin but the pie was underdone. Sauce is mild but that's the way I happen to like it. Best way to enjoy this place is outside dining. Inside is loud, echoing and the background music is annoying to say the least. Ya, it's good but not worth a return trip and a long wait for an outside table."}
{"text":"This historic little house has charm oozing from every wall and corner. It is set up in such a way that you feel like you're having a quaint and intimate meal at a friend's home. The husband and I found our way here for brunch on Sunday afternoon just before it closed at 2pm. Service was great and the food was delicious. My husband had the pulled pork sandwich which was tasty. I had the Prosciutto e Funghi crepes and loved it. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. 

We were disappointed that they weren't serving pizza but we learned that they only serve pizza after 5pm. We have heard legendary things about their pizza so we will probably be back this weekend to make sure we get a taste."}
{"text":"Cibo's is SO good! They're pizza is delicious! -1 star for customer service. Kinda slow and not very personable but still nothing too bad. LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service from all areas- bussers, hostess and waitress were all friendly and attentive! The pizza is delicious, but be sure to save room for a nutella banana crepe."}
{"text":"I love Cibo! I always love to come here for my birthday because it has such a wonderful ambience. I like the Margherita pizza! It's simple, but delicious! It's a really special place in a cute Downtown Phoenix neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Really liked the pizza! Would recommend! Sit outside if possible."}
{"text":"This is in a cozy place that used to be a home & the atmosphere is enchanting. I love the charm that was kept when turning this into a restaurant. 
I have been here a couple of times. First time was to celebrate my b/day & it was with another couple. We ordered 2 pizzas & salads & shared. The salad was really goo-ood. The bar service was a little slow. Over all a good experience & we made it back. The second time we were seated in the bar area & the wait for everything this time was tremendous. We ordered the 3 Pairs of Bruschetta & it was phenominal btw.... I would eat that every single day. We also had the Tartufata pizza which was good but this time I was beyond irritated with the wait for everything. Long wait for drink order to be taken, longer wait for appetizer/pizza order to be taken, refills on water long, extra long wait for drink orders, etc etc There was seriously  a couple seated after us in the same seating area with a different wait staff that was served & left while we were still waiting for the check. Very disappointed in the service & deflated after a long day of work & spending 2 hours for an appetizer, pizza & 2 beers is not the way I went to spend my evening. This was not on a busy saturday night either. We returned to the lot behind the restaurant & some schmo parked behind us. The hubs had to go in & have the party located so we could leave. Apparently this is norm because there were other cars double parked. RIDICULOUSNESS! I won't write Cibo off today just because a staff had a bad night or because I didn't know that double parking was expected in the lot. I now know that I should park on the street not the lot but if the slow service is consistant with either the bar or wait staff then sad faces I will have to abandon that delicious Bruschetta which is the only reason I gave 3 stars."}
{"text":"Great little place for small groups of people. The parking was hard to get, but by the time we got in and ordered; it was worth it. We grabbed a seat at the bar because it was quite busy.
Food tasted pretty good and filled us right up.

The atmosphere was nice after getting outside to hangout for a bit. There was live jazz music playing and a warm fire to sit near."}
{"text":"Cibo is romantic!  Romantic as hell! Dimmed lightening everywhere.  Perfect date night!  Perfect solo date night!  Soft music playing.  Greenery and plants in plain sight.  Homemade sauces made with Love.  You can smell it.  You can taste it.  The serving sizes are huge!  A party of 2 really should split everything.  The salads are huge, share it.  The pastas are huge and heavy, share it.  The desserts are rich, fulfilling and huge, share them too.  Everyone walked around with a smile.  That made the place feel really warm.  We dined pretty late, about an hour before closing time.  At no point did we feel like we were rushed out or impeding on everyone's time.  We loved the restaurant, the food and the dining experience."}
{"text":"I can say the lady that served us was amazing ( tattoo on her finger) polite and funny. The appetizers was really good and the other food that our family had was excellent. The spaghetti with meatballs was not what I would recommend at all...."}
{"text":"Ask for the vegetarian cheese board :-) they made it veggie just for us. 10/10, but would benefit from some jam or honey as well for a sweet/savory mix."}
{"text":"Yasmin was amazing! Didn't pressure and made sure we had everything we needed. The food was absolutely amazing and the fries are to die for! Will definitely come again soon."}
{"text":"The best food and experience ever!  Ask for Ross as I believe he invented the menu!  He shared his vast knowledge of what is popular and what he recommends. When he spoke, he spoke with a luv and passion for the food. He spake as if he was eating the food in a dream and it was awesome. We ordered his recommendation di notte and the pacido pizza. WOW WOW WOW!  It truly was the best and authentic pizza that u can get. We would know, my wife and the other couple both lived in Germany for 3 yrs and we miss the food and culture. This truly was like we were back in Europe. 

I read another review about threaten being warm to drink, not with us!  Ross changed our water bottle 6x and even brought us ice on request. 

The deep fried rice appetizer is what u need to get as well. We also had to try crepe because they r the best. Again, Ross said they were big and we not be able to eat it all because they were so big. He was right. My wife and I could not finish it. But again, it was made to perfection. The presentation was just something to experience. 

I can't wait to treat my wife to the best night out here again in the future."}
{"text":"I had read some reviews about this place, and between those and my prior love for pizza, I knew I had to give it a try.  Sadly, it took me way to long to get here.

I actually took the GF & my parents there for a joint dinner.  They had never met before, and I was really banking the success of their meeting on Cibo's food and ambiance.  I can honestly say, mission accomplished!

Not that the restaurant had anything to do with the weather, but we had an amazing table outside (the only way to go here), under a tree in what turned out to be a cool Saturday afternoon. That was only the beginning.

Our appetizer plate was amazing, and definitely enough for four people to share.  This plate had enough variety, that even the pickiest of parents found something he/she enjoyed.  

We all order pizzas, because none of us really knew how big they'd be.  The crust, cheese and toppings were everything we could have wanted. Crisp, warm and delicious.  The pizzas are big enough for two, and I'd actually recommend sharing with someone else (unless you want leftovers) because dessert is the best here.

You won't find many places that serve Nutella, let alone in homemade crepes.  The crepe with Nutella and banana was unbelievable and is a destination dessert in itself.  I'll come back just for that.  We also split one limoncello drink, which was so strong.  The parental unit was flying high after just sipping that once!

All in all, this place is excellent.  It is totally tucked away in a cool neighborhood, and is a great place for a date or to feel like you are escaping the suburban sprawl in PHX."}
{"text":"Pizzeria Bianco (bear with me here) was the first bad review i wrote on yelp. And one of the few.

On a friend's suggestion, our faith in old-house-come-traditional-pizza-joints was restored when we came to Cibo.

I can honestly say that I've tried every pizza, salad and antipasto on the menu and have never been less than delighted by any of it.

Top it off with consistently good service and a great value, and Cibo has us coming back once a month if not more often."}
{"text":"Today is 1/2/2018 I am on the lovely intimate patio visiting with friends.  The service by Tommy (not to be confused with the amazing musician Tommy Connell) the server at Cibo is lacking table service. Has been asked several times for beverages.  Also disappears before we can order.  I had to have another server come take our order. Very sad that each time I come the service has been underwhelming. 


Previous review below.  

I went  to see a local musician named Tommy Connell last Sunday. The patio was lovely. Dimly lit with white lights and large trees. Thankfully we could still use the heaters as it was also cold out from the rain earlier that day. Tommy played a variety of classics and some originals on his Gretsch guitar. What an incredible sound and way to wind down after an intense weekend. He is a musical wizard as his fingers make their way across the strings. During his break he came over and chatted with my group. What a class act, a very humble man. A friend of mine mentioned later that he also won best jazz guitar for the Phoenix New Times. That is a award he certainly deserves. 

As per the restaurant itself. The food was delicious with large portions. The service started out very disorganised and quite unprofessional until about an hour in another girl took over and things ran smoothly.  I will be back though to see Tommy play again and will being a new group of friends each time. He is worth it!"}
{"text":"My family and I checked this place out after having an unsatisfactory Italian food experience elsewhere. We were very impressed overall with Cibo.

Starting with the place itself: it's home-y, well-lit, well-decorated, and just all-around cozy. It used to be an old house, and it definitely shows. Great patio seating, as well.

The food is next, and holy mackerel was it good. We got polenta fries and salads to start with. The salads had delicious and fresh ingredients, as well as gorgeous displays. I got the pesto salad, and would highly recommend it.
For entrees, my parents got a white pizza, and I split the pulled pork sandwich. Both were delectable, and we all had food left over to bring home.

The kicker is that they comped our desserts (about $15 worth). They said it was because they made us wait too long in between appetizers and entrees. It was a bit of a wait, but nothing crazy! The desserts were so good, too. The 'fresca' is a crepe with ice cream in the  middle, topped with fruit and whipped cream.

Next time we're in the area, we are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I went here a while ago and am just now reviewing it. This is a nice place with solid Italian food. For the price I wish they gave more food. I was able to finish my pasta which I typically am not able to do at Italian restaurants. We came with a big group of about 15 people so I didn't expect the service to be great. 
They also do not have liquor at this restaurant so if you are looking for some cocktails you are out do luck. Their water also tasted really salty and to me it was not drinkable."}
{"text":"I come here a lot as its close to my home. It is a casual and warm environment. Food is consistently good and fresh and the service is outstanding. I'm here right now, Tiffany is my server, and she's fabulous. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We had attempted to go to dinner at another little place a few blocks away, but were put off and decided to explore. Lucky we did cause I absolutely loved this place. We sat outside and it was very enchanting! I forgot we were in Phoenix for a while, which is a good thing. Phx needs more places like this! Our pizza was good, but I would have preferred a little more spice. Our crepe was delicious! I would go back for that alone! Overall, we had a great experience and hope to get back there before the summer hits us so we can enjoy the quaint patio experience:)"}
{"text":"Hello again. Ate here last nite. Myself and 2 firends. 3x's ive been here and its always busy. the other two x's we attempted to eat here. We didnt want to wait, so we went some where eles to eat. Last nite we waited for about 30minutes.  We were seated inside. and quickly ordered. I had the omero salad, one firend had sausage pizza and a glase of wine, and the other had pear salad. 
Ok food arrived promptly. my salad was good a bit on the small side for 11 dollars, but had lots of greens and onions, strawberries, and walnuts. it was good. my only complaint would be the candied walnuts........... couldnt even taste the walnuts too much sugar. When mentioned this too the waittress; She informed me that i could of requested plain raw walnuts and without any problem they could replace the candied walnuts with raw ones. That was nice to know. for the next time. My two firends both loved their food. I just thought mine and my firends salad were on the small side for 11 and 12 dollars. Other then that. Every thing at Cibo was very good. i recommend giving this establishment a try. I will be back. Just be prepared to spend 20 dollars or more. per person. Also depending on what time of day you go, be prepared to wait for a seat very popular with the  local folk. Lots of parties and groups coming and going. They serve wine and beer. not a full bar.  good place for eye candy of the both sexes. All ages here young and old.  Very nice atmosphere.

If if they offered organic whole wheat pizza they would get another star from me."}
{"text":"Cibo is a cozy little gourmet pizzeria hidden away in an old neighborhood. The pizza is excellent. I would encourage you to try anything on the menu, even if it doesn't sound appealing.  They really know what their doing and if they've put pear on a pizza, you better believe it was for a good reason. The ambiance is great, especially outside when weather permits. they have a respectable wine selection and this is a great place to take a date."}
{"text":"I have always thought of Cibo as a perfectly fine establishment - but it is the bunch they serve on weekends that really won me over! 
 
Their brunch menu conists of many egg (frittata) dishes, some crepes, and a few breakfast-style sandwiches.  Every item seemed to come with several side dishes and Nutella is always an option for your toast!! They don't have many vegetarian dishes, but what they do have they cook to perfection. 
 
The thing that really gets my panties in a knot is that they charge $6.50 for a mimosa!  How is a girl supposed to nicely toasty before noon at that price?! Take note that you can order an entire glass of wine for a mere $6."}
{"text":"I visited Cibo today for lunch with a coworker. We ordered the gnocchi and the fig/arugula/prosciutto pizza to share. Both were off the charts delicious. Gnocchi is one of those things that I'm afraid to order b/c when it is good....it's great but when it's bad....ick. Well, this was good...no, great. It is pan seared so you don't get any of the gloopiness that gnocchi can sometimes have. Served with garlic, spinach and cherry tomatoes, it was fresh and light and delicious.  The pizza was also very good with the crust done perfectly. No floppy, half done crust here!

Our server was knowledgable and attentive. All in all, we had a great meal. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The last few times have been terrible. Never going back. Bad service. Waiter didn't come to check on us at all after food was dropped off and I needed some oil and vinegar. She didn't even come back once until she was ready to give us the check. The oranges they use are from a can and taste terrible. The sandwich was all bread basically and no substance inside. We wanted dessert but we were so irritated that we skipped it all together. Not going back."}
{"text":"This place is overrated, sad to say. We have tried to get reservations here several times and each time is always a hassle and over the phone the staff always says the wait is at least an hour. We happened to get in for a party of 5 right away when we were in the area and were looking forward to finally trying the famous Cibo. The place is beautiful no doubt, atmosphere is 4 star but as far as the pizza goes you can get higher quality and price at The Parlor. We also had the calamari which was too tough and over cooked. The Parlors calamari was perfect and juicy. Our servers were also not friendly despite us only saying thank you whenever they stopped by our table. Of course, this was all just our one time experience but it did not leave a good impression."}
{"text":"I am giving this place a tentative two stars because I called to make a reservation tonight but nobody picked up the phone. Since it is Tuesday night, we decided to pop over to try it. We were astonished and disappointed to find the sidewalk in front of the restaurant all dug up and the place was closed. Management should have put a recording on the answering machine that they were closed. The holiday hours were on the answering machine."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend on valentines day after I read a review that said to skip the wait at Pizzeria Bianco (where we were originally going) and come here instead.  I am SO glad that we did!!! Our waiter James was absolutely amazing - very attentive, and knows a lot about the menu - you can tell he is very passionate about this restaurant and likes his job.  We ordered Bruschetta for our starter and it was absolutely amazing.  I don't even like tomatos and I couldn't get enough of their bruschetta board.  We then split a pizza as you can order half and half - I ordered their Trufeta (splg?) pizza - it has truffle oil - and is absolutely to die for!  We finished the night with a strawberry nutella crepe also very delicious.  We talked about this restaurant, the great service, the great food, and the great ambience for the rest of the night; and then took our friends there the following week.  Wish I lived closer I would go every day if I could.  Definitely skip the wait at Pizzeria Bianco and come here instead, the atmosphere is cozier, the wait staff is friendlier, and I think the pizza is way better!"}
{"text":"When the moon hitsa your eye lika big pizza pia, that's a cibo\" dont' doubt my sangin skills. Finally got a chance to check out Cibo tonight and man am I happy as a...well you get the rest.

Took wife and kids out for dinner before first friday.  I got this great glass or red called Valpolicello, which was AWESOME!  Wifey had a glass of Rose' that was legit.  We decided to have the pesto salad, Di Notte Pizza and Prosciutto Crudo. The salad was pretty good. I didn't taste much pesto, but it was still good. The crust on the pizza was something magic, seriously dope. The Prosciuto crudo was just like when I lived in Italy. Simple, straight forward and dope. Di Notte on the other hand literally tasted like buttered popcorn. No seriously, if you try it watch and see..not my fave. Overall the pizza was awesome, I'm stoked to try some of the other pies. They were busy but we managed to get an inside table right away, score!  If your looking for a legitamus prime pizza spot in cen-pho, you've found it."}
{"text":"Let me say right off the bat, the food here is phenomenal. The reasons I'm giving it such a poor review is everything I experienced this evening - outside of the food - was awful. They don't accept reservations which I think is a quack. Usually when a restaurant doesn't accept reservations, they have a bar area or a patio where you can sit, relax, and wait to be seated. Cibo has a bar - a tiny one - inside the home. There is almost no place to sit and wait to be seated for dinner. We arrived at about 7:30 and were told there would be an hour wait...I think it was closer to 75-80 minutes. As I was the oldest in my group with some health issues, I was the one chosen to get to sit in the one and only (metal) chair by the front entrance. I was thankful for that.

There was no wait staff who came by to see if we wanted anything to drink, so my friends and I waited the entire time, badly in need of refreshment.

We finally were seated on the patio about ten feet from a fellow with an electric keyboard. Call me old and cranky, but when I come to dine in a restaurant, I want to be able to talk in a low voice with my dining companions. Granted, we didn't have to yell to be heard with the music right next to us, but it was definitely hard to hear each other. 

We did receive our menus after about five minutes, but I think it was another 30 minutes before we got our meals. The waitresses did keep our water glasses filled which was nice.

Our table was metal, sitting on a paver-type floor, and was uneven. My friend had to keep her foot on the bar of the table to keep it from wobbling. The table had cross bars on either side so you couldn't even sit dead-on to the table. I had to sit sideways and was very uncomfortable. The chairs were horrendous...plastic, skinny, and barely enough room to seat your behind. I think those chairs are there to encourage you to eat and run.

I loved our food...we had the Burrata, the Tricolore and the Tartufta (sp?) pizze which was extraordinary. We didn't get dessert as we were stuffed.

I would return to Cibo but only when they first open. I don't appreciate restaurants that don't take reservations and then expect you to stand the entire time until you can be seated."}
{"text":"I had the cappricciosa, great toppings and the crust had good taste, would have been perfect save for the soggy crust."}
{"text":"Pure deliciousness. The pizza was wonderful and so was the strawberry and Nutella crepe! I would recommend this to anyone"}
{"text":"This is one of the best spots in Phoenix. The ambiance is cute and charming and the food is amazing. Just had dinner there this weekend with friends. Pasta is fresh and homemade, and the Diavola pizza is so good. Save room for a Nutella crepe. And you can eat here and then walk to the Van Buren so you can have dinner and a show."}
{"text":"I had lunch here this week for the first time. I happened to notice this place when driving by and decided to take a friend to give it a try as she always like this kind of place. The historic house has a wonderful atomsphere.  I had the spek and my friend had the vegetariano.  We were both impressed with the food, it was fresh and delicious. Service was very good also, my glass was never empty.  I look forward to coming back some evening and trying the pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza's are undercook. Will probably never come here again. Located on outskirts of downtown Phoenix. Nice for date night, but you may want to ask for your pizza to be well done."}
{"text":"Cane here tonight with my husband and were immediately welcomed by twinkle lighting and cozy dining outside. We enjoyed the delicious bread, amazing pizza, and a refreshing goat cheese salad."}
{"text":"Holy $#!T !! 

I'm not one to use profanity when describing a restaurant, but this place was absolutely amazing.  I visited back in March and loved the atmosphere, and recently returned to see if that was a fluke, or if Cibo is the real deal.

The food, top notch.  We got a pizza, pasta & crepe.  Everything was authentic, not from a box, and had fresh ingredients.  

We sat on the patio and it was secluded, quiet, and romantic.  A perfect end to the work week.

Thank you Cibo for creating a wonderful environment for fellow Arizonians to enjoy any day of the week!  We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Cibo is an amazing restaurant. Went there for a date night with my hubby for Valentine's night. Had great experience, patio was so so so romantic with all their little light and trees. Good singer and guitarist was playing quietly, it was such a great night ! 
Food was exquisite and wine excellent ! 
Would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  We love their burrata!  I've only been for dinner, but the service has always been good and the atmosphere great."}
{"text":"My first time here I loved the pizza, the second time was a horrible experience. I just recently ordered a lunch pizza with spinach, and they ended up forgetting to put it on till the last second, so when I bit into my pizza it was cold spinach. The pizza itself was so under cooked that the cheese wasn't completely melted and the dough was soggy. My first time here was over a year ago, I am going to assume they have just let there standards go since then, but they used to be a great spot!"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour!  We had the arancini and the meatballs. The arancini come 4 for $4.  They are deep fried rice balls with cheese.  They were very good (although I didn't care for the sauce they came with).  The meatballs were huge and you get 4 with 4 pieces of grilled bread for $6.  It was the perfect amount for the two of us.  I loved the sauce with fresh basil in it too.  They have a really cute patio, so I would recommend requesting an outdoor table.  I will be back at night to see the ambience of the patio in the evening and to try a pizza."}
{"text":"We came here for a double date night and as we stepped in, I absolutely adored the design of the restaurant. It was as though it was someone's house with multiple rooms, diverse paintings, and a beautiful outdoor patio. 

We all ordered pizza to share. They also let you do half and half on your pizza so you don't have to be stuck with one type. We ordered half Genova and half La Noce. Super delicious!!"}
{"text":"Best desert I have had in a long time.  Nutella crapes with marscapone.  Great place for pizza. Would love to see one or two more pasta dishes on their menu."}
{"text":"Really liked this place.  The ambiance was terrific - especially unique for the Phoenix area.  A great change of pace from the repetitive strip mall eateries.  The pizza was great, which is more than I can say for a majority of the other pizza joints I've tried in the valley.  We had a vegan in our group, and they helped her craft a pizza that aligned with her diet preferences.   Food came out quickly, server was personable and helpful, and the prices were quite reasonable.  We'd return."}
{"text":"Warm and cozy on a fall night.  Also PACKED shoulder to shoulder. One of my dinner counterparts suffered a clumsy patron spilling an entire glass of wine on her, so watch out on crowded Friday nights. The bar was very quaint and the beautiful bartenders were moving in overdrive to get as people served. 

Here's what we ate: 

Ostia Salad- Most delicious croutons ever! I loved the chick pea dressing.  I have experimented with making my own version, but have come no where close to this.

Genova Pizza- Potatoes on pizza is a great thing. 

La Noce Pizza- Not as wonderful as the Genova, but still a solid pizza. 

Both pizzas had a crunchy chewy crust, fresh sauce and herbs, and creamy cheese. I can't wait for another visit to Arizona to eat here again."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for date night. The outdoor patio is very impressive with lighting and trees surrounding us. The pizza was really delicious and they had a nice wine selection. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I went to Cibo for the first time since they've reopened under new management. IT IS FANTASTIC.

For a starter, we had the mussels. I can honestly say, they were the best mussels I've had in Pittsburgh. As an entree, I ordered the rabbit (first time I've had rabbit). It was delicious!!!! The wait staff were super friendly, and I loved the intimate atmosphere. I will definitely be returning!!!!

Don't let the older, negative reviews deter you from dining here. Those reviews are from before they reopened under the direction of a new chef. CIBO IS BACK AND BETTER THAN EVER!!!!"}
{"text":"Cibo, Cibo, Cibo! I'm here every few months. I love and appreciate all the gluten free efforts and options. I can't say that enough! The salads are so fresh and light, very delicious! The wine selection is nice as well as the option of champagne at a decent price. 

On this particular visit I was disappointed by the GF pizza for the first time ever! However, having had it so many times before, this was a fluke.  The Rustica is phenomenal as well as the Salsiccia, Diavola, and my favorite... the prosciutto crudo. 

The best part of the meal on any given night is, of course, the Nutella and strawberry filled crepes. I always have the gluten free crepes and nobody has ever been able to tell the different. The crepes are warm, soft, fluffy, and somehow hold up again getting soggy for longer than expected!! 

The restaurant is a converted house which is adorable and cute. However, this makes for a LOUD experience.  Everything is wood and the acoustics around bad. It's loud and hard to hear across the table."}
{"text":"I am STILL thinking about this pizza 1 day later, that's how good it is. Now, I've had pizza in Italy and Cibo isn't as good as that, however, it is some of the best I've had since Italy and was reminiscent of what I've had there. We came here on Wednesday night and the patio was packed and since we were pretty hungry we decided to not wait and just sit inside. I gotta say, it's a very cute place. I loved the decor, it felt very quaint and homey. The service wasn't the greatest, as our waiter was rather short with us and not too friendly.  The dessert did take a long time to get to us, but really we weren't too bothered by these things as the overall experience was a positive one.

Now, down to the good stuff... the food. My Husband and I shared a margherita pizza and a spicy salami white pizza. The margherita was to die for and the spicy salami was great with a nice kick. My favorite part of their pizza is the crust. It's is so flavorful and has great chewy and crispy texture. My sister had the special gnocchi, which was really good too. At the end we all shared the nutella and marscapone crepe, which was utter bliss. 

The prices were good, the food was awesome, the ambiance was delightful... we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Hey Az it's Analynn here with another fantastic place to try . I love these little houses transformed into restaurants ! This is a very cool place and if course the food is terrific and so is the service . Ask for outdoor seating if it's not too hot because the live entertain kicks butt !  Choose your group wisely to ensure your evening g is enjoyable . You will want to valet park because parking g is difficult down town. Sometimes valet parking is complementary . As always if you go let me know how your experience was . Enjoy"}
{"text":"One of the cutest date spots in downtown. I always get good service and their patio is adorable. I like to come and share a salad, pizza and bottle of red wine. I really can't recommend more than that since that's all I have gotten in the years I've been coming!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here last week. 

The patio is great and really fits the vibe of the neighborhood and the restaurant. 

Great pizzas and sandwiches.  Drinks looked great but had to go back to work. 

Valet parking is a plus!"}
{"text":"Holy mother of pizza. When I travelled to Phoenix on business and asked the Phoenix yelpers where to go, I was a little surprised so many people said Cibo. I was even more surprised when I saw how many reviews it had. Well, Phoenix, I understand now. I have seen the light. You have converted me to Ciboism.

It's. Phenomenal.

The location is in a neighborhood and it's obviously a converted house where the outdoor seating is actually on the front lawn with some nice lights in the trees. Very cool to sit outside on a cool night in Phoenix and enjoy great company and delicious food!

When I was looking at the menu I was so excited to see so many options for Pizza Biancha (white pizza!). I can't eat tomatoes so it was like a kid in a candy store for me. Once I saw the Di Notte I knew it had to be mine. A huge portion, wood fired pizza with fontina, pecorino, gorgonzola and mozzarella cheeses along with spicy salami. It was to die for. I enjoyed it at the table AND I enjoyed the leftovers. My co-workers even stole a slice each and couldn't stop ooo'ing and aah'ing over it.

One of my co-workers got a meatball sub which he swore up and down was as good as his authentic-from-Italy grandmother's. He said it might be sacriledge to say it, but it was true. My other co-worker had a half vegetarian and half ham and she said the whole thing was delicious.

For dessert, even though we were full, we couldn't pass up the opportunity to try the Nutella & Marscapone crepe. It was a warm crepe filled with nutella and marscapone cheese, covered in powdered sugar and drizzled with chocolate sauce, with a dollop of ice cream. It was sinfully delicious.

I completely agree that this might be the best pizza I've ever had!! Thank you Phoenix, and thank you Cibo!!"}
{"text":"Best diavola EVER!! I would recommend this pizzeria to anyone, it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Since there's over 200 reviews before mine, I'll keep it short.

Cibo is a cool place, with hip customers and an emphasis on quality.  The bruschetta appetizer is a winner.  See pic. Try to save room for the crepe desserts."}
{"text":"My daughters and I love this place. Very cute & friendly staff. Fats service, pizza is great & they absolutely love the Nutella crepes, strawberries & ice cream on top."}
{"text":"Good eats, pleasant staff.  Would recommend this quaint little eatery in Central Phoenix for sure.  Eating outside in the covered patio is quite the pleasant experience and the prices are very reasonable. Pizza and salads are their specialty so if this is what you crave in Central Phoenix you hit the spot!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in Phoenix, situated in the old historic district.  Cibo has great wines, great appetizer's too.  I recommend one of my favorite pizza's that is prepared just like you would have in Italy, the pizza con proscuitto crudo."}
{"text":"BYOP-Bring your own placemat. I used to think highly of this restaurant, but in a recent visit with my family I was very disappointed. After placing my arms on the table I felt them stick and that's when I tried to wipe them down and discovered both tables were extremely filthy (moist wipes were charcoal black after I was done). The waiter apologized and said that the ink from the menu causes that, but menus are kept inside a plastic pouch, so it must be magic ink. I'm definitely not coming back, as I don't want to begin to imagine what the kitchen looks like."}
{"text":"Good service and satisfactory pizza. It's not my favorite in the area, that would be pizzeria bianco! The loose leaf tea was quite yummy though. Meatballs were tasty with scrumptious sauce. I'd have to try other dishes before I could give it 5 stars. Still a wonderful and inviting place to eat. Would be romantic for couples and inviting for the family as well! Nice outdoor seating with live music."}
{"text":"Without a doubt this is my new favorite Italian restaurant!  The food was excellent along with the service.  For appetizers we got the flatbread with sausage and a side of olives... Amazing. Then I got a butter lettuce salad with radishes and truffle oil...excellent.  For my entree I got home made pasta with ricotta and sauce and basil... So fresh and wonderful.  One of the things I love about cibo is a choice of full or half portions!  We ended the meal with a piece of delicious orange zest cake with juniper cream and coffee!  My one daughter had mussels which she loved and my other daughter had beef a beef dish which she loved!  We can't wait to
Go back :-)"}
{"text":"After a phone reservation mishap with the Cibo folks I posted a not so stellar update to my review. The very next day, I received a personal and personable e-mail from someone who works there featuring an apology and an explanation of what had happened. WOW I'm impressed!!! this is not only a testament to Cibo for caring enough about their patrons and giving a whole new level of customer service, but also to Yelp for creating a true community that is not only among fellow yelpers, but among business owners and their customers...something that was completely unheard of just a couple of years back!! 5 starts to Cibo and 5 stars to yelp!"}
{"text":"Went last night for first time only because we had a gift cert.  Not impressed. Server was odd, table was crammed in a corner, flies everywhere ..... Just a weird menu selection.  We won't return."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place.  It is in a romantic little house.  It has a great wine list and the pizza is really good.  I think the pizza compares to Bianco's pizza, but you don't have to wait several hours to eat.  Big plus in my book!"}
{"text":"I brought my wife here for her birthday dinner and we loved Cibo! The atmosphere was amazing and the food was delicious! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I been meaning to go to Cibo for a while now and finally made my way over there. Atmosphere was alright, it was a bit loud (although this could just be the table we were at... which was kind of tiny and right next to the stairs..boo)

Our server was sweet, attentive and didn't seem bothered that I kept sending her away since I couldn't make a decision on which wine to have.

Speaking of wine, list was pretty good by the glass and everything on the menu sounded amazing.... After some thoughtful planning we decided on a few items to share: Beef Carpaccio, Lamb Meatballs and the Pineapple Pizza... everything was full of flavour and delicious, although I wish they didn't top the carpaccio with potato crisps and just gave you crostini instead.... but it was a new twist to an old fav.

And that's all she wrote folks."}
{"text":"We took my brother out for father's day here to Cibo this Sat night.

Our party of six had called to be put on the list and when we arrived, our table was ready for us... AND it was crowded and busy, so I'm very impressed that despite the busy evening, they were able to get our call-in table ready for us.

There are SO many reviews, I will just give you a few tidbits that stood out to me:
- there is no chicken on the menu, so if you're going to order a salad, forget chicken.. you'll get prosciutto or sausage but no chicken... but their Omero Salad was *outstanding*.. delicious and so flavorful and great mix of textures and flavors
- place is adorable, small and intimate.. and at a 100 years old, there's no sound absorption.. my cackles were resounding... I had to purposely laugh softly (very hard for me!)... FYI
- you can do half-half pizza orders...  I tried a slice of all the 5 pizzas at our table and found them all unique, flavorful, and definitely delicious
- their Il Tagliere meat and cheese board is a fantastic appetizer idea.. burrata was outstanding and loved by all

We would absolutely come here again!"}
{"text":"I ate here in January while at a work-conference in downtown Phoenix.  The meal and overall experience was perfect.  CIBO feels like a home, and I think it actually is a converted home.   

The staff is extremely nice, with a bit of hippie-quirky, which we enjoyed.  You could tell that they were passionate about food, fresh ingredients, and health.  The food was great (i had salad and a pizza), and the portion sizes were very large.  I would estimate 2 pizzas and 1 salad for 3 people next time.  I will definitely be back there whenever I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We visited some friends in Phoenix this past week and they took us here. The outside patio is beautiful with overhead lights and landscaping that makes you feel like you're not in the heart of downtown Phoenix. We had two different pizzas, a pasta dish, and a crepe. Everyone in our group was very impressed with the food, service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"In my disappointing and down right horrible experience with my last favorite pizza place, I decided it was time to set out and explore new horizons. Yelp brought me to this place and I found a little peace of heaven. 

I REALLY wish Yelp had 1/2 stars because this place REALLY deserves 4.5 rather than 4 stars, but not quite 5, and only by the slightest of margins. Here's why: 

Jessica was our server. She was FANTASTIC! It's a rare server these days that can identify a customer's pace, adjust on the fly, and not make you feel rushed in any way on a busy weekend night - Valentines day no less. Expertly done, Jessica! 

We were unable to get a reservation, so we put our name on the waitlist. They are very technologically forward and sent a text message when out table was ready. The allowed us to wait in areas other than the benches, the tiny house's foyer or the cramped bar. As we were waiting a musician began to play by the fire pit and we migrated there to listen. He was a wonderful choice, and it was quite an enjoyable wait time as much as wait times can be enjoyable. 

Once we were seated at our lovely table and someone brought us water (she wasn't the friendliest), Jessica then arrived, introduced herself and explained the menu. 

We started with the charcuterie board. It wasn't the best I'd ever had, but it was wonderful nonetheless and a good way to begin a lovely dinner. 

As I mentioned, my intent on visiting Cibo was to replace a horrible experience with another pizza place that will not be named. Therefore, I originally had come for the pizza, but I wound up with the pasta. I was not disappointed! The pasta itself was fresh and made in house, the sauce was subtle and amazing. The hubby got the pizza so I was still able to taste the pizza. It was very good and we had no leftovers. Which meant we were either famished or gluttonous as the servings are quite generous. Either way, we enjoyed our meals immensely. 

My 1/2 point deduction is really because of the bar and alcohol choices. To some this might sound nit picky, I agree, but it really bothered me. Their wine list and liquor list was surprisingly small and limited. I understand the difficulties in keeping a fully stocked bar and an extensive selection of wines - I'm not suggesting that. However, the selections they did have could have been chosen much better - better Italian wines, both red and white, and amoretto is a must. They do redeem themselves slightly with a HOMEMADE lemoncello. 

The ambiance, the music, the food, the service, were all superb. Making a very minor adjustment and choosing better selections in the wine and liquor department will make an enormous difference. 

Regardless, we will be back. If you haven't been, it's time to check them out!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Cuba before and not it was worth the money ($$$ - $$$$) range.

Mmmm sip sip sip at the healthy wine portion I've been served.  Hmm is this my first or second glass?

I don't typically eat ham but the prosciutto pizza had me stuffing my face and disappointed when it was gone.

Now what's really to die for at this restaurant is the fruit crepes.  They're HUGE and they don't skimp on the fruit or toppings. Nom Nom Nom Nom... polite burp.

Kiss kiss smotch from the girlfriend for taking her to a romantic spot for dinner.  Oh if the temperature is right sit outside, it's dimly lite with vegetation and hanging lights.

Not for the faint of heart in terms of $ but worth every penny you spend."}
{"text":"I love Cibo. I'm not fond of pizza and I don't like long Yelp reviews, but I've got to preface this with a ten-second backstory so you'll understand why I was there in the first place. I'll make it fast: 

Amanda M is one of my favorite Austin Yelpers, who has since transplanted to London. A couple of weeks ago she sent me a totally random text: \"I accidentally deleted all my pictures of a wonderful restaurant Andi & I went to in Phoenix, and I just want you to sympathize with me.\" Well okay then, I can do that. I feel your loss, been there, done that. Incidentally, Andi is Amanda's fianc√© and a cool guy. 

So here's how Karma works: Two weeks later I find myself in Phoenix, I have to eat somewhere, and I start thinking just because I'm a cool & sensitive guy, wouldn't it be fitting if I went to that restaurant and made a surprise photo montage for Amanda? Of course it would. That's what makes me a cool & sensitive guy. 

But what caught me by surprise is Cibo really is a remarkable place. It appears to be a converted house, and the outside patio/garden/dining area strewn with tiny lights is truly a wonderful place to be. On any given evening, it's easy to see why Cibo is a popular Phoenix destination. 

And it's also the best pizza I've ever had in a restaurant. I got a half Vegetariana and half Diavola, because Amanda said their spicy salami was really, really good. And she's correct. Perfect crust, perfect toppings. I'm pretty sure their cheese isn't coming from a can. The house salad and Nutella & strawberry crepe were just bonuses, and superb ones at that.

I wish I could be a little more specific on what made Cibo - and everything about the place - a wonderful and memorable experience for me. The quality of ingredients? The magical ambiance? The precise yet transparent service? Maybe it's as simple as completing my mission - I knew what Amanda's montage would look like before I even pieced the pictures together. And I posted it for you here. 

You know that classic storybook rhetoric about the planets lining up correctly, and then everything falls into place in perfect harmony? Well, that's pretty much how I felt walking into Cibo, and that's exactly how I felt walking out. I'm not sure it gets much better than that. In proper Yelpspeak, that makes Cibo as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Cibo is my go-to place whenever I have someone visiting from out of town. Cibo is a restaurant that embodies the downtown Phoenix food scene. Amazing pizza and wine. Never disappointed with the service!"}
{"text":"Finally I get a chance to wrote this review. And it really is with a heavy heart that I have to present Cibo with three stars. But in my opinion completely justified. 

My girlfriend and I decided to go there this weekend and revisit our first date spot. We live in Gilbert and this is a bit out of the way but we decided why not. This is one of her favorite spots so we made the trek. 

First and foremost I really don't understand why they would not take reservations unless it's a party of 6. We waited 45 mins to be seated. 

Once inside we were seated at a tiny table that is within body odor smells of the person next to you. In other words you are very close to other tables.  We also had the unfortunate pleasure of being seated between a drunken whiny birthday celebration in front of ya and a cackling hyena behind us. If you can mentally visualize this you will realize that it creates a very loud atmosphere. I literally had to shout a few times across the table. 

Now onto the pizza, what everyone comes here for. First I want to say that the Caprese salad is one of the best I have ever had. Anyways, we ordered the Tartuffata and Procida. The tartuffata came out with the crust and the bottom being burned. The Procida had some asian pear slices on it which were very tasteless. Furthermore when I grabbed the slice it seems soggy and wet the toppings all fell off. I was left with a soggy pizza slice. 

Needless to say we left a little disappointed."}
{"text":"This is some of the most authentic Italian pizza I've had in Phoenix The crust is baked to perfection, and the ingredients taste fresh and delicious. 

I've been twice and enjoyed the romantic courtyard seating both times.  It's perfect for a date night, but also great for a dinner with friends and family. 

As for portion size, the pizzas are big enough to split, especially if you get an appetizer. Save room for dessert as well! Last time I was looking for something smal and tried the cioccolatino--it was amazing! 

The only thing I would hope for is a more expanisve menu--maybe offering the sandwiches for dinner as well. Cibo does mean \"food\" in Italian, after all. :) I'd love to see what their pasta would be like!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat some yummy pizza! The calzone is HUGE and mouthwatering good! Such a cute and romantic place, too. If the weather permits, you must sit outside. The lighting and live music really make your dining experience unforgettable. Really can't go wrong with this place! Looooove :D"}
{"text":"Gluten free fruit crape with ice cream and chocolate  - Pick and Holler  Old Time Appalachian Music https://www.facebook.com/pickandholler; it doesn't get much better at Cibo's.  I love them both (great restaurant and great band). HB"}
{"text":"Apparently, I've not written my review of Cibo as yet.  Cibo has excellent pizza in a charming atmosphere - it's a great date restaurant, Girls-Night-Out restaurant, or \"Place to take your hip Mom\" restaurant.  Not a ton of testosterone here.  Which is fine, we're secure enough to come here and sit on the spindly little patio chairs and sip wine and munch on pizza and idly agree with the dining companion du jour about how cute everything is.  

I lied in the previous sentence.  I never munch on pizza.  Perhaps I shouldn't be hungry as I write this, but I tend to devour my pizza in such a way that embarrasses anyone with a good view.  I imagine it must be like a train wreck.  

The service here has some issues.  They always take care of me, per se, and they do it with a degree of aplomb, but I have gotten some attitude here previously.  Maybe they have elephantine memories and remember that time I brought my plastic cup of iced mocha from Fair Trade and refused to let them take it until halfway through my meal (I wasn't done with it!!!!) or the one time my friend asked if she could get a side of Ranch Dressing (not kidding, seriously you should know by now I honestly couldn't make this stuff up [to which request the waiter replied with a terse \"Umm, no.\"])  

I have yet to find the perfect pizza ingredients here - Diavolo is too spicy, other things I've tried are too sweet, not enough flavor, or have other drawbacks (vegetables, for instance) which prevent them from being favorites.  I guess I come back for the overall experience, despite the occasionally uneven service.  Plus, it's almost magically easy compared to Bianco's.  (probably the only comparison with Bianco's it will ever win)."}
{"text":"Damn good food. friendly service. And not too expensive either. I will return"}
{"text":"Not sure this place needs yet another 5-star review, but I can't help it. It's my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. The patio (especially at night) + atmosphere of the historic house are beautiful. And the salad, pizzas, and desserts are so delicious. My favorites are the Omero salad (or the Pear, also great), the Funghi pizza (although the Margherita is simple and tasty too), and the Fresca dessert. Only negatives are the lack of reservations and somewhat long wait if you come around 7-8pm. Totally worth it though."}
{"text":"One of the best patios in Downtown Phoenix. Love the atmosphere!

The salads and pizza are all amazing! It's my go to spot for lunch or a nice dinner. Romantic yet casual, this is one of my favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Cibo's spek (smoked prosciutto, mozzarella and tomato) sandwich is one example of its deliciousness, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Like seemingly every other decent restaurant downtown, it too, is in a historic house.

This review is for lunch only - which means the menu is limited to sandwiches, salad and dessert.  It ain't cheap, so expect to throw down $30 for two for lunch.

Lunchtime draws in the crowd - your downtown business and government drones. Patio seating would have meant a 15 min. wait, but since we were in a hurry my downtown drone buddy and I opted for an inside table.  The feel inside is a warm urban rustic.

The food was very good.  The pizza/panini bread used for the sandwiches is the standout here.  Freshly baked, warm and near perfect texture. I could have had a bread sandwich by itself and been just as satisfied.  I spotted an attractive fruit yogurt granola dish at a table next to me - turns out it's one of their side salads.  I highly recommend it.

Service was ok, but would have been better had I gotten my water when I asked for it upon ordering and not at the end of the meal after reminding the server.  An honest mistake.  No big deal.  Parking is lacking here.  With the exception of a tiny lot in the back, it's the streets, yo.  We ended up with a two block walk.  Not a big deal, but worth mentioning.

I would go back often for lunch if it was close to work. My chance for one of their pizza dinners is looking mighty good."}
{"text":"Not worth it, I had the ravioli, it had an entire bulb of garlic in it, and it was completed raw garlic as well. My partner had the chicken Alfredo, it was completely cold and tasteless. Could of had better at the Olive Garden"}
{"text":"I know Cibo doesn't need another 5 star review but they've been a favorite for years now and I wanted to share the love!

We've been with big groups, for date nights and everything in between and have always had a wonderful experience.  There is the occasional uber hipster server that feels the need to correct your pronunciation of \"bruschetta\" but the food always outshines those minor annoyances.

If you haven't been to Cibo, it's a must visit!"}
{"text":"Cibo was like that movie that everyone tells you is so awesome, but when you go to see it, it's just alright. Solid average experience. I had heard so many great things about this place, that perhaps there was a bit too much build up.

It was a bit of a wait on a weekend night, which is expected and not a huge deal. We sat on the patio, which is really pretty & has room for a lot of people, which is always a bonus in AZ.

Here's the thing, I can barely remember the pizza. No, I was not drunk. I had one glass of wine, shocker I know. It wasn't bad, it wasn't amazing, it was just decent pizza. Sure pizza is almost always good, but I expected much better that ok."}
{"text":"Stopped by because of all the great reviews . We ordered two small lunch pizzas and a salad . The Diavola & Salsiccia. Our pizzas were very blan tasting and was soggy . Every slice I tried to pick up it would flop over and all the toppings would fall off  . Another thing I didn't really like was that the sodas are in cans and are way over priced 2$ . Why don't they have a soda fountain machine and serve it in a large glass ?"}
{"text":"Everything here for lunch was amazing.  Great eggplant parm sandwich (recommended by the waitress) on that saltimbocca bread.  One friend had a sausage sandwich and another friend (vegetarian) had his usual, caprese sandwich; both raved about their food.  Price is right at about $9 per sandwich.  Too bad they don't serve pizza for lunch; I'll have to come back some time for dinner. We didn't have any problem parking or getting in (maybe a 10 minute wait for lunch, not bad), but maybe we just got lucky. I also really like the setting in an old house."}
{"text":"We just went here for the first time last week. 
First off the place is pretty small inside. We were a table of 4 put in the corner of this really small room with a ceiling fan. But there were so many people in this little room that it was warm so it made it uncomfortable. 
Our waitress was polite. A little timid which sometimes made her unhelpful but all in all she was ok. 
We got a appetizer which was this fried rice ball with cheese. Nothing special. Pretty bland.
And we got two different pizzas the margarita and the pesto potato one. 
The margarita pizza was awful!!!! It had so much sauce that was the wrong consistency on it that it made the pizza a instant droopy mess and totally soggy. It was gross. The pesto potato pizza was actually very good and it is what we ended up eating. The rest of everything else we just left there and was a total waste. 
We probably won't go back here just cause there is definite better options out there then the experience we had here."}
{"text":"Great little place. Can't go wrong with anything. Can't get enough of the tea. Ask for it to go!"}
{"text":"Might have found my fave resto in Phx. Cibo hearkens to the good life, often attempted but rarely found.

With its exceptional ambiance, Cibo belongs more in Sonoma than Phx... rustic charm w/an incredible eye for detail - menu, staff, and venue all with great character. The entire restaurant has an intimate, homey feel - from its candle-lit outdoor garden seating, to its wooden porch entrance, cozy seating inside.

Visited to sample their handmade pastas (Tuesdays), gnocchi caprese-style with cherry tomatoes, fresh mozarella. Was impressed by their extensive, reasonable wine list with unexpected finds.

Would return for their foodie pizzas, enjoy a glass of vino alfresco, and savor Cibo."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorites!
Food is great, and the ambiance is better!

This is the perfect place for date night!"}
{"text":"Friends of mine and I used to jokingly say that Cibo was where people went when they couldn't get into Pizzeria Bianco. However, as good as Cibo is, it isn't even in the same league as Bianco. With that said, Cibo still gets 4 stars from me because of the adorable converted house it occupies, the decent service, and pretty good pizzas. Not my favorite pizzas in the world, but they're not too pricey and they get the job done. I also enjoy their crepes for dessert and appetizers. Their beer and wine could use a little upgrading, and I stay far away from their limoncello (which is just too harsh when it should be velvety and smooth). I like to sit outside on beautiful Phoenix nights and soak in the smell of the desert, but only nights when there isn't any live music. And by live music, I mean the nights when second or third-rate Phoenix bands play half-assed cover songs in exchange for drinks from the bar...no thanks.

Good for special occasions, large groups, and for trying to impress your parents when they come to visit."}
{"text":"I've always been one to say, \"Pass!\" to pizza. But since it was my birthday, my friend took me here for dinner...and when someone offers to take you out for your birthday, who says, \"hell no, I'm not eating that!\"  So I went.

Let me start with the ambiance of the place. The restaurant is actually a house, it looked very homey. We opted to sit outside in front because it was late evening and we saw they had misters...plus, the decorations outside looked so romantic and sweet. Definitely a good choice for a first date! Or ...the 100th date. 

Now on to the food.  He ordered for us but I got to choose the dessert, and yes, I asked for it to come out FIRST.  It was a crepe filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with whipped cream and fresh fruit.  At first I said, \"damn, $12 for a crepe?\" Man, that was amazing.  And well worth more than $12.

We got two pizzas, they were about 8 inches around and it can probably feed a party of 2 (but since we had a huge crepe before, we had to take some pizza togo). My pizza had prosciutto topped with fresh, organic arugula. The crust was thin and very tasteful. I couldn't get enough of it. His pizza had salami, mushrooms, and mozzarella cheese. Also quite delectable.  Our waiter was very nice, he knew we were talkers so he left us alone to do so. After we were done eating, we wanted to get some coffee but it was 10:30pm on a Sunday night and no one was opened.  Again, our waiter came to the rescue and told us about a local coffee house down the street, about 5 minutes away.  We went there and it was amazing too!....but that's a different review.  :)

To say that I recommend Cibo would not express how I really feel about my experience there.  Let's just say, since that day, I've had dreams about my prosciutto topped with arugula pizza EVERY NIGHT!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!  Closest thing to NYC/East Coast Italian that I've seen here in the greater Phoenix/Scottsdale area for a reasonable price.  We had the meat antipasto with capicola, salami, olives, various cheeses, roasted peppers, etc. and it was fantastic.  Afterward, our group shared white and red pizzas as well as a calzone which were all delicious. The menu is somewhat limited but what they do, they do right.  The old-home atmosphere was charming-we had a private alcove for our small group. Walking by the small bar area, it reminded me of intimate restaurants in homes in CT.  We're going back when it's cooler to sit on the outdoor patio with the tree lights, misters and take in the ambience.  Oh and to top it off, our waitress was one of the best ever and that's saying ALOT.  We've dined in a few places in our lives and have a good basis for comparison...she was excellent (just which I got her name!)  If you haven't been, you have to try this place.  It's worth the trip. We went on a Monday night and were seated right away...I hear it's insanely crowded on the weekend...I know why...it's good!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place more stars, but can't because the staff and ownership are often so off-putting if not rude. 

On a positive note, the ambiance is excellent. It's an old house with dining on the patio. It's a good place to go on a date, especially in the Fall or Spring. The pizza is spot on Neapolitan style pizza.

The Marinara is vegan if you hold the anchovies. Ask to replace them with olives. 

There were a few friendly cats that live in the area when I visited and they would hang out with you while you ate on the patio."}

Best of 2007: Best Downtown Lunch 
Best of 2006: Best Gourmet Pizza 
Best of 2005: Best Gourmet Pizza 

These are just some of the awards that Cibo has won.
Well, this year, Cibo is being awarded its most prestigious award to date. 
And that is the Craig R's Favorite Dinner While Visiting Arizona Award 

Cibo, which is located in a residential neighborhood in Phoenix, is actually an old restored 1913 bungalow. The inside of Cibo has hardwood floors, beautiful stained glass paneling, an all wood bar and a fireplace. Since it was such a warm, beautiful Phoenix evening, my fianc√© and I decided to dine in the front yard of Cibo, which is covered with tables, Christmas lights and a fire pit. Cibo also has local Jazz bands come in and play live music in the front yard, which gives Cibo a super relaxing and romantic vibe. In fact, this was one of the most romantic evenings my fianc√© and I have shared in a long time. 

To start out the night we shared their famous Burrata appetizer, which tends to sell out every night. The Burrata consisted of fresh mozzarella topped with a balsamic glaze, black label prosciutto crudo and toasted bread. This app was extremely flavorful and fun to eat. I can see why it sells out almost every night. The mozzarella was really creamy and had an awesome sweet and tangy flavor because of the balsamic glaze. When you combine all the elements of this dish together you get this awesome little sandwich that is sweet, tangy and salty all at the same time.  

Cibo is known for their homemade wood fire pizza's that they prepare with only locally grown organic produce and imported Italian products. Every pizza on their menu sounded amazing so my fianc√© and I each ordered a different one so we could share them. These are the pizza's we got: 

Diavola- Tomato sauce, mozzarella, spicy salami, and Italian sausage 
Tartufata- Mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, white mushrooms and truffle oil. I also added Italian sausage and ricotta cheese.  

Both of these pizzas were phenomenal. They were both huge and cooked perfectly so the crust was thin and crispy, with slightly burnt edges. The spicy salami on the Diavola was actually really, really spicy. The tomato sauce on this pie was extremely flavorful too. The Tartufata  was really cheesy since it contained both mozzarella and ricotta cheese. The truffle oil and the white mushrooms that were on this pizza gave it such an amazing taste. 

The service at Cibo was top notch. Our waitress was really friendly and attentive. Since we had never been there before she was very helpful in explaining their menu and giving us suggestions on what we should try and what some of their most popular dishes are. She also always made sure our drinks were always full and that we had everything we needed. 
The prices at Cibo were good too. Their pizzas range anywhere from $12 to $15 dollars a piece, which is great considering how big and delicious they were. 

Whether you live in Phoenix or just visiting like I was, if you're looking for a romantic place to take you significant other then look no further than Cibo."}
{"text":"I am in awe of how fucking awesome this pizza was.  Especially in Phoenix, pretty much the last place I would ever think to find pizza this good because 99% of west coast pizza is dog shit.  I would put the Diavlo up against any of the numerous pies I've had in NYC, Rome, Florence, and Sicily.  Insane to read, right?  Well let me tell you those are words I never thought I'd write.  I am in fucking awe . . ."}
{"text":"Reading some of the other reviews you would think I visited another restaurant! I really like Cibo. I have been a few times now and it has only gotten better and better.

I love their take on appetizers, offering a choice of small bowls that don't just stick me with one option. (If you haven't had the arancini you haven't lived - risotto and pea in a lightly fried ball made of dreams and unicorn tears or something...)

Their pizzas are really tasty. My wife had the pear pizza and it was very savory, I had the boar bacon and it was delicious. I also love the thought they put into making the pizzas. I sat at the pizza bar once and noticed a lot of the little touches, like putting a spoon under the pizza and letting it sit for a few moments after it comes out of the oven - helps keep the crust crisp while the pizza cools. Smart!

I'm not a big pasta eater, but was ordered to have a bite of gnocchi by my sister and it was really tasty.

If you like desserts, basically try them all. The fritellas are something akin to a gourmet mini-doughnut and it comes with a variety of sauces. The pannacotta is 100% creamy and awesome. Don't even get me started on the cannoli.. Order 2. Don't ask questions, I am doing your a favor here (trust me).

Honesty one of the places where after you've had dessert once, it is impossible to avoid dessert every time you go.

I assume I will be judged as a horrible fan-boy if I don't post something constructive: I did notice that service could be a little in-attentive at times, examples include refilling my crostini when I needed more, or just general turn-around when ordering something small like a coffee.

With that said, they just opened, the servers were still super nice and my powers of observation told me that it wasn't in any way intentional. It also didn't diminish the taste of their most excellent food.

I hope they keep this up, as I'd like this to be a good spot for me to continue to haunt."}
{"text":"It's been hard for me to write this review. It's my favorite pizza in the universe, so I feel I need to express that with a huge review, but all I can come up with is, that it is simply the best, and you should see for yourself. And the olive oil, oh, the glorious olive oil the have here. I can drink it as a cocktail. The salads are good portion and the patio is fantastic. Never an off night yet. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Cibo is our favorite! The setting is elegant, yet casual enough for one to feel right at home. The quality of the ingredients makes the thought of eating pizza anywhere else unappealing. Whether you choose to sit inside or on the patio, you are in for a relaxing evening. I haven't been for lunch yet, although I plan on going this week. 

The price is what makes Cibo truly exceptional! My wife and I are completely satisfied sharing one $13 pizza, although we recommend going with friends to expand the variety."}
{"text":"All I have to say is awesome. Our waitress was friendly, the food was great and the atmosphere was perfect. Downtown Phoenix has the best little places to eat at!"}
{"text":"I thought I would try this place after several failed attempts to find good pizza in Arizona.  I ordered the Margherita pizza and the nutella/banana crepe.  The service was good. The pizza was the perfect true italian pizza. There were a few more burnt areas then I would have liked, but it wasn't a deal breaker. The dessert was great! Definitely a must have!"}
{"text":"I had the best gluten free pizza I ever had!!! and what fast service. no one else comes even close to taste."}
{"text":"I look forward to work trips that take us to Phoenix and Cibo is the one restaurant that we never miss.  The restaurant feels like home, the wait staff is generous but most importantly the quality of the food is amazing!  We were there last Friday for dinner and ate on the patio with our daughter (Very family friendly!!).  The weather was perfect.  We started out with the Burrata, then amazing pizza as the main course.  Compliments to the chef!  Can't wait to come back to Cibo!"}
{"text":"This is another lunch pick up I tried. House-like eatery on the corner with outside seats to meet up with friends. Walked in in late afternoon. Not many people in there eating. 
Saltimbocca are sandwiches. They don't serve pizza for lunch but somehow are known for pizzas. Their saltimbocca descriptions totally sound like pizza descriptions. Lol when we picked up our food we were expecting pizza boxes. They were sandwich boxes! What a let down!  We hoped that the saltimbocca will be deliciousoso!! 

Shared half of the hot Vegetariano (grilled red bell pepper, eggplant, zucchini and mozzarella) and the  porcellino (pulled BBQ pork and mozzarella). I enjoyed the vegetariano because it was all veggies and much lighter than the porcellino - which was siting on the heavy side. Also comes with a side of house salad of greens, pine nuts, red onion and shavings of cold cheese. 

I guess I'll have to try the pizza another time....for dinner. :)"}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed when I come here for food or just drinks. It's a great and very lively atmosphere, no matter what time of day or night you arrive. It's always busy.

I try, at every restaurant to try something new and different, but with this place I have my \"go to\". I always order the Gnocchi for dinner and Tiramisu for dessert. Yes, boring to some but they do such a great job with both. Especially with the Gnocchi. So good - wish it was a bit bigger.

Parking is tough at this location and if you find some on 17th Avenue, consider yourself lucky. I always park a bit away at the impark since it's never full any of the times I have been.

They have some great happy hour specials during the week and it starts at 3 - 6pm if you are looking to have a bevie or two.

Been to Cibo many times and will continue to do so! Maybe I will try something different next time ;)"}
{"text":"I went to Cibo with a friend, shortly after they opened, based on a review I'd read in an online blog. I had mixed emotions. I wanted to love the place. I enjoyed it, and  I will definitely be giving it a second chance. I had the Seafood Risotto. I found it a little on the bland side, but did very much enjoy the texture of the risotto, and found the seafood cooked very well. My friend had spaghetti and did not like the sauce. I tasted it, though, and found it to be wonderful. Just as we were about to head out, the electricity on the block went out, so we ended up staying a little longer than we'd planned. The staff handled this with a great deal of grace. They made sure that all the tables had enough to drink and made small talk with us while waiting for the electric to come back on. 

The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. While most places balk when someone asks for the ingredients in  certain things, they were more than willing to check on things for me, which is a nice change of pace from most places who give you attitude. Our waiter was very skilled. Not too over-bearing, but not negligent to a point that we had to ask for him. Overall, I'd say given a few months, Cibo will have all the bugs worked out."}
{"text":"Better than the best pizza in phx ; might have to wait a while ..."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere, and good location.  It is very comfortable place to be.  Has quick service, and is full of variety.

I'll honestly have the say the food is good, but its not for everyone.  I tried several kinds, and only 1 or 2 I enjoyed, but I was not very thrilled about any of it.  I will say the sausage is good."}
{"text":"I wish there was one in LA!! I went to AZ to visit a friend and I fell in love with this place! I kept on wanting to go back everyday but my friend was being a cheapie because it's not the cleverest thing to eat out all the time. Regardless, I really enjoyed my time there. The staff was great. I loved my dishes and especially the burrata appetizer. It was amazing. I got a pizza and added prosciutto.  Excellent in everything. We finished with a shot of lemoncello (I don't know how to spell it) but its vodka infused with lemon and it was amazing but hella strong. I want a Cibo in LA!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to update this since my last update. After posting my last update, I received a bit of a nasty email from someone affiliated with the restaurant, scolding me for not notifying them of the burnt pizza and saying they *probably* would have given a free dessert if I had (\"probably\"?! Wth?). So, whoever you are who wrote to me - first of all, it's not my job to do YOUR job. There were enough people involved in the making of my burnt pizza that it should have been noticed before making it to me. Second off, the waiter initially forgot to put the pizza order in, so he had to come back and ask me what I had ordered. So I wasn't too keen on complaining considering it was difficult to get the d*mn pizza to begin with. Thirdly, my toddler was eating it and I certainly would not have ever considered taking it away from her. Anyone who has ever eaten with toddlers would know this. Which leads me to my last point. Eating with a toddler at a restaurant is not easy to do. The last thing I would ever do is make the experience longer than I needed it to be. WTF. 

So, thanks for your nasty email. And here's some advice to you: the next time you receive a less than stellar review from someone whose hard-earned money pays your salary, respond like this: \"Dear customer, we are so sorry your experience was below our standards. Please see the manager the next time you visit so we can take care of you.\"

If I had received an email like that, you better believe I would have been back just for the customer service. As it is, I will never spend another dime there."}
{"text":"First things first.  A \"pizzeria\" should serve pizza all the time, including lunch, not just for dinner.  Where I'm from a \"pizzeria\" offers you pizza by the slice.

That being said I did enjoy some of the aspects of my dinner at Cibo.  The atmosphere and the service were fantastic.  The antipasto appetizer was great and puts the antipasto at Caffe Boa to shame.  (Although I did find the mozzarella in the antipasto to be rather flavorless which is bad because its my favorite type of cheese) The nutella crepe with bananas was heavenly, but then again anything with nutella is.

However, there are some pretty major drawbacks here for me.  The wine I had was pretty awful, which could have been my own fault.  I swear it was Franzia, or else came out of a box. Then there is the pizza.  We ordered the vegetarian pizza minus the mushrooms and were slightly shocked to discover when it came out that the toppings were spread individually on the slices.  So you have two slices with a single slice of roast zucchini, two slices with a single piece of artichoke, and two slices with a meager portion of red peppers.  For $11 for a 12\" pizza, it should be covered with toppings. I have never in my life seen a pizza constructed in such a fashion.  I like my toppings to be mixed together so you get all the flavors coming together at once on every slice.  With the size of the antipasto I was surprised to see that there were so little toppings on the pizza itself. We also ordered a calzone which was constructed in a similar fashion- a lot of meat on one side and cheese on the other.  And I have to say that there was a lot more dough than I would have liked there to be with the calzone.  

I would be willing to go back to try some of their lunch sandwiches but as far as pizza goes its not going to work out between us.

Update:  I suggested Cibo to a friend over the weekend....only to find out they don't serve lunch on Saturday?  What?  If its so \"urban\" they should be serving lunch on the weekends!!!

Update:  I recently went to Cibo for lunch with Melissa H.  I have to say that I was completely underwhelmed by my sandwich.  The prosciutto was flavorless.  The mozzarella was almost non existent.  The tomato slice was huge.  I basically had a pressed tomato sandwich.  I didn't think it was possible for a sandwich to lack flavor that way but apparently it is.  

People need to start eating better sandwiches if you think these are great.  They are mediocre at best.  

Meh.  I'm so not impressed with this place. I'm sitting betwee a 2 and 3 right now but I'll give them the 3 since the service is always friendly and they have Miss Vicky's chips."}
{"text":"Coming here on Valentines day the restaurant was packed and we got a place at the pizza bakery counter having a great look into the kitchen.

Well, where to start: the pizza was good after we finally got it. Lets go back to the beginning.

We, a group of two, arrived at 5pm and ordered our drinks and a pizza each. Sitting at the pizza counter we saw at least 6 people responsible to bake pizza: starting from the guy who prepared the pizza dough, 2-3 people preparing the pizza, 1 person restocking the supplies, 1 person responsible for the oven and one who took care of the pizza after it came out of the oven preparing it for the servers.

Wow - I remembered a saying: Too many cooks spoil the broth. 

And this was definitely the case here. I have never seen so much wastage of pizza because the dough was ripping, the pizza was burned, the order was mis-read or the guy baking it just ripped it in the oven. The guys were constantly switching positions and lost track about the orders. There was no visible 'chef' organizing the line.

Our order of two pizza arrived around one hour after we sat down.

For us it looked like it would have worked way better with half the staff only but clear tasks for everyone involved. But it looked they simply hired more staff and tried to win with quantity instead of quality.

Once again - the pizza at the end was good, but imaging how good it would have been 30 minutes earlier at my table with less waste and better efficiency ... this would also mean better profit for the owner and/or lower prices for the customer!"}
{"text":"Excellent server.
Place is nice and relaxed, great outdoor seating area.
Pizza was good. Wine selection was crappy.
Staff and owner were very nice.
Would go here over Bianca any time."}
{"text":"THE best pizza.  Anywhere.  Ever.  Period.  My wife and I come here frequently.  We love the Ostia salad.  Save room for dessert"}
{"text":"Lunch at Cibo today. I was looking for a good pizza and Cibo came up under the top pizzas in Phx. It's been a few years since I was there and that was only to stop by for a drink. Wow, they seem to have expanded. Very nice atmosphere. Nice place to eat outside. It really wasn't pizza... More like a pocket pizza or almost a calzone. Regardless, they have a nice menu variety, reasonable wines, and the desserts look terrific (did not try). This place may move up to 5 stars after my next visit. The fact that I say \"next visit\" should tell you something. We really liked this place. Parking is in the street with high curbs. Watch for door scrapes unless you are driving a truck or an SUV."}
{"text":"I checked out Cibo after reading the reviews on Yelp.

The wait wasn't too bad for a Saturday night. To kill the time, we went next door to Local Breeze and had a few drinks (I want to check that place out next).

After about a 30 minute wait, we got seated at Cibo. The place feels \"cozy.\" As previous posts have pointed out, the restaurant is built into an old house. It's got a nice atmosphere. You can go with friend or take a date.

My group all ordered a pizza (Margherita, Prosciutto Crudo, and Salmone). No one had any complaints. Everyone liked the crust and the fresh ingredients. I'm not a big fan of ham, but the prosciutto was fantastic!

For dessert, we ordered the Nutella and Mascarpone. It was refreshing (on the day we went, it happened to be 115 degrees -- gotta love summer in Phoenix).

I'm glad I went, I'd go again, and I'd recommend the place to a friend."}
{"text":"Took my mom here for Mother's Day.  Absolutely lovely experience.
The night time patio ambiance with greenery in a home setting with candle like light.  Pizza was a creative mix of artistic design and flavor.  My personal favorite was the dessert though.  Crepes with Nutella and chocolate or berries will end the night on a perfect note."}
{"text":"Our pizza spot since 2007 ! My husband only eat salads from here and the pesto is his fav and the denote is the choice for my husband and 5 yrs old son he called spice pizza !!! Crepes ice tea everything is so good like always"}
{"text":"My husband and I almost didn't try Cibo after reading several of the reviews that rated it poor to mediocre, but decided to take a chance because it's so close to where we live. I'm really glad we did, because I thought the food was very good.

While we waited for our appetizer, we had delicious warm whole grain Italian bread, with olive oil infused with garlic and a small strip of sun-dried tomato.

We started with the stuffed dates, which was the one thing we ordered that was just okay. The dates were stuffed with ground beef and wrapped in bacon -- a bit of meat overkill, I think, and the ground beef stuffing was nondescript; I prefer the manchego cheese stuffing I've had elsewhere. Also, the bacon could have been crisper.

My husband had cream of mushroom soup, which was rich but not too heavy, with great mushroom flavor. I had a sausage and white bean bean soup, in a tomato base with some kind of leafy greens and maybe some fennel. The waiter had told me that the soup contained salmon stock, but it didn't have a strong fish flavor; the stock just gave it that \"I don't know why this is so delicious, but it is\" effect. (I think umami is the technical term.)

My husband had the entr√©e special: beef tenderloin and brussels sprouts saut√©ed with bacon, served over linguine with mushrooms. It was delicious. I often like to make a meal of multiple appetizers, so I ordered a roasted pepper dish, and beans and greens. The pepper dish had banana peppers and red peppers, topped with melted parmesan and accompanied by grilled garlic-rubbed ciabatta. It was a wonderful combination. The only drawback was that the peppers arrived swimming in olive oil. It wasn't difficult scoop the food out of it, but it was a bit unpleasant to see. The beans and greens dish was delicious, but the proportion of beans to greens was the reverse of what I expected: it mostly white beans, with a small amount of greens mixed in. It was topped with bacon, and the flavor combination was excellent. I would have preferred more greens and fewer beans, though!

For dessert, my husband had pumpkin cannoli, and he liked it (I'm not a fan of cannoli). I had chocolate cheesecake with salted caramel sauce, which was to die for.

Service was a little uneven. When we first arrived, the host said we were lucky to get a table without a reservation due to a no-show, which was true, but not the most welcoming way to start things off. Our waiter was very nice, though, but service was slow, and even though we enjoyed our meal very much, we were a bit impatient at the end when it took a long time to get the check taken care of.

The space is small, so reservations are a good idea. Like most small restaurants, it gets very loud when it fills up, in spite of the carpeted floor and what appeared to be wall hangings designed to deaden noise a bit. I dream of finding a nice quiet restaurant, but it seems the only way to achieve that is to go at off hours.

Overall, I think Cibo is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"This place is always amazing, every time I go.  The burrata is to die for and I order it as soon as I sit down.  If you don't get there semi early though, they typically run out by 6 or 7 on Fridays and Saturdays.  All of the pizzas I've had are super tasty, with local ingredients for toppings.  My favorite has to be the Diavolo with ricotta.  The salami has a nice spicy kick and the ricotta balances it out nicely.  Its a little warm during the summer, as most of the seating is outside.  But once the sun goes down and they turn on the decorative lighting, you forget you're in downtown Phoenix.  I'd recommend this place over Pizzeria Bianco anytime.  Half the wait and twice as good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on a Friday evening. We had about a 30 min. wait which we spent in the bar w/ a good glass of wine. 
We were seated and promptly greeted by our waitress. She was friendly and quick. 
We split 2 pizzas, had a bottle of wine, and the Nutella Crepes. Everything was delicious!! 
At the end when we received our check, we were pleasantly surprised at how affordable the meal was. 
From start to finish, we loved this restaurant! The ambiance, food, and service were impeccable. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is definitely our favorite Pizza place in town! Absolutely AMAZING! This is my wife's go to spot for our once a month \"cheat\" day and let me tell you we totally take advantage. The Margarita pizza with added ground sausage is simply ogasmic. My only complaint would be their restrooms, however, if they were to paint their filthy doors and put a little bit more TLC in them I would give it an A+. My father and I own three successful businesses in the valley and he won't go back there because of the restrooms. What a shame cause that pizza is \"BOMB\"!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Everything was so fresh and service was great. We got the burrta and nutella with strawberrys you have to try!"}
{"text":"My favorite Phoenix lunch spot. Food is served quickly, always consistent and fantastic. Always. I think the staff are wonderful and friendly, their iced tea is so delicious. Being vegan, I either get the cous cous salad or the vegtariano without cheese. That sandwich is sooo good, and if you happen to save half for later, it tastes great afterwards too. 

I love love love Cibo. Best patio, delicious food, friendly staff. Best of Phoenix for sure."}
{"text":"Some of the best GF pizza I've had in PHX! Would definitely recommend this place. Cannot wait to come back to sit on the patio once it cools down  *misting system is on point*. Upon entering, we were immediately greeted and sat at a table, service was prompt, and friendly. Unfortunately,  our waitress seemed to not be in a great mood, she was short in response,  and maybe seemed to be in a bad mood or having a bad day. Either way,  this will only encourage me more to come back, try more food, enjoy the patio. I give the food 5 stars, but the service could have been a little more friendlier."}
{"text":"Great little place for lunch with friendly staff and lots of homemade goodies.  They've got these awesome sandwiches in homemade bread, kind of like fancy hot pockets or empanadas, but a bit bigger with nice ingredients like homemade meatballs.  They also have a really cute bunch of waitresses...:P.

It was a bit loud, but more lively than disruptive...they also have espresso and a variety of sweet crepes with Nutela  for desert, which is really cool.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place, great service amazing food. Beautiful ambiance, love the deserts! I always get the pizza with the truffle oil, yummy!! I also like that when I walk in and leave that I feel welcomed and appreciated as a customer."}
{"text":"Sigh. This place just isn't as good as I remember it from a couple years ago. I don't know if the quality has gone downhill or my tastes have changed, but it just wasn't the experience I was hoping for. 

During my recent visit, I split the pesto salad and funghi pizza with my cousin. The bread brought out was ok, crusty but a little too chewy and cold. I appreciate having oil on the table to dip. The salad was good. I absolutely loved the roasted potatoes on top. Way better than traditional croutons. The dressing was ok; I thought it could use more of a garlic kick.

Overall, the pizza was just good. I remember it being excellent. The sauce was bad. Bland and a bit too bitter. Good quality cheese. Again, I needed more of a \"kick\" from the toppings. No strong earthy flavors from the mushrooms. Crust was by far the best part.

Service was slow and inattentive but friendly. Value was good since we only spent $22 for our items. I was very full the rest of the night and even had leftover pizza for my husband to sample.

If anyone wanted to go to Cibo before an event downtown, I wouldn't argue, but I certainly wouldn't drive into Phoenix just for the food."}
{"text":"Well the only reason I come to CIBO is when there is happy hour...$5 pizza and $4 wine/beer. It's such a steal of a deal! Talk about a robbery lol. My only complaint is they had no siracha. Like what is Tabasco? Lol. But other than that...great patio, pizza and service ! Lol!"}
{"text":"So I went here for my first time, on a date. It was in the evening, dark. They had candles and torches lit. Very nice ambiance. We sat outside because it was cool. The pizza and wine was amazing. I'd definitely come back for a few drinks and food."}
{"text":"Great pizzas. Friendly staff. Nice atmosphere. Chicken, ribs, brisket, sausage, beans, fries and cole slaw are all great. Awesome place. love to come by soon."}
{"text":"Been here a few times in the last couple years. Always solid and never had a problem. Very cute date spot, actually the bf took me here on our first date, big points! I recommend the capricciosa(sp?) pizza and a nutella crepe with strawberries.

Parking is off the street and there will probably a wait, but it will be worth it"}
{"text":"We had high expectations given the 800+ reviews and near 5 star rating.

Reality was that it just wasn't that great. They also let kids run all around outside (where we were sitting), bumping into our chairs and being really obnoxious.

There was some great live music and the ambiance attempt was pretty great. 

The pizza also was burnt. I love brick oven pizza. It's just that it's not supposed to be burnt. There is an art to it.

I'd maybe try it again, but after trying some of the other places in the area.

Service was super, super slow.  We waited for our check for like 25 minutes while our server ignored us and attended to a larger party instead. She also wasn't too attentive with drinks, etc."}
{"text":"Very quaint and romantic pizzeria located in Downtown Phoenix. Has a very urban and rustic feel with the brick, vines, and tree lightings. Request to eat outside in the evening when it is much cooler as you enjoy the sunset and live music playing in the background.

We started off with the pesto salad, which was amazing. I'm a major carnivore and prefer having meat, but this salad was quite satiating even without. 

For pizzas, we had the Procida (mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, Asian pears, chopped arugula, goat cheese and black pepper) and Salsiccia (tomato sauce, sausage and mozzarella). Pizzas crust were thick for \"thin\" crust pizza. I enjoyed the Procida most, since I love goat cheese, but would probably opt out of the pears next time. I usually prefer a very crunchy crust, but it's a bit soft here. 

My verdict? My favorite pizzeria is still Grimaldi's in Peoria, but in terms of ambience, this is definitely a very cute place for a date or even an evening out with friends, so I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't even have to give them a star. I'm not one to complain, I love to see the success of new business' and restaurants and really wish(ed) them the best. So naturally with Cibo being a new restaurant I wanted to check it out and see what everyone was raving about.

When walking in to the establishment it was very nice, clean, very rustic looking with a very nice lay out. We were seated upstairs which was very loft like and urban . Like mentioned the staff are underdressed and blend in with patrons dining. No way to really tell who works there and who doesn't. 

We Sat down and weren't served anything to drink for about 10-15 mins, didn't know who our server was up until that point and when served were greeted with a waitress who was less than charismatic, treated us more like her friend than paying guests, throwing out her friends names of dishes (unpronounceable to most who don't speak Italian) like \"The Fag\" (I'm not kidding) short for whatever the dish she was referring to was called. Meanwhile before we've even ordered, Food runners are asking us if \"This\" is what we ordered - they have no clue what table was what and walked around aimlessly with food in their hand until directed by the server to point them to the table. This continued even throughout our meal. After a being open a few weeks how is this happening?

We ordered a few starters which came and were quite good - maybe not to die for but palatable at the very least. Up next was our main course. I ordered a Pasta dish that had broccolini, sausage, tons of garlic and even more olive oil than you could imagine. First few bites were very good! As I continued through the plate I put a big leaf like thing into my mouth- thinking how out of place and odd it was to have a mix of broccolini and leafy  vegetable in the pasta but didn't think too much of it. After putting it into my mouth I immediately spat it out, obviously this wasn't meant to be in the dish - maybe some sort of Garnish?? No idea. Put it the the side of my plate briefly and realized that again something wasn't right. Picked it up and saw that there was a date on it. Turns out it was a 4\" piece of green painters tape with a \"best before\" date that obviously the kitchen uses to date their food. I informed the waitress of the issue and before I could tell her not to bring me another dish the plate was gone and so was she.

When she came back with the new dish she says \"You know, I thought the dish looked extra green, but thought they'd just added more broccolini, they're always changing things up on me so never second guessed it! You know, we usually keep an eye out for things like hairs and stuff\" (yet a giant piece of painters tape went unnoticed? Is Ashton Kutcher going to jump out and tell me I'm being punked? Am I on some \"What Would You Do\" Dateline show and John Quinones is going to come out with a camera crew?? Nope, this is happening). No apology, instead just laughed off as if that slip up wasn't a big deal.  She left, came back to check how my (untouched) second meal was and added \"no tape I hope!\" Where in the world is the professionalism? Making light of something so disgusting is inexcusable. When I told her I couldn't eat it I was then asked if I'd like it to go, I declined. We weren't seated far from the POS station where they ring in Orders when I over heard our waitress request that the manager Comp a dish - his first response was \"WHY?\" in anger/disgust. When she explained the situation, he replied with an \"oh, ok\"

Since this was brought to a managers attention I'd expect someone to apologize, take ownership for something like this happening! He passed by the table several times (probably didn't know which table he comped was, the food runners didn't so I wouldn't be surprised) and nothing.

We were given our bill (which I'm surprised we given) but We left money on the table and decided to get out and go somewhere else where the service would be better for evening drinks. As we walked out of the building and walked maybe 8 feet from the entrance our waitress came barreling out the doors shouting down 17 Avenue with many bystanders nearby \"Ladies, you didn't pay the full amount of your tab!!!\" Not only did we pay, we also left a good tip when she realized she had more than the bill we got no apology , just a \"oh my bad, I'm such a moron\" Stuck out her hand and said \"slap me\"  Slap your hand? 

Later I posted about how I was bummed out by the experience. TODAY I got a message from the manager (same guy from last night) asking ME to CALL him. Couldn't handle it in person? When I asked for HIS boss' info I was ignored and told \"I take full responsibility, and would 'appreciate' it if you dealt with me\" Too little too late. Only time I'll go back is when its a new restaurant w/ experienced Staff.

Supremely disappointed in staff and lack of ownership/responsibility when I was present. Now I'm gone he wants to jump through hoops? Give me a Break!"}
{"text":"So good! Favorite place to eat downtown. Amazing service. Never tried something there that I haven't loved."}
{"text":"Very trendy place! Great vibes, servers are all very fun and friendly. Place is very modern yet rustic. The applies, pizza and dolces are amazing!!!!! A bit noisy but overall a fun place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"This place was alright. I took my bf here for a surprise dinner for his birthday. When I called I asked if they do anything special for birthdays and they said they could bring out a dessert for him. I also asked if we could reserve a table outside, and they said no problem. 

I called an hour before our reservation and was told everything was good to go. When we arrived, the waiter almost said \"everyone is seated back here\" and I kind of had to shush him, being that it was a big surprise for my bf... So he walked us to our table, which was inside even though we reserved an outside table. 

Everything went well, the food was okay but no dessert was ever brought out. I wasn't too impressed with my first visit but I think I'd return for a casual dinner date or something."}
{"text":"Great food, we had a party of 10, 4 small children. The food was awesome,  the staff pleasant and the atmosphere was nice!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best! So great, my husband actually proposed to me here. The quality of the ingredients are truly amazing, and you can't top the ambiance. This place holds a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance; however, I was not crazy about the service that was provided. 

Our server was really uninterested to be there, didn't seem like she cared at all. She has handed us two different manus and soft drinks were priced diferantley on both."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. Very good wood fired pizza here. Also some nice pasta selections.  Amazing place overall. It's small and accessible to everyone. I loved the atmosphere the most."}
{"text":"Charming court yard with amazing service. I am big fan for Italian food but mainly for its pasta (and have been pretty peculiar about it). I was quite underwhelmed by the fried calamari- $12 for some frozen rubber-like breaded calamari was really I had hoped for thus a four star. (What was I thinking when I order seafood in the middle of a desert?! I asked for it). The pasta was quite a meh that I could not finish it; thank goodness the pizza with anchovies was great! 

All in all, I would come back again as a no brainer, and will go ahead with their pizza and wine."}
{"text":"Out of town guest always love the patio and the charm of Cibo- not to mention the amazing food.  I haven't had a bad dish and we've tried everything from the pizzas to delicious homemade pastas. Cibo never disappoints."}
{"text":"I'm glad I found Cibo before they close for good next weekend. This is real, modern Italian. No, you won't find anything they have at Olive Garden! LOL
The decor is clean and sleek; there are only about a dozen white linen clad tables. 
I started with elk carpaccio, which was everything I hoped it would be. My friend had a wonderful beet and pear salad with ch√®vre and mixed greens.
My entree was a half order of amazing spaghetti and pork and beef meatballs. And there was so much, even in a half order, that I took some home. This sauce wasn't too tomatoey, it had a cheesy taste too and it clung to  the spaghetti perfectly. I'd order it again if they were going to be around. My friend ordered eggplant parmesan. There were two large slices nestled in fried portobello mushroom caps. Excellent.
I am usually not a dessert person, but we split a magical salted caramel caramel custard And practically fought for the last spoonful. 
Sorry I can't make this a regular dinner spot! 
Oh yes, and it's BYOB."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch as a quick downtown sit down spot.  The sandwiches are good and they come with a side of either salad, fruit salad or chips.  I always order one of three sandwiches (the prosciutto, the pulled pork or the pastrami)  All great, all with a salad, that has fresh sliced parmesan and pinenuts.  Already a winner in my book!  The dessert crepes are huge and need at least two people to work on it after an entree."}
{"text":"Cibo is the average person's answer to Pizzeria Bianco.  I've rarely had to wait over 10 minutes to get a table.  Patio seating is quaint, romantic and perfect for a private date or a larger group.

Cibo has mainly salads, pizzas, and desserts.  Try the margarita pizza for a taste of a pure italian wood fired pizza.  Each serves 1-2 people.

Local favorite."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in phoenix, hands down. If you don't get the pulled beef sandwich for lunch you are missing out on life. Oh and the crepes are too die for. Great service, nice people and darling restaurant."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix. I have tried Biancos several times and I keep coming back to Cibo!  Great food, wonderful ambience, super funky neighborhood, and good people watching. Love this place. Have been happily coming here for over 10 years and never had anything but a perfect experience."}
{"text":"Inga, our waitress, was really nice and attentive! Additionally, and most importantly, the food was exquisitely prepared. All the dishes came out piping hot. We ordered mussels for appetizer, there were many mussels in the dish and the sauce was delicious. My boyfriend order the duck, which was plentiful and tender. I got the spaghetti and meatballs, which i usually avoid at restaurants because its so simple....but at Cibo the dish was complexly flavored and absolutely delectable. I recommend getting the large plate of spaghetti because the meatballs are so good you will want to eat a million!! For dessert, i got the salted caramel custard--two thumbs up! Very rich :)

Cant wait to return!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza spot in Phoenix, hands down. You've gotta love the Italian craftsmanship that goes into each pie. Sausage, prosciutto and salmon are the house favorites and each pie comes with a generous drizzle of olive oil. The crust is chewy and fresh outta the oven, with delicious bubbles of char. 

The atmosphere is reason enough to come here. This place packs the crowds in every night for dinner in its charming turn-of-the-century downtown home. The owners are sweethearts, the wine flows consistently and it's a vibrant downtown must-do. Skip it on First Fridays, though... the crowds can get too intense."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. We had a big group on the patio and had a great time. The Patio is gorgeous!!"}
{"text":"Y'know, I had read all these mixed reviews, and heard all these mixed things about Cibo. But I'm the kind of girl who likes to check things out myself before judging.

So the other night, in search of a place that sells late-night tapas / appetizers , we drove past Cibo and found it to be open. 

We were seated near the window, unfortunately next to a table having a MASSIVE party. They were so incredibly loud, I thought I had to clamp my hands over my ears, but Chris pointed out that the entire restaurant was pretty loud. 

We ordered the 5 appetizer platter, and it was perfect for the two of us. We had the roasted eggplant dip, the black cod bacala, the shrimp, the arancini and the veal meatballs. It all came with crostini on the side. Everything was presented so pretty and professional, I was really impressed. The price for 5 appies was $18. Not bad at all. 

My favourites of the night was the arancini, with the veal meatballs being a close second. The arancini (risotto balls) sat on this light tomato sauce and was just the perfect little bite! 

None of the five items were heavy or greasy, so we really enjoyed that. 

Our waitress was a hyperactive ball of energy, which I think fits into the atmosphere Cibo was going for. 

Maybe its loud in Cibo, but they are going for a casual eatery vibe, and I really enjoyed it all at the end of the night. And the food was really tasty, so we will for sure come back to try a full meal!

Review #10 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"AMAZING. 

I've only been to Cibo for dinner, but it's one of the few restaurants that i've been to HUNDREDS of times. I cringe whenever I hear someone talking about going to pizzaria Bianco, bec Cibo's pizza is exponentially better and you won't face the hours of waiting that you'll run into at Bianco. 

Esp. recommend going to dinner here when it's a bit cooler... they have live music, a fire pit, and beautiful outdoor dining."}
{"text":"Not too shabby. Pizza and sandwiches are quite delicious, ambiance is pretty swank and the staff are very friendly. Valet parking makes eating here a breeze. Well done central phoenix entrepreneurs. well done indeed."}
{"text":"We love CIBO.  Food, wine, ambiance is terrific."}
{"text":"I don't know if I could be any more in love with a restaurant than I am with Cibo. Last night was the first time I have been there but I think this is going to start being a new go to. We started with the meatball appetizer, let me just say I would have licked the sauce from the bowl if it wasn't publicly frowned upon, and the meatballs were delicious. We also had the arancini balls-basically gooey balls of cheese and rice. They are very good as well but very filling-obviously. My husband then had the prosciutto pizza and I had the diavola, wish I would have taken pics as I usually do but I was too busy stuffing my face. Then we finished off with a crepe Suzette...filled with orange marmalade and topped with gran marnier and set on fire with ice cream. Needless to say we were so full we had to roll ourselves out the door. I could go on and on, but basically the restaurant is beautiful, the patio is amazing, will definitely need to sit out there when it cools off and the food is to die for."}
{"text":"Came by last night tried their crapes they were amazing one of the best I've ever had I would definitely come back and recommend all my family and friends."}
{"text":"Reason for visit: breakfast with my mentee

Service: friendly and accommodating 

Cool points: great patio, courtyard style dining with live music (soft for breakfast)

Food: so this is one of my more current visits, I want to say Feb. 9 to be exact (i checked the text stamp). We met right as they were opening so we got a great table. I ordered the hot (Contadino) sandwich which was scrambled egg, spinach and ricotta cheese with a glass of prosecco - my entree came with some fresh fruit. This was my third visit to Cibo (in the last three years), my first visit I had the crepes and the second I had the caprese salad. Everything has always been fresh and delicious, I probably should go more often but it is downtown and I have a couple regular spots a little closer to where I live. I would definitely recommend this place for a bubbly and fun lunch date  I have not had dinner here yet."}
{"text":"Always great atmosphere..sit on the patio or in tge eckectic rooms. Great pear and gorgonzola pizza, meatballs, pasta, great service"}
{"text":"Dinner was great half vegetarian and el noce pizza rosse. Good wine selection. Calamari was strips with a spicy sauce is a good starter. Love the ambiance and patio."}
{"text":"Great place for date night,  or just to enjoy delicious food with friends and family. On a nice night, enjoy dinner in their patio with live music by a local artist. They have a great selection of beer and wine, and their woodfire pizza is amazing."}
{"text":"Cibo is a great spot for pizza and ambiance.

Like many successful places, sometimes service takes a hit- when it gets busy at peak times. One weak link is a male server who consistently spaces out and gets orders wrong. I am a fan of people who don't need to write down the order, but then when you get multiple things wrong- it's not so bueno. Luckily the food is so good, it eclipses occasional sub-par service.

I recommend the Diavola pizza with anti-pasta to start. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Love this place!! It has a lovely, romantic, intimate atmosphere. The patio is beautiful (especially at night, with the twinkle lights on), but the inside of this old house is so charming as well!.

The food has always been outstanding! Hands-down one of my favorite pizza places. I recommend the Margherita pizza -- the simplicity allows the high quality ingredients to really shine through. The crepes are so delicious as well.

I gave it 4/5 stars because the service is a bit lacking. The servers aren't generally super friendly, though not quite unpleasant. It's one of the places where you feel almost like an inconvenience to them. Perhaps that's just me though.

At any rate, I will continue to return, because the food and ambiance are wonderful!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here today. Great atmosphere and decor. We live in Ohio and search the world over for great pizza. This is very good Neapolitan style pizza. We also had a sandwich and it was excellent. Great restaurant."}
{"text":"Not everything is good here, but they do have some incredible dishes at a reasonable price.

What I recommend: 
The Gnocchi for the entree and the Goat Cheese Panna Cotta for dessert.

The waitress messed up our order on the pizza, but the food did come out quite quickly. I still dream about that Panna Cotta."}
{"text":"Tony and wife provide a fabulous experience. On top of great pastas, pizzas and wine list, the service is fun and attentive on a relaxing outdoor lawn. And live tunes to boot. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing !!!!! 
So first impression, the outside seating area is perfect for cool Arizona nights. 
The food was really good and I would recommend the dinotte it was by far the best thing. The crepes were also good but I could live with out them. The ice tea was very delicious and the restrooms are clean. This place was great and the atmosphere was awesome"}
{"text":"Hands down without a doubt the best pizza I've ever had!! Blows away anything in Phoenix, not even close. I will come here as often as I can."}
{"text":"Best tasting pizza in Phoenix,  room was small, could not even hear waitress talk, but food was great"}
{"text":"There are a lot of cozy and charming little houses in Phoenix converted into a restaurant.  Cibo is one of them.  We went there for lunch and service was prompt and friendly.  Pomo Pizzeria (the VPN certified pizzeria in Scottsdale & Phoenix) used to be my number one pizza place, but Cibo has won me over!  You can taste the quality ingredients and everything is absolutely delicious!  

What we ordered:
Salmone Sandwich
Cold sandwich consisting of smoked salmon, cream cheese, sprouts, arugula, and capers. Served on an amazing saltimbocca bread that's baked fresh with every order in their wood burning oven!  Comes with delicious garden salad sprinkled with pine nuts.  Absolutely fabulous sandwich!  Healthy too!

Polpette Sandwich
Homemade meatballs in tomato sauce with melted mozzarella.  Served on an amazing saltimbocca bread that's baked fresh with every order in their wood burning oven! Perfect sandwich with oozing cheese!  Yum!

Diavola Pizza
Lunch size pizza with tomato sauce, mozzarella and spicy salame.  Very good!

Di Notte Pizza
Fontina, pecorino, gorgonzola, mozzarella and spicy salame.  Their crust is perfectly thin, chewy, and crispy.  Puffed up on the side like they should be, and absolute delight to eat!"}
{"text":"Cibo is a great place to go!!
They have a large patio and indoor seating as well. Cibo has great appetizers such as the burrata.. It is a fun place to go for a dinner date or lunch with the girls. The pizzas are good and the crepes are amazing. Service was good. Love this place!"}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars.  Cibo is a very charming and cozy house turned restaurant, and they offer plenty of seating with their large front patio as well as ample seating inside.  

My family and I decided on 2 salads and 4 pizzas to share.   All the pizzas were delightful but I wasn't really blown away.  The service was great except for the rude brunette hostess who barked at me when I mentioned we had a reservation.  It's ok though, I understand that Saturday nights can be stressful, but just keep your cool, lady."}
{"text":"Didn't eat the food but we called ahead to ask about their HH and were incredibly disappointed. NO SPIRITS in the building! Just beer and wine. They had a few house wines on HH, but I needed a stiff one. We went across to The Vig."}
{"text":"This place might be my favorite place to eat in the entire Phoenix area.  Not only are the sandwiches during lunch and pizzas at dinner spectacular, the whole experience is top notch.  The wait staff is great and the building is an old home with such a great ambiance to it that you cannot help but have a great time at this place.  Whether you are looking for a date place or a place to go with a bunch of friend and share great conversation, this place will work great for you."}
{"text":"Phoenix is lucky to have a spot like this to claim. Cibo is a house built about a hundred years ago near downtown Phoenix that was converted to a pizzeria. The inside is fairly small with dim lights and wood floors. The outside is a little bit bigger with lots of trees lit up with Christmas lights and filled with swamp coolers. The restaurant is both intimate and casual at the same time. It almost feels like you are in another city that people actually congregate together instead of stay spread out miles apart. 

The service is pretty good for how busy they can get. They only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. If you go on a Friday or Saturday night be prepared to wait anywhere from 30 minutes to over an hour. 

The price is fair to moderate depending on how much you want to taste. I recommend tasting as much as you can preferably with at least a group of 4. 

The food is really good. Two of the appetizers that are hits are the antipasto which comes with meat, olives, mozzarella, and roasted peppers spread out on a large plate. The other is the burrata, which comes with this awesome bread slightly burnt, two home made mozzarella balls with a soft center and balsamic vinegar drizzled on top, and some prosciutto on the side. Both are really great and enough to share for 4 or more. If you can only get one definitely go with the burrata. 

The pizza is what people really come here for but maybe a bit of a disappointment depending on what you are expecting. My favorite is the margherita with spicy salami added. The pizza is about a 12\" artisanal style. The toppings are good but honestly could be better. The sauce is a tasty but on the thick side. The dough is nicely charred but too chewy. Don't get me wrong, the pizza is delicious and blows away quite a few other options in AZ but it doesn't take the cake for me. 

For dessert Cibo offers a few different crepes with nutella and fruit that are popular. Tastes like crepes filled with chocolate and fruit. Tastes decent but nothing special. 

For two people with drinks, appetizer, pizza, and dessert you are looking right under a bill with tip. 

Here's how I round it out: 
Appetizer - 5 (burrata) 
Service - 4 
Price - 3.5 
Pizza - 3.5 
Dessert - 3 

Overall - 4"}
{"text":"Unimpressed, been there once when it first opened and havent been back since. I have to say, after having experienced real Italian pizza made by real italians in Argentina,  any pizza establishment will have the unfortunate task of rising up to certain taste levels. 

Not only is the menu limited, the place seems overcrowded and service convoluted. My pizza (if u can call it pizza) seemed like cardboard pizza and with not enough cheese or sauce. My friend had a calzone that he ate with disgust and disappointment."}
{"text":"4/10 - Updating this to 5 stars.  Went here again and I just love, love, love this place.  We ate inside this time because it was cold out, and the inside is just as great as the patio!  And once again, such great starters, pizzas, and desserts!  This time tried the braesola pizza (fan-fricking-tastic) and the fresca crepe (filled w/ vanilla ice cream - YUM).  Will keep going here again and again while I'm in town!

***********************
Once again, another solid place in Phoenix!  I know this is going to sound really disloyal to my city, but I think that SF could learn a thing or two from good old Phoenix in terms of casual but upscale restaurants..... This is in addition to the lack of good patio options in SF - which of course is abundant in Phoenix , in addition to space heaters that are turned on if the temp is anything lower than 70 degrees (yes, Arizonans consider this to be chilly - sounds ridic. to us SFers).  Anyway, my co-workers and I had a great meal here the other night on the beautiful front patio.  The starters (pear and pecorino salad, antipasto platter) and pizzas were all yummy!  My favorite was the Rustica - yummy prosciutto with arugula, but I also really liked the Diavolo(sp?), with salami, sharp tomato sauce, and just the right amount of cheese.  And the dessert crepes were fab!  We got the Nutella + mascarpone, and the Nutella with  bananas - both very good.  All in all a great meal!  All served outside in the balmy Phoenix evening, on a quaint patio.... I was loving it!!  I want to come back again, and save time for some drinks before dinner - there are also cute little nooks on the other side of the patio, with couches / chairs and even a firepit!"}
{"text":"Went with friends on a Sunday after seeing all the raving reviews for it. I loved the outdoor patio area, which was spacious yet intimate. We sat under a giant red umbrella which hid my Asian glow fairly well. For the record, their bellinis are awesome.

The Fritatta Melfitana I ordered was good. Maybe I had too high of an expectation or something but I didn't think it was that special. Perhaps their pizzas would blow my mind."}
{"text":"If Cibo was located in a large urban city like NY or SF, it would be lucky to get 2 stars. However, in Phoenix, this place gets a 3.5 stars for it's ambience. The restaurant is a very nice cozy mix of a pizzeria, a ski lodge and a patio bar.  It has a very unique and fun feel. It's also located in downtown Phoenix.  It has a very Northern California house type of feel. The wine selection was excellent and it was served chilled. The service was excellent and they were very laid back.  

However, the pizza was disappointing.  The crust was soggy and it could have been much crispier. It definitely did not taste baked and there was no substance to it. It felt you were just picking up slabs of cheese with sauce. The cheese was good but not great. It almost passed the authenitc test but it's still lacked the texture and flavor of authentic mozzarella. Normally, I wouldn't criticize cheese so intensely but this place is trying to compete with the likes of authentic \"Italy\" Italian pizza with the likes of pizzeria bianco yet it failed to measure up. Nonetheless, Pizzeria Bianco is incredibly hyped in my opinion too.

Still, I would recommend this place because it is fun and unique. And people should check it out. It's not a cookie cutter chain that Phoenix is known to have. Furthermore, you will get the same experience as Pizzeria Bianco without the hype and the 3 hour wait."}
{"text":"My BF is a sucker for good Italian food, and Phoenix has plenty of options. We ended up at Cibo when we didn't want to wait for Pizzeria Bianco. Cibo ended up being a cute spot for date night, located in a converted house complete with cozy nooks to get some privacy with your partner. 

Cibo speicalizes in Neapolitan style pizza, with blistered edges and a \"wetter\" middle. If you don't like that type of pizza, you might not enjoy your experience here. We shared an the meatball appetizer (three huge balls!) and a glass of wine, then split the Capricciosa pizza,  topped with proscuitto, mushrooms, artichokes, and olives, the dough miraculously remaining light despite the ton of toppings! Our meal was filling and reasonably priced ($40), but we opted for dessert elsewhere, as all of Cibo's options are sweet crepes."}
{"text":"Great dinner choice while in Phoenix. Their pizza was pretty good, kind of soggy in the middle, i prefer it to be a little more crispy but overall pretty good pie. Their burrata app with fresh mozzarella was awesome and their crepe filled with nutella and chocolate sauce was great too. Would definitely visit this place again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"The service is sometimes slow.... The atmosphere and service is a bit pretentious. Good wine and beer selection, but the food and pizza is overrated. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Sadly, I'm not impressed with Cibo other than the very pleasant, kid-friendly outdoor patio. It's been over six or seven years since I last dined here, and back then, I was never really impressed by the food, but, after like 100 people telling me over the years how awesome the pizza was, my family and decided to give it another try because I must be crazy if I'm the only one I know who did not love Cibo, right?? 

My opinion has not changed. The food was edible, some fresh-ish such as the mozzarella on the margarita pizza but it was not explosively so and frankly lacked any flavor at all (as compared to other fresh mozzarellas which can be incredibly delicious despite lacking much \"flavor\".... ) The prosciutto my four year old ordered as a side to his kids' pizza (hey, he's a foodie!) was sub par quality but he gobbled it! The sauces on the pizza and pasta were \"spaghetti'o\" tasting per my husband and I kind of agree. No fresh Parmesan... disappointing. 

And overall, while it's a kid friendly setting, my husband an I both felt like our server was merely tolerating the existence of our two kids who were at her table. She was pleasant enough and was in no way rude or sub-par as far as her duties, but really didn't seem to be into having kids in her section. I get it, we're a pain, we're messy, we know it ... but we tip well and would prefer to feel like we didn't have to leave asap. The busser at the end of the meal was super cool with our kids, engaging, friendly and happy, so sad I didn't get his name to thank him."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic great food friendly service kids loved it to. First visit here and next time we visit Calgary we will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend. The tuna sandwich was delicious and it was so much food for such a great price ($9 and I chose house salad for my side). I like the atmosphere, it's super cute and the staff was very kind."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing! The wait staff is prompt and friendly, although sometimes I feel like there are more waiters than customers, lol. I recommend sitting outside, any room inside is incredibly loud and you have to yell across the table to have a conversation. Great little spot, though, and the food is always worth it!"}
{"text":"After eating about the city for about a year and a half, I can't find a restaurant more divine than Cibo.  The setting is key.  Carved into an old house, Cibo offers a stellar patio from October to March where giant trees studded with lights and providing a seductive canopy create a romantic or intimate setting (depending on who you are dining with).  Inside small two or four seat tables nestled into every nook and cranny of the adorable former house provide the same feeling as the outside but with a few dashes of warmth and cozy.

Now comes the food.  I feel in love with prosciutto at Cibo.  I rediscovered why I loved pepperoni here.  I remember each time I come just how perfect pizza can be.  I have had about 7 different pizzas here.  The one with arugula on top is delicious.  The one with just cheese (4 delectable kinds) and spicy salami is delicious.  The one with walnuts is delicious.  I could go on and on.

Perfect for a date. Perfect for an out of towner.  Perfect for a birthday.  Perfect for any occasion."}
{"text":"Cibo - NOT GOOD!!

I heard all the hype about Cibo and how great their pizzas are, we I'm not sure what everyone's talking about because both pizzas lacked quality and taste.
 First off the crust is very hard and chewy, your jaw becomes sore after half a slice. Not sure what they put in their dough but this is way too tough (maybe need a little more yeast?)  It's almost like eating a cold hard sourdough with tomato sauce on it. 
The toppings were non existent, a few little sprinkles of sausage, and pepperoni that's it!  The sauce bland, and the cheese just okay, We ordered the meat combo, I don't mind paying for good quality, but for this small little pizza, and for the little amount of topping this was unacceptable.
 I have been to good quality \"wood fired\" pizzerias and they were loaded with toppings and full of flavor and wonderful sauce and cheeses. Cibo pizza lacked in all areas, I will not come here again - the ambiance was quaint and nice however the pizza and salads and the rest of the fare is unacceptable.  

1 Star for the ambiance 
1 Star for the pizza

I will not be back...unless I am going for drinks.."}
{"text":"I think my mouth died and went to heaven.

Incredibly fresh ingredients.
Hot and crispy thin crust.

Now My favorite pizza place EVER.

Pizza Bianco and Parlor are my next destinations- and they have some tough shoes to fill."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix! Everyone says pizzeria bianco is the best but it's nothing compared to cibo! I love the setting and the pizza is phenomenal! The menu is unique and I have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is an old 1913 bungalow in downtown Phoenix and has a great patio. I can't say enough about this place, the food is amazing and so is the service.    The fresh burrata is so light and creamy, the fresh savory zeppole OMG, lets just say I could just eat those and burrata and be happy.  The homemade pasta and pizza are very tasty with great sauces and toppings.  

Make sure you are prepared for on street metered parking or using the complimentary valet as long as its not full."}
{"text":"I think the menu selection here is brilliant and creative. Everything sounds delicious and I always have a hard time choosing .. however, I don't think the quality of ingredients is as high as it should be. I have eaten here several times and during pizza week last year, and I felt sick with dietary issues after each meal. High quality appeal, decent tasting food, low vibing quality of ingredients."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza place I have tried thus far in Phoenix. I love that it is located in a house. I couldn't decide between two of the pizzas and they let you do half and half! That really got me excited. I had the truffle pizza and another white one with spicy sausage. They both were amazing! I will be back shortly. Great place to take out of town guests."}
{"text":"I can safely say that after trying pizzeria Bianco 3 times now, Cibo is Way better in my opinion. Flavors are on point and pizza cooked to perfection where you don't feel like the bottom of your pizza tasted bitter and burned in a wood fired oven (unless that's what you're looking for then I would eat somewhere else). Love their outdoor patio space!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot away from Downtown Phoenix.  I love their salads!"}
{"text":"What a great meal - delicious, great service, and an amazing value!

I came during happy hour (ends at 6PM) where they had house wine for $4/glass and many affordable appetizers. The happy hour menu is also really cute - the original is hand drawn and quite colorful.

I started with the Arancini appetizer ($4/4 arancini) - Arancini are rice balls stuffed with some mozzarella and then deep fried. When it got brought out I was surprised by how large they were, they were each about 2 inches in diameter! The mozzarella was nice and gooey on the inside and the marinara sauce completes it.

Gnocchi alla Sorrentina ($6) - the gnocchi could have been slightly fluffier but overall the flavor was good. The basil and the tomato sauce were nicely balanced. There was a decent amount of cheese which melted and made the dish an interesting mix of textures of flavors.

Linguine Puttanesca ($16) - You can order their hand made pasta starting from 5PM. It was highly recommended by the waitress so I decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed! The pasta was perfectly al dente, it had just enough of a bite. The black olives are not your usual olives, they were the perfect complement to a mouthful of handmade pasta. The fresh ground black pepper and large grain salt also helps to elevate the flavor."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Sunday. No line, no wait, fast service. This review is based on my first visit to Cibo. The ambiance is great. Very cozy indoors and garden dining outside. Best part of the visit was the atmosphere. Cheese and basil pizza came out to the table quick. I found lacking in flavor. No pepper, garlic, olive oil, or herbs in the sauce. Yet with the complete absence of seasoning, it was packed with salt. Also had the frittata which was had a nice texture and eggs were cooked perfectly. However, again, lacked seasoning.  I asked for ketchup and tabasco and mixed it together for a spicy ketchup that saved the dish. I was disappointed they didn't have a homemade ketchup or other homemade sauce for the eggs and potatoes. I would go back on a nice day because this is a charming corner garden in which to sit outside with an iced tea and sandwich."}
{"text":"Oh my lord. This is it. The end all be all of Phoenix pizza. I loved everything we ordered and had no problems devouring it.

We started with the calamari which was perfectly cripy and had the perfect amount of salt and bright lemon. 

The funghi pizza with red sauce was to die for. The ultra thing crust is dangerously easy to chow down on. The white pizza with truffle oil was great too, but I'm personally not into truffle anything. 

The ambiance is adorable and unique - a converted house to give a very homey and warm feeling. This is definitely on the short list of perfect date spots."}
{"text":"After my first bizarre experience, I was a little reluctant to return. However, Karen graciously invited us back to make up for it, a gesture I really appreciate. Things were much different this time around. The food was wonderful and the atmosphere was lovely. We had the buratta, two soft scoops of mozzarella with proscuitto and bread. Yum! I guess it's not always on the menu so get it if you can. We also had the di note pizza and the nutella and mascarpone crepe. Everything was perfect and made with care. Thank you, mike and Karen for taking such good care of your customers! I will definitely be back. 

I've been sneaking bites of my leftovers and they are still just as delicious! I'll be thinking about the buratta until the next time I get to eat it."}
{"text":"Fruit crepes and peach belinis on a sunny patio, while the guitar is strummed lightly in the corner. Awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a perfect romantic date/ first date/family event spot.  The restaurant is adorable, the food is delicious, and the service is great.  If you order the pizza, if if you just love gluten for days, make sure to order the gluten free crust.  They make it in-house, and it is even more delicious than the traditional crust. The food is phenomenal.  The service is pretty good.  The location is convenient, and it is easy to find parking.  I just love this place."}
{"text":"Cibo is in a neighborhood. The patio for dining is real cute with lighted trees and water fountain. Service was excellent. Each of us ordered a pizza and I also had the house salad which was amazing. The pine nuts added a nice touch.
The Margherita pizza was as close as the pizza in Rome,Italy.
The Latina was not my favorite, the slices of tomato had no flavor, but my husband enjoyed it. My son ordered a spicy one which I am sad to say I don't remember the name but it was great! My son's girlfriend got the pizza with anchovies and capers.....she loved it but the rest of us thought it to be disgusting. Tasted way too fishy. Their Pinot Noir was excellent. All in all it was a great evening. live music was nice too. 
They offer valet parking as well."}
{"text":"Amen & Hallelujah!  I finally made it to Cibo!  I can finally join the ranks of the other (almost) 400 Yelpers to post a review!

After hearing SO much about it and working downtown for 10 years, it sure has taken me a long time to get there!  Even the deserted patio (at 5:30 on a Thursday in August) made me happy.  Walking inside, instantly greeted by a friendly host, followed by an equally friendly server.  Service was stellar, attentive, kind, informed, relaxed but not lazy, and suggesting menu items which I always appreciate.

We decided on the special pizza of the night.  Pizza Marechiaro : Fresh Bufala Mozzarella, San Marzano Dop, Chopped basil and Sea salt!  Like a \"super-margherita\" the server said.  How could we NOT get it?  We also go the Pesto Salad which came with roasted potatoes, a light pesto dressing, and delicious bread to go with.

The salad was delicious as was the pizza!  The ingredients were super fresh, the crust was the perfect amount of chewy, the prices were reasonable, and YES there was not a two hour wait to go with the food (even though, I still love the other place too!).  The only part that I didn't love was that the super fresh tomato-ey sauce made the crust a little droopy when I picked it up.  My favorite is a crispy crust that doesn't fall when you take a bite, but hey, small price to pay for perfection every where else.

Even the tiny little flowers in the tiny little bud vase on the table made my day!  I can't wait to go back again . . . and again . . . and again.  Lucky me I work about a mile away!  You (may or may not) know me, I hardly give five stars on just one visit, but trust me, this has five stars written all over it!!"}
{"text":"Neat little romantic place, beautiful atmosphere, especially at night. Delicious food and in authentic Italian pronunciation, and amazing, friendly staff. Get reservations, or else you may have a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"Because someone yelled at me for doling out stars like candy, I now feel guilty when I give out five stars for a restaurant I've only visited once.  Do they deserve the fifth star?  Was it an aberration? Will I look douchey to someone else who, based on more visits, has deemed this place mediocre?

But if you had the grilled spek sandwich (proscuitto, tomatoes, cheese) that I just had on the sublimely amazing bread they have at cibo, you would indeed feel it obligatory to give them all five stars.  The fruit that is served w/ the meal was whatever but I don't care, because it has been a long time since I had a sandwich that good."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the fuss is about this place. I have eaten real pizza in Napoli. My husband lived in Italy for a while and I'm from Brazil. We like fresh authentic food. This place is cute, nice atmosphere. Service was ok, we waited a while to be seated even though they were not busy. Took several minutes to get us menus. We ordered a white pizza and a margherita pizza. Both were OK only. I found the crust hard and dry. The desert menu had only nutella products... 

The taste was blend for the most part. You could not taste quality or freshness out of the pizzas and appetizers we had. The taste was Americanized for sure. 

The menu had a huge selection, kind of overwhelming. Nothing special about the food or the place, over priced actually. The pizza sauce tasted like a can product. We will not be coming back. We will keep POMO Pizzeria as our place for good pizza. To add, the place is a bit too dark. The live music outside was nice but we wish the guy had a better sound/voice so we could try to enjoy being there. The kids liked though. Other reviews that say this is a good place they never tried Pomo yet. Side note, this is NOTHING compared to Pizzaria Bianco or Pomo. You can compare Pomo and Pizzaria Bianco, not this place! This place was all looks and show, nothing else."}
{"text":"I agree with the other Yelpers...skip the insane 2 hour wait at Pizzaria Bianco. The pie here is equally delicious (if not better)! 

Cibo offers the perfect crispy/chewy crust with simple, fresh toppings. 

Fantastico!"}
{"text":"Love myself a good, authentic Italian restaurant, and this one was on point! Came here to catch up with a couple friends, so the ambiance and environment was pretty good for that (though the music did get a bit loud at times!). 

Came here a little earlier than our reservation time, but the hostess was super nice and seated us right away. Went straight upstairs to a more open area and had nice seats with the sun coming in through the windows!
We were also waiting on one person to show up, as they were a little late, but our server was extremely patient and accommodating, waited and explained the menus to us (you're awesome Diane)!

I was personally not as hungry as I normally would be at that time of the night, so I just ordered a pasta. The Farfalle was amazing! We actually ordered 3 for our table as we each got the same dish! The mix of the bowtie pasta with the tomatoes and wild boar bacon was inspiring. The different tastes and textures came together in perfect harmony, making the dish complete with parmesan cheese on top.

Good selection of beers and wines, and even had half priced bottles on special! Server was knowledgeable, explaining each drink you had questions about, and giving an easy to understand answer. 

Definitely a well deserved 4 stars and would love to come back to try more items on the menu sometime!"}
{"text":"Always a great meal. Can be a bit slow sometimes, but it was definitely worth the wait.  I wish this place would enlarge their kitchen and start producing more italian items other than pizza.  We need an excellent all around italian restaurant downtown.  You won't be disappointed in the pizza, ambiance or service here though."}
{"text":"Great food, roasted eggplant is amazing! wild boar bacon pizza, amazing! staff really make this place too, very friendly, cannot fault it in the slightest"}
{"text":"Food was not very good and the service was extremely slow during a slow time (there were maybe 4 tables of people and several servers). They were also not very polite. Don't recommend it at all."}
{"text":"Had a few hours to kill before hopping on a flight and found this place on yelp. all the glowing reviews really drew me in and we weren't disappointed! 

we arrived and found that this charming restaurant is located in the midst of a residential area. we were greeted by the evenings musician, who was playing soft electric guitar behind his back. incredible talent! 

first of all the charcuterie plate (il tagliere) is amazing. so much goodness on the board, I could have just eaten that for dinner. we also ordered a margarita pizza and the pasta bolognese. both were outstanding, packed with flavor! 

if I ever find myself in Phoenix again this will be the first place I go!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, crepes and choclichello...  (chocolate version of limoncello).  Yum.  Go early to avoid waiting."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday with my boyfriend and some family. Awesome food and awesome service! I can't wait to go back to downtown phoenix and get some awesome pizza!"}
{"text":"Best Nutella Cr√™pe with fresh strawberries and mascarpone OMG! TO DIED FOR! Patio is beautiful and romantic"}
{"text":"I just couldn't wait to try this place out and I Heard how awesome it was.
We ordered a margarita pizza with anchovies on it, what they brought out was an artichoke pizza, they took that away and brought us a marinara pizza with anchovies on it.. No cheese or basil. I ordered the homemade roasted pork belly sandwich I think it was called after asking the waitress what her favorite dish on the menu was. It came out soggy she didn't offer ketchup or anything to put on the Fry's but I wanted malt vinegar her she provided it i'll sonic vinegar. Anyway I'm gonna give this place a benefit of the doubt and go back because it really was cool place that  has a good vibe to it."}
{"text":"I have been here before and had a great experience, though that was years ago. That night we went with a group of friends, there were 8 of us. First, our waitress was extremely rude and dismissive. I work in the restaurant industry and where service is concerned, she definitely failed. She was impatient with us, when my friend asked for a clean plate, she investigated the plate before deeming it worthy of being replaced. I kept asking for more water, 4 times and on the 3rd time she just ignored me, physically looked around me, while getting my friends drinks. Finally, the same friend ordered water for us because she was pretending not to hear me. The food was mediocre at best, which was really disappointing. Then we ordered dessert and got a crepe with nutella and strawberries. While it was delicious, there were maybe 3 strawberries in the entire thing, which was a drag since the bites with strawberries were so good. When it came to the check, she split it by \"couple\" took our payments and then completely forgot about one of the couples and just brought it back with the card, not run. We were all just stunned that she had added 20% gratuity to all of our checks (Im sure is policy with larger groups) but we would not have left it for her awful service. I can't recommend this place anymore, that's for sure."}
{"text":"What more can you say about Cibo other than To Die For!!! The staff is great, very helpful. This is a downtown gem that cannot be missed!"}
{"text":"My mil is in town and we decided to check this place out. The atmosphere was very inviting. Plenty of outdoor seating, as well as indoor. 

Once seated we ordered some drinks. Mainly water for the 6 of us with one desert iced tea, which wasn't very good. 

Next we ordered, a pizza margarita, pizza with spicy salami, a meatball sandwich, pesto salad, cous cous salad and a mele salad. The order took quite awhile to come out, but was definitely worth the wait. We all shared the food. And the reviews do not steer you wrong. The cous cous salad and pizza was amazing! As was the meatball sandwich. I think my only gripe was the cheapy type chicken on the mele salad. Reminded me of subway chicken. Eww. 

We will definitely come back for more pizza!!"}
{"text":"There are not too many dining experiences in the valley that rival sitting on the patio at Cibo on a cool night. I could sit there and eat copious amounts of the burratta with prosciutto and be absolutely blissful."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been back here and this time it was the Cibi we all know and love.   The server was excellent.  Very cheerful and engaging.   The food was the usual perfection.   And of course the crepes were the perfect dessert.   This place will always be on my A list."}
{"text":"I love love love their pizza. I've been there several times and I've had good service each time. This is the place that we take friends to for pizza. The wait time has not been more than 20 minutes even on a First Friday."}
{"text":"This place gets 1 star for the cute adorable patio.  Besides that this place sucks.  What is all the hype about this place??  Pizza was sub-par, very generic ,nothing special!  And the Nutella crepe for dessert... Is very pretty looking, but it's a Nutella mess!  Yuck too much Nutella!  And yes.... The flies are everywhere!  It's too bad cuz they have a really cute patio that's cozy.  But the food is a 2 thumbs down.  Over rated.  Will NOT be back."}
{"text":"ah yes another review. Went to Cibo with a large group of 14 current and past co-workers to hear our co-worker and friend play guitar there. Everything was great at first. Nice  service, nice atmosphere, as allways, good food. There was another large party on the patio with us and it was still quiet and relaxing. My co-worker brought his dog and it was cool that they allow that. Then I looked down and realized it was 7:30, and I needed to go. Some people were going to stay and drink more, but I had to go. So I asked the server if she could put $20 of our bill on my card. Um, I guess not. Get this- they DONT SPLIT CHECKS, and only take 4 debit/credit cards per bill. So not only could I not leave until everyone paid, but we were going to have a hard time paying the bill +20% added gratuity b/c most of us ( being 40 and under) only carry credit/debit cards. The. best part was when I asked her to put $20 on my card she looked at me and said \"What do you want me to do with the card?\" hmm, I want to pay for my food lady. GEEZ sorry. ALL of this on a Monday night. Apparently we were $2 short ( go figure with 10 different people) and she actually brought out a calculator and tossed it at us... treated us like we were bums.The servers attitude alone was rude and ruined for us.I will go back (if I'm allowed) as the food is good and the service, usually, is good too.( At another point she said she couldn't go inside and check on something b/c \"its too busy in there\". Hm sorry your place of work is busy on a Monday night during a recession. Don't worry, I doubt it will last for long.)"}
{"text":"I'm reluctant to give 5 stars when I rate things in general however there is no question that Cibo deserves them all! Every time I've been here the food is consistently delicious and fresh tasting. The restaurant itself is a cool little house turned yummy Italian joint. One of my favorite places to eat downtown by far."}
{"text":"Love this cute restaurant. Their patio is great and a bit romantic. Their pizza is very good but we go for the crepes! I also love their bolognese pasta. You can tell it's homemade. The pizza can get a bit soggy sometimes."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, and the pizza and sandwiches, while simple, are always delicious and well done.  Parking is a little difficult.  The White Sangria is lovely.  This is a prime downtown lunch spot, but its viability as dinner location has been diminished with the addition of the adjacent Vig."}
{"text":"This was my first Yelp review, and now after visiting Cibo at least a dozen, I had to write a quick update to mention two very important things I didn't mention in my first review: Crepes and Limoncello. 

Yep, the Nutella crepes are magnificent. A perfect way to end a meal.... well that is unless you end it with the most awesome drink in the world: Limoncello.  Homemade and worth every last drop. It's an experience I won't soon forget. 

Also, I must mention another awesome waiter. No, not the Diane Lane look alike, but a just as memorable dude with prophetic tats and a zen-like, jedi-master spirit. Not only do you get great food at Cibo, you also get uber-friendly service. Rock on, Cibo, I can't wait for a dozen more visits!"}
{"text":"Oh boy, you cannot go wrong with this place! I LOVE their pizza. I usually get the pizza with spicy salame or sausage. For lunch you can get a personal size pizza and a salad for about $12-13 bucks and for this quality, it's totally worth it!!!

Whether you are here for a business lunch or a dinner date, this is an ideal place for good food, a beautiful atmosphere (you have to sit outside) and amazing service.

I cannot wait until my next visit here!"}
{"text":"Went to Cibo after an event downtown. ¬†Did not have an issue with seating since we arrived early. ¬†Service was very good and efficient. ¬†Food arrived quickly. ¬†Loved the cozy bungalow setting of the restaurant.

We tried the T&K salad and the Salsiccia Con Patate (sausage and roasted potato) pizza. ¬†Liked the ingredients of the salad made of spinach, oranges, cranberries, pumpkin seeds and goat cheese. ¬†The dressing was not as flavorful as I expected. ¬†Maybe it was the bowl it was served in. ¬†Dressing was at the bottom and was not tossed well with the salad which made the spinach very bland.

Pizza and the dough was delicious. ¬†My one criticism I have as with all other sausage pizzas from other establishments is how much they skimp on the sausage. ¬†Definitely should be more when you are paying $14.5 for a pizza. ¬†I would also slice the potatoes on the pizza instead of diced.

Will definitely return to try the other pizzas."}
{"text":"Cibo was okay, it's one of those places I will never choose to go back to myself but if a friend told me she made reservations there I wouldn't complain either.

I thought it was a bit overpriced for what you get. We ordered appetizers that were super tiny even though our waitress said we could easily share between 4. They weren't even that good. The decor is really nice, that is what drew me to go in the first place.
As some people pointed out the staff was friendly to the point of awkwardness. Our waitress interrupted our conversation quite a few times and went on to talk about Cibo's whole history without us asking. I was getting together with friends that I hadn't seen in a while and it was a little irritating having our waitress stand around and talk with us for a while when we were trying to catch up.

The biggest issue I had was they had run out of pizza dough so the only thing we wanted to eat from the menu was a no-go. It was disorganized but maybe they have changed since I first went (it was within the first week they opened). Still, I probably won't go back since the food was \"meh\" and the service was even more so."}
{"text":"Oh the pizza and calzones gods live here.  My 2nd most favorite pizza in Phoenix.  Now the calzones - the bread is the light as a cloud bread that isn't soggy or heavy.  It must be godly magic but after eating a filled with meats and cheeses calzone from Cibo - you don't feel like you ate a loaf of bread.  Love the ambiance of this little place and we have also ordered take out from here as well. Hubby and I will visit soon and be blessed by the pizza and calzone gods once again.  Thank you Cibo."}
{"text":"Love Cibo! They should open an old town Gilbert location. Everything I have had on the menu has been great. They have a variety of fresh menu options from salads, hot/cold sandwiches, and pizza. Very cozy atmosphere with outdoor patio seating. There is a grid bike station nearby and valet parking."}
{"text":"Cibo is an unassuming little gem in a downtown Phoenix neighborhood. The ambience is perfect and the outdoor patio is gorgeous. Perfect place for a quiet, romantic meal. 
We ordered several things to get a good taste, and everything was heavenly. From the perfectly cooked pizza with a mouth watering array of expertly balanced flavors, to the fresh salad, the otherworldly meatball sandwich, and finally to the sinfully fantastic crepes with Nutella and strawberries and whip cream. You can't go wrong, no matter what you order. 
This place is quite the treat and the prices are quite reasonable for the unparalleled quality of the food you receive. 
Forget about Pizzeria Bianco and make your way here instead. It's only a mile away from them, but the difference is night and day."}
{"text":"We dined here w/ a large party @ 8:30 on a Sat night. This is important for two reasons. The first is they were out of the beet salad AND the bolognese pasta presumably b/c we were the last diners. But we were really surprised that an italian restaurant was out of a staple dish like bolognese. Second, when we got up to leave not one staff person was in sight. No \"come again soon\" or \"thanks for dining with us.\". It felt odd.

The bread w/ olive oil for dipping was awful. Really dry and tasteless. Ordered the Arancini balls which came w/ fresh tomato sauce and were very good. For entrees, GF and I both had lukewarm scallops/tiger shrimp over fettucini in a light tomato sauce. It really needed to be served hot. It was disappointing. Friend Bill ordered Zuppa de Mari which arrived, strangely enough, on a long flat dish and not in a soup bowl w/ out any broth. Zuppa? Not really. 

Coffee was delish - served tableside from a glass press. Wine corkage was still $7 and I think they charge so much b/c the place is so small and they don't want people to linger. 

There is potential here but they need to execute the basics better. I'm sure they'll figure it out the way their other two Regent Sq businesses (Mcbrooms Beer & D's Sixpax) have grown over time."}
{"text":"Saturday night was our second time at Cibo and we were NOT disappointed.  We started at Bianco and were disappointed when they told our party of 6 that it would be a 4 hour wait.  So we decided to give Cibo a shot.  Great choice.  They sat us on their beautiful patio immediately and they had live music.  James was our server and he was wonderful.  We started with the Il Tagliere and the 3 pairs of Bruschetta, amazing.  Then I think for our party of 6, we got 7 pizza's, they were all delicisous. I think everyone's favorite was the Procida, it was light and fresh and simply amazing.  I would come back here again anytime."}
{"text":"Pizza in my mouth hole! Okay I should probably start off with a classier intro, but let's get real and put some Cibo pizza in there all ready. 

Cibo was lucky enough to set the stage for Andrea K's birthday on Saturday night and I was lucky enough to attend for the first time. The restaurant is a converted house in central phoenix that looks very cozy and warm. I say 'looks' because I had to eat outside in the freezing cold dressed inappropriately. Come on Phoenix, I didn't move here for culture, I moved here for a promise of HEAT! 

Um, anyway, our group was too large to fit in any of the rooms inside, so we were seated in the front yard with space heaters sporadically placed around us. Our server was very friendly, and though he seemed to be serving the ENTIRE clientele of the restaurant, made his way over to us frequently.  The ladies who delivered the meals weren't terribly effusive, whispering what the order was and trying to set it down in front of whoever was closest, instead of the right person, so I ended up shouting out everything and directing the traffic.  But at the end of the night Cibo was VERY cool about the various methods of payments we utilized for the bill and with such a large group that is generous.

I ordered the Smoked Salmon pizza with arugula and capers added. It was great, I ate almost the entire pizza myself. I did manage to take some home, and what I noticed the next day was that it was uber salty. I love salty food but this was way more than I remembered from the night before and off-putting.  I liked Cibo and I would go back there (in warmer weather) because I think the 'designer' pizzas are fairly reasonable in price and the ambiance is nice."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the entire world! I send everyone I know there.  I love CiBO!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the ambience with live music at dusk on a warm evening. Just don't be stuck at the corner table like we were. Some might say the tables inside are intimate/romantic; I'd say more along claustrophobic. The bathrooms, though, are large.  

I took issue with service. The waitress was very short (not in length), not attentive, and fazed from her job. Water glasses came 2/3 full, which was weird. I found the pizzas to be just overdone enough to have an off-putting bitterness. And I did not like the tiramisu. It was just thick heavy cream without the nice texture of freshly soaked ladyfingers.  

So I don't know if I'll be back..maybe with a smaller group on a not-so-busy night."}
{"text":"This little place is quaint and romantic with excellent food. I recommend any of the deserts. Perfect place for outdoor dining during the cooler time of the year and don't worry they have heaters too during the winter months. The wine selection is fabulous, and this is not just a place for dinner. I had my first lunch here with a best friend who works in the downtown area. It's a great place to stop in and have a bite at lunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic Pizza, can't beat location.  Cibo has much more than pizza.  Their salads are wonderfual and you must save room for the crepes.  Trust me, they are worth the calories.
Few places have such ambiance and allow you to sit outside and relax."}
{"text":"My sister has ranted about Cibo for weeks now, and how much she LOVES it. So needless to say I was excited to find out that one of our friends was having a group birthday dinner here this weekend. 

The decor of Cibo is so cute and charming. The lights outside on the trees are a good addition to outside lighting. The environment is good for a date night, wine night with girlfriends, or family dinner. 

Since this was a large birthday dinner we were seated outside. When we first arrived there were no seats available for my sister and I. While they figured out how to add a few extra seats we decided to go inside to order a drink from the bar. While standing at the bar our waitress from outside came up to us (who we had not even seen yet) and \"barked\" at us that we can order drinks from outside. She then very RUDELY asked what can she get us. We order our drinks and my sister proceeded to ask her is we can start a tab, she again barked at us and said NO they don't do tabs. I could not believe how rude she was being. My sister casually said \"ok I will pay cash, I feel like I am starting to annoy you\" Her response was \"ok thanks\"!!!! I was appalled!! 

Once we got seated outside the waitress' rude behavior continued. She just kept barking things at the guests, such as \"are you ready to order?\" in the rudest tone of voice! It was not just us, I witness her rudeness towards other guests at the table. My boyfriend ordered a beer and she brought the wrong one out. I corrected her and she says \"oh we were out of that one, but this beer is pretty much the same thing\". I am sorry but when is it EVER acceptable to do this. The correct thing would to come back tell the guest and recommend the similar beer or ask if there is anything else they would like. 

Through out the time she continue to reach over guests without saying excuse me. I witnessed her spilling water on a guest without apologizing. I realize we were a larger party but if you cannot handle it ask for help or trade tables with someone. I am sorry you got the largest table in the place and made a hefty tip (not from me however) 

The ONLY reason I rated Cibo a 4 instead of a 2 was because their food really was fantastic and my sister promises that she has never received anything less than great service from the waiters. 

Recommendation to Cibo, fire your bitchy server I have NEVER received worse service in my life!! Being so rude to your guests is not good for your business!"}
{"text":"very good woodfired pizza! My wife, daughter, and I had the vegetariana (tomato sauce, mozz, mush. artichokes, roasted red peppers, and zuchini)  the quattro formaggi (fontina, parmigiano, and mozz) sans the gorgonzola and basil (too strong for the lil one's palate) and the Rustico (mozz, prozjoot, and arugula) respectively. light and chewy crust, fresh, high quality ingredients, overall spectacular pizza.  We are not from Phoenix, but visit often. We have heard of the mythical, never ending line that Bianco possesses, but I couldn't imagine the pizza being any better than this, maybe it's the selection they have, I don't know. My daughter savored the marscapone and nutella filled crepe that she got for making a happy plate! But it was much to small to satiate all  three of us without wanting to order 3 more, and at $5 a piece, we'll just stop at the store and get the ingredients. Overall really good dining experience, a little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Trying not to sound like a broken record here, but my wife and I have been here a couple times. The ambience is great, and on cool summer nights you cant beat it. Food is always great whether for lunch or dinner. The wait staff could use some help... during the day it seems to be better than during the evening, but may because of how busy they are."}
{"text":"Best atmosphere. Worst pizza. Ever!!! Bland sausage, bland cheese, bland and watery tomato sauce. Rubbery calamari with noncomplimentary sauce. I have no idea what the hype is all about."}
{"text":"The food is incredible! The salads are fresh, unique and so delicious. And the crepes are amazing! One of our favorite spots. Also, very charming decor and if you land a spot on the patio, even better."}
{"text":"This place has great ambiance, set it an old house with seating in multiple rooms and a lovely outdoor space. The decor is eclectic.

They have a nice wine and beer selection and the antipasto speciale was delicious! The bruschetta looked amazing and I'm sorry we didn't give that a try.

The pizzas were definitely tasty and reasonably priced for dinner. They have a changing special pizza and wine pairing...a nice way to try new things.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was at Cibo a couple years ago- I had read about the place online and decided to check it out while on vacation in Phoenix. Easy to find with the GPS in tow. 
The tables are terribly close together- but cozy. We had brought two kids with us- not really kid menu friendly. No highchairs, boosters or anything of that nature. I wished I had known that prior to going- perhaps a note on the website regarding their inability to accommodate small children. 
The waitress was not friendly at all- she seemed annoyed that there were kids with us and rolled her eyes at us a few times. 
The pizza was good- but enjoyed the antipasto plate more than the pizza. The patio was nice, but it was closed because it was \"only 64 degrees\"-- shorts weather for us. 
They seemed like they were trying to rush us out of there to turn the tables quickly-- or to get rid of the kids, I am not sure. 

I would not go out of my way to visit again."}
{"text":"After reading so many good reviews I was excited to try Cibo. To me it just didn't live up to the hype. However, the patio was perfect for an afternoon lunch in the shade. I had the Salsiccia Saltimbocca Caldi which was good but VERY greasy. I'd definitely try it again next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Came here on Sat evening. Has a little cute patio with really really nice jazz band. Wait was only 20 minutes to sit outdoor. Easy nice selection of food. I think this will be a nice place to come out on the date. The bar only offer beer and wine. Also we got eaten by mosquitos for sitting out! Other than that, a great little place to stop by for any occasion!"}
{"text":"Right off the bat when you pull up to Cibo, you get the feeling that this will be a different experience.  It's located in a what looks like a residential neighborhood, with older nicely kept homes around it.  

They have a very nice patio with a cool ambiance to it, right off the street but not noisy. And lots of heaters on the patio.

The inside of the place is really cool as it's an old bungalow house, with very few apparent modifications, so it retains the original charm.

Service was very good, with great knowledge of the menu and ingredients, since there were definitely some things on the menu I didn't know about.  The server was attentive, but not overly so.  Given their menu, I think they're aware that people often have take a bit longer to decide what to order.

And of course the food..

Awesome antipasto, fresh ingredients, a REAL Italian menu.

This would be a good place to bring people from out of town to show them we have some cool ambiance and great food right in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is a pretty neat place. Outdoor seating is plentiful, indoor seating is spacious yet cozy. I'm not really a person who eats Italian food a lot honestly. I rarely ever go out to eat Italian and I took a lot of courage and convincing from my friend to go here. The pizza was actually really good, the crust was crunchy, thin and chewy in some parts. Have to say that I enjoyed that the most. The meatballs in my opinion weren't my style, I'm not really the one to complain about portion size but the meatballs were a little too big. But still good. I think I'll probably come here another day maybe at night time to see the nice outdoor lighting."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Cibo made out to be a great place for a casual yet romantic (and inexpensive) date night. My girlfriend and I sat in the outside seating area that was nicely lit with lights strung about the trees. There were also heaters near the tables the keep us Arizona folk warm during these cool winter nights. The live musician played great background music that wasn't too loud or overpowering which made it easy to converse across the table without straining to hear. Our waitress was nice and didn't make us feel rushed. I would highly recommend both the bruschetta as an appetizer and the genova pizza to share. The genova pizza is topped with roasted potatoes which is actually REALLY good! Definitely planning to return to try out the crepes. Overall, highly recommend if you're looking for a casual and delicious night!"}
{"text":"I've been to Cibo a few times in the past and most times its been pretty good but this last time will make it hard to go back. My friend and I came to Cibo on a Friday night and we decided to sit out on the patio so we could enjoy the nice evening weather. We each ordered their pizza special (1/2 off) great deal.  The food itself was good. I just finished my first piece when my friend was startled and noticed a mouse on the patio! I immediately put my feet up on my chair as I'm terrified of mice. Yes I know this is downtown and its the patio but there is no way Im going to enjoy my meal when theres a mouse thats wandering around on the patio so close to our table. Once the mouse goes back in its little hiding spot in the patio we leave our meals where they are and go inside to tell the hostess that theres a mouse wandering near our table and how we would like to move inside. She did not seem surprised or even said sorry. She was just like ok I will find your server and I'll speak to my manager. The manager just came to us and asked us where we were seated and we pointed to our table. She then said that there was not much room available inside. So we were like ok, can we get our meal packed then and she said she would.  There was no apology for the inconvenience of the mouse being there or not having any other seating. Our server then came and settled the bill with us and also didn't apologize, she didn't speak with us at all. They were almost annoyed that we were inconveniencing them for wanting to move and not just being able to sit and pretend a mouse was on the patio. Mice in a eating establishment are a big deal!"}
{"text":"Alright, so I'm just going to start off by saying that I was running on a short amount of time in the area & my only main mission was the crepes. lol. YES, you read correctly. I'm a huge sucker for an awesome, crisp to perfection, deliciously stuffed, delightfully tasteful crepe & I will tell you this, they are HARD to find.

Before calling it a night last night, I didn't want to take the chances of missing the opportunity to enjoy one of these babies before our departure back home. So, I called in an order around 10pm (luckily they close at 11 on saturday nights). I ordered the banana & nutella crepe w/strawberries added to it. I didn't want the 'a la mode' as I didn't want the ice cream melting on the drive home. 

O.M.G.......This was delicious! I HAD to open it up in the car to see what it looked like (wish I hadn't, it made me hungrier) it looked amazing! As soon as we got back to our rooms, I couldn't help but start indulging it. It was perfectly crispy on the outside with drizzled chocolate and powdered sugar on top, the inside was even more of a delight being completely stuffed!

 I'll definitely be back, you've won Cibo. Let's see what your entree's have to offer next."}
{"text":"First visit and I have to say, the food was outstanding and the ambiance was perfect.

I had heard good things about Cibo in the past so I was a bit confused by the less-than-stellar reviews showing up lately but decided to give it a chance anyway and I couldn't be happier I did. The evening's weather was beautiful so my date and I sat out on the patio. Twinkling string lights and lush plant life complimented by the trickling of a few water features really helped set the mood. Giving the patio almost a Naples feel to it. 

We decided to order the caprese salad to split and a couple pizzas (one veggie, one mushroom) to share. First out came the salad and I was already impressed after the first bite. The tomatoes were sweet and juicy and the mozzarella tasted so fresh I swear I heard it moo. Next came the pizza. Now, understand, I consider myself a bit of a pizza snob so It takes a pretty good pie to impress me. That being said, Cibo impressed the hell out of me! The crust was airy and elastic with that perfect rustic baking taste. Again, the fresh mozzarella and ripe tomatoes made an appearance and with the addition of our toppings I was a happy man. I only wish I wasn't such a hog so I could have saved some for lunch the next day. 

The only reason I couldn't give Cibo a five star rating was the service. Although our server was as nice and the food came out timely, there was a definite lack of attention. We were in a bit of A time crunch and I had to end up tracking her down to ask for the tab, then again to actually pay it. That being said, everyone has their off nights and the food was so delicious that I well be back many times."}
{"text":"After shredding downtown with the little lady we decided to check out this quaint little restaurant. First, their is a lot of outside seating. The ambiance outside is very nice as well. The inside is smaller but nicely decorated. This is a great place for dates or romantic one-on-ones. Our meals were great. We had the calamari, a pizza, and a wood fired sandwich. 

Pros
- great ambiance
- good food
- decent prices

Cons 
- limited inside seating
- just okay service
- parked in the back. Trash bin was overflowing and smell turned us off."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great sandwiches at lunch and the pizza is among the best in town.  Cool setting - great for a casual date.  Sit outside when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"First time here, and I WILL come back when in Phoenix. The Caprese salad as an appetizer was so bountiful with tomatoes and large amounts of mozzarella. The saltimbucca sandwiches are delicious."}
{"text":"Went to Cibo on a cold arizona December night. The outdoor heaters were clutch because the weather was below freezing. Ordered a pizza and the ravioli special. Tiny raviolis but hit the spot. The outdoor patio setting was lit beautifully. The pizza was decent. It's the perfect spot for a date. Hopefully I'll ditch my dad next time and bring one."}
{"text":"We love it here, we keep coming back. Patio is charming and casual, the pear salad is my favorite"}
{"text":"The service was excellent and so was the food for the most part. Did lack some flavor and they did not have a lot of the drinks they claimed to have in the menu."}
{"text":"The service, ambiance, and food is absolutely the best. You feel like you have escaped the heat and desert for split second and found a beautiful oasis tucked into another city. This restaurant is the best, the owners and staff are happy to be there and so are we!"}
{"text":"I read Cibo opened in 2009 so they must have been a little ahead of their time when they opened this quaint little italian pizza and sandwich restaurant in downtown Phoenix area.  This seems to be the trend in 2010+, find an old house or business and convert into a comfortable, home-style, eating experience.  The house concept was relaxing, in a old neighborhood of brick homes and full-grown shade trees and at the same time, seeing the downtown Phoenix landscape on the near horizon.

The Drinks: n/a
Didn't feel like any drinks on this visit although the menu selection looked decent.

The Food: ****
We started with the Pear Salad, organic spinach, pear, pecorino cheese, honey and toasted almonds.  Very refreshing, and probably could have stopped here.

The bread basket was a little weak.  Didn't feel bad not getting seconds,   where normally I would.

I had the Calzone.  Much bigger than I expected.  Good pizza dough/crust, smooth and not too spicy sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, prosciutto and salami.  I don't recall any other ingredients in the calzone like onions, bell peppers or mushrooms.  More of a creamy texture like folding up a slice of pizza and eating it.  Very good.

Kat had the bolognaise.  Again, good flavor in the meat sauce, homemade noodles and healthy portion.

The Dessert: *****
Mostly crepe menu items like Nutella and berries or moscapone and lemon zest with powered sugar.  Nice end to a good meal.

The Service: **
Our waitress was nice but the rest of the staff seemed a little \"tired\" and unexcited.  We intentionally left our water bottle on the edge of the table to see if they would offer to refill.  No such luck.  Super bowl week is just starting so they better step up their game."}
{"text":"Cute place tucked away in a residential type area of downtown. We went for lunch and sat on the patio which was casual and refreshing, especially in the AZ fall. I split a salad and pizza with a friend and it was a perfect amount. Though not the best, they have a solid thin crust pizzas that will fulfill the craving when it comes."}
{"text":"After a year of debating whether to make the drive downtown for this place, I am happy to say that I finally did. I'm sorry it wasn't sooner.

When you approach the entrance, you get a good feeling, unlike the rest of the overly bright, pretentious, ubiquitous strip-mall restaurants around the valley. No, this is a house, surrounded by other houses in a real neighborhood - so the setting is beautiful.

Now the food:

We started with the bruschetta. Outstanding. I think while we were eating it our eyes were rolling back in our head! I had a Lagunitas IPA, it's nice to see they have a good IPA to complement their Fatta in Casa cuisine. 

We move along to the infamous pizza (though the pasta specials were tantalizing - but had to try the pizza since it's my first time here). We ordered the Diavola with ricotta cheese. This pizza took me back to Trastevere in Rome. Crust was tasty, browned with a slight char, but not too much. Sauce was fresh but not watery, and the cheese was delicious. And though we were both full after a couple of pieces, we could not stop eating it.

Of course we had to try the dessert ( Nutella desserts will always be a winner). We split the Nutella Crepe and each had a cappuccino - and no dirty looks from the waiter when ordering a cappuccino after dinner in America! Delicious, a great way to end the evening.

I will travel from Chandler to Cibo any night of the week because this is a place that does it right. I almost never give 5 stars on a first time visit, but this wasn't a \"lucky\" night. Everything was top quality with genuine care and love put into it and that was quite evident. Bravo!

Grazie mille per una bella notte! Ci vediamo presto!"}
{"text":"You can literally never go wrong with cibo. Everything is delicious! The white pizzas are our favorites. And don't miss out on getting a crepe. They are the best in town!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, really cool atmosphere, and make sure you save room for dessert, because the crepes are awesome!

It's also a really great place for a date. The pizzas and salads almost seem taylor-made for two-person sharing, and the atmosphere (despite the crowds) is very romantic."}
{"text":"So we finally decided to give Cibo another chance and I'm so glad we did!

I love love love their patio. It's very cute and romantic especially with all the lights wrapped around the trees. The heaters keep you warm on a chilly night and it's much quieter than their indoor space. This place is a great date spot. 

We both had the Prosciutto Cruda pizza and had wanted to try the burrata, but unfortunately they'd been out of it for the last week so we ordered the bruschetta instead. Our waiter also recommended the Valpolicella Ripasso, which was ok, but it was a little light for our tastes. The pizza was really good (the fresh ingredients really come through), but we weren't the biggest fans of the crust. I like something more substantial and airy. But  for a thin crust pizza it wasn't soggy at all. A big plus! The bruschetta was also ok (don't get me wrong I still ate all of it and would order it again), but each bite just needs a little more of a punch. 

Service was great and we met Karen, the owner, before we left and she is a doll. We had a much better experience this time around and we will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Recently reopened with new menu and chef. Not impressed at all. I ordered the half portion of the beef pasta and got the full and was charged for the full. But when I received it I thought it was the half because it was very small. The pasta and beef were bland. No one else liked their meal and the table which included two men that are not hard to please. They also had run out of the other pasta we had wanted originally which seemed strange because we had an early reservation and the restaurant was not full - he said they made it fresh every day and it was first come first serve. the restaurant is byob and they tell you to grab wine from the loft down the street which they own. We got one red and one white for $40 and neither of those were good either. In total we spent $170 and were not impressed with anything we ate - which included two pastas, a lamb dinners a clam pasta and a flatbread and oysters for an appetizer. There are MUCH better restaurants in Pittsburgh. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Ok, this is making my pizza at lunch choice difficult.  I love POMO on 1st street and am beginning to like La Piazza Locale also on 1st St. so adding this one into the miix is not helping.  

Where Cibo wins out is in dinning atmosphere, it is in a house and has a wonderful garden/patio area.  Nice feel.  

It is a small walk from downtoan but I would not recommend making the hike in the summer as I did last year.  Too long and too hot for the same quality pizza that you can get closer to downtown.

Very nice thin crust pizza, napoli style.  Nice salad and sandwihich options also."}
{"text":"Cibo is our absolute favorite place for date night. It is beautiful at night with the lights and big trees and live music on certain nights. Their neapolitan style pizza is amazing and our favorite. The staff is always friendly and attentive, there's a decent wine list, a short beer list but does have some craft beers. Dessert crepes are amazing! Cannot say enough good things about this place! It is definitely one beautiful place for a date etc. There is valet parking in the back, but you could also park along the streets and walk."}
{"text":"Wonderful outdoor seating area. There is always amazing live music playing. The service was good. And the food was great. They let you do half & half pizzas, even with the sauce."}
{"text":"I went today for happy hour. $5 pizza was actually quite good, $4 wine and beer. It doesn't get better than $9.45 with tax for pizza and a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Before I found out \"Cibo\" means \"food\" in Italian, I thought it was a Mexican restaurant, deceived by its extraordinarily cute exterior. 

Cibo is, on the most part, a pizza place. The parking lot is full of very nice BMWs and Audis. So it must have done something right.

The pizzas at Cibo remind me a lot of those at La Grande Orange: gourmet toppings, thin sourdough crust, and fragrant cheese. We ordered three pizzas for the table, all tasted great, except that... they were awfully similar. 

Granted, I probably shouldn't expect too much of a variety when we were having pizzas (for a birthday celebration), but I was hoping for something life-changing, like the slice of pizza I had in Rome. Well, Cibo is no food hauled from Rome for sure, but it is nonetheless a good place to chill and get solid food in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Nice venue, nice service, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Please let me start this review with my usual preface: I am Italian, born and raised in Italy.

I have recently been to Cibo during a business trip in Phoenix, actually thanks to Madonna. Yes, that night a Madonna concert made all places busy in downtown, so, thanks to my colleague who yelped Cibo, we went there. The staff was very friendly, and our waitress was sweet. 

My colleagues ordered some pasta that looked great, but those were somewhat small portions. 

I ordered my favorite pizza: aragula, shaved parmesan, and prosciutto crudo. Maybe this is not a popular combination here in the US, but...did I mention I am Italian? I guess I did...

So, to be concise... my pizza was a 5 star Pizza. I thought I was in Rome or something! But no, no, I was in Phoenix Arizona, USA. 

Are you still reading my review???? GO GO GO...Cibo is awesome!

OK since you are not that hungry, I want to talk about their patio. Actually, calling it patio reduces its awesomeness. It is a true Italian \"giardino,\" it reminded me of my summer vacations in Italy.

The only downside is that in their menu there is a typo on an Italian word... LOL... 

I wish I lived in Phoenix..."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pizza spot in Arizona. The margherita pizza is phenomenal. The whole basil leaves are a nice touch. I use to work right next door so we ordered from here frequently. Here are some items I suggest:

-Meatballs
-Margherita Pizza (any pizza really)
-Tuna Melt

The ambiance is pretty neat at night. It's homey and cozy. One of my co-workers actually proposed to his wife here! 

Haven't had a chance to try the drinks yet but I hear they do a good job!"}
{"text":"Darling house with a wonderful jazz player outside to set the mood. I usually end up going in the evening time-the ambiance is always right, the lights in the trees and the gentle breeze. 

The thin crust pizza is just wonderful! I love the Procida, Rustica, Margherita for all right reasons, perfection! I've had a sample of the homemade pasta that too was just wonderful.  BUT if you want to know the real reason I go...I go for the Nutella shake...I mean the Frappe alla Nutella. What a great piece of heaven on this Earth! I'm not even kidding you, I'm hooked!

I've been there when its busy but game plan ahead of time and get ready to have all of your senses say thank you!"}
{"text":"This is such a sweet little spot. I had a friend visiting from San Francisco and she, along with my husband and I, arrived on a Saturday evening just as the (previously mentioned) wedding party had departed. We were greeted by the super sweet propietor and his wife. We ordered a drink (wine and beer prices were really reasonable) and took in the early 1900's bungalow where the restaurant is housed. There was so much character here (and so few TVs!) I really felt like I was back in Oakland.

We were seated quickly on their lovely patio. It was a gorgeous night and the ambiance was absolutely perfect. Our server admited to being a bit overwhelmed but still managed to give us prompt, humorous, and personable service.

We had brushcetta and a salad for an appetizer. Both were good. For dinner we each ordered a pizza - margarita (excellent), capricciosa (good), and salsiccia con patate (excellent). My SF friend was not as impressed as I was, but I truly enjoyed the food and the overall experience. Will definitely be back. Oh! And we found it on Yelp!"}
{"text":"Love Cibo! So cute for a night out with your special someone and if you're a pasta lover I would definitely? recommend getting one of the two options. Cats do roam around though so that's a little weird while you're eating dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved to the Phoenix area and for out first date night out away from the house and baby, we were blown away by this restaurant. The food was delicious, and as close as we have come to real Italian outside of our home as we have ever had (they have rice balls too!). The atmosphere is great, with live music outside, and Italian music on the radio inside, and lights strung everywhere. We're usually a little critical because we used to eat out so often, we weren't expecting this place to live up to the reviews. But it does! I definitely recommend trying this place. :)"}
{"text":"Had the gluten free pizza and it was great! Service was quick but not rushed. All was to our liking. Thank you"}
{"text":"We loved the ambiance, loved the location, loved the food, enjoyed ourselves a lot. We are planning on going back, and write a more in depth review, once we try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"The ambience is very casual yet classy! The menu is spectacular pizza is delicious n appetizers are satisfying"}
{"text":"This place is great. Right off of Roosevelt row, quaint shady patio, all out of an old housem. Food is great. Pizzas are perfect size to share or have alone. Service is always good. Great spot overall."}
{"text":"What We Ordered: Tartufata pizza (mushroom, prosciutto, truffle oil), Gnocchi (with cream sauce), Pinot Grigio (Scarpetta)

Service: Our waitress was nice. However, she didn't give us much in the way of promoting the food or guiding our decision. She didn't go over the specials or any of the dishes.

What We Liked:
-Atmosphere: elegant without being pretentious, nice outdoor and indoor, simple decor, charming home converted to restaurant
-Pizza: we enjoyed the pizza, thin crust with a nice wood-fire char. 

What We Disliked:
-The Gnocchi: although the texture was perfect to me (pillowy, soft, handmade), the flavor fell flat. I didn't feel it was special the way a good gnocchi dish is. It is also very small in portion. And although I do agree with the waitress that it was filling, part of enjoying a dish is the initial appearance, and the initial appearance was sad, served in a small cast iron skillet, and looked a bit \"cheap\" with a bread crumb crust. We confirmed it was actually the entree because first glance we thought it was an appetizer. 
-Opted out of desert because we were underwhelmed by the food.

Overall, the service and food fell flat. Which I think is challenging to do with a cream gnocchi dish. I appreciate simple flavor and although  it was certainly rich, the dish just lacked too much in flavor.The pizza was good, however it is comparable to many other pizzerias in the Valley. I want to like this charming place, and I would come back and give it another try if someone else suggested it and wanted to check it out."}
{"text":"The day after Christmas, Mr. M and I met up with Tim S. to give Cibo a try.  We got there a little early to get a table and right away I was taken with how the restaurant looks as we walked up to it.  With all the white lights, outdoor seating, and the pretty bungalow, it felt very welcoming and a much appreciated respite from the typical strip mall setting.  

We were greeted and seated right away by the host, and our server, Jessica, was there right away to take our drink and app orders.  Since it was still happy hour I took advantage of those great deals and ordered the Straccetti ($4) and the Polpette ($6).  We also ordered a glass of house red, which I think is a montepulciano, or maybe a sangiovese...I don't know.  Both are fun to say and it was only four bucks.

Those apps are both 5 star!  I aspire to make a meatball that good.  Flavorful, moist, and accompanied by a nice red sauce and some crusty bread.  The Straccetti are completely addictive and I highly recommend those as well.  The little touches of fresh basil ribbons and slivers of fresh parmigiano just made that one even more perfect.  I would order both of those again anytime.  Delicious!

My husband ordered the calzone and I thought, for almost 15 bucks, that better be one damn good calzone, and it was!  Absolutely excellent blending of flavors and it's huge.  It made for some great leftovers the next day.  The best item we ordered.  

Tim and I decided to order 2 pizzas to share and the pizza margherita disappeared in a hurry.  Simple, and perfectly done.  Now, the pizza rustica on the other hand was better as leftovers because it was underdone when it was brought to us.  I am familiar with the fork and knife style of pizza, but as I tried to take a slice of this one, the crust just kind of smeared across the pan and was almost gooey even though it was very thin.  The prosciutto was good quality, but because it was underdone as well, its flavors really didn't come alive.  An edge of crust was burnt, which is fine if the rest of the pizza is done, but the middle and the overall pizza was not completely finished.  

I warmed it up the next day in a hot oven on a stone, and then it still had that chewy crust consistency, but the great flavor of the prosciutto was there.  The arugula was wonderful.  Fresh and peppery as it should be.  They were extremely busy, which was expected, and I think they took that one out of the oven just a minute or two too soon.  No complaints, but it was noticeable that it was undercooked.  I am a big fan of leftovers so it was not a big deal.  

Jessica took good care of us and we had a great time.  I would most definitely make a return trip to Cibo."}
{"text":"This place is a must try out place.  The atmosphere is so laid back and the pizzas are absolutely delicious. The pizza taste so good.  Also the crepe's are so delicious, I had the fresca. It is full of fruits and vanilla ice cream.   I will definitely be back soon, very soon I reallt liked these place.  The staff was very nice and it felt very welcoming."}
{"text":"We were in town for a convention, arriving Thursday night and looking for a comfortable dining venue.  Cibo delivered.  Service began slow, which my wife and I don't mind because we actually enjoy a less rushed meal.  The owner saw things getting backed up, and helped get our salad order expedited to our table.  The pizzas and wine were great, and the outdoor patio was unique and cozy on a cool April evening.  We enjoyed it so much we dined there again Saturday night.  This time we sat in a cozy corner and enjoyed another delicious pizza.  The owners are very nice.  We spoke to them during brief wait for our table.  Highly recommend the food, the atmosphere, and the service."}
{"text":"This is a really nice little place located in downtown Phoenix. Parking is quite good in their private lot,but if it is full you can always park on the street around the neighborhood.
It is a house that has been changed to a lovely little eatery.
They have designed it very nicely, so it flows but, it is also private. We have been here for Brunch only.  But, the food was very good and the coffee nice and smooth. They even have raw sugar(my favourte.) 

 This place is for sure worth your time.
I would come back any time.    Prices are a little high, But that is the way it goes."}
{"text":"Great Pizza!  Great Ambiance!  4 stars for service.  They are busy and popular causing them to be understaffed when I am there.  I think they are ready for a larger bar with more than 1 guy.  

I felt like a bad guy as I crowded up to the bar and waited only 3-4 minutes to get the bar tender to get me a beer.  He was polite.  It is just that he was filling orders for the whole place.  

To the owners of Cibo.  Build a 2nd bar for your busy nights, to make easy for your clients to get a drink.  I would have order a 2nd beer if didn't have to wait in that line....maybe an outdoor bar that is only stocked for your busy nights."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give Cibo 5 stars from the minute we drove by and saw the place. The delicious smells, the live music, the twinkly little lights draped all around the yard...I just knew it was going to be wonderful. 

We were quoted 20 min for a party of two for first available, but I read on yelp to expect that to be off -and it was...closer to 40 minutes- but it was a nice evening, and I was mentally exhausted from the long drive from Las Vegas, so I didn't mind that. 

We are seated and I was excited we wound up with a nice patio seat. Our server brought us some menus and when we ordered water she sort of rolled her eyes at us. I don't know how the serving situation works here - one young lady was handing water, wrapping silverware, and apparently picking up all the slack of the actual waitress. She brought us water, and about 15 min later, seeing we still had menus, kind of shook her head to herself and got the actual waitress. We ordered and she disappeared again, but the girl with water checked on us and brought us a little carafe. 

The people beside us had ordered dessert as we ordered our food, 1 dessert to share. The people from the kitchen ended up coming to ask what they had ordered. Our food showed up, and it was really good. We got a quattro formaggi and the pizza with speck, Asian pears and goat cheese. We finished and waited for the bill, and then waited to pay. Finally ready to leave, we realized we needed to break a $20 for the valet. I walked back inside, (where by the way wait staff runs past you each time you walk in the door and makes you feel tremendously in their way) and the host acted like I was really bothering him by asking such a menial question and said that he didn't have any change to give me and I should has asked my server, to which I almost replied \"I would, had I ever seen her for more than 2 seconds.\" (Like I said, almost told him that, I try to be friendly and polite though.) 

I walked back out and saw my server, asked her to break a 20, she said the valet should have change, then threw her head back laughing? I don't know, it was very odd. The nicest person i encountered here was definitely the young lady (I'm 31, so the younger-than-me lady) handling water and silverware. I hope she is getting a cut of the tips, and had I been able to get change before walking out to the car, I definitely would have slipped her some of it. 

Those poor people beside us might still be waiting for their Fresca, whipped cream on the side. 

Ambiance: 5 stars
Food: 4 stars
Service: 2 stars"}
{"text":"First off I'd like to say it has great customer service. I walked up and was greeted no more than a minute of waiting. They have live music on the patio outside which is a great addition to the vibe it displays, however I decided to sit inside which wasn't pleasant at all due to the lack of fans inside. The food wasn't what I expected it to be, even though I enjoyed the pesto. I don't recommend this place to others but if you wind up here it wouldn't be the end of the word being that they did offer great service when it came to offering opinions and being  on top of me and my family. Also if you come here and want a last minute drink, order the limoncello. Hope this is helpful as this is my first time coming to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, perfect for a date night. Can't go wrong with their pizza and save room for dessert: their sweets menu is exceptional!"}
{"text":"Okay so Cibo's is really good, let's get that out of the way right up front.  Their salads with pine nut goodness, their sandwiches with the bread that holds up no matter the insides, the iced tea.  Oh good lord almighty that tea is great.  So yeah, after two lunches at Cibo with Jesse, I am definitely sold on the joint.  BUT that is not to say that Cibo is flawless.  Let us proceed...

Jesse was having a crazy busy day, and I was bored.  We decided to lunch early and headed over to Cibo, since Jesse had been craving it.  We arrive in the neighborhood north of Van Buren where the quaint little sandwich/pizza house is located, and immediately I note the line of cars up and down one street, along with the line of tractors ripping up the intersecting one.  There at the corner lies her beloved eatery, with many chin-up suits and aging re-debutantes making their way towards it from all directions.  Jesse, sensing the parking challenge that was soon to present itself, slammed the brakes.  \"Go get us a table.\"

I'm out of the car like a greased-up salamander out of a Mexican Coke bottle.   Scuttling across the street to get ahead of all the winners, I'm considering my seating preference.  It's a little warm out, but all the shade trees in Cibo's courtyard would fix that right up.  Then I remembered the close quarters the last time we sat outside, not to mention Jesse's disgust at being seated next to a table with *GASP* a child.

I didn't know what things were like inside, but it hardly mattered.  My mind was made up, and when the hostess showed me to our window table in the small dining room near the bar, I realized it didn't matter at all.  The whole place was close quarters, except now we were gonna be inside, which meant way better acoustics!  Full tables all around.  This place is way above the radar and has been for some time, so this was to be expected.  What I didn't expect was the high-haired doughy woman in the electric lime muumuu sitting directly in my line of vision.  She ultimately heightened my experience a great deal just by showing up, although I couldn't help wondering which tribal casino was calling all the hospitals, looking for their most loyal customer.

Jesse ended up ordering the caprese sandwich with added prosciutto (server was happy to oblige), and I had the BBQ pulled pork.  Jesse's sandwich was pretty good.  My sandwich was MAGNIFICENT.  The spice was a pleasant surprise, and also gave me a bit of good old-fashioned sweat-face.  I wasn't really feeling the couple of flies buzzing around us during our chewing time, but to be fair I didn't know who they belonged to, so I can't in good faith pin it completely on the establishment.  Also, the server seemed to forget we were there a couple of times, which is always fun.  But hey, I'm sure the Carries outside needed their lemon water refills real bad, having just played their freckle-tanned backs off in the breast cancer tennis match they just came from.

It may seem from my review that I didn't have the best time.  This absolutely IS NOT the case.  I don't think lunch at Cibo could have gone any better.  The cramped eating space, outspoken clientele, somewhat negligent wait staff, all these should be, well, kind of expected when partaking of a place like Cibo.  It's almost like dinner theater - get in, get settled and get ready for the show.  And whenever possible, watch for muumuus."}
{"text":"Cibo is a great little spot down town for lunch.  The seating can be tight.  It is friendly, clean and easy to park at.  The menu is not the usual - so don't take a meat and potatos person there.  The salads are wonderful and my favorite is the Nutella crepe!"}
{"text":"Nice vibe. We had a corner table. Dimly lit room. 
Took a while to get service. But when did, nice peeps.
Yummy margarita pizza & amazing lemoncello."}
{"text":"I loved this place! Came for a little romantic dinner with my love right before enjoying the Suns basketball game. We had a wonderful walk to this place. It was a very romantic scenery. The view was lovely, the food was delicious. New great memories for him and I.  The pizza was jus wonderful very filling for the both of us. First thing I thought of was artichoke on pizza? Eh idk. But that was my fav! Definitely coming back for more. Thank you for the lovely staff and for the musician playing romantic songs during our dinner it was just lovely all the way around."}
{"text":"A few friends from the Owatonna, MN Class of 1963,  got together recently at Cibo for a mini reunion. We shared wine, pasta, LAUGHS and good memories under the twinkling lights of their outdoor patio. 

Cibo can accommodate groups from two to thirty-two with ease. Their talented one man band provides just the right ambiance.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!"}
{"text":"Cibo doesn't appear to need my review, since they have a lot of fans here and other places.  This is a good lunch spot if you can get there early enough to avoid a wait.  The patio is particularly nice when the weather permits.  I work about five blocks from here and I've only been there for lunch.  I've wanted to try dinner but something about coming all the way back downtown after I've driven home to Gilbert just doesn't appeal.  Maybe on a day off sometime.  The food is great.  I like the speck sandwich.  Speck, for the uninitiated, is just another kind of cured ham like prosciutto.  The bread is always perfectly toasted.  Currently they offer as sides a salad, fruit, or chips.  An orzo salad, a la Carly's, would be a nice addition."}
{"text":"One of my favorite things to do in Phoenix is to sit on Cibo's patio in the evening. There's just something enchanting about it. I've been there just under ten times, and for the majority of those, my service was friendly and attentive. The caprese was probably the best I'd had anywhere, with grape tomatoes rather than the usual romas, and just so much deliciousness. The pizza is good, as well. I wasn't hugely impressed by an omelette I had the first time I visited, nor the service that time, but I sometimes encounter that when I dine alone and the service has been good since. I was also impressed with some of their other salads. All-in-all, not much beats sharing a caprese and a pizza on a Friday night, listening to live music, enjoying the faerie lights and a good glass of wine under the stars."}
{"text":"Place was good overall. The pizza was pretty authentic and the appetizers were good. Definitely try the meatballs at happy hour, they are huge and very reasonably priced. My one gripe was the mediocre service. Staff stood around talking and didn't do much. Other than that it was good."}
{"text":"Incredible pizza, incredible service and ambiance. Everything there is good, even the anchovy pizza  I'm hoping to go back another time for dessert :)"}
{"text":"amaze.ing.

why are all the good pizza places in cenpho? whatevs. 
i had the spicy sausage pizza and oh my gosh, YUM!!!! 
my friend had the margherita- also yum. love the whole leaves of fresh basil

and for the climax.....the nutella crepe with strawberries. OOOOOOH my gosh. 

i love you cibo."}
{"text":"We did not love it, but we did enjoy our experience here. We were in and out within an hour, went for happy hour (3pm-5pm). We parked in the private pay lot right next to the restaurant and for an hour it was only $3.  We walked in through the busy patio which was very well done, super cute. We chose to eat inside - nice interior also and we were seated right away. The pizzas were on special for $5 with a choice of about 6 varieties to choose from. We had a ham and pineapple and the mushroom and cheese. By far the tangy red sauce on the Hawaiian just made it better than the mushroom one (no red sauce so it was quite bland but totally edible). Loved the crust on these pizzas. We decided we liked this pizza far better than Pucinella's and Unas. On par we would say, with Famoso. There was love put into making these thin crust zas and the price could not be beat. We got 2 and were allowed to take the leftovers home. You can ask for chili oil too and it was for sure oily but in no way spicy, sadly.
Beer was on sale for $4 and red or white for $5 a glass. I tried the red and it was not bad at all. Italian of course!
Service was not as good as the food. It is very casual, some would say not so professional but we have had way worse.
One thing I would change is if you are going to give out the same paper menus over and over to people (they were so dirty), maybe laminate them! Would make a huge diff.
3 drinks, 2 pizzas, generous tip, under $30.
Oh and I liked that they served you tap water at your table and should you choose to order sparkling or still water, you can ask and THEN have that added to your bill and not the other way around like some other eateries."}
{"text":"My husband and I held an event in the Cibo carriage house last night. I cannot say enough how great it was. The carriage house looked great, the food was awesome, and Nicole and the rest of the staff could not have been more amazing! Planning the event was completely stress free, and everything went off without a hitch. Even our guests commented on how nice everything was. We are beyond pleased with our experience, and will definitely be back for the food!"}
{"text":"they use nutella wich has many grams of partially hydrogenated oil!!!!!!!

They do not use any of this nasty oil in the pizza. I got a cheese pizza and it was pretty good, I would go back for sure, just not eat the dessert. The vibe was cool and laid back. Good place to meet with friends"}
{"text":"Mushroom pizza is the best. Pineapple pizza was also good. Pear pizza was not great - was very bare when it came to toppings and
tasted like a dessert pizza. Today, the pizza crust wasn't great. It was very thick in some parts."}
{"text":"I've had 2 great experiences with CIBO, and 2 that left me cold. 

Pros: Great pizza, delectable crust, ambiance, cordial service, great wine, bustlingly quaint & neighborhood-y.

Cons: When CIBO gets overwhelmed, which is often, the service and product diminish steadily and predictably. Last visit, my order came out within 5 minutes of placing it and I got low-pitched food illness thereafter. 

I want to love you, CIBO, because when you are good, you are oh so good."}
{"text":"Absolute best pizza in AZ. No competition.  Cannot say enough about this establishment, from the staff on, it is fantastic."}
{"text":"Had the mussel appetizer, wild boar pizza, and ravioli entree split with a friend. Interior decor very well put together - 2 floors, lots of seating! We sat on the patio though and had a very pleasant, friendly server. Food came promptly, very delicious. Overall solid choice for Italian on 17th ave. The only thing that took away from the 5 stars would just be the price - Its always about the optimal taste to price ratio, not quite to a 5 star."}
{"text":"First of all, I've been a Yelp lurker for years... I had an experience tonight that compels me to write.  Felt in the mood for some Cibo pizza on my home to SoPho from a downtown Phoenix client ... was guided by the awesome female bartender towards the Diavlo pizza with added ricotta (something different from my standby Margarita pizza ... she didn't steer me wrong).  As I tend to do ... stopped by on my way home with novel in hand, ordered a dry white and a pizza to go.  The serene hum of this sweet little place was broken up by a nice older, very clean, but obviously mentally challenged man.  He walked in and loudly asked what was on the menu ... wanted a loaded pizza and a beer in this upscale downtown restaurant.  The owner gave him his utmost attention and ordered him the pizza with his toppings of choice, and a beer. I'm sorry I didn't get the owner's name, but his attentiveness and kindness endeared me even more to this place.  This diverse downtown environment may scare some away ... but I just love the energy of people helping people.  Oh, and the pizza at this place is to die for!  Can't wait to try Pasta Tuesdays and Wednesdays, which I just learned about while I was waiting."}
{"text":"I think all that can be said has been said about this awesome place! I can't wait to go back! Funghi pizza (Tomato sauce, mushrooms, and mozzarella) we added sausage, and arugula! It was so perfect! The wood fired gluten free crust was devine. Everything you want in a wood fired pizza. Our friends let us try some of their house salad. That was also perfection. With its grape tomatoes, pin nuts, red, peppers, onions and more with balsamic and mixed greens. For dessert we had the Crepes filled with marsclpon, blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries, sprinkled with powdered sugar! So yummy. To top it all off we had a nice Cappuccino, so foamy and warm! I think I had already fallen in love the second we turned the corner and all you could see was this beautiful place draped with lights and vines. As you walk up through the beautiful patio setting there were misters and a live band playing. Then the waitress took us through the little maze of what use to be a house to our cozy little table. I don't have one bad thing to say! I will be back very soon to try some pasta and wine! I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Not really necessary to add to the compliments but why not if they deserve it. Food was phenomenal. Really. It was. Best pizza I had in a long time (ever?), and my husband shared that sentiment. Grilled veggie appetizer was very good too. Next day we went back (not our M.O. in a city where we only have 2 days) and got pizza and desert, crepes. Hmmm. Only complaint we had is the first day, the service was really rushed. Girl wanted to take our plate while there was still some olives on it, and when she brought us the check, while she was thanking us she was already turned away to the next table. A few extra seconds go a long way here, I'd say. Also, they \"switched out\"  some beers without telling us when we ordered, which I didn't like. Service next day was better and all in all, I'd very much recommend the place!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I'd been here and what a night to come.  Pasta night!  Got a delicious gnocchi with shrimp along with a great merlot wine pairing to boot.  The outdoor patio had great relaxing live music and the weather outside is perfect.  As stated in my La Piazza Locale review, this isn't my favorite pizza in town (that title belongs to Pomo).  However, in terms of ambience and atmosphere, you'd be hard pressed to beat the charm of this beautiful bungalow and the gorgeous patio outside."}
{"text":"Love Cibo. The wife and I have been here several times and it never dissapoints. I love their Pizza. It is up there with all of the best pizza places including Pizzeria Bianco. My wife loves their meatballs, and the sauce that comes with it is terrific. I had a crepe (suzette) for desert and I really enjoyed it. We go there regularly and the service and atmosphere is always top-notch."}
{"text":"The best pizza in phoenix. The food and atmosphere is great. Very romantic at nights for your first date trust me. And the desserts will have you wanting more at this place. Try the diavola."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Like many of you, I am a sucker for charming little homes that have been re-purposed into restaurants. I am certain that this colored my opinion of Cibo.

That being said, I absolutely love having lunch here the other day. I unknowingly arrived at 2:05 (5 minutes after they close between lunch and dinner) but was served anyway. I had the salscicia sandwich and a side of fruit. The sandwich was excellent, served on perfectly crisp, chewy saltimbocca bread. The sausage was flavorful and was complimented by roasted red peppers and onions. All this was finished off with a great quality mozzarella cheese. Really, really delicious.

I should also say that the atmosphere here was friendly and  comfortable, though a bit small. This would be a great place to hang out if you lived nearby."}
{"text":"With all the rave reviews this place gets, I had been wanting to try it for ages.  \"As good as Bianco!\" everybody says.  My first impression upon seeing the place was very good; for as busy as it was, it still felt small and intimate.  The 30 minute wait wasn't terrible considering the crowd, and after that, we were seated in a small corner of the house with only a few other tables in view.

When we arrived, the table on one side of us was empty, and the table on the other side had a family with a screaming baby just finishing up their meal.

When the waitress arrived, she took our orders.  I went with the marinara and a bottle of root beer.  The root beer came back barely chilled with a glass of ice.  First mistake.  Bottled soda should be served cold.  Pouring warm soda into ice leaves you with watered down soda.

At some point, someone at the table noted that we should have ordered appetizers because our food was taking so long.  Both of the other tables had received new parties, and their pizzas.  The waitress returned to apologize for our pizzas taking so long, but we must understand, there is a very large party they are serving outside.  Now, I don't like to get too philosophical when reviewing restaurants, but if the reason for the delay is a large party, why do the two tables, who were seated 5-10 minutes after us, already have their pizzas?

Eventually, of course, we received pizzas.   I noticed right away that all of the toppings could be found in a small region near one side of the pie, while entire slices contained nothing but sauce.  Clearly this was hastily assembled; no problem, I just took a few seconds to spread out the toppings.  Certainly the kitchen could have taken a little more care with my pizza.

As it turned out, the pizza was underwhelming.  It was a fine pie to be sure, but there are much better artisan pies in the valley.  If you are going to wait, you might as well go to Bianco.  If you want a crowded environment, go to Pomo.  Those places also have their issues, but they have better pizza.

Unfortunately, despite all the hype this place gets, I left with the realization that there's really no reason to come back."}
{"text":"NEVER a complaint about the food or ambiance.  As far as a great meal and great atmosphere are concerned, this is the best place in Phoenix.  The only reason for the 3 stars is the hit-or-miss service.  Sometimes you get the best service you've ever had and sometimes you think your waiter forgot you sat down 30 minutes ago.  I want to give 5 stars, but I just can't."}
{"text":"LOVE Cibo!! Go there every chance I get..HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"Cibo has a really cool patio area - neat to sit outside.  We had a table near the entry walk - as the crowd built up, some of the people waiting to be seated were kind of crowding our space (I had the seat closest to the walkway).  Other than that, nice environment.  (Be prepared to walk upon arrival - we had to park a couple of blocks away - nice evening, so no worries!)

We came because I was told Cibo had the best gluten-free pizza crust.  (I tasted it, and it tasted very much like the not-gluten-free crust - not at all cracker-like as most places seem to have).

This is one of those upscale wood-fired places that has pizzas with all kinds of things you may not associate with pizza toppings (e.g. prosciutto crudo, capers, artichokes).  That's great for some folks, but when you've got a teenager with coeliac, it would be great to have simple pepperoni as an option. 

I went with the aforementioned prosciutto crudo topping for my pie.  It's added after the pizza is cooked (makes perfect sense).  However, it's also added after the pizza is cut, so you have to cut/tear the prosciutto to fit the slices (doesn't make perfect sense).  My pizza didn't have a terrific 'upskirt' and the gumline on the crust was pretty high - I think they rushed it a bit.  My wife's crust had better leopard-spotting.

It was nice that they had crepes available for dessert, and that gluten-free crepes were available!  The crepes were a nice finish.

My iced tea only got refilled once (turned out to be a blessing, as it's a longish drive home).

Also, great 'hipster watching', if that amuses you.

I'm going to lump Cibo into the same category as Pizzeria Bianco - if that floats your boat, this probably will too.  

As for me?  Not my thing... overrated/overpriced."}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix for a few conferences and stopped in here for lunch. We started off with an order of arancini. We loved the arancini--straight up cheese and rice. It's the best we've tried so far. We order the margherita, salsiccia, and diavola pizzas to share. Each of us liked a different pizza the best. 

I wish we had had time to go for dinner instead. The dinner menu is more extensive and along the lines of what Italian food I like. They also serve cacio e pepe, which I've had difficulty finding outside of Rome. Overall, however, we enjoyed our meal and would consider going again if in the area again."}
{"text":"We went yesterday. I think our tab ended up being around $27. We shared a pizza, beer and desert. The atmosphere was awesome, the neighborhood was sketchy, the food was incredible and the customer service was great. We would go again. The tiramisu was killer and their white pizzas were better than their reds."}
{"text":"I came here a few months ago and the atmosphere is fantastic! My girlfriend loved it. The pizza is very pricy but very authentic. We liked it... I do not remember the name of the pizza but it had truffle sauce and mushrooms on it... WOW. I definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Diavola. I'm pretty sure this was the best pizza I've ever had in my life. I was not expecting to think that while shoving hot slivers of flavorful dough, just enough mozz, and spicy pepperoni while just trying to catch a bite on my road trip up to Page. The Capri salad was also refreshing with pesto dressing and pine nuts. Super fantastic place. The outdoor seating looks quite heavenly as well."}
{"text":"After studying abroad in Italy, I was in search for a place that could bring back some of those yummy and wonderful memories. This place is so warm, inviting and beautiful and absolutely reminds me of Italy. I had the Prosciutto Crudo Pizza and was in heaven! If you go at night and it is good weather out, I suggest you sit outside. It completes the whole \"Italian experience\"."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, fast and friendly service and good place for adult or family time. My 7 year old loved the pizza, he says it's his favorite."}
{"text":"Cibo is one of those places that doesn't have the most amazing food, yet you keep coming back because it's always a beautiful experience nonetheless. The service is always top notch, and the wonderful owners are always within sight. The whole restaurant is gorgeous of course, with the overhead lights and plants in the outside patio and the vintage, house-turned-restaurant on the inside. As previously mentioned, the food isn't amazing but it will do. The pizza is tasty but not the best. I remember the burrata and the caprese salad being pretty good. The nutella crepe was delicious.

Over all, I would definitely keep coming back to Cibo because of the perfect ambiance. Whether it would be a date, a birthday dinner or an intimate meal with your family, Cibo is the perfect place to be."}
{"text":"Cibo seems to suffer from bipolar disorder. We have enjoyed several meals on our own at the bar and with friends at a table or outside for the live jazz. Cibo has all the right stuff but it lacks consistency. One of our visits will be nearly perfect with great customer service, good food and a decent wine selection. The next time we take friends for the first time, the service is lousy, the food is average and the wine doesn't make up for it.

I feel in general it's a cool spot to hang out but for the service and food quality it is overpriced. Some time ago we happened to be there on pasta night. Apparently the chef makes all of the pasta from scratch which is cool but because it is labor intensive, they rarely have it as a special. If you get the chance to enjoy their house-made lasagna...don't delay, it is worth every penny! 

Check it out but be prepared to park and walk since parking is scarce and it can get pretty crowded especially on Friday & Saturday nights."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here 4 times.  In the winter, we try to seek warm places, and AZ has moved to the top of our list.  Cibo as become a 2nd home for us when we are in town!  We love sitting on the outside patio and listening to the live music.  The pizza is also top notch and the salad is literally bigger than our heads!  Love this place."}
{"text":"This setting is gorgeous/ Old house, twinkly lights on the beautiful patio. There was a great three piece jazz band playing the Friday evening we visited/ They made it totally worth the visit. The food, however, was just meh. We had pasta. My husbands meat pasta was good. mine not so much. I agree the pastas are iffy, no matter the wait staffs recommendation.  I recall the pizza being pretty fab, and the crepes. Probably a better first date, college student hangout than great foodie locale, but very pretty and romantic."}
{"text":"Love pizza. Who doesn't? Cibo is probably my most favorite pizza place. The outdoor courtyard is fun and romantic. Their white truffle pizza, I mean you can't go wrong. The burrata is also amazing. They only serve wine so don't plan on any hard alcohol. The crepes are also great for a dessert. If you haven't gone, then I suggest you go!"}
{"text":"It's a cozy place! The food is Italian style, very tasty and well combined ingredients. The best is the service and not only that but the environment... If you go I recommend you to sit outside! It's plenty of trees, birds, beautiful area! I will go back!"}
{"text":"The crapes are amazing. Loved the rustica pizza! And the ice tea has a hint of orange. The outside terrace was beautifully lit. Id recommend this for sure."}
{"text":"One of my most favorite restaurants in Phoenix. Anything we ordered on the menu was delicious. Little expensive but well worth the experience."}
{"text":"I took my friend to Cibo for his birthday a couple of weeks ago. He had been before and I had not (so I guess he kinda took me). 

I ordered the Rustica Bianco Pizza and i believe he ordered the Diavola add basil. The food was delish however my Rustica had so much arugula on it it looked like a salad on top of my pizza. I'm talking a VERY unnecessary amount.... whatever, I just removed 3/4 of it. We had almost finished our first bottle of Pinot Noir before being seated so we had another along with dinner; it was a great compliment to the food. It was a Friday night and the wait wasn't more than 45 minutes, not bad in comparison to Bianco. All in all we had a quality experience. 
The bar seating is very \"close quarters\" and if you're like me and you don't like strangers sitting in your lap I recommend imbibing someplace else."}
{"text":"Another great experience at Cibo. Our party of four was seated right away, with an attentive (but by no means annoying) server. The food was great, as usual. If you're going with a group, do yourself a favor and check out the menus ahead of time if you're planning on sharing any of the pizzas. We would have been able to order much faster if we hadn't argued for so long over which of the pizzas to get. We ended up agreeing on the quattro... whatever is Italian for cheese probably - and the red pizza with sausage. The 4 cheese white pizza is delicious, but very rich. I'd probably get a lighter one to go with it next time. Their pizza with arugula and walnuts perhaps (La Noce maybe? I can't remember all the actual pizza names). 

On an interesting side note, a friend of mine chose to brave the line at Pizzeria Bianco last night, and wound up wishing he had gone to Cibo instead. Advantage Cibo!!"}
{"text":"I hear this place is dog friendly, didn't try it but can totally see this because the outdoor seating is awesome. Pizzas: Out if the Salsiccia (red sauce) and Quattro Formaggi, we enjoyed the latter. You can taste the individual cheeses and the flavs all blend together perfectly, add some fresh arugula and life is good! Very Gorgonzola-ey. Our server was okay, kind of not really friendly, but our orders were perfect. Would go back just for the Nutella crepes. Valet..at 830pm they tell us the lot is closed, even though there are spaces(?) then when we left at 945pm and valet is open and parking cars. I don't get it. Just street park!"}
{"text":"Cibo is just amazing as always! This time we wanted to celebrate a very special day with friends! Therefore, I got a reservation for 6 in their yard. We didn't have to wait at all for our table and the table was ready for us! Love their set up at nights and the music band on weekends! The lighting make the yard so pretty!
The restaurant was super busy that night and kitchen was backed up! We had to wait for our food for a while but with their great customer service and hospitality they offered 2 of our dishes to be on the house and our waiter apologized for the serving our dish later than expected so many times! I felt so bad because I could see how busy they were! It seemed like they have few big parties going on that night. But we enjoyed our food and the bottle of wine suggested from our waiter. And we will definitely go back aga"}
{"text":"First time here and definitely not the last.. We got a 3 course and of course shared it all. Haha we got a salad (I forgot the name) but it was almost like a Caesar but not quite and still to me even better!

The pizza we got was a Diavola? With added Italian sausage. The pizza was gone in minutes!. It was really good the salami had a small kick but a good kick. You can tell everything was fresh the taste was just so much better. The crust I loved it wasn't too crispy but just right.

Dessert we got a Nutella Crepe with Ice Cream. Omg! Love love this simple dessert! 

The only reason why no 4 stars I got a latte and that was no Bueno. And parking is all street parking. The waitress at first was a little rude but then that's her fault she didn't ask if we have been there before especially since we were asking amateur questions. Lol other than those will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"CIBO is a pizza restaurant in a quiet part of downtown Phoenix. With a range of vegetarian options that taste just fine, CIBO is a go-to spot in downtown Phoenix if you're looking to get out of the hotel but not venture too far into the desert.

CIBO feels like one big home. Well, that might be because the restaurant exterior looks like a home. My server was a bit quirky: he had jokes, but also had a knack for stopping by our table at the most inopportune times. He reminded me of the mom calling about the squirrels in the GEICO commercial. 

The food at CIBO is affordable: I paid $14 for a plate of pasta (linguine cacao e pepe) and $11 for a margherita pizza. I wouldn't recommend the pasta - it was as plain as a white t-shirt. The microgreens on top were a nice touch, but out of place. The pizza was tasty, but I avoided eating the crust.

I would return again if I were staying in downtown Phoenix, but the food wasn't particularly memorable. My strongest memory of CIBO was of the two people making out outside the restaurant as I was leaving. The food? Good enough, but not as memorable."}
{"text":"I'll try anything twice, that's always been my motto.

While the staff is very kind there is a hint of disdain.  Perhaps it was my \"Bearded for her pleasure\" shirt.  I actually enjoyed everything about this restaurant, except for the food, atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Went back lastnight for a birthday dinner. We decided on Cibo for convenience since we were going across the street for another reservation. 

Underwhelming is the only word that comes to mind. I ordered the rigatoni baked pasta with strip steak on top. It was flavorless, the sauce tasted like it came right out of a can, the steak was flavorless. We were confused by the amount of wine we were given for $14 a glass.  The per glass price didn't make sense with the average price of the bottle on the drink menu

We don't bother ordering desert. I'll never go back, even if I was paid too."}
{"text":"The gluten free pizza was the best I have ever had. It was thicker than most GF pizzas. It was also homemade. My husband liked his pizza but he likes thicker crust and it was too thin for him. We loved the atmosphere. The staff was also wonderful. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Prices were very fair and food was great. I heard about this cat that hangs around there, and as soon as we got there she greeted us. As we walked through the entrance, not sure of where to go, it was almost as if the cat was leading the way. We sat on the patio which was really nice. Mozzarella (that's what they call the cat) came and sat on my girlfriends daughter's lap. We hadn't ordered yet so it was ok. Then the cat left to the grass and allowed us to enjoy our meal."}
{"text":"I don't usually eat Italian, or pizza ... or give Italian or pizza places 5 stars. But this place really took me by surprise. 

WARNING: If you sit outside during mosquito season, prepare to be bitten!! Otherwise, it is probably one of the most ROMANTIC cute outdoor dining spots I've ever seen. Perfect for Phoenix since it's perpetually warm almost all the time during the summer, fall and spring months.

We came here because of the phenomenal reviews, and also because everyone said it was better than Biano. 

I have to say, their daily pasta specials are amazing because the pasta is homemade! I am a sucker for homemade pasta even though I don't like Italian food for the most part ... sooo delicious. The food comes out extremely fast! 

The pizza here is the thin style wood-fired oven kind, which is great, and their overuse of truffle oil is totally ok with me. I loved the truffle mushroom pizza, and we got ricotta on the Diavlo. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Met up with a good friend for Happy Hour here. I actually enjoy coming here by myself from time to time and people watch from the bar. There's always somethin' on their wine list to accommodate Love their pizzas and salads. A restaurant that knows how to tease me properly with Nutella as an ingredient will always receive high praise from me! Decor and setting is perfect for friends and family -- If wear permits and is ideal, I highly recommend dining out on their patio. Can't say anything negative about this place."}
{"text":"Cibo never disappoints.  My guest and I decided to sit outside.  We had just missed the sprinkle of rain and felt safe under one of their umbrellas.  There was a hint of coolness in the air.  It was a great night.  Cibo's front yard/ patio is a charming spot.  Every time I eat at Cibo it has been on their patio.  I have yet to see the interior.  To start, we shared the House salad.  The greens were fresh, the cheese was awesome, and the dressing was excellent.  It served two people perfectly.  Next, we ordered the Veggie pizza.  It was delicious.  The crust is in between thin and doughy.  I like Cibo's crust, its the best of both worlds.  The veggies were fresh and the sauce was wonderful.  Our bill was around 20 bucks.  Cibo's delivers great quality for the price tag."}
{"text":"Cibo is an incredible spot! Delectable food and an incredible atmosphere. I'd recommend getting reservations for outdoor seating if you can - the ambiance is romantic and beautiful. We've tried their pizzas, pastas, salads, crepes and more and nothing has disappointed yet. 

If you're gluten-free this place is for you as well - they offer gluten-free pizza and crepes which are out of this world delicious!"}
{"text":"Whaaaat!! We left Boston and found a restaurant that if we could pick it up with a helicopter we could drop if into the North End and it would be like the bar scene in Star Wars where it was business as usual. Waiting on a crepe so.... Got to go... Put this on your bucket list.  Go Pats!!!!'
The Caprese salad and the Spinache sandwich are amazing!!  The service was amazing too!!  You have to order a crepe!!"}
{"text":"this place was right at the corner along a row of residental area...it looked homey actually, like eating in a house.  
came here for dinner saturday night...it was packed!! ambiance was quite good and they had a tiny bar.

got vegetarian pizza...just love zucchini and artichokes on pizza! crust was good-chewy, rustic, thin- but some parts were a bit too burnt for me.  wouldve enjoyed a bit more veges on my pizza.....

will def come back for pizza!"}
{"text":"I've been to Cibo twice in the last month and both times it was awesome. Thanks to Erica, who served me twice and made my experience there as a vegan just perfect. (And to the chefs who accommodate me!)"}
{"text":"Long time reader of Cibo reviews, first time diner and now writer.  Our group of 4 headed there Saturday night, and were immediately charmed by the atmosphere with the cute patio seating and white lights.  We arrived at 7ish and got a drink at the bar (a plus - Nimbus beer from Tucson!  And a $5 glass of Pinot Grigio!)  before being seated outside in about 20 minutes.  

Our waiter was super friendly and helpful, suggesting the indecisive BF order half Prosciutto Crudo and half Salsiccia.  The rest of us ordered the Margherita - I know, I know, original.  More points to the waiter, who didn't look at my friend like a weirdo when she ordered her Margherita sans the cheese. Also, there was one woman who seemed assigned to water distribution only, and was on top of refilling our glasses.  And for me, that was every 5 minutes.  

We started with the Caprese Salad, which was different but oh so delicious.  The cherry tomatoes were soaked in the pesto, oregano, and olive oil and were very flavorful - great with the mozzarella.  I could've used more basil leaves or arugula, but whatev.   The pizza's were mmmmm, mmmmm good but didn't blow me away.  Again, I could've used more basil leaves, but my fellow margherita eaters took theirs off, so again, personal preference.  

I would definitely return for the overall ambience and uniqueness of Cibo, as well as the friendly staff and owners.  Definitely a downtown treat!!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and found Cibo using yelp- not only was the food AMAZING but the service was great. I would defiantly recommend stopping by and grabbing a pizza!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Love the cute place.  We tried salad, a couple appetizers, pizza, daily special and dessert.  Very tasty, a full of flavor...simply Delicious!   Cibo became one of my top \"must-go once a while\" places! My kids also enjoyed their food  and live music.  Outside seating will be very cozy in a couple months! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Showed up with a party of 10 and no reservations.  The staff worked hard to accommodate us quickly on their lovely patio.  Music and lights on the patio were wonderful as were all of our food choices including the dessert crepes.  Friendly staff,wonderful atmosphere, great food!"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch! Loved the flat bread and has great service. It was easy to get a table as well. 

The only thing was that they didn't have a change table in the washroom and our friends with a baby were a little inconvenienced."}
{"text":"Its official - my favorite pizza place in Phoenix!  Sometimes it can use a little more cheese, but overall I consistently like all the pizzas I've tried.  Salads are pretty good as well.  Even with the price tag I will return time and again.  Also the fresca crepe dessert is a must try!"}
{"text":"We love the outdoor patio and the wonderful wood-fired pizzas at Cibo. My son was coming in from California and he had his little pup with him, so we needed a place to eat that was dog friendly. This place was great. We got in at closing time, and they still made us three pies, and provided a water dish for the pup. We had a great time, and the bill was reasonable and the pizza was outstanding. We'll go back. I deducted one star only because I had trouble finding the place in the beginning. It's worth taking the time, however!"}
{"text":"I have not tasted food so authentically Italian since I left Italy. I was blown away by the menu and the fresh ingredients. Our salad and pizza was simple, fresh, and real! Well done on this shining star to our dining map here in Phoenix!  Bravo!!!"}
{"text":"Love my pizza and am a fan of this place.  Great outdoor seating if the weather is right.  We always share a couple appetizers and a couple pies.  Cant really go wrong with anything that you choose."}
{"text":"2 words--not impressed. 

I called ahead to see if we could make a reservation for our party of 3 as we had show tickets and was informed that they do not take reservations for parties smaller than 8. I was assured however that we should have NO PROBLEM being seated promptly at 6PM on a Saturday evening. Our show was at 8PM so I figured a 2 hour window should have been ample. It's just pizza--how hard can it be? Boy was I wrong.

Well guess what? The restaurant was P.A.C.K.E.D. We waited 20 minutes to be seated which wasn't too bad for a Saturday evening at a popular spot but when the expectation was already set that it \"wouldn't be a problem\" to get seated, it was annoying.  The hostesses were friendly and pleasant tho so it was hard to be outwardly annoyed. 

We were finally seated inside and proceeded to wait some more for a server to come by and take our drink order. 10 minutes passed when I flagged down a busser to ask if we could get someone to take our drink order. A few short minutes later, our server arrived and so it began...the glare. The \"can't you see I'm very busy and you'll just have to wait\" glare. Sigh. Because we were seated in a smaller room, it was very noisy and our server REFUSED to speak louder to share with us the beers they had available. We aren't deaf...it was just loud. She wouldn't move closer to the person asking, she wouldn't speak louder, nothing. And then she walked away...and 10 minutes later, she passed by to inform us that the bartender was backed up and it would be a few more minutes but didn't stop long enough to take our appetizer or dinner order. Fortunately, the busser was VERY on top of keeping our water filled so at least we had SOMETHING to drink. Drinks finally came out and we had to ask her to take our appetizer order. Again the \"can't you see I'm busy\" glare. It was 30 minutes after seating that our appetizer finally came. We ordered the Burrata which is fresh mozzarella with proscuitto and toast. Although the mozzarella and proscuitto were delicious, the toast was burnt...visibly burnt. I'm not even sure why she put it in front of us that's how burnt it was. But, we couldn't send it back because no one ever came by to check on us. 

More time passes and everyone in the room has received their appetizers, entrees, and have moved on to dessert except for us. We are still waiting for our entrees and are watching the clock. At 7:20, I flagged down our server who gave me the glare again to ask her if our pizzas were coming out soon as we had show tickets. Instead of \"I'm so sorry for the wait, let me check on that for you\" I received the \"I'd call you a bitch if I wouldn't get fired for it\" glare and this time the glare was accompanied by a lecture that there was a party in the Carriage House. I had NO idea what the Carriage House was or why a party there had any effect on our meals but our server had already huffed off before I could ask. So we googled. Turns out Carriage House is part of Cibo where they serve large parties. Good to know...would have been better to know back when we were getting seated about these delays but so be it. Our pizzas arrived at the table at 7:30 PM. We have now been at Cibo for 90 minutes. Our show was at Comerica and was starting at 8PM. We scarfed down that pizza as fast as we could and Ms. Glare left us the check at least when she dropped our pizzas. 

After all that waiting, rudeness, and more waiting, honestly? I've had better pizza at Picazzos. This pizza was thin looking but was doughy. The sausage on the Salsiccia was sparse at best. The Rustica wasn't cut properly so we were fighting with the proscuttio. Both were just ok. It was really very anti-climatic. 

Cibo was a major disappointment. Considering all the rave reviews here on Yelp, I am that much more disappointed that our experience was so dismal. I wish I could tell you our server's name. If she said it, we sure didn't hear her and I'm pretty sure she didn't say it. There are lots of other options downtown. You might consider not going to Cibo unless you go with a larger party because apparently that's the only way to get good service and properly prepared food."}
{"text":"I was driving through Phoenix and stopped here for a pizza. The pizza was amazing and the staff was extremely friendly. I went there alone and ate at the bar, but I'd highly recommend this place for a date as it had a very romantic-type setting."}
{"text":"Absolutley LOVE THIS PLACE!
Great atmosphere, fun & trendy artwork but most importantly, clean place with good service and an exquisite gluten free pizza option that will blow your GF mind!

Will be back every time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Cibo offers modern Italian cuisine, with a large portion of their menu being tapas style. Now, because tapas has become quite popular in Calgary, I do have some expectations about price and quality. No problems with the quality, but I did find the price rather high. The portions are very small, some awkwardly-so for four people (mushrooms, for example).  If you plan on bringing your wallet, and take advantage of order a specific number of dishes in each category for a slight discount, it can be relatively reasonable. But again, I am comparing it to some other places that have this type of cuisine in Calgary.

I found said mushroom plate to be far too greasy, but that might be personal preference. On the other hand, while the gnocci was well crafted, I found it, too, to be fairly greasy.  The wild boar pizza was everything it was cracked up to be and was excellent. However generally, the pizza is fairly run of the mill, and does not quite stack up to its more focused counterparts such as Without Papers or Una. The desserts were interesting, but quite expensive for what you got. A Nutella calzone is certainly not novel, but was at least reasonably priced at $7.

Presentation was off-the-charts. Gorgeous plates all around. Service was beyond good. We went on Good Friday, and it was absolutely crazy in there. Our server was prompt, composed, and very friendly. She had forgot about a beer (for about 10 minutes), and I honestly wasn't concerned whatsoever. But without asking, she brought me one on the house. That's a sentiment that has become rather uncommon in Calgary and was very much appreciated. She was also very patient as the four of us deliberated over menu items. I'm sure this happens a lot given the wide selection of options.

If you enjoyed Cibo, also check out Candela!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite eateries in downtown Phoenix. The food is always fresh and plentiful. Their home made limoncello and chocolate liquor is dangerously delicious. Recently they started offering free valet service which is helpful because it can be a bit challenging to find parking."}
{"text":"We came to Cibo last evening, before heading over to the Herberger to see \"Man of La Mancha\", aka a takeoff of Cervantes' Don Quixote. 

Cabo is located in a former dutch colonial residence on W Fillmore near The Vig.  It's a fun and inviting setup that can be both romantic and classy in a bohemian sort of way.  Got it?

We arrived around five-thirty and Cibo was busy, but not crowded. I would certainly recommend the Yelp App to determine what the wait time is if you arrive after seven. When we left two hours later, there was a dozen waiting to be seated. 

We started off with some Italian Red wine, Rosso Poggione ($13) and a House Salad ($5). Both were tasty and complemented each other. For our Entr√©es, we chose the Fra Diablo pizza ($14), with a few dollops of ricotta (for two extra dollars) and the Pappardelle ($15) pasta with a Bolognese sauce. 

Both were clearly different, but outstanding.  The pizza had a nice kick, but wasn't a fire breather and didn't overwhelm your taste buds. My favorite was the pasta. The Bolognese was meaty and had nice layer of flavor. See photos. 

Our tab, ran us a reasonable $61 before gratuities and taxes. Our server Cubana was friendly and on top of things, even though she was simultaneously handling a table of sixteen. Nice. 

After seventeen hundred Yelp Reviews, you can see and read why everyone loves Cibo. We do, too. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Pizza is as good as you find in Rome if not better and you don't have to pay $1600 to get there.  We ordered the gorge house salad, meatballs and pizza Diavola for one hungry preteen and one adult. We didn't finish the pizza but loved  every bite. Attention to detail is noticeable. The base of marinara sauce and the toasted accompanying bread were  just as good as the meatballs. House salad had a nice balance. The pizza crust would bring me back by itself; The Neapolitan pizza reminded us of Rome, but had even better  ingredients!"}
{"text":"I do not know what all the fuss is about.  I found the food to be okay, if small, and the service to be rather indifferent."}
{"text":"We tried the Aracini, which is a fried rice ball with mozzarella cheese at the center. Good texture: crunchy outside, soft inside. When you chew it, you can feel the beautiful aroma of mozzarella cheese too. The Nuttela and Mascarpone crepe is fine, it has good crepe itself but I couldn't really feel the mascarpone in the middle."}
{"text":"You mainly come to Cibo for the pizza which I personally feel is arguably better than pizzaria bianco without it even really being their main specialty, it's just what people know this place for! I split a pizza and a pasta with a date and had the calamari appetizer. 

The appetizer was not that impressive to be honest. It was steaks of calamari about 2 fingers width fried up. The batter itself was good but I think if you're an Italian place you should have calamari that's rings and tentacles. 

Their pizza here is incredible. It's about a 12 inch serving good for and appetizer or splitting along with another entree. The pizza is thin crust that's dough while also maintaining a thin and crispy feeling. Pretty much perfect brick oven pizza. 

Their pastas are extremely well done and the server said their pasta is all made in house which you can truly taste. 

The wait staff here is incredibly friend and nice, the atmosphere is very cozy and intimate though you can definitely bring a larger group if your heart so desires.  

Parking is extremely easy with complimentary valet. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. I love to gather with friends and sit outside and enjoy their limoncello. This is a unique building with charm and character. They often have a musician playing outside. Their oven-brick-type of pizza is amazing! Simple and delishious menue that will make you want to come for more. Reservation is highly recommended if you plan to attend with a large group, especially afternoon."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends for lunch. What a treat!  The food was wonderful.  I had the Ai Spinaci, a sauted spinach, prosciutto & fontina sandwich.  A little slice of heaven.  My friends each had sandwiches (of which I can't remember) but they all liked them.

The parking is a little rough, as there are only 6-8 spots in the lot behind the restaurant (a converted house in mid-town), but there is street parking nearby.  I suggest going early, as it is popular.  And I can see why.

The staff was very nice, and we were seated right away on the patio.  Our glasses were always filled.

I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Birthdays beware they charge $2 per person if you bring your own cake. \"It's kinda like a wine decorking fee, but for cakes\" is how they described it. Good thing it caps out after $15. Pizza was great though. The atmosphere is relaxed with a nice patio set up."}
{"text":"Finally got to try the one of the most talked about pizzerias in Phoenix. The location was easy to spot but parking in the historical district was not on a Friday night. The entrance is covered by lush greens that wrap around throughout the corner lot. Our wait time was short at around 20 minutes and conveniently tracked this via the yelp app. We were seated inside in a small corner of the quirky home. Upon being seated, we were quickly greeted with iced water and menus. Although my companion and I found it a bit confusing that we received two different versions of the menu. We ordered two pies, Da Vinci and Funghi which came out in 15 minutes. The Da Vinci was okay, with a slight splash of red sauce, basil, romano, and burrata sitting on fluffy dough. The funghi, pronounced foon-ghee as we found out was less than okay. The red sauce pie had white mushrooms that were earthy and lacked flavor. This was a mozzarella melting pie that slides off the plate so you're only left with the bread upon the first bite while rests waits on your plate. The service was excellent as the staff was attentive in filling us with room temperature water and was quick to offer us the check, which was appreciated as the pies were disappointing. I can see the allure of the garden patio, as the low lights make for a great date."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite restaurants in PHx is @cibopizzeria - everything is homemade and the ambiance is homey and inviting. Great patio seating! I had the strozzapretti pasta with ricotta & sausage, so delicious! But their pizza is also fantastic! Try the homemade limoncello, it's served in a fancy little shot glass - it's a sipper"}
{"text":"Quaint pizza joint in historic downtown Phoenix. My family tells me this area has really picked up since I left in 2001, and now with the new lightrail, I believe them. Cibo has a lovely patio (perfect for spring/summer, but even w/ the heat lamps it would have been too cold), a cute tiny bar (not much room for waiting), and great thin crust pizza. I like the light feeling of the pizza, but I think it could be more flavorful. Still, for Phx, this place is pretty great. I recommend trying a couple pizzas and sharing. Also the pear salad is fantastic! I think I enjoyed it even more than the pizzas."}
{"text":"I can't believe it has taken me so long to eat at Cibo! This family owned restaurant offers a fabulous ambiance and delicious, authentic Italian food. We ordered several pizzas and we loved each one. The wine was on point and the service was fantastic! The location is within walking distance to several bars and music venues. I can't recommend this place enough. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Came here for double date night as my friend is gluten free. We waited at the bar for our table & I had their Bellini which was awesome, I loved the inside, it felt like we were in someones home. We started with arancini which was amazing then came our pizza, we split the Margherita & was not disappointed. The real show stopper was the linguine cacao e pepe, oh my goodness this was absolute perfection! So creamy and cheesy! I would definitely come back for that pasta alone!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had the 'just passable' 3-part lunch specials, and ended up with the same pasta (ragu-styled fettucini), tiny caesar and assorted veg salads, little sides of hummus in olive oil and spicy tomato, but overall were let down by the relative tasteless of these 5 choices. No snap or crackle or 'order me again' even whispered to us. Just ho-hum.
For these $16 lunches, you too can be bored.
The entree meals may be better, but we won't ever return.

If you want pasta, ViaCibo is much better and the flavours left on your palate endure afterwards (14th St. at 15th Ave SW).
If you want pizza, Blaze with their fresh 'make-your-own' options will impress nicely (21nd Ave. at 4th St. SW)
Interesting how fresh ingredients and wholesome flavours endure in one's mouth for a couple hours later!

But not at this place. It's so mediocre that the sporadic service just adds to it. Don't bother anyone..."}
{"text":"Great romantic spot and you can't beat the wine list.  Pizza is fantastic and well with it.  We split the pesto salad and it was excellent.  We also loved the outdoor music on Friday night.

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Fresh made pasta is something I eat a couple times a year. Tonight was a pretty good pasta experience. Things I loved about this place: outdoor patio that was very well decorated and live music playing at dark. Service was wonderful, attentive but not over bearing. My salad was fresh and shaved cheese was delicious!"}
{"text":"Cibo is excellent! The atmosphere, service, and food are all spectacular. Also prices are very reasonable. Patio is great as well, especially with the live music. Blows bianco out of the water, plus you don't have to wait two hours. Also great location, very homey. I take all out of towners here. Great for date night!"}
{"text":"It's hard to write a review for a restaurant that is loved by so many others as an Elite Yelper, and have to give it a \"Meh\" review. Cibo initially won me over with its great atmosphere, fantastic hosts and delicious appetizers, but it did not last. Be prepared for a lengthy review because I'd really like to describe my experience in full.

I wound up at Cibo with a decent-sized group (12 total, I believe), and everything started off great; the drinks began flowing and the appetizer was being passed around for all to share. The process for ordering was a little slow, but busy Friday night, large table...no biggie. I completely understood, and we kept ourselves busy with conversation. After a bit we got our entr√©e orders in and everyone went with pizzas, and not 10 minutes later, they began to arrive.

Now, being the first visit for me, I decided to ask for recommendations. That's just what I like to do because I like to hear a server get really excited about one of their favorite dishes. For the white pizzas, our server suggested the Di Notte. I was instantly sold, so much so that I asked for a suggestion on the red pizzas. He then mentioned the Capricciosa, and after a brief chat between him, my girlfriend and myself (Important Note: about the artichokes on the pizza), I told him that we'd take it.

Going back to the arrival of the pizzas...they came out staggered, which made sense since there is only one pizza oven. We all began sharing as each pie came out, and life was good. First we got our Di Notte (a delicious mix of cheese and spicy salami) which was cooked perfectly and tasted great! A little later, after other pie orders began filling the table, came a vegetarian. The runners are slammed, and they just call out the names of the pizzas and wait for a hand to be raised. Not really hearing the name correctly, I asked if that was the pizza with the artichokes. The runner said yes, and I took the pizza (Note: I was the only one at the table that had artichokes on my pizza). This all brings me to the most awkward moment at a restaurant for me in a very long time. 

We decided to wait on touching the vegetarian pizza because we thought the runner just delivered to the wrong table. It happens, and I was totally ready to hand that pie over unscathed. But when our server came back and I mentioned the potential mistake, he told me that was what I ordered and continued to repeat it over and over. This was an embarrassing situation mostly because I took HIS recommendation because it was my first visit, and we had never even mentioned the \"Vegetariana,\" and because during the conversation we were having the whole table fell silent (funny little extra - the musician just started his break as well...complete silence). He caused a scene even after I had told him it was alright and we'd just take the pizza because it was a mistake. I tried not to place any blame and talked to him with a \"this happens\" kind of demeanor, but he insisted that that's what we ordered...PLUS he said that he specifically remembered us ordering that because we weren't interested in artichokes. Guess what's on the Vegetariana, folks? Yep. Artichokes. A whole fourth of the pizza was covered in them (I love artichokes, by the way. This posed no problem.). Once that was pointed out, instead of any sort of apology, he decided to explain how the artichokes were only on one \"quadrant\" of the pizza. C'mon now...I can see a bullshitter, and that was just blatant. It's ridiculous to claim that we ordered a different pizza because of one particular ingredient only to order another with the SAME ingredient. I hope you, the reader, is understanding the uncomfortable situation that I was in because it was a weird one. I kind of couldn't wait to get out of there for the remainder of the dinner.

That all being said, the woman at the cash bar, Melissa, was great, and she really made an effort to make our table feel a little more comfortable after the whole incident. I hope the owner of Cibo can take note of that because it wasn't really her job, but she was sweet, personable and took it upon herself to feel embarrassed and responsible for our server.

My first trip to Cibo was a bust, and it's really hard to want to make a return visit, but in time I'm sure I will. I can't let one bad experience dictate how I completely feel about such a beloved local restaurant. Sorry for the length, but I hope this review can be of help to someone. The food and the atmosphere was good, but my experience with the service totally overshadowed them."}
{"text":"So, I've been to Cibo three times and it's gotten better every time I went. 
My first time, I had the bruschetta, lamb meatballs, pear pizza and gelato - all delicious. It was November though and they seated us right beside a window, so it was a little cold for my taste. 
My second time going was on a double date. We each had a past entree and were not disappointed. At first, the portions looked way too small, but each one was filling and full of flavour. 
My last time going was just recently for my little sister's 18th birthday and we had a blast. We ordered the bruschetta, eggplant and buffalo mozzarella. The first two were amazing, but I found the mozzarella a bit lacking in flavour. As mains we had the pear and sun dried tomato pizza as well as an order of the gnocchi. The pizzas were crisp and light, and the gnocchi was crunchy with a bit of zesty tang! The waitstaff were amazing in wishing my sister well and they even brought us an extra birthday shot. Even when my mom returned a drink, they politely brought another drink to her without a question. 
I love Cibo, and I love being able to book a reservation on the OpenTable app and I will certainly be returning."}
{"text":"Felt like I was back in Italy!  Very authentic menu, just like you would find in Italy.  The Pizze Bianche (white pizza) is more of a olive oil based pizza as apposed to a more traditional red marinara sauce or even an alfredo sauce pizza.  They are delicious and very traditional!  You cant go wrong with any of their choices.  The wine list was very nice and the pinot noir we enjoyed was excellent.  The waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable and helped us with our selection quite a bit.  This is a very popular spot in downtown Phoenix, so if going on a Fri or Sat night, expect to wait a little.  We waited (with a glass of wine) about 20 min to get a seat for two at the peak time on a Fri, but was well worth it!  The outside seating was very pretty and the whole establishment was quaint and really took you away to Europe."}
{"text":"Oh Diavola, how you delight me so!  Incredible!!  The pizza was one of the better that I have ever had. Although I was stuffed, we decided to split a Fresca for dessert and it was so good!  Amazing lunch spot. It was very easy to get in and out and the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I have dined here a few times and every time the food and service has been great.  What is distinctive about Cibo is its ambiance - the lovely patio with old trees providing the shade.  It is so pleasant.

For evening happy hour, I have twice shared the platter with meat, cheese, etc. and it is quite good with a glass of wine.  The thin crust pizza is excellent, too.  I hope to try more things.

The servers are friendly and in my experience, fast.  And unlike many downtown Phoenix restaurants, parking is pretty easy.  That does make a difference."}
{"text":"Story time: called early on the morning of Dec 22nd to make reservations for 12. They were full for evening reservations but were totally pro about guiding me to the \"No Wait\" app. That sounded like a plan.  On the way down there we launched the app and attempted to put in our group, but the app maxes out at 6 for this particular establishment, we put 6 and added a note. 

When we arrived they were a bit shocked at our group size, but they took care of it. We waiting no more than 15 minutes and we're seated in a sort of guest house out back with 2 other large groups. It was great! 

Now to the food. Sweet mother of all that is holy, the Diavola pizza was AMMMAAAZZZZINNNG!!!!!

We opted for Gluten Free crust and it was out of this world. One of the best pies I've ever had. Then we got crepes and they made he pizza look more humble...which I wouldn't have bet was possible.  

This place is stellar! Staff is world class, food is other worldly and it's super cute and charming.

Stop reading, go eat."}
{"text":"My husband and I lived in Italy for 4 years, so we're always on the hunt for amazing Italian restaurants...especially pizza places. Cibo was wonderful! We had the buratta was so good and the pizza was delicious. Apparently our pizza took a while to get out to us (we didn't think we waited that long), so our server gave us a nutella crepe on the house. It was also amazing! The weather was nice, so we ate dinner al fresco, and listened to the lovely blues guitarist playing. I also appreciated the lotion in the women's restroom (it's the little things!). We'll definitely be back to Cibo soon!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: very cute outdoor patio/seating. Perfect for a casual night out with friends/first date/significant other

Food: very authentic Italian (thin crust) pizza. Recommend the vegetariana. 

Price: Decent $11-15 per pizza. 

Service: Friendly but very slow. Be prepared to wait at least half an hour on weekends to get a table and  table service is slow as well  (they don't take reservations for parties under 6). Parking is a bit of a nightmare. 

Service/parking is why I would rate my overall experience as 3, but food wise definitely a 4."}
{"text":"Awesome food and Tony &
 Karen are the friendliest folks ever - what an amazing menu.service is always outstanding 9th check in here. Come hungry - love the Diavola pizza .. Actually never had a bad meal!! Ciao Bella"}
{"text":"Great date night.  Staff was easy to work with and the food is tasty.  They do have a patio if you'd prefer sitting outside.

***** (5 Stars)- Amazing, zero flaws, a must go! (Not given often)

**** (4 Stars)- Memorable, strongly feel you should visit

*** (3 Stars)- Above average, worth a visit

** (2 Stars)- Average, some pro's and some con's

* (1 Star)- Opinion is do not go, below average"}
{"text":"This place is quite nice. Pizza is great. Food is great. Staff was great. I love cibos and everytime I suggest this to someone, they love it too!"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing, but I think it gets better every time I come in. The Rustica pizza is to die for and good for two people. Also, you must try their Nutella and Mascarpone crepe (it's crack). The service is good without being annoying. They make sure you have everything you need, and then actually leave you alone so you can enjoy your meal. Over all, extremely satisfying."}
{"text":"It's pizza.  Yes, it is fired in a brick oven and yes, it blows Littles Ceasars or Dominoes out of the water...but it is still pizza.  I go here occasionally because the food really is tasty.  And the ambiance is cool-- being in an old historic home in downtown Phx.  But the service, while prompt, is never very warm or friendly. (for lack of a better word)  Every single time I go here to eat, I leave in disbelief that I dropped a $100 dollar bill practically on a two topping pizza and a glass of wine.  I give it 3 stars simply because I feel it is over-priced."}
{"text":"We popped in on a Sunday evening and were surprised at how busy this restaurant was, and we were fortunate to get a seat without a wait. Unbeknownst to us on Sunday Cibo's pizzas are 1/2 price and their draft beer is $4. That explains a lot with regard to the crowd! 

Not surprising we ordered a couple of pizzas. I ordered the Mushroom and my husband ordered the Wild Boar Bacon. They were both very delicious and the crust is some of the best Neopolitan style that I have tasted. The only demerit was that the use of truffle oil on the Mushroom pizza was a little heavy-handed. 

Our server, with her trainee in tow, was very pleasant and efficient. The accoustics of the full house made conversation somewhat difficult, but we were too busy filling our faces to care much!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, surprisingly family friendly, live music (I went on a Tuesday night) and wonderful outdoor dinning. I was visiting from the cold Midwest so it was lovely being able to eat outside in March. I ordered the Margherita pizza and a wheat beer that the waiter recommended."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Phoenix! Try the balsamic onions!"}
{"text":"We had two pies (1 reg and 1 gluten free) and their Italian market salad special. One of my favorite indulgences is a good pizza with a red wine but it's hard to find decent gf pizza. At Cibo, my prayer was answered! I had the best gf pizza ever! Even my husband said it's as good as a regular pizza. My husband loved his salad with farro as well. We are not from Phoenix but we will be sure to return to Cibo next time in town!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in town. Great food, amazing atmosphere and unique location! Love, love the Prosciutto crudo."}
{"text":"Went for lunch by myself when I was serving as a juror at the Municpal Court.  I loved it.  The service was great.  The food was outstanding.  The price was good.  The old house had a wonderful feeling.  I will return again for sure!  

I had an eggplant parm sandwhich with a salad and highly recommend both!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to say that I was not impressed by Cibo. I'm really disappointed after reading all of the amazing reviews of this place. I will say that the atmosphere was great. The patio seating was really charming and the twinkle lights were pretty. I went for dinner with friends but it would have been a nice place for a date as well. 

But our service was less than stellar. Once we got our food, we had to flag people down to get any more attention. Someone took our empty water carafe and never brought more water. One of my friends got the margherita pizza which she described as \"ok\". My second friend got the¬† rustica pizza. She said that she wished she could taste something. I got the tartufata pizza. I liked all the toppings but it just didn't have much flavor. The pizza was also soggy in the middle. The slice just kind of flopped down as I picked it up and all the toppings fell off. 

Worst of all, there were two stray cats wandering around the patio as we ate. It was so disgusting to feel them brush against my leg passing under my chair and under our table as we tried to enjoy our dinner. The staff didn't seem to care or attempt to keep them away from people; everyone simply walked past them. It just felt very unsanitary.

Maybe I came on an off night, but Cibo definitely did not live up to the hype."}
{"text":"absolutely amazing place. it's hard to believe this place even exists in phoenix.

i've only gone their at lunchtime when they only serve sandwiches and salads. some of the best italian sandwiches i've ever had. they run about 9 dollars, but they are big and come with a salad.

you also have to split a strawberry nutella crepe for desert with somebody sometime. they are amazing.

only problem is trying to find parking and there is very little indoor seating, which makes it hard to eat at during the summer. but for the rest of the year, there is a great patio surrounded by greenery. great place to relax.

beware it also has some strange hours. no lunch on the weekends and there are some nights where they don't serve dinner.

the staff is also extremely friendly and helpful.

UPDATE - 09/24/2007 - I finally went to Cibo for dinner the other weekend and I can see why the reviews aren't as high as I would expect. The quality of the pizza is disappointing when compared to the quality of their sandwiches. However the pizza is still great (as well as affordable) and the atmosphere at this place is even better at night (especailly on an amazing night like last Friday).

But if you have been to Cibo for dinner and been dissapointed, I would recommend going and trying a Spek, Salsicca, or Vegetarian sandwich for lunch some day."}
{"text":"This is a very nice place to bring a love one for a date night :)

Located in downtown Phoenix, Cibo has great customer service and their pizza is DELICIOUS!!! The only reason I gave them 4 out of 5 stars is that the price was a little high. The customer service was great and they made us feel right at home. My little sister-in-law even commented how the venue was so cute because the restaurant was inside a house.

Great place, would recommend out-of-towners to visit this lovely place."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Tooo romantic. Must sit out. Great pizza. Crepes can be better. But they come gluten free which is rare and good for me."}
{"text":"I have been there several times and enjoyed myself. Isn't that all we ever really want out of life? Enjoyment. But last night I went and had the calzone and it was amazing. The best thing I've ever had there. The patio is awesome. I love people watching at Cibo. My only complaint is the crepes. Everyone loves their crepes but I just think they're so blah. Crepes need to break your heart. Crepes needs to make you feel sick afterward. The whipped cream they use is pointless and watery. MAKE HOMEMADE WHIPPED CREAM! and if you do already make it better. And they should be just a little bit bigger. But overall, I would totally recommend this quaint little place for dates or work dinners. Just get dessert elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was possibly one of the best meals my wife and I have ever had.  Farfelle along with their spinach salad.  The waitress was magnificent- smiling, helpful, responsive, caring and prompt, but only when we wanted something.  Not \"bothersome\".  If I'm ever in Calgary again I will definitely eat here."}
{"text":"Not bad.  The atmosphere is really the best part about this place.  Cute outdoor dining area that is draped in lights.   Sometimes they have live music.  Food misses the mark in comparison to the million other pizza restaurants in Central Phoenix.  I feel like they would do better if they featured more pasta options."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out and it was incredible! My wife said their gluten free pizza crust was the best she has ever had! The restaurant looks like a great spot to chill. The outdoor patio was packed and had great music. Would definitely eat here again next time we are back in Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere; it feels like a bit of Berkley in Phoenix.  The owners seem like they are really into it.  We started with a couple of their really good salads, totally delicious. When it came to the pizza - ummm, I expected better.  The toppings were pretty good (we ordered 3 different pizzas) but the crust fell short.  Thin crust which when done right is excellent,sadly this wasn't one of those times. I have a couple server pet peeves and one those peeves popped up at Cibo;  throughout the dining experience (and no matter where you are, whether it be In-N-Out or Le Cirque, it should be a dining experience) the server takes no interest in your table other than to take your order and deliver - then suddenly out of no where, 5 minutes before he/she is about to present the check, this new person emerges.  He/she now has a personality where absolutely none existed before and they want to know about your needs.  Now I really understand when the restaurant is so busy that you're lucky to even recognize your server, but if there isn't a wait...C'mon."}
{"text":"I had not been to Cibo since it first opened and was pleasantly surprised again last night...such a charming place, friendly staff and truly delicious pizza.  We shared the funghi pizza and a split of spicy salame with ricotta and sausage pizza ...so good and even the crust was amazing too!  For dessert we shared the nutella and strawberry crepe...oh my, you must try this - so divine and the perfect way to end your meal!"}
{"text":"Before Yesterday, I have only had Cibo pizza in take-out format, which I would not recommend. Cibo pizza is best eaten soon after it comes out of the oven. Last night, we order two pizzas, a red and a white. For the red we got half Funghi and half Capricciosa. For the white we ordered Dolce Vita and Tartufata. I thought I would enjoy the red more, but it was the two white ones that were the winners. 

Both pizzas came out warm with burnt crust. The pizza is thin and a little soft in the center, which made for a soft, doughy crust. If I had to pick a favorite of the night, it would be the Dolce Vita. Creamy burrata cheese topped with spek, arugula, and a slightly sour/sweet balsamic glaze was the perfect combination. The other three were old delicious and flavorful as well.

To go with our pizzas, we ordered the calamari and assortment of grilled mixed vegetables. Both were average but I was disappointed that the vegetables were cold and did not taste grilled. I would not order either again. 

Parking can be difficult in this residential neighborhood and the wait to get a table can get long as well. The outdoor seating area is beautiful with twinkle lights making the place sparkle  every night. Cibo is a great place for date night or just a casual get-together with friends. 

What I recommend:
- using the Yelp app to hold your place in line
- Dolce Vita (pizze bianche)"}
{"text":"My go-to place for a great fired pizza...everything here is delicious and great ambiance in historical downtown.  Great place to sit outside and enjoy lunch in our awesome weather as well (note that lunch has a slightly different menu and includes sandwiches).  Favorites include the Omero salad, Prosciutto Crudo and Diavola pizzas, and the Fresca for dessert.  Recommended over Pizzeria Bianco.  I wish I could more stars for this place..."}
{"text":"Cibo is a go to for delicious sandwiches and pizza! The saltimbocca bread is perfectly baked and so fresh. It is a cute little restaurant in an old Phoenix house with a great patio to enjoy your meal on if it is a nice day/evening. 

Personal favorites: Alla Parmigana, Caprese & Tonno Sandwiches

Only minor thing I would have to say is on a busy day sometimes service feels understaffed. It may take a little bit to get drink refills etc. But that was only if I was being super critical, usually it is great!"}
{"text":"2010/07/08 - Had dinner at Cibo tonight with a friend and once again I am impressed with their service and food.  We started with some wine, the veggie plate which was much larger than expected (in a good way) and then the Genova pizza which is a white pizza with pesto, potatoes, onions, cheese and maybe a few others.  The wait staff was excellent too!  I look forward to my next trip to Cibo."}
{"text":"Love the urban ambience, great wine list, but the salad and sandwich menu is to die for. I've visited this place many times over the past 5 years and the quality of their food and service remains consistently outstanding."}
{"text":"LOVED THE cute in this place:-) Went here on a date.. its coolio for that.. HOWEVER, I didnt care for the pizza we had... and its not to say the other pizzas arent better! I had the Pesto, my 'date' ordered.. I just thought the combo of potatoes with pesto on a crust was odd.. BUT I loved the antipasto platter.. a huge assortment of olives.. and the marinade was awesome.. Great wine.. great service! Ill go back for sure... and just order something without potatoes and pesto!! :-)"}
{"text":"This place was great! We were told by some locals to come here rather than waiting in a two hour line for the other favorite pizza spot in the area.  the atmosphere really made the dinner!   It's an old house redone as a restaurant... we sat outside and there were twinkly lights everywhere and a great jazz musician playing live music in the background.  
Our group of 10 ordered 8 different pizza's plus a couple of the special pasta dishes.  Both pasta dishes were out of this world, and the pizza's were tasty and above average.  (but i'm super picky about my pizza's) It was a great meal and a great atmosphere, and next time I visit I would go back."}
{"text":"Very good pizza here. There is no wait and there is a WIDE selection of items. I love the white pizza so I would definitely recommend that to anyone who heads on in. Excellent beer selection too."}
{"text":"Great restaurant experience. The food was fantastic and the server was absolutely first class. We brought the kids and had an excellent night out. We were all raving about every aspect when we left. 

This place is great for all ages and tastes!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!!! Love the outdoors and birds everywhere. Such a cool remodel still has the old trees, and the food is good! Will be coming back for dinner menus can't wait to see what's in store. Also the water is good :) love places with bottles on the table"}
{"text":"Fell in love with this hidden gem last night! Tucked away in a neighborhood in Phoenix, this place definitely did not disappoint!

Not only did the server comp our bottle of wine, but the food was out of this world. Tried the burrata and everything was full of flavor. They also had live music and lights on the patio for perfect ambience. I would recommend for a date night or special occasion as its moderately priced."}
{"text":"We were recently at Cibo for our wedding rehearsal dinner and rented out the carriage room in the back. We were extremely pleased with the food and service we received and our guests raved about how good the food was. For anyone looking for a rehearsal dinner for a smaller group, we had around 20-25 guests, I would highly recommend dining at Cibo."}
{"text":"Great place... i went there for lunch... I found the menu not real large but the food was excellent... they basically had sandwhices that were made with pizza bread and then a choice of side... i had mine with a salad and it was 9 bucks... not too bad of prices for the amount of food you get... i am really looking forward to tryign it at night... you should check it out!"}
{"text":"Cibo was definitely worth the hype. We ordered two of the red pizzas and each tasted fresh and delicious. I'd reccomend the da Vinci as it was a masterpiece."}
{"text":"Amazing crepes! The berry crepes were to die for. I want to try the Nutella ones next time."}
{"text":"I love Cibo it is a really cool restaurant. I have gone here about 3 times and had a great experience each time. My favorite part about it is the atmosphere. It is in an old house possibly early 1900s near downtown Phoenix. I have eaten in the dining room, the parlor and out on the lawn. My favorite was on the lawn, it was a beatiful day and we had the antipasto platter. They also had live music that evening and the vibe was fabulous. The other dish that stands out in my mind was the Nutella Crepes, I had them for dessert and they were scrumptious. The wait is sometimes long and parking can be a little tough but it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I love Cibo!!! They have this delicious salad with a pesto dressing and I add their tuna on it. MMMMM Their tuna salad is not like regular tuna salad, because they don't use any mayo. They use olive oil and spices, so it is healthier, but still has a lot of flavor. I have had their pizza before and it is very good as well. Great place and prices for happy hour. I would definitely recommend everyone try Cibo. :)"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place in the world for date night. Share a bottle of wine and a pizza and don't forget a Nutella crepe for dessert. Love love love this place."}
{"text":"The service was decent! But if you sit outside expect to be attacked by bees and birds... I got a margheritta pizza. It was alright, kind of plain tasting but if you ask for balsamic glaze it makes it better! My husband really liked his polpette saltimbocca and everything was a decent price.

Edit: don't bring large bills as they can't accommodate the change..."}
{"text":"The Keg at San Tan Village, Gilbert, AZ - Thursday Sept 5th, 2013, about 7:00pm. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.

I have been a huge fan of this Keg for many years, so that's what inspired me to write this review. In our party of five I ordered the Classic Filet, medium. When it arrived the first few bites were OK, but on the 3rd or 4th bite I bit into some grizzle. I thought that was odd, being that this was a filet mignon, but I decided to ignore it and kept eating. The last 1/8 of the steak however, turned out to be one big piece of grizzle. That's when I stopped eating and mentioned it to the waiter who in turn called over the manager (he did not offer his name, I did not ask). That's where the biggest disappointment came. I explained the problem to him, and tried to show him how tough the last piece was. He seemed uninterested in examining the offending piece of meat. As if reading from a prepared script for disgruntled diners, he admitted that once in a while a little \"silver skin\" may escape the notice of the chef (this remaining piece was easily 1/2\" thick). And then he proceeded to lecture me TWICE about how I should have let them know early on so they could have corrected the problem, completely ignoring the fact that the problem piece was at the end of the meal. It felt as if he was implying that I was trying to scam a free meal.

To their credit, they took the meal off the bill, which was the right thing to do, and no else in our party had a bad meal. But grizzle in a filet? Really? I have never encountered grizzle in filet mignon. There are plenty of other steak places in our area to try out - DC Steakhouse comes to mind - but The Keg has slipped a notch, a BIG notch, in my book. It's a real shame."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I can put Cibo on par with Pizzeria Bianco. I just can't.

It's pretty close, though. And when you factor in wait times (15 minutes on a First Friday night at 7pm), parking (much better, being on the west side of downtown), and leftovers (the pizza crust holds up remarkably well under microwaving), it's really no question.

We started with the burrata, and I really can't recommend this enough: two mountains of creamy, fresh mozzarella, sliced prosciutto that melts in your mouth, and toasted bread that's just soft enough to keep from dicing the roof of your mouth. The only problem was, by the end of it (and we scraped every bit of cheese up) we were hardly hungry. Between the two pizzas we ordered between my wife, me, and our daughter, we finished less than half. From now on, we'll go with the burrata, and split a pie...though then we'd miss out on the leftovers. I'll have to rethink this.

A few minor quibbles: it'd be nice of the beers were on tap. My Lagunitas IPA wasn't quite cold enough. Also, the main entrance is a tight fit, but it's worth it for the ambiance, I think.

Beyond that, though, everything about Cibo, from the food to the charming owners, was exceptional. I only half-jested that I'd like to go back today."}
{"text":"delicious pizza. this place was highly rated on Yelp and so we had to come and check it out. We came during lunch time so we couldn't take advantage of sitting outside. The restaurant decor is relaxing and beautiful. Since we came during lunch time, we lucked out and were able to order a dinner time menu item. we started off with arancini balls. The rice ball was a tad salty but still delicious. we ordered diavalo (spicy salami) and tartafata pizza. The spicy salami pizza was our favorite. It had just the right amount of kick to it. The tartafata was a bit too salty for us. We loved the thin crust pizza and had just enough sauce go with it."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! The best pizza in town and the best ambiance ever, especially if you sit outside when the weather is nice. Sometimes a bit of a wait with limitted wait area, but well worth the wait. Save room for dessert, the crepes are yummy too."}
{"text":"The food is sooo delicious!! Also they have a fantastic happy hour. They serve gluten free as well! Excellent day."}
{"text":"Cibo really is a great spot for date night or a romantic dinner. 
We got seated inside and they really set the mood... the lights were so dim I almost whipped out my phone's flashlight app to look at the menu.

We started with the pesto salad (mixed greens, pine nuts, tomatoes, roasted potatoes and parmesan cheese). I thought the salad was excellent. The potatoes were warm and paired with the cooler ingredients was really interesting (in a good way). The server brought out bread and our choice of olive oil. We chose a red chili flakes infused olive oil. This was nice and spicy had a good kick to it.

For our entree we shared the margherita pizza. Really good thin, slightly charred crust. Good classic pizza. 

For dessert we split a nutella crepe with strawberries and bananas. I was in chocolate heaven! 

Overall a great place for dinner... and they have complimentary valet parking!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The food is some of the best Italian food I have ever had, especially in Phoenix. It's bet similar to the food I had in Italy. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went here for my 31st birthday through a recommendation from a friend.  I was happy I did, they accomodated my request of a party of 8, that went down to a party of 6 then 5.  We dined al fresco and it was a fabulous nite for it.  We shared 3 appetizers: pear salad, bruschetta and the caprese salad, we also went with a margharita, salsiccio, and did a half rustica and half di notte.  We all got to try a little bit of everything and was throroughly please with the quality of the ingredients and the deliciousness.  I really wanted to have the crepes but my friend surprized me with cupcakes that were were fabulous but I digress. This place is perfect for a variety of things, a date, a group of friends or a family dinner.  I definitely will be back to check out the crepes."}
{"text":"wow im just going for it yes 5 stars fantastic staff excellent pizza and i love the appitizer platter, we had a nice bottle of wine and fantastic house made lemoncello,"}
{"text":"I got the BBQ pork sandwich and it was great! The bun they used was unique and had great flavor. It came with truffle fries that were really tasty too. The decor was homey and vintage. The service wasn't good at all after we got our food. I was checked on one time maybe. But overall pretty good"}
{"text":"Pizza is not to shabby here. I like it better than Bianco and in some ways is comparable to a New York slice. But definitely a good decision to check out CIBO if you're in the mood for a good pizza in Phoenix! One key to good pizza is the dough and the crust is soft!

Great atmosphere, ambiance, quaint any time of the year. Love the outdoor seating on the patio with fire areas, live music and an assortment of lights. Service was okay, I had an empty water the whole meal. 

I would definitely come back here and try some other pizzas and maybe an entree. For dessert, we had the strawberry banana crepe with Nutella - I mean a crepe with chcoclate, yum. But they were out of their other chocolate dessert :( Let me rewind back to appetizer, caprese salad is enough for a handful of people. The mozzarella tossed with pesto, oregano, EVOO, chopped fresh basil and grape tomatoes is absolutely scrumptious. 

Check it out !"}
{"text":"Awesome gluten free pizza, salads and beautiful atmosphere. Love eating on the patio, it's a great date night restaurant! Love eating here when we go to First Friday. Great service too. Recently heard they offer gluten free crepes now too; cannot wait to try!! Two thumbs way up."}
{"text":"Been to Cibo a few times and really liked it for the 17th Ave scene. Was disappointed a few weeks ago that they changed their menu as we liked a lot of the appetizers and entrees that they had before

Pizzas are yummy with a good crust. Nice wine selection. Pastas are delicious with great homemade pasta"}
{"text":"Food is fine, valet is terrible. Meeting my girlfriend and a colleague of hers for lunch. Plenty of space in the parking lot for the valet to run an efficient operation. They turned away me and the 2 cars in front of my saying they were \"full\". Really guys? Isn't this the idea behind having a valet??? So then I go park miles away. Good job Cibo, good job."}
{"text":"What a great place! I yelped this restaraunt on the way to the airport. The service was speedy and the food is phenomenal. I got the funghi pizza with Italian sausage and my brother got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. It was the best pulled pork sandwich I have ever tried. I only gave it four stars cause the service was a little awkward. Our waitress didn't talk much but it wouldn't be enough to prevent me from going there again. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"awesome pizza,  great ambiance,   friendly service,  I would highly recommend this spot"}
{"text":"Last night me and my girlfriend went for dinner we were seated outside next to a tree with lights it was about 1030PM We ordered two pizzas witch one was really burn, the waiter took about 20 minutes to check on us we didn't have no water no drinks no napkins and no silverware this was my first and last visit here. It seemed like the waiter just wanted to go home already really bad experienced."}
{"text":"The best gluten free pizza crust I have ever had - made from rice and potato (not just rice flour, like the usual GF fare).  Solid wine list.  Great Caprese Salad.  Quaint setting - reminds me of House of Tricks in Tempe.  Decent wine list - although our server didn't know anything about the wines.  We asked her to ask the bartender to help.  He also knew very little.  In an effort to provide good service, they told us that if we didn't like our bottle, the staff would drink it at the end of the night and we could order another."}
{"text":"I have never been unhappy after a meal at Cibo! I've been three times, and have sat twice on the patio and once upstairs. The patio is a lovely terrace that makes you feel like you've stepped right into Italy. Except, unlike Italy, the service is fantastic!

The food. Oh my goodness. The pizza! I'm salivating thinking about it. It's a thin crust piece of deliciousness. You can get a bunch of items from the menu and share, or hoard it all to yourself. Either way, you win.

I have nothing bad to say about Cibo. Just go! You'll be so happy! I want that happiness for you!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich, delicious fries and pizza made the right way - meaning thin crisp crust (now there is a tongue twister for you), tasteful and not too greasy. I stopped by a few times during a business trip where I stayed at a nearby hotel. 

The outside area is great for gatherings, with live music and plentiful shade under the trees. 

For you loners out there, I can recommend sitting at the bar. Lively atmosphere, great service."}
{"text":"Holy Cow!! How have I lived here 13 years and never been here? This place is an old house that has been redone into a restaurant and wine bar. The patio under the twinkle lights is like something from a movie! We had the prosciutto pizza and the nuttella crepe. I cannot stop telling people about them. The bottles that the water is served in are super cool as well. My mouth is watering as I write this."}
{"text":"If you can, get a group of friends together and make a reservation early!  They only take them for groups, but unless you want to wait 1+ hours, it's required on busy nights.  Nice setting, especially nice outside.  

Ordered 7 pizzas for a group of 8, but that had some children.  All were good to great.  I think the simple pizza margherita was the best, and a great value at only $10.  When I come back, I think I'll be tempted just to order 2 of these and a salad for my family of two adults and two children.  

Just a nice setting, cool older building, busy hip crowd, and great pizza that comes super hot and fresh out of the oven. 

Only reason I am giving this a 4 star is that our service was slow.  I didn't mind too much since it was so busy and I was with great people, but it took about 20 minutes from when I asked for the check to when I was able to sign and walk away, despite me putting the credit card down immediately.  The server just had other priorities.  In fact, they had the table cleared and were literally seating other people at the table before we had the check back.  So a bit of a slip up.  

Still, they were very friendly, and it was a great meal.  I recommend this highly as a  date spot or even a family spot.  Loud and so very easy to just focus on your table."}
{"text":"First impressions for me are always a tell tale sign of how a restaurant experience is going to be. 

Chocolate was on my seat, luckily I didn't sit down in it and I had noticed it. I moved the chair to another table and let my server know. The seat was never wiped off. Also my boyfriends water glass had lip stick on it so we had to ask for a fresh one. 

I had the tuna which was really dry but the bread was really delicious. PLT is spicy and prosciutto was okay, nothing great. Pizza was okay. 

The server never checked on us after food was dropped, worst part, the place was DEAD. 

Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great atmosphere! Wait was a little long and unorganized, but worth the wait"}
{"text":"I dream about their Diavola Pizza every time I'm in the neighborhood. A very romantic setting, with a huge outdoor seating area and small, but cozy interior. I have only ever had a few of their different pizzas, but have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I am happy to update my very poor review of Cibo from several months ago and get on the fan bandwagon with all of my fellow Yelpers. I also want to thank the proprietors who took my previous review seriously and encouraged me to give them another opportunity. I wish it hadn't taken me so long to get back to Cibo (life tends to get in the way!!) and believe me, it won't be long before my next visit.

We returned for lunch today and were seated right away. The place wasn't near as busy as the last visit because many had Columbus Day off work. Our server welcomed us promptly and took our drink orders. We decided on hot sandwiches: Sicilian sausage and pulled pork. OMG - they were soooo delicious!!! The pork was lean, tender and in a wonderful spicy (but not overly) sauce. The Fontina cheese was a great touch and tasteful. The bread...ummmmm good. I'm tired of getting sandwiches on so much bread that you can't open your mouth wide enough to bite - the grilled saltimbocca bread was so good! The sausage sandwich was super flavorful with the perfect amount of peppers and onions. Again, the bread complimented the sandwich.

The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it took a while to get our bill. While we weren't in a hurry, the server walked by our table a couple of times and didn't check in on us. As I mentioned the place wasn't overly busy at all so I would have expected a tad more attentiveness. But overall, the food was outstanding and the quaintness of the little house made for nice ambience. 

I'm not a fan of eating crow, but if I have to, I will. I bet the chef at Cibo could even make crow taste phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Pizza was very good service was terrible. Waitress was rude and for that reason I probably won't return. That's a shame that the employees reflect so badly on this business. If you are not a people person than being a server is probably not a great career choice."}
{"text":"Cibo is the CUTEST eatery I have ever been to in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area. 

My boyfriend and I happened to be in the area, and turned to our trusty pal Yelp for some assistance. With four and a half stars and over 500 reviews, this place definitely caught our attention. 

Located just minutes away from Downtown Phoenix, we were almost deterred away when we found Cibo located next to residential properties. But when we walked in, we were definitely down. It looks like a little tucked away cottage, something you wouldn't find next to the city. 

The place is literally built in a refurbished little home. We walked in and were seated immediately. The menu was a tad difficult to understand, but wasn't that much of a deterrent, as we used yelp photos as our guide. 

My only complaint is that they don't serve pizza until 5 p.m., but that wasn't really a big deal, as we made choices on the menu regardless. 

I got the cous cous salad and the boyfriend got the meatball sandwich with chips. 
Cous Cous salad came with fresh spring mix lettuce, diced grape tomatoes, pine nuts, cous cous, onions, and some other ingredients, and was dressed in a light lemon dressing. The dressing really was refreshing and light, but the salad itself was super filling and extremely flavorful! I would recommend it! 

The meatball sandwich was really delicious as well. The meatballs seemed authentic and fresh, and it came with melted cheese and warm marinara sauce in between the crispy, yummy bread. 

The bread that they served on the side of the entrees wasn't bad at all-- but it was served cold, which wasn't very appetizing, so I only ate one piece. 

Service is friendly and helpful, and unique. I like places that allow their employees to dress how they wish. It adds a homey flare to the restaurant. 

We definitely need to return for dinner on their cozy little patio! When I'm in the Downtown area again, I'll make sure to stop by at Cibo"}
{"text":"A gem in downtown Phoenix.  Food and wine was delicious and staff was very informed and friendly.  The building makes this dining experience even better, so cute and cozy.  We need more of this in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Caprese salad drenched in bitter balsalmico, cherry tomatoes were sour and made up over 1/2  the salad

Penne came with a lump of melted cheese in the bottom, cold pasta on top that was dry as all moisture gone.

Tried adding olive oil, but too late, sent it back

Went down the road and ate pasta there instead"}
{"text":"Cibo serves up some top notch pizza.  They're open late enough that I was able to grab dinner there after my flight in. We had the Margherita and La Noce (ricotta, arugula, and walnuts).  Pies are of the thin crust, gourmet variety, and both were fantastic.

The restaurant is tucked away on a residential street, but the outdoor lighting and patio seating give it away.  Misting devices are sprinkled throughout for dining out on those hot summer nights.  The decor inside is quaint and cozy.  The staff were friendly and the food came out promptly. 

I wouldn't hesitate to return."}
{"text":"Finally - a restaurant in Calgary that offers great food, prices and service. I felt like I was in Vancouver again! Pizza, pasta were top-notch. Wine list that was affordable (esp. for those not working in oil sector), and fun to eat appies. Prices are comparable to Earls or Joey's, but better in taste and larger in portion. I'll definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a work lunch and I am not sure I will be back. I have been wanting to check out this place for a while now and finally got the opportunity. We called ahead and made reservations for our group of 7 and were seated right away when we arrived. Unfortunately their parking lot was full, but we were able to find street parking not too far away. First off, it was way way too hot and stuffy in there. They really need to work on their air conditioning, or at least get some fans in there to circulate some air. Second, the finishing on their tables makes them appear dirty. It was so sticky and uncomfortable. We tried cleaning it, but it is just the table finish. Even the napkins stuck to the table. Third, I had my one year old son with me and no one ever offered a high chair. We eventually found one on our own. Fourth, it took forever for the waitress to come see us and get our drink orders. 

In regards to the food, I had the pizza and it was decent. Nothing too amazing, but it was good and it was gone before we left. As a group we also tried their crepe, which was also tasty, but not worth the money in my opinion. The thing I loved the most about this place is its location and decor. It is located in an old house with a lot of charm. I love the bar area as well, maybe I'll try to come again sometime for drinks and an appetizer. Overall though, I was just not impressed..."}
{"text":"The food here is some of the best I've had in ages. Service can be hit or miss, but over all it's a nice place."}
{"text":"Charming, intimate, low-key, cozy, and solid food.   It feels like you are at a friend's home.  

There should be more places like this... like in Scottsdale.  Yes, there are real people living there that are constantly driving elsewhere but bitching about the lack of places to go to in the near vicinity.  Maybe there's someone who will take a hint..."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting with indoor and outdoor seating. I had dinner here and absolutely fell in love with the delicious food and romantic and quaint atmosphere. This is the place to enjoy a relaxing evening with your other half ,family, or friends. FYI try the truffle fries if you can... Dangerously delicious!"}
{"text":"Cibo is a pizza place that faithfully replicates the Italian experience of eating pizza. It is *not* a place that tries to do deep dish or thick(er) crusts like they do back in Chicago. Lou Malnati's will always rule the day in that department, with Gino's East running a close second (and Giordano's a close third!) 

But as far as straight-up Italian pizza is concerned, Cibo is as close as I've had since coming back from Naples.

First, their pesto salad: Excellent. Fresh greens, intensely flavored tomatoes, and sheets upon sheets of parmaggiano reggiano, which one can never have too much of. The basil tasted fresh, the olive oil had character, and they didn't spare on the pine nuts.

The pizza came soon after. We had the salsiccia con patate, a pizze bianche with potatoes, mozzarella and spicy sausage. Once again the ingredients were top notch and melded nicely, the sausage in particular having a great, complex flavor. The mozzarella melted perfectly and wasn't rubbery or greasy.

Ah, but the crust. It was thin and slightly charred on the bottom, like it should be. The dough had some \"give\", and chewing through the toppings brought an interior that was soft and had excellent texture. It should take two hands to eat this pizza. Very well done.

The interior of the restaurant can be loud, (very loud, depending on the intoxication of present company) and they're usually very busy. We had to wait 45 minutes for our table, and the weather outside was certainly threatening to pour at any moment (although it didn't). \"Urban\" also seems to have a different connotation, since the restaurant sure seems like it's in a low-density, suburban part of town (that happens to be a mile away from downtown Phoenix).

But the wait was worth it, and I'm giving a thumbs up to Yelp for drawing me to an excellent pizzeria."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in Phx. Comparable to PB, as many have noted, but without the wait. I love me some wood-fired pizzas and theirs is pretty legit. 

The decor is very homey and imtimate so it's suitable for date nights. They also have yummy crepes for dessert, so get that if you're not stuffed."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing sandwiches!  Today I had the Salsiccia and my friend had the Salmone.  We were both delighted.  I always enjoy the house salad as a side, but your other choices are fruit salad or potato chips."}
{"text":"This by far is the best pizza in Phoenix!
I can here with my brother for lunch and we were seated quickly. 

We sat outside on the patio near the tree which was so cute. We had a nice waiter who was very attentive.

I enjoyed a glass of red wine, during happy hour so it was reasonable and yummy! We each got our own pizza, I had mine on their gluten free crust. Let me tell you that was the best gluten free pizza crust I've had in my life. It was almost the same as eating regular pizza dough. We finished our meals off with a gf crepe which was phenomenal as well. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Spring is absolutely the PERFECT time of year to visit Cibo. I just can't imagine a better atmosphere than the set up they've got going on out on the lawn - picture intimate tables set up amidst the winding branches of mesquite trees dressed up in strings of white lights. Some may say clich√©; I say it's down right charming! 
Our party was seated pretty quickly (especially considering there were seven of us that showed up around 7:30 on a busy Friday night). Our waitress was awesome; answering our questions and giving us plenty of time to peruse the wine list and menu. Since pretty much everything looked tasty, we decided to order a variety and share. Most of us ended up splitting the Capricciosa, Salsicca, Pomodoro Fresco, and Salame pizzas, while one of our group opted for the Antipasto Speciale (because who can resist a dish that boasts a \"fantasy of olives\"). All were yummy, but the spicy salame had to be my favorite - they aren't kidding when they say \"spicy\". The Capricciosa was a close second, but, alas, had too many toppings to eat without a fork. The four pizzas, along with a generous quantity of vino, were plenty for six to share as a main dish, leaving just enough room for dessert. The Nutella crepe can't be beat, especially when embellished with a scoop of ice cream and the obligatory birthday candle (happy birthday Lisa!)."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my 2 visits here; both were during lunch. The place was packed inside so I decided to find a nice shady spot on the patio. Both meals I had were very good, the Apple salad was delicious! A 5-Star for me and served with some fresh baked bread (that the birds were demanding from me throughout the entire meal). The next day I tried the personal pizza; the crust was nice and crispy but to me the sauce seems a little too bland... maybe a 3-Star rating. I'm a big pizza fan so I'm quite picky with my pizza. 
Overall it was a nice place; great patio space with lots of nature (aka - attack of the tiny birds LOL). Parking is the biggest problem here... I had to circle the block 3 times looking for a curbside spot and I still had to walk about 3 minutes to the place."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant house tucked in a neighborhood with complimentary valet.  The food is delicious and definitely fills you up!  Lots to choose from as well as a great selection of beers and wines!  Can't wait to visit during warmer months and sit outside!  And they have a house cat!"}
{"text":"I stooped in for a Friday lunch with my boss. Parking was a bit of a pain as usual. The only table available was in direct sunlight and it kept us squinting though our entire conversation. 

The lunch menu consists entirely of sandwiches and salads. I was in the mood for some hot food, this along with my love affair of cheese lead me to try the hot multi cheese sandwich. I did not know what to expect as on the menu it sounded like a grilled cheese sandwich.  My arrived on a plate with a small side of Cesar like salad.  The salad had a nice topping of shaved Parmesan, and the sandwich had a generous amount of micro greens in addition to the cheese. The micro greens gave the sandwich a nice bitterness to contrast the fattiness of the cheese. The crunch and slight char taste of the brick oven chibata style bread tied the entire thing together.

My bosses meal came on a old chipped plate, as if the kitchen had run out of the nice contemporary plates. This was troublesome as it was against health code. His meal of a cold meat sandwich and fruit salads looked appetizing as well.  

I look froward to returning at night to try their pizza again."}
{"text":"Got lunch here yesterday while in town for work. Let me start by saying that the food was excellent. I ordered a margherita pizza and it was very very good. Also ordered a a nutella, strawberry, banana crepe and it was excellent as well. Now you're asking, why only three stars if the food was so good. Well, the service was pretty lackluster. It was pretty slow and apathetic overall. What really annoys me now is that the server asked me if I wanted whipped cream on my crepe and didn't mention that it was a $2 charge for it. It looks like they also charged $2 for strawberries which I think was included on the menu. My crepe ended up costing $14, which is a ripoff. For comparison sake, the pizza itself was $9. I shouldn't really care because I'm expensing it anyway but won't come back here just based on the principle."}
{"text":"The waits in Phoenix for premium restaurants are ridiculous.  Bianco is about a 3 hour wait, and while I'm not saying that it would have been wonderful, I was able to come to Cibo at around 5:30 and get in with my party of 4 no problem.  Walking in, your greeted by your host, right behind her, a bar, and then a glimpse of their coal burning pizza oven.  When I saw the pizza burning right next to the coal, I knew I was in the right place.  After a couple of cold Peroni's we ordered the buffalo mottzerlla with prosciutto and baguette.  It was wonderful.  The cheese is sourced from Italy, and I have to say it was the best I have ever had.  Stringy, soft, lightly salty goodness.  For our main courses, we shared the spicy pepperoni pie, while my in laws opted for a Greek pizza with artichoke hearts, feta, ham, and olives.  Both were good, but the pepperoni was a must have.  The crusts were really something special, with a nice crisp and a slight burn from the oven.  For dessert, we had some creaps.  Don't leave here with out having the nutella and bananna one, it was to die for and went really well with my last few sips of wine.  As we were leaving, there were about 5 couples waiting in the court yard.  I'd say to insure a seat, come down around 5:15 and you'll get in fo shiz."}
{"text":"Awful. This place pretends like it knows what's up but it is by far the worst pizza I have had in a long time. Crust was basically burnt (a couple burnt spots are OK but the whole thing was charred) which over powered any hint of other flavor the pizza may have had which it did not. The sauce, no flavor. The mozzarella, no flavor. NONE. Flavorless white stuff. The mushrooms, little to no flavor. There was nothing going on with this pizza at all but burnt flavor with a hint of flour. I was disappointed beyond belief but also not surprised as there is not many of any good pizza places in AZ. I only had two pieces and was done.  Not authentic at all, not even close.  This place is for the typical Arizonan who has not idea how food nor pizza is suppose to taste.  People just flock for the surroundings and pretend they know what they are doing.  Grazie's in Scottsdale is as close as it gets to real Neapolitan style pizza. 

I was also not impressed with the waitress. Let's just say she did not have a way with words.  Dumber than the pizza. 
My wife needed GF crust but the waitress told us they do not bake it on trays. So why the hell bother offer GF pizza? For the fakers? WTF? 

This place was so underwhelming it was subwhelming!! I  almost fell out of my chair with boredom. My tastebuds fell asleep on the first bit, put to sleep by the boring bland blah thing they call pizza.  

It was seriously disgusting and the texture of the pizza was on the slimy side. I have had Pizza all through Italy and there are not good ones there too but the not good ones were still good, the great ones were amazing. This place is a wannabe and a complete FAILURE! Just GROSS!!!

On a good note the salad was good and the hostess was great. Other than that I won't be spending my money here again despite the \"Atmosphere\" and apparent knowledge about pizza they claim to have by the looks of their menu. Blah. Honestly the owners and chefs need to visit Italy. You can't just make up this shit and pretend to know what you are doing. Have you guys ever tasted your pizza? Flavorless, no seasoning, no nothing with their pizza.  Just a complete borefest.  I believe pizza places including Biancos have no clue how pizza should taste. Ciao!


I WANT MY MONEY BACK ALONG WITH MY TIME WASTED TRYING THIS CRAP AND DEALING WITH A DUMB WAITRESS."}
{"text":"I love this place! Such a gem and the food is amazing!!! Definitely recommend if you're in town. Service is always amazing as well and it's just such a cute little spot."}
{"text":"My girlfriend Lisette had been harping on me for weeks to try this place, and she finally convinced me to leave the house and meet her at Cibo. When I pulled up to the restaurant to my pleasant surprise it was a quaint building reminding me of a house in Washington.
The food was delicious, and the service was quick and friendly. Although there was a larger party seated next to us, it did not distract from the over all experience. I was very pleased, and look forward to returning again!"}
{"text":"I could really love @cibocalgary but won't. The food is lovely enough but the service leaves something to be desired. It's a shame the staff didn't even make mention of a Happy Hour menu for their $5 Happy Hour pizza, otherwise I would go back. But they didn't, and I won't. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"I'd definitely hit Cibo again but I'd try to avoid a busy night. You're going to be hard pressed to find one of those though. Cibo's location, menu and ambiance will keep the locals coming. We hit a busy night and the service was not the best. They were out of quite a few items, so it made ordering a bit difficult. They also had some issues with their order system, so I'm sure that added to our servers headache.

That said, the food was tasty, the prices reasonable and the atmosphere is wonderful at Cibo. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Two stars because the food was good. However when asked to sit on one side of the patio we were told they weren't sitting that side, even though people were sitting there. We decided to go inside for dessert and sit at the bar. Once inside the employees were taking up the bar with their bags and food. We tried to find a spot and the employees simply stared at us until we left the bar and found a table. A note for the owner; if your paying customers want to sit at the bar the employees should move their bags and food to the back."}
{"text":"The pizza didn't really impress that much, it was just alright. You come here for the atmosphere. It was nice to seat outside withe lights on the tree."}
{"text":"Not only does Cibo great pizza and salads, but the outdoor seating is great!  The space is so relaxing and for a while you forget you are actually just blocks away from downtown! Highly recommend for lunch!  The valet parking is a huge plus also!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Within walking distance and offers gluten free crust."}
{"text":"We sat at the (very small) bar to wait for a table. There are maybe six seats,  so we couldn't be missed. No server or bartender acknowledged us or made eye contact.  We sat 8 minutes,  maybe 9, unbelievable.  I don't care how busy you are,  say hello.  Very  disappointed. Needless to say,  we left."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place several times  and loved it.. but recently I noticed something has changed..   The food and service has gone downhill  what happened ??     I ordered the sample meat appetizer well there was one slice of each of the meat and the rest mostly cherry tomato's not worth the price anymore..  We ordered 4 pizza's for the table .. they all were under cooked soggy  a real mess.. The taste was bland..  Our waitress seemed like she was somewhere else.. would disappear a lot.  It was almost impossible get water refills..  oh  I forgot mention ... the pizza had a burnt flour taste.. which means they need to clean there ovens..   Sorry Cibo I loved coming to your place but not worth it any more.."}
{"text":"This is currently our favorite place for date night.  I live in the north valley and don't get to downtown very often but if we have an occasion we definately go to Cibo.  My husband and I are trying to experience all the Best of Phoenix restaurants and so far this is our favorite.  

The pizza is amazing.  My husband especially enjoys the pasta specials.   They seat us promptly and the service is top notch.  The fresh mozzarella app is amazing.  

If only we lived closer we would go be there much more frequently."}
{"text":"One of the best patios down town. They have wonderful appetizers, anti pasta, and unique pizzas. Great place to hang out for the evening with friends. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"The ambience of this place is amazing. They had me at bistro lighting on the patio. They also had live music playing which was romantic and set the mood. I liked the calamari but wasn't a fan of the pizza. I ordered the diavolo pizza and anytime I tried picking it up it would just fall apart. Also my crust was burnt."}
{"text":"Been to Cibo a couple times, but not for several years. Took the hubster for his first time last night and was slightly worried it may not live up to how much I had hyped it up. Sometimes restaurants, over the years, stop paying attention to detail and loose their oomph. Omg. Not Cibo. Everything was so delicious. We had the pesto salad to start. A little bland for my taste, but very fresh tasting and the fried potatoes, while a little weird sounding in a salad, added a yum savoriness. Hubby loved it. We then ordered the Diavola pizza and the Tartufata. We are both big time red sauce believers. Very rarely will we order a pizza that doesn't have red sauce. The Diavola had a fresh delicious crushed tomato sauce that was just perfect. The spicy salami was perfect, not greasy or too fatty tasting (which I still love but maybe more on a charcuterie). The Tartufata was the white pizza. Mushrooms, procuitto, mozzarella... and... truffle oil. TRUFFLE.OIL. Omg. So good. Both pizzas' crust was perfect. To end the super healthy feast, we decided we would go out with a bang and get the mascarpone and Nutella crepe with ice cream (because obv). Life changing. The mascarpone smooths out the Nutella perfectly. Not too sweet, but still rich. Anyway, I want another crepe for breakfast and if Cibo was closer right now, I would order two. No shame in my game."}
{"text":"I've been trying to perfect the neapolitan pizza on my own time, so when I first went here, I of course went for the Margherita... Of course I have since tried many of their pies, but I want to focus on the most pristine of their pies, as if you don't have that nailed, you have nothing.

Component wise this pizza was top notch.  The crust was leopard spotted, perfect hydration for their oven, salted cornichone... Just perfect.

The sauce was excellent.  Not sweet, fresh, tangy, bomb.

Their mozzarella is milky goodness, and they throw the fresh bail on last after it's cooked. Magnifico!

People go around talking about their favorite pizza spots and it always boils down to some certain pizza configuration; however, a true pizza person must see through this fluff in order to see the true greatness.

Cibo has the right oven, the right temperature, the right wood, the right bakers ratios in use on their dough, fresh ingredients, and elegant flavors.  Don't get fooled into this pie or that.  Get into perfection.  Get into Cibo."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Cibo,
I used to live downtown and remember when it opened. So quaint, so delicious. I live in the North valley now and miss my walk over to Cibo. Anytime I head downtown I make a stop by Cibo! Try it, you will love it!"}
{"text":"As another reviewer noted you can NOT get the pizza for lunch. Noteworthy because that was what I was after. However, the Vegetariano Sandwich was delicious! VEGAN friendly if you order it without cheese. 

The chef will not allow an extra ramekin of marinara sauce to be brought out after the food. Apparently the sauce will taste different if it is not cooked with the food. Ok. 

My boyfriend ordered the Parmesan sandwich and it looked quite tasty. We both had the house salad which was good. The house chips are Miss Vicky's and brought to you sealed in their original bag. The patio is so beautiful on a nice, cool day with plenty of shade provided by the over-sized umbrellas and trees. I enjoyed a great lunch complete with tiny birds and a glass of white wine."}
{"text":"Food and people are all great.  I recommend sitting outside is the seating inside is a little cramped and very loud."}
{"text":"Not all its cracked up to be. The pizza was mediocre at best (we had three pizzas and tried 6 different styles). To be fair to the restaurant, the appetizers (especially the burrata) was fresh and of quality. Additionally, the dessert special (tiramisu) was above average - though a bit cream heavy. Atmosphere was probably the highlight, being tucked away in a cozy home with outdoor seating that would serve as a good date spot."}
{"text":"Cute venue and service was okay, not stellar but not the worst.

Started off with Antipasta plate: too much shallots, not enough cheese & olives, which is the whole point of antipastas, right??
Capriossa pizza: ok, but the crust was soggy and the ingredients weren't carefully placed so some slices had nothing but red sauce. 
Crepe: The ONLY reason this was a 3 and not 2 star review was the crepe. It was delicious. We had strawberries & nutella with a side of ice cream."}
{"text":"Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco have a tie for the best pizza in town and best caprese in town. Less wait times and more seating at Cibo though, better parking too! Very attentive service and the owners are always around to greet you. Save some room for dessert: Nutella Cr√™pe with fresh strawberries and chocolate drizzle is a-maz-ing!!!"}
{"text":"Cute place for a date night! There's a bit of a wait even at 9PM on a Friday night. There's live music outside, and there is seating outside and inside for whichever you prefer. There's also a couch for you to sit while waiting! :) 

At first I was slightly skeptical of ordering a pizza with no sauce, but I am so glad I tried it!! They have a wide variety of pizza to choose from and I wish I can try them all. Although, I wish there were more options for pasta...

Overall great experience, very good food, romantic and cute ambiance -- Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pies in town.  I love the tartufata and the salami calzone is AMAZING. I never want to share my calzone.  Delicious and fresh!  it's been here awhile, if you haven't checked it out , you are missing out!!!"}
{"text":"We had been to Cibo in Regent Square several times before they closed and we enjoyed dining there.  We recently noticed that they had reopened, so we decided to try out this version.  Brought our own wine and started off with salads.  I had the romaine with Grana Padano and my wife had the mesclun with goat cheese subbing for their usual gorgonzola.  Both were very good.  
Next we each had a small/half order of their pastas.  I had the bucatini alla matriciana and my wife had a daily special that was \"little pockets\" of pasta stuffed with ricotta in a creme sauce, whose name escapes me.  Both were very tasty although the buccatini was hard to twirl making it a bit challenging to eat.  After finishing her pasta, my wife suggested we order another small order of her pasta and share it, which we did.  Usually we end up taking home leftovers, but these small/half orders were much to our liking.  
After sharing her second order, we even had room for desert, and we ordered the salted caramel custard to share.   It came with hazelnut shortbread cookies and a Port Wine sauce.  Desert reminded us of creme br√ªl√©e, which we love, without the caramelized top with a tasty port wine sauce.  The cookies were so good we bought a dozen to take home.  Service was even better than the food.  
Our server was very polished and attentive, and knowledgable about the preparations and ingredients.  Noise level was low.  
The only concern was the lack of patrons.  We arrived on a Friday evening at 7:00 and from the time we got there until we left only three tables were busy.  Hope word gets around and business picks up or there may not be a BYOB option in Regent Square for long."}
{"text":"Brilliant service from our waitress late on a Friday night. She was very prompt and attentive but gave us space too. The aperol spritz was delicious! Had the happy hour pizzas ($5 after 10pm) and they were fast, fresh and tasty! Will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Cafe, Hip
Price: Reasonable
Service: Excellent
Food: Loved it

Guido you do great work! I ordered the Rutica Bianco Pizza. I love fresh arugula . Prosciutto was just right. I'm in town on business from Chicago and dined by myself! I felt very comfortable and welcomed. 

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Napoli pizza places in Phoenix. Their margherita pizza is amazing and caprese salad comes not only with big mozzarella and tomatoes but also cherry tomatoes and mozzarella balls, adding to the variety. It's enough to be shared by four people in addition to a meal."}
{"text":"What can I say about CIBO that hasn't been said before?...it has so many elements that make a great place to hang out and eat with friends...

* Good Service and courteous hosts
* Delicious fresh tasting food  that  scream  I am somehow good for you 
* Crepes that are to die for .. how can you resist...
* Brick Oven Pizza 
* Edgy Decor  dripping with hipness
* Great reflection of the downtown feel 

Great for meeting after work , taking mom out to eat , wine and pizza with friends , downtown close to events

Go ..you will love it   enuf said"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Phoenix, bar none. Amazing, life changing pies. You must eat here. 

Other reasons why I like it:
- cheap, good bottles of wine
- dog friendly
- light rail accessible
- romantic vibe (but not too romantic, totally ok for just casual dining with friends)
- friendly staff
- free of Old Town Scottsdale douchery
- desserts with nutella
- fresh & often local ingredients
- no ridiculous wait times like Bianco (usually 30 min or less during peak times)

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Cool art! Excellent service."}
{"text":"Always fabuloso!!!! The romantic ambiance, the flavors, the vino, the service!!!! Local gem"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed by any of my experiences here. The food is amazing and the owners are so nice! If this spot was closer to home I would be there all the time."}
{"text":"So I got married downtown at the Icehouse last month - prior to that I have to say I had actually visited downtown Phoenix zero times.  I live in Scottsdale/PV so never thought there was a reason to go \"downtown\".  Boy was I wrong.   

While vetting out a location for our rehearsal dinner we dined at a few cool spots downtown, one of which was Cibo. Coming from Chicago I consider myself a pizza snob/aficionado so it takes a little bit to impress me.  I was drooling over Cibo's menu before we even arrived, and they did not disappoint.  First of all, the restaurant and patio are just freaking adorable. I had no idea Phoenix offered neighborhoods such as the one Cibo is located in. Rows of cute bungalow homes just like back home! And located in one on the corner, there is Cibo!  What a romantic, special setting.  

On my first visit, the server was knowledgeable about the menu, ingredients, as well as the vino.  I like that they use local and organic ingredients mixed with authentic Italian items that are imported and impossible to duplicate.  We started with the Ostia salad which I am now obsessed with and have tried unsuccessfully to duplicate at home.  The chickpea dressing was so well balanced, and the crispy parsnips on top were such a creative was to add crunch.  We ordered both a red and a white pizza, because we just couldnt decide. The pizza crust was just the right mix of crunch and chew, and the toppings and cheese were fresh and flavorful.

Ahhhhh and the Nutella Crepes. So simple yet so divine. Warm crepes stuffed with Nutella with a scoop of ice cream. Hard to find anything wrong with that.

So midway through my 3rd glass of vino the decision was made - we were going to host our wedding rehearsal dinner here.  We asked them to show us the location, which could not have been more perfect. Private parties can be hosted in what is basically a guest house converted into a party room. It was just too cute for words, needed little decoration, and has a bar, private bathroom, and a great patio. They told us they were planning to host small weddings in the space as well.

The service that I received with regard to our rehearsal was great. Michelle was quick to respond to my questions and I really appreciated her guidance on the menu as we had a few vegan/vegetarians in our party. 

The value of hosting our dinner there was fantastic.  Our $20/pp package included house salads, a trio of bruschetta choices, a variety of pizzas, and those Nutella crepes I had been dreaming about.   To keep costs in check we decided to serve soft drinks and a selection of a couple of beers and wines for our guests to chose from . All in all, with gratuity and drinks included the bill was around $1000 for about 30 people, which I felt was a great value. The bartender and wait staff made sure everyones waters and drinks were full, and the timing of the service was great. 

Our friends and family raved about the location and food, and had a blast enjoying the beautiful evening weather on the private patio.

Cibo will always hold great memories of a fantastic night with friends and family, and I look forward to my next visit to this little treasure. I have yet to go to Bianco despite all I have read, but honestly would have a hard time justifying waiting in line and dealing with all the hoopla involved with dining there when I know Cibo is around the corner and well deserving of my business."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and my opinion is that Cibo deserves 2 stars at best. My principal observation is that their recipes do not appear to have been constructed by someone with professional training. I believe that Cibo's popularity is due primarily to being in a great location, having low priced food and being BYOB.

For our second visit, one person in our party returned her Tuna Puttanesca Pasta entree, never having done so in her life.  She felt badly about doing so, but it was very off in flavor and appearance.  Large chunks of unseared rare tuna on top of a bed of warm pasta and capers.  I ordered the Pasta Cibo and the sauce was very thick-gluey and the sausage almost tasted as if it had been boiled and then thrown in on top of the pasta.  In contrast, the beans and greens appetizer was delicious and perfectly prepared.

Also, in our party of 6, 3 ordered beans and greens (from the appetizer menu), two ordered salads as starters, and one ordered soup. They brought the 3 of us the beans and greens first, while the salad/soup orderers sat and watched us eat. After clearing our plates (30 minutes in), they brought the other 3 their salads and soup. Similarly, those who ordered pasta entrees got their plates about 5 minutes before those who ordered the non- pasta entrees.  The whole night was a \"don't wait for me, go ahead and get started before your food gets cold\" experience.

Cibo is not an \"I'll never go back there again\" restaurant, but there are probably 20 better options in the East End."}
{"text":"Finally made it back to one of my favorite patios in Phoenix for a delicious lunch! 

We enjoyed the Sardegna (baby spinach salad) with grilled shrimp and a Vegetariano  Saltinocca (sandwich) hot. 

The salad was absolutely perfect. Wouldn't change a thing. The shrimp was perfectly grilled. Plenty of candied walnuts and goat cheese with fresh strawberries and spinach. 

The Vegetariano was very good as well. Could have used a punch of flavor with a pesto or some kind of sauce. 

Great service and perfect seating on the patio engulfed by the big tree. 
Thanks Cibo!"}
{"text":"I love Cibo! It's so great. The service may be a little bit slow when they are super busy, but it's definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is some of the best in Phoenix. The ambiance is also a huge plus as it has a romantic setting. My only issue is the wait, but it's expected given the size of the restaurant. Come on a weekend night for live music!"}
{"text":"After so many rave reviews of this place, we decided to give Cibo's a try. In a nutshell - the most underwhelming and flavorless meal we've had in a very long time. We should have anticipated what kind of meal this was going to be, by the dirty side plates brought to our table.

We had the Ostia salad - \"Romaine hearts tossed with our homemade chick pea dressing, topped with oven roasted herbed croutons, shaved pecorino romano, crispy parsnips and black pepper.\" Our romaine lettuce was spoiled, and rotting, the dressing had absolutely  ZERO flavor, and the salad overall just generally lacked any flavor at all. We then had the Procida pizza -\"Mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, asian pears, chopped arugula, goat cheese and black pepper.\" It wasn't bad, but it was just - eh. Again, lacked flavor. The goat cheese had no flavor whatsoever. 

Our service was fine, but the girl who cleared our plates was very unprofessional. We let her know (and showed her) our rotted salad leaves, and she just replied with - \"Oh...sorry.\" That was it. Also, as she was clearing our plates, she put others' dirty plates on our table as she tried to stack ours. At that point, we knew our complaint was going to fall on deaf ears. 

We've been to just about every pizza joint in the valley, and this was subpar, to say the least. I have no idea what all the hullaballoo is all about. We will definitely not be going back, which is disappointing, because we truly had high hopes for Cibo's after all the amazing reviews."}
{"text":"Good grief where do I start. This place has such delicious pizza and I love their dessert options. Did you know they have a very dog friendly patio too???!!! What more could an animal loving, pizza loving- person ask for! I also have to give BIG kudos to the owner for giving me a donation for the animals on top of having delish food and great customer service. I'm a big animal fundraiser and the fact that he was so giving made my heart happy while the food made my stomach happy. The staff is so friendly too. Love this place and I will be back for more, you need to visit with your fur kids and tell them I sent you!"}
{"text":"A month ago, I had no idea Cibo even existed. Hidden in the alleyways of Downtown Phoenix, nestled on the corner of a residential street, it can be easy to miss. But I am so glad I was invited to a friend's birthday dinner to celebrate here and uncovered the charming spot. 

The place is actually huge, with beautiful string lights decorating a romantic outdoor patio and an interior that mimics your favorite cozy Italian joint, there is plentiful seating to enjoy the wonderful ambiance. The wait staff that served out table of 12-15 was so kind and extremely helpful. Our food was ready quickly and the pizzas I tasted were quite good. A little burnt dough on the bottom and very thin crust, but that wasn't enough to turn us off to the menu. Good portion sizes as well. They also brought my friend a crepe with an ice cream scoop on top as a free birthday treat. 

I'd love to come back here and sit outdoors, experience the live music, and try more of the menu. Well done Cibo!"}
{"text":"The food is great, fresh and very tasteful... the service, not so much. As another person reviewed here, the wait staff takes your order, asks if you are ordering dessert and then takes the check... No \"how is your food, can I bring you more water, would you like parm cheese w/your pizza\". Nothing!!!

I've never been to a restaurant that has that much LACK of service, its amazing how many people actually come back for more bad service, I guess its because of the food, which I can understand. We had Divola pizza, great fresh cheese, salami and fresh tomatoes. For dessert we ordered a freshly made crepe, w/ marscarpone cheese and nutella.. it was heavenly!

The owners, an older couple, are very friendly and very into their place. I guess someone should complain to them about their wait staff."}
{"text":"Romantic, great Italian food, excellent live music, what could be better?--oh, Crepes Suzette!"}
{"text":"best neopolitan pizza i've had in the states. The chef i believe is from caserta which is pretty cool. this is one of the only places i don't mind waiting to get seated and personally i like their food better than pizzeria bianco."}
{"text":"Reboot Technology Services

I have taken both my laptops and cpu's to Drew.  His turn around time is quick and the work done is always top notch.  My computers are VERY old and he keeps them running.  He has a back-up service as well.  I would not take any of my computers anywhere else."}
{"text":"Cibo is a great place to bring someone who doesn't know about it already you'll score some cool points for being in the know. I love the concept of a restaurant set in a historic house that in itself is cool in its own right  and the food is tasty but the service is horrible! The waiter comes to your table takes down your order and is never to be seen again till your done with your food. Grrrrr! Despite the bad service I still come back for more because i'm obsessed with the bruschetta here.  The appetizer comes with three different types of bruschetta tomato, cheese with prosciutto, and some weird bean stuff  weird but tasty. The pizza is pretty good too but I think the sauce tastes a little like ragu...really :)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch
Was bummed that they don't have pizza for lunch
Poo

So instead I got a sandwich and it was ok
The bread was tasty
Eh

I'm so bummed they didn't have pizza at lunch
:("}
{"text":"Went to Cibo's for dinner. The atmosphere was great, the waitress was awesome but, my pizza was burned black on one side and about a quarter way on the bottom. I would probably give it another chance since the appetizers were delicious and the wine selection was good."}
{"text":"Really good. Cute place, nice ambiance. I had their very thin crust pizza which was lovely and my friend had a sandwich that she enjoys regularly - this was my first visit. Everything appears clean, service was prompt and friendly and not overly hovering.   Will definitely return. Nice lunch place!"}
{"text":"Mellow. We had a friend in from out of town that suggested we go here. It was way less stressful than one of the last times I was here. They now have valet (shared with to the Vig downtown). The weather was perfect so we sat outside with no wait. Great patio if the weather permits. However we got eaten alive by mosquitoes so bring bug spray. 

We tried the calamari, salad, pizza, and a pesto pasta special. Everything was good but nothing really stuck out hence the rating. Everything has cheese as the main focus on each dish so might not be a good pick for vegans. Overall, we enjoyed our mellow night out of the house."}
{"text":"eat anything and everything here.
Best Pizza in the Valley, hands down. 
Wonderful wine selection, great happy hour."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and outdoor vibe. Could use more outdoor seating, but all in all, a good place."}
{"text":"Cibo has been one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix for quite some time.  It love the space, particulalry when I can eat outside.  The pizza is always good.  I'm a big fan of the Rustica.  There is a good wine list, and overall it is a place that I like to sit with friends and hang out.

Unfortunately, I can't give Cibo four or five stars becuase the service continues to be awful.  I was in the restaurant last Saturday night, it was busy and there seemed to be a complete melt down with the bar staff and the wait staff.  The Bar tender refused to serve us.  She sent us to a drab coach house in the back of the restaurant.  The Coach House did not have the full wine list available.  Really, there was not much available.  The bar tender kept dissapearing, he ran out of glasses, it was too crowded, noisy...I expect much more from a restaurant.  After we were finally seated, things improved.  

I think I'll avoid Cibo on the weekends until it can work out its service issues."}
{"text":"Very good spot near downtown. We got two pizzas (margherita and diavola), plus their meatballs, and the burrata with prosciutto and tomatoes. I thought everything was really good -- the pizza was floppier than I'd typically want, but still very good. The meatballs were probably the standout, although the burrata/prosciutto/tomatoes were excellent as well."}
{"text":"I had read Jason C's review of this place. A detailed account of why Cibo = heart break for him. Funny, sad, etc. But I thought I'd put a different twist on it since I'm not looking to leave anyone any time soon. I had a lunch meeting here instead (sorry Jason). 

We decided to eat outside on the patio and I was immediately reminded of that nuisance that is Phoenix restaurant misters in the summer. We had to move tables cause it would have been hard to have a lunch meeting, take notes, etc with our papers soaked! But really that shouldn't be a slam against Cibo per say because I know sooo many restaurants use those wasteful, ineffective, highly annoying devices.

Anyways...once we moved tables I really loved the ambience. The patio is gorgeous. I ate under a big tree that looked like you could climb in it, read a book, and be perfectly content. 

I had a salad (I can't remember the name now) with apples, candied walnuts, and gorgonzola cheese. It was delish!! The iced tea was amazing as well. Our server was really pleasant and not over attentive or too chatty, as she recognized that we were there to talk shop. 

I didn't get to poke around inside too much. But a restaurant in an old home seems to work well for Phoenix. 

We went at about 1:30pm and there was a small crowd. It seemed to be about the perfect time to hit them up. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Came here after my friend Seano suggested that we try it out after Una Pizza down the road said a 1 hour wait for a table. Seano can be a bit hit and miss with his restaurant suggestions but he hit the nail on the head with Cibo. 

The dishes are served in portions (similar to tapas) so you are meant to order a few and share them amongst yourself. We ordered 4 dishes and 2 pizzas and that was more than enough for the 4 of us! 

Nice setting as well and it's big enough that I don't think you would have to worry about booking a table beforehand."}
{"text":"I'm really torn on how many stars to give Cibo so I'm sticking in the middle  Went there on a Tuesday night for the very first time and I absolutely fell in love with the ambiance outside.  The outside seating totally deserves 5 stars, but thats about the only 5 star I can give, if it weren't for the wonderful atmosphere I would've only given 2 stars.  

After being seated we had to wait a while for our server to come over to the table.  Not sure if he was new or just having an off night but I was not impressed with him.  I was actually jealous of the tables around us and their interactions with wonderful servers.  We explained to the server it was our first time eating there and he just started pointing to stuff and spouting off about all sorts of different pizzas, meats, cheeses, wines, etc...It was a little overwhelming and he lost me.  When we were  ready to order we had to first flag him down and interrupt his conversation with another employee.  He took our order and quickly walked away without even asking if we wanted  anything to drink.  We originally planned on getting a bottle of wine but after my boyfriend had to walk inside the building the get some service and a drink we decided against the bottle.  Very disappointing!   I'm also somewhat glad we didn't order the bottle of wine because while we were still sitting there enjoying our dinner and conversation they started clearing off our entire section and staring at us as if we were keeping the restaurant open.  Keep in mind the place was still open for 30 more minutes.  I honestly felt rushed and that I couldn't enjoy myself.  If we didn't have to wait so long, flag down our server or go in the restaurant ourselves to order a drink we may have actually finished our meal a lot sooner.  

We opted for the sausage pizza, which was good but not the best.  The mozzarella cheese was delicious and tasted very fresh, as was the crust.  But other than that I really wasn't all that impressed.  

I didn't hate the place nor did I love it.  I'd probably give it one more chance and hope that I had better service the next time around."}
{"text":"you'll notice from my review history that i'm not hard to please. maybe somewhat hard to impress into speaking in superlatives, but it takes a lot for me to leave a bad review. Looking at the other reviews for this restaurant I see a lot of \"amazings\" and equally as many 'just okays\" to \"wtfs\".. and that's really all it is. this place is debilitatingly inconsistent. 

I've been here several times and the food is definitely overpriced but it's always been okay (neither exceptional nor offensive 'italian' fare), and the service is always lovely (thats what the points are for in this review).


Went on NYE for dinner (table of four) and I know what youre thinking \"it's a busy holiday, cut them some slack!\"

No. I've been there on busier fridays, and there's just no excuse for what was getting churned out of the kitchen. the wait staff is not to blame, i am entirely blaming the kitchen (and didnt undertip to punish the wait staff who were not to blame)

let's just get to the shitshow. 

arancini and lamb meatballs were fine. The lamb (i love lamb, so it's not like i can't \"handle\" the gamey taste) was not fresh. Arancini is very hard to screw up, and they didn't. Neither is worth the 15 dollar price tag ( 4 arancinis in some forgettable sauce, and 7 lamb meatballs that were smaller than a teaspoon.. baffling). 

Now at this point of the meal i was pretty happy because it's NYE, i was with my friends, and the ambiance and wait staff were killing it. it was overpriced but average food, which is what I already knew about this place. 

the mains is where they completely lost us. our friend's pasta was good. It wasn't 25 dollar good, but it was a comfort dish (I know i keep bringing up the price but i eat at this price point frequently and it was more like a 15/person quality of food). 

the two pizzas were both dry and not well seasoned (pear pizza and the one with mulitple meats) and the special, bison cheek (which is one of my favorite meats) was literally inedible. I always take a takeout box, i literally left my entire meal at the table in the box except the polenta which i ate, and the few bites of bison snd greens that were in my belly. 

The biscuit was inedibly dry (and I mean that, I love bread and will even eat stale bread, this biscuit was burnt and heavily over salted... which is something a salt lover like me has never said). the bison cheek was cooked well in terms of doneness but the marinade was horrific. it was very sweet (I like a mix of sweet/meat so it isn't that i'm not adventurous), the greens were underseasoned and seemed old (maybe just overcooked). I had to cut the outsides of the bison off to at least try and eat the meat less affected by the sugar they must've marinaded it in, but.... it was too far in. It was permeated into the entire chunk of meat and that bummed me out because i was famished and had saved up for this meal. very hard to screw up bison for me, but they did. i ate the polenta (hard to screw up, and they didnt) that hadn't touched the sugar meat and that was basically my meal, plus a teaspoon meatball and an arancini.

\"Well Ayla, why didn't you tell them at the restaurant instead of being an asshole on the inernet\"

Great question, Internet! The time between the first entree being dropped (mine) and the last (pasta) was almost 25 minutes, and the time between our appetizers being cleared and my entree being dropped was over 20 minutes as well. Now, we were in no rush as it's NYE, but we had sat and ordered by half 8 and were not out by 11, it was ridiculous. it was not even crowded and it is not the wait staff's fault. The expo or someone in the kitchen was being a stone cold disaster (I used to work on a kitchen line, you know when the mess ups is from front or back of house). 

Since it had been about 40 minutes between cleared apps and my friend getting her pasta, they should have refired the rest of our entrees or at least kept them warm. no, they dropped one plate, then dropped two pizzas, and the pasta with 5ish minutes or so between each of those things. It was baffling. the prospect of them firing up another shit meal for me after 40 minutes of not eating anything (rude to start eating until everyone has their plates when your party is only 4), i wasn't going to risk it i just wanted to dip ASAP and never return.

It sucks too because the wait staff, ambiance, and the menu on paper are so awesome, and this place is like two blocks from where I live. further, the presentation is lways great, but the food underneath it absolutely blekh. I don't see myself hemorrhaging my hard earned cash on this place ever again. In a town with so, so many amazing culinary options i will never understand how the hell this place stays open in such a prime location. they need to elevate the quality of their food to justify the price, or hopefully they'll be gone by the end of the year. i've given it so many chances and Saturday was just the straw that broke the camel's back."}
{"text":"I love the pizza, so far this is what I kept  coming back during happy hour.  Basil tomato and Wild Boar is my favorite. Good thing this is close to my place and can run whenever I crave. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Over priced and not the best pizza in the Phoenix Metro Area. Think of it as this, Pizza Patron has better pizza than this place does. Their pizzas taste like tomato paste thrown on top of a tortilla with expensive toppings. Not worth it."}
{"text":"This place is so average!!!! I don't understand. I guess it has good happy hour deals and a good location but the food is so unbelievably average, ESPECIALLY if you're looking for gluten free or dairy free options. The service also sucks. Do yourself a favour and go to una or blaze pizza. Both close in proximity and incredibly better choices than this poor excuse for a pizza place. The manager literally laughed and made a face after he asked how our food was and we told him the GF/DF pizza option wasn't good. He said \"ooh yeah that wouldn't be good.... our GF/DF dough is frozen and not very tasty.\" WHO SAYS THAT ABOUT THEY'RE OWN RESTAURANT"}
{"text":"What a great spot! Awesome fresh made Italian food from their freshly picked salads to their delicious maple/ Neapolitan food fired pizzas yummmm!! Thus downtown spot is well worth the drive for us, I love their patio, lush with green plants and dim string lights just makes your dining experience even more romantic."}
{"text":"Much better than Pizzeria Bianco!  Cibo is a great date spot."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The staff is friendly and very informative . The food .. We'll ... It's amazing!! EVERYTIME I've been here it's busy, but the efficiency is remarkable. Our server Collin had the entire patio and he didn't miss a beat . I highly recommend you come on down on a Friday night sit on the patio and enjoy the environment and the live music ."}
{"text":"We sat out on the patio for a beautiful afternoon lunch. Sandwiches were tasty. Service was slightly on the slow side. Limited menu, thought there would be more choices for lunch. Most menu items were repeated but you could choose hot or cold. We enjoyed ourselves and would recommend this place for a nice lunch downtown any time."}
{"text":"Cibo has fantastic wood fired pizzas, sandwiches and a to die for antipasto platter (love their desserts, too).  The setting is perfect...it reminds me of many, many restaurants in cities like Portland, OR...it is in an old converted house in one of the historic districts.  This is a great place for outside seating.  They have tables set up in the yard and the trees are all brightly lit with wrapped lights (think little white XMas lights).  The only downside for Cibo (and I can't begrudge them this) is that it is frequently really crowded, particularly on weekends.  If it weren't so crowded I would eat here all of the time!"}
{"text":"Very cozy place, its almost a hole in the wall. We started with the meatball appetizer and OMG, it was just a perfect blend of meat and suace. 
Staff were super friendly, we had their Tuesday special and I do no remember the name, but it was great. Well not as good as the meatballs but still good."}
{"text":"Such a fun date spot!! Great for lunch, too! Patio is super romantic at night with the twinkle lights. Pizzas can be made 1/2 & 1/2 if you can't decide between two flavors... I couldn't! The caprese salad was delicious. Mozzarella, tomatoes & basil were super fresh. Great start to a perfectly fired pizza. Yum!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING food and ambiance-- Had the proscuitto pizza and it was to die for. 

The Limoncello was fantastic, too! Definitely a trendy spot to check out in downtown Phx"}
{"text":"In town for a very short trip when a local recommended Cibo.  It never ceases to amaze me that Phoenix is right there with NY & CT when it comes to pizza.  There has to be something in the water in that town.

The spot is in a nice residential area.  I was seated immediately.  I really love the flexibility with the pizza.  Unlike other pizza joints, they allowed me to split my pizza so that I could try different flavors.  I went with a 1/2 Salsiccia - tomato sauce, sausage and mozzarella and 1/2 Tartufata - mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, white mushrooms and a drizzle of white truffle oil after the pizza is cooked.  It is everything it had be billed. 

Service was attentive.  Price was very reasonable for what I got.  Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Great location and very good food. If you're looking for a patio restaurant in central phoenix, I'd highly recommend it - perfect for a date or a group of ~10-15 people (though if you're going at prime time, you'll probably want to call ahead)."}
{"text":"The place you go to when you are not in the mood to deal with the surly crowds at Bianco.  Great setting, good pizza, and excellent desserts."}
{"text":"What can I say about Cibo besides... yum!

This quaint little house styled restaurant is a great hidden gem in the Downtown Phoenix area. With it's warm and romantic patio ambiance, who would not want to relax here at any point in time as long as it is not summertime... ha. When you walk in, you get that great sense of home.

However, the best part of Cibo is definitely not the decor or ambiance. it is that food. Their appetizers are a so very delicious way to begin your culinary experience here. Then when it is time to pick your main course, just start with the top and move down the list. I can guarantee that once you've eaten here you'll keep coming back for more. I know I do.

Their wines are not too pricey either which is great... especially if you can take advantage of their happy hour. it is a valued place for sure. thank you for making every experience a good one... that's why I keep on coming home to you!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner by myself. I went on a Friday night at 8. I had to wait maybe 20 minutes,  but it went quickly. I can tell this is a place I would come to often with my husband if we lived here, but I'm from indiana. I ordered a root beer and margharita pizza. It was ready really fast. It came to the table very hot and topped with huge basil leaves. The cheese was sparse-the way it should be. The cheese and sauce were of excellent quality.  The crust left something to be desired so I didn't eat the edges. It tasted like toast. Not bad, just not ideal. My bill was $14.50. I would definitely go back.

A side note/caution: don't walk there by yourself. It is not a well lit area and there were a few times I thought I should not be alone. This however, should not reflect poorly on the establishment."}
{"text":"Planned a visit back to the Valley and Cibo was my first stop after getting off the plane. The atmosphere was the first thing that impressed me. You walk up to the beautifully lit and cozily warmed outdoor seating space and either wait or get your table. We had a 5 minute wait. Not bad for a Friday night. We shared a bottle of the wine on special and ordered the Il Tagliere to share. This app is highly recommended. It was my favorite part of the meal. A wooden charcuterie board was placed in front of us filled with cured meats, olives, cheese, artichokes, walnuts, and apple. Perfect! 

I also ordered the Siena pizza. I was generally satisfied with the flavor of the crust, cheese, and toppings, however, they added the large slices of spek and zucchini after cutting the pizza which made it difficult to maneuver. Cibo is a winner. I'd be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Perfect place to take a date. Beautiful atmosphere with a laid back vibe. I was Intensely listening to her speak.. Until I took a bite of that divalo pizza... Ooooooi that sauce! It was love at first taste. Forgot I was trying to impress a lady.. completely ignored her for roughly 5 minutes and made love to that pie. 

I had an app too. No idea what it was called but I it was fantastic! Cream filled mozz ball with tomatoes, bread and of course balsamic reduction. 

If I lived closer I'd be broke! Nough said."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about CiBO! I loved the atmosphere, the pizza was delicious (nice crispy crust with a wood fired flavor, premium toppings) and service was great. We ordered the grilled veggie plate appetizer, and though I wished it was served hot and not slightly on the cold side, it was surprisingly delicious. The drizzle of balsamic totally made the dish! 

Spring for the extra $2 for the balsamic onions on your pizza, you won't be disappointed (and I don't even like onions)!"}
{"text":"You can't live in Phoenix and not eat at Cibo!  This is one of my favorite retaurants in the State.  It's in an old house in a historic part of downtown, tucked away in an old nieighborhood, and the food is incredible.  All of their sandwiches are perfectly done and flavorful and the service is always first class.  Very easy to get in and out quickly, and with a full belly, during the lunch hour!"}
{"text":"If you cannot get into Pizza Bianco, come over to Cibo, or come to Cibo first and enjoy the great pizza, sandwiches, and soups made here. The ambiance here is great.  It occupies an old home built in the early 1900's and a patio that makes you feel like home. Went one Tuesday Pasta night which used to occur weekly and still does I hope and had the best pasta since my trip to Italy.  A hidden gem in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner the other night with some friends who had been before. I love the look of this quaint little restaurant with it's twinkle lights decorating the tree stumps and greenery. I love their outdoor seating out front - it makes a great atmosphere. 

The staff were nice and fairly attentive. It's got a nice laid back vibe. 

We started off with a Caprese salad and I think that's why I rated this place just average. For me an Italian restaurant shouldn't ruin a caprese salad but this one was just not good. Something was seriously missing - maybe a little balsamic drizzle but it lacked all of the fresh flavors I was hoping for. The pizza I ordered on the other hand was so good. I was really bummed I couldn't bring the rest home (headed to a concert after dinner). It was the Di Norte and had a nice kick to it so you if you like a little spice in your life this is the thing to order. 

I would come back here again but it's not at the top of my list. Great if you want to sit outdoors and enjoy the nice temperature and good conversations."}
{"text":"This rating is based on an average from two different visits. During one visit, I went for dinner and had the most delicious pizza! The charm of this place makes you feel like you are distant from reality. The dessert wine I ordered at the end was the icing on the cake! 

However, on my next visit, I sat outside on the patio for brunch and it was not quite as great of an experience. The weather was great, but the sun was shining pretty bright so I am guessing that is why our server only came by to get our order, drop it off, and bring our tab. No refills, no feedback requested on the meal, nothing. She was a very sweet lady, she just didn't seem to want to serve our table. The food was just ok. Nothing exciting. And probably more disappointing since I had already been there once and had such an awesome experience. 

Overall, I'm not sure if I would recommend it. I recommend the pizza, but I guess it is kind of hit or miss."}
{"text":"Visited the Phoenix area from Chicago several times, and always wanted to try Cibo.  Glad we finally did!  My wife and I split a few things for lunch in the nice outdoor seating area.  The Alla Parmigiana sandwich with the side salad, and the Margherita pizza were all exceptional!  Definitely a return visit will be in order!"}
{"text":"Came here to have an early valentines celebration on Monday night and it did not disappoint! The patio was romantic and even though it was a little chilly out they had plenty of heaters around. We started with a nice bottle of Chianti which was delicious. And then had the burrata which was the perfect amount for two people to share to start. Then we had the salsiccia and the diavola which were both amazing! After having an appetizer two pizzas were a little too much food but still tasty and nice to try a couple things. Service was quick and very friendly!"}
{"text":"YUM! Best pizza. I order the truffle pizza and die each time I eat there. Heaven!!!!!"}
{"text":"We came for dinner and it was a cute place. We weren't expecting it to be in a home, but it added to the charm. We ordered the burrata appetizer which had a ton of the cheese but not enough bread so ordered extra bread. Last time I had burrata at a restaurant the cheese was warm which I enjoyed... it was cold here but that is fine. I'm not sure what the norm is for serving it. 

Sadly, we didn't enjoy the pizza very much. We ordered it half \"Tricolore\" and half \"Tartufata\" -- the tartufata side was heavy on the truffle oil and a bit too strong/oily for me. The tricolore was okay.  If I were to come again (if I ever visit Arizona again) I think I would try the pizza Rosses over the Bianches. The bianches just sounded fantastic (these had no sauces).

Our waiter was nice. I felt bad for him trying to explain the special as it took well over a minute to describe just the soup. It was amusing as I'd hear him at each table explaining it, but what a mouthful! It sounded fantastic and we were very tempted to order it but we already had too much food."}
{"text":"..... And there's a new winner in town.

I really enjoy a good pie, as most of us do.  Lately, I've been finding myself at Cibo.  I use to fequent another spot in the Phoenix area for my pizza cravings however, that has all changed. 

So if your searching for  authentic Italian food, at  a reasonable price.  Look no further Cibo is the place for you. 

Every pizza on the menu at Cibo looks amazing. I cant wait to try them all.  So far my favorotes are the Salsiccia and and Diavola.  However, I would be neglectful if I  didn't' mention the calzones which are absolutely delicious, the best I ever had.

You have to start your meal with one  of Cibo's aperterisers.  Try the Arancini or Burrata, its more than enough for two people.  Cibo offers a modest  wine list at prices that  won't make you cringe  when you see them.  

The serving sizes at Cibo are very generous, however that didn't stop us from ending the night with a fruit crepe which was more than enough for two people.


The service at Cibo is second to none. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating. If your looking for amazing food and service, stop by you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"With the heaters, the outdoor patio was perfect. It's a particularly nice patio with lots of landscaping.

We had a Tartufata pizza, which was very tasty with the Bigi wine.

Service needed a kick-start, but after that, it was very good. (I think the hostess forgot to mention us to the server.) The server proved to be very nice and attentive.

Food: 4 stars
Service: 4 stars
Ambiance: 4 stars

We really loved the ambiance of the patio. Inside looked very cozy."}
{"text":"Let me make your life real easy here.  When you get lucky later, you can thank me. =)

First, start off  with the Il Tagliere - Antipasto, meat, cheese and fruit board.  Or the mixed vegetables.  mmm.  Course 1 = success.

Then move on to the Caprese Salad - So fresh!   The smell itself is intoxicating.  Course 2 = winner. 

Pizza time! 

From the Pizza Bianche: Siena - mozzarella and zucchini, topped with spek and
pecorino cheese.    ahhh!  the cheese, the crunch of the zucchini.  Spek (or hold this if you aren't a fan of spek, i like it both ways).    Course 3 =  Ding Ding! 

From the Pizza Rosse: Diavola - tomato sauce, mozzarella and
spicy salame.   You simply can't go wrong here.  

Don't forget dessert! 
Crepe -  I suggest the Fresca, but you really can't go wrong with any crepe on the menu.   Course 4 = Heavenly

They have a great wine selection.  I suggest the 1/2 bottle of Moscato d' Asti if you like wines of a sweeter, bubbly nature.  

Be prepared to fall in love.  The food, the atmosphere, great service.... this is a great little house-turned-restaurant in Central Phoenix.  It was built in the early 1900s and they have done a wonderful job with the decor.  Sitting out on the patio under the sparkling white lights in the trees is a great way to add a little magic to your date night.  If you take your special someone out for dinner here, I promise that your lucky night will end just the way you hope...  Ladies and Gentlemen...you are welcome.  hehe ;-)"}
{"text":"Yes five stars...well done Cibo...Weather you sit at small bar, inside, or great out front patio with it's well placed heat lamps I rank it above LGO in Arcadia which says something. Nestled Into a old style house in downtown Phoenix on a neighborhood street. Had one of the salads, pizza, and their berry/chocolate crepe for desert...all of it was porn food heaven...and a definite Top Ten place in Phoenix to take a date you really like. You may want to park a few blocks away to walk off the calories or hit up the dance floor at Chars has the Blues nearby."}
{"text":"The staff is incredibly friendly, the outdoor patio has a great relaxed, very homey, backyard chill kinda vibe. The food was excellent! We ordered the Burrata appetizer was Amazing! Very creamy burrata and nice drizzle of balsamic. We also had the Polpette which is an appetizer of 3 hearty delicious meatballs with meat sauce and nice crunchy bread. Delicious!

I ordered the Salsiccia with spicy salami and my wife orders the vegetariano. Both were very tasty, thin crust, nicely flavored sauce and crunchy edges. 

We skipped on dessert but the crepes looked awesome as well. 

Definitely on my bookmark list and will recommend to friends! Nice find!"}
{"text":"Absolutely to die for! Margherita pizza is my weakness, and theirs is one of the best. I love all the combos and that you can do 2 flavors on one pizza. Their choices are too good to pick just one! Love their arancini during happy hour too. What a cute, quaint little spot it's in."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a recommendation and it was amazing! First and foremost the outside seating is the coolest we've experienced in Phoenix yet, with live music playing inside. Didn't have to wait too long on a Saturday night for a table and all the service was super friendly and attentive. Split the salad, pizza, pasta dish of the day, and crepe dessert all between the two of us and were in carb overload. But so worth it! Will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came just for the desserts... Crepes are 5 star! Adorable ambiance and very comfortable vibe. This will def be a reg go-to spot"}
{"text":"Anytime my boyfriend and I want an incredible meal for a celebration we always end up going to Cibo. Never disappointed. 

Our anniversary, New Years, and my birthday most recently. Always consistently delicious. We normally split a bottle of Scarpetta Pinot Grigio and then the Burrata appetizer (only gripe would be that the Burrata has TONS of tomatoes on the dish recently. We miss the old days with ALL burrata!). For the pizza we normally get the Diavola. SO good! 

I am the type of person who tries lots of things on the menu first, but we found our favorites at Cibo and there's no turning back!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Cibo pronounced \"CHEE-boh\"over the years. I love the unique space being located inside a house (restored 1913 bungalow), with wood floors.... gives this place a warm inviting atmosphere. The owners are often there, friendly and staff is cool, helpful..... The outside patio area is beautiful on a nice night, white lights decorate the trees adding to the ambiance and coziness of the place. I always enjoy ordering the antipasto for two to share, a pizza or two, some wine and the amazing marscapone desert. Just wish they were open for dinner on Sunday. Check this place out sometime for a unique experience."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. The pizza was soggy. They seem very pretentious."}
{"text":"Cibo...where do I even start? Hands down the best pizzeria in Phoenix, and remains as the best pizza I've ever had. I've had nothing but great experiences with Cibo, everything I've ordered here has been amazing. The staff and owner are really friendly as well. My personal favorite pizza is the Tartufata, so good! I also really enjoy their patio and outdoor seating, looks awesome at night when all the lights are lit up."}
{"text":"Today was my first time at Cibo for lunch after several years of heading there for dinner.  I prefer the lunch menu.  The hot lunch sandwiches are amazing, we had the pulled pork and fried eggplant.  I very small salad comes on the side (it could use more dressing and less large onions.)  All the tables have umbrellas or are in the shade so it is a great spot to enjoy the beautiful March weather."}
{"text":"Not super great. We ordered a pizza with pesto, pasta dish and a sandwich. The truffle fries that came with the sandwich were the best of the meh food. I've heard people say that this place rivals Pizzeria Bianca, I disagree. But maybe it would just what we ordered, giving this place a 3 to give the benefit of the doubt. Won't be coming back though"}
{"text":"Talk about \"This Old House,\" - Cibo is definitely a place to try at least once.  I have to say that I was not impressed by their menu.  I happen to have a colorful palette and the food just didn't do it for me.  I did enjoy a few glasses of their house wines.  The atmosphere is nice if you're sitting closer to the front.  There's not much ambiance in the back room.  We felt a bit isolated."}
{"text":"we are repeat Cibo goers especially on Tuesdays when they have pasta specials.  Everything this place does is the bomb.   The cheese plate they did last time we were there was amazing.  This is a cool Romantic setting type of place, but last time we brought out 1 year old and it is family friendly too.  We just wish it was closer!  We live in Gilbert so it is a bit of a drive, but WELL worth it.  The crepe Suzette is amazing if you like marmalade."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with friends. We were really dissatisfied with the whole experience. Food was blah and the service was horrible. Every staff member we encountered was rude. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious and I always leave feeling like I'm friends with my server! So friendly and good at what they do :) my husband and I always get the calamari, pear salad and share a pizza. And if we have room, a crepe. So good!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on my last day in Calgary since the pictures looked so good. I love how you can order different apps and we chose the roasted eggplant, arancini balls, prosciutto, and whipped ricotta. All were delicious and the portions were huge for an app. Was anticipating small plates but they came on decent sized dishes. We also ordered the mushroom and truffle pizza to share. It arrived looking so amazing -fluffy crust, melted cheese, steam rising- but unfortunately it was kind of bland. No truffle flavor to be honest. I loved the crust of the pizza though. Should have gone for one of the tomato based pizzas instead. Excited to come back and try other pizzas and pastas though!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my bf. I have to say this place can be pretty romantic if you sit outside when the lights turn on. In the daytime it's like relaxing at a friends house having a meal but come night fall it's beautiful.

There's also soft music playing in the background. On the night we went they had low jazz playing and then a live guitarist playing along with it and it make the song and entire mood so much better.

I also love that yelp allows you to join the wait list as you're on your way to go there. Perfect if you're busy and needing a table somewhere quick. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and reasonably priced. I had the meatball pizza, and it was fantastic. The daily special is a particularly good value, and is scheduled instead of being about clearing something out of the kitchen. Will happily come back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Love dining on the cute outdoor patio. On a few occasions, there has been a live musician. 
Gluten free pizza is excellent- you almost don't realize it's gluten free. Fresh toppings were used on our pizza. 
Good pizza and wine selection as well. 
Service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"What a romantic and intimate little restaurant this is! Let me start by saying that this restaurant is the reason I signed up on yelp. I took a first date here (first time for both of us being here as well) and we both fell in love with it right off the bat. There was a little wait 15-30 on a Thursday at about 6:15pm and they don't take reservations for parties under 6 which is okay because everything made up for it. We sat on the patio and  got to watch the sun set on downtown and transition into the city lights. Clearly visible from our table was the chase tower, wells fargo, and many more. Our server was fantastic and on top of everything. Whats better than live music white lights in the trees and a view of downtown with a glass of wine. I will be back many a times A+++"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, especially outside.  Pizza was quite good, so was desert."}
{"text":"(I may get hate responses after this review and I contemplated in writing a POOR review of this place. After all this place is highly rated and suggested.)

Awkward, uncomfortable and RUDE is how our server made us feel with our party of only 4. We arrived during lunch time and we were the only ones at this restaurant. It was completely empty minus the employees.  We were seated immediately, but strangely our server obviously didn't want to be there at Cibo.  We informed it was our first time (at this OVERLY-hyped place) and was wondering what he would recommend? NO answer. We were interested in specials and asked if they offer anything with specials, he said NO not right now.  The server came and went numerously from our table and while we viewed the menu another party of 4 sat adjacent to us and a different server was cordial, polite and introduced himself by name, he relayed the specials of lunch and that dinner is approaching with happy hour specials.  My party and I were puzzled and said to one another, our server didn't relay any of this and why? He returned and we inquired about the specials, he said yes it's lunch still but we're approaching dinner soon. Can we still order off the lunch special menu? He said yes, but when my bf tried to order off the lunch menu our server then said \"I'm trying to PUSH the dinner\" and he said this Multiple times. I said, why? No response. Good for my bf when he stood firm on his decision and ordered off the lunch menu.  

Now the food: Although, the pizza was flavorful the pizzas are quiet small, more like a personal size and the dough is SUPER THIN and couldn't hold up my lightweight vegetarian ingredients. As soon as I picked up my slice the toppings immediately fell over and there was absolutely no structure support from the crust. This made it extremely challenging to eat. I folded it, rolled it and I mean this was Ridiculous.  3 of the 4 of us had the same complaints about the pizzas and quiet frankly it's not worth the price of what you get, they need to work on the portion size and their dough needs to be able to withstand light vegetables at least.  We also had the desert dough with Nutella, the dough seemed extremely stale.

Back to our server: He came and went, back and forth and every time he seemed to rush us with everything, but what's wrong with us enjoying what we have been served and enjoying our company? I finally got so irked at the server and straight up asked him \"are you in a hurry to get somewhere?\" He said no. I said, you sure have been acting like you do. Our server abruptly changed to someone else and without explanation. Our bill got messed up and took awhile to fix. Unsure if it was due to the change in servers.  Again, (AWKWARD).

I also wasn't sure if I should mention, yet I'm going to tell it. We sat at the corner of the restaurant where many flies were and yes we dined Indoors.  It was extremely annoying swatting them while at the dinner table.

We regret trying Cibo out. There pizza size and quality was more like an appetizer and thankfully we were asked by mutual friends to have dinner at the Federal and it was a 180 degrees a positive turn around that Cibo can take note of.  

Cibo is a cute place and I appreciate the restoration and flipping of a home into a business and their pizza is tasty, but they definitely need to improve on their customer service. Return factor: ZERO. Would I recommend it to anyone to give Cibo a shot? ABSOLUTELY NOT."}
{"text":"Great place in Phoenix, who knew? Cool ambiance at converted house. Sat on patio in spring; not too hot yet. Great meat & cheese plate, good pizzas. Only negative thing was atrocious live music. Really killed the ambiance."}
{"text":"Come for the pizza and stay for the atmosphere.  I would wager that everything on the menu is awesome but I've only been here two times now and both times I have gotten the pizza and a salad.  The Genova pizza is so good.  Its mozzarella, fresh basil and roasted potatoes.  Seriously, once you sink your teeth into it you realize what a good decision you made.  I also had the margarita pizza and it was excellent as well.  The outside seating area is so relaxing on a nice night.  It really has the whole romantic Italian restaurant thing going on and they have really good prices on beer also.  I was surprised that one of my favorite beers was available and even more surprised about the price.  I would recommend this place if you want an authentic Italian experience in a great environment."}
{"text":"First time in Phoenix and since we were just there for an overnight layover, we used Yelp to find something nearby that was awesome! Cibo was perfect. Indoor and outdoor seating with live music created the perfect ambiance. The Caprese salad was fresh and tasty. I also wasn't sure how big the pizzas were and we ordered our own. They were huge! Definitely order to share. Service was quick and awesome!"}
{"text":"I came here on an evening for a food event posted through Yelp. Cibo is a part of the Creative Restaurants Group, which has several other restaurants here in Calgary, including Locolous, Scopa, Posto, Parc and Bonterra. I paid for the event and received \"four\" courses with a wine pairing for each. I say \"four\" courses because there was so much food it felt like a dozen course, and for what I paid for it was more than worth it! 

The first course was an antipasto, we were served several different types of cheese, a few plates of winter veggies, and some sliced meats. I am not a big cheese person (shocking I know), however the cheeses were light enough that I really enjoyed them and even went back for seconds (shocker again!). The first cheese was a large slice that was harder and older, with an oil drizzle, the other cheeses were gargonzola. I have had gargonzola before and was worried these would be too strong, but they were lovely! One was smoked, and the other was done normally (however that is) and paired with a cranberry sauce. The winter veggies were really nice as they added some lightness to the other foods, and paired with a creamy sauce for dipping. The veggies included roasted carrots, beets, radishes and a large head of roasted cauliflower. The meats were a warmed ham and cheese combo, and the second was a salami and greens mixture. The warm ham and cheese was my favourite of the two. 

The Primi course included a white tuffle oil pasta, a risotto and gnocchi; all heavy on the carbs here see? My favourite was definitely the truffle oil pasta, fairly oily but a nice woodsy flavour from the truffle oil. The gnocchi had onions, mushrooms and a balsamic reduction from the looks of it. The Secondi course was the main course, we were given two plates with an array of meats (pigeon, pork belly, bacon, and pulled pork) and a plate of lightly marinated arugula. By this point all of us at the table were overly stuffed. We had eaten so much over the course of the evening, but were all very satisfied as the dishes were superb and well organized! The waiters and waitresses were patient and very helpful, as well as efficient and professional the entire time. 

The last course was the dessert. We were served a hazelnut cake with a cream sauce to drizzle (or pour if you were still hungry) on, and a chocolate custard cake. Both were heavenly, the custard richer than the hazelnut cake; so by that point the hazelnut cake was my favourite as it was light and fluffy, but still rich in a sense, even without the sauce. I am looking for a recipe to replicate this masterpiece! 

Thank you to the organizers of this event, it went really well and I think everyone left more than stuffed from the tables. Job well done :D"}
{"text":"Went here on First Friday and it was very busy. The two of us were quoted a half an hour wait, so we grabbed a drink at the bar. The bar is very small, only seats a few people but the bartenders were prompt with greeting us and making drinks. The wait was only about 10 minutes before we were seated on the patio. 

AMBIENCE - Great for a romantic date night or evening out with friends. There was a Jazz band playing, but we were still able to have a conversation.

DOG FRIENDLY PATIO

SERVICE - Extremely friendly and accommodating, on busy nights patience is necessary as the service is much slower. 

FOOD - Delicious! The calamari was cooked perfectly, the dipping sauce had a great flavor and a little bit of a spicy kick. The portions were well sized. It's a great opportunity to order several items and share as well."}
{"text":"What a great date night idea! So romantic and rustic at the same time. Was seated rather quickly for a busy night, saw some cute dogs on the patio, and food was served quickly. Would recommend for an affordable yet romantic date night spot... At least, more reasonable than the Vig next door! Will be going back to try a cr√™pe."}
{"text":"I went here for a date and I really liked the place.  The patio is very nice. I like the overall atmosphere as well. It's not your typical chain style restaurant. I think it may actually be in an old Craftsman house. 

Anyhow, the pizza is decent. It's not the best I've ever had, but I like it. The service was really good as well. Overall, I would come here again and I definitely recommend it for a date spot.. Especially when the weather is nice and you can take advantage of that glowing patio ambiance.

The only gripe would be that after a bottle of wine and splitting a pizza, we were asked twice if we wanted another pizza. Really? 2 pizzas in one night for 2 people? Granted they are not that big, but it's 4 pieces each. 

I didn't comment on the absurdity of the suggested portions, but as we got the check the girl said something like, \"guess we're eating light tonight\". I really felt like saying- \"no, we're not stuffing our faces tonight and instead eating appropriate portions. Though obesity is an epidemic there is an easy preventative measure that can be taken.\" But, I decided against being bitchy. Perhaps she can persuade other people to take the path of heart disease."}
{"text":"Wow! I have been waiting so long to give a five star review. I had a Margherita pizza with prosciutto and it was amazing. The service was great! My only regret is that I didn't have more time to explore the menu. I will be back!"}
{"text":"My experience was average at best.  The pizza ok the service was way too slow!"}
{"text":"After receiving recommendations from locals and looking this place up online, I was super excited to check this place out.

Dined here on a Tuesday evening, it was rather busy and we were in a larger group of 7. We ended up dining outside on the patio, which I loved!"}
{"text":"Food was great but the serving is a bit small for what you pay for. Service was and always great and will defenitely come back again. You need some starter before main course so you dont need to stop at McDonald's after.  :p.."}
{"text":"Good food and good atmosphere. I love the patio area, quaint and inviting,"}
{"text":"Mmmmm...went for brunch on a Sunday. Relaxing live music, shady outdoor seating, great food & service. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"After 3 bad experiences at Cibo over time, each caused by pretty random circumstances, I wrote a fairly nasty, profanity-laced review of this place last night. Basically, they ran out of some of their specials, didn't tell us in a timely manner, and then annoyed us further with some schtick about their chef not liking substitutions for an alternative entree we ordered. 

In response to my review, the owner wrote me a personal message acknowledging what happened and offering a heart-felt apology. She also graciously offered to comp my meal, which I told her she didn't have to do. I have to say, with that kind of attitude by a business owner, no one can argue that she doesn't care about the place or its customers. And so, I can only conclude that I've been struck by lightning (\"random crap going on with a manager or servers on a busy night\" lightning) 3 consecutive times. So, I will shift my review back up to 3 stars for now (2.5 from my original review, plus a half star for sending me such a nice email), and reserve judgment for my next visit. 

In the meantime, if you look at my original reviews of this place and filter out the annoyances that seemed to pop up, all of us the pluses still remain true."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to dine especially when the weather is nice. The patio is amazing! Everything I've tried is delicious. I love the pizza and I always have to follow up with dessert. It's always a pleasurable experience."}
{"text":"It's taken me way too long to write about one of my all-time favorite restaurants in the Valley, Cibo. I love everything about it: the phenomenal pizza, the beautiful decor, the on-top-of-things servers and the charming neighborhood location -- it's a must-try, for sure!

Cibo is in a historic home-turned-restaurant, with the most gorgeous twinkly light-lit patio (there are misters, so you can even sit here during the summer.) The interior is just as cute, with a small bar overlooking the open kitchen churning out perfect wood-fired pizzas. There's also an area that overlooks the backyard garden, and the rest of the inside seating is quaint and cozy -- you'll most likely be sat close to another table, so prepare to get intimate.

The obvious menu draw here is the pizza, and they're pretty close to perfect. You can get pizzas for dinner (their lunch menu consists mostly of sandwiches and salads.) 

A single pizza alone is a huge meal for one (though I can happily finish one myself and still manage to gobble up some dessert), so consider splitting an appetizer and sharing a pie. My favorite kind to get is a simple Margherita pizza with olives added ($12.50). The dough is always my favorite consistency -- thin and soft and with crispy edges. The fresh basil is amazing -- I love it!

Plan on having a crepe -- they're definitely a must-have if you go to Cibo. I love getting the Nutella and banana one and adding mascarpone and whipped cream to it, too ($10.50). Every bite is incredible, and it will have you coming back for more.

The atmosphere combined with the mouthwatering food solidifies Cibo as one of my go-to restaurants. It's truly a Valley gem, and I hope it stays open forever!"}
{"text":"Cibo deserves five stars for providing the restaurant trifecta - character-filled ambiance, excellent service and delectable cuisine. 

With so many reviews, I find it hard to bring anything else to the table with mine, but Cibo is so adorable I had to write a review anyway. I visited Cibo for dinner and fell like I was swept away to an adorable village in Naples. It was dark when we arrived and upon seeing the outdoor lights sparking on the courtyard patio, I immediately felt welcomed with open arms. When walking inside, the house was singing with visitors and staff alike. It felt like a home rather than a restaurant and what a good feeling that was. Although still a bit on the warm side, we sat outside underneath a grandfather tree and between the patio decor, glistening lights and secret garden-like atmosphere, it was already a positive experience without even tasting the food. The other visitors eating outside were regulars and immediately greeted us and began offering their suggestions when they realized they were talking to first timers. During the course of the dinner we started with Bresola and wine and contemplated about the pizza. But the regulars insisted that all first timers needed to try the Genova so we went with it and they were more than right. The Genova has mozzarella, homemade basil pesto, roasted potatoes white onions and grated Parmesan. All I can say is Grazia to the regulars because they know how to point newbies in the right direction! 

Prior to visiting, I was told that Cibo beats most other pizza restaurants in Phoenix and all it took was one taste to agree. I'm adding this to resident and visitor must lists alike because I'm deeming Cibo a staple Phoenix restaurant for anyone who enters our desert oasis!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Patio
Fantastic Pizza
Fantastic Wine
Fantastic Vibe

What more could you ask for. Need I say too much more? If you answered no....too bad. I am going to say at least a little more.  This patio with live guitar is absolutely phenomenal. Make sure to go at the right time of year for it to be a very pleasant evening. Don't skip the bruschetta and go with a group. Why you ask, so you can order quite a few pizzas and get to taste a slice of each.  Besides, pizza and wine with a good group of friends on a beautiful night on the patio...that sounds awesome.  Oh there you go, that's what more your could want, Fantastic Friends.  Well, that's on you. Cibo will provide the rest."}
{"text":"It seems like every time we come downtown we drive by Cibo on our way out and the place looks so busy that we decide not to stop.  Well, the Arizona Rattlers had a day game on Sunday so we stopped by Cibo for an early dinner.  The place was almost empty.  We were greeted quickly and seated in the South patio area with windows facing the dead grass in the yard and a disgusting fountain almost black from neglect.  I guess I have the type of sense of humor that doesn't appeal to everyone because our waitress treated us with a dull and lifeless demeanor almost to the point of contempt for me trying to be funny.  Our food was really no more exciting or enjoyable.  I tried the sausage pizza and my date had the Margarita.  I must admit they came out incredibly fast..... Almost too fast.  The thin crust was slightly underdone and not as crunchy as it should have been.  My date thought the taste of her pizza was bland.  I guess there just isn't much to be excited about here..... We won't be back."}
{"text":"The meat and cheese board is out of this world, and a great way to start the meal. Layer on top-notch pizza after that, and there are few places that compare!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and we have been coming for years. The patio is so beautiful and quaint and the service is good. The food is authentic and the pizza is divine. The homemade pasta is good but I promise you won't be disappointed by the pizza. I also love the house salad..its so simple yet delicious due to the fresh shaved parmesan and its so much more than a house salad. This is a great special occasion place but that doesn't mean we don't just go on a Tuesday! One tip...its pretty hot here in the summer due to it being an old house."}
{"text":"Ambiance was great, wine was OK, food was bad.

The pizza crust was OK but the olives and artichoke hearts were still briny from the can and overwhelmed the taste of the sauce and cheese. The \"prosciutto cotto\" was salty and flavorless; sliced deli meat placed in clumps around the pie. 

If you want the pizza that this place is trying to make, go to pizzeria bianco."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about Cibo..

We went last night after seeing Kathy Griffin so we were both in dazzeling moods having laughed all night.. well leave to someone to suck the good out of your mood right quick.

We arrived at Cibo right at 10, they close at 11. The usual host and hostess sat next to the door chatting with some friends. The waiters were sitting at the large table in the front wrapping silverware and the bartender well he just ignored us completely. Finally one of the waiters asked if wanted a table.. no we would like to stand their and smell the pizza! Duh! So we asked him to hold one moment as we used the restroom real quick. Then when we came back he was gone and we were standing there once again being ignored. Finally the bartender made a huge sigh and asked of there were only 2 of us.. so he takes us to the left dining room and there are only 2 tables in there.. guess where he sat us.. right next to a couple that looked like they getting VERY romantic.. so they gave us crusty looks.. I then asked the bartender if we could just sit at the bar (I can appreciate someone wanting space, I didn't want to sit next to them either).. so he turns and looks to me, sighed again and said \"if you want\".. like those words were somehow causing his hair to fall out. So I said \"Oh wait, I wouldn't want to put you out!\".. he then just turned and stormed towards the bar.. the Mr stopped him and said never mind.. (he didn't want him waiting on us after that little episode) so we sat next to the couple.. they looked at us like we had just interrupted a marriage proposal and she hadn't quite answered yet.

So Im mad as all heck.. Ive been treated badly before but I gotta know you before you can walk all over me! Im SO over Cibo at this point and ready to leave but the Mr talked me into staying.. he has this special talent of calming the beast, not that I turn green and tear my clothes off or anything but my tongue has been known to be very sharp! 

Waiter arrives takes our drink order.. nice wine list though very small.. he returns with the drinks and takes our dinner order.. antipasti, a rustica and a tricolore.. I asked if I could have prosciutto put on top.. you know what he says.. \"Ill ask the chef if you can have that.. he doesn't like changing HIS pizza's\".. I cocked my head at him (I think the vein in my forehead was ready explode) \"he doesn't like to change his pizza's\".. if you offer toppings on the menu for an up-charge, wouldn't you think they would actually give them to you? Talk about the dang pizza nazi! The waiter returns a few moments later or the 'chefs messenger'  (I think he was sweating) tells me that the chef has agreed to let me have the proccutio but only on a plate. Oh thank you thank you oh lord oh messiah! 

Can you believe this place?

While the food was good the attitudes here has really put me off.. so the 2 stars are for food only.. the Mr and I will never come to this place again.. Cibo has officially been scratched from our minds. Oh, I will be sending this review to them as well.. that way if they even care, which I doubt, they will address not only the bartenders attitude (little scruffy guy) but the idea that the customer pays their light bill and tells all of their friends about the place!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. Quaint little European style place. Caprese salad following by white pizza."}
{"text":"Incredible service and delicious food. Skip the wait with Pizzeria Bianco and come here -- this is where you find great pizza in Phoenix.

Highly recommend trying the 'fresca' dessert crepe -- ice cream inside a crepe with fresh fruit and whipped cream.

I also discovered my new favorite beer: Nimbus - Dirty Blonde - perfect beer to for tolerating 100+ degree weather. Try it. It rules."}
{"text":"First time here, and we were both very impressed! I started with the pear salad and my wife had T&K salad. We enjoyed them, but may have gotten away with sharing one since they were generously sized. We then split a Margherita pizza, which was excellent. The sauce, OMG, the sauce! and huge basil leaves and perfect crust made for a perfect pizza. Highly recommended. I added a glass of Pinot Grigio. And our waitress Nicole took great care of us. Life is good!"}
{"text":"The best pizza and crepes.  i had the crepe with fresh fruit and ice cream. i'm not a big crepe fan, but I crave theirs."}
{"text":"I love coming here with my wife. The food is typical nothing special; however, you pay for the ambiance."}
{"text":"Believe it. The gluten free pizza you've dreamt of has arrived. I come here for lunch when it's slow and quiet. I've had almost all of their pizzas now but my favorite is the Di Norte by far. If you're celiac then you better make this a destination meal because you will never find better :)"}
{"text":"I will start by saying that I lived in the Northern Region of Italy for four years and I loved every minute of it. This place reminds me of the fabulous eateries throughout Italy. Not only does the restaurant have the feel of Italy but the food is simple amazing. My wife and I enjoyed the place so much that we are taking six other friends and introducing them to Cibo. I have mixed emotions about posting this. The upside of the posting is that it allows others to read about the restaurant and then indulge in its fine food and atmosphere, the downside to the posting is that the word gets out and it becomes harder and harder to get a table. Oh well , the wait is worth the reward."}
{"text":"I haven't yelped in quite some time so I've got alot of catching up to do.

I found Cibo via our cute little Yelp friend when I was downtown one day picking up baseball tickets.

It's interesting, and HIDDEN to say the least, I must have driven up and down 3 streets before finding the little place.

The patio was packed for lunch so I opted to sit inside and catch up on some news while sipping on a Palagrino, the server recommended the hot Italian sausage sandwich with the house salad, being that I had never been to Cibo, I followed it and was soon in love with the aroma, tangy spices and uniqueness which danced on my palate.

So why no 5 stars? 

It's a little poser-ish of Bianco, or Bianco poser-ish off of it."}
{"text":"Food: 3.0
Atmosphere: 5.0

I dropped by Cibo on a Friday afternoon to grab pizza with a friend. Having never been there, I didn't know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised by the gorgeous outside patio! My friend and I were seated under a charming little tree all done up with lights and were really taken with how pretty everything looked. It was a slightly chilly night, but the outside heaters were more than adequate to help keep us warm throughout dinner. We're both cat lovers so we loved the roaming cats that were walking around the patio as well! 

Now, for the food. Let me start off by saying that I am a giant pizza FIEND. Pizza is what I crave almost all day, every day so I'm always looking for new, great places where I can get some delicious pizza! I also love arancini balls to death and basically jump up and down if I see them on a menu. When it came down to ordering, we grabbed the arancini, the margherita pizza, and the genova pizza. The arancini balls were good, but lacked a bit of inherent flavor and the margherita pizza was similar in the sense that it was good, but definitely on the blander side. The genova pizza, to me, was honestly a bad idea. The potato on the pizza was rather chunky and not sliced thin as I'd expected. Furthermore, the starchy texture of the potato mixed with the grainy texture of the pesto made it a really strange mouthful to swallow. Also be warned that the onions on this pizza are basically raw. I love onions, but there are only so many bites of raw onion that I can tolerate per meal. 

Service was good overall and we were definitely attended to quite well throughout the night. I loved this place for the patio, but not so sure about the food."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  Cute Christmas lights, indoor and outdoor seating (with heat lamps), and delicious (and strong) limoncello. Fabulous date night. My boyfriend's calzone was clearly burnt to a crisp on the top, which he took off. When the waitress came by to ask about the meal, he told her and she just said sorry. A little disappointing, but the freshness of the ingredients sang to me and my little pizza was perfect with asian pear, arugula, and gorgonzola. I liked it so much I had the left overs for breakfast the next day. I would love to go back. The crust also had the perfect bite and flavor. Yum!"}
{"text":"So worth the 50 minute drive to this place. The restaurant is an old charming house. Live music was playing outside in the evening and inside had a very welcoming atmosphere. 
Let me just say.... the pizza was AMAZING! We also got the bruschetta which was perfect for two people and my husband and I were fighting over the last bite of our Nutella crepe. This place will be a staple for our weekly dinner date night."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant.  The staff are very friendly and the food is delicious!  The owner can be seen there from time to time and though he speaks mostly Italian, he is still funny and a pleasure to talk to.  His paintings are the ones on the inside walls of the restaurant so it gives the place a cozy vibe.  Prices are reasonable too!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Pies in town ! Always fresh and always the best service."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times. Food is pretty tasty. Went with group of friends tried diff pizzas, salad and for dessert had crepes. Enjoyed the nice atmosphere. Great service too! A bit expensive for my budget so I don't go often."}
{"text":"Wow. One hour and I still do not have a simple pasta dish. Staff has told me twice I'm next in line but I don't believe it. Used to live this place but an hour for a simple pasta dish-- which I must take to go so I can make it to the theater -- is not acceptable."}
{"text":"I came here with a group knowing that avoiding dairy might be hard at a pizza place, but they did have pasta on the menu too.  Unfortunately the bolognese is \"finished\" with cheese, but that happens ahead of time so I couldn't get the pasta without cheese, so I ended up ordering a cheese-less pizza and substituting a spicy salami for the cheese at the waitresses recommendation.  I was charged extra (despite removing 3 kinds of cheese from the original order), and with the automatic gratuity (parties of 6+) I ended up spending $30 for a cheese-less pizza, a side house salad, and only drank water.
The service was pretty bad.  Maybe because our waitress knew she was getting auto gratuity she just didn't give a crap but she always seemed annoyed whenever near us, and one of our orders came out 15 min after the rest of the table (but they comped it).  
On a positive note, it has nice outdoor seating and there was a jazzy quartet playing, which I did enjoy.  I wish I would have known the pizza was going to be as large as it was.  I could have shared one and spent more money on some wine."}
{"text":"Best pizza in phoenix (Sorry Chef Bianco). Really affordable meal and wine! My new favorite place in phoenix."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on a date. Cool early October evening so we sat outside. Beautiful ambience on the patio with lush trees and twinkling lights strung everywhere. There was a man playing acoustic guitar and singing . We ordered a white pizza with prosciutto, mozzarella, mushrooms, & white truffle oil, it was divine! Pizzas are good size & enough for two if you're not starving. The have a large selection of by the bottle wine & about 10 each of reds & whites available by the glass."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Cibo. The restaurant is rather large but well spaced to provide comfortable casual seating. There is a lot of outside seating. The antipasto shared plate was quite good. The arancini was really good. The pizzas are decent with good quality ingredients and pleasant flavors. Our pizzas had a bit of a battle in the oven though. The desserts were also decent. Overall it is worth a return visit and makes for another dining option in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ahh...Cibo...such a great restaurant and one of my top five pizza joints in the Valley.  Great atmosphere, the service is stupendous and the food is to die for.  Why no pizza at lunch though?"}
{"text":"Love this little treasure in downtown Phoenix! It is always busy, but fortunately the day we went was a little cold for most people to want to be on the patio so we were able to be seated immediately! The patio is beautiful, do yourself a favor and go! Romantic and charming! The food is delicious, we had the margherita pizza and finished with the Nutella crepe! Highly recommend going!!"}
{"text":"Yelp's noting my check-ins here and asking what keeps me coming back. 

What keeps me coming back?

The burrata. A meal in itself. A perfect dish to share in such a romantic setting...smear some of the creamy, milky burrata on a toast piece and top with delicate prosciutto and chase it with super-garlicky, perfectly acidic, tiny tomatoes.

The crust. Perfectly chewy crust delivers the pizza toppings of your choice. Red or white: you can't go wrong!

The ambiance. This place has such charm! I love the setting; whether on the patio or inside, it's the kind of place you could linger and solve the world's problems over a bottle of wine and course after course of delicious food!"}
{"text":"Parking is a nightmare but supposedly they have valet so if there's a next time, we will try that. 

Phoenix weather is starting to get manageable so it's very nice to eat outside. We came after dusk so the lights were very pretty. We were seated in the more exposed outside area... There's another side right nearby that's more enclosed and looks much cozier. 

We had a 1/2 Tartufata and Capricciosa. I wanted something familiar and tasty and that was hard to find. I chose tartufata because I like mushrooms and the prosciutto. 

Um, the pizzas were barely ok. They weren't terrible, but nothing like the reviews suggested. It's thin crust, but was floppy. The only thing telling me the two diff pizzas apart was that one had olives. I THINK there was mushrooms but I didn't taste it. The pizzas, sauce and toppings, were one homogenous thing. I HATE that when it comes to pizza. It didn't come out cheese-bubbly and charred. 

It's an expensive small pizza. It should taste better than Dominoes. I'm hoping it's a bad day because it tastes like soggy leftover pizza. No cheese stringing away after you bite it or anything. It was an even layer of firm sauce  and toppings. 

The dessert was good. We had the fresca. The sliced peaches tasted it came from a can but the rest of the fruit was fresh and the ice cream and whipped cream was good. 

One last note. It seems the server dresses in whatever they want and there are a lot of them so it's just a flurry of people walking around, all wearing regular clothing. Sometimes we didn't know if they worked there to flag them down. I went to Clever Koi recently and the staff there was so friendly and really knew their menu. The servers here were curt and disinterested. However the people cleaning up our plates after each course were prompt. 

Pros:
Ambience (though we were on the \"less nice\" side
Dessert

Cons:
Pizza 
Service"}
{"text":"Good fresh food. It's mostly a pizzeria, and little to no pasta on the menu. Great deserts. Overall, a great meal."}
{"text":"I didn't write this review until now because I felt like our case might have been an anomaly so long ago when we went to CIBO for the first and only time. However, a friend has recently gone and had the same major incident.

Although I could write a lot more about my underwhelming experience, the most important part of this review is that CIBO does not take allergies with the utmost of seriousness, nor do they train their staff to do so.

I have a fatal allergy to nuts, which was clearly communicated to my server. She was meant to order a salad without walnuts, but delivered it with the walnuts and was unapologetic or concerned when I let her know (after taking my first bite). The rest of the evening continued to be a gong show, but to me, this was an extremely important slip-up, one that could cost my life.

I just learned last night that a friend of mine ended up in urgent care after a similar experience. It was also their first visit to the restaurant. He is extremely cautious about his nut allergy, so I know that they would have absolutely been forthcoming with their server about it.

CIBO, please educate your staff about the dangers of food allergies. All other restaurants seem to be well-versed, and often follow-up with a manager's visit to the table (unnecessary, but appreciated). Sadly, we will not return to this restaurant, as there are many other choices in the city who consider the health of their patrons their top priority."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place (pronounced as 'CHEE-BO')a few months ago and have been back at least a half-dozen times since. If you like real Italian/Naples style pizza, this is your place. While they also do a specialty pasta dish a couple days during the week, pizza is really the heart and soul of the place.

I like to dine here when the weather is nice and we can eat outside. On Friday and Saturday nights, they have a live jazz band outside. This can be a very romantic place to go and I highly recommend it for a date. 

All the deserts (except one) are using Nutella as an ingredient. I am not a fan of Nutella, but I must say the Pellani 2.0 is most excellent and only about $6. What is it? Imagine donut holes being served in a little metal basket with four wooden spears. You spear the donut hole with the little stick, then dip it in the ramekin of Nutella to your taste and enjoy! or, feed each other - very romantic.

The prices for what you get are very reasonable. Parking can be a challenge or you can use their complimentary valet.

Lot's of stuff to do downtown very close to this place (Film Bar, Angel's Trumpet, Crescent Ballroom, Breadfruit bar...too many things to do in this area that I can list here).

Highly recommended, but very limited menu. If you like REAL pizza, in a unique and romantic atmosphere and very affordable. I only wish I knew about this place sooner."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Tiny dishes.. Food was cold. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"This place is too small and the pizza is not memorable. I tried a shot of lemoncello and it was terrible and way too thick."}
{"text":"Hands down, THE BEST GLUTEN FREE PIZZA I've ever had. Cibo is a place my family comes back to again and again and never leave disappointed. Whether you eat gluten free or not, Cibo is one of the best restaurants in Arizona. 

Also, I recommend the lunch menu for the sandwiches and the crepes! Everything is amazing."}
{"text":"Best pizza downtown... In town! Way better atmosphere than Pomo, and better service! I LOVE CIBO! their handmade pastas are AMAZING! Great for date night!"}
{"text":"absolutely love this little gem tucked away in a converted brick home in downtown Phoenix.  Sat at the bar and ordered a salad and pizza and was blown away by both.  The pizza has a crust that reminds me of a crustier version of naan with a tasty sauce (not too much) and salami/mozzarella.  

Great patio when the weather is nice and cozy atmosphere inside.  Two thumbs enthusiastically up!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service.  I can't wait for the weather to cool down so we can sit on the patio enjoying teh music during dinner."}
{"text":"This former residential dwelling is nestled in downtown and surrounded with trees. When weather permits you should definitely dine outside. The service was great. The arugula pear salad is the business, light, crisp and delicious. I got a regular cheese pizza nothing fancy. Love the thin crust! Leave room for dessert, I'm glad I did. I love Cibo and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Wow! We had the best experience here this afternoon! The food was fantastic and the service was phenomenal. My husband and I sat at the bar and Angie was our server. She offered suggestions and was wonderful to have conversation with. If you're looking for incredible food, great atmosphere and dynamic service, you must try Cibo and ask for Angie!"}
{"text":"Went in 2012 loved it havnt been since but When I drive by its always busy. Food was pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix, fun experience, small rooms and tables but the food is the well worth it."}
{"text":"Whether seated inside amongst the eclectic decor or outside amongst the lit trees and occasional musician, Cibo is always an enjoyable experience. The experience includes a delicious array of salads and antipastis, a savory wine selection, brick oven pizza, lattes and desserts. In my opinion, you cannot go wrong with any item on the menu. P.S. Brunch is also a delightful affair."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about coming here as the place was pretty small. We came here on Friday night for dinner with a party of three. There were two tables outside if you preferred sitting outside to enjoy the weather. The place was small but a lot of people were there enjoying their food. BTW, this is a BYOB place which is a plus!! 

We started with an appetizer which was a seafood platter of shrimp, calamari,  anchovies and something else. They had run out of calamari so the gave us a bit more of everything else.  I did like it but not the anchovies. I was actually looking forward for the calamari. I ordered the linguini with seafood and my friends ordered the red snapper which was the special of the day. I LOVE the dish that I got as the pasta had a spicy kick to it. However, my friends food was not that great. The fish was undercooked and they didn't like how the rice taste. The waiter took the dishes back and they were able to ordered something else. I do have to say that the dishes were pretty small. 

I would definitely go back for more pasta!"}
{"text":"Another satisfied customer!  The food is so freaking delicious and fresh.  Cibo is in a beautiful old home that makes it feel intimate and romantic - there's really not a bad seat in the house.  Service is consistently good.  

Things you should know: they close from 2-5 on weekdays; they don't serve pizza for lunch and if I'm not mistaken, I believe they make fresh pasta on Tuesday's and Wednesday's.  

My favorite wines: Chianti, Neprica, Aglianico 

My favorite menu items: Burrata, margherita pizza"}
{"text":"This was a really good lunch place.  Close to Arizona Center so we worked up an appetite.  Pizza was so awesome, very authentic!"}
{"text":"So yesterday I'm in CenPho and pull out my handy dandy yelp app... I see reviews from Reese / Moanz / Samantha for this place less than a block away and it made my decision VERY easy.  

It's a cool old house, and probably not a place I would ever stop if not for the amazing reviews (which were spot on by the way).  Within fifteen minutes I was enjoying one of the best pizza pies I've tasted in Arizona... and the gorgonzola almost threw me off.  I'm glad I went with my instinct, the pie was perfectly cooked and the flavors were out of sight.  

Add to this an ice cold bottle of Peroni - and I was quite pleased with my decision.  Between this and Pomo, I'm convinced that it's the best couple of pies within a half mile anywhere in AZ.  COME EAT HERE!  You won't regret it.

Also, I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but if you like Nutella, you must try their Nutella crepe... it's pretty freaking tasty!"}
{"text":"Incredible pizza, awesome service, great atmosphere. Had the Di Notte, and it was the best pizza I've ever had. Four cheeses, spicy salami, balsamic onions, and the char flavor in the crust made for one hell of a meal. One that I wish I could eat every day."}
{"text":"Fresh food leaves me feeling light and refreshed every time"}
{"text":"My husband believes he is a pizza connoisseur and could eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. So for his birthday I decided we try out Cibo. It didn't disappoint. We happened to go during happy hour which was a plus so filled up on apps, entrees, and our twin daughters indulged in the Nutella and donuts. Definitely will be back! 

Small space inside though but still a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"We came to Cibo for a late dinner after watching a World Baseball Classic at Chase Field a few weeks ago. Cibo is one of the few restaurants in Phoenix that is open until later, and we came in to try their thin crust pizza. It is in a bit of a strange location, and is the only restaurant/store in that area. At first, we thought we entered the address incorrectly in the GPS, since Cibo doesn't have a lot of lighting in the front of the restaurant. It was close to 10:45pm on a Friday night, and the restaurant still had a good amount of tables, but we seated right away. We ordered:

-Funghi (Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Mushrooms, $11.50, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cibo-phoenix?select=4Tnb6awzTKGHJfdSdC1iJg#cYFU7ejhfB6tKUHWXCWvkw): Just ok for me. I thought the tomato sauce was a bit too tangy. However, this pizza is good for those who enjoy a classic and simple pizza. I wouldn't order this again though.
-La Dolce Vita (Burrata and Speck [Smoked Prosciutto] Topped w/Arugula and Balsamic Glaze, $16.50, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cibo-phoenix?select=4Tnb6awzTKGHJfdSdC1iJg#4Tnb6awzTKGHJfdSdC1iJg): Delicious! This was one of their specials that night. I've never had a pizza with burrata on it before, and I was glad we gave this a try. The burrata went really well with the speck, arugula, and balsamic glaze, but I think swapping the speck for guanciale would also be really tasty.

Their pizzas are split into red sauce and white sauce sections, and they have a good amount of variety for each type of sauce. We wanted to order more (the salads looked really good), but we had already snacked during the baseball game so weren't super hungry. I really appreciated that Cibo was still welcoming customers even though it was close to closing time- there's nothing worse than rushing to get to a restaurant before closing and the staff death staring you through the meal. Even though it was past closing when we left, there were still a good amount of customers still at the restaurant having a great time. The only slight complaint I have is that our server (I can't remember his name.. maybe Tom?) was really weird. He tried to crack a few really lame jokes, and become overly chummy with us. It was just a strange experience interacting with him, and none of us felt comfortable. I saw him drinking a glass of wine later on, so he probably got started a little too early. In any case, if you're looking for a good meal while out in Phoenix, and/or love thin crust pizza, make sure to check out Cibo!"}
{"text":"Our lunch was my 3rd or 4th time here- and I still really like it after our meal today.  We came here for Mother's Day lunch after a morning of hockey- meaning we were all pretty hungry.  There was a brunch menu for Mothers Day, as well as the regular menu- and Sundays are HALF PRICE pizza!!!!  We started with a Proscuitto scolledina to share- tasty, esp the fig jam to compliment the meat.  I had the goat cheese pizza- amazingly yummy pizza with intriguing mix of toppings, and with the Sunday special, only cost $9????  OMG, that is crazy cheap for the high quality pizza.  Henry and kris each had the Cibo burger with a very large side of truffle oil/Parmesan fries- I helped Henry finish this double patty burger, and it was flavourful and juicy.  The fries were totally irresistible- they were pretty hard to not reach over and steal, many times.  Adam got the kids spaghetti with meatballs- and despite coming here starving, was still only able to finish half, as it was really large and filling for a kid meal.
The meal itself was super- it is a great place for pizza.  
Service was attentive and polite.
It is a pretty loud place, but I can excuse that because it is family friendly, and with today being Mother's Day- I am guessing there were more kids, toddlers and babies than normal, for lunch, at one time."}
{"text":"Cibo is a great place to get fresh, delicious pizza in an intimate setting. The crepes are also delicious and I recommend this place to anyone looking for quality food at a good price. The fact that it is an historic house adds charm!"}
{"text":"Cozy little place! Everything in their store gives you a great experience. Service is great and the food is amazing. We always get pizzas as we think they do have one of the best pizzas in the Valley. 

Sometimes they have live music in the outdoor area which could be fun and romantic depending on what you like"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in to have some crepes, we ordered one with fruits and while it did looks delicious, it was not as tasteful as it looked.  The strawberries tasted very tarty and the lemon cream inside was not that great. I would much rather stick to my all time crepe place, colados. Also we felt a bit claustrophobic  inside."}
{"text":"Love this place. Have been there once for lunch & couple of times for dinner. The last time I went was for a friends birthday & although they take reservations, they will not seat you until the entire party has arrived. It was a Saturday night & they were jam packed. We did mention once we were seated that we had tickets for a comedy show & were on somewhat of a time crunch. They took note & were able to get our meal to us promptly. Most of us shared pizzas & they were excellent! Real mozzarella, tasty red sauce & fresh ingredients. One of the girls had the wood board mixture of meats, cheeses, veggies & fruits. It was such a huge plate that it could have fed the entire table of 9 as a nice appetizer. Drinks were good but as mentioned in a previous post, they should consider having another bar open on busy nights. We felt like we were crowding some of the folks who were eating at the bar while we tried to order drinks before we were seated. Overall great place!"}
{"text":"2 Things - Either my appetizer grew or I'm just being a chunky monkey!?  I don't recall the last time I finish a pizza on my own - wow!  Look mom I cleaned my plate off!  Yes my friends I had my O face on.  Needless to say food is was awesome.  The ambience was great; it's literally a house with rooms as the dining area.  Love the hardwood floors classic!  One thing I notice was the artwork; I believe they are from local artists - plus fresh flowers on the table...nice touch.  The patio is like walking onto hollywood movie set - Xmas lights hanging from the trees.  Service was good - my server reminded me of that dude from the Devil's Reject - scary but cool dude.  Got a date? ... now you got a place to go :)"}
{"text":"One of the best places in Phoenix for lunch, dinner or brunch!! I've eaten here a couple of times and forgot to write a review = bad Yelper..  But after hearing back from a friend that I suggested this place to, they loved it and have since been back here 3 times within the past couple of weeks!! 

Food~ yes their pizza is DELISH however they offer many other dishes that I think you will find just as delightful or maybe even better!  For lunch, please consider ordering the PLT - toasted prosciutto, mixed greens, tomato and spicy roasted bell pepper aioli.  Ask them to add some cheesy mozzarella goodness if your a fan like me : -)  It is one of the best sammiches you'll find around the Metro.  For a lighter lunch but just as filling go for one of the awesome salads;  The Capri, or the Couscous salad or my fave the Mele ~ organic mixed greens topped with chopped chicken, walnuts, apples, blue cheese and an apple vinaigrette dressing = yum-fest!! 

For dinner, start with a either their grilled veggies or the antipasto special; meat and cheeses!  Both are wonderful!  Have fun choosing a pizza!! They are all too good for me to mention one over the others.  Seriously!! Just save some room for one of the Nutella crepes!!  They a couple of different ones to choose from ~ they are a super way to wrap up a wonderful meal!!

Restaurant~  This place is loads of fun yet it is somewhat romantic too! Sit outside and enjoy their terace - patio when the weather permits. It's a wonderful setting and a great place to have fun convo with a date or with friends.  Their indoor seating is also wonderful.  There's not a bad seat in this place.  The service is excellent!! They are very attentive, they know their menu items and help even the pickiest eater find something they would like!! 

I'm looking forward to going back to Cibo very soon!  I hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"Cibo is probably my favorite restaurant in (close to?) downtown Phoenix. Everything I've tried on the menu is excellent, they offer such a generous happy hour, and service is professional. There are quite a few lauded Italian restaurants in the vicinity, but none come close to Cibo in my opinion. 

The interior feels like a renovated cottage, complete with cute doorways and cozy tables. Space is a little cramped, but nothing compared to San Francisco restaurants, and I think the strategically-placed stained glass and doorways really help to increase the feeling of privacy between tables. It gets packed here very quickly during dinnertimes, but parking usually isn't too bad since there's plenty of street parking on the side streets. 

Meatballs (happy hour menu):
I've never found an Italian meatball dish that I've enjoyed until Cibo's version. There is such an amazing balance of meatiness and flavor so that the meatballs don't feel heavy. They're cooked to perfection, so no overcooked ground meat leaving that sort of dry, powdery taste after some chewing. The red sauce ladled on top is savory and complex, and it's a delight to fork off a little bit of the meatball, place it on top of the nicely toasted bread, and top it off with an additional spoonful of the red sauce. This dish is so good I ordered a second after we had polished off the first one, and I bet that it won't be the last time I do that. 

Gnocchi (happy hour menu):
When I took my first bite of this gnocchi dish, I don't think I knew how to react for a few seconds. I could taste the freshness of the potato, the softness of the gnocchi, the complexity in flavor of the tomato cream sauce that was made with fresh ingredients, and the creaminess of cheese. It was the first time that I'd understood why gnocchi is often described as \"little potato pillows,\" and all the components of this dish elevated it to something I would expect at a fancy Italian restaurant, not on a happy hour menu. I was not only impressed with the preparation of this dish, but also the fact that such care was taken to make a happy hour menu dish. 

Fried dough spheres with nutella (happy hour menu):
These mini-donut holes are freshly fried and dusted with sugar. Dunking them in the nutella yields a decadently-chocolatey churro bite. They are a bit heavy, but that's to be expected considering they are.. fried balls of dough. 

Di Notte (white sauce):
The spicy salame is pretty darn spicy in my opinion, but it complemented the creaminess of the white sauce and flavor of the cheese very well. I liked that the dough was chewy in the center and wood-fired crunchy towards the ends. The dough was definitely fresh, as I could detect the fragrance of fresh flour. 

Da Vinci (red sauce):
I personally prefer the red sauce pizzas, as they boast of a well-balanced red sauce that has both notes of saltiness and tanginess. This cuts the heaviness of the cheese on top nicely, and with a fresh sprinkling of basil, I felt like I could continue eating this pizza even after I was full. 

Berry crepe with marscapone: 
Warm, decadent, and well-balanced with the acidity of the berries and creaminess of the marscapone. The crepe itself is thin and elastic as opposed to cakey and airy, but I think it goes extremely well with the fresh berries and marscapone. This is hands down the perfect palate cleansing dessert after a flavorful meal, and I'd order it again and again.

I haven't had a chance to try the special pasta dishes offered each day of the week, but if they're anything like the rest of the menu, I'm sure they'll be delightful."}
{"text":"I'd heard a lot of good things about Cibo, so it has been on my to-do list for some time now. What better day to give this cozy little home-turned-romantic-restaurant a whirl than our Anniversary?

Cibo lived up to my expectations. The setting was perfect: candle-lit outdoor setting with some easy listening live music playing in the background of our conversation. The pizza is delicious and fairly priced, given the atmosphere and ingredients (some said to be shipped from Italy). Our server was kind and genuine. Cibo was everything we'd hoped it would be, and maybe more."}
{"text":"Really, really nice... The patio is pretty with multiples lights, perfect for springs nights.  Service is GREAT, food IS delicious..."}
{"text":"I'd been to CIbo a couple times and had good impressions. Yeah, it's on the pricier side but I wouldn't argue if you said the pizza challenged for the best in the valley. Service had always been pretty much par and the whole experience just kind of enjoyable. Then I saw the reviews on here (1200+ -- so why am I even bothering with mine?) and was really glad I hadn't Yelped Cibo first.

Look, the food is good and the atmosphere is inviting. Really, it's good. But it's a restaurant. It's got a small space and you are going to get the fallbacks that come with a popular and small place. Now, I know some people feel like they aren't going to a worthwhile establishment if they aren't waiting -- I disagree. But I will say this is -- if you are looking for a good dining experience, Cibo is there. If you're looking for the out of this world experience that some Yelpers have had, I can't provide a roadmap for that."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. Ordered from the lunch menu that offered a variety of 3 items for $16. I had the fettuccine, roasted eggplant, and arugula salad. The fettuccine and roasted eggplant were amazing, flavorful, and savory. The potions were just right."}
{"text":"I am a fan, period. I wish someone would take me here, but I might just go alone or with my mom... Hah."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite Italian place downtown! The service is impeccable, especially if Ivey is your server. Had a fantastic experience this evening and was having trouble picking a pie since they're so many delicious choices. Ivey suggested the diavola with arugula and it was amazing! Next time you're downtown check out this gem."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  Let me start out by saying I'm not a huge fan of Neapolitan style pizzas. I'm more of a New York style pizza fan the Burrata antipasto was delicious and enough for three people! The pizza was good but nothing special but all in all a very good place with great service friendly people and awesome environment"}
{"text":"Cibo is another of those hidden gems that you would probably never notice if you were just passing through or don't make it to downtown Phoenix. Since this is an old bungalow that has been made into an eatery, this place is smack dab if the middle of a residential neighborhood.
Their menu consists of pizza, salads and sandwiches made on fine Italian bread with some awesome Italian meats and cheeses and fresh local ingredients. I love the meatball sandwich so much that I can't bring myself to order anything else. I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu. The service is friendly and the atmosphere homey. Their outdoor patio is really a pleasant place to enjoy lunch. I really need to come here for dinner or their new breakfast. Cibo is truly among the best that Phoenix has to offer."}
{"text":"it was rainy. it was crowded. it was good pizza.

i really wanted the burrata, but i was vetoed. bah. 
we had the tartufata, genova and something with sausage on it - maybe the salsiccia? the sausage one was ok - we got it to satisfy the little cousin who was with us. 
the tartufata was incredible - i mean, what thing with truffle oil isn't? the genova, also delightful. 

and like most others, we came here because we couldn't stand a 3+ hour wait at PB. sigh. but all in all, a good alternative."}
{"text":"Love this place. The atmosphere is so nice and relaxing. I love the outdoor seating with the lighting in the trees. The food is very good, though honestly I've had better brick oven pizza. Appetizers are excellent. Desserts are fantastic and come in large portions. I mostly come for the environment though!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday, we are outside and the lights and candles at night were very pretty!  When we first got there I was a little confused who would be helping us. The hostesses were dressed very casually, I thought they were guests. We got a little table and ordered a starter (fried rice and cheese). These were good. Then we ordered our food, and eventually dessert. The dessert was my favorite part. I got a Nutella and Marscapone crepe and added ice cream. It was the perfect amount of sweetness. The restaurant wasn't very busy but the service was very slow. We arrived at 7 and left at 9."}
{"text":"My waitress was terrible but the pizza was fantastic.  I mean seriously, this was great food.  I know exactly why my waitress sat us so far away from everyone else.  I get it.  I saw and spoke to my bus....uh, girl more than my waitress as well but eh, I wont let that stop me from coming back.  GREAT FOOD!"}
{"text":"I'm impressed! We went around 11pm at night and the atmosphere was great. There was a live band playing! And our waiter was super nice. We ordered a few pizzas but the best one is... one that I cannot pronounce. lol. I just know it has prosciutto in it and other meats. I also added anchovies in there as well. Delicious!

The board we ordered was nice too. Got to stir up our appetite with the wine. Overall, the outdoor patio experience was pretty. It was chill and relaxed. I want to come back and try the other food as well. Or stick to the ones we had because our pizzas and appetizers were really good."}
{"text":"Cibo... surprisingly earning 5 stars from me.  This is overall a great place to EAT!

The setting:  

It is on the corner of the street on 5th ave near downtown Phoenix.  It is in a house, that's right, someone's house turned into a charming little restaurant where the front yard has tons of little tables weaved around trees and patio heaters in the winter.  They also have a beautiful set up with the lights hung from the trees that gives you that intimate feel as soon as the sun hides out for the night.  On weekends you'll get some live music, calm accoustic music from nothing but reguar joe's outside on a picnic table entertaining the old fashion way, with guitars and other instruments to soothe you into the delicious food that awaits.  Inside, as soon as you walk in you notice the Chef, through a small opening, a glimpse into where the magic happens.  He is there on weekends for sure.  And yes you want to eat there while he is present. 

The food:

It was a busy friday night for us and it was FAST.  Not too fast, we did not feel rushed out of there.  The pizza's had that wood fire smell I grew up with, it reminded me of the pies this Italian man used to serve out of his van (which had a wood fire oven in it), when I was a child.  The best pizza in the world, somehow Cibo duplicated that taste and brought back some childhood memories just like Remy's ratatouille did for Igor. 

Don't miss the Buratta appertizer, big enough to share with 3 or 4 people at $14.  The cheese was simply bliss, if you love good fresh mozzarella you've had nothing yet, this buffalo moz is outstanding... creamy and perfectly balanced with grilled bread and prosciutto.  You will not be sorry.

The Burschetta Trio is also a very nice size portion, it does come in six pieces for only $10.  That's a bargain.  If you have the buratta and then taste the mozzerella on the bruschetta you will find it bland and the mozerella will taste like a cheaper cheese  so eat the bruschetta first. 
 
now to the \"Pizze\"...   Just triumphant.  Don't look any further this has what you need, just keep your order simple and you will not dissapointed.

The Service: 

Folks there sound Italian, from the greetings to pronouncing things the correct way to us butcher the beautiful language.  Everything sounds and taste better when you know how it is meant to be pronouced.  They were friendly and efficient.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Italians know that if you want to sit there for a while while you eat... go for it.

Don't miss:

The burarta app and of course the pizzas.  Sit outside and enjoy the neighborhood feeling of dining in your front lawn.

REMEMBER:  If you want to try some of the best Mozzerella you've ever tasted, call in advance to see if they have Burrata in that week... They can run out of this little piece of heaven...

Cibo, you are a strong restaurant, a gem.  Keep up the good food and the tradition that flows in your menu."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Cibo. Ok, in all fairness I have to give this place the props it is due. The atmosphere is AWESOME. Really (good date material). But beyond that, the food was again mediocre. We ordered the pesto salad and the vegitariano pizza. The pesto salad was like oil on leafy greens (yuck). And the pizza was flavorless (the sauce was terrible, and the veggies were not much better). Sorry to not jump on the love bandwagon here, but I can't do more than 2 stars (two visits, two strikes). The service was great (no issues there). But the food....no bueno."}
{"text":"Never again. I have had much better pizza, served by much friendlier staff for much less of my dollars. I don't mind paying for good food, but you are paying for ambiance here and the food and customer service is only sub-par. Not going back."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with a colleague recently and we had a wonderful time. It was bit too chilly to sit in their lovely garden so we sat inside where it was more cozy. 

Lunch was excellent. I had the Polpette (meatball sandwich) and my friend had the PLT, both with a side salad. My sandwich was one of the best meatball sandwiched I'd ever had. The bread was chewy; the meat was flavorful; and the cheese was melted to perfection. The portion size for the sandwich and salad was perfect.

The only thing this place has going against it is a lack of parking. I got there early so I could get free parking on the street about a block away (I don't believe in paying for parking when possible). There were meters and they have a complementary valet too for people willing to pay to park."}
{"text":"This place is always a treat when my husband and I get to go! The first time we went the service was incredible! Start to finish amazing. The second time we ate there the service was the opposite of our first experience. The food was still incredible and consistent. I'll come back just for the food!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!! Will definitely go back. Huge portions. I'm Italian- so I can vouch for sure. I ate too fast so I wasn't able to take pics ha ha"}
{"text":"Set in a restored 1913 bungalow, Cibo (pronounced \"CHEE-boh\") has hardwood floors, exposed brick, a stained-glass panel and a fireplace to set the mood.
   Right off the bat, I was impressed with the ambiance this place exudes. Every corner of this place is unique, Great for small parties, or just two. 
   We were seated outside at a table for four. The server was very well versed with the wine list, and the menu. She right away offered some appetizer ideas, and wine pairings. All good offerings. We decided on a bottle of Vipra rossa. It was over all a good wine, and went well with dinner. Also we ordered the 3 Pair Buschetta. This little gem was awesome. It came to our table on a cutting board type platter. Three little bruschetta slices each having a different topping. First was grape tomatoes and basil, the second had cannelini beans, and the third had prosciutto crudo and mozzarella. Ah mazz ING. 
    Being that I wasn't feeling super adventurous on the meal, I just ordered the Diavola pizza for one. Average pizza I'd have to say, was not very inventive. Good presentation though.
   Service was a five."}
{"text":"Cibo is literally my favorite restaurant in Arizona!  This quaint, completely wonderful restaurant is an incredible experience.  Love the outdoor patio with the twinkle lights and the food is to die for!  The best pizza I've ever had!  My fav is the Salsiccia con Patate made with mozzarella, sausage and potato!  Their margarita pizza, Antipasto speciale and even the Nutella and banana crepe dessert are also delish!  I would reccomend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Italian in Phoenix! Read my lips! BEST ITALIAN in Phoenix... you will fall in love or I will buy you dinner. Haha"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite on our way to Sedona.  We loved the atmosphere and the food was awesome."}
{"text":"For the love of Jesus! I went here with miss Dottsy Z for our girls date night and omg this place is fantastic! I have been here one other time 6 years ago on a blind date and had forgotten just how good the food was. 

We started off with the ever popular Burrata, which is- fresh mozzarella with a creamy heart topped with a balsamic glaze served with black label prosciutto crudo and toasted bread. From what I understand it is goats milk cheese that is flown in fresh daily and they have limited quantities. To say this is like butter is an understatement. It was delicious!!!!! Next I ordered the Rustica which is mozzarella, topped with prosciutto crudo and arugula after pizza is cooked. It took everything in me not to eat the entire damn pizza. Dottsy ordered the Prosciutto Crudo which is similar except hers has red sauce and no arugula. My goodness. I am still shaking my head and kicking myself for giving Dottsy all the leftovers. What in the world was I thinking? I will be back again very soon and not wait 6 years for another visit."}
{"text":"Got a date night?  Wanna take her to someplace special you'll be calling \"your place\" eventually?  In the doghouse and you need to treat her to something romantic?  Look no further than Cibo.

Eat outdoors as I think the inside can get a little noisy...you wanna be able to sweet talk her after all.

Wonderful wine selection, and the food is amazingly fresh and delicious!  Menu ranges from light bites to full on meals that'll load ya full of carbs.  Pasta dishes are great and the chef often whips up new and exciting things.

Highly recommended..."}
{"text":"AMAZING PLACE!!! You will never be dissatisfied!!!!!!! I can't say enough great things about this place, you have to check it out!!! WONDERFUL FOOD! REASONABLE PRICES, EXCELLENT SERVICE! GREAT PIZZA! A TRUE ITALIAN RESTAURANT! YOULL LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Yum, this place was great.  Went with a party of 5 on this past first friday's and only waiting about 10-15 minutes.  Not too bad at all!  Services was excellent.  I loved their wine list.  We each ordered a different pizza, so I was able to try 5 different kinds.  I like the quattro cheese one the most.  It was delicious.  I will definitely return once I've checked out some other pizza this town has to offer.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Would eat here every day if my girlfriend would let me. 
Best Calamari I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"Went here when traveling for work as a local colleague recommended. Excellent spot fresh pizza. Fresh salads  and nice atmosphere but the most memorable part of the meal was their deserts. Nutella crepes were unbelievable.  We went with a group of 15 and service was outstanding. Next time I am in Phoenix, Cibo is a must stop."}
{"text":"Awesome neighborhood place. Beautiful patio, cozy atmosphere, and, most importantly, great food. I love the pizza, but the sandwiches at lunch (which are made with wood fired pizza dough bread) are unbeatable. I only wish I could get those sandwiches at dinner..."}
{"text":"The pizza and pasta are delicious! Id recommend the wild boar and bacon. The ravioli was excellent.  It gets very busy on the weekend so its best to come earlier to beat the rush (6pm)"}
{"text":"Delicios new york style thin crust pizza with simple topping combinations as it should.  They also have a good selection of salads.  We enjoyed the dining atmosphere (low key cafe) but the waitress we had kept trying to rush us to leave."}
{"text":"I tried out Cibo today for the first time after hearing rave reviews.  The food was good but not the best I've ever had, but the patio and our server Sean Kennedy made this place worthy of five stars.  Right from the get-go he had us laughing so hard and never made us feel rushed when we sat around for two hours giggling.  I can't wait to come back and experience the great patio again!!"}
{"text":"Tuesday evening, three adults, came about 5 pm, not busy. 1st time here. Chose from Yelp reviews. Nice environment.

Good service, liked the varied menu. Had the 4 cheese pizza and the marguerita pizza, good size, fresh ingredients, excellent. Also had one small salad, fresh and tasty.

Prices not cheap, yet high quality, would comeback if in the area.

Needs help: Outside maintenance needs work, holes in the pavement, garden needs attention, some paint needed. Could indicate lack of attention inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"DOWNGRADE. I'm adding a new category thanks to a conversation with the manager of Cibo. It is the U-LIST. Unbelievable. Just returned from Cibo and could not believe the manager. 

The main course was raw and there was no offer to adjust the bill. She stated that our dining experience was not significantly interrupted while having a mouthful of raw meat. Apparently, I was unaware that raw meat as part of the dining experience is a minor event. It then follows that the new Cibo customer service policy as of yesterday, October 1 is: If you have a significant interruption in the quality of the food served or level of service at our establishment, the customer will not be offered an adjustment of the bill or any other compensation for our error. 

Anyone who pretends that others should accept improperly cooked food and a poor dining experience without some form of compensation, while they themselves would not accept the same is unacceptable. Would like to hear from others who have had to deal with this manager. 

Sorry, but it's difficult to give this establishment future business as a result of this unpleasant experience. The one star rating is extreme and given the lack of vision, communication and problem solving ability on the part of the manager it is warranted. 

As always - You decide. For real. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Wow - 
I must admit, Cibo impressed me more than I anticipated... even after reading the 100 reviews that came before mine!

I had plans to meet my friend and future yelper Leslie F for lunch on Monday, and when she suggested Cibo since it's near where she works, I jumped on it... after all, I'd never been and I'd been wanting to try it for ages!

Maybe lunchtime is the time to go, as we didn't have to wait for a table and our service was right on... Sara was our waitress and she was just the right amount of attentive; she gave us time to peruse the menu per our request but brought our iced teas out right away.  They stayed full too... thanks to the attentive rest of the staff.  I felt like I drank about 5 gallons of tea (it's really good by the way).

I opted for a vegetariano sandwich served hot with a house salad.  The saltimbocca bread is worth breaking the wedding diet for, and the grilled zucchini, roasted red bell peppers, grilled eggplant and mozzarella are just the right amount of flavor in between the fresh bread.  Each bite was uhhhmazing.  I love when restaurants choose not to skimp on the quality or the quantity.  The salad was the perfect compliment as well.

Leslie chose the Sicilia salad.  She is a Cibo regular but this was the first time she had this particular salad.  It comes with organic mixed greens, orange slices, goat cheese, and toasted almonds with Grand Marnier dressing and a side of fresh bread.  She seemed happy with her order as well.  The other salads and sandwiches looked appealing as well.

We skipped dessert although Leslie told me that the mini crepes they serve are fabulous... I'll have to return to try those as well as the pizzas one evening for dinner.  

I know Jared will also love the bungalow style house and laid back ambiance that Cibo offers in addition to the fabulous menu and service we received.  I can't wait to share my new find with him!"}
{"text":"It seemed to take too long for the pizza to come out, but it was good. I liked the atmosphere but the parking situation sucked. I had the nutella crepes for dessert and quite honestly they are a distant second to crackers and company's crepes. Not impressed enough with the overall situation to come back."}
{"text":"This is my fav pizza spot in all of Arizona. Quality food and great service. Great spot for date night."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd trip to Cibo's and I brought a friend. We went to support their donations for childhood cancer when you order the polpette appetizer - we didn't k ow what it was but we were going to have it just to be charitable 
OMG they're meatballs like you've never had before in the most amazing red sauce w/ Parmesan & fresh basil! Delicious! We also had the wood fired Margherita pizza. The crust was incredible! Could have used a little more mozzarella, but overall really delicious and then comfortable dessert we had the crepe filled with mascarpone al limone cheese with fresh berries- a must have ! 
Go! Make it a date night, sit on the patio, they have live subtle music too. And it's totally an affordable place. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Slow service and this place charges for soda refills!!!  Pizza is ok, but NO FREE DRINK REFILLS!!!!  There's better."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Cibo when we visited Phoenix.  The pizza is excellent.  I'd have to say it is either the best or the second best pizza we've eaten, and we eat a lot of pizza.  The crust was not thick or thin, it was just right.  The ingredients were fresh and the cheese was delicious! We waited about 1 hour to finally score a spot at the bar, which is first come, first serve.  Be sure to get there when they open or you're in for a long wait.  Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Just as good a Pizzeria Bianco! But with the added bonus of not having to wait for hours and hours. Granted there may still be a wait here but you aren't fighting tourist for tables at this joint. It's more of a local fav! 

Fresh gourmet toppings and very good crust! Personally a big fan of the garden seating! There was a longer than normal wait for the food however, the server was very attentive and I thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance as we had drinks in garden. I would not recommend this place for a quick meal but it's perfect if you bring friends and want to have time to relax and enjoy conversation!"}
{"text":"Best italian food in Phoenix, great atmosphere.  Lived in Italy for a year, and this is the equal to the best I had there. Fantastic. The antipasti plate is the best i've ever seen, the pizza is wonderful, and the crepes are to die for.  Cute, comfortable setting. But get there early - I'm not the only person who rates it best in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"As always the food and ambiance was like home.  Can't say the same for  our server.  Dude had to be high on some good ganja...  He was all smily and extremely forgetful and slooooow.  Don't know if Tom had a bad day or is new, but he really was lacking some energy.  C'mon when your eatin good italian food you want the passion that belongs with the Italian spirit I know the owners have.  No offense to Cibo at all,  just farmer Tom.
See ya next time,  ehhhh ciao"}
{"text":"Cibo is a family favorite for us. We love going to eat fresh and healthy foods, but to also enjoy our time in the fresh air on their front patio seating area. At night, it's romantic with the lights in the trees where you can eat dinner and enjoy a drink or two. Every time we have people from out of town with us, we bring them to Cibo so we can show them what Phoenix culture looks and feels like. It's such a great place. The energy is awesome and so is the food."}
{"text":"The pizza's are inventive and really really tasty. I personally think it makes Pizzeria Bianco look overrated.  The location isn't in the historic district, but there's a larger patio, and the inside of the building is simply more comfortable in my opinion. I personally really like this spot in Phoenix. I can also personally recommend it as a great double- or triple-date spot!

Family friendly, yuppie friendly, hipster friendly, all with good wine and good food. Walking distance from downtown venues and clubs, it's a great way to kick your night off with good taste and class. If you're a pizza fan, and you're in Phoenix, this would be the place I'd call a \"don't miss.\""}
{"text":"I am not sure why but some of the best pizza I've had comes from the Arizona desert.  The outside seating looked pleasant surrounded by nice trees.  However, it was 110 degrees in Phoenix but the inside is nice and cool.  The bar is cozy and it was refreshing to get a local brew from Oak Creek Sedona.  I think there was only 4 choices of pizzas on the menu, I chose the one with sausage and it was delicious.  The parking lot can fill up but there is lots of parking on the adjacent streets.  It was a relaxing stop with nice service from everyone there."}
{"text":"Honestly, I have nothing bad to say about this place...and I've eaten here at least 10 times. The service has always been great, food excellent (love the crostini appies, pizza and the spaghetti and meatballs for 2). Nice vibe with the open kitchen or even sitting at the bar, which we usually do. Just writing this makes me want to go!"}
{"text":"OMG! The food is soooo good!  This place is hoppin' so make sure to get a reservation.  The staff is very friendly, but the food is some of the best in Calgary."}
{"text":"Five stars from me without a doubt. A must try!

We chose to sit outside on a Saturday night. There was a bit of a wait, but I didn't expect to be seated right away on a weekend anyway. There was plenty of extra seating and live music, too, which made the wait more enjoyable. The patio ambiance was so nice and pretty. I'd like to check out the inside next time.

Our waitress recommended the burrata appetizer, which was awesome and filling, but light at the same time. We ordered the Diavola and Tartufata pizzas at other Yelpers' recommendations. Of course added ricotta to the Diavola- also after reading reviews. They were both amazing. The crusts were light and crispy, the toppings were flavorful... even leftovers the next day were great! (and you WILL have leftovers) It's very hard to pick a winner, but I might go with... the Tartufata? But try both! Our waitress even told us we'd picked the best red and the best white pizzas they had."}
{"text":"What more can you ask for?  Tasty food and efficient yet friendly service in a cozy, romantic environment.  They only take reservations for a group of 6 or more so be prepared to wait about on hour on busy nights.  Although we waited for about 45 minutes, it was well woth it."}
{"text":"Love love love!  Best food in Phoenix.  Must have the Nutella strawberry crepe with vanilla ice cream... house salad really great and meatball sandwich with fresh bread."}
{"text":"We had just one night in Phoenix and Cibo was such a pleasant surprise! As New York pizza snobs, we took a leap of faith that paid off deliciously. Attentive service, straightforward but creative menu and seriously good pizza - if I make it back to Phoenix, Cibo will for sure be on my list"}
{"text":"Oh Cibo, how I love thee...

1) Pizza...fresh, light, flavorful perfection. 
2) Crepe...is there a word that is BETTER than perfection? Heavenly? Orgasmic? Scrumpdiliolusciousness?? Well, call it whatever you want, because it was all that and more. 

There isn't alot of room there, it's a renovated historic house, but they make every bit of space work for them. Sorry for the short review, but I'll be sure to update this next time I go!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! My go to pizza is the tartafata pizza. You can't go wrong. I like the \"super\" crepe for dessert. It's not on the menu. Strawberries, Marscepone and Nutella filled crepe topped with vanilla ice cream. Wash it all down with a fresh vanilla latte. This place doesn't disappoint. Get here early as it's almost always packed. Give it a try. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Cibo restaurant has absolutely fantastic dessert ( Nutella  banana creeps )and wine selection. Their pizza on the other hand is a bit overpriced for what it is. If you are picky with your pizza be aware this might not be the place for you but the salads are a great dinner selection ."}
{"text":"This place is everything everyone says it is. The atmosphere and crowd is always lively, the ambiance is sophisticated without being stuffy, and the food is constantly great. Grab a seat outside on a Spring evening, can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I love the outdoor dining, but feel a bit claustrophobic inside. Expect long wait times during peak hours (and potentially slow service), but the food is good and the staff is friendly. Based on the wait times when I've visited, I've only been twice. Both pizza's were delish."}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza in AZ. There are many wood fired pizza places but there is something about Cibo that makes them our favorite. The crust is fired to a crisp yet just chewy enough texture. The cheeses and sauces are so fresh and delicious. On this trip we enjoyed the Caprese salad, sausage pizza and calzone that was filled with salami, prosciutto, ricotta, mozzarella and sauce. We have had Bianco and Cibo and we enjoy Cibo just a little more."}
{"text":"We were told that it would be about a 30 minute wait to sit outside.  We decided it was worth the wait since it was such a beautiful night.  We ended up being seated in less than 10 minutes.  The ambiance was awesome with great lighting and trees all around us.  The guitar player was icing on the cake.  His music was soft enough that we didn't have to shout to each other and loud enough that we could enjoy the music.  I highly recommend Cibo.  This restaurant is a great option for date night or dinner with family.  You can't really go wrong.  I recommend the nutella strawberry crepe for dessert.  Only downside is that service was slightly slow.  We had to ask for our dishes to be removed after we ordered dessert.  But I still gave them 5 stars because the ambiance made us feel at ease to stay as long as we wanted."}
{"text":"The burrata is out of this world! The ingredients are so fresh and flavorful! The margherita pizza is my personal favorite! You can go wrong with a classic like that. Cibo's is legit!!"}
{"text":"Yeah, another fiver, we had an amazing meal hear this weekend.  All the pizzas were great, I especially love the dough, it has so much flavor and perfect texture.  We were crepe crazy and ordered four of them, and they were so goooood! The orange marmalade one turned out to be my fav, I didn't expect that, but wow! It was so good! The marscapone and berry was a very close second.  I do have to mention for the sake of hoping it will help, not our waitress (she was AMAZING!) but the girl who brought the food to us, had a shitty attitude.  Thinkin a tune up is in order."}
{"text":"Wahoo Cibo!

I am an absolute pizza lover and this place made me very happy.

I read up on Cibo in a recent Phoenix Magazine article and felt it was time to check it out and expand my pizza-horizons. My man and I drove down and were in love at first sight.

The atmosphere of this place is perfection. Right up my alley. The twinkly lights and warm patio was almost as cozy looking as the inside of the old home. A delicious pizza place in a quaint bungalow in downtown Phoenix? Yes please! 

I love my wine almost as much as I love my pizza. So when I asked my server for a recommendation, she provided a sweet, flavorful glass of an Italian white wine. The wine combined with the Caprese Salad and a fresh Margherita pizza...I was in heaven. This will be a favorite of ours for quite some time to come. Thank you, Cibo!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Cibo for delicious pizza for quite some time. I always order the Tartufata pizza- delicious prosciutto, cheeses, mushrooms and truffle oil. A surprisingly amazing combo. The crust of the pizza always seals the deal. Fresh with a hint of smoke from the wood firing oven. The customer service here has gone down in the past year or so. The restaurant is in a historic house with original wood floors. The front patio is also great to eat on when weather permits- it is too hot out right now. I prefer going there in the spring or winter when they have heaters turned on. The trees on the patio have little white lights strung through them giving a romantic vibe. This would also be a fun place for a girls day out, birthday dinner or any special occasion. When relatives come from out of town, this is where I take them. The most recent downside I've found to Cibo is their breakfast/brunch. I ordered an omlette- forgot the name of it, was topped with tomato sauce and some spinach. The egg tasted old and the sauce wasn't warm on top. I paid around $10 for a plate I picked at. I recommend only lunch or dinner here, which are excellent in terms of quality, selection, price and ambiance."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Pizza joints in Phoenix, I would say certainly in the top 5. My only beef with them is their lack of seating but that is a good thing I would guess as they are plenty busy. The service here rocks and the food is top notch. The best thing is they have crepes. YUM. Parking is also hard to find but after a calorie laden meal a nice walk is welcome."}
{"text":"I have to say that this place is the best of the best. I come here regularly, and the servers always recognize me (I don't know it that's a good thing or bad thing). It's a great place to enjoy wine and dinner before you head out for the night. Also, a great first date place. I brought my boyfriend (from a small town in Michigan) to Cibo for dinner, and he absolutely loved it... nothing like this in his small hometown. 

And the best part about this restaurant... the CREPES. Yes, they are absolutely delicious. I recommend the strawberry and nutella with whipped cream... YUM!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place! Haven't been here in a few years and we are happy we made it back! Buratta appetizer is a must, great for sharing! We each got our own pizzas and the cheese they use is delicious. The dessert menu looked to die for but we were to full :(  so plan ahead!"}
{"text":"Dammm this joint is good, I mean the pizza.

Crushing all pizzerias in the area, no competition.......delicious!!!

The crust is perfect. Light crisp in the outside and fluffy in the inside, not too thick and not to thin either. Gives me a NY feel when in the Williamsburg area devouring pizza at spot called Patrizia's.

The meats are plump and juicy, great quality, right amount of fresh cheese, I love it.

5 stars for quality, presentation, and dining experience."}
{"text":"Its easy to get into an Us vs Them, West Downtown vs East Downtown, Cibo vs Bianco pissing match, but truly these places are so unique and valuable in their own way as to coexist in a culturally void downtown in a soulless metro.  

Cibo, however, does indeed take the lead by a very significant stretch over Bianco.  

First and very much FOREMOST, the owners are absolute treasures.  They have never been anything less than engaging, charming, and overtly polite.  Whether my gf and I eat there or take out, they always greets us as friends and seem to be genuinely appreciative of our business.  On one visit when i was with a large party of about 10-12 people we kinda had to squeeze into a small area in the front room, which was still quaint and comfortable, but i made an offhand joke after the owner looked concerned about my smallish seat, that she could \"make it up to me with a beer\".  I was completely embarrassed as she REALLY DID bring me a Celebration Ale on the house.  She's just an awesome lady.

Their building itself is enamoring with a large patio for the pleasant autumn nights of Phoenix and their interior is very cozy for a more subtle dinner.  The restaurant can be both romantic or merry.  

Their tiny bar is perfect for a short wait (never waited longer than 5-10 mins at most), especially during take out where we like to enjoy their Sangiovese Chianti blend. 

Their pizza itself is delicious.  The Rustica is my go-to and they tend to use generous amounts of meat and cheese (the prosciutto being my favorite).  Their portions are perfect for two people and are well-informed on how many pizzas will be 'just enough' for your party.  Also, their marscapone/Nutella crepes are insanely good.

If you ever have a chance to host an event, see if they will let you use their carriage house in the back, where, come to find out after we used it for our own holiday party, had a \"recent tenant\".  Lucky dude to have Cibo as a neighbor.  

The back carriage house has a wine bar and a private server as well as a small patio for outside drinking/smoking.  Cibo is a perfect little neighborhood pizzeria."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way home from Sedona to Chicago.  Had a night to kill before catching the plane the next morning.  My husband had been here before during a business trip and wanted me to try it.  Cibo is located in a renovated house on a quiet street in Phoenix.  If you blink, you might miss it.  We loved the cozy atmosphere and the friendly wait staff. We ate dinner early and it's a good thing too because it was packed with a long line when we left.  Everything we dined on was divine!  We started with the Omero Salad and a glass of  Damiani Chianti. For a salad it was quite tasty.  I ordered the Capricciosa and my husband had the Di Notte pizza.  For dessert we squeezed in Nutella and Strawberries.  Everything we had was heavenly!  We walked away sated and very happy.  Will definitely come here again next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Great food and romantic vibe! Took my wife here and we had an amazing night with great food and drinks. Love the complementary valet parking and ambience. Would recommend for any couples looking for a nice date!"}
{"text":"What a great night! Excellent table outside, solid service, good pasta & incredible pizza. One slight issue: fried calamari starter - nicely breaded & fried however the calamari was cut into thick strips (not a fan), needed salt & thought the red pepper aioli didn't match. Drinks very nice. Sausage pizza was one of the best we've had...crust was delicious & only slightly charred, good mozzarella, simple tomato sauce & house made fennel sausage. Server gave us a leisurely pace which we love. We will be returning. Good, casual place to bring friends."}
{"text":"Went to Cibo last night with wife and in-laws.  Arrived around 7:30 on a Friday night and it was apparent we weren't the only ones wanting to get dinner.   Upon arrival, we were told it was going to be a glass of wine wait so thirty minutes later and a glass of wine, we were seated at a nice table in the front of the restaurant.   Our waitress Jessica was extremely attentive, friendly and helpful.   Shared a few salads and three pies.   The caprese was mediocre along with the sausage pie(not going to spell it correctly) but diavola and capricosa were great.   Really liked the flavor and crust.   Very nice interior and pleasant staff, had it not been as cold as it was, the outdoor seating looked very inviting."}
{"text":"I do NOT understand the hype with this place.  I was expecting to be blown away.  I was not.  It is ok.  The sauce is not that great on the pizza, but the crust was amazing.  The sausage was pretty bland, too.  Cheese was good, just needed a little more.  The pulled pork sandwich had a super wood flavor...a little too much.  The fruit salad was just ok.  It's good but not great.  I prefer the Parlor for pizza."}
{"text":"Charming restaurant that delivered with excellent pizza and prompt, friendly service.  It is located in a neighborhood and is very unassuming.  However, the food and service made this a can't miss spot!"}
{"text":"Now serving breakfast and Cibo offers the perfect alfresco experience. I've always loved the front portion of the property and today we enjoyed perfect weather and an amazing meal.  I want to move in!
We both started with a cocktail, I had the Bellini and we looked over the menu and both decided on the Fritatta Melfitana, an egg omelet filled with Schreiner's sausage, mozzarella cheese, Schreiner's bacon and topped with grated Pecorino Romano and chives.  Our dish came with roasted potatoes with chives, toasted bread, marmalades and a side fruit parfait. The price point is just a tad higher than most places BUT the quality, taste and presentation make it well worth the extra change. 

 I posted a pic, yeah...THAT GOOD!"}
{"text":"We called and asked if we could make a reservation and the guy who answered the phone laughed and said no. We showed up around 7:30 and there was at least a one hour wait. Put our name on the list and went to the bar to wait for our table. Bartender was awesome. After an hour we had to go to our event so we left and received a text message 15 minutes later saying our table was ready LOL! Can't comment on the food but seemed like everybody was enjoying themselves and Patio was exceptional."}
{"text":"Romantic, quaint, amazing! We were referred here by a couple of long time Phoenix locals, and we were so happy we took their advice. We ordered a white pizza, a anti-pasta appetizer, and bottle of Chianti. We were able to get a table outside and loved the atmosphere! Perfect date spot..."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful and whimsical environment. Usually, food is really good. I'm not sure if they were just so busy they were more concerned about getting it out quick instead of the quality. Just a bit disappointing.  Now, we were a large party so we easily entertained ourselves, and thank goodness because we had the rudest waitress I think I ever had. She seemed so inconvenienced and unhappy to be there. Let me also say, we asked for 3 different checks and she added gratuity to our individual checks. Which I don't like be cause I always give more for a tip! She was so rude, she was lucky she added the tip because she would have got way less!"}
{"text":"You're downtown, you want interesting pizza options without the 5 hour wait, and your hunrgy...

That's me.

Funny thing is, I actually didn't like this place at first, but now it's a first choice.

It's a cute little place with delicious food. Never had a problem, and rarely do I wait (but I'm an early eater). Never tried their lunch options, however.

I recommend the pesto salad, prosciutto pizza, and you need to try a crepe. MARSCAPONE AND NUTELLA?????? Umm, OK!

DROOOOOL...."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Atmosphere, service, food great!  If you ever have a bad experience here, stuff happens as they do with most places.  Don't judge, just give them another chance or just come back when you're having a better day.  Signed: A former restaurant owner."}
{"text":"My wife and I love coming here. It has a very cool outdoor seating option and is in a fun part of town with complementary valet parking in the back of the restaurant.

Tonight, we had a GF sicilian pizza and the caprese salad was AMAZING! The GF dough was fluffy but tasted like charcoal and not bread. We were sad about the dough but the salad more than made up for it. The pizza and salad was $32 before tip.

Service was cordial but not outstanding. Five stars for better GF dough and better service!"}
{"text":"Amazing little pizza joint in downtown Phoenix. 

I cannot believe I just found this place, though I've lived up the street for over five years. 

Location: 5th Ave, downtown Phoenix.  There's street parking here and there, but I can walk!

Food:  Pizza, salads, sandwiches, bread, Nutella-based desserts, wine.  We ordered a pear salad that was tasty; it included arugula, pear, and cheese. The bread delivered with the salad was a white chewy bread.  My friend wanted meat on his pizza, and I didn't. They allowed us to get half and half; I got my veggie pizza on one side, and his sausage was on the other. Perfect!   The dessert we ordered was kind of like a delicious deconstructed funnel cake with Nutella for dipping sauce - delicious!  

Service: The servers were efficient and brought us water throughout and were helpful and quick.  I wouldn't say the employees were overly friendly, though. While walking in, a female employee opened the door but just kind of stood there, not saying anything. No, \"welcome\" or \"hello\" - nothing.  Strange to me, but that's my Texan roots craving some more friendliness! 

For reservations, one must have a group of six or more to make reservations.  We just had two but easily found a table on a Saturday evening at 5:30pm."}
{"text":"I'm rating this just for their crepes- nothing else, so take it for what it's worth.  Got their strawberry and nutella.  Just tasted ok, like everything else I've had before but with too much nutella, without the whipped cream which could have helped it (could have gotten it for an extra $2).

I would go elsewhere for dessert.  Their food may be good.  Their waitresses seemed snooty but it seems like a nice, cozy place to go with a small group of friends for intimate conversations."}
{"text":"The first time we went to Cibo it was delightful. The second time, not so much. First my fianc√© had a dirty glass to where you could visibly see the old lipstick mark. Although not preferred, this isn't something that would affect us from coming back or not. Then we noticed a hair in our pizza, which to me is unacceptable. They replaced it with no issue. They did, however, rush the replacement pizza out which wasn't cooked properly. It did not have much taste either. The waiter did not offer a discount but oddly gave me the wrong amount of change for our bill. Wasn't too sure if this was his way of apologizing, but overall was a very lousy experience."}
{"text":"Cibo has been one of my staples and I go fairly frequently, and have for years. I love all of their salads, pizzas sandwiches, the burrata and of course, the crepes. Yum. Double yum. They have a nice wine list, the ambiance is great, and service is great. Brunch is amazing too. The only thing I've ever been disappointed in is that a month ago, i went for lunch and got a pizza.. definitely wasn't of the same caliber as the dinner pizzas. I will stick with 'za and dinner and enjoy their amazing sandwiches for lunch."}
{"text":"Very cute cozy patio seating. The menu had two pasta on it. We split a maker salad it had both red and white quinoa. My husband had the pasta bolognese. Homemade pasta good portion very tasty. I had a gluten-free pizza with white sauce goat-cheese, pear, prosciutto!  It was awesome! I just wish I had room for their desserts."}
{"text":"Arrived here about 6pm tonight and it was already packed with 2 parties waiting ahead of us. Cute little historic home converted into a restaurant, tons of charm little space as is the norm in downtown suburbia. Main entrance..11 o'clock 3 two tops..bam right there not 5 ft from the door. 12 o'clock kitchen, 1 o'clock bar, 3 o'clock  two 2 tops lining the wall. We were offered one of the 11'oclock tables but there was no way. There is nothing I hate more than sitting on top of another table. They were so close even Nicole Ritchie couldnt squeeze between them. This space would be better served by 3 small high bar tables, allow for more traffic space and you're not forced to dine with strangers. Needless to say I would rather wait for a table that avoids the potential of being bumped and or drinks/food being spilled on me. We were seated in a side room and it was perfect, not too close to fellow diners yet still feeling a part of the energy. From the seating to departure was excellent. Service, was impeccable. Pizza's take a bit but they're made from scratch and worth waiting for. I ordered a white pizza (Salsiccia con Patate) and it was perfection.. My friend ordered a red pizza which I tried and you can taste the fresh tomatoes, no canned sauce here. Although extremely tasty Im still loyal to Spinatos on the red pizza. But white pizza they have my vote. Made sure I didnt gorge because I was dying to try their dessert. I am a HUGE fan of Nutella and they have 3 or 4 variations on Nutella crepes..I had the banana/nutella concoction with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and Im salivating being reminded of it. Nice call on the dessert Cibo, if not the white pizza I will return for the dessert. Either way I will be back.

P.S. We let at 8pm and there had to be at least an hour wait. If you have somehwere to be on Saturday night and this is your first stop. I suggest you get there upon opening at 5pm to avoid any interruption in your plans."}
{"text":"The service was kinda slow when we were here. It took so long to bring the food out. The outdoor seating atmosphere was beautiful with a lot of trees and live music.

We got a salad (I forgot the name but it's in a small table menu), 3 pairs of bruschetta, a margherita pizza and a calzone.

The salad was fun with a lot of cool ingredients. The bruschetta was good but I didn't like the bean one. The bean didn't go very well with this type of food. The pizza and calzone were pretty normal to me. I've had a lot of wood-fired pizzas and they were just at a standard level.

I was impressed mostly with the prosciuttos!!! They were very soft and not too salty. They were perfect to my taste.

Overall I would come back here again for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"After having waited for 2-3 hours for the \"privilege\" of eating at Pizzeria Bianca (on more than one occasion), I am SO glad that a friend got me to try Cibo instead.
The food is just as good (similar, rather limited menu, so make sure everyone in your party is up for pizza & salads & wine), but the wait to get seated is MUCH shorter and the patio setting is LOVELY. Even the indoor seats are preferable to Bianca's open room brick box. 
My husband and I get so excited for the cooler weather in Phoenix because we know that Cibo's patio is now an option for Date Night.
Try the calzone and one of their great salads (i'm partial to the Omero but the Pear Salad is wonderful as well).
A glass or two of the house Chianti makes it complete. 
Oh, if you have room, the Crepes are delicious--share them with someone you love for dessert.
Service has always been attentive, but not overly friendly (it's not that kind of place)."}
{"text":"Came for dinner and there was live music outside. We chose the outdoor dining despite worries (and an eventual) mosquito bite. The outdoor seating is super romantic and pretty. It's large and comfortable, plus not near a busy street so it feels private. 

We tried one pizza (split into two types), pear salad, and a bolognese pasta. Everything was delicious. We spent a long time reviewing the menu since there were so many options and combinations. Eventually, we did ask for recommendations. 

First pick for pizza was the mushrooms and the second was one with sliced Italian bacon. The pear salad added some additional sweet flavor so we ended up not even choosing a dessert to try. 

This place is great for small groups or even an intimate evening for two. We didn't have a wait, but I would recommend a person to go early to get better seating. We were not right in front of the musicians, but close enough to hear each other speak and enjoy the music."}
{"text":"I love this place!! A friend picked it out for our group of 10 and we had reservations at around 5:15 PM on a Saturday night. It was within walking distance of the Hyatt Regency..Phoenix has lovely weather in February. 

This place is super cute with all the lights outside, fire pit, little water fall/fountains for the birds to play in. Definitely cutesy plate for dates and couples! We got there at just the right time, because soon enough, the place was packed and everyone had eyes on our table. The owners are constantly serving people and accommodating everyone, super cool. Even though we were pretty much done with our meal, we didn't feel rushed to leave ASAP. 

Several people in our group got the Pesto and Pear Salad. I tried the Pesto Salad and loved it. The potatoes are yum! I got the Funghi pizza and added sausage (posted a picture of this one), a friend got the salmone, and another got a calzone (huge btw!) The salmone was interesting, I've never had salmon on my pizza before - but I liked it. We all wanted to get crepes at the beginning of the meal, but ended up having a lot of pizza leftover and no room for dessert. When I come back to Phoenix in January, I am going to split a pizza and salad with someone and get dessert - no doubt."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good service, nice environment. I'm a regular here because of the great happy hour specials they have. I love bringing people here and showing them how great the food is here."}
{"text":"Cute little spot for pizza. It definitely isn't our favorite as they are made super quick and with very minimal sauces or toppings. You don't really get full. Would suggest you get your own pizza. The beers are reasonably priced. Seating is quite cramped but atmosphere is pretty cute and nearly divey and prices are moderate."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I have lived here four years and I can not believe that I just found out about it this year. I have been there several times and the service is impeccable, the food is mouth watering and the ambiance is great. The owners are such nice, friendly people and I have to give a shout out to TOM. Who made my night with amazing recommendations and genuine service. :)"}
{"text":"Decided to make the rare drive out to downtown Phoenix to check out a highly recommended restaurant from my friends called Cibo. I am a self proclaimed pizza connesiuer/snob and this place hit my fancy right on the pallet. Started off with the 3 pairs of bruchetta, the bread was toasted perfectly and the toppings were plentiful. Followed that up with the Diavola; spicy salami pizza! Fantastic! Fresh mozzarella, simple red sauce topped with great tasting spicy salami and cooked perfectly in a wood fired brick oven. Unfortunatly I didn't have any room for the great selection of crepes which judging by the looks at the table next to mine looked out of this world. I only gave Cibo four stars cause unfortunatly our server was a space cadet. The server assistants were on the ball filling our waters cleaning up the dirty plates and delivering the food, but our waitress failed to notice our empty cocktails, make any return trips, and offer up any desserts. But all in all I would return. Keep up the good work CIBO!"}
{"text":"The best pizza place in Phoenix! Great food and very reasonable prices. Nowhere else compares"}
{"text":"Place is over-rated. Food is very much average. We ordered Bruschetta, arancini, pasta and Pizza. none of them was up-to the mark. This place deserved maybe 2 stars but I gave it 1 since it is already over-rated."}
{"text":"Perfect pizza and great food all around.  A necessary stop in Phoenix. Save room for apps, dinner and dessert."}
{"text":"Cibo has a great atmosphere and a wonderful menu. Servers are very pleasant and have gone out of their way to provide excellent customer service. Try the limoncello!"}
{"text":"This coming from a born and bred Chicagoan.

You're not going to find much better than this in Phoenix but that doesn't mean this place is amazing.

I give 2.5 stars to the waitress alone. She was friendly and helpful, brought us out a 2nd pizza after she realized we really, really, didn't like our first, and was all around cheery.

If the hot salame pizza had more sauce, I'd return. But...unless I go here for work lunch and someone else pays, I doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"The best thing about Cibo is that you can eat outside. The food is not that great. Phoenicians just don't know about good quality Italian food ... too bad."}
{"text":"Such an enchanting cottage-like restaurant. I love the little romantic twinkle lights throughout the yard. The ambiance is magical, and so are the desert cr√™pes! I would come here just for a special desert date, without a doubt! Pizza here is pretty classic, so I can't complain. The only reason I took off one star is because our waiter was kind of scatter-brained. He was definitely nice enough, and maybe it was just his first day. However, the service suffered a little bit. At one point, he asked my party what we wanted drink, just to  neglect the one person that quickly responded with her order. He handed people the wrong orders and kind of disappeared a lot. Lastly, it took him forever to get our checks out at the end because he \"lost track\" of a beer that one couple in our group ordered. All in all, I would still come back. I enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review because I have loved this place for so long. Now myself and about 40 of my friends will never be back.  We had thrown a rehearsal dinner here and were all very excited but by the time we left we were disappointed, my friend wrote in with her feedback and instead, Michelle, blamed her!!  It was our fault it was hot, it was our fault the guests had to serve themselves, it was our fault dinner and dessert came out late. 

I get it things happen but how the company handled this is just ridiculous and inappropriate.  I am warning you, beware of this restaurant and it's lack of customer service. I am sure they will be receiving a few more reviews from our party as soon as they recover from the heat and all the work they had to do that night. Ps- one server for 40 people is NEVER enough."}
{"text":"Went last night. Used to be one of the best pizzas in AZ. I ordered the funghi add sausage and it had less than 12 tiny mushroom slices on the whole thing and they weren't spectacular mushrooms. Mind you I don't mind a slightly burnt crust but this was too much the entire bottom was black. I'm sad to see one of my favorite pizza places losing its touch. I feel before you could tell they were passionate about pizza. Hope they turn it around."}
{"text":"Visited Cibo for the first time for dinner with my mom... ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! I started out with the desert blossom iced tea and enjoyed its flavorful taste a bunch! My mom loved her Pilsbury Wild Child wine.  I ordered the Linguini Pasta dish and my mom ordered the Fungi Pizza. Both dishes were presented beautifully, and tasted even better! We ended our wonderful meal with an awesome tasting crepe with cream, strawberries,and chocolate sauce! Lastly, the service was unbeatable! We were  greeted super nicely at the door, sat right away, and our waiter was with us almost immediately! Our food came out quickly and the restaurant was able to meet any requests on the order that we had:-) will definitely be dining here many times to come in the future!"}
{"text":"This is another one of my favorites. The pizzas are made in the classic thin-crust Italian style with gourmet pairings of ingredients. The ambiance is also a plus if you want to sit down and enjoy yourself for a little while. There's often live music on the patio, and the corner-home-turned-restaurant makes for a quaint and romantic setting in the heart of downtown near the arts district. Great date spot as long as it's not the first date, because you'll want to come back, and if the first date didn't go well, giving up the restaurant isn't worth it."}
{"text":"We had one night to spend in Phoenix, and I'm so glad we spent it here! Lovely patio with twinkle lights and live music. Everything we ate had high quality ingredients and tasted so lovely. Most enjoyable meal I've had in a while. We split the pesto salad for starters and then split the Da Vince pizza with Italian sausage added. For dessert we had the crepe with mascarpone. I would do it all again!"}
{"text":"First time here and was AWESOME! We had a party of 7 and reservations. Huge outdoor area with lighting and patio. Staff were friendly when we walked up and our waitress was quick and knew the menu. Had a 3 yr old w us very kid friendly. Had booster seats and gave her her apple juice in a plastic cup w lid. Food was great! Everything tastes fresh and homemade. Went all out, got rice mozzarella, meatball appetizers- delicious! Pizza and calzones were great! Also have to get the Crepe desert! Yum! Would def go back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place for a romantic dinner. The staff was really friendly. Options were great. Only \"not so great\" thing: asked the bartender for opinion between peach Bellini, limoncello or sambuca. I stated I wanted something fresh and light. He recommended the sambuca. I ordered it only to find it is like VERY strong liquid licorice. Not fresh at all. So spicy I got heartburn. Other than this, I loved the place! Wil be back!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. Bright & fresh. A great summer escape!
thank you"}
{"text":"I have been a couple of times but couldn't decide what I though of it until my third visit that happened this week.

I am going to start with the service which has always been ok. None of the servers that I have had have ever done anything that I would consider excellent but it has always been acceptable. This particular visit the server seemed put off by the fact that none of our party ordered alcohol (it was a work function) but she filled the water a couple of times and asked how the food was. Overall it has always be fine but nowhere near exceptional.

The first two times I went I tried different pasta dishes and they were tasty but nothing to write home (or Yelp) about. This visit that changed! I have always looked at the Mushroom Pizza every time that I have been there but never ordered it because more often than not this kind of dish isn't seasoned well and I am disappointed. I am thrilled that I decided to try it at Cibo because it was delicious. There was a perfect balance of mushrooms, a cream sauce, toasted hazel nuts and truffle oil. The crust was awesome too! Thin but not too crunchy but substantial enough to hold the toppings. The pizza was huge so I took half of the pizza with me and had it for lunch the next day.... It was still delicious.

That pizza was enough to take me back to Cibo again and again I wonder if it is part of the $5 pizza happy hour......"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend one night. The lights and the peaceful night would be great for a date. The sandwiches were great. My friend and I loved the fries!!! The pizza and the desert didn't really work for me. I will come back again with my gf another time. Sorry, I forgot the name of the food I ordered"}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service. I had a salad that was fantastic. My husband had the hot veggie sandwich. It was average at best. It tasted like it was reheated and the bread was slightly burned in places on the outside. The truffle fries were amazing and crispy."}
{"text":"We dined here on an overnight stay before catching an early flight out of Phoenix. We used Yelp's No-Wait feature and we able to secure a table with a short 25 minute wait! This place is located in a residential neighborhood in the downtown area. You can miss it....as the patio is beautiful and generously lit up with twinkle lights. Plus, you'll likely hear the live music as well. The atmosphere is super lively and as I mentioned, the patio is THE place to be.  The inside was a little loud. While the patio had live jazzy type music indoors was loud Rock. Again, lively, just in a different way. The menu is Italian and a-ok. My family is Italian...as in from Italy, so we're a little picky. We ordered the burrata- the toast it was accompanied with was very good. We also shared the calamari, which for my taste was too thickly battered. I prefer a light batter.The dipping sauce was excellent though!  We also dined on the Arugula salad with pear, a meat and cheese pizza, the Tartufata pizza which is a white sauce with mushrooms and truffles. And for dessert, we ordered the Zeppole (donut balls) served with a nutella dipping sauce. Who doesn't LOVE a donut ball with nutella? Well....they would have been perfect if they didn't taste like fryer oil. Other than that...they would have been excellent.

The service was friendly and attentive. Overall a sweet place."}
{"text":"Pizza reviews on Yelp are usually not all that helpful to me. There are too many different styles, preferences and expectations for comparing different pizza places. That being said, if you're looking for the \"artisanal\" style of pizza (small, relatively thin crust, simple but flavorful toppings, fired in a very hot wood oven), Cibo is a winner.

I love trying different pizza places (usually limiting myself to artisanal or new york style), and, for me the trinity of pizza perfection in Phoenix is Cibo, Bianco, and La Grande Orange (and NYPD if I need a lot of pizza). Bianco is great, but has long lines; La Grande Orange is a bit heavy on the toppings, but Cibo seems to get things just right for me.

Their crusts are flavorful, chewy around the outside, with just a slight bit of charring. However, the crust could stand to have a bit more structure toward the middle of the pizza (the crust will go limp if there are too many toppings). The toppings are fresh, flavorful, and of obviously high quality. If you want a pizza that is comparable to the legendary Bianco pizzas, Cibo is an excellent choice.

For dessert, try the strawberry (or banana) nutella crepes. The ambiance is great both inside and out, although the inside can get a bit loud. Also note that they allow you to order their pizza for pick-up."}
{"text":"Food was good but not 4 & 1/2 star worthy.  9 of us dined on Aug 5, Friday.  Considering the difficulty in finding parking spot, tight dinning areas and borderline uncomfortable temperature inside, it was not worth the visit.  For anyone considering Cibo, I would recommend POMO, downtown Phoenix, for pizza and EVO in Scottsdale for pasta."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for both lunch and dinner (separate menus for each).  The food is amazing and unique.  The atmosphere is quaint and intimate, perfect for date nights or dinner with close friends!  Service is not quick but the mood is relaxing and casual.  Never disappointed with this place!!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I've lived in Phoenix or 10 years and have just discovered Cibo!!  I went on a Saturday night and the wait for a party of 3 was less than 30 minutes!  The atmosphere out on the patio was amazing and there was also live music!  It didn't feel like I was in downtown Phoenix.

We ordered the pear salad, Diavola (add ricotta and garlic), and the special pizza of the night.  The special was a white pizza with broccoli rabe and sausage.  All the food was delicious but I must say that the Diavola with ricotta and garlic was out of this world!  

Now that I've FINALLY discovered this little gem, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with some coworkers last week. This place is adorable! I love when they turn old houses into little restaurants. I had the PLT sandwhich (Prosciutto, Lettuce, and Tomato). It had a spicy roasted red pepper aoili on it. It wasn't spicy to me but it was delicious. The bread the sandwiches come on is also amazing. I love good bread! I ordered my sandwich with the fruit salad as my side and was in love with it. It came with yogurt and granola on it and was more like a dessert, which I always love! Can't wait to bring my husband here and try it out for dinner!"}
{"text":"We had this place bookmarked for dinner since it was near our hotel. 

We would have loved to sit outside but it was way too hot at 5pm on a Sunday evening in early August when we swung by. If we ever visit Arizona again, I'd much rather sit outside, it looks so beautiful!

The pizza we ordered was pretty good! To start we had a Caprese salad, but it came with giant slices of fresh mozzarella and was a bit too filling. We had a couple glasses of wine with dinner and it was a pleasant and intimate experience. The restaurant is generally quiet and we were seated in a corner. Between 2 people we couldn't finish the pizza. Maybe the Caprese in the beginning wasn't a good idea.

I saw someone else at another table order the Calzone and that thing looked absolutely monstrous."}
{"text":"I really like Cibo especially because of the ambiance - it is just cute, quaint, and relaxed.  Waiting for your table, you can sit on a bench and listen to live music serenade you.  When you get inside, it is a little tight and cozy, but I didn't seem to mind it.  The food was good and I love their crust. The restaurant is located in downtown so you would have to try to find parking because there are many residential homes around the area."}
{"text":"We came down 5th and didn't know where to park - no valet was immediately visable and the streets were packed. We eventually found the valet behind the building but found a spot on the street at the same time so went with that.

The give you bread to share which was just ok. The pizzas were all overdone (the crust was burnt) otherwise it seemed like the crust would have been good. Also, some of the pizza toppings were poorly distributed. One had 2 slices with huge chunks of prosciutto but none on any of the other slices. Kind of annoying when you're splitting. The pizzas were all mediocre. I also found it irritating that they don't use those little elevated pizza holders. Our table was PACKED. It was hard to eat.

We split a bunch of desserts. I thought the tiramisu was ok but a little dense. If you hate Nutella you're pretty screwed on dessert because 80% of the dessert was heavily Nutella based. The strawberry and Nutella crepe was good, but the banana and Nutella not so much. It had way too much Nutella (which is saying a lot because I can eat Nutella by the spoonful). We also had the doughnut spheres (which were actually more like triangles... who cares but I thought it was weird that they called them spheres). They were not the best doughnut holes + dip that I've had.

The atmosphere was the high point - nice patio if a bit crowded and there was live music. I thought our service was not spectacular but sufficient."}
{"text":"Their pizza is fantastic. I try a different version during each visit. Have not had a bad one yet!

Try the marinara with mozzarella added. 

Not for those that have an aversion to anchovies!  Delicious."}
{"text":"This pizza place is awesome! It's set in a historic house in downtown Phoenix. The inside has great ambience, and they have a shaded patio when the weather is nicer. I love the spicy salami pizza and their homemade lemon cello is very delicious. Their pizzas are reasonably priced, and you get a pizza that can feed 1 to 2 people for about $14. They cook their pizzas in a wood fire oven, and even cook their sandwich bread in the oven. I would definitely recommend for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome place to enjoy the PHX weather outside on the patio. Come for happy hour where they have great food and drink deals (ends at 6pm) $2.50 peroni's and $4 wine."}
{"text":"I've had many excellent dinners at Cibo, and tonight's was no exception.  We started with the Antipasto Speciale, which was extraordinarily fresh and flavorful.  Likewise, the Capricciosa pizza was delicious... no complaints whatsoever about the food.  I've never had an appetizer or a pizza at Cibo that I didn't thoroughly enjoy.

The experience is normally quite pleasant as well -- tonight, we were greeted very courteously by one of the owners and seated shortly thereafter.  Our service was rather lackluster and inattentive, but this fortunately doesn't seem to be a normal occurrence.  I look forward to visiting Cibo again upon my next visit to Phoenix, hopefully to try their new weekend breakfast!"}
{"text":"Yes, another gutted house-turned restaurant/ bar to no prevail succeeds. Yippie-Skippie.

It's walking distance from work, so thats 5 badass red stars right there. Then, I almost gave it 1 star thinking it was closed and realized that it is 112 out today and no one was on the patio. Who doesn't like sweat dripping on their Pastrami? And thats exactly what I had. Good shit. It ran me a little over 18 bucks for lunch with 2 Ambers. 

Go ahead and take someone \"out-of-town\" aka Scottsdale, to show them the advantages of knowing places like this downtown.

To my dispair, with everything being \"authentic\", they had a sensored-run paper towel machine in the restroom. Weak sauce."}
{"text":"The best gluten free pizza I've had! I think the difference is they make their crust in house. I've tried a lot of gluten free pizza in the LA area but I guess the place to go to get my gf pizza fix is in Phoenix, AZ now. 

We went on a Friday evening and it was pretty quick to get seated inside for a party of 4. They estimated it would take 30 minutes to get seated but it was much sooner than that."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for lunch and sat outside. The atmosphere was great; there are many trees for shade and privacy. The food was delicious and our server was very knowledgeable and helpful. We will definitely go back to Cibo and we would recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"One of my faves, our go to meeting spot before events in PHX. Love the patio and restaurant, and I would choose their salad/pizza/pasta over other top rated joints in the Valley anyday."}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars if the service was better. The food was delicious but our server kept disappearing and we mostly had other staff help us whenever we could find someone. The pizza was delicious, but our favorite dish was the pappardelle in bolognese sauce- my mouth is watering now thinking about it! The dessert crepes were decent, I wish they were more unique with their toppings for the crepes."}
{"text":"my boyfriend and I actually prefer chibo over bianco and not just because we only have to wait half as long at chibo but because the pizza is just better! The crust is just the right combination of crunchy and soft. The sauce was amazing it was not as sweet as I ususally prefer but it really worked with the sausage. This was an amazing experience for us and will pass up bianco any day to eat at cibo!

OH!! and thanks to the waitress for not being rude when I walked out after leaving $30.00 on a $30.87 bill oooops! I don't know how I managed that! I thought I had left $36.00! I'll use my debt/credit card from now on lol! She just caught us walking out to the car to let me know I hadn't left enough to cover my bill."}
{"text":"Cibo is a really adorable place, but I can't say that I think it is extraordinary.  The atmosphere and ambiance is totally five star, but too much goes wrong after that to give it an overall five star.  

Food stuff:  I've been twice and both times I liked it, but it wasn't love.  We got the bruscetta plate and I wasn't really thrilled.  The traditional tomato one was the most solid choice, the bean one was strange and soggy and I don't eat pig so I can't comment on the third one (though everyone else seemed to enjoy it). The pizzas are pretty decent except that they lay out the toppings in a weird way, for example, if you order the vegetarian rosa pizza, if you like zucchini, it is all chopped up on two slices and so on.  It doesn't really make sense to top a pizza in such a way, to me.  I prefer draft beer over bottled beer, and all they offer is bottled.  I did enjoy a couple glasses of the Rossi Cabernet Sauvignon which was a solid wine choice.

Service:  The host/ess was a pleasant person, and the time quoted was less than we actually had to wait so that rocked.  While waiting, we attempted to get a drink.  The bartender was cool about getting our drinks in a timely manner despite the fact that it was busy.  Our actual server was super attentive at first and then lost for a good chunk of time as well.  Too hit or miss.  

Cibo is an adorable spot with awesome ambiance but it isn't quite that awesome when it comes to food and service."}
{"text":"My bf surprised me with Sunday evening reservations...

Love the decor; very loft-like and open-concept.

We were seated upstairs, across from the upstairs bar. We sat for 10-15 minutes before being aknowleged. Finally the bartender came over, and we realized that he was our server. It would have been great if one of the 10 servers that were just standing around gossiping would have pitched in and brought us water, or taken a drink order...

We had some apps to share. They were great. I ordered the halibut. My date ordered a pizza. My main came, there was no pizza to be found. I literally finished the halibut (of course I shared with my bf), then we sat and looked at each other for 15 minutes, and then his pizza finally arrived. Seriously. The timing is WAY off. Both dishes were great. I mean the pizza was top 2 out of all the pizza I have ever had in my life. Seasoning was beautiful, but really? 15 minutes after I finished my dinner?!!

Cody was our server/bartender, and he was very gracious. While I was waiting for my bf to finish his meal, I was watching the kitchen staff, and I literally watched one of the chefs blow his nose on some paper towel, then he wiped his hands on his apron, and continued with prep. The same guy was also snacking on the line the whole time... Gross. I used to work in a hospital, and every time you touch your face or your mouth, you must wash your hands. Common sense. Food prep? Even more so. Again. Effing gross.

The food is 5 stars. Service 4 stars. Timing 2 stars. Hygeine 0 stars. I figure 3 stars is about the average, but hopefully, they work these kinks out in the weeks to come, and fire the cook with the arm-band tattoo with no regard to hygeine."}
{"text":"I joined a girlfriend for a few appies and wine on a Friday night. Here are my pros and cons!

The Good:
-Prices were reasonable (e.g., a $5 dessert and $5.50 glass of prosecco) - awesome, especially for 17th Ave.
-The share approach is awesome, and the small portions of appies served in small bowls was a nice way to try a variety of flavors. I particularly enjoyed the lamb meatballs, and my friend loved the ricotta with pine nuts. And olives. Yummy olives.
-The space is beautiful. Location, also awesome, with a parking lot right beside it.
-The patio space looks gorgeous. I wasn't lucky enough to get out there, but I want to.
-We were running late for our reservation, and when I called the girl who answered was very polite and helpful. Super accommodating and helpful, which I really appreciated.

The Not as Good:
-Service was inconsistent. For example, I sat alone for 5+ minutes until my friend joined me, with no acknowledgement from a server. Moreover, things like dessert and our bill were slow to arrive. At other points in the service, we were checked up on too frequently.
-The dessert, a chocolate brownie-type thing with salted caramel, arrived - and had some of the worst plating ever. It looked like it had been plopped on a plate and ladled with sauce - although it was yummy I was really disappointed with the presentation. It wasn't the way I'd prefer to remember the restaurant.
-The space was loud and giant - I felt like I was in a huge hall instead of a comfortable dining room. Although the decor was great, the ambiance left something to be desired.
-As noted by another reviewer, both the flimsy (and oil stained) menus and the very informally dressed staff were a bit underwhelming. 

Overall, I felt really \"meh\" about it. I love Bonterra and am optimistic that these guys can iron out some of the kinks to be a stronger place (because how great would to Bonterras be?!). 

I'm hoping to (want to) try it again, and maybe enjoy a main dish, which both looked and sounded awesome. I suspect (hope) that will bump my rating up by another star. ;)"}
{"text":"I am giving this place five stars because the food was absolutely amazing!! The pizza and pasta was perfection!! 

Our service was horrible but I'm hoping that it was just that our waitress was having a rough night. 

We would definitely go back.... maybe just make sure we have a different waitress."}
{"text":"Great wine list and really like the Pizza Di Norte. Try the T&K salad with oranges and gorgonzola."}
{"text":"I love their Burrata cheese, it is to die for, and of course their pizza's are amazing! Nice patio seating is a plus, and it's not too hard to find good parking in the area."}
{"text":"When I choose a restaurant, essentially I am asking for good service as well as a great meal. At Cibo, it was a terrific experience from the moment we entired the old Craftsmen home that served us great Napoli Italian food! 

Our server, Matt appeared immediately gleaming in his RUN-DMC t-shirt and I was ready to rap myself in great food from the beginning. The mozarella appetizer was delightful as was the antipasto. My mushroom pizza was thin crusted and delicious, and our guests from North Carolina were impressed. 

Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"Slow \"put upon\" service and mediocre pizza served cold. Can't understand all the good buzz around this place."}
{"text":"We came to Cibo on a Friday night with the family and order the rotisserie sirloin, the manzo and a Caesar salad. The food tasted like 80% came straight out of a can. 

The beef in my dish (manzo), was dry and not flavourful and the sauce tasted the most artificial out of the whole dish. Now I never tried the sirloin myself but my step dad did spend about 5 mins straight chewing it. The sirloin had more in common with hubbabubba then a cow. The Caesar salad was probably the best dish we received with my biggest complaint being liquorice flavoured croutons . 

The reason I didn't give 1 star was because the staff was very friendly and the environment was pretty fun. The noise was more on the loud side because the building is pretty big! May I suggest adding baffles?"}
{"text":"Cibo...oh how I want to love you.

The atmosphere is great.  A cozy little house in downtown phoenix.  Lots of red brick.  Wood fired pizza oven.  Vines and fountains.  A truly awesome and relaxing patio.  4 to 5 stars.

The menu is wonderful.  Lots of variety.  Pricing is fair.  Interesting combinations are offered.  Thoughtful and well put together.  A solid 4 stars.

The execution was fair at best.  The pizza was overcooked.  Burned on the bottom.  It was bland.  Our appetizers were not great.  2 Stars.

EDITED - Note: I received a great email from Karen at Cibo regarding my review above.  She was VERY gracious and it was great to see such a personal touch and high level of customer service.  Thumbs up on the follow up on this. They obviously care greatly about there customers.  I think I will give em a 2nd chance...Thanks Karen."}
{"text":"Really good pizza place in downtown Phoenix. It is a bit more trendy than just a \"pizza joint.\" The food is fantastic. Everything is made fresh and in house. Really enjoy eating there!"}
{"text":"I really like the ambiance of the place and was super hopeful about the food.  I have heard so many great things about this place.  I tried the Margherita pizza and the flavor just wasn't there.  The sauce was bland, the crust was super soggy, they didn't have any powdered garlic.  Just not what I was looking for in a great pizza.  We tried two of the appetizers and they also left a lot to be desired.  1 was the fried pizza crust...it lacked flavor and the other was a fried ball of cheese and white rice which was horrible.  The two stars are for the service and the ambiance.  I wouldn't go back for the food."}
{"text":"I've gone to Cibo 3 times now and each time, I said, maybe it's just an off night, let's see if it's better next time.... I prefer writing positive reviews, but I have to say, what is the big buzz about this place?  What am I missing?  

The place is pretty busy for a Wednesday evening.  We had reservations for 2.  We sat at 7.  We were greeted within 5 minutes and placed drink orders.  Our waters came 5 minutes later.... our one beer and one glass of prosecco came at 7:18pm.  We decided to place our dinner entrees, so not to get caught behind huge parties.  

So thankfully, I can pull teeth to make conversation, but dang the wait was long and I did not appreciate having to be dragged longer on an already not-so-great date. (haha, that's another story).  Our food arrived after 8:00pm.  It's one thing if it's extremely busy, but the server never came to check in on us or apologize for the hold up, or see if we wanted an appetizer 'til then.... ;-/

The Capricciosa pizze rosse and bolognese were all we ordered.  You would think after the long wait that I would devour into this and think it tastes amazing..... I guess I was disappointed.  The food wasn't as hot as I'd like it, but felt like it might have been sitting under a heat lamp for too long.  The center of the pizza's crust was soggy.  And yes, I appreciate and know the differences between napolean and sicilian style pizzas.  My pizza's toppings seemed sparse, too.  

On a good note, the bolognese pasta was delicious.  Thin wide noodles cooked al dente paired with a good serving of meaty red sauce.  Love the chunky tomatoes.  Great herb seasoning and not too salty.  Very tasty, but again, semi-warm.  

And to not completely knock the service, our server asked if we wanted their spicy oil - I asked what that was, she gave a good description, which I tried.... that was a nice dipping sauce for my cold crusted pizza.  

By this point, I didn't want to stay around longer to dry the desserts... so hopefully, next time it'll be better!?"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Phoenix! Love the atmosphere, wonderful food and great service."}
{"text":"Cute, romantic ambience. Delicious pizza. What more could you want? Unfortunately at 10pm on a Friday night, there was a wait to sit outside so we settled for sitting inside. Sit outside if you can, it's like a scene from a movie out there. 

Cibo pizzas are Pauline P. sized pizzas. I'm a girl with a pretty sizable appetite and these pizzas left me feeling full and satisfied. Ordered the magherita and added italian sausage to it. Everything was great, even the crust and I'm generally not a crust girl. Basil was fresh and the sausage tasted excellent. Our server was well-versed in the menu and knew exactly what she was talking about. She recommended to get half of the Di Notte and half of the Tartufata since my friend was wanting a pizza bianche but was unsure of what to get. She also hooked it up with this spicy oil to dip our pizza crusts in - yum!"}
{"text":"This past weekend my good friend recommended Cibo to me because I'm a huge fan of pizza! So I said let's give it a shot.

Cibo is located in a residential area so parking is limited around the neighborhood. As walked up to the restaurant I became very impressed with outside seating setup. Very intimate with a romantic feel. 

When I walked in to be seated I was greeted right away. This is always a plus for me. The setup inside is nice. There are dinning areas in each room of the house with awesome art work hanging from the walls.

Now for the main attraction! The PIZZA WAS THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD!!. He waitress was very kind and helpful. She made great recommendations and I was also impressed with the cheese ball appetizers. I really love cheese... Lol. The pizza was cooked to perfection. I had one side that was a kind of cheese pepperoni and the other covered in bruschetta. Awesome choice I really recommend. 

I will defiantly be back to donate more money!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Parking was a bit tricky but once we found a spot it was a quick walk to the restaurant. We were seated promptly and our very friendly waitress took our orders. I ordered the Margherita and it was really good! The basil was super fresh, not at stale that you get at most places. 

For dessert we ordered the Nutella Crepe. I personally DO NOT like Nutella or thought that I didn't but in a crepe....this was so delicious! I could have eaten about fifty of those damn crepes. I highly recommend saving room for dessert. It's so worth it."}
{"text":"Yummy little place; a few rough edges but worth checking out. Not too expensive (and BYOB helps).

We headed in after 8:30 on a Friday after encountering a long wait list at D's; Cibo could seat us right away so we went for it. They were out of a few menu items, which I think is acceptable for a small place just a few weeks in. 

The menu has a small variety of items - starters, soup/salad, and entrees (including several pasta entrees). I was tempted by the veal but since I've never yet had good veal in the US I decided on the Vongole pasta. It was way spicier than I expected but the preparation was otherwise good. (I also had the \"surprisingly spicy\" problem at La Cucina Flegrea, where Cibo's chef trained, so that's consistent!)

Highlight of the night was the arancini balls I ordered as a starter - really good, mild cheesy flavor, good texture with a slightly crispy outside, and dressed with beautiful fresh tasting tomato sauce. (I haven't tasted sauce that good since Roberto's moved out of town.)

Rough edges: 
- The plates are too big for the tables. We had trouble fitting all our dishes on our 4-person table and there were only 3 of us.
- It's awfully loud. (Legume had the same problem in a really similar space, and they dealt with it a few months after opening.)
- Service was good but seemed uncertain about what they should be doing. There was a lot of conversation and confusion over things like when to clear plates. Could be opening month jitters.
- Beans & Greens - the version we had was way too salty, and the greens were left too long for how stringy they ended up being. The salt was overwhelming. They use meat in this dish, which the server warned us; could be that the salted ham they used that night was just too much, but still, they really should have adjusted.

All in all, it's a decent place with some great dishes and lots of promise. Will definitely be back.

P.S. The waiter said Cibo is pronounced chee-bo, in case you never studied Italian and were wondering."}
{"text":"What an amazing dining experience!!! 
I had visited Cibo prior to the change and thought it was good, but now it is awesome. 
My wife, three friends, and I visited cibo over the weekend and can't stop talking about it. 

As a group, we decided to eat family style, so everyone could try everything we ordered, and it al was GREAT!!! We couldn't decide which dishes were our favorites!! 
But I will say the mussels appetizer is still tantalizing my tastebuds. My cream sauce was amazing, and I just wanted to bath in it. Dipping the wonderful grilled Texas toast in the sauce...words can't even describe. 

We also tried many of the entrees, butternut squash raviolis, porcini pappardelle, lamb, rabbit, & the chicken (which chef Jen sent out complimentary). All 5 were awesome!!! It's really hard to determine which was best, but if I forced I'd say it was the raviolis. 

It was also a wonderful touch that chef Jen came and sat at our table and chatted with us for a while. The staff was very attentive and provided wonderful service. 
Thank you Cibo for a wonderful night out"}
{"text":"So I am beginnin to think that there is something better about restaurants in Phoenix.  Yeah, I'm a Scottsdale girl, I admit it, but I  tend to think Scottsdale is a pretty beige place a lot of the time.  Not a lot of character see?  And that is what some restaurants in Phoenix have  - character.  And I think that is one of the things I like about Cibo.  First off, it is in this weird little neighborhood in downtown Phoenix and a little hard to get to if you don't figure out the one way street thing and wind up going down a street the wrong way.  Not too good an idea.  Then there is the fact that ya kinda wonder if your car will be up on blocks when you come out because of the neighborhood.  But Cibo is in a little 1920s bungalow and absolutely charming.  Another great date place!  Shrubs with those little white Xmas lights in them all around the old brick patio, cool old trees outside and the inside is pretty vintage-y too (I made that word up).. I have never eaten inside as the weather has been so darn great everytime I have been there that the patio is where I have wound up.  Anyhoo, on to the food- I think it is great.  I was suggested that I have their white pizza and add red sauce and it was amazing.  Lotsa cheese, gooey, and you could tell that the crust was made there, not prepacked and frozen or something like that. Seriously, that is the only kind I have had there so far and I have been there about 4 x.  Pretty sad...I should try other stuff but once I find something good... 'nuf said.  Their salad with fresh figs was great too.  Add a glass (ok, a bottle) of red wine and you are set.  Oh, and I think that it is the owner who hangs by the door outside and helps with the seating, which btw I think is a great touch.  Whenever an owner cares enough to be there and watch out for the place and assist, I think that is always a good sign.  Obviously the kitchen is doing good without her being back there! :)


Only one thing that I wish they would change/add:  different desserts?  I like Nutella but in everything?  There has gotta be something else you can do?  Buy?  Import? Just a thought....

I just wish that they would move that little house up north so that I can actually enjoy the evening without worrying about the looonggg drive back to Scottsdale..but I guess that is my problem!"}
{"text":"I'm very lucky to live right across the street from here. I think this is the local favorite when it comes to Napolentana style pizza. Bianco can stay with the tourists. I love coming home from work and smelling the wood burning from the brick oven, walking over and having an expresso at the bar or finishing the meal with an amazing limoncello. The staff are great people and the ambiance is second to none. The gnocchi is on special on Tuesdays and is absolutely to die for. Great and impressive date night.  And they have a pet!"}
{"text":"Good Italian food with great selection of wine; the restaurant is spacious and a bit on the louder side. It is just located in the heart of 17th avenue, great location; parking is in the back side and most of the time packed but you should be able to find a spot on the street."}
{"text":"Seriously one of my favorite places to eat for date night. Very romantic vibe and excellent food. The service is paced for a dining experience, so don't expect to go in rushing to eat. 

Great wine, food, ambiance and service. Nothing but great things happening here!"}
{"text":"After reading all the favorable reviews, we decided to make reservation for our party of 7 one month in advance.  The restaurant is located in downtown Phoenix to what looks to be a residential neighborhood.  It is ranked as one of the top first date places and the ambience is very romantic.   It reminds me of one of those restaurants that you stroll across with a beachfront dining in some romantic resort town.  

We ordered a total of 5 pizza's, 2 appetizers, and 3 desserts for our party.  The pizza's were phenomenal, much better than the other place that has a wait of 3 hours.  The pizza's that stood out were the one with truffle oil and a red spicy sauce with ham.  Sorry, I don't have the names of the pizza's as I let my friends do the ordering.   

Be sure to save room for dessert!  We ordered 3 crepes (nutella with banana, cr√®me cheese, and fresca).  Each was delicious.  Upon leaving we were stuffed, but left with the satisfaction that this was one of the best pizza's we've ever had.  The service was great,  our waiter provided some really good tips and recommendations.  We'll be back on our next Giants Spring Training trip!!"}
{"text":"Why am I updating my review?  Dessert!  It finally happened!

I really enjoy introducing people to places they have never been, and I am happy to say Cibo recently gained two new fans of their charming outdoor patio and good food.

The three of us arrived just before the 5pm opening to ensure we could secure a table on the patio and enjoy the gorgeous first evening of Spring outside.  Everything we tried was fantastic, and I had the opportunity to sample two new-to-me dishes, the burrata appetizer (I have no words to describe how special and good this mozzarella is, especially when combined with the salty prosciutto, and a drizzle of aged basalmic) and dessert!       

After selecting a chianti and the burrata, we decided to share two pizzas among us - the margherita and the rustica.  Both were excellent, with that slightly doughy wood-fired crust I love so much.

Ah, the dessert.  I think the trick to getting dessert with any meal is dining with guys.  There is no dainty \"oh no, I just couldn't eat another bite\" but rather \"which one do you want?\".  I like that.  We chose the Nutella and Marscapone cheese crepe, which was topped with a light dusting of powdered sugar and chocolate sauce.  So good, so worth waiting for - like hot chocolate, but on a plate.  Manners and politeness went out the door as our three forks fought for position.  I believe insults were thrown.  It is all fun and games until you get between me and some warm Nutella.  Back away slowly and you won't get hurt...  ;)"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!! The spicy salami is so good. The 3 bruschettas are so good and what a cool old house to be inside. You can feel the history. Such a great experience all around."}
{"text":"Love love love the food! I came here with my cousin about a month ago. It was slow, around lunch hour. We got sat in a corner and seemed abandoned. I think the server saw us and thought \"Oh those young girls are not going to tip anyways.\" I am actually a server and tip over 30% when I have good service because I know how it is. I would like to be treated/served the same way as a 40 year old looking business woman. Customer service, horrible."}
{"text":"Cibo was good, but I'll admit nothing was really outstanding. We went as a group of 5 and shared five appetizers (scodellina), as well as 2 pastas plus a pizza. The prices were comparable to other places, but the only thing that REALLY blew my taste buds was the eggplant dip. I'm not a pasta person but they weren't really anything special in my opinion, and I'd had better pizza the night before at Beer Revolution. 

The decor is pretty cool, though.

One side remark: Their servers wear casual dress (i.e. no dress code) which turns me off a little - I'd like to be able to tell the servers apart from the patrons at a glance. 

All in all, I'd go back if a friend organized a group of people to go or really wanted to visit, but it wouldn't be top of my list of places to consider going back to."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place! So glad I live close by. Waiter suggested the pizza with no sauce called Di Notte and it has become my favorite!!"}
{"text":"Sweet Pea and I decided to have a relaxing night at Cibo last weekend, as we often do when we feel like just staying close to home, walking, and having insanely good pizza.  I'd been craving a good pizza to get the bad taste of The Parlor out of my mouth for a few weekends now, and Cibo is our favorite.  We've been here dozens of times, and it never disappoints.
It was a perfect night for waiting outside, and it's a good thing, because when we got there at about 7pm on a Saturday night, the wait was already an hour and a half.  Man, I miss those days of not waiting.  I only hope that this place doesn't become the next Bianco.  At any rate, an hour and a half passes quickly with good wine and prosecco, and a table outside on a beautiful night, and we were seated outside on the patio in no time.
We did our usual- our own salads (I have to always get the Caprese which is the best I've ever had with fresh tomatoes, delicious fresh mozzarella, and just enough pesto), and splitting a pizza- half diavolo for him, and half margherita for me.  He swears by the diavolo- being a pepperoni lover, he's obviously a fan of cured meats, but says this is way better than pepperoni.  Margherita is always so good with the sauce, just enough mozzarella, and whole basil leaves.  Then the usual desserts- the fresca for him which is a huge heaping crepe full of fresh fruit, vanilla ice cream, and whipped cream, and the crepe Suzette for me, which comes flaming.  Crepe Suzette is my favorite dessert, and Cibo does it as well as any Parisian restaurant I've been to.
I hate to Yelp it so high because it really is that good, and I hate waiting.  But Cibo deserves it.  It is, bar none, the best pizza in town.  And the atmosphere doesn't suck either."}
{"text":"So much better than Pizzaria Bianco! The food is excellent, as is the service and price. My hubby and I always go when we have friends or family in from out of town. Don't leave without trying the bruschetta. The pizza is flavorful and interesting. Once we were there and there was an awful guitarist which was really unpleasant. Other than that, excellent!"}
{"text":"I didn't have a big appetite and wasn't really into stopping at a restaurant that my girlfriend wanted to go to cause she went there a few years ago. I'm glad we stopped. The place is located at the end of a neighborhood. It was so odd going through residential (or maybe those businesses that look like little houses) streets and arriving at the restaurant. 

Cibo's a really cute place and it is probably super popular. The patio, at night, I can imagine is hopping and it is set up to accommodate a good amount of people (from what I remember, this was after driving 10 hours from Austin to Santa Fe and then another 8 from Santa Fe to Mesa). 

We went in the dead of the afternoon, way past lunch, and the staff was hanging out in one room and we were by ourselves in the other room. Cute place. Repetitive but it is legitimately an intriguing atmosphere because it teeters between cute and cool. I had some thin margarita pizza and I remember being a little disappointed in that the pizza itself was a little on the soggy doughy side. 

Girlfriend had... I don't remember what but she did order a huge chocolate crepe for dessert. That monster was super rich and sweet and I think at least 3 people can share it. If I wasn't staring at another 10 hour drive, I think it would have gone really well with a nice espresso. 

I would definitely recommend people to check out Cibo."}
{"text":"Unique and wonderful food. Service could use some improvement in friendly.  Otherwise great find!"}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed this place! Parking was a bit of a problem but sitting outside with lights on the true was very sweet. We shared a Genova pizza which was absolutely perfect in flavor and size. Not a white pizza but a no sauce pizza. This is a house made into a restaurant that has a lot of character. I will definitely be putting this back on my go to list for a second try."}
{"text":"Popped in yesterday for a quick lunch and sat at the bar.

There seemed to be some sort of tour going on when I arrived so it was a little confusing walking in the door and having a group of people standing there with beers in their hands. The bartender quickly came over and asked if I needed a seat.

They have a $16 \"choose your own adventure\" style lunch menu as well as their standard menu. As enticing as all the options were on the lunch menu I chose to go with their arugula salad and added a flatiron steak. 

The salad was large in terms of how salads go. This is on purpose though as the menu items here are designed to be shared. The salad was tasty and light and hit the spot. The bartender didn't ask how I wanted my steak done so I'm not sure if there's an option. The steak was cooked to medium rare which is just the way I would have asked anyway.

The only miss here for me was that they only had 4 draught beer selections from their normal offering. I went with a Village Wit, which is always a good option for me, but I had wanted the Phillips White Peach Ale to pair with my salad."}
{"text":"Location and surroundings very nice, good pizza"}
{"text":"This great little find in CenPho is worth the drive, for me, atleast.

I popped in here with my dad last week (thanks to the glowing reviews on Yelp) and tried it out for lunch. 

It was tough to find, as it feels like you're just cruising through purely residential areas when all of the sudden one of the old victorian houses has a humbly posted \"Cibo\" sign on the corner. 

The decor is fantastic. It feels like you're in an old restaurant in northern California with clever ornamentation. The menu was a little confusing, and apparently there are some limitations on the lunch menu as compared with dinner, but we thought we were ordering pizzas and somehow ended up with sandwiches. This wasn't really a problem though, since these sandwiches were exceptionally tasty and served on pizza bread. 

Definitely a great find and a new item on the list of places to take out of town visitors."}
{"text":"Pizza and salads for dinner, sandwiches and salads for lunch - what's not to love?

We love brining people here. The atmosphere is great and when the weather is nice you can sit outside!  (It's a little too dark to see the menus but the atmosphere is great.)

We usually get the margherita pizza. For lunch I get the smoked salmon sandwich.  Both are yummy!"}
{"text":"I had such great hopes for this place. I love the fact that this restaurant is a restored craftsman home in downtown Phoenix with a great patio area.  We went there on a Saturday night and the waited  for an hour for a table while being able to meet the friendly owners. We ended up with a small table on the patio. Our waiter was half attentive to us throughout the night. The thin pizza crust was not as crispy as we would have like it. My husband's pizza was on the salty side. My pizza with spicy salami was good, not the best pizza ever.  After all the great things I've heard about this place, I was a little disappointed with the food. I wish the great atmosphere was matched with great food. I'd say it's a really nice place to hang out with friends for some wine and pizza while supporting a local business."}
{"text":"One of the best, if not the best pizza in all of Phoenix in my opinion.  It is very similar to the more famous Bianco style of pizza, however way less of  a wait.  Every pizza I've had from Cibo is excellent.  The decor and atmosphere is fantastic and perfect for a romantic date.  

They have a great outdoor area and on a nice night when the weather is right, you can't ask for a more perfect/romantic setting.  

Just so you know, if you are in the mood for some pizza for lunch, this isn't your place.  Pizza is only served at dinner and I think it's only sandwiches and salads for lunch.  I recommend it all though!"}
{"text":"Absolutely DELICIOUS. Aside from food though, the decor inside was cozy and beautiful. Very cute and warm, lit up for holidays. I came here with a large party. The service was great. We got appetizer boards and bottles of wine to start. I was never without a full glass. Now, I am from NY, and I loved my personal pizza I got here. The best pizza I've tried since being in AZ thus far. I got the basil pesto pie with roasted potatoes and mozzarella cheese, ate every last bite. Then I had the Nutella dessert. I wish I had photos to show. I will definitely be coming back, I already told my boyfriend it seems like the perfect date night spot."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and still cant get over the fact that this pizza place does not serve pizza during lunch!! 

My sandwich Ai Formaggi (see pics) was good but it wasn't anything that wowed me, I wasn't craving it later, I didn't dream about it, in fact it's like it never even happened. 

I still cant help bit wonder how the pizza is though, but since they don't serve it during lunch I guess I'll never know."}
{"text":"I keep meaning to review this place.  Every time I go, as I'm sitting, devouring what I have proclaimed \"might be my favorite pizza, ever.\", I commit to reviewing Cibo, but somehow, in my post-pizza bliss, I forget.  Not this time!  Time to give credit where credit is due.

Cibo is 100% adorable... the repurposed old house, the charming patio, the live music in the evenings.... just adorable.  It's small(ish) but I think that's part of it's charm.  Somehow we've been lucky and never had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated, even on Friday and Saturday evenings.  (By the way... this is one of the main reasons I prefer Cibo over the highly-touted Pizzaria Bianco).  

Antipasti-- I've had both the pear salad and the caprese salad and both are delicious.  Of the two, the pear salad is my favorite-- the honey adds an interesting element that compliments the rest of the salad nicely.  

Pizza- La Noce is what I'm referring to as \"might be my favorite pizza, ever.\".  I love the flavor of the arugula, ricotta, and walnuts-- and the red sauce is perfect.-- an interesting blend of flavors that just works I've also tried the Pomodoro Fresco-- also delicious, but La Noce is still my favorite.  Others I've eaten with have ordered other pizzas as well and all have proclaimed them fabulous. The crust is perfectly done, thin without being soggy.  

Service- The service is reliably good-- not amazing or remarkable, but good.  No issues here.  

So if you like awesome pizza in an adorable atmosphere and you don't want to wait ages, this is your place.  Just do it-- you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Went to Cibo with a few friends and shared a pizza. It was so awesome! The waitresses were nice and respectful and if I'm in downtown again ill definitely go back! The pizza sauce was fresh and the crust tasted like heaven!!"}
{"text":"Aside from the fact that this place is absolutely adorable, especially the outdoor seating, the food and service are amazing.  Our daughter has a pretty severe gluten allergy and our waitress was so attentive to her needs and assured us that her food would be made in a separate area to avoid gluten contamination.  So, total evidence that the service is above and beyond.  But, besides that.....the food is just so, so good.  The GF pizza is probably the best we've had and we've had A LOT.  It tastes as close to \"normal\" pizza as we've ever had.  So thankful to have a restaurant that makes it enjoyable for everyone in our family in spite of the food allergies.  If you haven't been here.....GO!  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Whether it's date night or girls dinner night I find myself wanting to go to Cibo.  The ambiance, the food, the pleasant staff, and the happy hour is what keeps me coming back.  The selection of decadent crepes is the cherry on top."}
{"text":"Was in phoenix visiting my bro early November. We had planned to eat at Breadfruit which is a jamaican restaurant nearby. The  wait was too long so we opted for Cibos.  Wow.  Must say i was impressed.  Lively atmospher. Fantastic food and wine.  Melissa was a great server. 

We had some wine at the bar for an hour then got our seat outside.  Perfect night with great food and service with a fun  atmosphere.  I now tell everyone to check out Cibos if in Az.   The people working here also love dining at Breadfruit.  It's refreshingly cool to see local businesses support each other.  This place is a converted house.  Thanks Cibos for a great saturday night."}
{"text":"took my mom, grandma, and the mrs. here for the kickoff to my birthday weekend. my family doesn't experience much downtown (they're *gag* scottsdale) so i chose cibo as the perfect introduction to the wonderful cuisine and atmosphere cen pho offers. 

went at 6pm on a friday night and the wait wasn't bad - maybe 15-20 minutes. it wasn't too crowded in there so we managed to huddle around the bar and have a drink and chat for a bit before we were seating. i had almost forgotten how absolutely charming this place was - you feel very at home inside, and it makes for a comfortable meal and dining experience.

although the service wasn't as good as i expected it to be - our waiter disappeared for long periods of time and didn't check on us very often - it wasn't bad enough to the point of knocking the place down a star. 

first up came the bread and olive oil, and when we asked for butter, we were denied because they didn't have any. what restaurant doesn't have butter? we ordered two salads to share - the house salad and the pear salad. both were superb. the large chunks of parmigiano  on the house salad were tasty as was the balsamic dressing - not too much and not too little - just right. we went with two pizzas, a red and a white. the capriciossa and the other one i forgot the name (it had fontina cheese and pepperoni, and it's not on the online menu). the white pizza was definitely  my favorite, as i am not a fan of pizza with a lot of toppings. i just can't get over how delicious these pizzas are - the crispy wood-fired crust and the cheesiest of cheeses - cooked to perfect. we couldn't leave without desert, and settled on the nutella and fresca. both were to die for; i prefered the fruitiness of the fresca to the somewhat overly sweet nutella. 

oh how i heart your pizza, cibo. no need to try pizzeria bi-crappo, you treat me and my taste buds perfectly."}
{"text":"Very nice Pizza, I like the ambiance. The arancini is a little bit tasteless."}
{"text":"Been here twice, both times for a weekday lunch. On my first visit, I tried a thin crust pizza. On my second visit, I tried the lunch special, combining 3 small courses: pulled pork sandwich, wild boar salad, bruschetta with a white cheese. The food was delicious but the place is just a tad noisier than I like."}
{"text":"The ingredients in every salad, pizza, and calzone are top quality. The patio, live music, and actual restaurant add to the wonderful experience as well. I will say I do prefer their simpler pizzas on the menu and think they do a better job executing those but I've never had a bad experience here from the service to the food."}
{"text":"fantastic place to visit in vacation. we ended up loving the sharable sizes of everything. party of 4 ended up getting 3 pizzas, 2 salads, 1 app, all to share. we loved every one of the dishes. simply amazing!"}
{"text":"Dog friendly! Nice patio seating, inside seating feels a bit more cramped. The food was decent, I do not rememberable having anything that swept me off my feet with wow factor. The atmosphere is what sells here, the patio is nice in the evenings and light up with white outdoor Christmas lighting, or something along those lines."}
{"text":"Its a perfect place for dinner. There is live music n we choose outdoor seating. We ordered half n half pizza both were vegetarian they have gluten free pizza extra 3$. I and my husband loved gluten free pizza.
Specially for vegetarians its wonderful place u have lot of options.service is good and fast."}
{"text":"Slightly expensive but worth every dime, especially when the weather is right and you sit on their beautiful patio, lit by string lights and filled with the sounds of their beautiful fountains. Perfect place to take a date or have a special and unforgettable evening. 

Their wood fired pizzas are small but their ingredients are fresh and pair deliciously with a bottle of wine or a Peroni. This place fills up fast though so definitely make reservations if you're hoping to get a table at night."}
{"text":"I've had the opportunity to come once again, to Cibo. Upon first glance, it's small, intimate with the essence of a true Italian pizzeria. We were first greeted by the hostess, then shown to our table. Once we sat down, we waited for our server, who's first question was if we were ready to order. Not hello, not even his name. We place the order for a Margeritta pizza and the salsiccia. The Magueritta was oily, with few basil on top. The sauce tasted as if it were from a can. The Salsiccia was a different story, it was saucy, tangy from the tomatoes and a bit of smokiness from the sausage and the crust. Overall our favorite. What brought this to a 3 star would have to be the 5 flies hovering our table, the greasy table top and dirty wine list. Overall an average experience. Not worth the 20 minute drive."}
{"text":"Guys their lunch pizzas are only $10...and they're on postmates plus. 

They deserve 5 stars but I give 4, because when something is good I can't just have a lunch portion of it.

Anyways, go for the Di Notte as your white pizza, to contrast go for the Diavola or the Prosciutto Crudo. For dessert get the Nutella and Mascarpone."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I've been there only once to celebrate a friend's birthday and we arrived just on time for Happy Hour.
Their happy hour menu's pretty good. They offer the regular stuff, drinks and some appetizers but everything we tried was very good.

Cute place for dinner too. Their patio's decorated with lights so it has somehow a \"festive\" touch but it also makes a cute spot for a date. It's really loud, though and very crowded. We were seating outside but all the tables inside were taken too. If a place is that packed, it can't be bad, right? Give it a try. You'll understand why it has so many good reviews."}
{"text":"Let me add to the chorus of awesome.  This place sets the Neapolitan pizza standard in Phoenix (amidst quite a bit of competition).  Bianco, yeah yeah, it's good, if you've got the patience to wait and know well in advance that all the hype is more than just a wee overstated.  I've eaten at Cibo probably 50 times in the last 5 years and, without question, it is safe to say that it's better than Bianco.  Guido has established a standard of excellence and consistency with the pizzas that is beyond compare, really at any restaurant I've ever frequented.  And then you have ever-changing pastas and (in the winter) soups Tuesdays and Wednesdays?  Out of this world sandwiches, served only at lunch?  And have you HAD their breakfast?  It's all ridiculously excellent.  And stupid reasonably priced.  

If you're in any way freaked out by the neighborhood, it says a lot more about you than it does about the 'hood.  Stay in Chandler, there's a Chili's there waiting for you, with lots of ranch dressing.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food is bland. Side of chicken was cold, calamari clearly frozen. Disappointed and would not recommend sadly."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!!! I'm a huge fan of the truffle oil one! I wish we had ordered two of these instead of the margherita. Service was super fast and efficient for a busy Friday evening - I was impressed. I also loved the ambiance of the restaurant. We were seated outdoors by the entrance and it was surrounded by trees but it didn't feel too woodsy.

Always save room for dessert too. The banana nutella crepe was amazing!"}
{"text":"Really excited to try this place out before a show. Got here a little before 6 and our show starts at 8. Told a 20-30 min wait. Though it's hard to estimate wait time, you should be somewhat in the ballpark. Just left after waiting an hour to go to a neighboring taco joint and I just received notification that my table is ready after an hour and a half. They give estimated low wait times so you stay and after waiting for a while you figure you might as well stick it out just a bit longer. Shame on you guys"}
{"text":"This place knows how to rock my face off. Maybe I am just easy in giving them 5 stars, but they impressed when I didn't know what to expect. The brushetta is off the chain. I tried several different slices of pizza and not one disappointed. 

The only knock I can give is that, given that it is a small place, it does take a long time to get seated if there is a crowd. They do say patience is a virtue. Believe me this place is worth the wait. By far my favorite pizza place thus far. I am eagerly anticipating my next travel there. Not soon enough..."}
{"text":"I adore Cibo! Their pizzas, pastas, salads, and crepes are truly to die for. Fresh and handmade each night, authentic unique and perfectly balanced flavors. I've tried every pizza on the menu and it never gets old. And I love the Ostia salad, I try to recreate it at home, but it never beats Cibo. I've celebrated many special occasions end life events here, as well going for a regular day lunch or dinner when I'm wanting the most delicious Italian option that downtown Phoenix has to offer. If you've never been to this local jewel, you need to. Tonight."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about the great cuisines in Phoenix and decided to come to this popular Italian restaurant to get a first impression. Located in a house with a spacious front patio, the interior encompassed a full bar area, breakout dining rooms, hardwood floors, and red brick walls. A friendly staff, constant foot traffic, and opportunities for people watching added to the festive, home-like atmosphere. I came here for dinner with a group of five that included fellow Yelpers Fia R, and Kurdy S, and decided to order antipasti and two pizzas to share. 

For antipasti, we went with the server's recommendation and ordered the Burrata ($14). The platter came with fresh mozzarella, balsamic drizzles, razor thin prosciutto, and toasted bread. I was impressed by the mozzarella, as it was light, airy, flavorful, and easy to spread across the warm crusty bread. The gentle flavors between the balsamic and prosciutto went hand in hand, as they complemented the mozzarella and bread without hindering it. This is a must get for those visiting for the first time. 

Next, we shared the half Diavola and half Magherita Pizza ($13). The Diavola was pleasantly spicy, as the pizza was inspired by the centrality of spicy salame embedded in mozzarella and tomato sauce. I also enjoyed the Margherita, as the light tasting tomato sauce, mozzarella, and fresh basil were spot on delicious. One noteworthy limitation regarding their pizza was the soft crust. It had a nice flavor but the texture was also flimsy and unexpected. 

Finally, we shared a half Procida and half Tartufata Pizza ($14). The Procida came with mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, Asian pears, chopped arugula, goat cheese and black pepper. The goat cheese flavor was very sharp, so I didn't particularly enjoy it as much as the other finesse tasting pizzas. The Tartufata arrived with mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, white mushrooms and white truffle oil drizzles. I enjoyed the smoky flavor stemming from the pizza, but the combination of strong-flavored white truffle oil and cheese didn't go particularly well for me. 

3.5 stars. Overall, it was a delicious meal with plenty to rave about. I suggest interested diners to be aware of possible long waits, especially for those arriving later in the evening. Additionally, I also would not suggest this place to those who have a strong preference for thin, crispy crust pizzas. Their desserts were also limited to crepes, which we didn't care for on that particular evening. I must say, the place is great for dates, but the noise level can be pretty loud. Despite these limitations, our water was constantly refilled, and we were attended to frequently without much interruption. It was a great way to start a new journey in Phoenix. I hope to find the perfect crust in the area before coming back."}
{"text":"We were visiting friends for the weekend in Pheonix and wanted good food that wasn't too expensive. This place was one of the top places on yelp, and our friends swore by it, so it was a done deal that we were going. We got there just after 6, and were told the wait was going to be about 20 minutes. We waited patiently and finally got seated, though it probably took closer to 40 minutes.  We were seated outside, and the atmosphere was very romantic. There was a fire pit behind us, and trees all around. 

We ordered several pizzas and a bottle of wine. The pizzas were all very unique and flavorful. My favorite one was the Margherita, which had full size leaves of fresh basil on it. The crust was perfectly thin, and pizza was nice and light. One of the other ones we had contained proscuitto on it, and was also very good. It really reminded me of the true Italian pizza that my husband and I had sampled in Milan and Rome on our honeymoon.

Overall a great experience, I would recommend."}
{"text":"The good, the bad, and the ugly. The good: amazing venue. Warm, romantic, and live music. The bad: the food. In one word: Bland. The ugly: the service. The waitress was warm and friendly at first. Then she basically ignored us the rest of the meal. We had to, at one point, get our own iced tea refill. Overall, while the venue and atmosphere was great the food and service was underwhelming."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Cibo for a lovely birthday dinner the other night. He couldn't believe I had never been... now, neither can I! The food was absolutely amazing (gnocchi with spicy sausage), the wine list had many great options, and the atmosphere very low-key and casual. We were able to enjoy our food leisurely and without interruption. Matt, our waiter, was timely, humorous, and charming."}
{"text":"I didn't love this place.. the pizza tasted burnt. we went in a group of 6 ppl and ordered  different types of pizza, but they all were a bit burnt with the burnt taste. Although, I did not like their food the location of this restaurant was fantastic, and the ambiance was wonderful as well with friendly staff."}
{"text":"My kid and I have eaten here a dozen or so times for lunch. Consistently good and their $15 lunch board is a great deal and comes with a homemade treat to take home in a brown paper bag. 

They also have a great $5 cocktail special on certain days of the week. Also available is a kids menu."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in Phoenix. I've been to Pomo, Pizzeria Bianco, Andreoli, Parlor, you name it. Cibo just tastes... fresher? Might be something in the water (which is surprisingly not shitty compared to a lot of Phoenix venues, good job) but I just can't get enough of this place.

Atmosphere is nice, cozy and not pretentious. Wine selection is above average. Staff is generally personable and helpful (Meagan is the best though). Cleanliness is never an issue.  But the pizza, that's what we come for."}
{"text":"Very very good lunch spot!  Was a little disappointed when I found out they didn't have pizza on their lunch menu. But when I tasted the prosciutto \"sandwich\", I didn't mind anymore. It was a great meal with a relaxing & great ambiance!"}
{"text":"What a cute place. It's a wood fired pizza restaurant in the middle of a residential neighborhood, really random!

The pizza was very good, a lot better than the huge waits at Pizzeria Bianca.  I have never had their pizza so I can't compare, but this is really good pizza with no wait. Saturday at 5 pm, walked right in and got to sit outside.  I haven't seen the inside so I have no idea what it is like in there, but outside is really nice, the birds even walk right up to the table and then fly away.

They have \"root beer\" it's not root beer, it's sarsaparilla marked root beer, it was one of the best sarsaparilla's i've had though but I would not really have it again as I prefer real root beer.

The salsicca and genova pizzas were both great.  Salsicca was salami and cheese and the Genova was cheese and some dark greens.  Both were really good tasting and not burnt.

I also had the Cioccolino which is a thick chocolate liquer shot.  It was strong but pretty good, but super thick, almost too thick.

I must say it's hard to find normal pizzas here, which speaks to the authenticity, but be careful if you bring picky eaters."}
{"text":"Lovely little spot downtown.  Very nice services and adorable building.  Love the outdoor patio   While I so appreciate the fact that they have Gluten Free Pizza (so hard to find) the crust is so salty that it's almost not edible.  I've tried it twice to make sure it wasn't a one time mistake.  I WILL go back again but will opt for a salad next time."}
{"text":"Wow. I cannot wait to come back. This place is a true little gem of Phoenix. I went to a really amazing true Italian restaurant in SD awhile back and I was hoping to find one here in AZ . Well, I found it and all of my dreams came true. Please order the Burrata and let it melt in your mouth, please! You won't be disappointed. Also, that pizza dough is spot on."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, hospitable service. We were a party of 3 for lunch and had the chicken salad, the caprese salad and charcuterie platter. With a very nice bottle of wine. All very satisfying."}
{"text":"I came with a big group, and we were seated outside. The weather was nice, which was awesome. There were a lot of leaves being blown onto the table, but it's a worthy tradeoff for getting some shade.

The service was great; they were generally unintrusive, but were available to bring new water jugs and clear plates in a timely fashion. I also really loved the fact that our waitress announced loudly when she passed out the checks that the gratuity was already included. I would've expected that with a group as big as ours (14 people), but it was nice to have it be declared and not assumed.

I ordered the contadino with a side house salad. The cheese on the salad was 10/10, and it was light on the dressing, which I appreciated. The sandwich had amaaaaaazing flavors (man, do I love egg), but it was a bit heavier than I had expected, which made it impossible to finish."}
{"text":"First of all, I love the ambiance. Perfect for date night and also perfect for my birthday dinner. 

Service and food wise, not so much. Our server was pretty rude. My boyfriend told her it was my birthday, and she said, \"....ok. I'll bring something out at the end.\" She didn't not even look at me or say Happy Birthday. Okay whatever. We ordered the Palline 2.0, the fried dough with a side of Nutella, and a pizza that had potatoes and sausage on it. 

The fried dough: I expected it to be soft and fluffy...but it was a lot harder than I thought. It was hard to chew.

Pizza: Meh...It was good? But it didn't really have a taste to it. I can taste the potatoes a little, but the cheese flavor was very mellow, and so was the sausage surprisingly. I did, however, taste the burnt crust very well. 

Free Nutella crepe: At least I got this for free for my birthday...but the crepe isn't as good as other ones I've tried.

The entire time, our server didn't not ONCE look at me...WHY? My goodness...how upsetting. If I wasn't trying to have a nice birthday dinner, I would give it 1 or 2 stars."}
{"text":"For an artisan pizzeria, it's pretty good. 

Not so spectacular that I will insist that all my friends go there, but if someone suggests it, I certainly won't argue against their decision to take me there.

Also, their crepes. Delicious."}
{"text":"This place is so lovely and romantic. Its a must on our list every time we are in Phoenix. It's a small Italian restaurant in a renovated house and the place is always packed so be ready for a line. The pizza was a delight. Can't wait for this nights meal with my family."}
{"text":"Awesome Happy hour -- got the Polpette (meatballs) & they were AMAZING.. came with 3 large meatballs with some bread and lots of sauce for $6. Also, we got the gnocchi (Also $6), which I don't love gnocchi, & it was delicious.. the sauce on the two were different which made them even better in my opinion. The HH wine was only $4 and OK -- for that price, I'll drink whatever but wouldn't be too pleased if I paid full price for it.. but I'm sure its the house wine/chianti of some kind. My boyfriend and I then split the Capricciosa pizza, perfect size for us both (plus the 2 apps we shared). The pizza reminded me of something you would get in Italy & we both enjoyed it a lot. I would highly recommend it here, food is good, service is great, ambience is nice."}
{"text":"4/5 solid. not gonna add any more, since there are already so many rave reviews."}
{"text":"Such a cute date night spot! We went a few months back around 7 or 8pm on what had to have been a busy Sunday, they were out of a couple of things we tried to order, which is understandable for smaller restaurants. But it was great, the patio is amazing!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was super good! It was reasonably priced for a higher quality pizza! Cozy environment, nice location."}
{"text":"I am having a difficult time deciding how to even begin this review. In the simplest terms, Cibo has my heart. The outdoor seating is romantic and lovely, while indoors is equally cute and \"busy.\" The food is TO DIE FOR. If I was on death row, their food would constitute my last meal. Hands down, they have the best pizza I have ever had the pleasure to taste. Do not miss the opportunity to order the Burrata as an appetizer (and then again for dinner!) - the mozzarella is creamy, the prosciutto fresh, and the bread baked to perfection. We also had the prosciutto crudo pizza, which was every bit as delicious as the appetizer. Overall, one of the best restaurant experiences I have ever had. A big 5/5 from this foodie here."}
{"text":"The porcellono sandwich was great. Everyone loved their food. Indoor and outdoor areas. Highly recommend for lunch."}
{"text":"A cozy Italian restaurant with great character and good service. The meatball sandwich was delicious and the homenade bread they make for it is worth a try. Glad we found this little gem on our weekend trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I'm all about the atmosphere...the ambiance, and this quaint, cozy restaurant is sensational. There's a large patio area with a bonfire pit, live music and lots of twinkling lights. Mix that with exposed brick, stained glass and a fireplace. 
    
    We went around 8 and the place was packed, staff was running in and out and each plate that walked by looked better than the last. It took about 15 minutes to be seated but the patio was perfect. I got a glass of red wine and my friend and I split the antipasto speciale appetizer. With many small morsels like prosciutto, Caramelized onions,  mozzarella, and olives it was a nice starter platter. 

    We ordered a half and half pizza with the La Noce and the Capriciossa. The Noce had arugula and walnuts while the Capriciossa was covered in artichoke, prosciutto, mushrooms and black olives. We took our pizza to go because it did take a bit to come out, but over all it was an enjoyable, relaxed setting."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic pizza. One of the best in the area. Far better than Postinos. I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Tom, our waiter made the night... very knowledgeable and competent, always there yet never hovering. Almost like Magic.

First of all, though;

If you are on a gluten free diet and want pizza YOU HAVE TO GO HERE!

And now:

The staff was brilliant, up to and including making sure our water never ran out.

The atmosphere outside was festive without being overwhelming. The inside was cramped and too loud... but if you line the party atmosphere it's 199-% you.

The food was perfectly done and arrived at the table right on time. The beer was wonderful (I had an oatmeal around from a brewery in Tucson). At one point Ton thought he had served me the wrong beer, so he was going to buy me what I had ordered. I checked and it was what I had ordered... but he bought me another round anyway.

My girl ordered the calzone - which was huge, fillings in a perfect balance and perfectly done.

I ordered the Diavolo, I believe - gluten free.

If you are on a gluten free diet and want pizza YOU HAVE TO GO HERE! I would t have known it was GF. It was incredible. Damn near miraculous.

Not cheap, but worth every penny. 2 people with all the trimmings will hit you for a Benjamin... but when the prosciutto and tomatoes are imported from Italy you know it's an awesome value.

EASY 5 stars. Good job, Tom! :)"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's bday and had a great time. They plugged in the lights outside as it got dark and it was so lovely. We ordered a few different salads and 3 different pizzas, along with a breaded mozzarella/rice ball paired with marina sauce as an appetizer. Everything was delicious! The salads were huge and not overly expensive considering the size. Our server (who I think was the manager possibly) was very friendly and the service was relatively fast. They brought out a massive Nutella crepe for the bday girl and the entire table promptly consumed it. Overall, wonderful evening and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Was there a couple weeks ago.. They don't take reservations for parties under six but it was a Wednesday and not that busy. Food and atmosphere was great- though the birds outside were constantly landing on our table to sneak a bite."}
{"text":"This is a tough review to write, as I really want Regent Square to be blowing up with awesomeness.  Everything about this place is generally pretty awesome.  Nice, comfortable atmosphere, good waitstaff, well lit...except the food was really bad.

It's almost like they were doing a performance piece showing the dangers of excess.  My Cibo pasta was so rich, that my brow is furrowing reflexively in memory of the unbelievable amount of oil that went into it.  We also got a dish that was so salty, that I sincerely think there was some kind of crazy accident in the kitchen.

Oh, and there's an insane 7 dollar 'uncorking fee' per bottle of wine.  Unless you are uncorking my wine bottle with a fucking machete, or in some other elaborate circus manner, that dog just will not hunt, Monsignor.

The prices are a little high to give this place too many chances as well.  I really hope that this place will be able to pull itself together, because in this town you either need to be good, or cheap, but preferably both."}
{"text":"I have been to Cibo a few times now and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good date spot, and ambiance.  It is located in downtown phoenix and the restaurant is a beautiful old house with a great patio.  My girlfriend and I got lucky and enjoyed live entertainment.

The food is amazing.  I had the pizza and the burrata mozzarella.  Both were perfect.  The mozzarella was so soft and came with prosciutto and bread and was drizzled with balsamic vinegar.  

I love the crust on the pizza... completely crucial.  

Check it out."}
{"text":"Cibo is awesome!  Housed in an old downtown Phoenix home, it has charm and class...good as both a date night hot spot and a casual lunch stop, anybody fits in.  Also has a small bar and outdoor seating (with heaters for the winter).  The pizza, salads and dessert are all fantastic, they have a pretty good beer selection and the wait at dinner is never more than about an hour. I guess my only complaints would be the parking...just like anywhere else downtown it's limited; and it can get a bit loud inside when it's busy. 

Thinking about taking your date/out of town guests to Biancos?  Don't bother...head over to Cibos for better food, better atmosphere, and a shorter wait."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here. Their portions aren't huge but it's still serious
 I love their crepes for dessert. Service is wonderful. I love the lights and live music."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and great place to eat outside when weather is good. Very cool downtown location and great food. The crepes and pizza are awesome. Good service and pricing is affordable."}
{"text":"Two words: WORTH IT.

Unlike some other wood fire joints in town, this one lives up to the hype.

Every pie Ive had there has been delicious. Great, fresh ingredients, good sauces.

We always bring people from out of town here and they love it.

Good local beer and wine selection. Kitchy, cozy atmosphere. 

Oh and did I mention the dessert crepes? Wonderful. Any of them it doesnt matter: chocolate, strawberries, bananas, Nutella...... seriously theyre amazing.

*We* always seem to beat the rush, but its worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've heard so many great things about this place; so glad I finally got to try it myself! We were looking for Italian food in downtown Phoenix last night and this place popped into my mind almost instantly. We went around 5:30 and only waited a couple of minutes for a table. My boyfriend had the Oak Creek Hefeweizen (one of our favorites) and I had a Pinot Grigio, which was the perfect choice for the warm summer night. I started with the house salad, which was delicious and fresh. Then, we got a pizza and a pasta to split. I had the pasta del giorno (whichever the pasta of the day was for Saturday) and we also got the La Noce pizza, which my boyfriend raved about (and wouldn't let me try because he enjoyed it himself so much!). Overall, it was a very enjoyable dining experience. The food was delicious and the servers were very friendly and helpful! We'll definitely be returning and I'll be joining my friends in recommending it."}
{"text":"The pizza here is very, very good.  Not quite the caliber of Pizzeria Bianco or Pomo, but it's very close.  Better than that though is the venue, it is in a very interesting old house, with one of the best outdoor patios you can find in downtown phoenix."}
{"text":"Yum Yum!  Been here twice now, and it was fab both times.  I recommend the Calzone, anything with their prosciutto, and Crepes Suzette."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at this place.  And it is so quaint and wonderful.  I go probably for the atmosphere more than for the food (although the food is wonderful as well).  My one thing would be that because I try to steer clear of pork, maybe more chicken or fish plate options might be nice?"}
{"text":"This place might have one of the best happy hours around, hands down! $2.50 peronis! Thank you!  I order a lot of food assuming the entrees would be small for the cost, I ended up with 3 to go boxes. 

Service was sub par. My father and I were greeted and promptly sat but it went down hill after that. Staff hit all 3 tables around us before we were able to meet our new server. Maybe it was the shift change. Luckily the happy hour menu was so good that I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Nice food, nice service!
Best Italian pasta I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"Post Gazette announced today (2-3-17) Cibo will be closing.  No, they will be relocating. Keep an eye out.  Wonderful meal. Excellent, unpretentious service. There were 4 of us and we decided to go with a lot of small plates. Cibo gives you the option of small plates or large on most of their pasta dishes.  Had the elk carpaccio and duck confit.  Elk was lean, not gamey with EVOO and fennel pollen. (Where can I get a bag of this stuff?)  Duck was a very large drumstick, yieding 4 large (for an app) portions. Next came homemade farfalle with mushrooms - so good. Eggplant parm-not your pixburgh eggplant parm. The eggplant still had some body to it and their was just a dash of cinnamon in the sauce, giving it a North African vibe.  Wine braised beef must have been braised for a day at least; excellent.  Had the gnudi. Get them, trust me.  Cibo is BYOB, which I like. They charge $5 a bottle, have appropriate stemware AND they gave us a decanter for the 1994 montepulciano.  Decor simple; they have local artists displayed on the walls. Volume level is OK. Restaurant is all one level so it appears wheelchair accessible.  Bathroom is unisex.  This is the kind of restaurant that makes Pittsburgh such a great food scene.  Go before they close and look forward to their reopening."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious. Saw the reviews and knew I had to try it. I enjoyed that they served two different types of pizza, one with and one without the red sauce. I was really looking forward to trying the pasta but unfortunately nothing sounded appetizing that night. I also wish they served truffle fries as an appetizer as that really would've hit the spot and left room to order something other than the sandwiches it's paired with. Otherwise, we had a delightful time and enjoyed both the drink selections as well as the overall ambience. The portions are more than enough for one person and was full of flavors. I would recommend you give this place a shot."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Cibo about a dozen times over the past 8 years. It's a beautiful restaurant, just tucked away from the Downtown/Roosevelt hustle & bustle - and the food is fantastic! The pizza here is crisp and delicious, and I really enjoy their sandwich creations! They use very high quality meat (and yes, I'm a mostly vegetarian!), and the ciabatta bread is to die for! 

This place is great if you are looking to spend all night drinking wine and eating great food with friends, if you are celebrating something special, or if you just want a tasty lunch! Parking is fairly straightforward here. And also, big kudos to the staff who have always been very friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"TIP: this places takes no reservations on fridays and limited reservations on saturdays so expect long wait times standing in front of the house.  when you get in, skip the mediocre salads and just order the amazingly fresh pizzas.  ask to sit inside cuz outside can get crazy hot even at nights.

This joint is just unusual because it's in a house that serves pizzas and salads (i'm surprised neighbors don't complain).  expect long waits in the weekends.  Service could be better cuz the dude thought i ordered a nut brown when i asked for a dirty blonde and a calzone when i asked for a magherita pizza.  The pizza is as fresh as it gets.  You can tell the ingredients are fresh because the tomato sauce in the pizza is extra tangy.   The local beer from sedona (nut brown) and tempe (pale ale) are extremely flavorful.  The pesto salad is not that great (can't taste the pesto, should have tossed it)."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came in around 5pm for happy hour on Monday. What a great experience. We ordered a House salad, meatball app and Gnocchi app. Everything was fantastic!  Peroni beers are $2.50 and ice cold. Great service, great food, great ambiance. We each had two beers each and an abundance of great food for $31.00. This place is a little gem."}
{"text":"Set in a historic home with what can only be described as an enchanted patio, Cibo is a romantic and rustic departure from the ordinary. It is the perfect place for a dinner date with that special someone or to reunite with friends to share an amazing meal. My favorite pizza is the Tartufata - prosciutto, mushrooms, truffle oil, simply wonderful. Stop by for a unique and exquisite dining experience."}
{"text":"Great meal! Burratta was outstanding. I had a half and half pizza and my girl had a calazone that was so on point. We look forward until we return again."}
{"text":"What do you want me to update.... my rating is still 5 stars +++ and love love this place. Pizzas were amazing and the wines were perfect. Appetizers we had calamari and a meat and cheese board and everyone was welcoming, professional and took good care of us. Thanks again for a great evening and definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Lay me down on a bed of Burrata and send me out to sea... I'll die an overly-stuffed and happy man. Add in the best tasting pizza sauce I've ever had, cute and romantic outdoor seating, and a bustling interior bursting with life and you've got a solid recipe for a wonderful four star pizza joint. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Good attentive service but food is overpriced and underwhelming.  Rare that I go to any restaurant and find I don't want to eat anything I've ordered.

Yes, it was that bad!  It's a disgrace.

Maybe if I ate pizza and tiramisu, I would not have been disappointed. 

However beef steak was overseasoned, poor quality and tepid. The garlic aoili was over garlicky and greasy.  It seemed that even the basics were wrecked by poor choice of ingredients (golden sultanas in everything it seemed) and/or poor execution.

I don't mind buying a pricey meal if the food warrants it but this place is terrible.

Frankly, if I'd got together a bunch of my relatives, none of whom have catering experience, I think we could have done a much better job.

In a nutshell: stay away!"}
{"text":"Really great food and atmosphere.  Valet parking is easy and convenient. Great wine list. One of my favorite places to go! Update for December 2014 - dinner was great, place was packed. Six of us dining and requested two bills. A tip was added onto both bills, but it was not easy to see that it was added...two of us looked for it before adding a tip and neither of us saw that it was added. Of course the server did NOT have the courtesy to tell us. We added 20% and she still didn't say a thing, resulting in an almost 40% tip!! I tip very well if the service is good, but I'm very disappointed that a server wouldn't point out that it is included in the bill already. We had to find her and request a partial refund of our double tip, which was embarrassing. She knew exactly what she was doing. Management be aware of your employees pulling this on customers."}
{"text":"The service was great. He was very attentive and always nearby when needed. I am hoping that the kitchen was just having an off night. We ordered the bruschetta appetizer and the toppings were great, but the bread was burnt. We ordered two different pizzas, one red, and one white. The red was the vegetariano. It was quite salty and the crust was very burnt on one half of the pie. The white pizza's name escapes me, but it is the one with a truffle oil drizzle. This pizza was extremely salty! The crust was in better shape, but still on the well done side.

I like the location, the atmosphere is great, and the service was also good. Because of the salty pizza and consistently burnt bread, I'm not sure that I will return. Again, I hope it was just a kitchen error, but I dont think I will take that chance."}
{"text":"Perfect place to drunkenly grab a pizza during first fridays! So good! And definitely better than bianco because there isn't an insane wait with snobby hostesses! Go cibo!"}
{"text":"If you're ever looking to do something special, rent out the clubhouse.  My oh my it was the nicest venue for an intimate party that I'd ever been to.  Absolutely picturesque and charming to boot.  It was like being in a sophisticated grown up fairy cottage.  Plus it's no secret that the food is delectable."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had dinner at Cibo before a show.  They were unexpectedly slammed.  Our waitress Christina was really fabulous.  Calm and gracious. The food was, as always, wonderful.  Wish it was closer to my house in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Ok here goes.  I'll start with the bad and finish positive.  As far as Pizza goes, which is what we went for, I was not that impressed.  I must say I'm more of a NY style, by the slice pizza kind of guy.  So the pizza did not hit the spot.  Maybe a little too fancy for my palette. (You can take a boy out of the ghetto, but you can't take the ghetto out of the boy, so for me simple food is always better.)  Obviously, there are enough people who like gourmet pizza as this place has amazing reviews, so I'm just one simple man.

The obnoxious fat chick sitting right behind me proclaimed to her friend, \"I'm no longer investing time in men who aren't available!\"  Put down the pizza and grab a dry salad and shut up!!  That's not really the restaurants fault though but I did have to endure that convo through the duration of my meal.

Our server was very nice however seemed very rushed and at times we had to wait for refills on water and for the check.  The atmosphere is very romantic outside with light trees and live music.  They even turned on one of the heaters on the patio for the lil lady.  We has the Crepe with Nutella chocolate powdered sugar and ice cream and it was very very good.  

Bottom line.  I'd be willing to come here again and try something other than pizza."}
{"text":"Cibo is a great place to go when you are in the mood for pizza with a bit of a gourmet twist.  I have yet to try one that I did not like.  Their salads are really good as well.  And, I enjoy the quaint atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is perfect.. the food, the ambiance. My boyfriend loves the lasagna which they only make on occasion. I had sent a message via Facebook asking if they could make it again for an upcoming date night as a surprise. They accommodated! Not many places will do something like that. We are regulars and I suggest this place to anyone! I don't eat meat and I recommend the Geneva Pizza it's amazing. And my boyfriend would definitely recommend the lasagna. Best place in Phoenix. I've been coming here for years and will continue for years to come."}
{"text":"I think Cibo's puts Pizzeria Bianco to shame! The wait time is half the time AND you can check in on yelp, WINNING! I love this place the pizza is fresh and delicious, I love this place. The atmosphere is great, it can be a nice romantic evening and when the weather is nice the patio is gorgeous... if you can get a seat."}
{"text":"Moderately-priced food with a beautiful outdoor brick-and-garden patio and simple dishes made with good quality, fresh ingredients. I had a proscuitto and mozzarella sandwich on some incredible homemade bread, similar to a ciabatta, of sorts. not really. Whatever - the point is, it's fresh and tastes amazing!
One downside - the lunch menu is pretty limited with just sandwiches and salads."}
{"text":"This was first time to Cibo, the place and vibe is really good. As for the food I think I should have tried their pizza first. I had their pasta and it was alright. I think it's a little over priced. My boyfriend had a veggie pizza with one veggie on each slice. It tasted great but there should of been more toppings spread out."}
{"text":"First time here was last Friday! We had a group of 10 friends and were sat quickly. Our server neglected us, and focused on the party of 14+ sitting next to us. Over 40 minutes to put our order in. 

But the food was delicious! Unique pizza combinations, I got the sienna. A white pizza with zucchini and prosciutto. Flavors were perfectly combined and the crust was thin but not floppy. Took another 20 minutes to close out the check...

Patio was beautiful though!"}
{"text":"In the heart of downtown lies a quaint little place called Cibo. I visited this place on a Friday during lunchtime and sat outside because the weather was beautiful. Nestled in an old house off of 5th ave, this place has a lot of character. Wrought iron tables and chairs on a brick patio surrounded by green shrubs and birds a chirpin, it's got a relaxed type of vibe. Our server was cool, and did a good job of being attentive and getting out food out to us. We ordered the PLT and Salsiccia both with side house salads. The food came out a little under 10 min after we ordered! We were very impressed by that. The portion sizes were great, and I almost couldn't finish all of mine. I had always heard good things about this place and was not disappointed. Will def be back to try the pizza and wine."}
{"text":"And now to add to my list of pizza places, Cibo.

Here is how I rank the pizza of Arizona, and I've tasted a LOT of it.

1. Pizzeria Bianco 
2. Patsy Grimaldi's
3. Cibo
4. Pomo
5. Humble Pie

. We ended up at Cibo because we were craving Grimaldi's (didn't have a car to get to the location in Old Town), we didn't feel like waiting for Pizzeria Bianco, and the light rail had a convenient stop around .4 miles away from Cibo. Easy walk over.  

Cibo can best be likened to Pizzeria Bianco or Pomo in taste. The owners, both very kind people, were working as the hosts the night we came in. It was around a 45 minute wait at 8:00 on a Thursday, so I just talked with my two good friends while we waited. No big deal. The restaurant had a homely feel to it, as it is a renovated old house and it was family-ran. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant had an older feel to it. More of a place for 25 year olds instead of a bunch of college students, but whatever. I'd highly recommend the outside tables for a date, it has a \"romantic\" feel to it. It is also a good place for large parties, although I think Grimaldi's is a bit more convenient. 

Now, the food.

The bread. Wow. Great bread, only beat by Chris Bianco's bread or the Andreoli's bread. I loved it, definitely worth the $2! Had a great crunch to it and was very tasty. Europeans definitely put more emphasis on their bread than Americans!

The pizza came in a pretty timely manner considering how busy it was that night. I ordered my standard, Margarita with Spicy Salami (aka, pepperoni). No normal pepperoni here. :( They had a lot of other options as well, such as Salmon for your pizza and more! The pizza was excellent. The crust was great and all around it was delightful! 

We didn't order Crepes, Salad, or Bruschetta, but I definitely want to try the Bruschetta and Crepes next time I go there. Both looked great! The restauraunt seemed to have a lot of good options for wine as well!

All around, an awesome place to be. We'll be back once school kicks up again.

P.S: Keep in mind their hours! They are closed Sundays."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is hip and quaint at the same time.  We enjoyed the pizza here.  Service was good.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 4 people and we all agreed it was the best pizza in PHX/Scottsdale.  Diavola, Tartufata and Quattro Formaggi were flat out unreal."}
{"text":"The reason I am giving this restaurant even a 1 star is only because of the food, not that it was over the top, but because it was decent plus. The service/no service would have been good if only our waitress Monique would even understand the meaning of the word. 
There were 4 of us, and we all..figured that she was very aloof and full of her self right from the start.She offered nothing.
\"More coffee\"? Etc... we even had to  get our own plates for sharing. Did not offer dessert, and when I ordered tea, I got the bill instead.. shame on a restaurant that keeps servers like her."}
{"text":"This place is great!! Went here on a whim cause it was open pretty late on a Saturday. The pizza is so good I ate the whole thing to myself. The only bad thing is I was to full to order any of the crepes! They looked delicious as well."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the atmosphere up in here is great!  The front dining yard is lit up at night by peaceful white lights strewn in organized chaos from the trees that grace the grounds.  This is the perfect patio for a relaxing meal spent  enjoying the company of good friends or for a casual date.

As far as food goes....YUM, delicious, please sir...may I have some more?  I can't say enough about the pizza...the crust is perfect in texture and taste and the ingredients that top the pizza (including the ooey gooey cheese) are of the highest quality.  I highly recommend this traint (trendy AND quaint) Phoenix eatery.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"1st time here for dinner! Definitely will be back ! We had a couple of appetizers,pizza wine a desert ! Everything was on point along with the customer service! The music  in the evening was wonderful! Loved the ambiance and feel  of this restaurant!  The perfect Gem tucked away !"}
{"text":"Oh Cibo how I love thee! Let me count the ways

You have the most adorable setting i've ever laid eyes on

The Salads are so fresh and sized to share

The pizza's are OUT.OF.THIS.WORLD! 

And let's not forget dessert. I look forward to the Fresca crepe with each visit I make.

I heart you Cibo."}
{"text":"Amazing specialty pizzas, great ambiance. The outdoor patio is gorgeous. The prosciutto pizza is to die for."}
{"text":"Cozy place to dine. Plenty of outside seating. We had the Meatball Appetizer ( sauce was great ). And the spicy salami pizza and Salad but the star dish of the night was definitely the Crepe desert filled with fruits and Marscapone cheese.  Dynamite."}
{"text":"I love this place, their pizza and salads are really good. The nutella crep is the way to go for dessert."}
{"text":"When Oprah came to Phoenix, I think she misquoted the Best Pizza in America. Cibo is definitely the best Pizza in Phoenix. Once you eat the Tartufata is one of the best. How can you beat a white pizza with truffle oil? I think that this is where other Pizza Joint owner eat too."}
{"text":"Big fan! I was in Phoenix for work and yelped out best pizza in Phoenix and this place came up. I ordered a Margherita pizza with cherry tomatoes on top and it was fantastic.  The Nutella was awesome too!"}
{"text":"Nobody likes a downer but all I can do is relay my experience. Every restaurant has an off night but this was pretty disappointing. I've been wanting to eat here for a couple years and we made the trip from the east side all the way to downtown. Sat down and were immediately greeted and I ordered a beer. The server walked away and came back about 5 mins later and asked us if we were ready to order sans beer. As soon as he asked us if we were ready to order you could see that he realized he forgot the beer. No big deal. I work in a restaurant and am very patient as I understand that sometimes shit happens. We order a bottle of wine and a salad and 2 pizzas. He says he'll be back with the beer and the wine and we are totally patient at this point. After about 15 minutes we are still sitting there waiting for our drinks. I can see the bar from where I'm sitting and there is no beer or wine in the service well so it's not like he is too busy to grab it he just never rang any of it in. At this point we look at each other and on cue both stand up and walk out. Ive never done this before but everybody around us honestly looked at us like they wished that they had done the same so their experiences couldn't have been any better. I'm not gonna bash this place and say that it's horrible but I'm just relaying my experience and I won't be back. Personally I'll wait the 3 hours at Bianco where I've never had a bad experience.."}
{"text":"I finally went to the famed Cibo. Really lovely place. 

I had the margherita pizza with some sausage added. Solid taste. You can always tell a pizza place by this staple. 

The pizza sauce isn't overwhelming and doesn't get in the way of the pizza.  It's like sitting around late at night reminiscing with an old friend. My only gripe is that the crust gets a wee bit soggy. I don't like the soggies."}
{"text":"We had a party of 10 and sat on the patio next to another big party.  When we arrived we agreed to sit on the patio because the misters were on so it was nice.  Half way through the meal they turned off the misters and it became very hot.  We brought it up and were told it leaked by another table so they were staying off.  So instead of moving one table they sacrificed the comfort of 2 large parties.  

The pizza was good, unfortunately service ruined the experience."}
{"text":"Amazing meatball sandwich, real lemonaide, good service. Only complaint - it was VERY noisy inside.  If you sit outside on a nice day then you can give it 5 starts for sure."}
{"text":"Great food. 

Came here after work at around 5:30 since we didn't want to wait for too long.

We ordered the following:
- burrata 
- Salsiccia pizza 
- procida pizza 

Burrata was great! The mozzarella cheese was so delicious and paired perfectly with the prosciutto. However, as a personal preference, I probably would've preferred the waitress had told us that 1 order of burrata is enough for a meal.. for 2 people. 

When the two pizzas were served, my colleague and I were too full.  We managed to each eat one slice of the pizzas.. then I just picked out the toppings for the procida pizza.  Well, I guess that says how good that combination is. 

Definitely coming back next time, but
1) with a bigger group or 
2) order less food"}
{"text":"ATTENTION GLUTEN FREE DIETERS!!!   My wife and I enjoyed the absolute best gluten free pizza I have ever had.  I am not gluten intolerant, my wife is.  We normally get gluten free pizzas that have a thin cracker-like crust that is at best \"OK\" in my opinion.  I am a bread lover and I really appreciate a great brick oven fired pizza with a big crispy crust.  In my limited experience, all of the gluten free crusts don't even have this.  This is the exception everybody!!  This tasted just as good if not better than most pizzas that I have had.  We had a rendition of their vegetarian pizza with added olives and oh man, it was SO good.  The waitress told us that the gluten free flour was imported from Italy and the owner of Cibo (as I understood it) went the great lengths to ensure that the crust was just right before releasing it.  

Again, I was a huge fan of this.  Finding good gluten free food can be tough for those who have an intolerance.  This is the absolute best gluten free pizza ever!!!  Well done Cibo!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix and this place kept popping up on Yelp so it seemed like I just had to go! As I was walking here from my hotel (16 minutes away) I thought I had gotten lost because it just somehow turned into a neighborhood. Very cute place and tucked away; I guess it used to be a house!

I got the Lunch Di Notte Pizza and it was delicious. Buttery cheese, salty, and sweet. If you drizzle it with some olive oil it's perfection! The crust is charred wonderfully and there's just something about this place that makes you happy every time you take a bite. Great flavors. Simple and not overpowering.

You don't need to order anything else for lunch, it was the perfect portion to make me feel satisfied. 

The bartender served me cause I sat alone at the bar and she provided great service. The hostess was nice too but a Welcome or a Good Bye would've been nice (yes, I notice those things -1 Star).

I would be more than happy to return if I ever ended up in Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you can't stand to wait to get a table at Pizzeria Bianco.  This is the place to go if you looooove olives the size of you head.  The pizza is great (I prefer the fungi without the sauce), as is their version of caprese (which includes pesto and several sizes of tomato).  The cheese plate with the honey is also so so great!  Wine selection if also very good."}
{"text":"So here is a deal on a nudge of @AnthonyP (oh this is not twitter?) I decided to review a 4th place on Yelp since I have been a member as of late 2008.   I believe I went here w my sister like the first year they were open or was it just me not remembering any details I have no idea.  Anyway we got here first time pretty early or it was holiday so they weren't open yet or something like that years ago. Then we came back and everything was pretty much taken and it was so busy. I loved the decor and the feel of the place that puts you into a storybook or some other space and time.  I also thought I would see a ghost of some kind, but it all went well ( this is not Hollywood either).  So I reserve this place especially in my heart for its old wooden floors and the decor and lots and lots of flowers.  Hmmm that is what I remember anyways, half the stuff is prob made up. #reviewno4"}
{"text":"We ate dinner here and loved this place! We had planned on just getting dessert and eating dinner in, but we couldn't resist the unique and reasonably priced pizza options! You can get any of the pizza combinations half and half to make a full pizza, even red and white sauce combos. That's what we did and both halves were excellent! We ended with our dessert, which was a crepe with mascarpone cream and berries and the best dessert we've had in a long time. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"FABULOUS foods, fun atmosphere, expect a bit of a wait.  But it's worth it!"}
{"text":"From what I hear this place is set in a restored house from 1913.  Solid pizza and the deli anitpasto was great.  What really stands out is the atmosphere.  It's near the Roosevelt district and it's a very chill place."}
{"text":"The best crepe in town!!!

Even though the sign on the DOOR does not make sense but I still gave 5 stars.

The sign told us to get to the DOOR to get the table. We were in front of the door and noone help us. Until we figured out that we had to actually go through the DOOR to get inside to get the table."}
{"text":"The outdoor patio is adorable and small. I enjoyed the outdoor area even though our table kept wobbling.  My lemonade was fresh and that is all I can say about that.  I ordered the Capricciosa Pizza and was disappointed.  The crust was thin and when I was about to take my first bite half of the ingredients slid off my slice.  The crust had burnt pieces and for some it is their favorite part of an oven brick pizza, but it was an overwhelming burnt taste in every bite.  I loved the feel and location, but will only return for drinks in the patio during the fall/spring times.  Oh and the staff was great.  Very friendly, thought there was one too many for a small establishment and yet the women's restroom was unattended and clogged with lots of tissue."}
{"text":"Although I've only been a few times, as I'm only an annual visitor to Pittsburgh, I instantly fell in love with Cibo. The ONLY concerning thing is lack of space but it adds to the atmosphere. The BYOB feature is quite nice and the waitstaff is off the charts. We even got a table visit from the head chef! I can't recommend this place enough. In case Cibo staff is reading this, Jack G. brought me here."}
{"text":"Awesome food and an unbeatable atmosphere.  We the weather is nice, the patio is the place to be. All downtown insiders know about this place."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in the food here. Was here a couple of years ago and it was much better. Pizza recommended was not great. We over ordered, but it was not brought to our attention. I've had better pizza. Will probably not be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! Excellent pizza, salads, drinks and service! Truly a staple in Phoenix Az!"}
{"text":"Pizza could not be better!!! Even though we had to squeeze into the two back corner seats at the bar, I fell in love with this place with my first bite of the bruschetta. The bread was so amazingly soft with the crispy edge, no roof of my mouth scratches. I really wanted to ask for a loaf to go. Luckily the couple next to us got their pizza before we ordered because we almost ordered two. 

I've only been here once. This was our starting point before checking out a show at the previously named Dodge Theater. Tried some potato, arugula, and sausage pizza. It was incredible. The crust had just enough fire burn crustiness to it. The ingredients were super fresh, I wanted more more more, although, my tummy said STOP the maddness silly girl! 

Can't wait to go again, it got pretty busy, i think we got there just in time cause there isn't a whole lot of seating, and seems to be pretty happening. Actually, my BF was at a trade show in Worcester, MA, one of the guys in a booth next to him, said \"Wait, you're from AZ?...Have you tried Cibo? I go there every time I'm in the valley!\" We had to try it, thank you."}
{"text":"Delicious with amazing service! The atmosphere is beautiful and romantic! Lights strung everywhere through the trees! The waiter was knowledgeable about wines and the whole menu"}
{"text":"I'd say this restaurant has it all: food, service and ambiance.  We stopped by here on the way to the airport...only about a 10 minute drive to the car rental drop-off.

We were looking for a comfortable place that would work for three generations: 2 boys, my wife and I, and the grandparents.  This place met the mark: we all really enjoyed the experience.  It was unseasonably cold, so we ate inside--if the weather is warm, I'd recommend eating outside under the lights.  There were plenty of people outside braving the 50 degree weather, as there are heat lamps there.  We were told the house that holds the restaurant is 100 years old!

We had three pizzas: Rustica, Vegetarina, and the Funghi.  Our six year old had the individual margarita pizza.  We also had two of the house garden salads; a large is good for two people.  Started with the risotto balls and the meatballs.  Everything was excellent, although the risotto balls were a bit bland.  Pizza crust was perfect--crunchy on the outside with a bit of char from the wood fired oven.

Like othe reviewers, we loved the Nutella and banana crepe with ice cream.  We had two scoops, and it was plenty to share among six of us...very rich.  

Our waiter was really attentive, and the hostesses were nice.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Just ate here last night and had a great experience! (11.13.2015) The food was exceptional, service was great with great recommendations and the atmosphere was really nice.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice for dinner and ordered the same salad, but different pizzas. The Pesto Salad - grape tomatoes, pine nuts, roasted potatoes and parmigiano with pesto dressing. So, so, so good. The Vegetariana pizza - mushrooms, artichokes, zucchini, and red peppers in quadrants. It's like 4 different pizzas in one. The second pizza had prosciutto on it, but I can't remember the exact name. It was, as expected, delicious. I wish we could go here more often, but being downtown it's farther from us than we'd like. Overall, the food and price are comparable to our other favorite places to grab pizza. I noticed that they do brunch and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The setting is beautiful. They have a live guitarist .. it's nice to stop by when the weather is nice due to the decor if you decide to eat outside . They also offer indoor eating as well but it's a little crowded. Service was good / the food could have tasted a wee bit better . Overall it was a nice experience! I recommend it"}
{"text":"The white pizza was outstanding.  The crust was perfect.  We also had the pulled pork sandwich which was great as well.  We actually went for the pasta but found out it is not served until after 5pm.  Great outdoor and indoor seating.  The weather was perfect as well as the service."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Cibo, it's excellent Italian food with a great price. Every time we go, it just gets better and better."}
{"text":"The service is outstanding. I went their on my birthday and got there Nutella crepe for free, which by the way was warm, mouth watering and delicious. Excellent micro brew beer choices. But the wood fire pizza is outstanding. Tons of different pizza options with amazing fresh ingredients. Definitely a downtown Phoenix restaurant to check out on the weekend."}
{"text":"great pizza, very handcrafted and delicious.  The atmosphere is fun and very relaxed."}
{"text":"good pizza in a cute bungalow with a lovely outdoor garden seating!"}
{"text":"This was the right decision when it comes to brick oven pizza in Arizona. The wait was only 30 minutes and the pizza was so much better than the well known and televised local competition (let's just call them pizza B). The ambiance was fantastic and it was the perfect date spot for the wife and I to sit back and relax. They even had a local musician playing live music to even better the mood for dinner. Service was fantastic and every part of our dinner made the wife and I happy about our dinner choice.

Let me start by saying everything I ordered was perfect.

The ostra salad was plenty as a starter for the wife and I and it was fresh with fantastic tasting ingredients.
The diavola spicy pizza with ricotta added was the best pizza I have ever had.
My wife's white pizza was fantastic as well it had mushrooms greens and pork I believe on it
The banana creepes with Nutella and ice cream was oh so yummy.
The fresh made iced tea was also unique and fantastic.

We left with a 3 course meal for around $60 which is not bad at all for the experience and food we received

I would most defiantly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Awesome place ... family owned ... in a historic house ... outdoor dinning ... and best pizza I've had in Phoenix ... it's the shiz ya' all!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix!  The ambiance and decor is amazing.  There is a lovely patio with large trees and lights all around.  It is very intimate and romantic.  The pizza is scrumptious.  My favorites are the Di Notte and Rustica with red sauce.  I would eat here every night if I wasn't worried about my girlish figure!

Last night, Paul and I tried the crepes with nutella and bananas with ice cream.  I don't normally eat a lot of desserts, but I polished this one off!  Sorry Paul! 

You can't go wrong with this place!!"}
{"text":"Okay. I'm sure in 2005, Cibo was probably a ground-breaking culinary concept for Downtown Phoenix. But in 2018? Eh. Okay, I guess it still has its charms to a certain degree, especially if you're new to the area.

Although the ultra-trendy bungalow setup has now become somewhat of a hipster clich√© in Central Phoenix, Cibo was there long before the downtown scene started picking up. Locals seem to flock here for their pizza and wine fixes. Based on the conversations I've overheard while eating, it's clear that Cibo not only serves as an ideal first-date place, but a somewhat secretive hideaway for middle-aged couples having mid-life marital affairs (I've witnessed both first-hand at nearby tables).

Unfortunately, if you strip the ambiance out of Cibo and just look at their food for what it is, I've found it to just be only slightly above average. Their pizza is your standard-fare wood-fired style that can range from \"good\" to \"just okay\" depending on the day. On the positive, I do like that Cibo has no problem with letting you order half-half pies. Most places will arrogantly scoff at the mere mention of the idea. In fact, they even let you combine a white pizza with a red one, which is very rare, but incredibly convenient given all of their different choices.

While I give Cibo credit for offering some interesting creations, is it really necessary to have 22 different pizzas (sans the calzones) on the menu? Oddly enough, despite all of these ridiculous options that give me anxiety at first glance, their best pizza is a traditional margherita. Their calzone, which is rather alarming at first due to its massive size, is also fine, but nothing that can't easily be obtained elsewhere.

I've found a lot of inconsistencies with Cibo's pasta to the point where I'll only order it if I'm up for taking a risk. After my girlfriend and I recently ordered a taglietelle that ended up being undercooked, I was reminded of why I can't bring myself to give Cibo anymore than three stars.

For desserts, their crepes are one of the few things that I feel they've got down to a science. You really can't go wrong with a Nutella-banana crepe with a scoop of ice cream thrown in.

Their canned sodas seem like kind of an odd choice, especially considering most pizzerias opt for the glass bottle selection. It seems rather ghetto in comparison to everything else on the menu. Not everyone drinks wine, you know? 

I feel that Cibo is worth an occasional visit, especially if you're new to the city and not really familiar with the Phoenix restaurant scene. But in present-day, us dining veterans have become so spoiled with quality pizzerias and pasta joints that I feel Cibo is just kind of running on auto-pilot."}
{"text":"I'm not certain how many times I've reviewed Cibo, but every time we go there, I feel like the experience is 5-Star review worthy for a different reason. 
Tonight: The Saffron Scallop Papadelle. Is it possible to concoct a more deliciously simple yet exquisite dish? This dish was off the hook amazing. I would eat it every day. 
Never had it? 
Get your ass down here and get it before Chef moves on. 
Second great thing about tonight: The live music. Two dudes playing some extra entertaining interpretive classics. A keyboard & guitar is all. Brick House & Use Me, both classics and skillfully adapted by these guys. Anyone know who they are or where else they play? I mean these guys were Rhythm Room worthy."}
{"text":"This place is really great!  Such a nice atmosphere to sit outside around the trees and sparkling lights.  Wonderful pizza and fresh made pasta specials.  Happy hour is a great time to go get inexpensive but delicious wine and appetizer options.  I recommend the antipasta speciale, burrata, polpette, and arancini for appetizers, la noce, di notte, and tartufata for pizza.  They may not have pasta every night, but I had the BEST pasta with shrimp.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We had an absolutely lovely weeknight dinner here.  The patio was shaded, the misters gently cooling us, and the gorgeous landscape providing a relaxing atmosphere.  The cappuccino, quattro fromaggi pizza, the Margherita pizza, gnocchi, pear salad, and the banana  nutella crepe were great.  Probably the only thing I might not order again would be the pear salad as it didn't seem to be the greatest value.  The pizzas and crepe were PERFECT!  Soft, yet chewy crust delicately supporting the toppings with just a bit of gorgonzola on the quattro pizza!"}
{"text":"The pizza and calzones are just OK here.  I've been here several times.  The atmosphere is pretty good, especially at night.  I wish the food was a bit better though. For the pizza, I found the sauce a bit watery and crust to be mediocre.  The calzones are OK but I've had better.  The appetizers are OK as well.  I did enjoy the dessert.

However, the staff has been quite friendly every time I go to meet friends there."}
{"text":"I *love* Cibo. End of story. 

Not really, but it's just that simple. Their gluten-free pizza is by far the best pizza I have ever had.

I've been so many times and yet, I'm always too enamored with the food to remember to take pictures. Most recently, my mom, grandma and I ate an early dinner prior to a show, around 2:30 on a Saturday. 

It was not busy and we were able to get our order in quickly.

I always start with the pesto salad, it's so fresh. It's big though, enough for 3-4 people to easily share. 

We also ordered the Marinara and Procida pizzas to share. 

The Procida was amazing, my new favorite (bumping the La Noca to second place). The Procida is mozzarella, prosciutto, pear, arugula and goat cheese. To. Die. For.

The Marinara wasn't my favorite but only because it wasn't one I would normally order. I don't like capers or anchovies, they both are too salty for me. The other two at my table loved it though!

The price is great too, considering the quality, taste, and atmosphere. 

If you haven't been to Cibo, you're missing out on one of the great pizza places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Always impressed with my experience here.  Food is amazing, wine menu is long and dessert crepe is well worth over stuffing yourself for."}
{"text":"It's just like pizza bianco without the wait. This pizza is a 9.9999 and bianco is a 10. This place has a much larger menu and their deserts are to die for. 

If bianco has more then a 30 min wait just drive and or walk here."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and the best cappuccino I have had in a long time. This is an all time favorite in Downtown PHX."}
{"text":"A swing and a miss.

If you're gonna serve $15 pizzas and NOT serve bread, there is something clearly not okay (even CPK does it for crying out loud). Maybe it was the fact that there were 15 of us that our server was never around. Maybe it was because it was my birthday they decided to give attitude whenever we requested more drinks. 

Pizzas were sub-par from what I had expected, don't throw a couple slices of bell pepper and bits of zucchini and call it a vegetarian pizza. Plain cheese pizza was on the very-salty side. Drinks were not getting refilled and not once was I checked up on after food was served.

Not cool, Cibo!  Not cool at all!"}
{"text":"I'm convinced they have the best ambiance and service. I came about 1 hour before they closed on a Monday night after class and was waiting a good 25 minutes for a friend to meet me there. Our server Tom (I think that's his name?) checked up on me and made sure I had water and he didn't forget about me while I was waiting. He even moved a heat lamp closer to the table since we sat outside and it was chilly, so that was really nice.

We ordered the Vegetariana pizza, bruschetta, and crepe Suzette. My friend had a wine drink and I had the iced tea. The pizza is a pretty big, so I think it can be shared by 3 people or so. Because it was just the 2 of us, there were leftovers. It was flavorful but light, which is what I like. I'm not into heavy or salty foods, so that pizza was perfect! The bruschetta had pretty big portions too, which I think could easily feed 6 people (1 each) and we had leftovers for that, too. Bruschetta was garlicky and aromatic. The tomato one was kinda salty for me... so I ate more bread than tomatoes, but otherwise the one with beans really hit the spot. I always get crepe Suzette wherever it's offered. My friend wasn't impressed, but I thought it was quite lovely.

I'm glad I found fabulous little gem!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy. Good for lunch for the downtown crowd. It's nice to have something that's not in the business district."}
{"text":"Cibo is consistently amazing! They're pizza and appetizers are always excellent. They really take pride in their customer service and quality of food. I'd recommend this place over and over again!"}
{"text":"I grade my pizza on the crust. Although I eat a GF diet, I don't skimp on my pizza as GF pizza is too sweet due to the substitution of GF flour. This is legit pizza and crust that can rival some of the best pizza in the valley. I'll definitely go again, but try a different set of toppings."}
{"text":"Cute old home in residential old hood. Good food. Good service. Best when the weather is cool so you can sit outside."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! They have great pizza. Their pizza is thin crust and always cooked to perfection! We actually ordered the pasta & meatballs the last time we were there and both was delicious.

Must get - their dessert. The strawberry & Nutella crepe. I had to fight my hubby off the damn thing. Pricing is also very reasonable. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Probably not a lot new I can say about cibo except they're awesome.  Most recently wife and I went with our 13 month old son after work on Friday.  Not only are they a nice date place to go before a night out, but they also can accommodate our toddler with finger foods and friendly service.  

Baby B loved his meatballs and chewy pizza crust, while momma had the Di Notti, and I had the Rustica because it has arugula on top which makes me feel I'm eating healthy.  The sparrows got a healthy dose of pizza crust too because B is a bit of a messy eater. 

We always do the patio, and love sitting outside in this nice old Phoenix neighborhood.  Let the tourists go to Bianco; locals know Cibo is better, and you don't have to wait four hours for a table."}
{"text":"I came to this place with a friend, who raves about this place so I was excited to finally try it after all the hype that is was given on behalf of my friend. Sadly to say, I have had better pizza at a similar type restaurant to Cibo. The pizza that I had was soggy and had no flavor. I was very disappointed and do not believe that pizza should be eaten with a knife and fork. The only thing I liked was the dessert, which was the nutella crepe. I will never come pack here and stick to my favorite urban pizzaria, which is La Bocca in Tempe."}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere were so bad that we left before we ordered anything. So my score is not based on the food, which I hear is delicious. 

We were seated behind some obnoxiously loud lady who was over-explaining to her friend how poorly her coworker taught K-12 chemistry...and was getting almost everything wrong herself (I have a PhD in molecular genetics, so the convo was like listening to nails scraping a chalkboard). That's neither here nor there. Our bad experience was enhanced by this.

So barely being able to hear myself think, I try to order a drink. The cocktail selection stinks for a place that appears to have an open bar. Plus, the waitress wasn't very helpful at all. She offered the peach bellini and then quickly retracted when she noted that they were out of the peach ingredient. Really?

Then trying my best to speak over Loud-Talker explaining that all you needed to demonstrate \"splitting atoms\" is two styrofoam balls and a toothpick...nuclear fission with toothpicks...I asked the waitress if they had anything akin to an Italian soda, or maybe a soda/ seltzer with a splash of vodka and some flavor. What I figured was a simple request was impossible at Cibo.

We left as Loud-Talker proclaimed that grade school kids don't need to learn chemistry, just general science...and we wonder why AZ's 8th graders rank #45 in the nation in STEM topics.

All in all, our waitress was aloof from the moment we sat down. She was either spaced out or just had no people skills. Having the atmosphere ruined by Ms. Loud-Talker was our own bad luck, but I still give this place one star for the poor service.

We left and went to The Vig next door. That place rocks."}
{"text":"We stopped in on our last night before our flight back home from The Grand Canyon. Cute place in the center of a residential area. Very nice outside patio/garden area but we opted to eat inside as they allowed smoking right outside the perimeter of the patio area. We had 3 out of our party of 6 who are gf by choice to myself, being very gluten sensitive & extremely sick when ingesting even small amounts of gluten. Most of us had pizza & were very satisfied. I had a gf Basil pesto pizza that had roasted potatoes on it. I wasn't a huge fan of the potatoes but they did not allow substitutions & did not have build your own option. It would have been amazing with some org. chicken breast on it & I did tell our waiter that.  The crust was amazing for a gf pizza crust, you would never have known it was gf if it didn't come out with a gf flag on each gf pizza. 5+ stars on the crust. One in our party had a calzone with sausage & the sausage was very spicy hot. She had to pick most of it out just too hot for her. Would have been good to warn those ordering sausage about that. One in our party had calamari as his entree & it was just okay, not great. Looked like french fries, different than any I have ever seen. Most of us got crepes for desert. They had a buckwheat gf version, which I got. They were all amazing! All in all a good meal with great service. We will def go back if ever in the phoenix area again."}
{"text":"This place was spectaculars sat outside with friends and the food and decide was exceptional!"}
{"text":"Yelped this place because of its food review and kid friendly menu we decided to eat there; came in at 2pm or so. The host sat us and gave us a \"Cena\" menu - what ever.

But then it got weird, we waited 5 minutes before she came back (place had a few people) and we asked for the. Kids menu. She took another 5 minutes and returned with a kids menu that said 5pm. We asked if they serves pasta and she said well not for lunch but for dinner only. So I am confused is this lunch or dinner. She was not very informed about the menu yet alone the hours of service - yikes."}
{"text":"I came to this place with a friend, who raves about this place so I was excited to finally try it after all the hype that is was given on behalf of my friend.

{"text":"the glasses has water marks on them. I don't like animals around while I'm eating and they had a roaming cat there. idk if it was a stray or not but they sure didn't try to get it to leave. the pizza dough was still raw in the middle. looked like they where in a rush to make the pizza cause it had a bunch of holes. was flimsy af, as soon as I picked up the slice it immediately flopped down and everything just slid off. sauce wasn't even good. would have rather gotten Papa John's."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had a couple of appetizers. Could have done without the calamari..pretty bland. Had the Il Tagliere which was great. Service was also great. We'll come back and try the pizza at some point!"}
{"text":"Cibo has plenty of reviews, but I still gotta put my two cents in! I have been here several times, all for lunch, so I have NOT tried their pizza yet but the sandwiches and salads they serve up for lunch are nothing short of phenominal! On my last vist I tried the Ai Spinaci, which is a garlic lovers dream sandwich topped off with wilted spinach and toasted prosciutto! All I hear is great things about Cibo's pizza, so I can't wait to finally give it a try!

The restaurant is a beautifully converted house in a historic downtown area, but that also equals very limited seating inside. They have a great patio with more than ample overflow seating outside, but it's pretty worthless during the summer days. The servers here are all friendly towards the customers, and work as a team to make sure the lunch and dinner hours run smoothly!

Also, the crepes are amazing! We never had any intention of ordering dessert but our server insisted on bringing us a complimentary crepe with the assurance that it'd be worth it! WE LOVED IT! Make sure you save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Street parking is not fun, only a 15 minute wait for a table, the ambience was romantic, the antipasta and pizza was tasty and the customer services was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Tried the $16 lunch special which includes a small portion of pasta, side and salad. It was okay but edible. (Okay the beets were yummy.) Had a glass of Sangiovese and it was okay. I expected for for a restaurant on 17th but it is what it is."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but our food was DELICIOUS, the ambiance was comfortable and inviting, and the service was great. They accommodated my family of 7 with a reservation and we sat outside. It was an absolutely beautiful experience and I will DEFINITELY be coming here again.

I took my two small children (2 and 4) and while there wasn't anything about the restaurant that was overtly bad for kids, a lot of people go to have a nice talk over dinner and relax, and, well, my kids (like most their age) are beyond boisterous so I probably won't take them again just to spare the other guests. 

The two things that made me a little uncomfortable were the mosquitoes outside and the lack of lighting outside. I went when the sun was setting and it was a bit hard to read the menu, but I asked our server to turn some lights on and when she did all was well :) 

Added to my favorite local phoenix dining destinations!!"}
{"text":"Yummy pizza! Perfect service. The best part you don't have to wait hours to get a yummy brick oven pizza!!"}
{"text":"Love Cibo, the simple presence of this restaurant in the neighborhood is really good for the revitalization of downtown. 

The salsicce sandwich and house salad are amazing and the staff is great. totally recommend"}
{"text":"Top notch pizza with plenty of red or white options. Nice, charming patio seating area. Looks like it was converted from a house. Just came back from italy and this place is just as good or better than pizza places there."}
{"text":"Finally!  Finally I ate here after nearly 2 years of desert dwelling. Sheesh.

So good.  I was with someone who is gluten intolerant and we got our pizza gluten free. I never would've known.  Tasted like regular ol' gluten filled crust to me.  

We started with the Ostia Salad, which is huge.  More than enough for two to share. The chickpea dressing is different, but in a good way.  Think runnier hummus.  The fried parsnips were a unique touch and the croutons. wow.

The highlight was the Tartufata pizza.  White Truffle Oil. That's all I'm gonna say there. I detest mushrooms so I had my half without the fungus.  The prosciutto was crispy and the truffle oil made the pizza decadent and rich.

Cibo definitely lived up to the hype!"}
{"text":"Cibo is has a completely new menu and chef, we had dinner there last night and it was absolutely amazing! For appetizers, The three of us split the flatbread special - Italian sausage and hot peppers and also the warm olives. The olives were delightful, warmed and tossed with various herbs and orange peel. The flatbread itself was light and full of flavor. 

We also shared two salads, beets with arugula, pear, hazelnuts. The butter lettuce salad was wonderful with gorgeous butter lettuce, large striped radishes and brown butter croutons. The white truffle oil vinaigrette was divine! 

Cibo now does half portions of their pastas. Which was great for us so we could share everything. I ordered a half of the Beef Sugo, Tender pulled beef braised in red wine and balsamic over fettuccini with pecorino and thyme. I'm not much a red meat eater but this was a really great! I would definitely order this one again. Another dining companion ordered the ricotta cappelletti, only had a bite but it was delicious and light with lots of fresh basil. Another ordered the mussels for dinner. I don't really eat mussels themselves but I dipped some of the grilled bread that it is served with into white wine, garlic, Meyer lemon and fennel pollen sauce and WOW!! It had such a great consistency and a nice yet subtle fennel flavor. I could honestly eat this sauce and bread for an entire meal!! We also shared a side of spinach saut√©ed in sherry vinegar with golden raisins and pine nuts. The dish was tangy yet sweet with a nice crunch from the pine nuts, loved it. 

For dessert, we shared a Blood orange and almond cake with juniper cream. It was a little denser and colder than I expected to be but we all really enjoyed the flavors. They also serve a really nice selection of Mighty Leaf teas and 19 coffee and espresso. 

Overall, it was a wonderful experience. Service was very nice and they've updated the artwork and light fixtures. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Love, Love this place!! We have been coming here for years and have watched the place grow based on the wonderful food, great service and lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here with my Girlfriend in our one month anniversary... I really liked the experience... Great food and great Service. Parking was a bit of a hassle but it was fine. Definitely recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"This place has a special spot in my heart (my boyfriend and I had our first date here). We usually start the dinner waiting at the bar with a bottle of wine. The bartenders know their stuff! They always recommend an awesome wine. When we get a table, we know what we want immediately. My favorite pizza is La Noce. Ricotta, tomato sauce, walnuts and we add proscuitto: it is to die for. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the last two times we've gone, our server was less than attentive. After waiting 35 minutes and drinking almost a bottle of wine, we want to order! I love this place, amazing food, gorgeous patio and friendly bar staff."}
{"text":"UNREAL. Not only the most adorable quaint setting, but amazing food to boot! My favorite of the night was the burrata appetizer (wow). We also had calamari and a few different pizzas, and it was all amazing. Wish we had saved room for the dessert but we were just too full... oh well, another reason to go back ASAP! ;)"}
{"text":"This place is adorable. A nice little detour from the airport to eat dinner while traffic dies down.  Wine was a bit pricey, but a large salad and pizza shared between two was a great meal."}
{"text":"Cibo is just a couple blocks from my office and I have to say it's some damn good pizza. I visited there with a couple work buddies for their birthday party a couple months ago. The owners were there hobnobbing with the patrons as the passed out FREE Margherita pizza and two dollar beers. Good beer too! I got a Lagunita's Little Sumpin. 

Aside from their awesome basically free birthday bash I have been several times before.

The starters are delicious and usually change with the season's (I believe). The charcuterie plate is a great way to get your night going with some red wine. It's called Il Tagliere and it really gets me going. The other starters are great too (honestly the starters are better than the pizza)

The pizza is delicious but not my favorite in the valley. They do Neapolitan style with a nice sweet dough that is a little chewy. I really can't say much about the pizza besides the fact that it is really good but i prefer the  za's at POMO, Bianco, and strangely La Grande Orange. That being said I have only tried the margherita and the fresco...

ALSO! If you happen to be there when they are serving pasta, ditch the pizza and get the pasta you will not regret it."}
{"text":"We came here on a busy Saturday night after a Cactus League baseball game.  It's kind of in a weird Phoenix neighborhood, but we really liked the vibe inside.  We had to wait for just a little while to get in.  We were attracted to the availability of a gluten-free pizza.  

For starters, we had the pear salad on arugula, which was very good.  We went with a capricciosa pizza with prosciutto, mushrooms and artichokes.  It came out super hot and the crust was really good and crispy, even though gluten-free. 

The service was very friendly and helpful.  I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Cibo is actually a house that's been converted to a restaurant. There is seating and a small bar area inside, as well as outside patio seating in the front yard. The outdoor area has white lights strung up among the trees, very cute. This all makes for a wonderful atmosphere: charming during the day and romantic at night! 

The service is also great. Our waiter was friendly, knowledgable about the menu and made some solid recommendations for us.

On to the food: The pizza is AMAZING! I think Cibo is way better than Pizzeria Bianco. The crust is thin, but it's still doughy and a little chewy. We ordered the Salciccia (tomato sauce, sausage and cheese) and the De Notte (4 cheeses, spicy salame, no sauce). The sausage tastes like it has rosemary in it and the salame is indeed quite spicy. 

Delicious!"}
{"text":"This was a delight for a weekend social meeting with a friend.  I was happy that they were open with a breakfast menu even though we didn't meet until noon. I will keep the 10AM weekend opening in mind.

The weather was predicted to be a bit warm so we opted for an interior seat. The service was prompt. I mentioned that we weren't in a hurry and would probably take our time and chat.  The waitress returned timely with drink refills, but we felt no pressure to hurry our meal.  Plus #1.

We had the Saltimbocca Freddi and Fritatta Melfitana for the main course. Very fresh ingrediants prepared to perfection.  Plus #2

The BIG Plus #3 was the dessert.  Dessert for breakfast...YES!!  We decided to try both sweet crepes and share. This is a great option because both were so good that I couldn't have picked just one.  Nuttella and Mascarpone was warm. The waitress mentioned topping it with ice cream which was a perfect recommendation.  Frutti di Bosco was topped with mixed berries that were so perfect that you wanted to pick them off the crepe with your hands and just pop them in your mouth.  Maybe that is a good reason to get one of your own?

I also noticed that the hostess seated people throughout the restaurant, giving everyone a lot of personal space.  

Highly recommended for a weekend meal if you are in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"This location is fantastic on a warm (but comfortable!) summer night. Live jazz band in the outdoor seating area is fantastic as well. Exterior and location is one of a kind in the area--and appeared to be the only restaurant or just a generic place taking customers in.

We of course took advantage of the cute scenery outside and decided to eat near the band. The waiter was very accommodating and patient with our seating decisions since we became a bit indecisive on where we wanted to sit in order to enjoy the entire environment. Food! tried two of their pizzas: Margherita and Salsiccia Con Patate (sausage and roasted potatoes on their white sauce pizza, this was superb!!) I thought I would end up feasting on the Margherita in case the Salsiccia Con Patate didn't pan out well, but this ended up being the dish of the night. 

Cibo had a range of customers and occassions celebrated when we went. I would come here for a first date, 50th date, 55th birthday, any type of occasion."}
{"text":"Tucked away in downtown Phoenix, this local restaurant has character and amazing food! In my first, and definitely not last trip, enjoyed the Ai Spinaci. Which is truly a treat for your taste buds!  Perfectly saut√©ed spinach, savory prosciutto cotto and fontina cheese, yum!"}
{"text":"One of my fave restaurants in the Roosevelt district in downtown Phoenix.  The food is always fantastic. But if you can go here in the Spring or Fall - do it!  The patio has such a fantastic ambiance - one of my favorite outdoor dining places in the Valley.  Parking can be tough, but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Loved the ambience and food! Server was super friendly and helpful with dope unique earrings that I loved!  Next time I'm in town visiting I'll be sure to be back!!"}
{"text":"My first visit here was during YYC Hot Chocolate Fest. They had one of the winning hot chocolates. I stopped in, sat at the bar and partook in their wine infused hot chocolate, a glass of wine and some of the Scodellina. 

This building used to be a video place and they've done a great job remodeling. My recent visit had us seated on the patio (lovely and very private) for lunch and a business meeting. Not having a big appetite on hot days, two of us ordered the lunch special. Pizza, salad and a scodellina. It was all very good and the right size for a lighter lunch. 

A fun place to experience, with good food. They are also family friendly and I can't wait to bring the family in for pizza one night."}
{"text":"Cibo has a great patio, a few quality happy hour offerings, and the exciting promise of gluten free pizza. Sadly, the good things about it didn't make up for the not so good things. On the plus side, the polenta fries were fantastic and the wife was a big fan of the gnocchi. On the minus side, the pizza was relatively tasteless (like it needed salt) and I'm pretty sure it made me sick. I don't know if it was the gluten free option or the cheese, of which I rarely eat, but I woke up the next morning violently ill. My wife ate the same thing and didn't have a problem, so perhaps it was a fluke. Either way, it just didn't excite us the way the Yelp reviews did. Much sadness ensued."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is beautiful..very nice ambiance.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to have a sit-down meal, so I did pick-up and ordered my meal ahead of time.  The pizza was meh...I've definitely had better pizza than that! The dough got a little soggy by the time I got to my hotel room 15 minutes later..so that didn't help either."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, great service, family environment in a beautiful setting.  That sounds like a tagline on a website, but it's legit.  The diavola and the salsiccia are my faves.  Just amazingly tasty, simple, pizza with quality ingredients made the right way in a brick oven.  Pizzeria Bianco might have em by an inch just based on pizza alone, but if you don't want to wait 2.5 hours for a pie, Cibo is the place to be, and almost as good.  And although Bianco has a 2.5 hour wait whereupon i generally drink wine for the duration(which might be part of the reason the pie is so good), the limoncello at Cibo generally floors me just as well in a quarter of the time.."}
{"text":"The place is always packed.  The ambiance is perfect.  We do take out a lot from there, but it's really hard to get in and out of because they are SO busy!

Our favorite pizza is the Capricciosa.  We've had their Calzone but it's not as good.  Maybe someday, we'll try some other items, but for now, we know and love their pizza!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance and the food! Last night was my second time to Cibo and they have yet to disappoint. I've enjoyed dinner on both the patio and inside, and both are equally charming. Great place for a date night if that's what you're looking for. The only reason I rated this experience a 4 out of 5 is because of the time it took for the server to take our orders and bring our check. (We were headed to an event downtown after dinner and were limited on time)"}
{"text":"How can I not have written a review about one my DT Phx staples!!!!??? 

Eat here! Order pizza. Probably my favourite in town. They will make it however you like. The crust is always thin and light and topped with fresh veggies, smothered in melty artisan cheeses... 

Excuse me while I sop up the drool pooling around my keyboard. 

Try the specials. Pasta is cooked just right and topped and seasoned with delicious, hearty sauces. Plates are always big enough to share. Great date spot!!

Never leave without desert please! Can you say Nutella crepe!?!?!? 

Not to mention the meal complementing selection of spirits... 

Cibo, I love you. My life would not be complete without you. My favourite place to have a bite with my tiny, bring new friends, ladies night, or any other excuse I can muster."}
{"text":"Delicious good value for lunch, large venue where we knew we could enter without reservations (I'm sure that's not always the case).  Staff was attentive and food was very good."}
{"text":"I have a coworker who refuses to eat pizza anywhere else. I think I've been converted as well! The pizza here is top notch and the pricing is actually really reasonable. Co worker is gluten free and I've tried both the GF pizza and the 'normal': they both taste phenomenal. The blend of cheeses is unique and they have super fresh crust. The resultant itself is very stylish and perfect for a girlfriend luncheon or date night. I will be back, and I will be bringing other friends who need to be converted."}
{"text":"I love good pizza, really love good pizza. And Cibo has the best that I have ever had. They have your choice of white or red pizzas - they have this white pizza with italian meats that is addicting. Their salads are delicious too and you can't beat their desserts with Nutella. I enjoy Cibo because their ingredients are so fresh and everything is simple but amazing in taste. Their staff is always so friendly - you can really tell they enjoy working for this place and serving the food - they are truly excited about it. This place I'm a fan of and a definite regular."}
{"text":"The best pizza I have tried ever! I have been to over 15 different countries, nothing like it. The tartufata is a must if you like truffles. The service was good and attentive. The outdoors was beautiful and relaxing. For dessert check out the Nutella cr√™pe. Definitely coming back on my next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is really yummy!!! Definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a really good Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Cibo! Cibo! Cibo!  I love you and your cute old farm house, your amazing pizza, affordable wine, awesome crepe desserts, and fabulous staff!

I want to live in the apartment above the restaurant!! 

Go to Cibo for awesome food, charming atmosphere, and a great time for a girls night or on a date.  Cibo has quickly become my favorite place in Phoenix! 

*They're closed on Sundays...found this out the hard way."}
{"text":"In town on business.  Great food, great service, great crapes, good selection of local beer and the price was right."}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved this place. There's something so rustic and romantic about it, with it's quaint cottage look and glowing string lights above their outside seating. I was visiting my old roommate in Arizona and she took me to this place for some authentic Italian eats, the usual catch up wine and dine.

It's a little nondescript as the street holds no other restaurants, but it adds to the homey vibe. We went for simple and grabbed the cacio e pepe (a dish of noodles with pepper and parmesan that allows the homemade pasta to shine) and the Tartufata pizza. The pizza was amazing with a woodfired crust, crispy prosciutto, and the light taste of truffle oil. Definitely get it if you're a fan of white pizzas. Altogether, I loved how classic the dishes were.

As for service, it was solid. Our water was always kept filled and they were really patient when we were struggling over what to order.

This is definitely a place with a really intimate feel and is a popular date spot, as we were surrounded by parties of two. However, don't let that deter you from grabbing a bite with old friends.

And finally, if you had any doubts like I did, it's pronounced CHEE-boh. You're welcome."}
{"text":"I love restaurants that have a good vibe, and this is just the place. They always have a live jazz band, pretty lights, and amazing food! Everyone should come here if they are in the area! I guarantee you'll love it!"}
{"text":"I lived in Naples Italy, this takes me right back there!! Awesome, I had the Margherita Pizza, first bite brought back memories."}
{"text":"Warm, friendly, happening, loud (just loud enough), great italian food, good alcohol selection, lively environment, large and spacious, parking at the back... 
What else could you ask for on 17th Ave?!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! Friendly staff and really nice owner. We ordered appetizers, pizzas and dessert. Everything was great! The calamari was excellent!"}
{"text":"Cibo's only been open for a couple weeks, and tonight was our first time there.  The short version: decent food, innovative ingredients, nice staff, but will get better as they work out some kinks.

Longer version: We ordered three small appetizers (roasted eggplant dip was ah-mazing!); for mains, I had the chicken salad and my date had pasta.  Both dishes were excellent, though not very large.  We would have been hungry with the mains if not for having the appetizers.  Each main was about $14.  Next time, I would probably order 3 mains to split among 2 people, or do the appetizers with mains.

The space is kind of warehouse slash chic; concrete and wood floors, hanging lights, long bars.  One major risk is that drinks can be knocked off the bar on to the table below in the front half of the restaurant; this happened twice while we were there.

All in all, a nice place that will only improve as they smooth out the wrinkles!"}
{"text":"Nice spot for Pizza, like a lunch or dinner date.
Hopefully you don't decide to come early on a Sunday as I have attempted before.
Definitely prefer this to pizzeria bianco - price and food."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! This place was SO good! I had been to Cibo before, and loved it, but after trying their life changing Neapolitan-style pizza, I felt so compelled to write a review! Me and my two friends shared the La Noce pizza + one of their homemade pasta specials. We were told they only serve these dishes twice a week (& that's when you know a place has fresh food)! Everything was spot on, and we had no complaints or regrets! 

The location itself is as cute as it gets. The first time I came here I sat outside and enjoyed every second I spent on their adorable patio. This past time I was in, I sat inside, but still thoroughly enjoyed my surrounding environment! Our server was very friendly, patient, and helped make my friend's birthday so awesome. At the end of our meal, she brought us a Nutella crepe with a candle on top! The crepe was so delicious that we decided to try one more dessert... Because what the heck! We got the Frutti Di Bosco crepe with mascarpone filling. The flavor was simply intriguing and all I have to say is YOU HAVE TO TRY IT. 

Thank you Cibo for a memorable evening. Everything was amazing, and I will continue to come here for years to come!"}
{"text":"Anybody who doesn't love their pizza is a fool. This has to be the best pizza in all of Arizona. The crust is cooked to perfection. The sauce is seasoned just right. The cheese is just enough. They have nailed what pizza should be. Even their gluten-free pizza is amazing. I could eat their pizza everyday. The hot olive oil is definitely a wonderful add to the pizza, just ask for it. 
The atmosphere is quite refreshing. I very much prefer to sit outside, weather permitting. Especially having little children they can get a little rowdy inside and they echo. I also think the seating inside is a little tight. Especially with a larger group more than five. Which is why we really like the outside seating. Sometimes still a little close depending on where you are seated but less likely to notice the noise level on the group we always have. 
The prices are very reasonable for the quality and size of the food. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Such a cute spot! It's easy to miss since the location it doesn't look like there's a restaurant there since it's almost in a residential area. 

Very intimate place to go for dinner especially when sitting outside. I love the ambiance of this place. The food is great as well! The truffle fries were definitely to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, a third update-- I'm a creature of habit. Cibo's Rustica pizza (requested extra crispy) and pesto salad have a spot in my wildest dreams."}
{"text":"great pizza! Portions of food are very small. plate of pasta is fit for a kid not a adult. must be half Jewish cause real Italians never let you leave hungry!"}
{"text":"LOVED the ambience inside.  Nice view of the pizza oven.  The salad and sandwich I had during lunch with a friend were stellar!  Wished I could say the same about the pizza I had for dinner... Then again, I'm a fan of thin-crust pizzas, and the pie I had was too thick and dough-y IMO.  I took home a pie for Mom, and she didn't care for it, either.  

Liked the patio seating, although I had arrived too early for the candlelight atmosphere to cast a full effect of romance over me.  The neighborhood-feel did make me wish I lived downtown..."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful birthday dinner at CIBO last night. This was about the 3rd or 4th time visiting this quaint house turned restaurant, and now is the time to YELP. 
CIBO has wonderful appetizer of antipasti that played with my taste buds! Fun to make your own brushettas.... 
My husband and I shared the Rustica delightful, delicious, delectable.... 
And the creps...what can I say...I didn't need it, but I wanted it, so I had it, so there! Fresca creps with fruit, vanilla ice cream and fresh whip....Mmmm...food coma. Lovely service and birthday!"}
{"text":"I love going to this place very chance I can get. Love the pizza! but they don't call it pizza though its hardcore original Italian restaurant even the beer! Nothing American here just good old Italian food!!! Must try"}
{"text":"The lunch menu is good and the fruit salad with the sandwich makes an awesome duo. It's a little pricy, but well worth it."}
{"text":"I have found my new favourite restaurant in Calgary! After a girlfriend suggested Cibo for our dinner date, I admit I was less than thrilled. Although I had heard good things, a quick menu check online didn't really excite me, I found nothing to be that interesting or drool worthy. Nevertheless, there we were. We were seated upstairs at a lovely table near the bar, and I was already hooked. The decor and ambiance of this restaurant is perfect. Although it is loud (almost too loud, which would be my only complaint), it's very energetic and fun. We ordered the aranchini to share, as well as the mixed greens and the prosciutto and pineapple pizza. Everything was absolutely fantastic. We also split two desserts and each had a chocolate martini. Our server was the sweetest little thing and everything came out perfectly timed and expertly cooked. I was blown away, so I took my boyfriend back the very next week. We also shared the aranchini and mixed greens, but we had the lamb meatballs and the spaghetti for 2 meal. Once again, I was blown away by the quality of the food, service, and price! It is seriously a steal to eat here. I am absolutely in LOVE with Cibo and I will make it a point to return again and again!"}
{"text":"We were here a couple of weekends ago for a friend's private party for her graduation from law school. We had heard a lot about Cibo and how great the pizza is, and it did not disappoint! We were out in the little carriage house behind the main restaurant due to the event being a private one, and it was so stinking cute! We had an open bar so we were just drinking the basic white & red wines they had, but whatever they were they were tasty! We were also happy to find that they carry Deschute's Fresh Squeezed IPA which is by far one of our favorite beers. For the food, we had lasagna, the meat & cheese board, a mixed salad, several types of pizza, and nutella crepes as a final treat! Basically, we were absolutely STUFFED by the time we left, but it was because the food was so good we wanted to keep eating it even after reaching the full point haha. I can't speak much to the cost of things, since again we were lucky enough to have all of our drinks & food taken care of by the hosts, but I can absolutely say that we will be giving Cibo another try for an upcoming date night!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Amazing service; I felt welcomed from the moment I walked in the door. Excellent Pinot Noir paired with my meal. 
Restrooms are a little tricky, right by the kitchen, got bumped by fellow patrons and staff; none the less did not detract from my experience!"}
{"text":"Cibo is one of my favorite restaurants here in the valley.  It has everything that I'm looking for.  Excellent food (pizza), good prices, great vibe and scene.  I have been here several times, but we last visited Cibo the other day so it refreshed my memory.  Plus, I realized that I never reviewed it before!

Anyways, we came on a Tuesday afternoon during happy hour.  It was such a nice spring Phoenix afternoon that we sat outside in their patio.  Actually, this is all we have ever sat at on our prior visits.  It's because I absolutely love their patio.  It really feels like I'm eating in a outdoor garden.  Such a cool and great feel, one of the main reasons why we keep coming back.  The inside is also very nice, Cibo is a converted home into a restaurant, but we just prefer to sit on the patio.

For the happy hour menu they have several appetizers from $4-$6 dollars, plus $4 house wines and $2.5 Peronis.  We ordered the Polpette (meatballs with bread).  It was great, Cibo's sauce was amazing and a great compliment to the meatballs.  

We also ordered from the pizza menu, the Diavola with added ricotta cheese.  It was a tomato based sauce pizza with spicy salame.  Our server recommend that  we add ricotta cheese.  I'm glad that we did, this was a great pizza.  it was perfectly cooked.  Crust was flakey, yet soft.  The ricotta added a nice creamy texture.  We really enjoyed our pizza, and with the appetizer it was a good amount of food for my wife and i to split.

We ended up passing on dessert, but have had their crepes before and they were excellent.

I really can't say much more about Cibo.  Again it is one of our go to places to eat while we are in downtown Phoenix.  This is a perfect place to enjoy a nice romantic meal at decent prices.  Can't really beat the value here, nor the food.   We look forward to coming back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Really didn't love it, and really REALLY wanted to since it's within walking distance of our home.  The place seems to be having an identity crisis- upscale vs. neighborhood spot, trendy vs. homey, fine dining vs... Olive Garden?  Cold (ie refrigerated, bought elsewhere, couldn't even be bothered to pop it in the oven for show) bread in an Italian restaurant left a bad taste from the start, and the food was over-salted and heavy- nothing you couldn't make at home.  The corkage fee has been commented on but bears mentioning again- totally over the top.  This review is a bit late- we tried it in the summer- so we're going back for another shot and hoping for better."}
{"text":"OK, my girlfriend and i were wanting to eat some Italian food, as she had just flown in from Chicago and the place that we really like has closed. Once we figured out that it was closed and got over the fact that we were going to miss eating there, we got on \"Yelp\" and started looking for an alternative. I also have a POI in my car that will give you names and locations or places close to where you are, between the two devices the place that both suggested was a place called \"Cibo\".

We live downtown and we thought, \"What the hell, it's close to the house and we haven't been there\". The only prerequisite that my girlfriend gave me was \"NO Pizza's\",as  she had just gotten back from Chicago and had pizza the night before. We get to this place and we had driven by it a million times, great patio and just packed on a Friday Night. We went in and decided to just eat at the bar since the wait was so long, she went to wash her hands and I took a look at the menu, 100% Pizza. By the way, she is Gluten Free, so I'm thinking were out of here and back to our search. Well the bartender comes up and we tell her our dilemma, she explains that they have the best \"Gluten Free Pizza in the World\". She just so happened to be \"Gluten Free\" also. So we decided let's go for it.

I am half Italian and was raised with Pizza, it was left overs on a pie crust., my grandfather put everything in the fridge on his Pizza. I'm not a big fan of Pizza for that reason, i still think of it as a way to get rid of leftovers.

Simply the best Pizza i have ever had in my life, \"Gluten Free\" or otherwise. This place is a gem and we will be spending a lot of time at this place moving forward. All weekend all we could think about was how good the Pizza was on Friday.

Go there if you haven't and you will love the atmosphere and especially the Pizza. If your \"Gluten Free\" it's a bonus because your in for a treat. I have found my only Pizza place from this moment forward. I will not go out to eat Pizza unless it is at Cibo's. I just can't even tell you how great it is, you will have to just try it yourself. 

I Love Me Some Cibo..."}
{"text":"Cibo's pies are ambrosial. 
Wood fired, thin crusted and a chewy crumb all combine to produce a pizza that will rival any of the famous New York eateries, including Rays. Their pies in a word are simply delectable.

Situated in a 1913 ranch house, your seating options are limited to:

* Small bedrooms, appointed similarly to a 1913 small bedroom; about a half dozen 
   tables with about 15-20 people to a room. If you want an intimate experience, these
   rooms aren't the place. Despite their talking softly, I still overheard the next table's
   plans for In Vitro, and since my wife was absent any form of communication, I 
   can proudly say I know just about all there is to know about In Vitro fertilization.
   Thanks bunches to you two for speckling my lunch with all your sperm speak.

* The bar area is also small but quaint and nicely appointed. I'm guessing you need 
   to time your arrival with the exact moment they unlock their doors if you have
   any designs on bar-flying it. 

* The patio area, where no misters abound, is certain to transform your date into 
   a sweaty Betty just moments after being seated. Perfect for old hippie chicks who 
   still sport patchouli as their primary cleansing function.

Cibo's parking is limited. Your choices are street parking or street parking. And remember, you're in downtown Phoenix...the same streets playing host to every ass-wart of societal humanity, so be sure to lock your car, set your alarm, and put your valuables in the trunk. 

Overall, Cibo wins high praises for its fare, despite its quirkiness, lack of parking, and low sperm count patronage."}
{"text":"We were driving through Phoenix and found this place on Yelp. The outdoor patio was lovely, though it was too hot to sit outside at 5:00 p.m. The food was wonderful: a delicious and generous helping of burata, meatballs, and an arugala salad as good as any I've had.  The service was cheerful and efficient."}
{"text":"So this place did a lot right, and only miss steeped a few times-plus very good food. 

The servos was great! Very good recommendations and follow through. Server even suggested a change to my pizza that the staff enjoys-it really made it nice. The problem with it was once she checked on my beer choice that was the lady time I saw her until I was completely finished. Small mistake to an almost perfect meal.

The food was insane-very tasty!! The pizza combined typical Flavors of fresh sauce and cheese with pepperoni with less used ingredients of blue cheese and raw garlic. Crust had a perfect chewiness. Very good.

There beer selection was ok-really would have preferred a draft selection but they did have great selection of local bottled beers.

All in all a nice meal"}
{"text":"Seemed kinda Hipster-ish. Very cute and quaint. Tables are very close together inside, not really personal...Food: Calamari was good, Pizza was blah, Soggy and burnt, wasn't impressed. Crepe with fruit was delicious. Service was mediocre, I understand you are busy but at least talk to your customers."}
{"text":"Wow, was this restaurant was delish.  I am not a huge Italian food fan but I was VERY impressed with the quality of this restaurant.   I tried my son's homemade pasta and it was unbelievable.  I've never had homemade pasta but once I tried it I knew it was homemade.  I love that the portions weren't HUGE (which is one of the reasons why I don't like going to Italian restaurants--they put way too much food on the plate including something as filling as pasta).  It was just the right amount for an adult.  The pizza was delicious.  Again, even on the pizza, everything tasted super fresh and homemade.  The only thing that I didn't love was the marinated veggies.  It was a bit too tart.  I'm not knocking the restaurant because I figured that it was just my own issue with a dish that is a traditional starter.  

The other thing that I didn't care for (which has nothing to do with the food at the restaurant) was the route that my family (hubby and two boys) took to get there.  We walked there from our hotel in downtown Phoenix.  Not sure that was a great idea, looking back.  Lots of homeless people wandering the streets and the main street that the restaurant sits on has some low-income housing that was a little scary looking.  Also, having that fraternity house right across the restaurant with these rowdy frat boys screaming things at the patrons as they walked into the restaurant wasn't ideal.  But the food was yummy.  I'd go back.  But I'd take a cab next time.  :)  

Absolutely worth it to check it out."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place in Phoenix, hands down. Also my go to place for any kind of celebration due to the relaxing ambiance. Their food is so delicious and fresh and the customer service is great, so really, what more could you want? Definitely try their house made limoncello, super tasty and unique. Don't get my started on their desserts! My only advice to you is to not wear your skinny jeans unless you are willing to pop a button in the restaurant, since you will be eating your weight in pizza and crepes."}
{"text":"Flies for lunch.

Mosquitoes for dinner.

If you want flies landing on your food or if you want to be bit by mosquitoes while you eat, then I highly recommend you visit Cibo.



...also, the service royally sucks.  They will change servers on you in the middle of your meal."}
{"text":"To start off, were from Cali so going to a 4.5 star place, I def expected a lot more. The place seemed really cool but the food & the brew were ok. I felt like it doesn't justify its stars. It's safe to say, Yelp kinda let me down on this one. The potential is there but they need to step their selection of brews (more craft beers please) and the pizza needs better taste. All in all, I would try another pizza spot if you're from outta town, L.A. area to be exact."}
{"text":"My mother-in-law took us here when our friend from Japan was visiting. I would definitely go back! The service was excellent, and the food was, of course, delicious! We had a cheese platter, two pizzas (I don't remember what kind, but they were good!), and awesome drinks. Our server was friendly, had great suggestions, and was very patient with us. Oh, and the atmosphere was great -- very warm and inviting. Overall, we were very satisfied."}
{"text":"Was looking for a cute date night, and this was the perfect spot! The wait was fairly short for a Saturday night and the ambience was very romantic! I wanted to order a pizza but couldn't decide between the Funghi and the Da Vinci. The waitresses let me know you can you do half/half which is just what I ordered. I highly recommend the Da Vinci! My bf got the Genova, a pesto pizza, which he really liked! Also recommend the spicy oil as a nice dipping sauce! I will definitely be back to try the other menu options!"}
{"text":"This place is my go-to spot when I'm in Phoenix. It has character, good food and fine wine selection. What more do you need?
Pizzas are absolutely fantastic; had a few.  Burrata is also great, so highly recommend it.  Salads and pastas are good, too.  I mean, you just can't go wrong with this place. It's yum!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I found Cibo while visiting Phoenix! My co-worker and I went on a Wednesday evening around 6 and had no wait/crowd. I love that their happy hour runs until 7. We had wine and the meatballs (fabulous!). Then had dessert before dinner with the fried dough balls that we dipped in Nutella. Loved it! For dinner we shared the Prosciutto pizza and the Diavalo pizza and both were fantastic! It's is cute little rustic place with a beautiful patio. It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I've heard everyone talk about this place over and over, so we decided to give it a try. It was THE BEST pizza I've ever had. We ordered the white truffle pizza which was to die for! It didn't take super long to cook, and our waitress was very attentive. We had gone to Humble Pie the week before to try pizza and were not impressed, so we're happy to now have a spot where we live that we LOVE. The atmosphere is so cute and intimate with the dim lighting. Perfect date spot. And you HAVE to save room for the dessert crepes!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love the Diavlo Pizza at Cibo. It's so pretty on the patio and the food, music and atmosphere are romantic and amazing. Cibo is a \"must\" when you're in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Meh. Barely attended to by our server, white pizza with sausage and potatoes dry and not eaten by my meat-loving pizza-devouring teenagers, and red-sauce pizza not crisp under center and soggy. This is not adequate neopolitan pizza. There is acreason  Bianco is so highly rated, and now Pomo in area much better. Was pretty disappointed, especially given the hype. Won't be back."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've eaten pizza here, which I used to love, but the last couple of times I ordered, it was kind of soggy. Yuck.

However, came in for lunch and ordered the Cous Cous salad with chicken. It was very tasty and filling! I also love that they serve you soda in the can. I don't know why, but it is so refreshing.

I would like to return soon to try the pizza again as well as some of the homemade pastas!"}
{"text":"I just love this place! Great location and amazing atmosphere. The restaurant sits on a beautiful plot of land with lush trees and twinkling lights. Most nights they have live music outside that just enhances your experiences. We arrived in time for happy hour and ordered arancini (deep fried arborio rice with a center of mozzarella) and meatballs with crusty bread. The meatballs were very good and my fiance really enjoyed the arancini. For dinner we ordered the Diavola which comes with a lovely spicy salame. The pizza here is truly authentic to Italy and is not overly sauced, cheesed, or garnished. I love the simple and tasty flavors and wood fired pizza. Same room for dessert, the nutella and marscapone crepe is just about the most amazing thing you have ever had. Reasonable prices and good happy hour selection. Great for a group (you will want to share one of their amazing anitpasti boards) One of my favorite places for italian in Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"I truly wish there was a 3.5 option, as that reflects a more accurate rating of my experience. 

For starters, the food was good. Some of the best italian I've had around the city. Our group ordered mussels to start with and they were absolutely delicious. For my entree I had the chicken piccata and it was 100% amazing. I finished every last bite and quite honestly could have gone for a second piece of it. 

One of my friends ordered the bolognese and we were informed that the restaurant was out of it. Weird, because it was mid-service on a Saturday evening. We came to a compromise where the chef would simply make the sauce out of chopped up meatballs and my friend raved about it, saying it was delicious. 

Another dining companion got the special, which was a pepper-encrusted pork loin sort of dish with veggies on the side. Though the pork was cooked well, the rub was comprised of WHOLE PEPPERCORNS. Sort of a dick move not to grind them up, as my friend was sweating bullets and didn't finish it (and it was his birthday!). I tasted a small piece and the pepper was 100% overwhelming and didnt really do much to enhance the flavor of the meat. Luckily the place had a creme brulee saved for him to make up for the gross meat dish.

As the previous reviewer reemed everyone out for complaining about the $7 corkage fee because we don't own restaurants and therefore couldn't POSSIBLY be able to understand how pricing works, I'll refrain from repeating other's sentiments.

Two major problems for me in this place was the ridiculously cramped atmosphere of the place. I was literally sitting chair to chair with a person behind me and had her conversation in my ear the entire evening. Also, though the food for the most part was good, the prices are still a bit high for Pittsburgh. 


Would come back here on a very special occasion."}
{"text":"Nice outdoor seating and a quieter dining experience. Very noisy inside but cooler in the summer. The food was good but you cannot have a conversation with anyone. Service is a bit slow."}
{"text":"Pizzas, crepes ,live music, and great weather ,what more can you ask for!? maybe a little extra nutella in the crepe teeheee but other than that this place is a gem! :D"}
{"text":"Pizza... delicious.  Absolutely delicious.
Cool factor... check.  Awesome ambiance... old house... excellent outside seating
Service... great!  

Cibo has my favorite pizza in PHX.  Everything I've ever had there has been great.  I highly recommend checking them out."}
{"text":"Good chewy pizza al fresco out on the patio. A nice neighborhood vibe going on with friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Fresh food, good wine, and a beautiful outdoor setting - what more can a girl ask for? We came here for lunch and got the meatballs, margherita pizza, and eggplant parm sandwich. Everything was delicious and the outdoor seating was adorable. Would definitely come back, time and again."}
{"text":"This place is happening.

Sure, it can be a bit loud but I really dig the hustle and bustle of this place.  Best of all, the dishes are perfect for sharing!

Went there with a friend of mine, and we ordered some appetizers (Scodellina?), a pasta dish and a pizza, which was more than enough for the two of us to share.

We had the cavatappi (chicken, prosciutto, arugula) which was amazing - highly reco.

The wild boar bacon pizza, on the other hand, was just all right. The crust was delicious though and tasted even better the morning after.

Will be back."}
{"text":"Originally we had another pizza spot picked but a change in plans put us here.   Cute atmosphere, quaint little restaurant in a converted local house.   Friendly staff, nice outside seating and decorations.  

Food wise pretty good.   We started with the fried calamari.  It was tasty except it comes with a homemade like sauce and not marinara.  Overall a bit spicy but not ghost chili hot.  Then got 2 pizzas, the prosciutto and then an artichoke with olive and ham.   Tasty, crust had some nice burned/charred flavor, pizza cooked well.  Enjoyed it overall and if in the area we'd return but wouldn't go out of our way."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place, and I definitely get what all the fuss is about!

I really like the atmosphere at Cibo. I was gonna say it's a \"cute little place\" because that's how it feels, but I think it's a lot bigger than it actually appears (as I was leaving I noticed that the patio really does have a lot of seating). It seems like there's a lot of separate little rooms each with a few tables, which I kind of like because even though this place gets busy you still can carry on a conversation with your party without feeling like you have to shout over loud noise. 

As for food, I can honestly say the calzone I had was one of (if not THE) best I ever had. I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to calzones, but the one at Cibo isn't quite as \"heavy\" compared to most places (the crust surrounding the cheese & meats is thinner), but it's HUGE & very filling. The lighter crust (& cheese) doesn't make you feel like there's a huge rock in your gut when you're finished even thought you just finished something so mammoth (and yes, I did finish my calzone). The other people I was with all had pizzas & they all found them to be yummy. I should note (and I'm pointing out my own stupidity here), the calzone at Cibo is listed on the menu w/the pizzas (they only have one calzone listed). The pizzas at Cibo all have special Italian sounding names. I actually thought I was ordering a pizza called the \"calzone\" and planned on sharing it w/the others in my party who were all sharing pizzas. I was a little surprised when I got an ACTUAL calzone (I know, silly me). Anyway, my friends had more than enough pizza to share with each other and I ate the whole calzone myself!

My friends ordered a couple of desserts, which I didn't plan on trying, but decided when in Rome, why not! I had a couple of the donut ball things dipped in nutella (sorry, don't know what they're actually called), and they were heaven. A couple other friends split whatever the crepe w/fresh fruit & whipped cream is called, and well, I probably ate at least half of it. So, yeah...

The service at Cibo is a little slow, but it gets crowded so that's understandable (I was here on a Friday). Our server was very friendly & helpful, though. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"SoOoO AMAZING!!! Great Bruschetta pizza, also tried some of the Arizona Hefewizen really good beer! The waiter we had also made it very welcoming super nice guy!"}
{"text":"This place is so darn cute!! The patio area is super romantic! Friend and I sat in the patio for dinner but then it randomly started to rain so we moved inside. I guess this place used to be a house and you can tell by the layout and the inside is just as cute as their patio. Highly recommend this as a date spot.

We ordered the pear salad, which was surprisingly good...I don't usually like arugula. Very tasty indeed! I was disappointed by the pear in the salad. If you are going to have a pear salad you should try to ensure that the pear is ripe and that it actually tastes like a pear. We also shared the vegetarian pizza which was also good. Something about the crust or the sauce or the cheese it just had a distinct flavor. It was a bit weird that the pizza was separated by the veggies i.e. one slice of red pepper, one slice of zucchini. I would have preferred for the veggies to be cut into smaller pieces and sprinkled throughout the pizza. Random? The italian beer was refreshing and lite...perfect for a hot summer night. I would definitely come back to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"My new favorite place in Downtown Phoenix!!!! Late night dinner we decided to check this place out and OMG I'm so glad we did! The server a pretty blonde was extra helpful and on point! (Too bad I didn't get her name) she answered all our questions and advised us on some items! I just completely fell in love! The place itself is a cute looking house, you walk and are greeted immediately, the wait wasn't long for a Thursday night... I'd so come again very very soon! 

We ordered the Arancini as an appetizer and I'm so craving it right now! It's a must try!!!

The pizza was delicious and the desert was to die for!"}
{"text":"Pizza looks amazing and tastes ok. Not quite cooked enough. Crust is a bit doughy. The slice flops over. Soggy pizza isn't my thing nor do i like to eat my slice with a fork and knife. Fresh and large basil on top is a plus. Cheese is fresh and great tasting. Service is pretty mediocre. Hostesses and servers seem distracted and not very attentive. Wouldn't return. And the ABC PHX pizza ranking is dead wrong. This is not the #1 pizza in PHX. That's still Bianco for me."}
{"text":"Cibo means \"food\" in Italian. It doesn't get any more obvious than that on what they offer here! We actually got dessert first nearby, and figured we should be adults and also get dinner. Cibo was recommend by my friend who we were with so we headed over to try out their Italian cuisine. 

They offer valet parking at Cibo (Can't remember if it's complimentary or not), but there is also street parking available. We got here early (Maybe around 5:30-6) and were able to find a spot nearby. When we left around 7 though there was a lot of traffic and parking spots were a rare commodity. 

The patio looks very picturesque, but there was someone smoking like a chimney outside and I'm sensitive to cigarette smoke so I decided on dining inside. We got a table with a view of the patio near the window. 

Since we got here during happy hour (Discounted drinks and appetizers), we decided to split the happy hour arancini. It came in a basket of 4 with marinara sauce. The arancini were golf ball sized, and were fried to crispy perfection on the outside. The inside was very plain, just risotto rice, but the rice was nicely cooked. I was a little disappointed there wasn't any filling in it (The menu says there's mozzarella in the center but I didn't really see any), and for me the taste was a little bland and the texture monotonous. For the size of the rice balls I would have liked an additional hit of texture in the filling. 

For our meal I had the cacio e pepe and had a slice of the vegetariana pizza. I've never had cacio e pepe so I was excited to try it out (Plus it gave me a chance to say \"cacio e pepe!\" in an exaggerated fake Italian accent at the table). When our dishes came out they looked amazing. I tried the pizza first. The vegetariana has various vegetables and each one is layered on a different part of the pizza which I thought was a unique touch. It was like you were eating a different pizza depending on which part of it you took a slice from. The vegetables were fresh and the pizza itself was decent. The type of pizza they make here leans more towards a Neapolitan style crust which is thin and can be hard to pick up. You might need a fork and knife to eat this pizza depending on your dexterity level. I personally don't really like \"floppy\" pizzas so it was just OK for me. (By the way this isn't to be confused with NY style pizza which has larger slices, is thin yet foldable and you are able to pick it up)

The cacio e pepe was well prepared, but for me I didn't really enjoy it. The pasta was perfectly al dente, and it had a good amount of fresh cracked pepper in it with butter and cheese. I can see what this dish tries to aim for, by contrasting the spicy black pepper with the delicate flavors of the butter and strong flavor of the cheese, but for me the dish fell flat. For me it tasted mainly like I was eating peppery plain pasta with a hint of cheese. It needed some more flavor for me. I did get a very generous portion of the pasta though which I ended up taking home. 

Service was friendly and sweet. The other thing to note about my experience was that we were at a table that was slightly wobbly which made it a slight annoyance when we were eating. 

It was overall a decent experience food-wise. The ambiance is nice but I'll go to a place for their food over how the restaurant looks. I might try them out again and get something different to see if another menu item strikes my fancy."}
{"text":"The best restaurant I've ever been too! It exceeded any expectations I've ever had when looking for a place to eat. We got to sit outside by a little waterfall at night surrounded by beautiful trees, a real lit candle on our table, white lights decorating the trees, and it was about 70 degrees outside. It couldn't have been better! Plus of course the food and espresso was the best I've ever had and the service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I had my engagement night dinner here so it will always have a special place in my heart. The patio is the highlight of the restaurant. Not a big fan of the indoor seating because it is pretty cramped. I would have sat outside but it was a July night we went here so it was hot not to mention I was in a full suit after proposing.  Parking was a bitch. The food is really good. Their pizza is very delicious. Our server was very nice and accommodating.  Not a big fan of giving me a soda in a can and still charging me $3 per can lol. I don't know why some places do that. This isn't Mexico. Get a damn fountain.  I would go back."}
{"text":"We ate at Cibo last night for the first time. The overall experience was less than satisfying to OK. 

The atmosphere was pretty good. It was a little loud but overall it is a great space.

The food went from excellent to mediocre to confusing. 

We ordered a Cibo bread with oil and vinegar to start. Excellent and refreshing. We were excited what was to come next. 

Next we ordered the Prosciutto and Bresaola Lobster Aioli. These were ok. Refreshing but the lobster aioli was almost non-existent and adding very little to the over plate. Which was a disappointment as were looking forward to trying it. 

Our final dishes were Romain salad with a flat iron steak and a Squash salad. The Romain salad was drown in parmesan cheese and anchovies were slimy and unappealing. The steak was less than satisfying. I couldn't figure out the spices, it had weird after tasted and it was under cooked. While the squash salad was bland and tasteless and in my wife's words \"confusing.\"

They had an excellent selection of wines and select Calgary beers. The service was decent. 

Over all this was mediocre experience at a costly price."}
{"text":"This is a great place! Delicious food, friendly staff and amazing atmosphere. Great for groups! The specials are so good offering best value on 17th."}
{"text":"Excellent wood fired pizza and the bartender was very attentive and helpful. Great place."}
{"text":"Went Friday around 7:00. 5-10 minute wait. Good hefeweizen. Great Antipasto salad. Pizza was good, the small burnt parts were nice actually. The best was the Fresca desert - a crepe, stuffed with vanilla ice cream and fresh fruit, then topped with more fresh fruit and whipped cream. Wow."}
{"text":"This pizza is fantastic, probably my favorite in Phoenix, though that's very hard to name. I also love the location, both inside and outside is fantastic.  The whole menu is fantastic. It's a great place for a date-night, or to bring friends visiting town, or to go with a small party, if you can either make reservations for a large group or wait it out.  Everyone must check this place out at least once!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! As good as any pizza you will get anywhere in town. Cute old house with an inviting patio when it cools off. Had a wonderful meatball sandwich at lunch (they only do pizza at night). They have delicious crepes for desert.  If you want a great meal go to Cibo."}
{"text":"This place is the cutest date place. The patio is fun and romantic with cute lights and grape leaves growing around. The burrata salad is a must have. We ordered 2 pizzas- one margharita and one white pizza. Both were so tasty but we leaned towards the margharita as the winner. The italian wine we ordered was a hit and tasty as well. Our waitress recommended it and I wish I had remembered what kind it was. Seems that the staff sure know their stuff! 

Beware of mosquitos on the patio though!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food! I went here on a date and we got the burrata appetizer and a pizza. They were both amazing... especially the burrata!!. Go on a cool summer night and sit outside."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place on 17th that you must visit if you're in the area. I made a reservation here for my birthday and had an absolutely wonderful time. To start on Wednesday's they have $5 glasses of wine... you really can't go wrong with that. The three of us then split a trio of dips including an eggplant dip which was fantastic! For our main course we shared a pizza and a pasta dish between the three of us and both were excellent - we even had a little eft over! 

To wrap things up we ordered both desserts available because it was my birthday and you only live once. Anyways, again really amazing! Service was great, ambience was wonderful. Cibo definitely has character, and is arguably one of the trendiest places on 17th when it come to dining-out! 

I really loved Cibo and I'll definitely be back here - especially since they hae swordfish but there was none available that day!"}
{"text":"LOVE Cibo. Ambiance and amazing food :)"}
{"text":"LOVED IT!! Probably the best meatball I have ever had! 

Great atmosphere and their pizza is one point! 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Caution flying bugs! 
Server was good and the food was good, I do wish I tried something more adventurous but my date wanted pizza. 

My biggest problem was we're the bugs!!!!!!!!!!!
Because of the heaters bugs were attracted to a warmer environment and eventually they were on my food, in my hair and on my last nerves! 

Management: if you insist on having heaters in a leafy area consider investing in some bug zappers.
I might come back, maybe at a time in the year they don't need space heaters"}
{"text":"A staple of my restaurant diet. This place can do no wrong.

If you want true italian style food, go here (get there early during lunch as there's a rush)."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the following reasons.
   When I called to make reservations 10 days before wishing to dine there, the man told me that they don't usually take reservations for parties of five, \"but that he'd see what he could do.\"  He had a vaguely condescending tone.  Then when I had the nerve to ask him if we could be on the patio, he kind of laughed and said, \"the patio fills up quickly but again, I'll see what I can do.\"  Seeing as though I made the reservation 10 days in advance, I'd think the patio wouldn't be booked up that far out....but maybe I'm mistaken.  

  When we got there the night we dined, it was a perfect night and the patio was beautiful with twinkly lights on all the trees.  When we gave our names for our 7:30 reservations, the owners,( I'm assuming they're the owners, they seemed to be a couple) seemed very stressed out and told us they would seat us as soon as possible.....and we waited....and we waited.  I was the designated driver so I ordered a club soda with lime, but this establishment only has $6 bottles of Italian sparkling water, which certainly added up throughout the evening.  We had cocktails as we stood on the ramp leading from the restaurant to the patio, being jostled about by waiters and patrons frequently.  My brother asked me if I knew what the word \"Cibo\" meant.  I said I did not.  Then he said with a sly grin, \"It means SLOW.\"  Finally, after waiting about 40 mins., we were seated.

  We seemed to have 3 or 4 waiters.  It didn't really affect the experience too much except that we didn't know who to ask for what.  People kept coming up and asking us things we had already told the last waiter who'd visited us......strange.  The only other issue I have is the napkins are paper.  When you are eating pizza at a kinda fancy joint,  it is my belief you should have cloth napkins.  But again, maybe I'm being picky.

  The food, however, was absolutely wonderful.  We ordered an antipasto plate which was great,  a salad with chick pea dressing, awesome croutons, Pecorino Romano and parsnips.  Out of this world!  Our second salad had pears, honey, more romano cheese, and roasted almonds tossed in balsamic vinaigrette.
  My dad, the pasta freak, ordered a simple thick spaghetti-like pasta, fresh and not available every day.  It had browned butter and black pepper and herbs on it.  He was very happy.    The rest of us split 2 pizzas.  The simple Margherita, just sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil.  (They forgot to put the basil on the pizza however and had to bring us a cup full).  The other pizza was the Tartufata, a white pizza with prosciutto, mozzarella, mushrooms and drizzled with truffle oil.  We fought over the the last piece!  

  Seeing as it was my sister in law's birthday, they brought a crepe filled with chocolate which tasted like a big chocolate chip cookie.  I've never been that big of a fan of the crepe but everyone took a few bites.  There was also a jazz trio playing on the patio and even though they were a bit loud at times, we were not seated close to them and they did a version of a Radiohead song which I appreciated.

  So, a bit of a pain in the ass logistically and service wise.  (They do have valet parking)  But the food is absolutely awesome.  If they would just get some club soda and those cloth napkins....."}
{"text":"Surprised I never wrote a review for Cibo but to be well fed with dessert and a bottle of wine for under $60 bucks you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"We went there several times in the past including lunch and dinner. The sandwich for lunch is great, but the pizza and desserts for dinner is my favorite!! Romantic atmosphere, great for couple and family. Definitely the best pizza I ever had in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We went to Cibo for the first time with a group before the Lady Gaga concert.  It was my first time and I was very curious since I hadn't realized it until we went there that this had been suggested by another friend a few weeks earlier.  Cibo is just west of Central Ave and very close to ASU Downtown and the Light Rail. 
Phoenix loves their \"Housetaurants\" Former houses turned restaurant. For this place, it works.  Walking up, the entire \"front yard\" is the patio seating.   Very cute setting lined with table umbrellas.  The lighting was enough to be comfortable in the setting and made it cozy.   It was charming.  If our friends had not been their before us, I would have suggested we sit outside.  It was super cute.  
We get in and we were seated in the back, a little pocket in the back of a long room.  I guess it was becuase of the size of our group.  
After looking over the menu, most of us decided to go with individual pizzas.  I got the Margarita pizza.  When i got it, it was delish!  It was pretty large for an individual so you might be taking some home.  We also got the Ostia Salad.  Wonderful flavors and the sharpness of the cheese shaved on it was a great start to the meal. 
One thing that was slightly off was the service.  When we got there, it was pretty empty and we were one of 2 tables in that section.  Our waitress, while knowledgeable of the items, always seemed like she was in a rush and really didn't give us the time.  My friend asked her a question and then when she took a second to make her decision she said \"Ok, well I'm going to have to come back to you, and went on to taking the rest of our orders.  It was kind of the tone and the fact she seemed rushed.  She also didn't visit the table as much as she should in my oppinon, especially since we were stuck in the back corner.  Then at the end of the meal, we saw why.  18% auto gratuity.  It never fails big group, poor service.  It wasn't bad enough to not go back, and like I said she was knowledgeable of the menu, but her overall attitude seemed like we were an inconvenience to her. Maybe she was missing the concert because she had to work? :)   Oh well, no big deal, we would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"the arugula pear salad was as bland as the Valpolicella and La Noce pie. the ambiance on a cool April evening was a delight. the dining experience was saved by the 25% donation of our bill to Dining Out For Life."}
{"text":"Great little Italian place close to the centre of Phoenix.

I've been here a few times now and had a good experience every time. The food is fresh and the wine selection is great!

Perfect spot for a date night or a lunch out with friends or family!"}
{"text":"Awesome patio and food good such a cute place. They have good service and great pizza! I've never tried anything but the pizza so I can't speak but booo the pizza"}
{"text":"I love Cibo for the atmosphere, the food and the CREPES!  I haven't made it to Pizzeria Bianco yet, however Cibo is pretty impressive in itself.  It's location gives it history and warmth.  I get that comfy feeling like I'm over for dinner at a friend's house.  

For an appetizer, the antipasto speciale is very popular.  The salsicca and the margherita pizza are my favorites here.  I know everyone always questions the crust when reviewing a pizza.  Well, it's not a gourmet crust like Pizzeria Mozza in LA.  It's probably the closest thing I've had to pizza I've found in Rome.  Not too thin crust, slightly crispy and slightly chewy, minimal toppings & a great sauce.  The fresca or the Nutella and banana  crepes complete a great meal!"}
{"text":"Bummed about the long wait for dinner but understandable given the size of the place.  The pizza and Nutella crepes were worth the wait though. Looking forward to going back again soon."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the wood-fired pizza, and when I saw they had a vegetarian pizza I ordered that in a heartbeat. The pizza came with zucchini, mushroom, roasted red pepper, and artichoke. When the pizza came, it was strange because each slice only consisted of the one topping, it was not distributed throughout the full pizza. Having a slice of pizza with one thin slice of zucchini on it was not what I expected. As we were down to the last coupe of slices, we also noticed there was a long black hair on it - really gross. This place has a cute and cozy atmosphere, but I probably would not go back. Maybe if I ordered something else it would have been better, but overall I was very disappointed with my meal."}
{"text":"Wow! My friends had been raving about this place for over a year so had to check it out on my recent visit. The pizzas are super thin crust which is just how I like it. I definitely recommend the spicy pepperoni pie, but they had so many options to choose from that you really can't go wrong. Cibo is an old house right in the heart of Phoenix, so the place has tons of charm if you are looking for a great date spot. I thought the service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. All the ingredients  are fresh and the food is truly authentic southern Italian!"}
{"text":"I came, I had a mojito, I left. But it was grand. The patio at Cibo is a delightful seclusion from the hubbub and passersby on 17th Ave. It's got a super tall fence made from old wood slats. It feels like it's always been there.

I caught the tail end of a going away party, but our server, Ashley noticed the new addition to the party right away and grabbed my drink order. She was back lickety-split with my mojito. 

I didn't have any room for food this time round having just finished dinner elsewhere, but the list of pizzas look mighty fine (I want to try the pear pizza!).

Cibo's patio and drink service gets an A in my books."}
{"text":"I struggled between three and four stars.  I gave the 4th star for effort.   Service was fantastic and very welcoming.   The food was good but there was plenty of room for improvement.   I had the Lamb Shank at 27.00 which was very flavorful but slightly overdone.   The accompanying risotto was delicious but was somewhat overwhelmed by tomato sauce which was bitter.    Orange cake for dessert which was flavorful but dry.   The server immediately corrected by bringing me a very tasty Affogato.    Overall, I will go back in the near future and will recommend to other neighbors in the area.    My portion was perfect.    The pasta dishes were pleasing to my fellow diners......though the portions were not overgenerous."}
{"text":"loved the food, location, and look of the place...they have the same style of pizza that the pizzeria in Heritage Square does...only your not sitting on top of strangers.
Wait staff runs Hot and Cold...some nights we had a waitress/waiter that seemed to be having a wonderful time with their guests...other nights the waiter/waitress and the \"water re-filler\" seem to be very unhappy we were there. Food makes up for it in my book and you just \"rasberry\" them off until you get your pizza. thats what Tipping is for"}
{"text":"Love! 

Cibo is a place I have been wanting to go to for ages, and after getting lost and missing an event downtown, I decided to treat myself to dinner here. It was a nice night and the patio was poppin', but I decided to sit inside. I had their dessert blossom tea and decided on the diavola pizza. It was really good, one of the top pizzas I've had. I was in a rush but decided to get the banana nutella crepe which was a delicious mistake. Service was good. There was a mistake on my bill but the staff worked to quickly fix it. No doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"For our anniversary dinner, my boyfriend and I couldn't ask for more than this exquisitely styled, unbelievably delicious restaurant. The pizza was wood-fired, flavorful, and downright gorgeous, and getting to sit all night on their light-studded patio was a dream. The real kicker, though? Mozzerella, the enormous white cat who casually prowls the property, making friends, taking naps, and maybe getting to nibble a calzone or two. He sat on my lap all through dinner, moving to my boyfriend's for dessert. For cats and pizza, I couldn't recommend a better place."}
{"text":"Ambiance outside is excellent, with live music playing tonight! The inside isn't as charming, but comfy and a good volume to hold a conversation. The free valet service is super convenient, as parking is tough in the neighborhood on busy nights.

We loved the burrata appetizer, with the prosciutto and toasted bread! Pizza was also delicious, although we didn't love the balsamic onion topping. One person in our party ordered the pappardelle and it was definitely homemade. Very good quality food!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a business lunch. Fast service and parking is easy because of the great staff at the valet. Food was good and the menu had something to offer everyone that attended the lunch."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! The outside patio is so pretty at night too. There are lights and pretty vines everywhere. We got the Diablo pizza and the calamari and it was so yummy. I have already recommended it to my family and I will definitely be going back again soon."}
{"text":"I love the building and the ambience of the restaurant.  A great place for a business lunch.  We did arrive early to get a table for six.  The staff was friendly and helpful when looking at the menu.  Some coworkers ordered the couscous salad, I had the pastrami and onions hot sandwich. Really good.  Lots of meat, cheese and onions.  I will need to come back and try the pizzas and salads.  Price is decent and our glasses were always full."}
{"text":"Great vibes and excellent food!!! If you order the Veggie pizza, pay extra to mix Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Charming, great food. Lovely outdoor seating. Can get too crowded at times, but a wonderful place for a date, business meeting or a night out with friends."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants for gourmet pizza in Arizona. Great place to go before going to a show at The Vanburen which also is awesome. Outside seating is amazing and the attention to quality is top notch."}
{"text":"Excellent food and staff.  Food is fresh, can take a little time, but well worth the wait. Good wine list with some descent options."}
{"text":"The best word to describe Cibo would be \"pleasant.\" From the staff and the environment to the wine, pizza, & crepes- it was sweet and warm. Also, it was reasonably priced for such a classy setting. Love love love!"}
{"text":"Better than Pizzeria Bianco...NUF SAID!!! 

Seriously, this is one of my favorite places to dine in the valley, phoenix, arizona, um...anywhere for that matter. I've had some of the best pizza there is, from new york to chicago, italy and back. Cibo is my favorite. The service is always spot-on. The wine list smart, the appetizers tasty, salads luscious, deserts to die for, the location is adorable and of course the pizza is perfect! This place has palpable charm and the ambiance whether its quiet or busy is somehow always what you hoped for. Just writing this is making me change my plans for dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"It was pretty crowded on the Sunday night I visited and I was alone (in town on business) so I sat at the bar.  I wouldn't recommend doing that, the press of people was far too claustrophobic.  

The food was outstanding.  I am still thinking longingly of the Tricolore pizza two weeks later.  The crust was perfect, chewy and light and tasty and the toppings and seasoning was just incredible.  I can't wait to go back with my colleagues next week.  But we'll be getting a table this time!"}
{"text":"Recently our party of 3 went for a special occasion. The guest of honor was moving out of town and had had so many good experiences at Cibo they wanted their last meal in Phoenix to be at this spot that has been the source of so many good memories over the years.

What a disappointment. The server (male/floppy haired/'stoner' look/attitude, who's been there for years) ruined the night. 25 min after dinner was finished and NO contact. And none during the actual meal. Empty drink glasses, un-taken dessert/coffee orders, etc.

This guy needs to go."}
{"text":"This restaurant has wonderful pizza, but what is better is their cheese plates!  They have wonderful combinations of cheese (generous portions too) bread (fresh baked of course), honey, jam or chutney, fruit and nuts.  The wines are good and very reasonably priced.  Great atmosphere and service this is a place I often recommend to my friends!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in AZ. Tatufatta is bomb and so is the one with pear and goat cheese?  I think that's what it was. Anyway, if you're there and they have fresh pasta, get down on that. Also their crepes are dank af and you need that in your life. Stop reading this and go get fat at Cibo"}
{"text":"Great little spot in Phoenix for lunch. I was in town and grabbed a quick lunch with a friend. The patio is shaded and is oriented beautifully. (It compliments well with great weather) They have a great selection of draft beer and their bread here is amazing. The bread is made to order and made in house. (both of which impressed me) Pizza was a little soggy and wet for my preference but otherwise tasted great. Servers were very nice and attentive. Wouldn't mind coming here again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Cibo as soon as we walked up to it. The outdoor patios are lovely and such a nice setting. We went Sunday during brunch time and I was a little worried that they wouldn't have their pizza as I read a few reviews (old ones) that said that they didn't serve PIzza. For the record, they do.

We ordered their margherita pizza and M&M. The margherita pizza was OK, nothing too special. It was also a little salty in my opinion. I was kind of hoping for some freshly grated parmesan too instead of the powdered kind. The M&M was good though, but not something I would go out of my way to get."}
{"text":"Great bread! I've pretty much tried it all and I love it! Its so cute at night when they turn their lights on! Its like a little picnic under the stars!"}
{"text":"The pizzas here are excellent. It's REAL pizza and what you should expect a pizza to taste like. I hosted my fiance's birthday here last year and we all had a good time. Love the outdoor seating and the decor. One complaint is that a homeless person wandered into the outdoor seating area and the waitstaff let her hang around for an HOUR! They gave her water and she sat down by the fire and they never asked her to leave. It was really awkward and uncomfortable and the guests at the birthday party were weirded out, as was I. Still giving Cibo 5 stars because the food was impeccable nonetheless."}
{"text":"My Hubby and I were staying at the Palomar Hotel. We Yelped a pizza place that had Gluten free pizza and decided to try Cibo since it was within walking distance. 
We had the Rustica pizza with no cheese and added sausage. 
It was the BEST gluten free pizza I've ever had!!!!!!  We finished the whole pizza and had a salad. 
We will definitely be back when in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Amazing place! 
Went on a Saturday night and sat right away, great environment. Service was EXCELLENT!! 
The food was to die for. We had pizzas and the pasta of the day which was the rigatoni with vodka sauce and sausage. There was no complaints. To top it off we got the Nutella and banana crepe for the table and it was a success... will definitely come back and it's on my list for the best restaurants in town !!!!!!!'n"}
{"text":"There isn't a better place to take a date in Phoenix.  The owners are always present and welcome guests as old friends.  The patio is absolutely gorgeous and has live music on the weekends.  The inside is a bit cramped, but is bursting with ambiance - low lights, gorgeous wood bar, local art.

And the food... Skip the wait at Pizzeria Bianco and come here instead.  Trust me on this one.  The pizza is delicious and you haven't lived until you've tried the Burrata.

Five stars."}
{"text":"Yay, finally made it back to Cibo for their happy hour! Ordered 2 $5 pizzas and dang the dough was just as good as I remembered! :) hehe.
That dough is sooooo yummy... crispy and chewy..... hmmmm!

The bacon salami pizza was yummy. Go Try the Pizza!

I also tried their Gnocchi another time and just to warn people, it's not your normal gnocchi... it literally is a potato dough dumpling, shaped almost like a gyoza! hehe."}
{"text":"Homemade pasta was way to salty. Good atmosphere. Nice to sit outside and listen to live jazz but the place is a little over rated in my opinion."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and great wine list, they are not pretentious and I have never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a table. 

Depending on where you sit the atmosphere can be cozy and romantic,  or lively for a night out with the girls. 

The staff is friendly and most times I can find a seat at the bar. 

4 cheers for Cibo!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here for my birthday last night. Last year we went to Pomo Pizzeria and I wanted to go to another gourmet pizzeria. One bite into my Rustica pizza and I nearly died. The crust...so thin and soft! The cheese...so meltyl! The proscuitto....so salty and perfect!! 6 of us split 2 pesto salads (delicious), and 3 pizzas: the Rustica, Salsiccia and Margherita. The Rustica was my favorite, followed by the Margherita then Salsiccia. The cheese was just so....authentic. The service was delightful. When we arrived, I told them we had 6 people, and I am obviously very pregnant, so the owner was incredibly polite in making sure I was comfortable with where we were sitting and I was cool enough and everything. My only disappointment was that I didn't get any acknowledgement that it was my birthday, but oh well. That's the worst of it. Overall, it was delightful...and I'm looking forward to having a leftover slice of pie right now!!"}
{"text":"We've been to Cibo twice, both on Saturday afternoons for late lunches after perusing galleries like the goddamned refined culture vultures we are. 

So yes, of course after 700+ reviews, you're going to know the product is amazing. It just IS. I've not yet subjected myself to the wait of Bianco but I can't imagine it's leaps and bounds better than Cibo. Cibo is dreamy.

First off: I want to plan a fantasy fairy wedding party in their front courtyard on a cool spring night. It's just so cute and perfect! The twinkle lights and the wrought iron and the fountains and everything is awesome. Too bad both times we've been there it was approx 48403 degrees out. Sometime soon.

Second off: The food is just sublime. What I've partaken in...

- Sardegna salad - \"baby spinach topped with goat cheese, carmelized walnuts, and sliced strawberries with prosecco dressing\" The salad was dressed lightly, the walnuts were plentiful, the strawberries were JUICEAAAAY! A perfect way to start a lunch (along with a glass of bubbly)

-Genova pizza - \"mozzarella, homemade basil pesto, roasted potatoes, white onions and grated parmigiano\" HELLO, YES, I LOVE YOU. I saw a few reviews wishing the potatoes were thinly sliced, rather than the small cubes, but it just seemed perfect to me. The gooey fresh mozz and pesto were the perfect blanket of taste under the potatoes and onion. The crust is wood-fired perfection

-Their take on the Margherita: Simple and classic. That's all there is to say. Mine had the perfect amount of basil and again, the charred underneath of the crust was on point.

So why 4 and not 5 stars if the food and ambiance seems so flawless? I just got the sense (on both visits) that the staff just didn't care to be there. I understand, late lunch is kind of annoying time to be working, especially on the weekends. But I mean...on our second trip our server came to our table chewing on a mouthful of food. What? Wait times just seem a LITTLE steep., especially with only one or two other tables occupied at both times. One time we got bread, one time we did not. I just wish things were a little more streamlined and a little more careful. I love places that let the staff be laid-back and casual...as long as their job is done. You know? 

In any case, it certainly won't stop us from visiting again. The food is too good to not! We'll make sure to make our next trip a dinner event in normal dinner times to see if things shape up just a few tiny notches in order to bump them up to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  Food is always good, ambiance is better (especially on the patio at night).  Prices are very fair."}
{"text":"They say Chris Bianco has the best Pizza in town. This place is better, but without the wait and cheaper bottles of wine. 

I finally became tired of waiting in the line at Bianco's Pizza for hours on end, and wound up at this amazing pizza joint. It's a restored 1913 bungalow on the corner of 5th Avenue and Fillmore with outdoor seating in the cozy front yard; it even has a fireplace to relax if there happens to be a short dinner rush. 

I have been coming here with friends for a few years now; it is consistently delectable artesian pizza. I believe the chef is from Naples. It is very close to most pizza joints in that region of Italy. Some of my favorites, in this order, are: the Rustica, Tricolore, and Capricciosa pizzas. The balsamic onions are great on some pizzas too for an additional charge. 

Hands down, the best thing and reason for coming here, is the Burrata appetizer. Average meal is around $17-25, add a $30 bottle of wine and split costs with friends.

{"text":"While in town for a quick trip we stopped in to Cibo.  Thanks to Yelp we went to this quaint little off \"off the beaten path\" pizzeria.  At first dear husband and I were a little sad that there was no pizza on the lunch menu but reading the sandwich descriptions and seeing some plates on other diner's tables, we figured it was fate. 

My Alla Parmigiana - fried eggplant sandwich - was wonderful!  The thin crispy wood fire oven baked saltimbucco bread held the eggplant, mozzarella, parmigiana, tomato sauce and basil.  The flavors were the perfect combination of all things Italian.  Every bite was wonderful.  The house salad was the perfect pairing for a great lunch.  And we hope to get back to try the pizza soon!"}
{"text":"I went here today and was surprised by how adorable the patio is! It's closed off from 17th in its own enclosed area. You're surrounded by a very old-timey blue wood fence and there are vines hanging off of everything. It's really beautiful and looks like a secret garden hideaway. If you're on 17th I highly recommend coming and sitting on their private patio. The crowd is great too 

Their wine half time specials are pretty decent too! We decided to have a few glasses of the house pinot grigio and I really enjoyed it. It's so nice to have a few cold glasses of wine on a +30C day! They also have Q water for guests which is awesome. 

Honourable mention goes to the upstairs bathroom for being adorable."}
{"text":"Fantastic location, ambiance, food, and beer selection.  I can't speak for the wine, but it looked good as well.  This place is definitely worth the visit, and you'll probably come back for the more traditionally prepared Italian pies with things like prosciutto and oil/pesto based sauces."}
{"text":"Not real sure what all the fuss is about this place...It is a restaurant which used to be a old house which was built in 1913....there are more tables outside then inside and it is located right on the corner of fillmore and 5th ave......we went there today for lunch only because we happen to be downtown, we would never drive a long way to eat here, not sure why anyone would....We ordered the hot veggie sandwich which tasted pretty good and it comes with fruit or a side salad, we opted for the fruit but be careful and know the fruit comes with vanilla yogurt and granola on top, for those who have nickel allergy ask for no pineapple and no granola which are both very high in nickel...Then we also ordered the white pizza...the thin light crust was the highlight of the pizza, it was very boring and a bit salty....it was nothing to write home about and there are many many other places in town who have amazing white pizza, this just is not it, it totally misses the mark....the pizza is limited during lunch only offering 4 different ones.....we tried the fresca crepe for dessert who is enough for three people, you will need a knife to eat it as the crepe sticks to the plate and it is hard to cut without a knife...I wish there was lots more fruit, it was okay it needed some kind of chocolate or other sauce as the crepe was a bit dry,,,,,,the wait staff was real nice, helpful and able to substitute other foods for my allergies with no added charge....they have hot green tea leaves and the beverages are only $2.00 or less for unlimited refills which is a good price....parking is limited in the back of the building with only about 9 spots but there is metered street parking.......the atmosphere is quaint and the seats inside and out are hard seats with no cushions....if you like atmosphere go , but I was very disappointed in the foods especially after so many people on yelp raved about the pizza, I guess they do not know good pizza, or the cook was having a bad day........"}
{"text":"Great food as I expected. Enjoyed the decor. Great for couples and an awesome patio. Service could have been a touch more attentive but as a team the service was good."}
{"text":"Wonderful, charming Italian eatery. The restaurant looks like a house and there is plentiful seating outside as well as indoors. We parked on the sidewalk on a metered spot but if your lucky enough to get a free parking spot do so! There is a small lot behind the restaurant. They were busy on a Sunday evening but service was great anyway. Our waitress helped us with our wine selection and we decided on the burrata and calamari appetizers.
- burrata app - delicious and recommended! Came with crunchy pieces of toast, burrata with balsamic vinegar, heirloom tomatoes with arugula and prosciutto.. can't go wrong with this one 
- calamari app -just ok.. not going to rave about this one
- calzone - the bread was soft and had char from the oven.. prosciutto coto, salame, mozzarella, ricotta filling was good too.. we also added mushrooms.. a solid choice
I loved the environment at Cibo. Would definitely dine here again if I came back to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I like this layout, many tables and rooms...we sat in the back carriage house, but the front area is much nicer, very Parisian like, small tables everywhere in a garden setting...very polite staff."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Phoenix. The pizza is wonderful, the pesto salad is absolutely amazing, and the fresh fruit crepe is delicious. They have a great patio and I've never had bad service here even on busy nights. The servers always remember my husband and me even though we don't go more than once every few months."}
{"text":"i have mixed feelings about this place. there were good and bad things that i saw for example the wine and beer list was pretty extensive and so was the choices of salads and appetizers. now as a person that has traveled all over Italy the Italian cuisine is quite extensive meaning you have a lot to choose from anything from pasta to seafood and everything in between. but here the only 2 things that seemed to be on the menu were pizzas and sandwiches. which in itself wasn't to bad but i just felt that their could have maybe been more options available on the menu because not everyone goes to an Italian restaurant for pizza or subs especially since those are considered lunch items so you might be dissapointed  if you are going there for dinner. but hey overall it wasn't to bad of an experience."}
{"text":"WOW. Better than I expected.

I thought I would never find a place with better pizza than Grimaldi's Pizza, but this place stole that #1 spot.

Hubby and I came here for lunch. We were seated promptly. Waited promptly. And got our food promptly. 

We ordered a pizza (you can choose two \"flavors\" so it's half and half) and the meatball sandwich with fruit salad. Everything was so delicious. Prices are reasonable. And this place is clean!

There is no pasta served during lunch. Only dinner. And there are more pizza options and dessert options during dinner. 

We want to go back already! I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars Nice place to have dinner outside. Excellent service. The highlight of the food for me was the Diavole pizza. Pizza overall is good. Our group didn't like the wine as much. In my opinion the dessert crepe with nutella and strawberries had too much nutella."}
{"text":"If I could give Cibo 10 stars I would!! Every time I've been here the food is amazing!! The Burrata is so tasty I could eat it daily. My other favorite is the pear salad! All of the pizza is mind blowing :)

This is a great location for dates or just grabbing a bite with friends. The patio is enchanting with all the lights and trees. The little house and patio transport you away from Phoenix and make you feel at home. 

If you have never been here, then you're making a huge mistake!!!!! Be prepared to wait though.. Depending on what day or time you go there could be a wait but its well worth it! The wait staff is pretty good too.. Ohh and if you want to avoid the wait you can order to-go and grab and drink at the bar while you wait."}
{"text":"I went for the first time to Cibo on the weekend for a mother's day brunch.  They actually don't have a brunch - but that was my mistake!!  Anyway, the food was good, but not brunchy.

I believe the manager seated us and was very friendly.  He told us about the building and the repurposed wood etc.... my mom was thrilled to hear about it.

Our young blond female server took forever to come to the table, wouldn't come back to check on things at all, and had very little personality.  A male server took over for her and he was much better and made some good suggestions on the menu.

The food is good.  I'm a low-carber so I asked for some suggestions.  The server suggested I have the chicken liver pate with iceberg  lettuce instead of the crostini's it's typically served with (mmmmm very good)... unfortunately the grilled squid salad has a very sweet dressing on it (delicious, but not low carb)... I guess I can't expect servers to understand what \"low carb\" or \"no sugar\" actually means.

Anyway, 3 stars is appropriate.  Great location, good food, a fun manager, and at least one decent server!  I'll definitely check it out again, but not for the high carb Italian food... hahah definitely a good patio session is in order!"}
{"text":"Ok just so you know, this is not your typical Italian restaurant with pasta, meat sauce, etc. They \"claim\" to be \"authentically Italian, from Italy\".  The menu is super confusing unless you speak Italian. I am warning you because you won't find many pasta options. For example, they don't have Lasagna, Ravioli, etc. Then they gave us jugs of warm water (105 degrees outside).  Who wants warm water on a hot night?  Next, the Asian waitress we had was very impatient with our menu questions.  I thought it was just me that noticed that, but then 2 other people in my party mentioned that she was quite rude. Also, no bread was served while we waited for our meal.  I guess they only serve bread for an additional $2?  The food was so-so, light on the sauce for the pizza I ordered, but my appetizer was good.  I had to complain to the manager, who was nice, about our rude Asian waitress.  I don't normally ever complain but she was that rude.  I was ready to walk out, but I was with a large group of 11 people.  If it was just me and my family, we would have walked out.  Don't go there is my advise."}
{"text":"Cute, cozy restaurant in downtown Phoenix. Nice alternative to waiting hours to get into Pizzeria Bianco. The pizza here was delicious, with yummy varieties to choose from. I haven't tried the regular italian food on the menu, but I've heard it's good as well."}
{"text":"We had some appetizer with rice in the middle-not worth it. Don't get it. I would get the dessert appetizer or something else. The pizza was delicious we had the one with pear in it. Nice environment bit slow service and we went at like 5 on a Saturday. Good, but not as good as I've heard through the reviews."}
{"text":"Farm to table. I love it. This is a quaint, cute lil cottage. You can sit inside and enjoy the quirky artwork or you can sit al fresco and enjoy the beautiful AZ spring weather. I read reviews about the pizza and wanted to try it. Unfortunately, I arrived here for lunch and pizza is only served for dinner. Fail! But I was pleasantly surprised that my spinach salad was so tasty! It had candied pecans, fresh strawberries and grilled shrimp. Tasty!"}
{"text":"I think that if you come here with a large group, the wait is longer, but I came here with only one other person, and we were seated right away. However, we sat inside and wished we could have experienced the lovely outside ambience. Next time. The two of us shared a pizza and it was perfect! One of the best pizzas I have ever had, and I would consider myself to be a pizza lover. I would now like to try Pizzeria Bianco so I can compare the two."}
{"text":"Visited for dinner on a Friday @ 7pm with 3 other people. Was seated quickly.  We ordered the cheese/meats board. It was delicious. We shared two pizzas. One was a mozzarella/meat pizza. It was great. The other was a pesto w/ potato... it was just OK. Overall, the food and service was good. This is not my first visit here. Been here a few times. Have been satisfied each time I have eaten here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in downtown Phoenix.  If you like authentic Italian pizza then this is one spot you'll want to dine at.  I love pizza and not just any pizza either, I love great authentic make your mouth watery I wish I could eat 2 pies worth pizza.  This one makes that list.  It's a good place to take a date on.  Sit outside in the spring and you'll enjoy the patio lights they have.  Staff was friendly and the food is awesome if you like pizza.  They do have a full menu, but I only go for the pizza.  Can you tell I like pizza?  yom yom yom yom yom"}
{"text":"Warm and full of character, a rarity for Phoenix.   East to get in and out of.  We sat in the newly added area (server told us)  - the addition was done in a tasteful way.  Adds some needed inside space although I cannot wait to try the HUGE patio in the winter.  We were on our way to a concert at Comerica Theater, the restaurant is just a few blocks north.  Food portions were appropriate and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Love Cibo!  Always on the look out for great tasting food mixed in with a little (or a lot) of ambiance.  In a word- yum!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here for a night out as a thank you for her photo shoot. It was absolutely delicious and gorgeous. It was only a few months after I came back from Italy and the food and ambience was perfect. I can't wait for my husband to take me here."}
{"text":"Best date restaurant! Great atmosphere, better pizza than bianco, good wine and great desserts."}
{"text":"UMM... YUM! Everything I had was perfect. Super happy customer. I walked into this place a little hesitant but it's always those places that exceed your expectations! I had the vegetariano pizza highly recommend it! This place is a deff hidden gem! Go explore people, this will be worth your while :)"}
{"text":"I don't understand the great reviews for this place. I went here on a nice evening and decided to sit outside. The atmosphere outside is alright. Cute little old house set up. Big deal. 
The service is horrible and our waitress didn't seem to listen at all. We ordered some bruschetta. It was ok at best. We then said we were probably interested in trying the lasagna, but to come back in a few more minutes. We told her we changed our minds on the lasagna and wanted to share a four cheese pizza. About 5 minutes later, we get lasagna. She said sorry it came out so fast and the pizza would be out in 10 minutes. We decided it wasn't such a huge deal and we could take that home. However, it is totally rude for one person to get their food and not the other person. Who does that?? We then get our pizza. 
On to the awful food. Like I said, the bruschetta was ok. Postinos is 100 times better. The lasagna, we just boxed. My boyfriend ate it the next day and said it was horrible. I make much better at home, and this was some extra special dish they had. The pizza.......oh my. It SERIOUSLY tasted like I took a bunch of cheese and melted it in the microwave. It was some of the worst pizza I have ever had. 
I will never go back. Horrible service and horrible food. I don't get why they have such good reviews. Maybe because it is in downtown and its a cool place to go hang out. Go to Angels Trumpet."}
{"text":"Cibo is an Italian joint located right on 17th avenue SW, right across from Made by Marcus. I've visited before but didn't write a review so here I goooo.

Amanda, Dani and I wanted to go savage on the last day of 2017 but none of us were craving anything in particular. Amanda remembered that Cibo has half price pizza on Sundays so that was a no brainer. We headed over and showed up around 7pm. It was busy since it was NYE so there weren't any available tables, only by reservation. The lady up front told us that the wait would be long but if we were okay sitting on the stools in front of the kitchen we could be seated right away since there were some available at the time. We honestly just wanted food so we were fine with it. 

We went to have seats and our server came up to us and brought menus and a glass pitcher of water. She told us that even though its NYE, Sunday half price pizza still applies - WOOHOO! I wanted to try the truffle fries because I love fries so we ordered those. We all wanted pizza so...we got one for each of us. I went with the pepperoni, Amanda went with the goat cheese and Dani went with the prosciutto. While we were waiting for food, we were just sitting there watching all the action going on in the kitchen, it was really neat to watch them make fresh dough, felt like it was the best seats in the house! 

Fries came first and they looked awesome. Piled high, topped with grana padano and truffle oil there was a perfect hint of sea salt. Some fries were crispy, some were not but they tasted great. It came with a side of dip which didn't look too appealing but it tasted alright. We were trying to figure out what the dip was, D said margarine and A said mayo. I think it was supposed to be some sort of garlic aoili or something but we never did ask. After the fries, we continued to watch the kitchen action, so funny when we knew our pizzas were coming because we watched them be made. Pizza finally came and they looked great. We swapped pieces so I was able to try all of them:

Pepperoni - roasted sweet peppers, mushroom, caramelized onion - this was really flavorful, I could really taste everything quite well, crust was thin. I really enjoyed the sweet taste of the peppers on the savory pepperoni pizza.

Prosciutto - radicchio, caramelized onion, arugula, grana padano fig jam - this was my favorite. There was a heaping of prosciutto on top with some arugula sprinkled with grana padano. The fig jam on the pizza was obvious and was really nice, the sweetness of the jam made for a really good combination - the crust was a little thicker than pepperoni which I liked.

Goat Cheese - black olives, caramelized onion, arugula, artichoke, smoked eggplant - a handful of arugula on top of the pizza, I found to be the 'healthier' out of the 3. Black olives were strong but the caramelized onions helped tame it. The artichoke and eggplant was a nice change for a pizza topping. Good option for vegetarians!

At the end, we ate EVERYTHING. I did mention we wanted to go savage, right? Service was really good; our server was sweet and attentive. The food took longer than expected but she apologized and we understood because it was NYE. We all had different opinions on our favorite pizzas but for me it went Prosciutto, Pepperoni then Goat Cheese.

Half price pizza at Cibo is so worth it, we were shocked how inexpensive the bill was and how tasty everything was! I will be baaaaaaaack."}
{"text":"This place can do no wrong. Everything I've ever eaten here has been amazing! Not only that they have great servers and carry Lemoncello!"}
{"text":"Coming from out of town, I always see what people on Yelp have said about good restaurants.  This one popped pretty high on the list, so I was excited to try it.  
I was not disappointed.
Portions are generous.
Quality is superb.
Wait staff is focused on making sure you have a good dining experience.
Price is very reasonable for the quality/quantity and atmosphere.
Had the House Salad, Old Monkeyshine Nimbus beer (excellent Tuscon, AZ brew) and the ilTagliere (sampling of meats, cheeses and veggies).  Every bite was fantastic.
Their focus is pizza.  They only serve pasta a few nights, and last night was not one of them, so I'll be back to try the hand-made pasta.  I can't wait."}
{"text":"No bills barred when it comes to food. On any given night at one of the valley's upscale venues, witnesses have already caught me spending 300$ for a la carte dinner. So what's the biggie about going to Cibo to drop 20$ on lunch? 

I ordered two hot vegetarian sandwiches ($9.50 ea) on saltimbocca bread and chose salad for sides. The topside of the bread was a beautiful golden brown, the bottomside was overdone. But I knew what to expect from the pictures on Yelp reviews. Still though, burnt bread is bread burnt. 

What I didn't expect is the first bite. I went in with an open mind. Hmmm. What's that familiar taste? Bread. So I took another bite towards the middle of the sandwich. A little better, I got a faint flavor of grilled veggies. But the overpowering component - bread.

SMH. Cibo, ccibo, chibo. I know y'all are all 'bout it 'bout it when it comes to your wood oven baked saltimbocca bread, but can a customer get some filling up in here? Where's the filling?! Veggies sliced thin and not generously applied across either sandwich. Sauce spread so thin that I couldn't taste it. Spread so thin, I could barely see it - the inside of the bread was still white. 

But hold on, I was sensing something. Feeling. I was feeling like you robbed me, Chibo. Come on! Forget ch'you! I'll make myself a real sandwich!

In order to even enjoy the amazing flavor of grilled veggies, I had to combine the two. But here's the sinker. When I was done combining them into one, you couldn't tell that I ever had two sandwiches. The one sammie now looked normal.

For taste, Cibo gets a 4.
For presentation, I'll give 3.
For value, the restaurant only gets a 2.
Overall 3.5 outta 5 estrellas.

Will I visit again? Of course. 
It's a beautifully kept place with easy foods and quick service. 
Salads are great too."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times, its a bit hard to find if you don't know your way around Phoenix. The 1900's Bungalow is amazing, I like to sit outside on the Patio in the fall and listen to the Music. The service is outstanding. Lunch time is for Sandwiches- order the fruit salad with it....
dinner is for amazing Pizza, Biancos is great, expensive and too damn long a wait, Al Fornos in Glendale is great but too noisy, Cibo is right in the middle, great food served in a unique setting"}
{"text":"I've been fortunate enough to be coming to Cibo since the family did their own opening. Wonderful pizza, I always have to get the antipasto platter for those amazing balsamic onions. Great beer & wine selection."}
{"text":"this place is str8 fire

please, when you go, start off with the Arancini. i didn't know these things existed and now i feel foolish for going so long in my life without them. They are basically just like little balls of rice, stuffed w cheese, breaded, and deep fried. no nonsense, just wondrous, lush cheesy fried goodness.

when you are inside the restaurant, you feel like you are at home because 1) its inside a little old house basically and 2) great vibes. service was very friendly and accommodating (we had a big group)

since we had a big group, we opted for a pizza/wine spread to keep things simple. thus, i can't comment on things like pasta, salads, etc. however, if they have the same quality as the pizza that means they are bomb. and everything is bomb. i love this place"}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood dining experience. Sat outside with a 20 month old( I would hesitate to take her inside-looks like a date night crowd, but manager loved her was helpful and they have a high chair.  Food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Located in downtown Phoenix in an old adorable bungalow .. we shared a yummy dinner at this trendy \"vegetarian\" friendly joint.

We arrived during happy hour and shared the 3 meatball & crusty bread ($3) the meatballs were huge & tender and the sauce was delicious.. the bread was dense and perfect to clean up all the sauce:.

We split a fungi pizza.. sauce, mushroom, mozzarella on top of this crunchy on the outside soft in the middle crust .. it definitely was on point.. great flavor.. I had the pappardelle bolognese with the yummy meat sauce .. pasta was aldente and just enough sauce.. my bf had the sausage sandwich with the truffle fries . He loved the sandwich.. 

We split the berry crepe.. it was pretty to look at but when we cut into it and the mascarpone & berry jam/sauce oozed out .. oh wow and that lemon zest added just a hint of flavor .. perfect flavor combo!

Definitely worth a trip into downtown to visit this place .."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm really glad I came here tonight! I've heard lots of good things about this place and finally came here for dinner tonight. What a treat!  It turned out to be a really positive experience, and I had a good time.

My friend and I were seated right away and we decided to sit inside instead of on the patio. Neither of us had been here before, but since it seems to be a popular joint, and we had an idea of what to expect.  The place is an old house turned restaurant, and its really well decorated.  Nothing over done, but done just right.

Our server was real a real cute guy, and he told us all about the menu.  If you want to get one pizza and do half and half, you can do that.  They also have a great wine and alcohol menu as well, and I wish I would have ordered something to go with my pizza.

I went with the dovita pizza, which came with cheese and salame.  Tasty!  My friend got a half and half pizza, but I can't remember which one.  Food was all around good, and service was awesome.

I would love to return in the future as it was a really wonderful experience.  I love you Cibo!!"}
{"text":"Initially me and my boyfriend were going to eat at Crescent Ballroom, and on the drive there we happened to see Cibo and we were feeling adventurous so we decided to stop there since the ambience looked sooooo cute! We ended up really happy with the pizza. We got two selections and both were pretty tasty, especially the spicy pepperoni, me and my boyfriend have been back for one other visit and both times we left pretty pleased :)"}
{"text":"It is axiomatic in Phoenix that the better the restaurant is, the worse the parking. The parking at Cibo is atrocious. Aside from the cutthroat street-side parking, there are something like six parking places in the back. 

That being said, the food here is amazing. Cibo has two distinct menus: a lunchtime and dinnertime selection. Sandwiches are during lunch and Pizzas are dinner. Pizzas are not served here during lunchtime since the wood oven requires different temperatures for sandwiches. If you NEED a pizza, arrive in the evening. 

This is not to say that the sandwiches are worth skipping. They are delicious. The bread is a perfect blend of crisp and soft. A lunchtime visit is definitely recommended. 

However, the star of the show here is the pizza; their pizzas are amazing. There is JUST enough char from the wood ovens to give the dough that brittle crispness that is a sign of a great thin-crust pizza. Their ingredients are fresh and each bite gives a discernible taste for each ingredient in the pizza. It is not a mish-mash of grease and spice like so many other pizzas are. 

For dessert, you must get their crepes. Their crepes make a perfect end to a wonderful meal.

The service here is extremely friendly and accommodating. 

To give an idea of how good this place is, here is an anecdote. We went to Cibo in the middle of summer late in the afternoon. It was about 113 degrees Fahrenheit outside. When we arrived we found out that their air-conditioning was out. 

We stayed anyway."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in downtown phoenix. Their patio is very cute - I would definitely recommended sitting outside when the weather is nice. 
Everything we ordered was very good - there were 4 of us and we ordered a few things to share: 

Pear salad - an arugula salad with balsamic, pears, honey, cheese, and toasted almonds - Very good, would definitely recommend! 

Burrata - creamy mozzarella with a balsamic glaze served with prosciutto and toast  - so good but not enough toast in the cheese-to-bread ratio! 

Vegetariana pizza - a pizza with mozzarella, artichokes, zucchini, roasted red peppers - comes with mushrooms but we asked for it without. This was good but the veggies are separated by section - so you only get one type of veggie on a slice of pizza, rather than having it mixed. 

Prosciutto Crudo pizza - sauce, mozzarella, topped with prosciutto. Very tasty but the pizza is cut before the prosciutto is added to the pizza, so you have to recut it to avoid ending up with all the prosciutto on one piece. 

Pizza is good - very thin crust and all the ingredients seem very fresh. 

Service was pretty good - although they must have been training when we were there, they seemed to get the tables confused and kept attempting to drop off items we hadn't ordered. But normally the service is great. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is good. It's definitely no Pizzeria Bianco but not many places are. One bite of the Rosa Pizza from Biancos and it blows everything on the menu of Cibo out of the water. I'd go back to Cibo if the wait at Biancos was more than 2 hours. 

anyway, the food is good, they serve arugula on everything which is unnecessary. But still delicious. 

The wait is too long. Im all for waiting, but it better be AMAZING food, and I just did not find Cibo to be amazing. The Parlor also blows this place out of the water. 

The restaurant itself is quite lovely. Its a cute little spot in the downtown district and it feels like your going to someones house rather than a restaurant. The staff is pleasant as well."}
{"text":"Amazing, feel good food that I can't get enough of. Staff is always professional and genuinely welcoming with a charismatic charm."}
{"text":"I still haven't figured out the new bandwagon of the burned crispy crust pizza usually associated with the much cheaper frozen-for-microwavables. Congratulations, you served a \"new kind of pizza\" because you threw 2-3 items usually not thrown together on top of a big oven cracker.

All that disclaimer being said, go to Humble Pie and get their Fig & Prosciutto pizza. It really is the exception to the rule. Plus, there's the not burnt bonus, and crust I'd consume. It was hard for me to admit out loud that the cacophony-pizza craze had a desirable item for a guy who would still like to enjoy his food if he's having to pay for it in duplicate all for the atmospheric air of trend."}
{"text":"Amazing food, taste and quality. Pizza came out under 5 minutes after ordered, loved it. 

Get these:
DaVinci pizza +sausage and roasted red peppers 
Margarita pizza 

Friday night love jazz till 10 made a great date night atmosphere, and a group of 20+ mid twenties group behind was having a fun time too. 

Calzones are HUGE
Bruschetta was only thing not good"}
{"text":"I went here last night after a 4 year break. The last time I went I wasn't overly impressed. My experience last night reaffirmed my original judgment. 

I will give them a 5 out of 5 on service and ambiance.  We sat out on the patio with twinkling lights and live music from the flute player. A very nice and romantic setting. 
We had the meatballs for a starter and they were really good and a very generous portion. We had to take some home in order to not spoil our appetite for the pizza. 

We got the capricciosa pizza that has mozzarella, prosciutto cotto, artichoke, black olives, and mushrooms. I guess it's  shame on me for not realizing that prosciutto cotto was not prosciutto as I know it but sliced deli meat ham, and the artichoke tasted like it came out of a jar. Over all the pizza lacked any distinguishing flavors, very bland and a lack of texture in the toppings.  The pizza crust was thin and crispy, maybe we just ordered the wrong thing? 

I won't say don't go, but I'm not rushing to go back."}
{"text":"Cibo never disappoints. Best patio in Phoenix and the menu and service to match. The patio manages to transport you to some kind of Pizza Paradise. Choices are unique and the menu has something to offer everyone. The Mixed Vegetables are grilled to perfection and my personal fave. Go for the patio, stay for the culinary party in your mouth. PS if the patio is full, enjoy the comfy house and bar area anyway, they will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Cibo is such a fun place to go for a delicious Italian dinner.  The setting is an old converted bungalow style house in a residential downtown Phoenix neighborhood.  There is complimentary valet parking (recommended).  The front of the restaurant is a large tree covered patio with twinkle lights glowing in the evening.  There is often live music outside on the weekends.  The wine selection is great and the servers are helpful in selecting the right wine to accompany your meal.  We always order the burrata as an appetizer followed by their amazing pizza, salad and the decadent Nutella crepes.  Our favorite pizza is the Diavola.  The meat is spicy and delicious.  Adding ricotta cheese to any of their pizzas is an option that just takes the pizza to a whole new level of yumminess!  Service is attentive and relaxed.  I highly recommend Cibo.  It would be a great place to take out of town visitors or to celebrate a special occasion."}
{"text":"Took someone out on a date here as per recommendation from a friend and was completely blown away! Their pizza is the best I've had in a long LONG time, accompanied by fantastic wine and some great company =) The service was boast-worthy and the establishment is a quaint little atmosphere that can cater to your needs; giving you a great place if you look dress-casual for a nice night of drinks or shorts and a t-shirt if you're just looking for some good eats and a relaxing night off. Cibo is really a gem!

Keep singing,

-Jerron"}
{"text":"What a wasted opportunity. Great location, one of the best patios in Phoenix and the opportunity for an authentic hand tossed French/Italian pizza ... The location and ambiance deliver, Unfortunately the food just doesn't. I had a great time. The service was good but the food was below average. I sampled three pizzas - all were bland - not bad - but not up to any reasonable expectation for a $16 personal pizza. The pesto salad was short on pesto and there are no draft beers available. The best part of the meal was the Lemoncello at the end   We deserve better Phoenix"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great atmosphere, fantastic food and service. Patio is a great spot, bistro lights and cute decor. Definitely ideal for a date night."}
{"text":"My date and I dined here on Saturday, V-Day weekend and ordered the special they had there. The appetizers were a plate of cheese and various sliced meat. Which was delicious by the way. The main course was roasted quail. For dessert we had smores with blood orange sorbert. All this for a price of $65. Quite a deal I'd say.   Overall a good experience.  Will definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE the ambience outside! Love the fact the restaurant is in a old style bungalow and the patio is lit with string lights.

I went there for the first time last night 15min before close and I dont know if they usually have music or not..but if they don't, they need it. 

Food was great but nothing to die for."}
{"text":"Cibo I love you. Your margarita pizza, pesto salad, borata, and everything else on the menu is PERFECTION!  Also I just want to squeeze the adorable little couple who owns this place, they are so kind and their work ethic is unreal, they are never not there knee deep in the chaos!"}
{"text":"Really mediocre experience. We felt the waiter was kinda scattered and couldnt manage our large party. Food orders weren't taken accurately or timely and some people were billed incorrectly. The food was just okay... no one in our group raved about any of their items. Another bummer was that they only service wine and beer, but lacked a strong list of either. My bf and his friend hated the beer that the waiter recommended and I wasn't thrilled with their Sauvignon blanc. I had high hopes for this place bc of the great reviews but sadly it didn't live up to its stars."}
{"text":"What a wonderful , quaint place.  Our server Britanny was just fabulous 
The food was amazing as was the atmosphere.  We met the owner who was as charming as his restaurant.  
I am so looking forward to going back.  
Thanks for such a great experience"}
{"text":"Although I came with a girlfriend of mine, I would say this is the perfect place for a first date. The staff is friendly and the ambience is warm and inviting- not too fancy. On top of that, the food is absolutely amazing. The pizzas are supposed to be personal, but they are huge!!! They have a nice wine list as well. I also had a salad to start out with which they give you bread and oil and vinegar to go with it. I tried the spiced oil and vinegar and it was delicious. Definitely took my pizza home and had it for breakfast the next day. Will be coming back here when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"My dear Cibo - do not get too big for your britches.  When my husband calls to make reservations, do not call him \"Dude\" and \"Bro.\"  Don't tell him that we will be \"lucky to get in\" at 7:30 and that you don't take reservations after opening.

Also, the waitstaff appears to be in a constant state of change (not the bartenders, but the waitresses/ers.  The woman we had this past Tuesday was below average at best.  Yes, everyone has an off day, but when you work in one of the hottest places in Phoenix... and make your money off tips... MIGHT want to liven up a bit.

Cibo, you are our PLACE!  So live up to our memories and keep them going into the future!"}
{"text":"If you like pizza then you have to get yourself to Cibo! If you don't like pizza I am not sure I want to know you. 

This cute restaurant has a warm and charming atmosphere that is perfect for a romantic date, or just a fun night out with friends. I came here two nights in a row because the first time I tried it it was so good I couldn't get enough. We had multiple pizzas with completely different flavors (some of which I wasn't sure whether I would like), and they were all to die for! I love pizza, but this place takes it to a whole new level. Get an appetizer, some wine, a dessert and it is a perfect night."}
{"text":"This place is romantic.
Seriously. 
Reese Witherspoon movie romantic.
Housed inside a lovely old home.  Nice little garden out front, with twinkling lights strung over head. 
If you recently messed up with your lady friend, a bottle of wine on this patio and prior transgressions will be forgiven.
And you know what? The food is good! Really good.  All fresh, home made pasta, fire oven pizza's, everything made with care and attention to detail.  
Parking can be a hassle, but worth it."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE Cibo!! I think it is the best in the Valley....(sorry, Pizzeria Bianco.)  It has a great, intimate and romantic atmosphere.  It is located inside a cozy old home in Dowtown PHX with a great patio equipped with twinkling lights....can you say \"first date spot??\"  I can't wait to go back. The pizza was superb and the salad was delish.  Everything sounded great....I had a really hard time choosing."}
{"text":"Cibo is a good pizzeria that I have visited on several occasions. Their pizza crust is above average and their location in a renovated house with great patio is very enjoyable.


Now, the reason I won't give Cibo 4 or 5 stars has to do with service. 
(a) The \"small\" antipasto is for 2 people. When you order the \"large\" antipasto for 4 people everything comes divisible by 3. 3 pieces of bresaola, 3 pieces of prosciutto, etc. This does not make mathematical sense.
(b) You have to pace the servers. That means absolutely do not order your pizza until you are finished with appetizers. They just don't understand the issue with bringing out a pizza 60 seconds after giving you the anitpasto.
(c) The person clearing off the table after antipasto will ask you to hold on to your silverware instead of bringing you a fresh fork and knife. I hate this and never understand why restaurants do it. What rubs salt into the wound is that if you order one dessert to split between 4 people they will then bring you 4 fresh sets of silverware.
(d) On two occasions we split a bottle of prosecco to start. on both occasions the flutes had hard water stains and these are accentuated by the collection of bubbles from the liquid trying to breakdown the hard water calcium deposits. Just like removing acid from around a car battery but not what I need as a first impression at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Had lunch at CIBO today.  They only serve sandwiches at lunch.  I had the eggplant sandwich.  It was delish.  Served with a side salad.  Salad was just OK.  Ice tea very tasty.  Great urban feeling.  I want to go back in the fall and sit outside at night under the little white lights with a glass of wine and enjoy Phoenix.  And of course try one of their pizzas."}
{"text":"Cibo itself is a oxymoron. Very cozy but large. Very romantic but busy. I will explain that later. This Italian restaurant is that but much more. On the corner of North 5th Avenue and West Filmore. At night, you will see a house lit up with strings of white lights and the sound of a guitar playing sweet melodies. 
Getting there was a small challenge for me. Not being from Phoenix and not being familiar with side streets. My main route was using the freeway. Which I am not a particular fan of. 
This night, Friday, was filled with a lot of ambulances, cop cars and fire trucks with lights and sirens blazing. One incident, my wife counted around 12 of these emergency vehicles going the other way on the freeway at the same time. I just pray that they all got there on time to help the people who were in need.
Getting closer to the restaurant. You can see the tall buildings of downtown. We were following the maps app but a lot of the streets are not well lit. So we missed a street or two. Luckily we did find the restaurant. Again the strings of white lights and the guitar music were a good indicator that we were here. Plenty of parking on West Filmore street.
Besides the front patio dining. They have a small bar once your inside. The bar itself holds, at most, 9 individuals. A good selection of bottled beers, wine and shots of different cocktails. My wife tried a limoncello drink that she thought was real good. Too bad she got the last one so she couldn't order another.
What makes this restaurant cozy but large is the inside of the restaurant is broken up into smaller rooms. So you never see everyone who is dining there. You can just focus on your present company and the meal you are sharing. This also explains the being romantic and busy part. Waiting for your table you see servers and patrons going back and forth. It's not until you get seated into one of those smaller rooms that everything starts to slow down.
The crowd that eats there is a very diverse crowd. From hipster guys and gals to men in suit and ties and women in dresses. Young and old come here.
And they come for the atmosphere but mainly for the food. Great Italian fare. Pizzas, pasta dishes, colorful salads. The food is amazing. House chop salad is great, 3 pairs of different prepared bruschetta is great and the bolognese sausage dish that I had was so good. It was all delicious. If you come here. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Mmmm, good.  It's like Pizzeria Bianco but without the wait."}
{"text":"The Porcellino sandwich is excellent!  It's pulled pork on great saltimbocca bread baked fresh daily.  The iced tea is fresh and is wonderful!  Sit outside in the garden and enjoy the soon to be cooler weather.  For dessert have a yummy crepe!"}
{"text":"Simple scrumptious. I love Cibo. I've been there for lunch a couple of time and the best thing is the dough. The sandwiches are so good. I recently went there for dinner. We sat outside and  there were plenty of heaters to keep you warm. It was nice because there was live music and the atmosphere was lovely. The pizza is my favorite. I think it's way better that Pizza Bianco. The selection is far greater, the staff is friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is welcoming. I love that the outside dining area is smoke-free. This is one of my favorite places to go. The crepes are amazing. We ordered the banana & nutella crepe and added strawberries on top. This is the kind of place where you can enjoy yourself and relax. You don't feel rushed to leave."}
{"text":"Last night, I took my mother to Cibo for her first time. It was my third time. First of all, there is complimentary valet (which we did not use), but the parking lot is TINY. We ended up parking a bit away at the Salvation Army establishment. Once we walked to the entrance, we signed in (they send you a text message once your table is ready), and we were lucky enough to sit at the two chairs outside the front door. But please be aware; the waitresses carelessly kick the door open as they walk outside, and after we watched this happen over and over again, we decided it to be a danger. So if you have little ones, DO NOT let them wander by the front door. Her initial reaction to the loudness inside the restaurant was shock. Beware; the sound levels on a busy night are near-deafening. Also, the tables are situated very, very close to each other, so this is definitely not a good idea for a romantic dinner. We both ordered the pulled-pork sandwich made with fresh charbroiled buns. The pulled-pork was delicious and the buns were tough, but was okay, because we ate our sandwiches with a fork and knife. After dessert, we ordered cr√©pes! I had the Nutella and Banana, and she had the Nutella and Mascarpone (fancy cheese). My cr√©pe was excellent, and cost $7.50, which is worth it in my opinion. Her's cost $8.00 and was great, but she complained of not being able to taste the cheese. All in all, we enjoyed our food and dessert, and ultimately, recommend you try Cibo, and if at all costs possible, during a non-busy time of the day."}
{"text":"This is still one of my fave places. I always get the quattro fromaggio with a side of prosciutto. We also had salad and the donuts for dessert. So dang tasty. Friendly service and cute atmosphere. Go early if possible because it gets busy and crowded very quickly."}
{"text":"Very pleasant experience. I enjoyed dinning outside on a beautiful evening. Romantic atmosphere."}
{"text":"LOVE the food there--the pizza, the saltimbocca, everything.  If you haven't tried the Nutella and banana crepe, get down there today!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix! The ambience is lovely and magical. Indoor seating is nice if you want that homey downtown vibe, as it is located in an old house with fun creaky floors and warm mood lighting. 

Outdoor seating is my personal favorite. I have always gone on weekend nights so there is sometimes live (but not overwhelming) music and quaint lights wrapped around the trees surrounding the tables. 

And as though the ambience wasn't enough, oh my god the food! My favorite pizza the is the diavla (spell?) which is a spicy salami pizza, and it tastes like what dreams are made of... The crust is crispy and the ingredients taste fresh! And the dessert! I HIGHLY recommend ANY crepes. They don't mess around. Fluffly and not to sweet, and always a perfect compliment to the nutella or fruit or vanilla ice cream. Honestly, they could probably put a pork chop in one of their crepes, and it would still be fantastic. Hahaha.

Perfect date night or girls night out or a good \"show your parents from out of town an awesome place\" restaurant. 

Only downside? The wait... But I can't say I don't understand why there is one, and believe me... It is WORTH the wait :)

UPDATE: We have since moved from Phoenix, but whenever I have friends that are visiting, Cibo is first on my list of recommendations. Also, whenever we are in town, we always try to hit it up. Also, I'm gluten free now, since this original review, and Cibo has GF pizza nowwww!! YES!!! And it's good! So, I STILL highly recommend (It's worth the wait)."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of hype.... I was excited to finally try this masterpiece! The staff is fun and the restaurant a cute area. Parking sucks as usual for downtown Phoenix. The menu, confusing. I have a gluten intolerance so I was very excited to know they make their own gluten free crust. You can spilt the pizza in half which was cool but it was honestly a crappy pizza. They don't offer ranch because it's \"authentic.\" It was bland and dominos honestly is way tastier! I didn't get the crepe because the pizza alone was a whopping $22. You're better off going to fired pie.... Or dominos. Disappointed I didn't get the crepe, I'm sure those are delicious. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Cute lunch spot especially on a warm Arizona day... Which is like everyday. The outdoor patio makes you feel right at home as well as the tiny birds that fly right in front of your face.
I felt like I was sitting in my own front yard catching up with a Lon lost friend over lunch. The food was good but overhyped. Judging from reviews I honestly expected more and so did my taste buds. But the atmosphere was nice and the hot sandwich just okay. 
I'd recommend if you prefer a more serene and less crowded lunch date."}
{"text":"Delicious.  They have this multi-cheese pizza (3? 4?) don't quite remember - but it was fantastic.  Only problem is that the place can get crowded and loud.  Tables are really close together.  Wish they offered takeout, but in the meantime, I'll keep heading over for their homemade mozzarella.  Husband loves it too.  I hear they have a fantastic wine selection as well, but I don't drink so I can't review that specifically."}
{"text":"This is a great quasi-Italian pizzeria.  They have spectacular wood-fired pizzas with high quality ingredients.  

We had the burrata to start with and it was great.  A huge portion at a reasonable price.

I had the tartufata pizza.  I loved the white truffle oil.  It would have been great to have porcini mushrooms rather than cremini mushrooms, but it was great nonetheless.

We also had the calzone and vegetarian pizzas.  They were also very good.

The limoncello wasn't great -- they use Everclear which is too harsh of a liquor.

They have a great selection of wines.  Good values and less common finds in the US.

Our server was very good, it was very busy, so he wasn't always right there, but made sure that we were always taken care of and the food came out on time and hot."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite pizza places.  People have been recommending this place since I moved Downtown, and I am glad I finally decided to take a few friends there for dinner.  The pizza did not disappoint.  The friendly, service oriented staff was happy to make recommendations and highlight some tasty choices on the menu.  I will definitely go back.  Only down side for a vegetarian - double check the menu descriptions (lots of prosciutto)."}
{"text":"Very quaint restaurant in historic Phoenix. Pizza are excellent, however could use more toppings. Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday for brunch with a couple of old friends who were in town for the sad Cardinals game.  At least brunch was wonderful.  On one of the first pleasant mornings of the fall, is there a better way to have tasty food than outside with friends.  My omelet with Schreiner's  sausage hit the spot.  A couple of other folks had the Uvoa Arizona - eggs with chorizo and green chili, which were quickly scarfed.  A mimosa topped off the morning while the friends headed to disappointment in Glendale, Gale and I treked home for an afternoon of Sunday newspapers and pleasant company."}
{"text":"The ambience is great and just shy of being too hip. Waitstaff was super friendly--felt like I was eating at a friend's house, but guess that's the point.

Limoncello and chocolate desserts were great. Our waitress suggested we get the chocolate one over ice cream. You should try it.

Didn't try the pizza. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Cozy and beautifully constructed lil restaurant. From the decor, to it's location, literally your local neighborhood pizza joint but without the joint-like feel. 
Girlfriend and I came to the restaurant midday and we were seated promptly. Of course we chose to sit outside to not only enjoy the weather(rare in AZ since it is generally hot) but the scenery as well. I imagine it to be quite romantic had we gone at night. Nonetheless the food was great, we decided on half tartufata/capricciosa. The truffle oil in the tartufata was definitely an acquired taste because the smell of it was something else. I am by no means an expert on these types of oils but I thought it was interesting while the girlfriend thought it smelled, and not in the good way. 

I would definitely come back to not only experience the atmosphere again, but perhaps try their other pies."}
{"text":"I love Cibo.  Their sandwiches are delicious. Their pizza is fantastic.  The ambiance is excellent.  Service is good.  The price is appropriate.  I often take business partners here for lunch."}
{"text":"I've been to Cibo numerous times, and I feel it's losing a bit of its footing as one of the best pizzas in the valley. The crust on the pizza came out dry and half of it was burnt black around the edges. Also I've always wanted to have dessert but never had room until last night. I was excited to try the Nutella and marscapone crepe....what an utter disappointment! There was barely a full teaspoon of Nutella and I couldn't even find the marscapone. I literally felt like I ate a plain crepe.  If you want a fantastic pizza with little wait, check out Lamp in N. Scottsdale...you won't be disappointed!! So much better!!"}
{"text":"Cibo, by far, has been a long time favorite for me and most of my friends. The atmosphere, service, and food never disappoint."}
{"text":"I would say 3.5 stars, but I'll round down because I am in no rush to go back. I ended up going here because I was planning on going to Pizzeria Bianco, but the wait was waaaaay too long. The wait here seemed long also, but I got lucky and got a seat at the bar to eat dinner pretty quickly. 

I definitely enjoyed the pizza. It's a tasty thin crust and the sausage topping had a lot of flavor. However, I did not like the calzone very much. The inside did not seem cooked like it should be. I was in the mood for ricotta cheese and was regrettably let down. In hindsight I should have tried two different types of pizza, maybe next time, if there is one."}
{"text":"Cibo is tres beau! Alright the pizza here is all kinds of amazing. I tried two kinds and quite liked it. $5 wine didn't hurt either. The tables lining the glass are ridiculously narrow though for some reason and that's kind of lame. So if they want to sit you there probably pick another spot lol. The waiters and waitresses could definitely improve on their flair. No, I'm not talking about those pins people put on vests but the way the staff present things like wine. Comparable restaurants of much better rates don't pour like a 3 year old with a sippy cup. I noticed a lady in the corner on her Macbook Pro for most of the night so I guess it's also a good place to study?"}
{"text":"Loved this place! We went on a cool  December night, the heating lamps and firepit were going outside. Tables had candle lights and the band was playing very cool blues. Such cute downtown Phoenix ambiance. Pizza's are enough for 2 or 1 hungry eater. As 3 hungry ladies, we split the Capricciosa and Margherita pizzas. They were light and yummy. Wine selection is pretty large. We shared a nutella and banana crepe desert which was also very light but so delicious. Cannot wait to visit again. Hopefully next time, we'll sit outside."}
{"text":"Great place and Awesome pizza.  3-5 weekdays $5 pizza well worth the visit!  A bit pricy the rest of the week."}
{"text":"New happy hour menu was terrific. Had the meatballs and Gnocchi. The Margarita pizza was very good. Overall, as good as Pizzeria Bianco, and there's no crazy wait."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! I have had Pizzeria Bianco and really feel like this was better!!!! The service was excellent and that wait was not bad at all.  I love taking people who haven't been here!!!!
Look forward to eating here each and every time!!!"}
{"text":"After trying a variety of pizza places in the valley, I'm glad I finally found Cibo. This was my favorite so far. I got a red pizza and the sauce was amazing. The pizza dough was perfect and the mozzarella was everything it should be. I got the spicy salami which I thought was a perfect topping but it was a little spicy for my wife. I really enjoyed the ambience and the service was great."}
{"text":"I would suggest that anyone who lives here and has not been come, and if you're in town and looking for a great local non-chain restaurant that has quality food prepared the way it should, then try Cibo!  

I took my man here for \"mystery date night\" as a surprise since he had never been.  No wait at 8:45 on a Friday night (yes! take that Pizzeria B) and the atmosphere of this house is super intimate and cool.  I love the atmosphere of the patio also, lit with those great off-white lights, and fire pits.  We shared the burrata which was gynormus, easily enough for 4 people or a hungry us.  The wine was tasty and reasonable.  I was drinking a pinot grigio, and my guy had the house chianti which I never usually order anywhere since it almost always reminds of grandmas table wine - until I tried Cibo's house version.  It was very good, definitely not from grandmas!   Now for the pizza - it is just perfection.  It has that amazing combination of char on the crust, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside with the right balance of sauce and toppings.  It almost melts in your mouth, it's not heavy at all.  It's nice to go out for a pizza dinner with and app and dessert and not feel like you have to roll yourself out of the joint!  So we finished our romantic mystery date night with a crepe filled with nutella, ricotta, AND a scoop of ice cream on top.  I don't typically die over dessert, it's my boyfriends thing.  I'm an app girl - but this, it wasn't too sweet, it was so gooey and delicious and the ice cream added just the right amount of sweetness.  I would never eat here without dessert again!  

I have been for lunch and they can get you in and out in a little less than an hour, but they don't fire up the pizza oven till supper which is why I prefer that here.  You will feel at home at this spot in a group or on a date - hell, maybe even a mystery one :)"}
{"text":"My palette isn't very sophisticated so I have to admit right off the bat I didnt understand most of the menu. I met here for a lunch meeting with someone who, thankfully, has a firm grasp on finer dining. 

I had the Spek. I dont remember the fancy terms used to describe it but basically it was a ham and cheese sandwich on some sort of flat bread. It was pretty good, and for a restaurant with a lot of fancy sounding food the price was really reasonable. Less than $10 per person as I recall.

The only downside was that its very small inside and the sound of people talking crescendos to the point that I could barely hear myself think, let alone hear what my lunch colleagues were saying. 

In the end, I left well fed and happy. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for something new and interesting."}
{"text":"Margherita pizza with baby arugula and prosciutto added after cooking...appetizer plate with cannellini bean substitution (a few years back)...crepe suzette....Cutest patio ever and great small bar where you can eat on your own!!!"}
{"text":"Recently had a gals night out here for dinner and I could not have been more impressed with the delicious food, fantastic service and beautiful ambiance! Will definitely return again and again and I've already told many friends about this gem!"}
{"text":"Lunch at Cibo is a 3 star, however dinner is wonderful(Close to a five star). There's not much to say that hasn't already been said. All their ingredients are imported from Italy. Perfect patio for Phoenix winter weather. Parking is horrible, however to have a great restaurant you have to have horrible parking. Definetly top 3 places in the valley to have pizza. Dessert is too die for."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and excellent service. I don't mind to drive all the way from Scottsdale to here more often. 
Thanks Dan."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I have ever had. I had the arugala and walnut pizza and would eat it almost every week if I could. We went for my birthday and it was definitely a treat. We had a great bottle of wine, even tried the Limoncello - its a little strong for my taste, and the grand marnier crepe was a sweet ending. The atmosphere is warm, cozy, and inviting. What a wonderful place to eat!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation online and was late and they held the table for me.  The waitress was polite and friendly and explained what the resturant was all about.  The service was very good and food ( spaghetti and meatballs) was excellent!  The spaghetti was perfectly cooked with home made meatballs!  I had a bad cold and the waitress had a special drink made up for me. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"My first fifteen minutes in the door was bizarre.  Our group had a reservation and the hostess failed to notice that two of our party had already arrived and was seated.  Instead, we were told to wait while our table was being set up.  What the...?
When this was finally sorted out and we sat down, we all came to realize how loud it was on the second floor (and likely everywhere).  I went home with a hoarse voice.  AND, it was extremely noticeable that many young ladies were there for dinner, but their girly bits were out for some air as well.  Our entire party was stunned at how many outlandishly short skirts and dresses were in the room.  We even noticed that the male servers were totally distracted.  I'm sure we looked like a bunch of old fogies harshly judging these ladies, but it was ridiculous.  Good eye candy for men who appreciate that kind of look, that's for sure.

Now down to business.  Ordering may difficult for people with decision making disorder.  I know because my spouse is one of them and it took him forever to figure out what to do.  

We tried the Buffalo Mozzarella.  Not worth it.  Now, the spaghetti \"Lille e Il Vagabondo\" is total insanity and you must order it for the sheer size.  It's got some heat and is absolutely delicious.  It also makes for great leftovers.  I ate the entire Pan-Seared Wild White Shrimp dish myself.  It was fabulous.  The pistachios and golden raisins give it some great flavor.  I tried a slice of my friend's pizza and I think it was the Wild Boar Bacon.  That was very flavorful too.  I ordered the Bellini and it was disappointing, unfortunately.  It didn't taste like much of anything.

Overall, the food I ate was delicious but the loud, crazy atmosphere and weird confusion early in the evening threw me off and I wouldn't go back by choice.  Definitely not a place for a romantic dinner or a group larger than six if you actually want to visit."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza place in town. If you go, do not miss out on getting their burrata. To die for!"}
{"text":"Cibo is a fantastic dinner spot with a beautiful garden and excellent pizza. It's easy to get a table on almost any week night. The pizza is solid, and there are a variety of choices with sauce and without sauce. Great place to take a date or just to have a quiet dinner with friends. The federal law clerk crowd loves it here."}
{"text":"Oh the caprese salad.  It's what dreams are made of. 
And the pizza. Oh and the desserts.  Well, pretty much everything is fantastico here at Cibo.  I wish I could kidnap the chef and turn him into my personal man-chef/slave so he could whip me up delicious Cibo-esque dishes whenever the mood struck.

I really am kidding about that. 

Kind of.

But really, the food here is great, the service is fine and the prices aren't bad considering how great the food is. 

The restaurant is a really cute, intimate place and my only problem with it is it's far away from my house!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I've waited so long to check this place out.  Very friendly staff and wonderful food.  Had the calzone and dessert crepe.  Both were amazing and I would certainly order again!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with this amazing cafe. Delicious coffee and treats and a fun place to meet with friends and do work. 

Matcha latte is soooo good and must try their homemade goodies. The best cafe in Sausalito by far!"}
{"text":"Never had anything bad here from pizza to appetizer to lunch including salad and/or sandwich. Always freshly cooked and staff is always very nice greeting you as soon as you arrive. May be the only place I never have to ask for more water or tea!  Perfect date night at night outside with live music and lights. Only negative sometimes can be parking."}
{"text":"This is our most favorite sit down place to eat in phoenix! We would defintely recommend making a reservation because it is always packed! The pizzas are a MUST TRY! we also got a bottle of wine which paired perfectly with our dinner. If you are in phoenix and are looking for a great place to eat then this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for a late dinner. 
we ordered the grilled vegetable plate, its served cold although grilled but to my surprise was really great with lots of special types of vegetables. 
we also got a pizza which I unfortunately cant name, but it was part of the menu that was a no sauce pizza. its was amazing as well and I suppose that is all the matters. 

Our Server was very knowledgeable and helpful with choosing a dish. appreciated him.  

We sat outside which was a great vibe.

I feel like this is a nice place for a date."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot. The ambiance is great and the food is wonderful.  I ordered the Spek.  It was delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Been dining here for years and never disappointed. Consistent good food and wine. Great service. The patio is spectacular! A great place for a date or a night out with a group! Don't forget to get a crepe for desert, so yummy!"}
{"text":"What an enchanting location! Great authentic food. We enjoyed the pizza and  a salad in the patio. The only reason I'm not giving a 5 is that we ordered the salad and then the pizza and the salad came out after we were 2/3s done with the pizza! We were also going to a show after dinner and couldn't take the salad with us. My advice us to let the staff know you're on a time line if you need food quickly, otherwise this would have been a perfect \"chill\" meal on the patio."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, beautiful patio, good service.
But most importantly the food was disappointing. The pizza looked appetizing but wasn't. I found the cheese to be bland and the prosciutto was basically diced ham. The only thing that was good was the burrata appetizer and the palline dessert."}
{"text":"I love Cibo. I've been here for lunch, dinner and take-out. They have never messed up an order or made anything less than perfect. It's my favorite pizza in Phoenix since I gave up trying to go to Bianco's. One order must be dairy-free and it's never a problem (no-cheese pizzas are a familiar order here). The nutella crepes are heavenly. 

I've taken groups, teens, family, etc., it's all good.

Don't go. I don't want to get stuck in a line."}
{"text":"Saltimbocca!

What did you call me?!

Hey, settle down. Saltimbocca is griddle bread known from Naples. Cibo Urban Pizzaria Cafe's saltimbocca bread is baked fresh in a wood burning oven. 

It was a good call to order lunch from Cibo. Not only does the cafe make a great environment to relax from the bustle of your day, but the food is pretty good too. 

Two of their vegetarian sandwiches are close to my heart. Vegetariano and the Alla Parmigiana. Both are 9.50 each and I got them with the side house salad. 

Vegetariano has grilled zucchini, roasted red bell peppers, grilled eggplant and mozzarella. 

Alla Parmigiana has fried eggplant, mozzarella, tomato sauce, parmigiano, and basil.

If you know me, you know me and a lot of cheese don't get along. So in place of the mozza I used the parmigiano slices from the salad on my sandwiches. The flavor of grilled veggies came through. And I was a happy camper. Yum yum. https://youtu.be/UoMuNARHRvk"}
{"text":"This restaurant is quaint, with trees outside doused in twinkle lights. If the weather is nice, sit on the patio and enjoy the ambience. If it's during the winter, sit inside this old house and get cozy with your friends and fellow eaters. I had pasta the last time I went and man it was fantastic.

The owners are so nice and personable. I've been here twice and the service was fantastic both times. The ingredients are fresh, and you can truly taste the difference. I remember lots of fresh basil and garlic, which always score points in my book.

Great place for a date, or to go when you have a serious Italian craving. Such a magical place."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza joints out there!!  They have wonderful pizza dough.  The sauce is amazing! The sandwiches (i've heard) are very good.  Still need to try those!"}
{"text":"The best in Maricopa County Arizona! Food, staff, music & outdoor seating if chosen are second to none! The pizza is lite/light and airy, & very palatable!"}
{"text":"This is hands down, one of my favorite spots for date night! The ambience is romantic with hanging lights, as well as the European feel of the restaurant. We ordered the antipasto, a perfect combination of meats, cheese, tomatoes, olives, etc. We then decided to get the Siena pizza, with prosciutto and zucchini. It was my boyfriend's birthday and our server was lovely enough to whip up a free Nutella crepe, with a lit candle. All in all, perfect place for date night!"}
{"text":"Really tasty pizza, I've been here twice and it is really good stuff, the Nutella crepes for desert are so good. If you like a good drink I'd recommend the limoncello, it's like a lemon drop in liquid form, the lemon concentrate is strong though hardly sour. The prices are a tad high but it's still worth it, the quality of ingredients are definitely superb and the serving sizes are generous. Definitely would be a nice place to bring a date. I would recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"Good looking food and a cute little place, but the last few times I've gone the service has been SO slow. Kind of wish there were more options that didn't involve cheese. Go on your birthday because you get the delicious crepe for free. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, great food and the patio is absolute charming. I went with a group and we ordered 7 different pizza's all of them were really good everything tasted fresh lots of different types of Italian meats and there wasn't one I didn't like. My favorite was the diaba it was had a spicy salami and was full of flavor. I'll\"ll definitely be back here and just heads up they're closed on Sunday"}
{"text":"Oven brick pizza here is delicious. Great romantic intimate atmosphere and on some nights they have live music outside. Love this place for dinner but not for lunch. I like this pizza better than the famous Bianco's pizza. Parking in the street is your only option and that is the only major complain I have about this place."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious. Really, really good. The restaurant itself is a cool little place also. Awesome patio. My wife and I each got our own pizza, shared some, and had a little bit left over. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying Cibo. As we entered I was taken by the openness yet intimacy feel of the place. The restaurant is well designed and doesn't feel crowded at all. The menu had a ton of variety with dishes grouped by cost. A very unique idea. Full range of offerings and we took advantage of half price prosecco. 

The food was very good and served family style, the place is meant for sharing so you need to keep this in mind when ordering. My partner and I ordered the Caprese salad, it was outstanding. For us gluten and no grain folks the menu can be a challenge, be sure to tell your server what your dietary needs are. 

My one and only complaint was service. I found it started off great then the server went awol for about 30 minutes right when we were ready to order causing a little frustration. It would also be nice if a manager would stop by for larger groups to check in. 

Overall though the place is vibrant, food is fresh and really wonderful for an evening out. I look forward to trying Cibo again for a more intimate dinner."}
{"text":"C   -Crust is amazing! Perfect amount of crisp and fluffiness.
  I    -Interesting location. It is in a house, on the corner, close to downtown
B   -Bruschetta! Grape tomatoes and basil, Cannetini beans, Prosciutto and mozzarella.
O   -OMG, is there really 4 cheese on that pizza!?!

Loved it, great place for a date. The night I went there was a really nice band playing for us out on the patio."}
{"text":"Cool spot to eat at, been a guest many times over the years they've been open. food never fails, service is good. Plenty of wines to choose from and plenty of fresh ingredients in use, really like this place."}
{"text":"I've always been satisfied with the food here.  Not too expensive, respectable pizzas, salads and paninis.  (No pizzas at lunch time, mind you.)  Not consistently mindblowing, but consistently good.  I think I was really impressed by the food once out of six visits or so, and the rest of the times I just enjoyed the atmosphere and drinks on the patio with family or friends.  It's a pretty little patio with trees hanging down and an organic feel to it.  Not pretentious, just pleasant.  And the staff's always been down to earth and decently cool.

Superior to Bianco if you don't have four hours to blow."}
{"text":"BEST gluten free pizza I've ever had. This is a huge deal since I'm going on five years of a gluten free lifestyle (not for the fad) and several states of tasting."}
{"text":"Yummmm..... Cibo was delicious. I had the Quattro Formaggi Pizza with Ricotta and Sausage added to it. The pizza had all the flavors I was looking for. The cheeses were tangy, but with the addition of the ricotta it really cut through and made it very savory. For dessert I got a Nutella and peanut butter crepe with whip cream and ice cream added on top. It was everything you want in a dessert. So incredibly delicious."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to Cibo 3 times and have not been disappointed yet! The atmosphere is charming - it's basically a house that was turned into a restaurant. The interior can get a bit cramped, but the outdoor seating is lovely with a gardeny-feeling and twinkle lights.

Each time we've gone, we've gotten the burrata and it's FANTASTIC. I highly recommend it to all the cheese lovers out there! We've also gotten several different pizzas (all of which are excellent) and the Tartugata and the Genova are particular favorites for us. The pizzas are a bit small, so we usually get a few appetizers or a pasta to go with our pizza. The price for the quality of food that you get is well worth it. Also, Happy Hour is a great value - I got a (generous) glass of the house red wine for $4 and it was quite good."}
{"text":"Great spot for a work lunch!

Cibo had been on my list for a while. Had a chance to eat their for a work lunch and thoroughly enjoyed it. The staff is attentive, food options are appealing, and the ingredients used all combine for a very appealing feast. Orders, drinks and bread, and meals all hit our table with perfect timing.

We had the Margherita Pizza and a Capri Salad. Both were excellent. The pizza bread was perfect and they did not make an oily mess of the cheese. The flavors of the cheese and sausage (I added) came through nicely, without overpowering. My colleage commented that her salad was fresh and also excellent. 

Will be back to try some other option!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my friend before seeing a concert downtown. It's a very nice two block walk from Cibo to The Van Buren. Our server informed us that it was still happy hour, so we had arancini and gnocchi as an appetizer, and we split a margherita pizza for dinner. All of our food was delicious, but our pizza had a few very burnt black spots on the edge - that could be normal for the style of pizza or the type of oven they used. I will definitely be back to try some of the other menu items and maybe one of the five Nutella-based desserts."}
{"text":"Try harding at it's best. 17th ave (and Calgary on the whole) is being flooded with \"monkey see monkey do\" restaurants. This one is not an exception. Great location, great space...except for the fact that there is ALWAYS a lineup for the washroom. 

Staff there (this summer - July) did not know the menu, and two of the pizza's we ordered were EXACTLY THE SAME LESS 1 INGREDIENT. I think that's a little weak for a new menu.....

Anyway. They tried to fix the situation, which was nice. 

For eating in a parking lot surrounded by boards off of 17th ave..ambience outside get's a 3/10..the rest.....just not original or well executed. 

Disappointed because it looked to have potential."}
{"text":"Been here a few times in the last couple weeks for lunches , great . Very cool atmosphere ....... Need to try the evening menu. Well worth givin it a try"}
{"text":"Never have we ever been made to feel like such a inconvenience. Our server (David or Davis) was so rude. Lacked table side manners or pleasantries. We sat for over 10 minutes without acknowledgement. Then and I quote were greeted with \"you drinking? Ok what do you want.\" Drinks were brought and just set on table with no care to who ordered what. We had three more people than expected, and no move was made to get a bigger table. Simply put very rude when It came time to order food. Short answers and a abrasive tone was used when taking our food order. When it came time for the bill, never in my life have I had a server bark \"if you want separate bills, you all need to learn a little patience.\" I was not handed my bill,rather he simply dropped It into my half eaten pizza. We were slapped with a autograt that I wish hadn't been there... well... It was his saving grace, because it's the only way he made any money off us. Deplorable."}
{"text":"Good is awful, no meats, just salads, pizza & pasta.

Not for kids, no parking, got to find a street"}
{"text":"amazing atmosphere, the pizza is incredaible...one of my favorite local resturants in town."}
{"text":"All I have to say was this was the best pizza I have ever eaten.  The gluten free pizza was like no other gluten free pizza I have ever eaten it tasted no different then the regular pizza. It's hard to go to any local pizza place now after eating here."}
{"text":"Food is 3 stars but the atmosphere is 4! Great desserts! Ask for crepe with Nutella and Reese's peanut butter inside topped with ice cream!  It's not on the menu!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Cibo after it was recommended by a friend. The restaurant is an old home creating a quaint atmosphere. They have excellent wood fired pizza. For happy hour, try the Polpette and Palline (dessert)-delicious! Service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Not much I can add to all the reviews already written so I'll keep this short.  

We were looking to have lunch after going to the science museum with the kids and my handy dandy yelp app lead us here.   Loved the space! No pizza at lunch, just paninis with the same ingredients as on the pizzas. They don't have a kids menu but my kids are fine ordering from adult menus with some adaptations, of course, and our requests were honored with no problems. We all loved our sandwiches!

We are big fans of crepes so of course we had to have dessert.  The kids got the crepe with the vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce which they devoured. My husband and I got the crepe with nutella & mascarpone --- absolute perfection!  Do yourself a favor and get a crepe, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great wine list, great atmosphere.  The crust and sauce are both excellent.  Family owned.  One of best in Phoenix.  Great place to go before concerts or games.   Have been there a few times and will always go back."}
{"text":"Their pizza is to die for! I cannot keep myself away from ordering the same thing every single time because it's basically everything I've ever wanted in a pizza. Their crust is on the thin side, which is just my style, and has a ton of flavor. Their white procida (sp?) pizza is absolutely amazing: goat cheese, prosciutto and pear deliciousness! 

The ambiance is great also. I would definitely suggest sitting on the patio (if it's not sweltering hot outside) and enjoying some live music and cocktails. This is definitely a happy place for me:)"}
{"text":"Cibo is my favorite restaurant in the valley for wonderful pizza and a relaxing night. 

I definitely recommend coming here for dinner over brunch/lunch because they have a very limited menu for brunch/lunch(I'm talking only 2 or 3 pizza options as opposed to their 20 for dinner).

Inside seating is very cute and romantic but noisy. Outside seating is amazing at night and the live music on weekends makes it the perfect date night spot. 

 
Tonight, we ordered the Tartufata and Linguine Cacio e Pepe. My fianc√© and I always order the tartufata because we love mushroom, anything truffle, and prosciutto. The pizza here is just amazing and even though the white pizza doesn't have sauce (we didn't know this even though we've eaten here like 5 times) it's still the most tasty pizza out there.  Maybe one day we will branch out to other pizzas but the tartufata is our guilty addiction and I don't think I'll ever be able to give it up.

Tonight was also our first time trying the pasta. The linguini cacio e pepe was a very mild but pleasant dish. It's mixed with butter, cheese, and pepper and while the flavor doesn't knock you out, it's still very good. Next time we'll try the bolognese.

Cibo is the perfect date night spot. The outside view is amazing with all of the twinkling lights and the live music makes everything more romantic."}
{"text":"Go here for lunch and get the pulled pork sandwich. It is heaven in a sandwich.

Also the vibe is super romantic at dinner, with beautiful lights everywhere. Don't forget to get a crepe - or you're doing yourself an injustice."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance, the feel, & the nutella crepe dessert! 

I tried the Tartufata pizza which has mozzarella, prosciutto crudo, white mushrooms
and a drizzle of white truffle oil after the pizza is cooked. I do appreciate the uniqueness of the pizza. HOWEVER, I do think that the crust was too dry. There is thin crust pizza and there is doughy pizza -- but this pizza seemed a little burnt? I did only try one pizza, so perhaps there are more tasty pizzas than this one. 

I was a fan of the Nutella and Strawberries Crepe! Added a spoonful of vanilla ice cream on top! Yum!

Overall, I love the feel of this place when eating here at night. They've got pretty lights that sets the mood! Great alternative to Pizzeria Bianco's long wait lines!"}
{"text":"I had bookmarked Cibo as a restaurant I definitely wanted to check out since I first moved to Phoenix almost a year ago. Finally, I went to celebrate my bday weekend! It was a somewhat chilly night and we sat outside but I love the heaters nearby which is awesome because outside is the place where you should sit. It's romantic, pretty, cozy, just perfect whether you are on a date or out with friends. We started with the Arancini appetizer which is arborio rice with creamy mozzarella lightly fried & served with marinara. It was absolutely perfect! It was hard to decide between a pizza or a pasta since everything sounded so amazing but I was definitely in a Pizza mood and opted for the Genova which is pesto, mozzarella, potatoes, white onions and parmesan. It was really good but for me it got a little too greasy after the 3rd slice. This is just my personal opinion as I don't do well with foods that are greasy, however it's a really great pizza. I absolutely love their crust, that is definitely something I will be thinking about for some time. There are alot of pizza's I'd love to try in the future for sure. My friends had a pizza as well but I don't recall what they ordered because frankly, I was just having too good a time focused on conversation and possibly dessert. The service was good. They were pretty busy when we got there being a Saturday night and all, but when our server came over she was lovely. A mistake was made with our order but she took ownership and made it right. I love when someone does that! No one is perfect, but when you own up to something and make it seamlessly easy for the customer to be happy it means a lot! For dessert we had a Nutella crepe w/icecream & an order of Palline (small donut balls) NICE!!! We shared all of it, and the crepe was way better than I even expected. Definitely will visit Cibo again in the future."}
{"text":"I dined here last week and I have nothing but positive things - great ambience, lovely outdoor seating, friendly waiting staff, quick seating, which is a great plus in comparison to Pizzeria Bianco, and delicious food.  Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"People rave about this place so we finally checked it out tonight. We're not impressed. We ordered Salsiccia with additional spicy salame topping. For a $17 pizza, we expected it to be loaded with meat. It was just the opposite and tasted mediocre. Fresh & Easy pizza tastes better than Cibo. The service was also horrible. The girl who brought us the pizza just plopped the pizza onto the table and walked away. She didn't even ask if we wanted another beer. For good pizza with fresh ingredients, check out Grimaldi's. My next adventure will be Pizzeria Bianco."}
{"text":"very nice and cozy restaurant. I had a great pulled pork sandwich. I would be happy to go back for a glass of wine and maybe some desert. The outdoor seating is very inviting. I realize Cibo is a pizzeria, but there were no pizzas on the menu. I don't know if they don't make them during lunch, but I definitely feel like I missed out."}
{"text":"This week the Jolly Diners went to Cibo. Started with an antipasto roasted / grilled vegetable platter which was delightful. The entrees were meatballs and crusty bread, sausage sandwich with truffle fries, and a fungi vegan pizza with marinara sauce. Everything was delicious, the atmosphere good, the service was good. The Jolly Diners rated Cibo at a 4 out of 5. For couples, Cibo had a great outdoor dining area with live music."}
{"text":"BEST GLUTEN FREE PIZZA EVER! I've been GF for a long time. This one is worth the travel. We went to wildlife zoo and headed home to the east side and hit traffic. We decided to find a place in the middle to eat. We have eaten here before but not for years. We all LOOKED like we went to the zoo. Family of five wearing flannels and baseball hats. Our server was sweet, knowledgeable, efficient and was patient with the three kids. We never felt like we were treated like we looked (happens often) - a hot mess express. We did get there by 5:30. By the time we left the place was starting to fill up. We left happy, bellies full and talking about the when we would come back."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Food is good, waiter was more than helpfull.
The place has a perfect atmosphere.."}
{"text":"Fun little pizza/Italian place in an up-and-coming area. They did a great job of creating a warm, inviting atmosphere - it's almost like walking into a friend's home/back yard (depending upon where you sit). The warm glow of the lights throughout help to create a \"homey\" rustic feel - oh so charming! We tried the Antipasto (a shareable plate) the Calamari Al Limone (sooo delish with fresh garlic, parsley, sea salt and lemon) and the Tartufata pizza (because who doesn't love fungi, prosciutto and a little truffle oil - yum!). Everything was delish and service was great!"}
{"text":"I thought I had reviewed Cibo before, but today I went to check back on what I wrote and apparently I never did. So here goes!

It's always been one of my favorite spots. The patio is incredibly cool, and a great place for a date, inside is no less cool and is awesome in decor. All the old bedrooms making the dining rooms is awesome. Antipasta is great, and pizza has always been great. I do take out here a lot and never mind eating inside either. 

Last night though, was my first visit in months, and it is just not the same. The pizza was overly doughy, and lacked that crisp wood fired taste and texture. The sauce wasn't the same, as it tasted very bitter in comparison to prior visits. I ordered the Salsicca and what used to seem like a high quality pizza, no longer did. The sausage was some sort of ground meat like substance, compared to what I remember being a high quality sliced sausage. Their wine list has changed since my last visit, and now only has one Cabernet... a rather shitty one at that. My friend had a white pizza that she enjoyed, though my observations about it were mostly the same as though it had gone downhill. 

I can't tear into the place though, as the atmosphere is too perfect. Service is spectacular as well, and though I'm bitching about the pizza, it's still great pizza. It's just not what I remember... maybe I've been eating Metro and Bianco too much lately."}
{"text":"Another place to go for thin crust pizza in Phoenix. The place looks real cool and bright.

Don't miss the desserts also."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here! The patio is cute but I've never been able to sit outside due to the hot weather (I've only been in summer or during the day). I live close so I like that I can just ride my bike/walk here. The patio is so beautiful, especially at night. Perfect date night spot, birthday, anniversary, Little perfect spot for anything! There is no liquor here, it's wine and beer only so keep that in mind if you want to drink but don't like those options. The crepes look good but I'm always too full to order dessert (not a bad thing). Parking can be a little difficult here as it shares the corner with the vig and apartment complexes but they do have valet."}
{"text":"Pizza was GREAT! Thin and crispy just like I like it! Dough is soft, toppings fresh. Cool place to eat in. Nice garden type setting outside. Service was good.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the ambiance here. I think it's truly a super cool neighborhood place to hang out and eat good food and just have fun"}
{"text":"This place is adorable, the staff give great service and the food is delicious. What's not to love!?"}
{"text":"I've been to Cibo before and the pizza is pretty good (4 stars) but last night I was exposed to quite possibly the rudest waiter I have experienced during the short time I have spent on this planet. I'm not sure if James was just having a bad night, but he seemed incredibly rushed and annoyed to have to be helping us out by taking our order and getting us some food and drink. It was bad enough for me to leave before ordering. (My friends that stayed behind informed me that it never got any better.) I get that Cibo is a busy place, James, but never be rude to people who have no control over those circumstances. Not if you want a reasonable tip."}
{"text":"A few girls from work suggested we eat at Cibos for lunch. I was a bit hesitant because I am not crazy about Italian food. But, after eating at Cibos I wanted to live there. I wanted to eat everything and proclaim of its awesomeness to the world. Instead, I decided to write a great review.
Great selection for lunch, quick service and the taste was out of this world. I tried a Salsiccia sandwich and angels sang when I started eating. Or maybe that was me...because it was AWESOME!!!
I will be frequenting this place all the time. I may just try to live there....it is that good!"}
{"text":"Was craving pizza and this was my last night in Phoenix. Yelped nearby restaurants and this one caught my eye. I love wood oven pizzas and dessert crepes and having both in one place was a dream come true. Went with my neice, who lives nearby and had never been here. The restaurant is in a great space though the location is a bit odd. This combination, for me, adds to it's appeal. The place was packed but we had a very short wait. By the time we left, there was quite a crowd gathered outside.

We started with caprese salad with homemade mozzarella. The texture of the cheese was spectacular and the tomatoes were good but not great. Perhaps that's because I'm from California, home of the sweetest tomatoes around. We decided to order two pizzas, one with red sauce and one with white because it all sounded and looked so good. We ordered the capprioso and the white pizza with pear (can't remember the actual name) The crust was the key. I'm giving Cibo 4 stars because the actual flavors of the toppings and sauce on the pizza are not as flavorful as I expected and not as bold as I like. Everything was very mellow. But man, the crust rocked my world. I might try some other toppings that have a stronger taste to see if they are better but what we picked was on the border of bland. The true highlight of the mean was the dessert crepe we ordered. We ordered two pizzas and one crepe but we should have ordered one pizza and two crepes. True, we got nutella in the crepe which is a gimme in terms of tastiness but we added strawberries and whipped cream which took it over the top. The crepe itself was light, airy and just melt in your mouth good. 

I thought about giving Cibo 4 stars but I just couldn't do it. I wanted to love everything about this place but I just didn't. When the best flavor I had was nutella, you know there's a slight the problem. I honeslty wasn't impressed with the toppings and the flavor and the quality of the pizza sauce but the crust won me over. I would definitely come back for both the atmosphere and the food and perhaps a different pizza would be better. The servers ran around and seemed to work hard though the food came out slower than I expected and the wait staff, while flying around and by often, wasn't actually attentive. If ever in Phoneix again, I look forward to trying more things on this menu but until then, I can only say it's good but not great and certainly did not blow my socks off."}
{"text":"Came here for our 1 year wedding anniversary to spend some quality time with my wife we had a good time. The bistro lights were on and the music was playing in the background., but i have to take 3 stars off pizza was mediocre (we had two white pizzas)  pasta ( the one with cheese and pepper)  and the dessert( fruit crepe with ice cream) . Very cute place to bring a date and the waiter was great! but the food was what knocked down the points for us. Didnt really get why the place is so hyped up, didn't meet our expectations."}
{"text":"It's worth going here just for the unique ambiance. The restaurant is in a converted historic home in downtown Phoenix. The food is delicious every time, and they have a huge patio for non-summer dining. The warm family feel makes for a pleasant, relaxed atmosphere. 

I think you'll agree it was worth the drive."}
{"text":"A long time favorite - I absolutely love the patio when the temperature is right. And the food is always fantastic."}
{"text":"Alright, went back last night, felt bad because we were the late nighters, and everything was perfect.  The pizza, the salads and the wine were all so well done.  And what finally brought me to five stars was the crepe with Nuteila and Mascarpone.  OMG amazing.  I'm currently craving it the day after.  Totally beats out the crepe with nutella and banana that I also love..."}
{"text":"Some of the last negative reviews are just plain whining. 

I've been eating here for years and the food has NEVER disappointed. The service is always consistent and friendly. The owners Tony and his wife, along with their son - treat you like family. Many of the servers here have been here for years.

The restaurant is located in an old vintage house - so those complaining about the atmosphere or grounds are way off the mark as the antique and rustic feeling is part of the vibe.

Is the Pizza as good as Bianco? No.

Is the pizza outstanding? Yes - no question.

Those comparing this to Bianco again again ad nauseum are missing the point. The pizza here has an extremely flavorful thin crust, and the pies are made by a real pizzailo chef straight from Italy. The pizza is generally perfectly charred, with a nice depth of flavors. This pizza is very similar to the pizza you might get in any good restaurant in Italy. 

So stop the whining and comparison to Bianco... sheesh! These are yummy pies any way you slice them, with some interesting twists like sweet aged Balsamic onions that my kids especially love. 

The salads here also rock - especially the Pesto salad with small crispy potato bits. Yum!

When you come to Cibo you will be treated like family. Sitting outside among the beautiful mature trees and the cool lights at night makes for a wonderful evening out, and few restaurants in Phoenix can match the consistently great food and ambiance. 

Desserts are outstanding, and the Nutella Crepe with vanilla ice cream is simply delicate and melts in your mouth - I like this one better than the Fresca (fresh fruit) crepe as it has a direct route to my sweet tooth.

So for the last few whiner Yelp reviwers...

I say go get yourself a pizza \"to go\" at Panne Bianco and pick up a Red Box movie... and just stay home!

They do not put Arugula on everything btw - goofy comments, what can you do lol."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in AZ! Favorite place to take out of town guests. Make sure you order the Burrata. Best appetizer that will be inhaled. Perfect blend of fresh homemade mozzarella, prosciutto, balsamic vinegar and toasted bread. The pizza is second to none. There can be a little wait, but just grab a glass of wine and relax on the patio."}
{"text":"Oooo, I feel like I am cheating on Cibo #YEG by writing this review... But as I discovered, the Calgary Cibo is a very different format and style then my beloved Cibo in Edmonton.

Large, full of laughter and low key; that's what Cibo, South, on 17th ave is all about! Where home made, in-house delicacies in an intimate setting are in store for you up North when you go to Cibo, the Calgary namesake (which are not affiliated with each other) is much larger and kicked back. It is housed in a renovated Rodgers Video location, the pizzas are incredible and most definitely the star of the show. The patio is a 3 tiered hidden garden right along the famed ave, but fenced in for privacy. The inside is expansive, open concept with a large bar in the lounge and a ton of seating. This is a place to grab beer and pizza, some cocktails or wine. It would make for a fun evening out that doesn't include clubbing but still comes with a hangover in the morning... Or a perfect place to sit the next afternoon, when you do! 

Alberta's culinary scene rocks, and whether you are in the Capital or Cowtown, Cibo is a definite for awesome eats!"}
{"text":"Calamari - way too chewy and inconsistent- overpriced. Contina sandwich is okay. Crepe overpriced.  i dont understand the high ratings . will not be back"}
{"text":"Good food and friendly staff. The location is great as is the set up. The cooks are accommodating and the service is fairly quick."}
{"text":"Came here again with my husband and another couple. We made a reservation for 9:30pm on Saturday and the place was packed! Always a good sign! We wanted to sit upstairs so we waited at the bar until a table for four was available. There were a few large parties upstairs and it was loud - which we like! The one disappointing thing is that they were out of two items we all really wanted to order. One was the polenta fries and the other was the burrata. I hope they stock extra of those ingredients in the future as they are super popular!
We ordered lots of different things to try. Being a vegetarian this isn't the most veggie friendly place but they certainly made accommodations for me. For example, I ordered the salt roasted beets it usually comes on a board but I asked if they could add extra greens and put it in a bowl like a salad. It was really good! 
We ordered:
Frog Legs  - the guys LOVED these - a definite order!
Lamb Stuffed Calamari $16 - sounds so crazy but it was actually calamari stuffed with lamb (3 pieces)
Salt Roasted Beets $9 - made into a salad :)
Lamb Meatballs $14
Devilled Eggs $8 (2 eggs cut in half for 4 pieces)
Roasted Cauliflower $12 - it was a lot of cheese - probably wouldn't order again
Wild Boar Bacon Pizza $22 - a favourite for the meat eaters
Pear & Gorgonzola Pizza $18

it was my gf birthday so we ordered her the Nutella Calzone and it was SUPER yummy!! 

If you're on 17th on a Saturday night - def a great place to try! Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"My bf went to CIBO after hearing about it from one of our Phoenix-Native friends. We LOVED it! I read the reviews about it before we went to I was super excited to go. We went for an early dinner arriving at 545pm and it was already pretty full. After sitting for a bit we noticed a bunch of ppl sitting outside waiting for a table. This place gets packed! We sat outside to the left beside the big tree with white lights- super nice! Underneath a heat lamp (my fav). The reviews are true, it was super yum! The only thing that was not the best was the service. Our waitress was a little out of it - she started off weird but after we order a bottle of wine and apps she warmed up. We started with a bottle of Scarpetta Pinot Grigio, Trentino Italy. The wine menu online is different. It was $30 and tasted good. We started with the Burrata - fresh mozzarella with a creamy heart topped with balsamic glaze served with black label prosciutto crucio and toasted bread ($14) I loveddddd the mozzarella - talk about quality mozzarella! I didn't eat the prosciutto b/c im a vegetarian but my bf said it was tasty! There are 2 balls of mozzarella and they are big! We got another order of bread - warmed not toasted which tasted even better than the toasted. The waitress was very eager to bring us more bread and she warmed up and was helpful at this point. We both wanted pizza and salad so we decided to share Omero Salad ($12 - organic mixed greens topped w/imported goat cheese, cucumbers, onions, caramelized walnuts and sliced strawberries, tossed with balsamic vinaigrette. We got the dressing on the side which was a good idea b/c it was strong! It was a really really good salad  - moderate size nothing huge but nothing small. For the pizza we got La Noce off the PIzze Rosse (they have half Rosse pizza, with tomato sauce, and half Pizze Biache without tomato sauce). SUPER yummy and a big size! It had tomato sauce, mozzarella and ricotta, topped with arugula and walnuts after pizza is cooked. I loved it! I wanted to order the Fresca Crepe since most of the tables around us had it and I read it was amazing but I literally could not take another bite! Which is off got me b/c i love food hehehe
Def will come back and def try the Fresca dessert!!!"}
{"text":"For some reason I thought I had already reviewed this place and after my recent experience I needed to update my review.  Well, it turns out I did not actually review it the first time.  I've decided to use phrases that I heard constantly on my report cards as I was growing up.

My original visit was not so great.  The service was really blah and despite us ordering a shit ton of alcohol (I know, I know, a common theme in my reviews, I swear I don't have a problem), the server was not at all attentive.  Overall, I could sum up my original experience as a report card: Fails to reach it's full potential.

Cue up my most recent visit which took place at 4.15pm on a Thursday under the advice of my friend who said I would LOVE the deals.  (I really really like a deal!)  

Pizza - $5
Wine - $5

The pizza was freakin' amazing and the WINE WAS $5!  Report card review: Solid improvement.  

Now, I have a problem.  The pizza was so amazing that I can't stop thinking about it.  I almost stopped there today by myself and paid full price to drink wine and eat pizza on my own.  Report card review on my obvious pizza/wine issues: Heather tends to focus on one thing to the exclusion of getting her work done.  

Bottom line - Give them a try during Happy Hour (M-F, 3-5pm) where pizzas are $5 and WINE IS $5.  If you like it, perhaps I'll see you there soon as we both order pizza and wine by ourselves."}
{"text":"Great pizza. One of the best pizzas joints in town. Family friendly, friendly staff, fantastic priced specials. Mushroom pizza is my favourite."}
{"text":"The food is not bad. Everything is to share which is annoying because people disagree with things they wanna eat so it could take a while to figure out the menu.   its extremely overpriced. 4 of us spent 200 dollars on a very average meal and left starving. I would not go back or recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Pizza in Phoenix. Not cheap but worth the price. Especially fun to sit outside in the evening when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try Cibo after reading many great reviews. However, after visiting...I have come to the conclusion that when you have Pizzeria Bianco/Pane Bianco in town, there is no reason to break from perfection.

The Pizza: WAY TOO MUCH CHEESE. Dough: WAY TOO DOUGHY.

 I was pulling the cheese off into huge glops with my fork. We didn't finish our pizza, nor did we want to take it home. 

Hopefully, they were having an 'off' night."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a meal before going to the nearby theater. Owner was very friendly and they were able to get us through the meal in less than hour--so we made the movie!

BYOB, allergy friendly and with wonderful French-press coffee. Everything put on the table was excellent.

However, this is a 4 start experience than a 5 star because the portions were tiny. Think $22 for a Vongole pasta dish which had, at most 3 ounces of pasta. Tasty by every measure, but it was about $2 per fork full of pasta.

All the salads were were exceptionally good, but a bit on the smaller side.

Again, great simple food--just not enough of it at these prices. I would, however, visit again."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is amazing, service is top notch and the atmosphere is perfect."}
{"text":"We went for our anniversary - great experience. Very good appetizers, salads and pizza.  There is no pasta on the menu except on Tuesdays & Wednesdays when they make it in house. Looking forward to going back"}
{"text":"Delicious! Definitely go for something you can't get at a typical pizzeria, because it will be well worth it.

For an appetizer we got the meatballs, which were HUGE. We polished those off pretty quickly thought because they were tasty paired with the grilled bread they came with (I wish I would've asked for extra bread though...) 

For pizza we got the Tartufata, and it was a dream! That truffle oil is haunting, and the cheese was (while I prefer MORE cheese) melty and perfect.

We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"(Pronounced chee-boh) - Unique pizzas, calzones and salads...and a dessert menu that is 95% Nutella...Yummo!  A beautifully lit patio for dining, which we very much enjoyed this time of year!

I had the Procida pizze bianche...Mozzarella, prosciutto, Asian pears, arugula, and goat cheese.  Paired with a Pecorino white wine, it was a melody of flavors in my mouth!  I wish I could've eaten the whole thing in one sitting, but you get a lot for the money and I had to take half to go.

Why four stars and not five?  Service was not bad, but not impeccable either.  Parking isn't that great and it's a small place.  However, I don't know about you, but I go to a place for food and service...not available parking.  ;-)

I will definitely go back...especially because I didn't have room for dessert!  Maybe I'll start with that next time..."}
{"text":"I'm giving a 3/5 review because we had a great time its a fun place! beautiful terrace and good staff ! my only disappointment was the flavor.I was expecting to be the best because of the reviews and the photos, it wasn't memorable let me put it this way!The distribution of the  veggies on the pizza was clustered. An even distribution of the vegetable allow you to appreciated all the flavor.  Big story but this is a place that has a lot of potential and I am happy to see an  happy local business thriving!"}
{"text":"Lovely little authentic Italian Eatery with beautiful patio dining when weather appropriate.  Our server knew the menu and wines very well.  The salads and pizzas were a bit larger than single serving size.  Two people could easily spit a salad and pizza.  Everyone at our table enjoyed their meals which included salads, homemade pasta and pizza.  Not advertised on their website or menu is the fact that they make a simply wonderful GLUTEN FREE pizza crust which you can ask for.  The parking lot is small, but there is street parking available though it could be a bit challenging during busy hours."}
{"text":"CIBO IS THE BEST IN PHX. Hands down. My absolute fave place to eat with my boyfriend. We ate here for the first time at our junior prom and 4 years later it's still just as special. Pretty much everything on the menu is amazing. My favorite pizza (which is pictured) is the margherita + Italian sausage. Today we weren't feeling dessert (super rare because it's soooooo good) but usually we also have the Fresa. Trust me, get it. It's amazing. Aside from the delicious food, the service is always on point despite how busy it may be. Everyone is super friendly, welcoming and it really feels like you're at home when you come here! Cibo is certainly a gem in the heart of Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"This little gem in downtown phoenix is easy to overlook. Located in what appears to be another house in a residential area but is actually a quiet Italian restaurant. The place is nestled behind a row of trees that afford some privacy for the patio diners. 
The menu is mostly comprised of pizzas but it offers a wide selection of both red and white sauce varieties.  There is also a decent selection of salads to accompany your meal.  Tonight I shared a salad with goat cheese strawberries and cartelized walnuts. Very delicious combination.  For dinner I had a red sauce pizza with artichokes, prosciutto and olives(whole). Quite a scrumptious flavor explosion. I didn't sample the desert menu which is made up of crepes of various flavors, although most of them entail Nutella. 
The servers were extreme knowledgeable about the menu and provided excellent service.  Although I have to admit that the service was a little slow at the end. Overall this was a great place to spend a dinner with friends and celebrate a birthday."}
{"text":"Great pizza and crepes! The interior and art is kind of outdated and strange but service and food was pretty good. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We came here with a very large group and they were very accommodating. We tried the calamari and tartufata pizza. Both were delicious. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Frogs legs were great and the wine was good.  They put us in a terrible spot at first but with a little prodding we were moved to a great table."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere.  BYOB was a nice option, but the unlisted $7.00 corking fee was a surprise (in Regent Square).  Food was excellent (menu changes daily), but I feel like they're trying to over do it with the attempt to \"upscale\". We'll be back but will probably only bring one bottle or just go out after."}
{"text":"I have been to Cibo twice in the past two months. Both times the service has been friendly and well timed. However, the food leaves much to be desired. 

The first visit, I was with one friend and we order two appetizers,  a pasta, a pizza, and two desserts. We ordered the arancini and a trio of scodellina (bruschetta, golden beets, buffalo mozzarella). The arancini had good texture but lacked in flavor. The beets were the highlight of the trio, the mozzarella was OK but nothing special, and I would not order the bruschetta again. The bread pieces that come with the scodellina seem to be store bought, the kind you get from the grocery store deli in a cardboard box.

We ordered the farfalle as our pasta because we heard it was the best pasta. Disappointed does not begin to describe it. If you went to the grocery store and bought some pre made rotisserie chicken, a jar of pesto, and a box of farfalle , it would probably taste the same. The biggest disappointment was that the pasta was so clearly not house made and mass produced, and over cooked. Doesn't matter how much cheese you put on it, you can't hide subpar. 

The pizza was slightly better but not by much. We ordered the pineapple, again, best reviews. You would think that you could actually taste the pineapple since it was the name sake, apparently not. Upside is the crust is tasty and cooked well.

At the end of this meal, we were not planning on returning again, but we decided to order some desserts and drinks because our conversation was not over. Best idea ever. My friend ordered the goat cheese panna cotta (she thought it was phenomenal) and I ordered the zeppole (mouth wateringly delicious).

The dessert is why I returned with friends a second time, on a Friday night. The plan was a late night meeting of drinks and dessert. However due to our busy schedules, we were more  hungry then planned so we decided to order some appetizers. Again we did scodellina (prosciutto melon, beets, and eggplant) and arancini. Congrats on being consistent- will not order the arancini a third time, if I return again. The selection of scodellina this time was better, but bread pieces were still from a box.

For dessert we ordered the tiramisu, coconut panna cotta, and red velvet cake. The panna cotta was light and flavorful, the cake was dry and not exceptional, and the tiramisu ok but could have a stronger flavor.

If you want good service and nice atmosphere,  come here. If you want good and quality food, try somewhere else...or just have the panna cotta and zeppoles."}
{"text":"Yelp has been on a roll lately, with all the best foods I've been eating, I've become a food snob. This place is nothing short of spectacular. Great outdoor seating, sitting outside right when the sun is going down in the warm breeze and eating great food. Appetizer of bread, meat and cheese, delicious and light pizza, a glass of wine and top it off with strawberry-nutella crepe = perfect meal."}
{"text":"Really worth the wait.   Salads and crapes were the best!  I will be back.  Service was a bit slow but we dined outside and the weather was perfect."}
{"text":"Being gluten-free it's great to be able to sit and actually eat a meal with friends, versus eating at home prior to going out. (Yes, for health reasons, I am that guy). I ordered the gluten-free Procida pizza and it was great - however I'm getting the Diavola pizza next time. After dinner I had a gluten-free crepe. IT WAS HEAVEN ON A PLATE! Back at home, I waited to see if there was any hint of intestinal discomfort from my food allergy - NONE!!! I will most definitely be coming back. Great food. Great Service. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Food was great! The staff was amazing! I proposed here and the staff made sure it was a perfect night! Thanks again!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and awesome food! It's not that fancy food, but you feel like home having dinner there."}
{"text":"The dinner was delicious and I could really taste that wood burning oven in my food which I absolutely loved! The \"Fresca\" dessert was so light, fresh and filling that I wish I had just ordered that deliciousness for dinner. There was a live singer/guitar player and the outside atmosphere was cute. We sat on the patio and there were christmas lights hanging throughout the trees and it was very pretty lit up at night."}
{"text":"Great Pizzas and a phenomenal cous cous salad! Good service and a cool outdoor patio. It is located inside a converted house, which makes it very homey and comfortable."}
{"text":"This is our favorite spot when we come to town.  The Ostia salad we could eat twice a day with these amazing fried parsnip bits, the pesto salad is equally amazing, and the truffle pizza is incredible.  Wait staff is perfect. 

The outdoor ambiance is the most pleasant and it's great for conversation with your favorite date - it's romantic, private feeling, with lights in the trees in the garden, the best food, and always a really good musician.  We go almost every day that we are in town for business, we just can't get enough."}
{"text":"Went in and it was happy hour so ordered a mix of various appetizers and waited until they were done before ordering a pizza. I don't remember what everything was and their online menu doesn't seem to show it, but there were these chewy pieces of dough served with fresh basil, and tomato sauce, a rice ball stuffed with mozzarella and meatballs with crusty bread. All of it was outstanding. Not wanting to leave without trying a pizza, I ordered a margherita pizza and it was excellent. Check this place out, it's very good and services was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Not too long of a wait.  Super cute little renovated bungalow downtown.  Pizza crust was thin and chewy.  We got the white pizza with mushrooms, prosciutto, and truffle oil and the salami pizza with spicy marinara and both were very good."}
{"text":"Love this place.. awesome, awesome outdoor patio.. cool live music on the weekends... I love the diavla w ricotta pizza.. awesome crepes. The ambiance is  unmatched the food seems authentic and fresh. Def a nice spot for people visiting, w a couple of the girls, or a romantic night for two. For a busy place, I always seem to get seated pretty quickly as well :)"}
{"text":"Cibo = Yumminess!!  Plain and simple!!  the ambiance is awesome and the food doesn't disappoint!!  I've always received great service here, and the staff is great at suggesting items that I probably wouldn't have tried, but will reorder again and again!  The patio is awesome!  Take advantage of it while you still can :)"}
{"text":"Keeping this short and sweet. Some of the best Pizza you can have in the U.S.A. Simply amazing. Go for the Margharita!! Just Go,Go, Go! You will NOT regret it."}
{"text":"I hardly ever get downtown for lunch and had no idea where to go, so I sent out a tweet. A couple people independently suggested Cibo, so we met friends there. The place is very a charming, a converted house with brick wall, chandeliers, and cool art. 

They serve sandwiches and salads at lunch time. I got the pastrami and mostly enjoyed it. It was actually a little too rich with the fontina for my liking, but overall pretty good. The bread was toasty and incredible. 

The staff was great- nice, genuine and friendly. I love when servers know how to strike the balance of being attentive while giving you time to talk with your company.

Last, but best, we ordered dessert crepes. This is where the 5th star comes in- oh my freaking god. We got a suzette which has orange marmalde folded in and is topped with gran marnier which they light at the table. We also got one stuffed with warm nutella and topped with powedered sugar. It was absolute freaking ecstasy on a plate. Let me tell you- if you ever have a hot date, or an apology to make, do it over wine and dessert crepes at Cibo."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I have been here several times and it's always a favorite.  The food is awesome and the atmosphere is top notch.  Definitely score points on an early date by going here.

Only downside is the wait, but if you know that going into it, it's no big deal.  We grabbed a bottle of wine and sat by their fire pit to kill the time.

We actually had a group of six people.  3 pizzas, 3 salads, a desert crepe (we destroyed it), a few cups of coffee and we walked out of there for $17 a head for the meal.  Well worth it."}
{"text":"It took me way too long to make it here.  Many years ago I was at an event where Cibo was sampling food along with many other restaurants.  They were hands down the best food I had at that event.  I took their information and planned to go there for a full meal and never did.  
I am so disappointed in myself that it took so long to get here.  I took my boss here for lunch on a beautiful Phoenix day.  It would have been great to eat outside, but we opted for inside instead.  It's an old downtown house converted, like so many awesome places downtown, into a restaurant.  It's cozy and unpretentious.  A+ for atmosphere.
Just an fyi, during lunch, pizza is not served.  That just means I have to come back for dinner.  (Hopefully it won't take me another 5 years to do that).  At lunch, their delicious sandwiches and salads are available.  If you're not with your boss, you can also get a glass of pinot noir or chardonnay for $3.  I got a delicious lemonade and found a breakfast sandwich on the menu:  eggs, spinach, and ricotta on wood fired bread.  So good.  I got the fruit salad as my side which was yogurt, granola, and fruit.  My lunch ended up being two items I make myself for breakfast all the time, but elevated to gourmet deliciousness.  I can only strive to make my breakfast or lunch this great.  My boss got the pastrami sandwich and fruit salad and thanked me for bringing me here.
Looking at the reviews, I need to come back for dinner, brunch, and dessert.  I can't wait and definitely won't."}
{"text":"service started rough when we were given dirty plates for our entree, service continued to be slow throughout the meal, our waiter came over once we had finished our meal to give us more water which we had been out of since our entree. overall poor service and overpriced food"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Cibo tonight for dinner.  We got the bruschetta, the Vegetariana pizza, and then the Fresca (crepe filled with fruit, and topped with more fruit) for desert.  

Since we shared everything, the proportions, except for the dessert, were perfect.  The dessert was a little large, but very delicious.  The fruit especially tasted fresh.

The pizza was good, though there were many spots the cheese didn't cover.  It was hardly a problem however, as the crust is extremely flavorful.  The vegetable toppings were cooked to perfection.

The bruschetta was good, though I'm not too sure about the beans.  It's a personal preference, but it was just too many beans.  The tomato was very good.

The inside and outside of the place is nice, though the neighborhood seems kind of sketchy.  The music inside the restaurant was...interesting.  Both of those can be dealt with though, as the food (and service!) is worth it."}
{"text":"We went to Cibo for dinner and it was such a lovely experience. We decided to dine outside and it was really lovely. There was live music and the lights were really pretty. We ordered Pizza and Pasta that our waitress recommended. It was really awesome! The portion was generous and price was reasonable. This place is perfect for a date night or family dinner time. This place is located near Downtown (walking district from main downtown) and definitely a must visit place when you are visiting Downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Tried again because 2 people in our group insisted on trying it. Sat outside as a party of 6. Birthday for 2 of the people.

Its OK. The pizza that has pears and arugula on it was good the very first time we went but this time was just LOADED with arugula and they put it on right before bringing it out vs right after it came out of the oven. So it never wilted. The pizza just didn't seem very fresh and was fairly dry.

We also had the antipasto and it was fairly lackluster with unripened olives all over. Huge ratio of olives to everything else. A bit stingy with the meat.

Service was sterile. Still not sure who our server was. We probably had 3-4 diff people come by from time to time. Had to get up and find someone to ask for a check. Being seated outside here you really feel like you're fairly forgotten about.

Hopefully won't be back. Too many better offerings now in the valley for pizza."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Meatball sandwich is my fav! I have not had pizza there- I think it is served for dinner only, but I hear it is good. Cozy atmosphere for dining inside or out. Minus one star for lack of parking."}
{"text":"Were in the neighborhood one weeknight and popped in for a 'snack'  For a Wed night this place was jammin'! We didn't feel like waiting for a table so we got lucky and squeezed ourselves into the bar to grab a pie.  Our server/bartender was very sweet.  We got a sausage  pizza and it was decent.  It has a thin crust (which we loove) but it just seems to lack in flavor a little bit.  The crust is a little soggy towards the middle.  I still prefer Pomo's pizza, but for the downtown hipster atmosphere and people watching, this is a fun place to sit down and throw back a few glasses of wine.  Old, but charming :)"}
{"text":"This is the Antonio Banderas in Desperado of Pizzerias."}
{"text":"I will join the troves of people writing reviews for Cibo.  By now, it's known that it one of the best places to eat in Phoenix.  

Cibo's atmosphere is the best by far.  Inside the \"house\" is quaint, and intimate.  Perfect for a romantic date for two.  The outside patio is lit well with stringed bulbs, great landscaping and the occasional live music.

The pizza is on par with Bianco.  I recommend getting a pie per person so you can try a variety.  Also, I usually prefer red pizzas, but the whites here at Cibo always end up being my favorite.

The crepe deserts, with fresh fruit and ice cream are beyond words.  Save room, you must get it.

I love brining out of towners here to show what Phoenix really has to offer.  Not some chain restaurant in a strip mall."}
{"text":"Cibo has always been a spot I've recommended from hearing word of mouth, but I had never previously been.

With my dad in town I decided to give it a shot.

The food was very very good. I don't know how they do it but everything we ate was full of taste and absolutely delicious. 

However (And I'd like to hear a response from Cibo on this..) was what in the world was the hostess/wait staff thinking?!  I had not seen my dad in almost a year and with him in town we wanted to catch up, we went to Cibo early so we would have time to talk/catch up etc.. The restaurant was empty. Patio & bars were full.  We were seated in the restaurant pretty much by ourselves, exactly what we wanted. 

About 10 minutes after being seated the waitstaff sat a table of 4 directly (as in within arms length) beside us..  in a completely empty restaurant. It was in the back seating area so I was sharing a booth seat with these people..  I wouldn't have an issue with this if it was busy.. but myself my dad and the table of 4 were the only people in the place.   Both parties could easily tell the awkwardness of the situation.  No background music, no background chatter just our two tables as if we were one. AWKWARD."}
{"text":"Can't  beat the burger and truffle fries with parmesan, and the happy hour pizzas. My fav is boar bacon fennel sausage. It is the best deal in Calgary! I go here a lot and it is always great."}
{"text":"I really liked this place!!.. I had the 5 samples of appetizers and they were big enough that we didn't order anything else to eat!!.. The service was very good and the wine too!!.. Also, the atmosphere was very nice!.. But the best part is the bill!!.. This place is one of the most inexpensive places I have been in Calgary!!.. I definitely recommend this place if you want to go with a group of friends or if you do not want to spend so much money and have a good time!!.."}
{"text":"Fun menu with interesting selections and some standbys. Recommend outdoor seating on a cool afternoon."}
{"text":"Very very good Margherita. Other pizzas I have tried were good as well except the Quattro Formaggi which was quite bland. Nice atmosphere, too."}
{"text":"Late night running around Phoenix wanted to get meal and found this place still buzzing late night.  We stopped in, it was a little cool, so we sat inside, and service was excellent.  

We started with an Antipasto Speciale - a mixed dish with prosciutto crudo,bresaola with arugula and parmigiano, roasted red peppers with black
olives and capers, Cipolle di Rosa, fresh mozzarella and grape tomatoes served with a fantasy of olives.  This was one of the best antipasto dishes, we fought over who got the last bite.

Next we ordered a pizza, my husband had done his homework and read the reviews, so we decided to try the Di Notte - fontina, pecorino, gorgonzola, mozzarella and spicy salame, thin crust, good texture, flavors were different, we ate it all.

And finally for desert we had to try the neutela crepes, we got two, a warm crepe filled with nutella and sprinkled with powdered sugar and chocolate sauce and the Nutella and Banana - a warm crepe filled with nutella and sliced banana, topped with powdered sugar and chocolate sauce.  These were a great end to a good meal."}
{"text":"The white pizzas are amazing! The red sauce is a little watery but everything else is perfect."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix for a meeting and came here with a co-worker.  We ordered the pesto salad and funghi pizza.  Since it was a cooler evening, we sat outside on the patio.
The salad had chunks of parmigiano reggiano, roasted potatoes with greens covered in delicious pesto.  It was a winning start to the dinner.
The funghi pizza was charred well and was not bitter.  The crust was very good but a little watery from the mushroom.  However, the pie was very good.
The service was prompt, polite and friendly.
I really enjoyed this place and when I'm back in town with the family, I am definitely taking them."}
{"text":"Have only done happy hours there recently and our go to items are the house red, gnocchi, arancini and pizza dough slices...the average ranking is for the spotty service. First no happy hour menu, taking forever for drink refills, list goes on. Especially when  it's 3pm and there are two tables inside."}
{"text":"Two words: Amazing crust. I went to Cibo tonight with a friend for dinner. Great service and great food! We shared the Salsiccia con Patate (sausage and potato) and the La Noce (red sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, arugula, and walnuts).... both were delicious! Wish we could have saved room for a nutella and banana crepe, but the pizza was just too good to stop. Can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"WOW! Great place to relax and have some good food! My new Favorite in Phoenix for Italian! Great Salads! Great Wine!"}
{"text":"I'm glad they got over themselves and started serving pizza at lunch, because it's delicious.  But I'll tell you what:  Their barbecued pork sandwich is delicious, and better than any barbecue place in town. They also make their own Limoncello and it's fantastic.  The location is good, and when the weather is nice their extensive, tree-filled patio is a really nice place to spend some time."}
{"text":"Say it with me \"Cheee-bow\", now you've got it. Chris Bianco had better stay on his side of Central because Cibo is bringing some serious wood-fired heat with their two-person pizza kitchen stashed away in a restored home on the corner of Fillmore and 5th Ave. Lunch and dinner only here (for breakfast pizza, check out Pie-sano's) in a unique pizzeria that makes me feel like I'm eating at home. The pizza is cooked up in a wood burning oven (like Bianco's) so expect that same taste. They are smaller, typically for two people, and can range from a classic white pizza to the strangest concoction your mind can dream up. The seating is limited and there is a crowd perpetually from 11am to 10pm. Don't even try on First Fridays or Suns game nights. Cibo is out of the way but easy to access from 7th Ave. Parking is limited and only getting worse. Be careful crossing the street, the corner is dark and I drive fast."}
{"text":"Probably don't have more to add other then AWESOME!
Went with a friend for lunch and was so pleased. Been waiting to go for a couple of years, but living in way north valley, wasn't convenient.
So happy I had the opportunity! It was great."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love the food here and I go very often! I have been going here for years and always recommend it to friends and family. I also Order through post mates when I don't feel like going out. 

The reason I am updating my review is because of my recent visit here over the weekend. My husband and I decided to go here for dinner this last Friday night to have a relaxing evening and to enjoy some great food. We wanted to sit out side because the weather was amazing and they have a great ambiance outside. When we got there we asked the hostess to be sat outside and I pointed to a table that I wanted to sit at because it was close to a heater and in the corner. I'm all about ambiance and felt this was an ideal table to sit at. I understand that sometimes hostesses cannot put people in certain sections because they don't want to give some waitresses more people over others etc. when I pointed out the table, the blonde hostess was extremely rude and said \"no, actually, you're going to sit over here, we already double sat over there\". I would have waited until a spot opened in that area, but she didn't give any options. We were shocked she was so rude and went to Pomo instead, which was a good choice, because we always neglect Pomo and forgot about it. We never walk out of restaurants, but this time we had to. The second we walked in Pomo, the manager told us to pick a seat, any seat, which was ironic. 

Good food, bad service. No one wants to go to dinner and be treated that way. Especially when you support their business often and encourage others to do the same."}
{"text":"I can't believe no one has talked about Pasta Tuesday. Definitely the best time to go but make sure you get there early because the pasta literally runs out. It is that good. They have this guy (Guido) come every Tuesday and he starts making hand made pasta early in the morning. He picks 2 unique dishes. It was one of the best pasta I have EVER tasted. I crave it all the time. I had a fettucini noodle in a alfredo creme sauce with herbs and pine nuts on top. I can't even describe the taste (wow what a good food critic i am). You just have to go check it out. I am going TONIGHT!"}
{"text":"You know how you have high expectations of a place. You've even been, but the wait was too long for you at the time. The reviews are off the wall and all your friends love it...but then...you go and are disappointed???

THIS IS SO NOT THE CASE. Cibo was a start for our fabulous evening downtown on my farewelll Phoenix tour (LOL!). We had dinner here before the Madonna concert and it was Fanfreakintastic! 

The place was humming with regulars and plenty of Madonna fans. Weather was perfect for al fresco dining. We sat comfortably at a table in back with impeccable service by a new server named Kim. She rocked our meats and cheeses. 

Literally. We ordered the appetizer of meat, cheeses, nuts and fruit. For $19 it was really a steal and fed us four Madonna fans well. The homemade mozzeralla was TDF...the proscuitto, bread, olives, goat cheese, grilled veggies...MOUTHGASM!

Of course we had to have a pizza and the Margherita pizza sang to us!!! Crust was perfection, pillowy and crunchy with the soft cheese, tangy sauce and fresh basil. 

We were indeed doing the happy food dance. Which was a great excercise as we danced our tails off several hours later. So the food was much needed fuel. 

Ambience was as charming as everyone has mentioned. 

Cibo. First date. I will squeeze in another if you'll have me. Maybe I'll even kiss you good night and good bye!"}
{"text":"Wow where do I begin.  I guess this is top dog for Phoenix but in the realm of pizza in general it rates up there with a strip mall no name pizza joint.  I am going to start with the dessert menu.  Really - every dessert is served with Nutella?  There wasn't one faux authentic Italian dessert on the menu.  Coffee - regular coffee that was exactly like the coffee I had in a hospital cafeteria.  I asked if they had cream for the coffee and I was told \"Yes, we have half/half.\"  It was liquid Coffee Mate? Uh, that is not half/half.  While I wait let me give you \"our cold stale bread\" served without anything not even butter.  We had the Latina pizza and the tomato on the pizza was not even ripe nor near the color red and it was cold dropped on the pizza like a wet noodle.  I bit into a piece of rosemary and felt like I was immersed in a Vicks Vaporub mozzarella pizza.  If this place is owned by a native Italian he/she would be the laughing stock of his former Italian neighborhood.  

Hang on... I didn't taste any of the wine.  You might be redeemed with a decent selection of Chianti but I can't imagine this is possible.  

Wait wait wait.... the actual restaurant is very quaint in appearance."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Phoenix, and probably my favorite pizza I've ever had. The quality of food here is excellent! Love the 4 cheese pizza and the crepes are amazing as well.

The ambiance is romantic, relaxed and really gorgeous at night. Love cibo!"}
{"text":"love loveee loveeeee loveeee loveeeeeee loveeee.

I've been here more than ten times. I absolutely love everything about this place. The atmosphere,  the people, the vibe I get. I just love it here. And who doesn't like it when someone is singing and playing the guitar while you wine and dineeee? So romantic and just perfect. 

Its my favorite place for pizza and wine. yummmmm.

I come every day if I can. Haha"}
{"text":"Went for dinner before a Suns game on a Tuesday, got there at 5 and got right in, but the place filled up fast after us.  The atmosphere is awesome, a little brick house split into small rooms with a huge patio dining area.  The service was quality over all.  Very attentive at the beginning, forgot about us throughout the meal but showed up again at the check/dessert time.  We had the Burrata with proscuitto for an app., which was awesome, melt in your mouth, almost sweet cheese, and the proscuitto was like pork butter, lovely.  The pizzas were good but not what i expected when i hear thin crust.  The ingredients were definately quality but the crust was a little fluffy and chewy for my taste.  Bianco still tops the charts on pizza, but for the lack of wait, and quality of food, ambiance, and service i would definately recommend Cibo.  I plan on going back to try some more selections."}
{"text":"Neapolitan pizza perfected. Food is always consistent and the pizza dough is one of the best around."}
{"text":"GF crust is probably the best I have ever had! I got the Di Notte and added basil and my boyfriend had the Genova and added spicy salami. Very good, we had not had pizza without sauce before. Next time we might try their red sauce pizzas."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing. Hands down the best crepe I have ever had. I would recommend going here for a nice romantic date or a night out with your friends! Great service and amazing food."}
{"text":"OMG!! I'm in love. I've lived in Italy and despite the fact that I was young, the pizza there was to die for. Cibo is authentic Italian thin crust pizza. I want to go everyday just to try everything on the menu. We ordered two pizzas for 2 adults and a tween and the tween devoured damn near a whole pizza by herself. I know to order more next time, but all in all. It was soooo delicious!! My new favorite pizza spot. Thanks cibo."}
{"text":"Quaint atmosphere, amazing food, great wine and service was right up there too!  Nice place to relax before a game or concert down town."}
{"text":"Great for ambience, honesty you can get the same pizza for way less at many of the new fast pizza joints for way less. Seating and service were prompt drinks were good, bruschetta appetizer was great. Menu mostly pizza, some pasta and other dishes. Restored house with multiple dining rooms, like I said, great ambience. Nice place for pre-show dinner. Parking not a problem. 15 minute walk to Comerica."}
{"text":"Daily specials are great value. I had a delicious ravioli dish and the risotto was also very good, each at 13$ and 9$ (half price Mondays!) Large potions. And half priced wine! You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing ... AMAZING.  

I've had about everything on the menu... and not one regret.  The salads are fresh and the ingredients blend well.  The pizzas are baked to perfection.  The crepes are out of this world.... seriously, try the nutella banana crepe!  Easy drive, abundant parking (except for First Fridays), not far from the Light Rail, so very accessible.  The atmosphere is very cozy and inviting.  This is a great place!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out tonight.  Long overdue, but I was glad that I made it down here.  My Yelp buddy Kate and I had planned on coming down here a few weeks ago but it didn't pan out.  Tonight worked though and we met here for some dinner.  I found parking on the street (randomly, right behind their car lol..St. Louis Cardinal fans can smell each others cars I guess) and walked a block down.  The restaurant is really cool.  It's an old converted house which is funky and awesome in it's own way.  Kate and her husband got there before me and grabbed us a table inside. 

I sat down and ordered a Diet Coke to drink.  Kate and her husband had already ordered some appetizers for us (Polpette- Meatballs and Straccetti- Fried pieces of pizza dough topped with tomato sauce and parmigano and basil).  We then placed our order for our pizzas.  Me and Kate decided to split 2 pizzas so we could try out some different things.  We went with a basic Margherita and we also went with a white pizza called the Rustica which came with procsiutto and arugala.  Kates husband ordered the Calzone.  Here is how everything tasted...............

Appetizers:

Polpette-  They serve this dish with 3 meatballs which were topped with some grated cheese and a few slices of crusty bread.  These meatballs were very good!  They were tender and delicious.  The sauce these were in was very tasty too! 

Straccetti-  These come about 9 to a plate.  They are little strips of dough...think, funnel cake/churro bites, but made out of regular dough.  They are topped with their delicious sauce and basil strips.  These were great too!  They seriously reminded me of little churro pieces but without the sugar on them.  Great fried dough and a definite repeat too.  

Pizza/Calzones:

Margherita-  I usually order a plain pizza when I'm trying a new place out.  You can tell a lot about a pizza place just by their cheese pizza.  This rendition was pretty good.  Not as good as some other places in town, but still a tasty pizza.  I liked their sauce, cheese and crust.  I didn't like that they put too much basil on it plus it was cut really odd.  There were like 2 huge gigantic pieces and then 6 real small ones.   It was a tad thin in parts too.  Still, a good pizza but not a \"great\" pizza.

Rustica-  This was a white pizza (olive oil base) topped with prosciutto and arugala after it was cooked.  I didn't like this one nearly as much.  It sounded way better than it tasted.  It tasted like regular ham on pizza plus the arugala threw me off.  I don't need no stinking salad on my pizza!  I never had this kind of pizza before so I'm glad I tried it but wouldn't get it again.  This one was cut irregularly and a bit thin in spots too.

Calzone-  This may have been the best item ordered.  Louie chose well!  This calzone is a huge, football shaped pocket of goodness.  It had a great outer crust and it was stuffed with mozzarella, ricotta, some kind of spicy salame/pepperoni and some other stuff too.  I only had a little sample of it, but I would definitely get it again if I come back.   It was tasty and better than the 2 pizzas we got.

Total bill was ?.  Louie grabbed the check before I could see it.  I threw in some money for a tip, we sat around and talked for a bit and then we were on our way.

Service was very friendly and attentive.  I liked the vibe of the place too.  I could see myself coming back for sure.  The food was like a 3, but the vibe, company I was with,  and the service bring it up to a 4 star joint!"}
{"text":"Great wine, amazing pizza, and one hell of a Nutella crepe. I'm not sure how this could get any better. Wait, it can -- try one of the panini. Seriously, it's a little taste of Italy in downtown Phoenix. Plus, they have valet parking at lunch. A big plus since parking was a big problem at such popular place."}
{"text":"Fun place!  Great food, vibe, etc...Staff is super friendly and attentive to your needs.  Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"deliciousness in a single menu...always dependable good food."}
{"text":"I can't believe it has taken me this long to write a review about Cibo. My friends, family, my husband, and I come there regular especially for their 3pm pizza happy hour. 

We always order the boar bacon pizza and the ham and pineapple pizza cause they are so good. Recently, we were at Cibo for our after wedding family dinner before we went for our vacation and we ordered liver pate and jam, bread for the whole table, procuitto salad, cheese fries, meatballs, ravioli pasta, burger (totally don't remember the name), boar bacon pizza, ham and pineapple pizza, mushroom pizza, nd boar bacon pizza with added egg. Everything tasted great and we really enjoyed our dinner.

I already recommend Cibo to friends and family everytime they want to go for lunch or dinner at a casual sit down and they are craving pizza and pasta. And especially they have such a good deal on pizzas on their happy hour!"}
{"text":"It's been said before, but I'll say it again: Cibo is pretty freakin' awesome. The pizzas are unique, but well-balanced. The toppings are well thought out...they're not throwing a bunch of strange stuff on a pizza just because they can; the flavors really meld well. The crust is chewy but not difficult to eat. My pizza was a tad overdone on the bottom, but it was easily overlooked. They have a good wine selection but I was looking for a local brew since I just moved here and they didn't disappoint there, either. Service was a little slow but super friendly. The patio is absolutely lovely and the funny slumped over tree with twinkling lights is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Great date night spot.  Casual and warm.  Pizza is solid."}

FOOD:
Cibo has elevated my expectations of good pizza. The crust was crisp and the flavor combinations were expert! I had a half and half combination of Diavola and Genova. The Diavola is slightly spicy and though I don't like spice, the flavor was excellent! I highly recommend the Genova pizza! An entirely unique flavor experience! 

SERVICE:
We had a fantastic service team, Yasmin and Brittany were kind and welcoming and had such a genuine approachability. They wanted us to have a great experience and gave us passionate recommendations! They are great! 

ATMOSPHERE:
This place is so warm and inviting! The restaurant is within what used to be a house, it's clean and the tables are well spaced. Patio dining looks great! This could be a great romantic stop."}
{"text":"Great patio and nice beer selection. The pizzas are small but delicious. I could probably eat 2 by myself if I was really hungry."}
{"text":"Simply Awesome food and atmosphere.   Plus the abandonded house about 3 doors down serves as a cat sanctuary .  Love this place and the area."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to check this place out, because from four squares rating, it was very good. The home made pasta isn't served until 5pm. We got there about 4:20pm, so we decided to drink and wait until 5pm. Once 5pm hit we ordered the special for Saturday, and it was fantastic. It's a dryer pasta, but it was delicious!!! I had my moscato that was very tasty also. The ambience is relaxing and almost vintage. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Cibo provided a mixed experience on a Sunday night.  My son enjoyed his pizza, Da Vinci (?), while my DIL was disappointed with her Di Norte.  The child's pizza looked good and was enormous.   My pasta and red sauce was very nice.   Service was good, price point was excellent, and the atmosphere was casual and comfortable.  Sitting outside was lovely. 
 
I looked forward to a Crepe Suzette and introducing my family to this delicacy. The Crepe Suzette was a disaster.  The server couldn't get the syrup to light in order to flamb√©, which destroyed the presentation, in addition to the flavor.  The syrup didn't have the rich fragrance of Grand Marnier, just alcohol, the crepe had marmalade in it instead of the decadent orange, butter syrup, and was a soggy, doughy mess.  My DIL described it has an alcohol soaked tortilla."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try this place out on the advice of a friend. What started off as a 40-minute wait actually ended up being only a 10-min wait. We started with a meat and cheese board, then a house salad and finished it off with a sausage and prosciutto pizza. Everything was delicious and satisfying. We will definitely be coming back very soon."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's very quaint as it is a house converted into a restaurant. We sat outside but didn't realize that there had been construction being done on the street. At times it was so loud we just didn't bother to try and repeat what we had said. The other thing was the offensive smell! The dumpster sits right by the parking lot of the restaurant and if you sit outside you get a disgusting whiff of it every once in a while. Very unappetizing. 

The food itself is delicious! I got the mele salad which has caramelized walnuts, blue cheese, and apple slices. The dressing perfectly complimented the other ingredients. The pizza was had a delicious crust and ooey gooey cheese. One of the better specialty pizzas I've had. 


Definitely would go back and have!"}
{"text":"Always SO SO good! It only took me six or seven years, but I finally ate there on a pasta night and it was just as awesome as I expected! 

Favorite place to eat for all occasions, and for any meal- especially brunch, which I could eat for every meal if possible."}
{"text":"I like Cibo better than Bianco as a restaurant, but Chris's pie is still better by a nose. Cibo has bad parking, nice ambience, spotty service, good menu, fresh, high quality ingredients, and good value. Translates to hit the off hours, get a pie, order the antipasto, and have a Nutella desert"}
{"text":"I am quite disappointed after reading all my friends brag about this place. I brought my now wife last Valentine's Day here and we showed up a little early before they opened and bottles and glasses that were left out from the night before. So we came back and there was a line, which isn't bad but we got sat right under the tree. We ordered a  salad that was had pear's as the main ingredient and there weren't many pears and dabs of honey. Just thought it was a little cheap. 
Then the pizza, there wasn't much cheese on there and the ingredients seem to be again cheap. The dessert seemed to be the same way.
Finally when the waitress brought our check and came back with the change she said she didn't have time to get us the change so we could add that into the tip. So she shorted us .40 some cents.
I will try this place again given the reviews and telling my friends about my experience, will probably sit inside."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a casual environment. 

Patio dining at its best at Cibo's.

However, I tend to go on their off hours/days to beat the rush."}
{"text":"Really awesome spot. The food was killer! 

We started with the Antipasto Speciale (large), which was the perfect amount for four of us. 

For pizza, they'll let you do half and half, so each of the four of us picked out a pizza and then got to try one slice of each kind that we ordered. Super yummy. My fav was the Capricciosa while boyfriend was obsessed with the Salsiccia Con Patate.

We couldn't resist the dessert crepes and split two orders between the four of us. They're pretty large, so we didn't have to fight over the last bite. :) Nutella and mascarpone tasted like hot chocolate crepes (holy moly), and the fruit and mascarpone were yummy as well.

The ambiance is so cute and would be a perfect first date spot. Cute and kinda romantic without overdoing it!"}
{"text":"Just had a veggie + salami pizza...   might literally be the BEST  I have ever had....  *seriously*"}
{"text":"Order the burrata you will not be disappointed.  I love spice so my favorite pizza at Cibo is the Diavola with fungi.  The garden dining is a plus with twinkle lights and lots of trees, makes for a romantic setting."}
{"text":"what a great atmosphere! you can't get much better. awesome house with finely curated selection of great music. they played a little bit of everything while I lunched, from indie to classical to jazz; all good. ask the hip staff about good local shows and they'll tell you what to check out around town.

at this point it's worth going just to chill and soak up good music even without considering the food. but the food is pretty good, too. for lunch they have hot and cold pizza-bread sandwiches, crepes and salads. I wasn't able to make it back for a dinner pizza, but I will the next time I'm in phoenix."}
{"text":"So delicious!! Best Pizza I've had in Arizona. And the Burrata was amazing. I'll definitely be coming back here when I'm in the mood for authentic wood fired pizza."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner while visiting Arizona for a weekend! The ambiance was romantic with live music outside. The service and food was great, will definitely come to this restaurant again when back in Arizona."}
{"text":"3.5 stars actually but I rounded up.
I've come to Cibo a few times for client lunches and I always order the pizza. The patio is beautiful and the food is good too... But I wouldn't say it's the best pizza in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We went with a big group and sat outside. They have a perfect outdoor setting. We started with calamari & the big tray of meats and cheese which I loved. We then tried all kinds of different pizza which was all pretty good. I would not say the best pizza I have ever had but pretty good. We got a couple of deserts that were made from crepes which were good as well. Not to die for deserts. Overall great spot. Would go back again."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Cibo! I know it has tons of great reviews but I feel it is time to add my own. In my opinion Cibo is better than Pizzeria Bianco and way less wait. 

This is a great place for sharing. My favorite night at Cibo goes like this...
The delicious pesto salad. ( I am not usually a big salad person but this one is quite interesting.)
Then on to the pizza. I generally get the margherita pizza but had the diavola the other day and now I am hooked.
For desert all of the crepes are amazing.
And if you've never had limoncello I highly recommend you try it!
And of course you can always share a bottle of wine for dinner. 

Great food, reasonable prices and beautiful patio!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Sunday night with my bff. Cibo definitely did not disappoint. I did make reservations due to its popularity, but Sunday night at 7p wasn't busy for a table for 2 on the patio. When we arrived we were asked if we wanted indoor or patio seating. Definitely sit outside, esp if it's nice out. Enjoy the fresh air and the beautiful ambiance. 

We decided to order the Sunday dinner special - lasagna, and the Diavola pizza - red sauce, mozz, spicy salami and definitely add the ricotta cheese for an extra $2. 

I didn't care for the lasagna much since the insides had a lot of veggies (carrots and celery). Yes it is different but I live my meats! 

I did enjoy the pizza very much. I added more chili flakes for an added spice. The spicy salami had a good kick and the added cheese made the pizza really creamy. Delicious. Unfortunately, the crust was soggy with all our toppings. I would have preferred a crunchier crust.

Our service was great and we got good recommendations from our server. Cute \"house\"/restaurant with lots of charm and character. Busy on Sunday night and good home cooked food.

Street parking, but be mindful of the meters and red fire lanes!"}
{"text":"I've been to Cibo about three times in the past two weeks, and hot damn is it ever good! I celebrated my birthday there with a table of thirty, the reservation was smooth, and the place is so big that seating for a party that large is not at all a problem (employees of the former Roger's video probably gape at what the space once was). Several scodellinas later ( the roasted eggplant dip, the date salad, the ricotta, and the aracini are a few of my favourites), we were knee deep in delicious drinks and entrees (great pizza, up there with the quality of Double Zero and Una, and awesome pasta, I recommend the gnocchi). Overall, the ambiance is friendly (family and otherwise), the wait staff are always efficient and seem happy to be serving you (no mute service or servers that are seen once and never again), and the food is top notch Italian, especially for the price. 
Cibo has become my go to place for eating out on 17th, and I hope the quality of the food and service continues to be a steady four stars."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner. Loved everything about it. Especially the atmosphere! Only thing that I didn't like was the food. Ordered pizza and pasta and it wasn't bad but I was expecting more. One word, bland."}
{"text":"Love this classic downtown location! Perfect for a friendly happy hour, quick take-out, visitors from a far, or a romantic date. Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered the Margherita pizza and it was a little undercooked, floppy for my crust preference. However, I had an amazing desert here. The doughballs were amazing so that's why I gave 3 stars."}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem in downtown Phoenix. I love sharing them with new people! A delicious menu, my personal favorite is the calzone. The Nutella and banana crepe is also a MUST, so save room for dessert! Love their outdoor seating, but inside is charming too. They have a nice private eating area too if you have a special event. I will definitely be hosting a rehearsal dinner there when my wedding time comes! It's truly one of the culinary bests in the Phoenix area, I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys good food, wine and company!

The only thing I can say though is that on Friday and Saturday nights, they fill up quickly! But it is definitely worth the wait! And normally you don't wait as long as they quote you :)"}
{"text":"This is a romantic place. Love the atmosphere from the artwork that they posses, to the historical look and outdoor patio with lights. I came here with a friend just to go out and eat. The staff was very friendly and interactive with the customers, enhancing the experience. The pizza here is just fantastic. I am definitely up to coming back soon."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place (thin crust) on earth hands down. Truffle oil.. mmm..."}
{"text":"I will preface this by saying that I went here a couple years ago for lunch and thought it was very good, which gave it an extra star over my true opinion of my dinner there last night.

The BF and I went here before seeing Louis CK for our anniversary. We were seated right away, so that was nice, but it was like 5:45 so that isn't too shocking. We sat outside, which was nice and had pretty christmas lights on all of the trees. The waiter comes by after about 5 minutes and asks us for drinks or apps and we ordered the burrata as an app. The menu said it was topped with a balsamic glaze, which sounded wonderful. We were also ready to order our pizza but the waiter disappeared immediately after taking our app order. So we wait. and wait. and wait. And I swear it felt like it was a half hour, but it was probably more like 10-15 minutes later (we were super hungry) the waiter came back to take our pizza order. We ordered the La Noce and he left. Well.... we waited some more. Finally got our burrata and it was a mess. Two giant globs of cheese with the lightest drizzle of balsamic dressing (not vinegar, because there is no way this weak stuff was straight up vinegar) surrounded by bread and prosciutto. It was large, so I'll give them that.... but too large in my opinion, because there isn't enough bread for the toppings. The burrata was good, creamy.... but it didn't taste like balsamic at all, which was the most appealing part of the app. The prosciutto was alright... it didn't have a ton of flavor, but it was fine. The bread had a burnt flavor... not my fave. Then we wait about 20 minutes.... waiter did not check on us.... Finally get the pizza. The pizza was good. That was the redeeming item of the night. It had arugula, walnut, ricotta, and mozz. It was a tasty combination.

 Now, the whole time we were there, there was a table of about 6-8 extremely loud, drunk, possibly old sorority girls sitting near us. All we could hear is their conversation, so much so, that we knew one girl was named rochelle and one was Tina and one had been divorced for 4 years and they had a friend named Lori who was just sooo crazy among many other details that we should not have gathered from sitting in their proximity, which obviously puts a damper on the experience. The waiter was so occupied with them, that we felt forgotten about all night. He was not attentive, he did not ask how things were, and he disappeared for long periods of time to go do who knows what for this other table (they had a bunch of ridiculous requests like splitting the bill 6-8 ways when the menu says they don't do that... hmmm). We sat down at 5:45 and barely got out of there around 7 to make it to our show (we were walking). So the experience wasn't a good one, BUT I would be willing to try it again, as I did have a very nice lunch there a few years ago."}
{"text":"We decided to bring some friends that were visiting from NYC over the weekend and I have to say that we were very impressed, not only with the food but with the ambiance and service. Cibo is classy and had a jazz band playing that night which created such a soothing mood. They have a great wine selection and can't go wrong with anything on their menu but the Tagliere and Di Notte are great choices."}
{"text":"He said... I'll take u to wherever u want to go.. You pick... I said Cibo!!!!!!


I had very high expectations for this place because everyone is always talking about it and telling me how amazing it is. I finially got a chance to try it out for the first time this past weekend.  

So we ordered the prosciutto pizza.. I wasn't that impressed as I would hope to be. I felt like there should've been more on there. Maybe some basil, veggies, mushrooms? Something? It was just a pizza topped with some prosciutto.  I also got my favorite type of red wine. Pinot noir. Delicious. I definitely love their wine here. 

It really is a perfect spot for a date. Super romantic. Disappointed about the pizza we got but I'll definitely come back to try the others. =)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go in DT. Super cute and cozy. The restaurant is a house located right next to Vig Filmore. Perfect for a date out. Also my office has their annual holiday party which is located in the guest house. I always start out w the calamari al Limone that comes w red pepper aioli and lemon. Absolute perfection. Light and crispy. I also love their caprese salad. As for pizzas: I love trying new ones each time and taking them home. The crust is thin which I love! I highly recommend: the Funghi, Genova, n Tricolore. And make sure you ask for their balsamic glaze and drizzle this on top of your pizzas!! It is heaven!! And I always top it off w a pasta dish. I love the bolognese pasta. But honestly everything here is absolutely delicious and does not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"First time we went there 5 stars. Second time was for my birthday and the inlaw tried ordering cal zone and didn't take my warning that it is just like their pizza, just folded. Anyways I give it 5 stars for me, but I had a four star birthday there because I was the only one who enjoyed it. Diavola pizza is killer!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first visit to Cibo.  I loved the location (as others have said, a converted house in downtown).  I have never had such good service...anywhere.  I drank a sip from my drink, it was refilled.  I was left alone to chat with my friend and no one hounded me to leave.  I really liked the pizza (I had the mushroom) and the house salad was delicous.  I normally am a ranch kind of girl and drown all my pizza and salad in it, but I did not miss it at all.  I scarfed up the bread, salad, and pizza without a second thought.  It lived up to the expectations set by all my friends that have eaten here before and raved.  So yummy!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza in the valley!  This was my favorite place to go for pizza when living in Phoenix. Very charming setting. We especially loved to bring our dog here and sit outside. Fantastic service. Romantic but relaxed vibe. They also have delicious pastas, salads, and appetizers if you are in the mood for something other than pizza.  Get the nutella shake for dessert!"}
{"text":"Bungalow turned cozy, cool neighborhood restaurant with fantastic outdoor dining and intimate indoor spaces.  Pizza is amazing."}
{"text":"I don't think I've been happier getting take out from a restaurant like this. We had the salt roasted beats and lamb meatballs to start following with an arugula salad. Tried both the pineapple and the olive pizza and I really couldn't choose a favourite. When picking up the order, the atmosphere was beautiful. It looked like they had an upstairs  and a patio? Would love to come back and actually sit down!"}
{"text":"Cibo is my go-to restaurant for anything from a quick tasty salad for lunch to a romantic dinner under the stars. The food and service are consistently excellent and their pricing is reasonable. It also doesn't hurt that it is located in  super cute old house downtown with an awesome shaded tree-filled yard perfect for outdoor dining during the milder months."}
{"text":"One of my favs. The pizza is great and dessert pizzas are to die for. One of my go to spots for guests in town. Great cozy atmosphere for a date or just to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"This was hands-down the most surprising! 
Living and fooding around in NYC we thought we'd seen it all and tasted it all - especially when dealing with Italian restaurant! 
But Cibo surprised us to the core! The pizzas are awesome, the limoncello & desert blossom iced tea, top notch! But what really takes the prize is the frutti di bosco crepe!!"}
{"text":"Cibo's is easily the best pizza place in the city of Phoenix and probably in my top two overall for the valley of the sun (the other is in downtown glendale.) Great food, great wine and an amazing atmosphere, what else could you ask for? Come at the right time of the evening when the white patio x-mas lights are on and you'll swear your an extra in some cheesy romance movie and you just can't see the cameras. Winters are even better when the fire pit is roaring. 

See the other reviews for how amazing the pizza is, i can't say anything more then what's been already said. Haven't tried Cibo's yet? what are you waiting for, get down there. You won't regret it"}
{"text":"I have nothing to say about the food because we did not get a chance to order any. Do not come here for service. 

After reading the rave reviews on yelp, my family and I decided to drive out to it from our hotel in Scottsdale. 

We obviously came for the pizzas, but were told that we would be unable to order anything from the \"dinner menu\" although both yelp and their menu stated that the lunch menu ended at 2pm, which is when we got there. Our waitress told us that those were both incorrect & if we had checked their actual website, we would see that it is actually 3pm (as if we weren't thorough in our research and must triple check). We explained to our waitress Erika that we were from LA California & if they would be able to make an exception. She said no, but upon further requests and asking to see a manager she left and did not return long enough for us to realize that service is clearly not a priority at this eatery.  

My sister cleared the bill for the drinks and we left without a single apology or accommodation from the restaurant. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Just landed in Phoenix and was so ready for a good meal. This turned out to be a never fail spot that had atmosphere, a somewhat brusque, authentic waiter, and great pizza!  We were seated in the small room to the left as you come in and there was a big noisy party next to us which made it difficult to have a conversation without shouting (a turnoff), but made for a lively, happening atmosphere. The grape tomatoes on the house salad were so sweet and fresh tasting that even my tomato-hating son urged me to try them. The 3 Bruschetta had even more tomatoes, as well as a bean mixture that was tasty, and prosciutto for the third. The pizza crust was crispy, just like I prefer it, and the sauce with just enough spice to give it a little bite.  There is outdoor seating which seems like a lovely idea on a cooler evening."}
{"text":"I'm not understanding why this place has 4.5/5 stars. They cheaped out on my glass of moscato, the pizza was soggy, the server was neglectful, and the salad wasn't very good."}
{"text":"I ordered the Genova pizza.  Straight up, it tasted like grass.  The onions and potatoes were still raw and I couldn't taste the basil pesto.  It tasted like grass.  The entire meal I was wishing I just ordered a margherita pizza.  My husband had a safe sausage pizza.  I ended up eating part of his pizza because I couldn't stand mine.  

Still I can understand the charm of this place.  It's tucked away downtown and has a homey feel to it.  

I don't know if I wanna give them another chance.  Maybe, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Cibo is excellent. The pizza quality and taste is amazing and they have great specials. I especially enjoy the ambiance of coming here and eating. Such a great aesthetic, really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"In my mind, there is NO better pizza place in the Valley.
From the unique atmosphere, to the awesome servers, to the food that makes you moan in a \"sweet-mother-of-pearl-this-is-insane\" way, Cibo's is a MUST.
And this rarely happens to me, but I CRAVE Cibo's on a weekly basis. The pizza was to DIE for, but the prosciutto-mozzarella sandwich was by far the BEST thing I've eaten in years. 

I love you, Cibo!"}
{"text":"We were brought to Cibo by some Phoenix locals who claimed this was some of the best pizza in the area. They did not lie. My partner and I shared an Ostia salad and a half marinera, half tartufata pizza. The pizza was so good and the salad went well with it. The dough is just so good here - it was crisp and chewy at the same time. We were in pizza heaven!  I would be here every week if I stayed closer."}
{"text":"One of my favorite DT PHX joints... EVER. I've been here several times and have always had an amazing experience. Cute place, friendly staff, quick service, excellent food... I mean, I couldn't possibly ask for anything more. 

The first thing you need to do is get the Burrata as an app... holy COW it's creamy, yummy amazingness on a plate. Funghi pizza is one of my faves. The Capricciosa pizza is also delicious. Okay before I remake the entire pizza menu... they're all amazing, it just depends on what you're in the mood for. When we visit here for birthdays or other special occasions that are deserving of dessert, we always get one of the crepes that have Nutella and other fun stuff in them so make sure you get one!

They have pasta night on Tuesdays and all of them I've had in the past have been great. Each Tuesday they feature two different pasta dishes, and it varies week to week. They have a great selection of wine and are great at suggesting a certain type you'll enjoy. 

They also serve brunch and lunch. I haven't been to either but plan to head there for brunch soon! :)"}
{"text":"Honestly, this is the best pizza that I've had in Arizona.  I'm a sucker for wood-fired goodness and fresh mozzarella--Cibo does both to perfection.  Additionally, I've come to appreciate the character and charm possessed by this little gem in a sea of chains and strip malls.    The wine list is not overly extensive, just efficient and thorough like it should be.  The salad selection is full of variety and offers a bright way to begin their dining experience.  Be warned:  Cibo is pretty tiny, causing a wait on weekends."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food l, service and atmosphere is all perfect!!! It is in an old historical home so the inside is awesome but the patio is even better. With light and a fireplace you really can beat it."}
{"text":"LOVE it.  Pizza is terrific... people are nice.  Love the patio (unless it's summer).  We go often!"}
{"text":"Ignore the old reviews those are from the previous chef. New chef, new menu, awesome food. 

Having a byob Italian place is great as good Italian food can be slightly pricier but you'll still end up with more food for less than anywhere else if you're drinking. 

The butter lettuce salad is AMAZING. I'm not always a huge fan of truffle oil but with the garlic and pepper on the radishes it compliments it perfectly, one of the best salads I've ever had. 

The porcini mushroom pasta is definitely the best I've ever had. Homemade noodles and a perfect combination of mushrooms and Gorgonzola. Got the small portion and it was enough but easily could have eaten the large one. Really like they do that too because if you want to share dishes it makes it easier. 

French press coffee is a nice way to cap it off. 

Will be back again and again for sure."}
{"text":"Finding Cibo's was a great experience. First time in Phoenix, very hungry  thirsty and needed to find a good place to hang out to plan the day. It was Sunday morning & a lot of places were closed for the day. We were so grateful for their Sunday hours! 

Well, we just loved the place, but I'm partial to restaurants in old houses! The music and decor were delightful and relaxing. Menu options were very interesting and authentic and our brunch omelets were delicious! Our server was very pleasant. Only wished I lived in the neighborhood and could stop by regularly; Cibo's feels like the home of a good friend. And luckily, that friend is Italian, mellow and a great cook...."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Cibo - they have great food and I love the atmosphere of the restaurant. This visit was a bit different between my mom (visiting from SK) and I; there were several foods we needed to avoid as we are going through an allergy testing diet. Everyone at Cibo was incredibly helpful and accommodating. I emailed questions beforehand and they responded with complete understanding and suggestions of what I could have from their menu. At the restaurant, the server wrote down the list of things I couldn't eat and brought back a menu with items checked off that I could eat. And he was so pleasant about it! With the appetizer (delicious hummous) he brought me a print it of all the ingredients in the dish. I really liked this place already, but now it's going to be my favourite go-to with the service and options provided for the dietary restrictions I currently have. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I went with a party of 5 later one evening. The place was busy, but service was really quick. Despite being a larger party, everything went smoothly.
The pizza was great! I love when you can taste a bit of the char on the bottom of the crust. It was also a little chewy on the edges, which is my favorite way to have pizza. I don't eat all of the crust, usually, but that night I did!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch while we were in Phoenix. We looked at restaurants in the area (downtown), and Cibo kept coming up due to the amount of reviews and the high ratings. Overall, I thought it was pretty good, especially relative to Phoenix restaurants. 

FOOD: 4 stars.
The food here was really good - better than I was expecting. The only thing I didn't like was the Bruschetta three ways. One piece comes with the traditional tomatoes, basil, and olive oil (really good), one piece had prosciutto (?) and cheese on it (second best, not great) and the third piece had something with olives on it. I didn't even try it because I absolutely hate olives. It would be a lot better if they stuck to the traditional tomato, basil, olive oil one. The Caprese Salad was also really good and it came as a pretty large portion. we ordered the pizza due to the recommendation by our server. The pizza was really good, especially for having no pizza sauce. It was light and didn't give us a food coma feeling. The only drawback was that their lunch menu didn't offer any pasta, which was a little disappointing. Apparently they make their own pasta in house for dinner only, which I really wanted to try but didn't get to. Everything we ordered was really good and I would order it again! 

SERVICE: 4 stars.
Service was really good and really patient. I appreciated our sever's patience while we had a lot of questions and a lot of requests. Everything came out quickly and was really good!

LOCATION: 4 stars.
Cute restaurant but I was so confused walking up to it. I thought it was someone's house, honestly. It was hard to find the actual front door for the main restaurant, because there is a smaller side of the place adjacent to it. 

This place is really good and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for Italian food in the area."}
{"text":"The food here is so delicious, and the waiters are really friendly and attentive! Also, the aesthetic and vibe in this cafe is really welcoming and comfortable. Will come back again in my future trips to Arizona."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza! Delicious salad. I gave 4 stars bcz it was a take out. Will try to eat in next time."}
{"text":"Got the caprese (can't go wrong)...so good!  The bread was divine.  Great tomato to cheese to basil ratio.  (very important!).  Slightly disappointed they didn't serve pizza over lunch...can't wait to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Yay Cibo!
1. We dream of their handmade pasta/bolognese;
2. We're not vegetarian, but veggie panini rocketh;
3. BEST fries ever, until you try the
4. *Truffle fries* (you can swoon me later;)
5. Of course, the pizza is wonderful

Thank you for getting rid of the rudest valets in the valley, continually parking cash tippers in the few handicapped spots available, making needy elderly/disabled/vets etc scramble due to lack of spaces. Boss man called the picks out on it: BAD ASS!"}
{"text":"I finally made it down here with the family and was pleasantly surprised at how quickly we were seated on a Friday night. Between four of us (2 adults and 2 children), we split a salad and two pizzas. The salad was the pesto dressing house salad which had mixed greens, shaved parmesan cheese, nuts, and lord if I can't remember the rest. It was very good though. It was too bland for my husband but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The pizza was Di Napoli and the Crudo. The white pizza was super greasy and too heavy for me. The crudo was good but be warned that the salami was very spicy. I had a glass of rose which was okay. I tried to get the Cioccolotini but they were out so we split a Limoncello instead. I loved the location and that it was a historic home. That adds such character."}
{"text":"Great italian food.  Fresh, home made pasta.  Great Pizzas.  Real italian flavor, not americanized.  One of the best pizza places I've been to in the country.

Also worth noting that this restaurant is actually an old home that was re-purposed.  The have several rooms inside which each accommodate an individual group.  However, when the weather is nice, the \"front yard\" is the place to enjoy your wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Great experience! Drove up with worries about where to park but luckily they had complementary parking! Saved my husband and I the parallel park argument! Was then greeted by the owners and sat in the front room. Our waitress was adorable and super friendly offering suggestions but not being pushy. The food came fast. Large portions and delicious! I would love to return when the weather gets cooler so we can sit outside!"}
{"text":"Cibo is a local favorite! I have been a fan of Cibo for well over 10 years since a former co-worker invited me to go! I've been there for lunch and dinner and just for dessert! Cibo has excellent pizza, the closest to actual Italian style you'll find in the valley. They have a great wine list and also have gluten-free options now, which is really nice! I've also had great service. Their outside eating area is one of the more romantic and fun spots in the valley and is perfect for dining during the Phoenix \"winter\"."}
{"text":"After coming back from a couple dry days of hiking in the havasu indian reservation, their happy hour came to rescue! 

We loved the cute decor and neighbourhood this place is in, the service was good. 

Our friend took us here for early dinner, which happened to coincide with their happy hour offering, a buck for an arancini, polenta fries, gnocchi....all my faves...but other than the polenta fries, those dishes aren't much flavours....the house wines on the happy hour menu def good, either that, or we were just too dehydrated... :P

pizzas were good here, the thin dough was tasty...but maybe i am used to the Chicago's heavier flavouring on the thin crusts, i found their pizzas on the bland side..the sausages toppings are good though...

All in all, we still had a good fun time here."}
{"text":"Love this place! The outside patio is perfect when the weather is goods. Nice vibe, great food. Whenever I go, my boyfriend and I split a pizza and a salad and it's more than enough food. Service has always been great as well."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely delicious i got the antipasti palatter with a side of meatballs and the pizza was super good it wasnt very busy when i went as i had read that the service was worse on busy days but to be honest it wasnt great. Only 3 other tables outsode and not crowded inside we saw the waiter literally 4 times the entire time. To be seated, water, food and check. Never refilled the water or asked about how we were matter of fact the servers seemed more interested in talking to each other than checking on their tables, didnt stick around for dessert. But still I'd  go back for the food alone.
Maybe take out next time."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a date. It is very romantic and II actually like their patio seating more than the inside. We went on a Saturday and they had live music. It was perfect.

I ordered the Diavola pizza and it was spicy, just as promised. My husband ordered one with sausage and he really enjoyed it. We ordered a bottle of wine and everything was just dandy.

Make sure you make reservations, it get pretty packed, especially this time of year. The only thing that I wish were a little different is their bar. It gets very crowded and it's tough to get through to order something if you're waiting to be seated and it's hard to wait in line because their space is small and people need to wal;k by. So, like I said, make reservations for the evening."}
{"text":"We had an amazing dinner at Cibo tonight.  It's truly a beautiful restaurant with a welcoming atmosphere.  The patio has beautiful glowing lights and is perfect for a romantic dinner.  My mom and I didn't need it to be romantic -- but it was still lovely.  We split the Linguine Cacio e Pepe.  The pasta was clearly VERY fresh, and each of the cheeses expressed themselves with distinct yet subtle flavors.  We also split a crepe with nutella and added bananas and whipped cream.  It was heaven in your mouth -- and they did not skimp on any ingredient.  Abundant banana slices, whipped cream (also fresh), and absolutely slathered with Nutella.  We loved Cibo!"}
{"text":"My daughter, grandson and I visited this quaint little restaurant last evening and were very impressed with the pizza and salad.  I would highly recommend trying Cibo."}
{"text":"The food and quality at cibo are good, but not worth how pricey it can get. Service is friendly and quick, and of the drinks, the limoncello is my favorite. The food, like I said, is good but I think part of what gets this place its charm is the cute outdoor lights and homey placement; it's literally a historic home turned restaurant. Parking can be a hassle during their peak hours, but they offer free valet if you're lucky enough to land a spot. I've been to Cibo many times and I've tried many of their dishes, but for the price you're better off checking out some other downtown italian places that offer amazing quality in their food. There's even a sweet little trattoria in Scottsdale that offers these same prices, except there a heavy accented Italian owner comes to your table to check on you and the authenticity and ingredients are unbeatable."}
{"text":"We went here last night for my friend`s birthday. First time here for me. I have to say, had a great experience! We had a party of 20 and they were very accommodating with a large group. We were outside, and with the heaters, I didn`t mind, actually was a great evening outside! I had the veggie pizza, was delicious! Very generous portions and I ended taking some home. Wine list was mostly Italian wines and good selections. I`m pretty sure I will be back here!"}
{"text":"Matt was the best server! He was so kind, polite, and informative to our party. We had a dog with us who he was also especially sweet to.

Food was solid. However the Capri salad could have used more tomatoes, mozerella, and salt in the pesto."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Definitely a wait at dinner time, even on weekdays though. Waited about half hour after arriving at 7 on a Thursday. But 100% worth the wait."}
{"text":"If there were 6 stars I would give them all. Everything was great including the casual, outdoor seating. Our server was very friendly and took great care of us. From the start we liked him as he knew his menu and was able to recommend, wines, appetizers, and entrees. When the kitchen let him know they couldn't prepare one of the pizzas we ordered he immediately suggested one he thought would be comparable and he was right. Everything was delicious! Will definitely be back the next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We go to Cibo to grab dinner whenever we are heading downtown for a show.  We really love this place.  It's likely that you will have a short wait for a table - and it's a tight space.  But it's worth the wait!  The food is consistently excellent and the service is pretty fast.  I absolutely love their pizza and their appetizers are also delicious.  If you plan on going in a group larger than 4, send someone early to put your name in to make sure you're not waiting too long!"}
{"text":"I'm finding that every time I go to Cibo I end up having to wait at least 10-15 minutes even though we have reservations. The waiting area at the bar is too cramped. 

As cute as the place is it is always so loud that I can barely hear the person sitting next to me let alone the person who is across from me or further down the table. 

For the most part, the food is pretty good but portion sizes are on the smaller side and the service seems to be getting slower with each visit.. It's not my number one pick for a night out with friends or date night anymore."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. I want to go again and again. I had a pizza with prosciutto, mushroom, and red sauce and it was heaven. I don't even really like pizza, but theirs are so fresh that I almost ate the entire thing to myself. My friend had a salad that was also delicious. The service is great as well. I highly recommend going when the weather is nice so you can enjoy the gorgeous outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"Cibo is great.  I've been coming here since 2005 and it's been a favorite for casual and intimate nights out.

The pizza is good, but not my favorite in Phoenix.  I really enjoy their salads and desserts.  The crepe with Nutella inside, fruit on top and icecream is absolutely delicious!  And I usually don't even like crepes.

The cons - no parking lot, so you have to search for street parking or use their valet service; also poor ventilation inside, so your clothes and hair end up smelling like their pizza oven; the noise level inside can get pretty loud."}
{"text":"Cool spot for sure. Great menu with a ton of fun choices. Great server too. One bummer was that the outdoor seating seemed to be a tad too cramped... A couple tables too many for sure. It slowed down the service a bit too. Other than that, super cool spot. Live music was rad as well!"}
{"text":"Pizza was great. Got 2 pizzas with one type on each side(4 types). Sausage, spicy pepperoni, the Preston and potato one and prosciutto one. Prosciutto was the best then sausage. Watch out the spicy pepperoni will be too hot for kids. Crust was amazing. Green salad was good. Big portions can feed 2 adults per pizza."}
{"text":"I've always had great service and a short wait here. The margarita pizza is of my favorites in Phoenix."}
{"text":"very good pizza, great crepes. We had the large sampler appetizer plate, and it was really good too."}
{"text":"Get the burrata!!  Amazing!! We went here, hoping to be impressed and we were! The outside was so romantic and precious with lights hanging from the trees.  Complimentary valet!  I didn't care too much for our pizza, but i think of we had ordered a different kind,  I would say otherwise.  Lovely place."}
{"text":"Seriously, WOW AND YUM. I am one of those \"Poor unfortunate fools\" that has to follow one of those very strict diets to prevent inflammation. It was an Italian place so I was worried that meant pizza and spaghetti. THANK GOODNESS I was wrong! I had the most beautiful antipasto board (See picture). I couldn't eat the tomatoes or zucchini, but the rest was all wonderful.  For the first time in a long time, I'm FULL! Plus, my tastebuds are sooooooooo happy. The meats, cheeses, veggies, nuts, fruits all made for a fantastic meal.
Now let's talk service, VERY attentive without being annoying, no pressure to get me out while I sip wine and write this review. It's November and the patio is cool and charming. I would return here often if it wasn't in another state. Thank you Cibo for making my week brighter! I'll be back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Cibo has the best food and amazing ambiance. Certainly one of the best restaurants in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, I YELPED and found this little gem of a restaurant.  Delicious, fast, great staff.  The ice tea is perfect!  Loved."}
{"text":"Foods pretty good, service was not good. Prices are too high ((
However, the place is convenient for food. In general, the place is average."}
{"text":"Fun! Great food! First time here, and already anxious to go back! Sit on the patio.  So comfy.  And leave room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Cibo!  I found Cibo last summer when I was looking for a relaxed place to meet my grandfather for dinner.  With seasons tickets to the Diamondbacks he can meet me at Cibo for dinner before he catches a night game.

I love Cibo's location in downtown Phoenix.  I love that it's in an old house.  I love the staff--so welcoming.

My grandfather is a little disappointed that they only serve wine and beer so that he can't get a gin and tonic, but I like sitting at the bar and drinking a slow glass of wine.

The food has always been delicious (we're pretty snobby when it comes to any kind of Italian fare...)"}
{"text":"2.5 stars for atmosphere
3.5 stars for service
5 stars for the food!

The decor is nice, but it's a cavernous open space full of hard surfaces. Out for an intimate dinner, or looking to converse comfortably with friends? Not here. The background noise levels are incredible. When there's a rare lull in the racket, you realize they have music playing at a reasonably loud level - but you'll seldom hear it. 

Cibo seems to be made for the see-and-be-seen club crowd out for the evening. It's very popular, and very packed. So much so that they ran out of house wine this evening. 

There's plenty of servers, and they're friendly and competent - but they're busy. 

The food, however,  is well worth checking out. We were delighted with the scodellina (chicken livers, gorgonzola, and golden beets), and the lamb meatballs app was perfect (except for the timing - it arrived with our mains). The focaccia bread was oddly fluffy, but very flavorful.

When the mains arrived, we realized we'd ordered too much food. We had the pappardelle, which was good, but not quite of the five-star level of everything else. And lastly, their pear pizza. 

Always order the pear pizza. It is an event. It is a party in your mouth. It is an appetizer and main and desert all-in-one.

When, not if, I go back, I'll try to make it early to see if the noise is less imposing and whether the house wine actually exists. I'll order a selection of apps and skip the pasta. And I'll have the pear pizza."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late night bite on a Friday, and loved every minute of it. The ambiance is amazing, the staff was so helpful and the food was delish!! 

Mom isn't a big fan of pizza, but ask her now and she'll just rave about Cibo's pizza. That alone says a lot!"}
{"text":"Cibo is located just NW of downtown Phoenix in a beautiful house with old trees all around it.  I highly recommend any of the porch seating under the trees - shade in the summer and heaters in the winter so it should be comfortable whenever you go. 

We went on a Saturday night, it was an hour wait, but we grabbed beers at the bar and sat around the patio while we were updated via Yelp as to our place in line (a new feature for me!)

We started with the fried calamari and the burrata (cheese, tomatoes, prosciutto, and balsamic on toast) apps - very fresh and tasty - and then had two pizzas, a margherita pizza with the biggest basil leaves I'd ever seen, and an apple/Gorgonzola/walnut/arugula pizza that we sweet and bitter and peppery and funky. We were very happy with our meal and can't wait to get back and try the pasta!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm torn on this one. I've mentioned in my other reviews, I understand sometimes, people have bad days. So while the service was not so great, the food was! And I love this place, I'm not gonna lie! So the waitress seemed easily overwhelmed, gave us the wrong bill, the wrong drinks, took a while getting our food-ok, a REALLY long time, and also dropped my friend's credit card, luckily I saw it laying on the ground. But the sandwiches we ordered were amazing! Went for lunch. So no pizza on the menu at this time. You will have to find parking, which can be a little tough. There is a lot behind the \"restaurant\", which is really a little bungalow type house and gives it the character. I had the Salsiccia sandwich which was fesh hot and amazing! The Italian Sausage was probably the best I've ever tasted and they feature fresh baked bread in a wood burning oven. The greens were also crisp and fresh and they feature creative salads which could be a meal in itself. Overall, the place is unique and delicious and perfect inside for a date, a lunch meeting and I can't wait to go back for dinner. Yum!"}
{"text":"LOVE everything about Cibo! Food, Atmosphere and Waiters. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Cute place! Pulling up here, I thought we were in the wrong place because the restaurant looks like a house with decorative lights outside. It certainly had the feel of a cozy place, good for a date or catching up with friends. We sat inside because it was hot outside but their outdoor seating seemed really nice. 

My friend and I were in the mood for some dessert so we ordered a Nutella and banana crepe and a Nutella and strawberry crepe, both with whipped cream. They were tasty and not too heavy. The service was also great as the waitresses were very attentive. I'd definitely like to come back to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"My friend Kym S and myself showed up here just as they opened on a Thursday night. We were greeted and shown to our table. After that, service was kind of lagging. Sure, we needed more time to peruse the wine menu and decide what to order, but when I told the server to give me a couple more minutes to pick my wine of choice, she never again asked me if I wanted a glass. In fact, she hardly came to our table at all. Didn't even ask how dinner was, if I remember correctly. Pity. 

I wanted so badly to like this place, and, in a way, I really did. I love the concept and the history of the bungalow. That gets an A+ from me. And the pizza we ordered was pretty amazing. I can't vouch for the wine. It seems like the menu is created for those who understand Italian or know alot about Italian food. Or, it's designed to be accompanied by an intelligent server who can walk you through the wine offerings and pizza choices. Even the specials sounded complicated. Maybe it's just me, but I don't want to feel less intelligent when I eat somewhere. A simple conversation about the restaurant and food would have been perfect, especially since neither Kym S or myself had ever been here before. 

As we dined, the place filled up quickly. And then I discovered that while this is a great little place to eat, don't expect to hold a conversation with your friend or date - it gets LOUD inside! If the weather permits, I recommend sitting outside. I'll take my own advice on that one. As for cost, I thought it was pretty reasonable. $20 between 2 of us for a caprese salad (which had two types of tomatoes and mozzarella - yum), a white pizza with smoked prosciutto and zucchini (who would have thought this combo would be so divine?) and one glass of red wine."}
{"text":"Shared a gluten free pizza and gluten free crepe with my husband and all I can say is we were very pleased. It's hard to get a gluten free pizza crust made right and they do; but it is their crepes that did me over. So good! I'll be dreaming of their crepes long after my return to home to Seattle."}
{"text":"Caprese salad, second to none. Family and I went on my birthday and ordered the meat and cheese board, Il Tagliere, I think it was called. Amazing assortment of meats and cheesed, fresh berries, olives, fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, walnuts just great all together.
Certainly worth the trip downtown! Don't forget to order on of their outstanding crepes! They even give you a free one on your check to entice your return, as if we needed an incentive!!
Great outdoor seating area too."}
{"text":"Ohhhh Cibo  The atmosphere of this restaurant is definitely 5 stars. The patio is gorgeous. The inside of the restaurant is a house. Being from New York originally, Cibo gives me that historic vibe that I might get in an old little Italian restaurant in NY. 

I guess I should comment on the food as well...
DELICIOUS! I have only gotten pizza here and that is because I can't justify getting something else because the pizza is so good. One pizza is large enough to split between two people with an appetizer or some bread. 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Perfect crust, delicious sauce and super fresh ingredients. Delectable crepes for dessert--you have to save room!!
The atmosphere is difficult to beat; it's essentially a little old house with a huge front patio, complete with several outdoor tables, strings of those medium sized \"yellowish\" lights. Inside is so adorable, with a few different rooms with tables in each one. It is always clean and can be a great place for a date or get together with family or friends. So worth it. I've never bothered to wait to eat at Pizzeria Bianco, so I can't say from personal experience but I suspect they wouldn't be any better than this little gem, CIBO. From friends who've been to both, I'd say they'd agree!"}
{"text":"My daughter brought me to this little gem for the first time last night.  Let me just say, it will not be the last!!  Everything was beyond amazing!!  The ambiance was charming and quaint.  The service was excellent!!  We started with a house salad and the meatball appetizer, so good!!!  We had your basic margarita pizza which was wood fired.  The crust was amazing!!  We ended with a strawberry, banana crepe, yum!!   So excited to find this place and can't wait to return to Phoenix so that I can come back.  Check it out and bon app√©tit!!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty good and a super nice neighborhood-y vibe. Service was great and timely without being overly attentive. There was a musician playing outside while we were there which was a nice touch and made us lounge longer. Overall great place to meet friends, share some good grub and wine!"}
{"text":"Fantastic eatery in a darling house converted into an equally darling restaurant. The kind of place you want to move into. I wished we had sat on the patio though. Maybe next time.

We had a great red sauce pizza and I would recommend this place to anyone. It has great views of the skyscrapers downtown. Parking isn't too much of a problem either. It is definitely a good place to go with friends or on a date. I don't recommend it for groups of 8 or more. I went with just one friend and it was fine."}
{"text":"I love Cibo. Whether it's brunch, dinner, or a random meal, it's always so good here.

After trying a few pizzas, I can't pick a favorite. Each one is made so well, with such delicious and fresh ingredients, that it's hard to go wrong. I guess if you pick a pizza with ingredients you hate, it won't be good, but probably not any fault of Cibo.

Happy hour is really nice. Cheap house wine and Italian beer, plus a sample of food items. The gnocchi is fantastic - really wonderful and great to split with a couple people. In terms of appetizers, it's so hard to beat the caprese. The seasoning on the tomatoes is out of this world. It's my favorite caprese in Phoenix.

Again, if you aren't huge on Nutella, dessert might be a bit challenging. That being said, I love sharing a strawberry and Nutella crepe with my husband at the end of a meal at Cibo. It's so good... so good.  Can't really describe it any other way."}
{"text":"One thing I really love about Cibo is their Pizza Happy Hour, 3-5pm weekdays.
If you are keen on an early dinner, and tight in the budget department, this can make for a excellent/thrifty start to any evening or date.

They have a happy hour menu which features a selection of more stripped-down offerings of some of their standard pizzas, each one for only $5. FIVE. BUCKS. That's the cost of a cardboard disc with melted Ken & Barbie dolls from Little Caesar's, for cryin' out loud! 
It is a KILLER deal considering the deliciousness of their pizza. Their website boasts, \"the best pizza crust in the city,\" and I have to admit, it is quite good. Thin, but not to thin; chewy, but not too chewy; delightfully greasy, but not too greasy.

They also offer drink specials like a $5, 5 oz. Valpolicella. Not bad.

The interior is tastefully decorated, nice and cozy.

The service is very friendly. Even accommodating to the cabalone that wanders in in 15 minutes before 5:00 hoping to still catch happy hour. Just be sure to tip a little extra if you're getting a good deal during happy hour. That delicious pizza would normally cost upwards of $15, so don't let your good fortune be your kind server's loss!"}
{"text":"YUMM!  Fun environment and it was nice to split a pizza and fancy salad with some friends!"}
{"text":"It's not your run of the mill Italian eatery.  Forget the bread with dipping oil/spices or butter...instead you get house made giardiniera.  It's unfortunate other restaurants don't offer it, but their half portions are ideal for the rich sauces and soon-to-be-all-homemade pastas.  Their meatballs are nothing short of amazing. More importantly, don't forget it's BYOB. The wait staff is well versed with the menu and super attentive.  Worth visiting."}
{"text":"amazing food here feels like home great atmosphere great place for celebrations gatherings special occasions really recommend this place line might be long sometimes but is worth the wait especially for there pizzas are amazing drinks are great well worth it !"}
{"text":"This establishment is not only my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. It is my favorite restaurant of all time and if my boyfriend would let us eat there every time we go out...I would. Beyond the delicious (d e l i c I o u s) food, the service is fantastic. If Joe is bartering I highly recommend you enjoy your dinner from the bar - he's the best!!!"}
{"text":"Soooo Cibo's pretty good! Riiiight?

...It's also VERY BUSY -Make Resos.

I have been twice now and both times - very impressed. The ambiance is awesome as its loud (but not too), fun, open, and just inviting without being either pretentious or ovedone. Service has been great both times from seating to table, to everything. The idea is family style sharing of Italian - and who doesn't love sharing or Italian? The menu is great as it has LOTS of choice -starting with the list of small appies (a list of about 15 items) that has everything from a date salad, to ricotta cheese (Flavored), olives, and lots of other nibbles. Then there are more substantial appies such as risotto balls and meatballs (YUM ON BOTH ACCOUNTS). We move then to the freshest pastas I have had in ages which come in pretty decent serving sizes with a variety of yummy sauces (we had gnocchi and tagliatelle with bolognese sauce - both really great and tasty). To go with the sharsies on this they have a variety of meats (fish, pork, beef, etc) that come in two serving sizes. We got the strip loin which was accompanied with a small green salad that surprised with yumminess. The steak was pretty awesome and served four of us with the small order. Also on the menu (which we skipped as I'm trying to avoid \"bread\") was a long list of deadly looking pizzas. I did see a wild boar bacon pizza on our table that I stole using my mind powers... looked and smell amazing. TO NOTE: if you like/love Sketti (Spaghetti) - the serving for two was basically a monster platter of noodles and meatballs that could feed your family.. just FYI before you order appies and salads and than platter - also serves as lunch for a week if you care:)

As you can tell - all of our food was great. We had a table of 16 and everything came out hot, fresh, timely and delicious. The whole time our water and wine was kept filled (bonus points there).

BEST PART - the bill for four people including the above listed foods and wine and beer was 106$. (so we ran to the car fast...).. no for real, it was really affordable for food that was quite enjoyed. CAN'T GO WRONG!

Highly recommend and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Cibo for about 5 years now and had not been to Pizzeria Bianco until yesterday. I have been dying to participate in the Cibo vs Bianco challenge but the long wait at Bianco rarely fit into my schedule. That is, until my friend and I were able to stop in for lunch on a weekday when there was no wait...

The verdict? CIBO WINS!

Better menu, much bigger selection of pizzas, salads, and antipasti. Better prices (Bianco's pizzas are either $13 or $16, Cibo has many more choices ranging from $10.50 to $16.50 but most of their option avg. $14). Cibo offers a fantastic variety of pizza toppings.

The food at Cibo has never let me down. I have tried a number of things on the menu and it makes ordering very difficult these days because EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS!! But, if I had to create an All-Star Meal it would be as follows:

Pesto Salad (or Pear Salad; dammit, this is already tough)
Antipasto Speciale (meat, cheese, olives, roasted peppers...and I remember these balsamic onions that I can't get enough of)
Salsiccia (the BEST sausage pizza)
Nutella and banana crepe (enough said)

This meal would feed 3 people, EASY!! My husband and I typically order two pizzas and a salad and still have a couple of pieces to take home.

I should also mention that we got married at Cibo almost two years ago. The food and service was impeccable that day (as always). Prepare to be impressed."}
{"text":"Great food, terrible service! We made a reservation for a graduation dinner and there were 10 of us. Our server had two other large parties and could not get out of her own way. As a previous server, I know this can be overwhelming, but we had to get up and ask to order our food and drinks and to have the table cleared all night."}
{"text":"Being the pizza connoisseurs that we are, we decided to try Cibo a few weeks ago after reading some pretty stellar reviews on Yelp. As you can tell by now from the sheer amount of 4 and 5 star reviews, this place has got it going on like Donkey Kong (sorry). 

In no particular order, here are some of my favorite things about Cibo: 

1. It's right next door to Tammie Coe! We love us some red velvet cupcakes that Ms. Coe bakes up, so it's almost a little too perfect that two of our most favorite things in Phoenix are right across the street from each other!! 

2. The pizza of course silly! Last time we tried three of their pizza's and they were all phenomenal. You could order cow dung and bird feathers on pizza and they would make it taste moist and delicious, that's how good they are! This pizza reminds me a lot of the pizza they serve at the almighty Pizzeria Bianco....and that's saying something. 

3. Simon Crown! Who is Simon Crown you ask? Why, he's only the greatest keyboard player west of the Mississippi! Well, that might be a slight stretch, but he is a really cool black dude who plays catchy and happy melodies on weekends while you eat in the outdoor patio and wait to be seated. He even sells his CD there for $15, but he only accepts cash so make sure to bring some extra spending money next time you go to Cibo so you can support a unique local artist! 


4. Great for people watching. Cibo was voted one of the best places to go on a first date in Phoenix, so you'll be sure to see lot's of awkwardness between couples of all ages. It could even turn into a fun game while you wait to be seated....like, who can be the first person to spot the couple on their first date? 

Well, even if none of the aforementioned reasons for visiting Cibo strikes your fancy, you've just got to bite the bullet and try this place already! I promise you won't go home disappointed (unless you're a real jerk)."}
{"text":"Some nights.... I.... sitting here.... day dream about your truffle pizza....
I want .... I want it .... IN MY BELLY!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh - the best Gluten free pizza ever I am in heaven!! I didn't think that I would survive this wheat allergy but now I have hope!!! The Pizza was crisp and chewy and amazing - I can't wait to try all of the flavors and they even told me that they would make one that was bruschetta - that was poetry to my wheat deprived mind!! Thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"Just awful. Their staff struggles with basic math when it comes to calculating the bill for parties of 2 or more. They don't serve actual pints. A server spilled a beer on someone's handbag, staining it. Overall, I'd recommend Roosevelt, which is down the street. They're not as pretentious, they serve actual pints, and their staff can calculate a bill."}
{"text":"A unique and interesting restaurant which embrases the charm of an old home and gives it a modern and urban touch.  This restaurant boasts a large variety of unique pizza combinations.  Our group of 14 tested 6 of these and all six were fabulous...leaving even the most non-adventerous food eaters in our group shocked that they enjoyed each one.  I'd highly recommend the the pizza with asian pears... it was fabulous!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here as a surprise last weekend, so I pretended to like it, but I was pretty darn displeased.

We got the tartufata (?) pizza, the one with mushrooms and drizzled truffle oil, because we're suckers for truffle anything. The taste and aftertaste were awful, the texture was kind of slippery and sloppy, and the pizza (though cooked in true stone pizza-oven fashion, so kinda expected) had a lot of black char dust on the bottom, which tasted very bitter. Our waiter didn't seem to care about our needs much; he didn't stop by a single time while we ate and it took forever to receive the check. But he DID keep trying to sell us extra stuff while we were ordering, which was annoying. Are the waiters here paid on commission, or what?

I was considering ordering the fried dough with nutella for dessert, but the service was so bad, and we were sitting outside so there were tons of flies around our food. We left. Would not go back."}
{"text":"So, I have yet to make it to Pizzaria Bianco and now that I have been to Cibo - don't think I ever will!!!

It was fabulous!   It was girls night out and we ended up at Cibo for dinner.    we arrived around 5:45pm on Saturday and were immediately sat outside on the patio.  the weather was perfect - the ambiance was perfect - it was love at first site.

Our waiter, James came over and immediately we could tell he enjoyed his job and his love of the menu.  He had lots of suggestions and  we ended up with the following:

Arancini (fried stuffed rice balls) - to die for!
Burrata
Pear Salad
Cappricciosa pizza
fried dough balls with nutella
Nutella and mascarpone crepe

Wow - to say we left happy is an understatement.   Sorry P Bianco - we will never make and acquaintance - my heart and stomach belong to Cibo!"}
{"text":"Cibo tries really hard to be a great little Italian restaurant, but ultimately fails to do so on almost all counts.  

My boyfriend and I made a 7:30 Saturday reservation.  Upon our arrival, we were seated immediately in the back near the door to the kitchen.  The loud squeaking of the kitchen door as servers went in and out was very distracting.  

We brought a bottle of wine to share and were charged (as others have complained about) an absurd $7 corkage fee.  I can understand charging a large bottle fee if the restaurant serves alcohol, because if one brings their own bottle, then they are taking business away from the restaurant. But Cibo is exclusively BYOB.  Why so much?

We ordered the oft-recommended mussels in wine sauce as an appetizer.  It arrived a little late, but we dug right in.  The mussels were cooked perfectly and were served with a large slice of garlic ciabatta.  The garlic was incredibly overpowering.  I tasted it for the rest of the night, which is not a good thing. 

I ordered the Linguine Vongole (linguine served with clams in a garlic sauce), while my date chose the Atlantic Cod (served with potatoes and asparagus).  My linguine was perfectly al dente and the clams gave a flavorful addition to the dish.  Boyfriend's cod was extremely bland, however.  It is important to note that entrees do not come with any sides except for bread and oil.  For the prices that Cibo charges, I think it would be more appropriate for them to include a small side salad or soup. 

To finish, we shared tiramisu and espresso for dessert.  The tiramisu was some of the worst I'd ever had. The ladyfinger layers were dry and the filling tasted like thick vanilla pudding.  It was covered in superfluous amounts of cocoa powder, which made me cough a bit.  There was no amaretto or rum flavoring at all.  

Our waiter forgot about our coffees, so he comped both of them.  

Overall, a rather disappointing dining experience, which is sad because there is a lot of potential in the food Cibo serves. Moreover, the servers are attentive and knowledgeable.  With a few changes to the menu (and 86ing the corkage fee), this place could be great.  Until then, I will steer clear."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here for the second time. We ordered the mushroom white pizza with truffle oil. So extremely good. Not only did we enjoy a fabulous gluten free pizza, but they have gluten free crepes too. I was beyond stuffed when I left, but it was so worth it. Sitting on the patio is a must. You completely forget you are just blocks from downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Honestly ... This place has just continually gone down hill. They don't care about the food they put out, greasy and bland. 
I think if your going to feature a happy hour then it's necessary to treat your guests the same as if they were ordering off the regular menu and not as if we are cheap and undeserving of good service."}
{"text":"The patio is amazing! And the live music was great. But the food is sub-par. The reviews of the food made me really excited to try this place but honestly it was meh at best. And the service could definitely improve. But hey I get it, when the place is good and already has a good reputation the restaurant owners and staff feel that they don't have to put in as much effort."}
{"text":"Cibo = pizza perfection.  I've been to many of the \"top\" pizza places in the valley, and I've come to a conclusion: you won't find a place better than this in Phoenix. I frequent here quite often.  I'm truly in love.

Dessert crepes are also amazing. Just try one. Any one.

The service is great. The waitstaff is extremely attentive, including the hostess/host. The food comes out quickly. Very quickly. These are things to appreciate, but I'm reviewing this place because the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"I ate here once and the experience was decent. The food was good, a little overpriced but I don't mind paying for good quality meals. Parking was a nightmare and the service was ok. The reason why I'm only rating one star is because of how unprofessional the staff/ hostess is. I tried to place a pick up order four times in the last month and I was put on hold for over 10 minutes each time.. when I decided to hang up. I even tried to call back, and I was put on hold again. Their line is obviously busy, since they leave costumers on hold until they've had enough. 

If they're trying to lose business they are doing it right because me and family won't come back. There are so many authentic Italian pizza places in Phoenix, Pomo just to mention one. Cibo clearly doesn't want our money."}
{"text":"cibo are my big guns. 

if i'm going to cheer someone up or celebrate something epic, this is where i'm taking them.

there is a decent wine list, all of the food is interesting and delicious, the atmosphere is lovely. 

i love bringing people here for the first time. they are usually so excited to find a place so unique and delicious."}
{"text":"Pizza is unreal! Do the caprese as an appetizer (not your typical stacked caprese). Such a cute atmosphere inside and outside on the patio."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a wednesday, I have been here many times for lunch but I have to say the Wednesday spaghetti was a great choice. Excellent value super flavorful and absolutely worth the stop in.  
Very friendly staff and inviting atmosphere, the patio wasn't open which was a bummer but I absolutley advise stopping in with family friends or for lunch."}
{"text":"If it could have been better, I'm not sure how. Everything was perfect! Jess our server was excellent and this our 4th time here was as good as the previous 3."}
{"text":"NThis place is just excellent, soup is great and hand made fresh, pizza is great. My wife enjoy over all else.... great value, great service."}
{"text":"Judging from all the other reviews, Cibo is very hit and miss. 

My experience involves a stagette dinner where we were a party of 12 all dressed as 1950's pinup girls.The bridesmaid in charge of this adventure was very organized and had reserved a \"room\", where staff  go to grab bottles of wine and did not hassle our server for split bills.

Our server was great, but the food took an ice age to arrive. So slow that our pasta dishes arrived a good 20 minutes ahead of the scodellina, which were all unimpressive aside from the eggplant, (don't bother with the bruschetta), but the servings are miniscule and we had ordered to accommodate our party.
They did comp our scodellina in the end and we were fed, but what should of been a 2.5 hour dinner turned into a 4 hour affair.

It's bad that halfway through the meal you think you're gonna have to run to Tubby Dog to avoid starvation.

A beautiful space, the pizza is good. I think I would maybe go back as a party of two and skip the pasta, salads and scodellina, but I have definitely had better."}
{"text":"great place.  however, it did not meet my personal taste buds.  my friends and their co workers love this place and give it five stars.  the patio is super nice on a nice weekend afteroon - when the weather is cool."}
{"text":"I heard high praises on their cheese pizza, so I had to come in and validate that claim.  It just so happen I attended a birthday celebration here, so perfect time!

We started off with some apps, meat-cheese platter deal--pretty good.  Entr√©e--I had the Salsiccia Pizze, tomato sauce, sausage, and mozzarella.  I like to critique heavily on the crust which I thought was a nice, thin, but a little chewy with slight bubbly, char for the authentic, coal-brick oven touch.  The sauce was covered lightly but still had enough tomato flavor while the cheese was nice and soft.  The sausage was cooked nicely with porky, good flavors.  

Situated near downtown, you are limited to parking on the side of the road, so no real parking lot.  The decor is artsy and charming creating a friendly, warm mood when dining inside or out.  Once inside you are greeted by a friendly staff.  There is a bar, but it's a bit small.  Depending on where you are seated, you may find it difficult to move around in terms of the air space.  

So for a little Italian in the desert, it's not too shabby."}
{"text":"Romantic,  warm, great staff our waitress was perfect,  she knew her wines, fantastic food, the pizza was perfect matched wirh a perfectly matched bottle of wine, yea,  live music, awesome ambience . Perfect place for a warm romantic date, candles on the table,  lights to add to the ambience outside. Had a remarkable evening."}
{"text":"Cibo's Great reputation is well deserved!  Picked a gluten free friend at the airport and headed to Cibo based on the reviews and the availability of gluten free crusts. Got there and were struck by the gorgeous patio and cute interior. Had two salads (huge and and delicious) and 3 pizzas (2 gluten free and one regular).  Our friend ranked it as one of the best gluten free she ever had, and my wife said she couldn't decide which crust she preferred.  Can highly recommend the Salsiccia, capricciosa, and the tartufo. Truffle smell was to die for. Also an excellent choice of very good quality wines at reasonable prices. The Scarpetta Barbera was great. 
It was chilly when we went but the beautiful patio was crowded with people and heaters. We will be back for the patio as soon as the weather warms up!  Our server was perfect - knowledgeable, efficient and really fun to banter with. She's been there 6 years and perfect for the job. Couldn't have been a better night!"}
{"text":"Each visit has been consistent. Recently went on a Saturday night, I know.. hold the phone, me out on a Saturday night. It was busy, the wait that the sweet hostess quoted us was 30-45 minutes. We sat at the bar, where the bartender let us taste some wines and before we could even make the decision on which wine, our table was ready. It wasn't even ten minutes, so kudos to Cibo for under promising and over delivering. Food was great as usual. Wish they had pasta on weekends, but I will just have to go back on a week night to get their amazing gnocchi."}
{"text":"First of all, I have to say for all those comparing it to Bianco what a compliment right off the start for this place.  Being compared to a place that was I believe voted the best Pizza in the USA by USA today (I think) should right away tell you something about this place.  I am not going to compare the two as both are fantastic places with excellent food.  If I had a last meal and one of these two were served I would not die unsatisfied!

So after about a year of trying to find the right time to go there my wife, 9 year old daughter and myself along with a few friends, we made it to Cibo last eve for dinner.  We goti there at 5:45 pm on a Saturday night, thankfully had reservations and sat right down.  First impressions, am I back east at a great eatery.  The ambiance being downtown outside was just fantastic, something I have not experienced here in Phoenix since moving here in the mid 90's.  Very old world, loved it!

We started with two appetizers, the meat plate with cheese, some grilled veggies and some fruit and the eve's special the fried rice and cheese balls with marinara sauce.  Both were spot on, delicious and loved by all at the table.

Onto the pizza's, what more can you say than spectacular.  My daughter and her friend had the margarita pizza with no basil, my wife the spicy salami red pizza, they all raved and devoured theirs quickly.  Myself I wanted to try two pizzas and was amazed that at a place with individual pizza's like this you can get 1/2 and 1/2.  What a treat and beyond what I expected at a artisan pizza place like this.  So I LOVE white pizza and went  with one half of the potato and sausage pie and 1/2 of the 4 cheese and spicy salami pie.  WOW is all I can say.  Now the sausage and potato half was very good, but it did not even compare to the 4 cheese and spicy salami.  The cheese on that side had great flavor, salt and spice, I sadly shared one (yes only 1) slice of the pie with the rest of the table and the reaction was the same.  Why didn't I order that?  If you like cheese, salt and spice, this is the pie for you!

All that food and yep we still had to try dessert.  My daughter LOVES nutella and they have about 4 or 5 crepes with nutella in them.  She and her friend went with the nutella, strawberry, banana and chocolate crepe with vanilla ice cream on top.  DELISH.  Glad they were kind of full after 1/2 way thru it as the rest of the adults at the table gladly finished it off.  

The adults went with the Fresco dessert, crepes with fresh fruit and whipped cream on top.  It was also fantastic (but next time I would go Nutella), very light and a perfect ending to a great dinner.

Its quite a drive from my house in S.E. Chandler to this place, thankfully we had an event downtown.  Would I make this trip for dinner with the wife on a weekend eve, without a doubt worth it.  Would I make sure to go there next time I am downtown for anything.  Heck yes!  This is just the kind of place that I love.  Great food, great atmosphere.  One of the most enjoyable dining experiences I have had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the atmosphere and architecture of Cibo.   The concept of share plates and Italian food is fun and delicious, just like Sunday dinner at the Italian in-laws.
They have a ton of great dishes, but one of my favourites is the gnocchi and the arancini."}
{"text":"Based upon the other reviews and word of mouth, we might need to try Cibo again. It was very underwhelming the 1st time. My favorite part was the patio. It's great, particularly when the weather permits. Love the atmosphere of the historic places in downtown Phoenix. 
As far as the pizza goes, I thought Federal, Pomo, and The Parlor all taste better. Our waiter didn't help the experience either. Spilled one of our pizzas completely and was very unapologetic. 
Might have just been an off night for them and/or our waiter, will probably try them again at some point."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Great service. Great ambiance. Guido is amazing. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere.  It's best if you go when the weather is nice so you can enjoy their patio."}
{"text":"I love how they renovated a home into a quaint pizzeria. The pizza is good and this place is the best in the winter time... great creeky wood flooring, great pizza and red wine to warm you up! It is a great place for group dining.  The wine selection  is pretty good.  We need more places like this in the downtown area of phx."}
{"text":"De las mejores pizzas al horno que he probado, ingredientes frescos y con un excelente sabor. 
Prueba la diavola o la prosciutto crudo, yo agregue arugula en ambas y le da un sabor muy diferente."}
{"text":"Nom Nom Nom! A colleague brought me here for Lunch last week! Had the Mele Salad, so refreshing on a 116 degree day. Definitely adding to my repertoire of weekday favorites! or weeknight happy hours!"}
{"text":"Quaint house! Restored to a restaurant so very small and yes prior reviews say it is noisy and it is! But that was ok with us. The food is not great but probably ok for Az standards. I am a picky ex Nyer so I did not think the pizza was all that great. I could not put my finger on it. I just found it to be bland and flavorless.  The crust was doughy in some places and burnt in others.The sauce was thin. However,  I liked the fennell sausage topping. Also the calzones are huge! The crepes are a different dessert choice from your standard dessert menu served at most restaurants. They are not out of this word though. I have had better. Caprese salad, again ok but I have had better.  So in a nutshell try it. We had fun, the service was excellent, everyone was having fun. In our room most of the customers were regulars, so that is a good sign. I just did not think the food was that great. Ok for the price. Dinner was 45 bucks for dinner, apps, dessert, and coffee- not bad!Oh here is a tip- get there at 4:50pm no wait. At 6:30 there were a lot of people waiting to sit down. I would go again, especially for lunch, I heard the sandwiches are good! So until then. Sweet little place if you are not picky about great Italian food."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place (Pizzeria Bianco is great, but this place is better). I live in Gilbert so it is kind of far, and yet I still make a trip out as often as I can. Have brought multiple friends to show them the goodness that Cibo is and we are never let down. Great atmosphere, live music outside. The Diavola is my favorite. Complete it off with dessert (Nutella and Banana) and you'll be in food heaven. Two suggestions: turn the music down on the inside and have a better hostess bar (every time we walk up to be seated they seem confused)"}
{"text":"While a little difficult to find and park, this place is great.  I love the atmosphere and the pizza is good and has unique topping combinations.  The deep-fried cheese balls are a great appetizer as well."}
{"text":"Generally love the ambiance here. Good food and nice casual atmosphere. The pricing is fine. I would recommend this place if your in downtown phx and would like a nice night out."}
{"text":"Am I the only person in Phoenix who thinks Cibo is just ok?
Probably.  

We decided to book a reservation at Cibo to celebrate a birthday since we couldn't get a reservation at Pizzeria Bianco and my parents are not fond of a wait.

The restaurant is cute and welcoming.  The neighborhood it is in is just a little sketchy, with a lot of vagabonds roaming around and a halfway house nearby.

We were not shy in ordering several appetizers and a few pizzas plus dessert for our party of six.  

Here's what we ordered and our impressions:

Appetizers: 
Il Tagliere (an assortment of Italian Meats and Cheeses) - 4*, this is absolutely the best thing on the menu for a group

Bresaola - 3*, the table seemed to devour this one

Caprese Salad - 3*, standard deal, the pesto was a nice touch

Entrees:
La Noce - 3*, the arugula did not seem that fresh, the crust was very plain and flavorless, the sauce was a little sweet

Prosciutto Crudo - 3*, my parents asked them to add some pecorino on top.  They liked this pizza, but it was a little bland to their liking

Siena - 3*, the table seemed to like this pizza the best, the spek was an interesting addition (though I don't eat pork) and DH liked it

Desserts:
Fresca crepe - 5*, this was absolutely delicious and we ordered a second one for the table!

The service was okay, but we were left many times wanting drink refills.

Would I return to Cibo?  Honestly, No.  There are so many options out there for better food.  For \"higher-end\" pizza, this just doesn't impress.

I will stick with Bianco!"}
{"text":"The seating inside is that of a home, crowded with wobbly tables. Outside looks like a good hang I suppose.

There are no fountain drinks which always seems to be the case in pretentious places along with the exclusion of saccharin from the sweetener options cause we know how awesome sugar is for you. Anyone lose a foot to sweet and low lately?

The meatballs are ok but far from having any stand out flavor. The bread is good though.

The calamari was ok but the pepper sauce was bland.

They only serve pasta after 5pm and you will hear people ask over and over as you dine only to hear the same origin story about how they make it fresh and its spun into gold by an artisanal god who does nothing but work on perfecting the pasta. This whole thing is just to push a feeling of demand, plain and simple. The menu is limited without the pasta so if you come before 5pm you are a sucker, if you come after 5pm you will have to wait. Just the right kind of mind tricks that get people thinking this is all they desire. I think its petty, petty as this review I suppose but its a crap ploy and stinks of smugness.


The pizza has the good bread but goes off the rails from there. The red sauce is watered down. Some people like the wine taste in pizza but this is clearly not the kind I like. They also do this authentic bs with the cheese where its is more of jizz clumps here and there and the meat thrown on with lackluster placement to show how not serious they take themselves.

The wait staff were great besides getting sat at the worst table but all these reviews are delusional. You could walk into a red devil any day and have a better pizza than this. This idea that authentic or age old ways of making something automatically means it's better is BS, sometimes new ways are better suited. To think this place has all these positive reviews for such a mediocre dining experience hindered by purposefully limited options speaks more about the people who frequent here just being happy with style over substance, bland over taste."}

{"text":"In an old house on 5th Ave North of Van Buren where you can sit inside or outside where there is live entertainment.

This is the 2nd time I have been there and enjoyed it more the 2nd time than the first.

Ordered pizza both times and this time had the Funghi Pizza with Italian Sausage. Good thickness with the crust and a good amount of mushrooms and Sausage.

The Capricciosa was tasty with the black olives and artichokes with the black olives on the strong side.

The service was excellent with our server (Kul) who made sure we were taken care of.

The parking is along the street with a small amount in the back.

I like that it is far enough from downtown to avoid the crowd yet close enough if you have an event downtown.

Will be back again to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm going to go out on a limb and claim this is better then Pizzeria Bianco.  You don't have to wait for hours and hours and the pizza is better!  Cute place, great pizza, good wine, and I would highly recommend any of the nutella crepes."}
{"text":"I had such a fantastic time at Cibo.  The pizza is super and the ambiance is charming AND it won't break the bank.  Wood-fired gourmet type pizzas.  Get the antipasto plate!  Salads are good.  I will warn you that the wait for a big group may be epic during prime time.  The venue is a tiny cottage in an unlikely part of downtown Phoenix.   Really cute and fun.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Had to write in response to Tom H.  I'm a regular at Cibo, even though I live 25 miles away. It seems to me that this was a table that was just not going to be happy no matter what. Without exception, every time I've gone to Cibo I've been warmly welcomed by both the owners and the wait staff and the level of service they provide is laid back and exceptional. They're not hovering over your table waiting for you to take your last bite so they can whip the plate from under your nose but they are discreet and attentive at all times. There is a family atmosphere in this restaurant and just watching how much the wait staff love their bosses and what a good time they seem to have at work makes me jealous I don't have a boss like that!  I have brought countless friends and family to Cibo for all sorts of occasions and am made to feel like a VIP every time I walk throught the front door. As someone who eats out quite a lot and has been in the service industry, albeit many years ago, I find it amazing that a group of six would argue with a busy waiter about splitting a check six ways, how embarrassing. What is the problem with just putting in cash for your share when you know you're eating as a large group? Or even splitting it evenly between three couples on credit cards. And complaining about a 20% gratuity? Show me any good restaurant that doesn't charge an inclusive gratuity for parties of 6 or more. As for the comments about refills-always have my water and coffee refilled as soon as it gets low-and the portion sizes, well I've yet to bring anybody to Cibo who can finish a whole salad and pizza, the portions are more than generous. Overall I feel I'm a discerning diner who has high standards and I've found a real gem in Cibo, so excuse me if I'm a little overprotective but I feel that Tom H's review was completely unfair to the amazing ambience and fabulous staff at Cibo."}
{"text":"My favorite place for pizza in Phoenix!   

I absolutely love going to Cibo for many reasons.  What is there not to love about this place.  Cibo is a restaurant set inside of an early 20th century bungalow with beautiful hardwood floors and exposed brick. When you walk through the main doors, you are greeted by the hostess stand and a small quaint bar... there are several dining \"areas\" throughout the restaurant, as this was a \"house\" that has been renovated in the historic Filmore area just off the main downtown area of Phoenix.  

The pizza here is fantastic.  People often compare this pizza to another popular pizza restaurant in Phoenix.  I don't think that there is a comparison.  Cibo is so much better.  I have tried several pizzas here, but my favorite, surprisingly, is the Genova.  I always order the pizza well done and the crust comes out nice and crisp.

I love the Pear Salad as well.  The salad is huge and can be share between 2 friends.

You must also try the lemoncello.  It is divine and the best in Phoenix that I've tried other than homemade.  

Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Cibo is my favorite restaurant in town. I have never had a bad experience here. You may need to wait to get a table if you go during peak hours, but it is always worth it. The restaurant itself is extremely unique and the food is the best!"}
{"text":"had a great time at Cibo last night. couldn't have asked for more, great company, great food..the only thing holding it back from 5 stars...was that some jackass was incapable of using a urinal correctly and pissed all over the floor. i know this isn't really the restaurants fault, they cannot have a 24/7 bathroom nanny to make sure its spotless for my liking, but it did distract from me really really liking everything there."}
{"text":"Cibo is phenomenal! You must try the burrata appetizer it is deliciously creamy and  is served with prosciutto and toast points. The best time to visit is when the weather cools down and you can sit outside and enjoy live music (on the weekends only I think)."}
