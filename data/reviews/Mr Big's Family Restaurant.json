{"text":"I don't understand why mr bigs is rated so poorly. It's a shame because this place has some of the best Jamaican jerk chicken, oxtail, stew chicken, ackee and salt fish, porridge, and dumpling I've ever had. My partner 100% agrees. And trust me I've gone to many many places testing out Caribbean food. Mr bigs is always my #1. Their portions are generous and the prices are quite reasonable. I hope yelpers will not be discouraged by the poor rating. I promise you will not be disappointed. This place always hits the spot and tops all other Caribbean establishments, even those downtown. If you're unsure try their daily lunch specials or breakfast special. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If u wanna go off my 4 star rating...the only thing i eat here is the stew chicken.. End all and be all to me"}
{"text":"I've been to Mr Bigg's countless times. I can strongly say their food is consistently good and their prices are spectacular. From the outside it doesn't look nearly as nice as the inside, so do not be fooled. Their all day breakfast is great and their sweet chicken is even better!"}
{"text":"Who has reviewed this place in the past.  Let me start by saying the person taking the orders takes longer taking your order then the person putting your food together.  I ordered a large oxtail with Rice.  To eat in . The rice was left over reheated rice it was in clumps dry not tasty . Oxtail not much flavor plain. They did have hot sauce on the table but the bottle was nasty dusty  so I did not touch it. The only good thing about my lunch was the drink was cold. People make your way to Hwy 10 for good food"}
{"text":"I ordered small curry chicken and a patty for take out all for about $8. Service was quick, not necessarily friendly. My meal had tons of rice, fall of the bone chicken, and slaw. It all came in a small square styrofoam box. The food smelled good, in fact promising, but after a few bites, I realized the smell was much more delicious than how it actually tasted.  Flavours weren't strong enough for me. In fact, it didn't really taste like curry. I imagine myself eating this at home in a large bowl while binge watching Netflix shows. That's not really compliment - I feel like I can cook this stuff at home. The spices weren't strong at all and I felt like I didn't pay for for authentic food. I also noticed there were a lot of small chicken bones. This got annoying. As for the patty, it was a decent patty but they don't make it there.   Huge portions for a good price. You get your quantity, but not necessarily quality. Overall, Mr. Big's is ok but I'm not really big on the food."}
{"text":"Wow! this was a shocker because one my friend recommend this place, so of course I showed up to try their jerk chicken, it was really bad like wow bad! on top of everything the owners are actually Jamaican, how can they make such horrible jerk chicken I have no Idea  The pros, good customer service, good value, and tons of parking (same plaza as the Timmies )"}
{"text":"The Jamaican themed dine-in area was intriguing as a first time customer. The menu size was very customer friendly. The cashier was very friendly and patient as I took time ordering my meal.   I ordered 3 medium Jerk chicken meals. It took about 10 minutes to receive all three meals which immediately made me skeptical about the freshness of the food. Regardless, when I took the meal home I was not impressed. It seemed like a normal home cooked meal I could have thrown together in an hour. The Jerk Chicken flavouring was dull and the rice was certainly not fresh.   The portion size was excellent and is the main reason why I'm giving Mr.Big's 3/5.   Overall, you will get your money's worth in terms of filling up your belly, but the food is not that impressive."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this little family restaurant for a while now, since it's not far from the office. Maybe once a week and I was surprised to see its only rated 3 stars! Not fair at all!  You can tell there's a lot of love to this restaurant since each time I come there's something different, it's kept clean (although some work still to be done at the back) and comfortable enough.  You can tell that the flavour is authentic just by looking at the crowd that comes to eat here. The food is great and the portions are very generous! I started to go from big to medium to small since I found its hard to finish with all these food.  Now, they have started to cook soup of the day and something's different each day in the menu.  I'm not Jamaican and I'm not a big conoceur of their food, but that hasn't prevent me to enjoy every soup I had at Mr Big. Even if it's a \"simple\" chicken soup it's been fulfilling and plain delicious! Just what you need in these winter days.  Don't forget to ask for plantain with your jerk chicken (it's extra) but oh man! It's just something you can't miss ! Forgot to add that the prices are very economical, very good value for your money!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best Jamaican spot within driving distance.   Mackerel and food 4/5 - Mackerel was 'deboned' but still had plenty bones in it, but was tasty nonetheless and the food was done right.   Red pea soup 4/5 - One of the best I have tasted outside of home or yard.   Chicken soup - 2/5 Not a chicken soup guy personally so take this rating with a grain of salt"}
{"text":"This place is my go to for some decent Jamaican cuisine. It is not the best I have ever had but sure hits the spot when you're hangry. Be it breakfast, lunch or dinner, Bigs has your back. Ackees and salt fish for breakfast anyone?  I have been coming here for years and I do admit that service has sometimes been slow. Also had some ups and down with the food but I still come.  Daily lunch specials for 5 bucks until 4 o'clock pm Monday to Friday. I will describe the interior of the restaurant as being small and cozy. There are tables so you also have the option of eating in if you want to. I usually get my food to go.  If you just happen to be there for the lunch specials, try to avoid their peak hours as the line ups here can get pretty long.  I personally love their in-house hot sauce. It packs a nice punch. The owner once hooked me up with a big bottle of their hot sauce, free of charge. Blessed."}
{"text":"Ratings: Food: 6/10 Drink: n/a Service: 8/10 Value: 8/10 Hygiene: 9/10 Aesthetics: 7/10  Came here at lunch because we were craving oxtail, but wanted somewhere near work. I honestly may have had a high expectation based from eating oxtail at other places or eating at roti at Radica's the day before, but I was left wanting more out of that oxtail. It wasn't bad, but could've used a little more flavour (same with the rice and coleslaw).   The service was fast and they seemed courteous enough.   It's a good deal, if you're looking just at the portions. The large was big enough for two lunches. The lunch time deals seem to be the better value though.   The place seems pretty clean, nothing out of the ordinary. The color scheme is definitely based of the Jamaican flag. Although the green inside could be a little darker to match the flag. I suppose it could be a little much for some people.   This place isn't bad if you're looking to fill your stomach, but flavour wise, there are better places"}
{"text":"I only give this a 4 star because I've tried the oxtail and the jerk chicken, which were both really good. The service was good too, as it was quick and courteous. Every time I go in there the place is hopping, always busy and all you see are people satisfied (or more than satisfied) with their meal. You know they're satisfied when they push back from the table and undo their belt. Laaawd Jesus."}
{"text":"Came here during the lunch rush, the place was quite busy with lineups towards the door. I ordered the jerk chicken and a medium goat and the meal was ready in 10 minutes. The cashier was friendly and was quick to take my order as well. The decor inside was very cozy and had enough tables for evryone in the restaurant, the restaurant could use some cleaning as there was a cockaroach on the floor i saw scooting across the floor (doesnt bother me, but i saw another lady eyeing it). I expect the critter problem an inherent problem due to the age of the building itself.  I took the meals for takeout and when i came home both me and my dad said WOW! The portions are HUGE!The flavour overall was decent, could have been more saucy and the coleslaw was good. Overall a decent takeout place."}
{"text":"Delicious, huge portions and very well priced. So flavourful and not skimpy with the meat. Now a regular place of ours for lunch. Definitely recommend the lunch time special."}
{"text":"Food was good size, affordable.  End of the day most options are gone so arrive early.  Quick cheap bite.  Nice hole in the wall :)"}
{"text":"Big portions, small price.  Great food, good attitude.  These are the cornerstones of a great takeout joint.  Their portions are huge!  Just a warning - the Medium size is good for 2 people.  Get the large if you want XL food portions.  Food is hot and has not been sitting under a heat lamp.  The jerk chicken is well seasoned, but just a little mild for my taste.  The fried chicken is great.  Rice and beans that comes with each dinner is spot-on.  Highly recommend.  Would have 5 Stars if it has a large dining area (so far, can sit about 10)."}
{"text":"Love me some mr bigs fried chicken. Been coming here since 2010, my go to Jamaican in Mississauga. Food is always the same, delicious and a fair serving."}
{"text":"I've probably driven by this place over a dozen times but I ALWAYS seem to miss it. I was gazing at the plaza while at a stop light and saw \"Caribbean food\"... ***Tire screech*** I decided to give it a try for lunch. They have $5 daily lunch specials (stew chicken, jerk chicken, curry chicken and fried chicken) & they come with a canned drink.   The restaurant is under new management which I think is a great thing after reading older reviews! I was greeted with a smile and the lady behind the counter was helpful, they had all menu items in stock (if you go to Caribbean restaurants regularly like myself... You know what I'm talking about. When they \"run out\" of something they never replenish the item which is soooooo annoying to me) however that was not the case with this restaurant! Service is speedy gonzales fast! I was literally in and out in under 3 min.... Very impressive. The food??? Very good! Fresh, hot, flavourful and authentic. Try it out when you're in the area!"}
{"text":"After going to many different Jamaican restaurants around Mississauga and Brampton I finally found some place where I can fall in love with jerk chicken again.  The food is authentic very flavorful and the price is great!! I also love spicy food and when I tried their hot sauce I was amazed at how delicious everything tasted I highly recommend this place for you to go to"}
{"text":"A small hole is the wall place, but where it lacks in venue, it makes up in flavour and price BIG TIME! amazing food for an amazing price, especially the lunch special, a whole bunch of food and a drink for $5 flat. I've had the fry chicken, jerk chicken, and ox tail, all of which were delicious. A couple of other \"Caribbean\" places I've tried have an Indian twist to it, but this feels a lot more authentic Caribbean. Definitely recommend everyone to at least give it a try."}
{"text":"I was walking home from work and decided to stop by to buy a couple things in the plaza and thought why not buy a chicken roti?   As soon as you walk in you can hear the dancehall music, it definitely sets the mood. I see the menu which had curry chicken, fried chicken, jerk chicken, oxtail etc. The girl who was working there was very friendly and ordered my chicken roti which came up to $9. I sat down waited about 6-7 mins and got my chicken roti to go. As soon as I got home I ate it and it was a decent portion, I couldn't even eat it all because I got too full. It was tasty, not enough chicken in my opinion it was mostly curried potatoes. It was a little spicy to be honest but not over the top. I give it 3 stars because of the friendly service and because of the decent size of the roti. I've eaten better rotis before but it wasn't so bad."}
{"text":"green, black, yellow walls like being enveloped in the Jamaican flag  some televisions not the prettiest decor but feels authentic  numerous options jerk, fried, stewed, curry chicken and ox tail of course!  there are fish items but the main attraction seems to be meat entrées  they give large portions the food isn't stellar, but, it's budget-friendly"}
{"text":"Jamaican food that's ready fast, cheap, and doesn't skimp on taste. I love the lunch special for $5 with a drink, and extends until 4PM, perfect for late lunchers like me. The interior feels just like some of restaurants in the Caribbean.   I've had the jerk chicken and fry chicken. You get a quarter chicken with the special. The jerk falls off the bone and has a spice that works for the general palette, although I wouldn't mind it a bit spicier. Moist and well seasoned. Could use a bit more on the salty side of seasoning.   The fry chicken is some of the best fried chicken I've had in this neighbourhood. A light flaky batter with that same moist, fall-apart chicken leg. I love the sweet almost citrusy-pepper sauce on top.   The coleslaw and rice and beans were nothing to rave about but definitely provided a good bed for the chicken.   Looking forward to trying their oxtail and ackee and saltfish! So glad that this gem is in the neighbourhood. I see them lasting here. This space in the plaza has seen so many restaurants come and go but this one has traffic and the people that want it."}
{"text":"Love the food !! The fried chicken and Jerk chicken is AMAZING. Their prices are great and the portions are generous! Its close school and extremely convenient to go to during lunch time. I have told all my friends to come to this spot and now they can't stop, this is our lunchtime spot!!"}
{"text":"I had the Jerk Chicken, boyfriend had the Oxtail. Both were amazing. Huge portion for what you pay, we were able to have a full meal later on in the day. Service was really quick and very nice lady at the front. Was nice enough to give extra gravy for free and instead of me running to the car to get some change for a water bottle she gave me one. Great place, great prices! Will be my new go to for Jerk"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for awhile based on the high reviews and finally had the chance this past weekend.  When you walk into the restaurant, you get a real cool Jamaican vibe. I wanted to order the jerk pork but unfortunately they didn't have that on the menu that day so I went for the jerk chicken instead. Service was good and the food was prepared very quickly.  The chicken was a tad dry and their jerk seasoning  was very light.  I wish their jerk seasoning was more prominent.  Their gravy and rice was very good though! Good portion size.  Another thing I should mention is that their hot sauce is insanely, crazy, hellfire, HOT!!! I normally can handle my heat pretty well but this sauce was a zinger for reals! Anyway, I would give this place a 3.5 stars if I could but I can't on Yelp so 3 stars it is.  I will try their jerk pork next time!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service and amazing jerk chicken. They have so many different options and sizes at really great prices too. I found my new takeout spot! Looking forward to trying other dishes."}
{"text":"I've tried 6-7 different jerk chicken in this area. And this is my favorite jerk chicken after all comparisons :D. Plus, the oxtail is very tasty as well"}
