{"text":"I wasn't sure it was even open when I drove by. The exterior is nondescript and if not for the cars in the parking lot I would have thought the place was closed down.   The margharita pizza appetizer was not was I was hoping for. It was salty, dry and more like over done toast than pizza. I ordered the skapetta entree, a mix of Italian sausage pieces and breaded chicken chunks over penne and red sauce. It actually was one of the best Italian dishes I've ever had. That dish alone made the trip."}
{"text":"Eh, with all the other options in the immediate area, you'd thinj they'd do a bit better.   House salad, house dressing, sweet taste, okay.  Had the fish special, but wow, such a fishy flavor...  why is that?  My girl had the ravioli and that tasted pretty well.  They still had the great lakes christmas ale in May when we went, can you believe that?    Sitting here at 730 at night, would expect a lot more people, older crowd."}
{"text":"The food was overpriced, lukewarm by the time we got it, and mediocre, at best. The 'house salad' was disappointing, I can use Zesty Italian on bagged lettuce at home, try a little harder. My chicken parm tasted old, like the chicken has been frozen for too long. The sauce was the only part of the meal that didn't disappoint, but didn't excite. It was pretty bland all around.  Service was slow, server was pretty clueless. I'm assuming this was simply because they were new at the time.  We haven't bothered to go back and see if it improved at all."}
{"text":"Not sure why they have pizza on the menu and don't allow you to eat in , carry out only at nights. So ordered it to go just because I was hungry. Must have been to busy for pizza with the other five people in the restaurant. REALY!!!!"}
{"text":"Our party of three arrived at 6:30pm on a Monday and met a 20 minute wait.  We decided to sit in the bar and order a drink while waiting.  Two issues with the bar - 1) a family with children was taking up four seats (who thinks it's alright to have your kids belly up to a bar??!), and 2) the bartender was also the waiter for pretty much the entire bar area, so we waited 10 minutes to even gain his attention.  A $5 glass of Prosecco made my complaints dim quickly...  Our waitress was prompt to introduce herself and very helpful with menu questions.  We did not order appetizers but the bread and pesto dipping sauce were delicious.  Unlimited salad bowl, served family-style, was full of fresh ingredients but the dressing was a little sweet for me.  I went with the Chicken and Italian Greens Pasta.  Chunks of pan-fried chicken breast plus a heap of sauteed greens over penne, topped with melted mozzarella.  I couldn't tell what the greens were exactly, but they were cooked well and, I thought, pretty tasty (one of my co-workers also got this dish and thought it was salty... but if you know me then you know that I love me some salt).  My other co-worker got the Veal Marsala.  He graciously let me try a bite - the veal was tender but crisply breaded, served with baby bellas in a pretty sweet Marsala sauce. I'm not usually a fan of sweet-ish Marsala sauces, but this was better than average.  Overall I was pleased.  I would return."}
{"text":"Looks deceiving from the outside, it's actually really pretty inside. It has an old, historic feel to it. Big place too, lots of seating. Not many people here during dinner on a Wednesday night. Hostess was nice, waitress was really sweet. $2 glasses of wine, always a good choice.   Bread and dip was amazing, loved it Had calamari for an app, was a little salty and chewy but still not bad My ravs were good, not out of this world or anything, but still decent And my date's chicken marsela was good too. Had cannollis for dessert, not bad either!  Overall it was a good experience! We had one of the discount deals where you pay $25 and get $50 gift certif. I think it was worth it, however, the drive, not so much. A hike for a west sider like myself, but a good experience."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, as I try to support local places, but the food and the service were both just bad. Our waiter acted like we were bothering him just by being there, which was amazing as the place was nearly empty. The tables were set up strangely for our party, and while he said we could move them, he made no effort to help us. I would mention his name, but he never offered it. Three of us ordered Frutti di mare, and all agreed it was awful. The seafood in it, as well as our calamari was rubbery and almost unpalatable. With the near empty dining room at peak time on a Friday night, I see others have already experienced what we had. The restaurant overall felt very stark, cold and unfriendly.  On top of it all, while the red sauce was tasty, the food was very poorly prepared. What a shame."}
