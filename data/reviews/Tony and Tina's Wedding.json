{"text":"Please do not pay full price for this show.  Not good.  I was embarrassed I talked a friend into spending their hard earned money to see this.  We paid slightly over $100 a ticket.  Go elsewhere with your money."}
{"text":"In one word - terrible.  The only saving grace for this show is the wedding disk jockey.  He was very good!  Save your money.  Go see \"Hitsville Review\"   instead, it was great!"}
{"text":"The WORST show ever.  If you value your time and money then DO NOT see this show.  I lost two hours of my life that I will never get back.  Kurt S.'s review described it best.  Seriously, I'm still trying to figure out what happened and at what point were we entertained.  Okay, maybe the actor who played the DJ.  He had a nice voice but I could've gone to some bar with a singer and spent money on drinks.   Otherwise, there was nothing about the show that was funny nor entertaining."}
{"text":"We had free tickets and they were overpriced.  Left after 45 minutes with only salad for food.  No drinks, had to pay $4 for a small diet cola.  Don't waste your money or time."}
{"text":"I have been putting off seeing Tony & Tina's Wedding for years, because I really don't like the interactive play type of thing.  However, my BF and I were looking for something to do over the weekend without spending a lot of money, so got $20 tix thru Fil-A-Seat.  Wow, we had an absolute blast.  It was a whole lot more fun than any other Italian wedding I've been to (and they are usually a blast).  A couple of good singers, decent food (buffet with 3 different pastas and Chicken parm plus veggies and garlic bread, wedding cake for dessert).   One free drink with the ticket, but any others were Vegas strip priced (the only downside).  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking for fun and laughs."}
{"text":"We paid for \"VIP\" tickets on Monday, February 22. . .for the extra $ we paid we were seated at the back of the room (worst seats in the house), not given priority for the buffet service, and not given the promised extra appetizer. .. .in short there is absolutely NO benefit to paying for the so-called VIP.  No table service; when dessert was placed on our table our salad plates (along with the rest of our dinner plates) were still on the table.  We had to go to the bar to get a GLASS OF WATER.  We have been in contact with Bally's numerous times since our visit requesting a refund, and were offered \"comp\" tickets for another show.  The show was horrible the first time, I definitely do not want to sit through it a second time.  Just a terrible experience as far as the show and the food and the lack of follow-up from the producers of this show"}
{"text":"Have been to the Show in SF, and now Vegas.  Skip the Vegas show, and go to SF.  The food- not so good,  the show- not so good.  We brought some friends who were also dissappointed.  If you read this review and go anyway- don't pay extra for the VIP seats- it was a waste of money, and we didnt get any extra special VIP benefits."}
{"text":"Joy W.   Tickets to this show were a gift and I wasn't sure if I wanted to see it.  Well I have to say that I had a great time and felt like I was at a family wedding!!  The actors were awesome at letting us all feel a part of this family.  There family problems were discussed with us as if we knew them personally.  Have to say the manager at this time, Jason, did an amazing job!!"}
{"text":"KEEP IN MIND THAT it's not BUFFET at all. Just a plate with burger, light salad, chicken and pasta. If they have to call it buffet, you prob can refill many times while I don't think you will be interested in eating too much this kind of junk food, especially when they serve the dinner start at about 9pm or even later.

The show is aweful too. the actors and actress play very hard to make you feel it's a real wedding and so some times they will talk to you pretending you are a real guest of the groom or bride. some parts are very dirty and cheesy.

I was with my friends that night and so I can't just walk out after the first 10 mins otherwise will leave immediately...."}
{"text":"We had a a blast at the show last week! We had two out of towners from Argentina and my husband and I went to see the show last Thursday. We had no real expectations coming in but we could not stop laughing. The cast was amazing and we had so much fun dancing, eating, laughing meeting new people! 

So much fun and the food was yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm glad I didn't check out the reviews before I went - I wouldn't have gone!  My expectations were really low, and we got cheap tix.  I can see if you paid more for your tickets and only got chicken parm, pasta and sheet cake you'd be really disappointed.  

Being an Italian American girl from NJ, I think they really got it right.  There was even plastic on all the tables, and the place smelled sort of musty like a VFW basement - spot on!  It really did feel like some of the weddings I've been to, and I even liked the food!  (But I think I just really, really miss that type of East Coast Italian-American food, and I try to eat healthy at home so this was a big treat).  

The show was funny and entertaining, and I got to talk to the wedding party during the cocktail party before the wedding, and even dance with the groom.  I would recommend going if you can get a deal on Goldstar or Tix 4 Tonight."}
{"text":"After reading several reviews both good and bad I decided to give it a shot and really enjoyed Tony and Tina's Wedding.  The actors are great at interacting with the audience.  The Nun in particular was one of my favorites and really good at making conversation with us.  It is an Italian wedding, therefore Italian food, family drinking too much and arguing with each other publicly.  Since food costs so much in Las Vegas I felt like a 2 hour interactive show with dinner included was a pretty good deal.  Not the best Italian food I have ever had, but still pretty good.  I was a little surprised that I still had to pay for a ginger ale and that it was not included in the meal.  We bought discount tickets and did not have the best view of the dance floor where a lot of activity goes on because of the large mirrored column in the way, so if I were to do it again I would gets seats in a better location."}
{"text":"As a wedding professional I saw a combination of all the weddings I've attended! It's an awesome show with an awesome cast! Worth the cost of admission!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment - lousy food - crummy venue - and mediocre show - Save yourself the money and have a nice meal elsewhere just walk down the strip and watch the drunks and street entertainment and you will see pretty much the same quality and content as what you will see in this show.  Too bad, was hoping for so much more.  Several couples in our party everybody but one guy was highly disappointed.  Show did not end soon enough.  Cold chicken parmesan right out of the food service freezer, water logged pasta, bland salad - glass of water no ice."}
{"text":"I enjoyed T&T's Wedding mainly because we happened to get the tickets for free, and I had never been to an interactive play. With such low expectations and a few $6 glasses of wine I sat back and had a pretty relaxed evening. To go ahead and summarize, I think the show should be valued at about $40 in Las Vegas dollars. I can understand people forking over $100 a head feeling ripped off.

There was no real focal point or plot to the evening other than that mechanics of a normal wedding, which were brief. They ran a few stand up routines, which included guest star Frank Marino that made me laugh. The majority of the time was spent with the cast interacting with us \"wedding guests\" among the various tables. It was impossible to hear them since they did all this unmic'ed and with an amplified wedding band playing on top of them, so the little sub-plots were lost on me. That would be my biggest complaint: half the time the show got so low-key we just ignored it and talked amongst ourselves.

The food and venue were fine but boring, though they played that into the production quite nicely. Watching the establishment owner trying to imitate a disco ball was worth a few dollars on its own.

Highlight: I found myself dancing with a bridesmaid so she could get back at her boyfriend or something, which I think I was supposed to be aware of. Whatever was supposed to happen, my real life girlfriend was all over her in about 10 seconds.

Now that's what I call an interactive show."}
{"text":"SO DISAPPOINTING!!  This show is so overpriced!!  It is very inexpensively done. Bad venue, food is bad, and you can't hear most of the side conversations that the actors have with the audience so you don't always knows what's going on. For the same price you could see a cirque de soleil show with amazing talent and professionally done. 

The actors do a good job, but the brides brother is by far the best. He is hysterical!!

Not family friendly as advertised. Not for kids under 16. MC makes lots of inappropriate jokes, nun pregnant and priest drunk, etc."}
{"text":"Don't be confused by the reviews. This is a great show but you need to like interactive plays. I upgraded to VIP-recommended for better salad and perfect view. The actors messed with our table guests and it was all around good humor. Some actors did seem burned out but the other ones made up for their lack of enthusiam. As for the food, its buffet style yes but what are you expecting to be wine'd and dine'd at the ritz! I gave it 4 stars and  I believe an interactive play can be tough. You work with your surroundings and they did a great job. Thanks Tony & Tina's!"}
{"text":"For almost $400 my boyfriend, his parents and I were seated behind a pillar, so we couldn't see the actors. In retrospect this was probably a good thing since the actors simply could not act. My boyfriend's mother was sure that her former high school students could do a better job of acting. One actor in particular sat with us just like he supposed to do and proceeded to make inappropriate comments to us about religion. He then belittled us for not spending money on alcoholic beverages. I'm guessing that the only way to actually enjoy the show is to drink a lot of alcohol during it. We walked out before dinner. Unfortunately the tickets are nonrefundable. Hands down...the worst show I have ever seen in Las Vegas. Please do not waste your money!"}
{"text":"I went to \"Tony and Tina's Wedding\" in Las Vegas, NV on 10/7/2012.  It was inside the \"Bally's Casino\".  It was the first time that I had seen it.  I had a great time.  The price of my VIP ticket was $119.12 but I had to add a $15.00 convenience charge (?) so the real amount was $134.12.  While the price may seem high --- it is both a dinner and a show combined.  I got to sit at the table #3 with some of the Nunzio family including the father of the groom.  I enjoyed every minute of it."}
{"text":"This was the show I caught on special through GoldStar.  The pasta was really good as was the chicken parmesean. There was so much activity going on during the performance that I got distracted from finishing my meal.  This interactive \"play\" was about dysfunctional Italian east coast families and how they \"act out\" in large family weddings. They had a \"Bon Jovi\" type singer who did get the crowd to sing-a-long and out on the dance floor."}
{"text":"Want to do something very unique and memorable for a dinner date? I recommend Tony and Tina's Wedding. It is a dinner show, where you watch Tony and Tina get married and the family feuds that break out during the reception. It's a really cool concept, because you are actually a guest at the wedding. You get to talk with the actors and actresses. It's like attending a funny, dysfunctional wedding that's full of entertaining drama. It does start off a little slow, but it picks up as the show goes on. 

The food was just okay. It's buffet style. They do offer a vegetarian option. Not sure if the menu changes, but they served us pasta and chicken. Even though the food was just okay, the overall experience makes it worth attending at least once!"}
{"text":"I love this silly little show. Yes it's dinner theatre, but it is seriously fun dinner theater. If you enjoy weddings and all the silliness and drama that goes with them then this is the show for you. The great thing is the drama is not coming from your family so laughter is acceptable. A ticket includes food, dancing, lots of fun & laughter."}
{"text":"Pretty good show...it was actually my second time seeing this show, but my first at the Ballys location...It has really improved from the venue change, the food was much better and we were actually surprised that the portions were so big! My husband and I aren't really big on Italian food but theirs was actually pretty good. The show was pretty funny, random and very engaging...we stayed in general admission which I think is a much better deal, because the VIP was empty and the seats didn't seem to be worth it. 

Good show, good food with nice laughs!"}
{"text":"Just came to the show....amazing!!! the service was beyond exceptional! They accommodated my dietary needs and made me a special dish with non dairy items just for me. The show was hilarious and they made you feel like you are at a family event!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm originally an Italian New Yorker.  I felt like I was at a wedding back home except the food wasn't as good and my uncle Larry wasn't there slipping the kids booze.  The food was pretty good but our table ran out of salad before our other friends got there and they never brought any more even though we asked twice.  We laughed and danced and had an overall good time but it wasn't something I would pay full price for or go to again."}
{"text":"Kinda awkward but somewhat funny. Maybe I just wasn't expecting The dinner to be so interactive. Was less like a show..and more like an interactive improv play. If your into it, then it may be better for you."}
{"text":"This was a totally fun experience. But I have to be honest and say that's because we only paid $20 for our tickets (+ free drinks) and we really got into it. If you're looking to just sit and enjoy a show, this is not for you. If you are looking to get your money's worth and are paying full-price for a ticket, this is not for you. But if you have low expectations, can get a cheap ticket, and want to dance and have fun, this is for you.

1) You have to pay attention and follow the movements of the characters. They're always doing and/or saying something. But you have to keep up with where they went and try to hear what they're saying. If your eyes are only up front and center, and you only listen to the dialogue broadcast over the sound system, you WILL miss out. The funniest moments were the ones that I think most people totally failed to notice.

2) You need to get into it and have fun with it. Interact with other folks and the actors. Go out on the dance floor. Party it up!

3) Don't go hungry. The food is not stellar. Like most any real wedding, you can expect typical wedding food. i.e. Mediocre chicken and bleh cake. I did kinda like the veggie pasta, though.

Follow those three things, and you could have a blast at this show. But know what it is going into it. Some couples at our table looked absolutely miserable and truly disappointed."}
{"text":"My sister and I came to Vegas not to long ago. I was very excited about seeing a musical or a Broadway hit but my sister told me we should see Tony and Tina's Wedding. I went along with it but I soon found myself regretting it.

After going inside, we found our table to be in the back away from the main stage. It was hard for us to see anything actually happening. The jokes were dull and dry. 

On top of that, the food offered there was really, really, really bad (that's 3 times!). It was cheap and fake food that I would never touch in my life, let alone actually eat it. 

That was the only show we saw and I hope I never have to see it again."}
{"text":"Show was Not funny, food not good. 
As a show you get a wedding party with a little drama.
As a food, you get some salad, and a plate with chicken breast, bread, veggies.

Stuff person after the show was rude. 
Show is overpriced for the quality of the show and the food. For the same money you will get way more from other shows in Las Vegas, and will have money left for some nice food as well."}
{"text":"I went here once, while my dear friend Damon was in it.  He fell and conked himself on the head backstage and disappeared halfway through the show.  I would like to say that if I weren't worried about him I would have been more engaged in the show and the like, however I don't think I would have been.

It's no doubt fun, but coming from a theatrical background it kind of seems like an improv game gone awry.  But most improv games don't have an all you can eat Italian buffet!  Again, on the flip side, the food really isn't all that good.

It's not a bad show, but I'm definitely glad I didn't shell out the money for it."}
{"text":"Had a great time. So fun, I definitely recommend attending Tony and Tina's wedding once in your life. It's hilarious! It's much cheaper to order tickets at Vegas.com"}
{"text":"Do not waste your TIME and $$$.  Like someone else mentioned, better to waste it in a slot machine.  You can get screwed out of your money a lot more quickly and painlessly.  Saw this show last night with a group of girlfriends for a bachelorette party. We wasted valuable time we could have been napping before going out later.

We got the tix on Groupon for $49, but the audience should really be paid to watch and/or be related to the actors. The food was bad, and you even have to get your own plastic water cups from the bar.  The actors at our table (one of the groomsmen and bridesmaids) were funny and tried their best to entertain us and did a bit at times.  It captured the spirit of a wedding as in: bad food, crappy music and searching one's soul to feign enthusiasm, and bonding with strangers about how bad the show was.  

Most the accents and jokes were bad, and it was uncomfortable to watch.  Maybe it was funny 30 years ago? Maybe time to find a new ethnic stereotype to make fun of? Cause the Italian thing has been played out."}
{"text":"~BEWARE~TONY AND TINA'S WEDDING @ BALLYS-DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  My husband and I were in Las Vegas for a week on Vacation and decided to go to Tony and Tina's wedding. We paid about $80.00 a ticket so $160.00 (down the drain) So we waited in line for 1/2 hour before the show then they seat you and the guy at the door was rude I had thrown my tickets in my purse because the lady had already scanned them and the guy at the door needed them and I couldn't find them and he got mad at me saying he has to see if we're VIP or not.  So then he seated us....... When we sat down they had a Cesar salad so we served our selves it was ok... So now the wedding party comes in while we're eating our salad and I was getting thirsty. The girl is going around taking drink orders... THE MEAL DOESN'T COME WITH LIKE TEA OR WATER OR COFFEE LIKE MARRIAGE CAN BE MURDER SHOW... And the girl taking drink orders was the rudest ever!!!!!!!!  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND EAT ELSEWHERE !!!!"}
{"text":"Let me say that not all seats are the same. We were first seated at a table which had a huge square pole in my line of view (extremely frustrating). Sadly to say I was VIP and no one noticed that on our tickets until I got up and asked to be moved. Water is free and you get that yourself from the bar. If you want a Coke that's $4 (no free refills), beer & liquor was very pricey. This show was okay. If your table receives appetizers you better grab one and put it on your plate because people at our table ate them all and left us none. The large salad bowl was tasty. Overall food was good (average). We had chicken Parmesan, penne pasta with sauce, steamed veggies with garlic bread. Wedding cake tasted like it had been frozen, not good at all. If you don't want to dance and interact this is not the show for you. Some parts of the \"show\" could be considered a little \"raunchy\". I do feel, water should already be on the table & servers should serve all drinks. Overall all it was okay once they moved us so we could see."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  We purchased VIP tickets which really were not much of an upgrade. In fact the only difference we noticed was  an extra dessert.  The showroom was very run down and is shared with other shows, one right before and one directly after so not only are you rushed in and out there is no special ambience or setting.  This show was recommended to us but we all concluded this was not worth the cost."}
{"text":"stay away. it's feb 2013 and it's a waste of my 2hrs. honestly. waste. food was horrible and cheap. not worth the money i spent."}
{"text":"I've seen this show a few different times. I just saw it over at the Bally's last night and had an AMAZING time! I loved the room set up and how we could join in with the cast and be anybody! That was probably one of the best times I've eaten chicken parmesan besides in my own kitchen...yummy! Upgrading to VIP was well worth it!"}
{"text":"I can't believe these people managed to leech a $100 from me to attend this unforgivable clusterf-ck.

The only thing I can imagine possibly rationalizing the bad food, bad entertainment, and bad venue is that... well... I suppose it's possible that stereotypical Italian weddings really are like this... and the reason that I simply don't \"get\" any of it is due to the fact that I'm not even close to being Italian.

WORST... SHOW... EVER.
I can't adequately emphasize how bad this show was.  I mean, this was just bad.  BAD, BAD, BAD.  It absolutely reached new, never-before-seen levels of badness.  Historians will mark this day as the day in humanity's timeline where not just badness but extreme, prehistoric badness was discovered.  

In order illustrate the insane & unbridled badness of this show, let me recant some of my thoughts during the more memorable moments I had during this show:

--- [What the...?  Why is this Sopranos-type-guy forcing us to take a picture with him?   $20?  For a photo I didn't even want to take in the first place?  I thought we were going to a theatre of some sort.  Why are we traversing hallways along the ass end of the hotel?]
--- [This sure is a long walk to BFE.  Wait... We're going outdoors... on to the ROOF of the casino?  They're actually making us walk outside to go to the show venue?  There's puddles all over the place.  They couldn't even build an overhang?]
--- [Oh, now you've gotta be sh-ttin' me.  This is the room?  This... this... STORAGE room in the back of the hotel is where the performance is?  God, this has got to be the worst dinner theatre venue I've ever seen.]
--- [So, actors are supposed to come entertain us while we eat?  Really?  Cripes, the cast is just loud & arbitrary.  There had better be some good food to make up for all of this.]
--- [OMG.  Did I really pay $100 for cheap pasta in aluminum pans served buffet style?  I feel like I'm eating camp food.  God, I'm such an idiot for buying these tickets.]
--- [Oh for f-ck's sake, they're coming toward us... pleasedon'tsithere pleasedon'tsithere pleasedon'tsi... HIIIIII THERE.  So.  You're one of the actors are you.  Well, ain't that a hoot.  Well, don't mind me while I create a log cabin here with my cheap overstarched pasta.]
--- [When...  WHEN is this going to end?  Wait.  Did it end?  That's it?  I dunno.  I guess so.  Alright.  Off to Nobu's.]

SO, UH, THE PERFORMANCE WASN'T TOO GOOD 'EH?
I seriously don't know what kind of person finds this catastrophe funny.  All it is, is semi-organized chaos amongst poorly motivated improvisational actors.  (I'm not going to torch the actors being that I'm sure some of them might be able to showcase their talent had they been given some decent part in a real show.)  There is just absolutely nothing humorous about this show and I'd rather be forced to attend timeshare sales pitches with my eyelids taped open than see this disaster again.

AND I TAKE IT THE FOOD WASN'T GREAT EITHER?
For the record, I've been to strip clubs with buffets better than what they served at Tony & Tina's Wedding.  The difference is, no one touches the food at a strip club buffet.  Here, it's your only frickin' option, so we starved ourselves by abstaining for eating any more of the food and held out for dinner elsewhere after the show.  After all - what's the point in going to Vegas - a city with glorious restaurants everywhere - if you're going to have to fill your gullet with cheap pasta worse than what you'd get out of a hospital commissary?

CONCLUSION:
This show isn't just bad, it's a complete waste of valuable Vegas trip time.  It actually made me angry to have been taken for so much money for such an awful show.  I wouldn't go see it again even if you got a bare-assed naked Jessica Alba to personally bring me a bounty of 10,000 gold coins and whisper unspeakable things in my ear.  Yes.  That bad.

In fact, the only Vegas show that I can think of that was as bad as this was the Hawaiian Luau at the Imperial Palace, and big surprise... guess what rating I gave that worthless wonder?

ONE-STAR!


----------------
HOWTO:  \"BIDE YOUR TIME WHILE WAITING FOR THE SHOW TO END\"
If for some reason you find yourself at this godforsaken atrocity, I should tell you that there was one entertaining moment in the whole night. 

People were drinking a lot of cheap wine during the show.  Combine that with lukewarm pasta that has the tendency to expand in your stomach and you've got yourself the potential for a lot of... [ahem]... \"upset stomachs\".  

As a result, there were quite a few people hurriedly making a break for the exits during the latter part of the show, so as people got up, my wife & I played a little game called, \"Barf or Sh-t\".  The goal is to simply determine what the motivation is for a given couple's rapid exit from the theatre.  Try it & you may find the second half of the show goes by a bit faster."}
{"text":"Show was average, food is ordinary, experience is different.  $80 (discounted from the tix-4-less places) gets the show, \"dinner\", and a real cool hot air balloon ride overlooking the strip 500 feet high near Mandalay Bay.  The best part of the \"show\"?  Kept me away from the Craps table.  Buyer beware."}
{"text":"The performers in this show are entertaining if overly crass, However...
The serving staff is exceptionally rude, if you can actually find them.  The food is lousy, and the performers eat before the audience, so by the time I got to the buffet, there was little left worth eating.  The food was bland with a mysterious texture.  
Also, this show is extremely pg13, even for Vegas.  Do not take small children."}
{"text":"It was like being at a real wedding- the cast did everything they could to make you feel like you were some old family friend or cousin attending their wedding. 

Exceptions- Guests must realize it's a fairly casual night. if you are looking for high-end black tie or formal style show, this is not for you. It's like being at your high school buddies wedding- right down to the family-style carrots and ranch served as appetizers. It was crowded. The food was just ok, and was served buffet style. The drinks were lame and expensive. 

It was a rockin time getting on the dance floor with my sisters though. We felt like we walked straight on to a set from the Wedding Singer movie. It was a nice break from the strip and the casinos. I've recommended it already."}
{"text":"It was fun I'll go back again this is my third time watching this wedding but they truly need to get that gay guy out of the show because in real life Italians will NOT invited gay guy on their wedding they need to work on the menu a little bit more but in general we hade a lot of fun thanks to the chef My sister does not eat any kind of meat so they prepared special dish without a meat cheese or sauce we truly appreciate the management doing that for us"}
{"text":"I love this cheesy las vegas show! You have to be willing to go with the flow and take it for what it is. This show is ultra tacky but sometimes that's just what I need for a night full of laughs. The food is okay but small. Overall I recommend it but only to people who arent shy or have a stick up there butt."}
{"text":"This is the worst show I have ever seen !! It comes with dinner & even a piece of the supposed wedding cake..As the audience , you are a part of the wedding as a guest . I can't believe some people would bring their young children to this musical/ show. Totally inappropriate for kids. Kind of raunchy sexual remarks . We upgraded to VIP to include pictures & seating but they are so disorganized , don't waste your money-- as a matter of fact don't waste your money PERIOD on tickets with dinner--The food is very horrible also !! I enjoyed our vacation overall but going to this show was WORSE than gambling & losing !"}
{"text":"If I could leave negative stars I would!!! The people are rude and bad actors, the place stinks like old Vegas hole. Just couldn't wait to leave and when we did they almost assaulted us and we had to tell them we were both going to the restrooms and finally we were the heck out of there!!!!  DONT EAT THE FOOD IT IS ALL BAD!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The \"show\" is basically an improvised, anything goes, Italian wedding. I've seen good improv shows and I've seen bad improv shows. This doesn't even earn \"bad\" status, it's just a wretched mess. I'm sure many of the actors are talented and funny, but in this context it just doesn't work for me at all. 

Maybe if you've never seen a live performance before, you'll find it enjoyable, but the food is a notch above chef boyardee straight out of the can. You couldn't pay me to come back to this. Spend the money in Vegas and see a real show with real production value.

I would rather go to McDonald's and listen to white noise."}
{"text":"To sum it up, it was like going to some random person's train-wreck of a wedding. They try to make you feel like you're at a friend's wedding; they have actors coming up and talking to you but you pretty much just want them to go away. This one actor asked me to dance; I told him I didn't want to and he made me anyway and then told me I looked like I was in high school, that I had a cute baby face, and that I wouldn't have a hard time finding a job because my major was employable. I didn't pay money for his opinions about me. After that, we ate and the food was okay. The same actor came up to me later and told me to dance more and asked me who I had to impress. Excuse me. Then later, he made me and my sister get up for the boquet toss (I mean, what if you don't want to participate?). We had a fake-drunk actor at my table, how random. He kept mumbling while I was trying to eat my cake.

DONT waste your money."}
{"text":"I've been three times and am going for a fourth tomorrow night.  I LOVE this show, but you have to go into it with the right frame of mind and know what you are getting.  You are part of an Italian American wedding, the food is bad, the characatures are spot on and yes, the music is CHEESY, but that's what makes it fun!  I guess if you are expecting a Broadway type show with wonderful food, you would be disappointed, but know what you're getting and go with it, it's a blast!"}
{"text":"This show was amazing! We had a groupon for it so we only paid $45 each. It's well worth it! The show is basically attending the wedding of Tony and Tina. The show is very interactive with cast members sitting at the table with you. We had the privilege of sitting right up front so we had a great view of all the action. Everywhere we turned there was something happening with the cast. The food was pretty decent too. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Received comp tickets and glad I did. Basically you are attending a family wedding but you have to pay for it. I can't recommend paying regular prices, maybe if you get a deal. But, if you have been to a family wedding than why do this? Food was horrible, sorry to the chefs built good lord, it's basically high school cafeteria Italian food. Actors were great, they are friendly, and outgoing without being pushy. But if you are not into interacting with people or possibly being brought on stage than you might want to skip this one entirely."}
{"text":"I went to see the show last night, and I really enjoyed myself.  I sat with some tourists and we had a great time laughing and singing and dancing with the crowd.

Don't go for the meal.  It's not that much nor is it haute cuisine.  What I liked was the recreation of an Italian wedding.  I've seen the \"groom\" in many local plays that tourists would never see, so it was an extra treat for me.

The singer who was the wedding entertainer was quite good, and there was a mix of music to please all ages.

I would recommend what others have said.  If you go, look for discounted tickets.  As for VIP tickets, they get you to the food line first (not a big deal), but you do sit very close to the wedding action.  As the \"theatre\" is long and narrow, I would have hated being at the end by the stairs."}
{"text":"This show was a good time.  You have to leave your hang ups at the door.

I got into a \"fight\" with the mother of the bride.  She stole my food and cursed at me in Italian.  What she didn't know was that I speak Italian, so I cursed back at her and showed her some of my Italian \"hand language.\"  (Know your audience, right?)  

We had fillaseat tickets.  So, we had to pay for two drinks.  This helped loosen even my uptight husband up and he did the YMCA with a construction hat on.  

Go, laugh, eat mediocre Italian-American food (it's not Italian food!), and enjoy your evening.  Worthy of an evening out.

EDIT: the MOB contacted me on here and accused me of throwing cake at her and ruining her jewelry.  Please note that I threw cake at no one.  Apparently, she steals people's food so often that additional incidents occur.  As a side note, her taking my food, hiding it, and another person bringing it back could arguably be a food code violation.  Perhaps, I could review SNHD's regulations on that matter.  Do the MOB and girlfriend of the bride have food handler cards?"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fun smoke free early event to take in in Vegas, this may be the show for you! This is a take on a typical NY Italian wedding that interacts with the audience and you become the wedding party. (Don't worry, you don't need to bring a gift). You will dance, participate with the wedding party and relatives and just have a good time. There's even an interactive photo  contest to post photos to Facebook for prizes. Dinner tonight consisted of family style served Caesar style salad & bruschetta and then buffet of chicken Parmesan, baked ziti (what's a wedding without that) , bow tie pasta with spicy herbs and veg, another veggie dish, the garlic bread and wedding cake and cannoli for dessert. Not Vegas gourmet- but not bad. People had a great time and that's all that matters. Where else will you see a nun with tattoos."}
{"text":"Just saw this show last night, it reopened at Bucca di Beppo inside Bally's, and it was HILARIOUS! I loved it! My friends loved it and we all had such a great time! 

Plenty of food, wine, dancing and laughter. At one point I had to remind myself that I wasn't actually in a real wedding, but it sure felt as if I were at home with my crazy NY Italian family.

Bravo!"}
{"text":"I say this is a great place to take a wedding party before the wedding ... Maybe after the rehearsal dinner.   It's just like a real wedding ... and I guess the actors and the theatre people give it 3 stars.   

I give it 5 stars because I was pretty entertained and that's the whole point right.   That it's fun.   I did do the discounted rate but it doesn't matter every seat is the same.  Your seated at a round table like your a guest at a wedding. 

You eat buffet style.  There is a money dance.  If you have a fun group you can go dance when the band comes on.   I recommend it as a group activity ..."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews I knew it would be cheesy but that added to the fun. The whole show is interactive with all the guest and just like any wedding...there is drama and lots of laughs. The dancing was fun and even got my husband out of his chair and in my arms...the food not great but good. The wedding is not over booked which makes it possible to be involved in the wedding, whether you are chatting it up with the bride or groom, or doing the chicken dance you will have a good time. Did you a Groupon..you should print the confirmation or you will have to email the box office when you go to pick up your tickets the day before."}
{"text":"Help! I'm stuck in the worst, cheesiest show on the Strip because I didn't check Yelp first before buying tickets for my wife, my dad and his wife. Bad \"show\" (because there is no show or plot or anything - just a caricature of every bad wedding you've ever been to. 

Also, very bad food -- do not think for a moment you're coming here for the meal. I mean you really should eat before you come, because the food is the worst. Dog food is a step up. It's buffet style ala high school lunchroom, with one choice. Enjoy!

Look, I love interactive theater as much as the next person. But it has to be *good* interactive theater, with some kind of actual, coherent plot -- not \"Let's pretend to be at a wedding and there's some kind of feud or something, and oh, it's time to dance to music that was cool 20 years ago.\"

We will be avoiding the \"Tony and Tina's Great Big Divorce Party.\""}
{"text":"Loved it"}
{"text":"I thought it was stupid and not my thing.  You are better off crashing a real wedding, it would be more interesting."}
{"text":"**This show is located inside the Harris Casino.**
This show is getting a bad rap. I absolutely enjoyed myself. I was entertained the entire time. The talk of drunken Italians is a bit disrespectful, I'm Italian and this was hilarious. Maybe a bit more than reality but pretty darn close to a real Italian family. If you don't have a good sense of humor or are a true stick in the mud this show isn't for you. The show is almost 100% audience interactive. I was only in my seat for about 25 minutes of the 2 hour show. Dancing, singing, taking pictures, getting food, the bar. The base rate of the show ticket is pricy. Well your a moron if you pay full price. Do find a deal lol. I did. Google it, 1/2 price ticket booths, in hotel room coupon booklets. So many options. 
Your show ticket includes dinner, which is nice. It doesn't not include drinks. So be aware when ordering drinks from the server. Salad is served 1st at your table. So dig in. Don't be shy. Dinner was A-ok. What was being served: baked ziti, chicken parmesan, bow tie pasta, veggies, & bread. Go ahead get everything you payed for it. I sure did! Check out my picture you can see my plate. The food is comparable to a buffet style meal. Nothing to write home over but definitely not gross. Lol!! When the show concludes, Tony & Tina cut their cake and cake is served to the entire audience. The cake is pretty delicious. Totally grab a slice. 
So what is my point here. This show is interactive, if you are boring and do not want to play along in the show this is not the show for you. Seriously don't be to serious in life. Go with it, it's all pretend anyways. Hate to break it to ya, but Tony and Tina's wedding is just a show not a real wedding you old farts. Get up and dance :)"}
{"text":"The first time I saw this I was not very impressed, however since they have moved to Bally's the show has greatly improved. We very much enjoyed our second trip to the wedding. The actors, the food, everything has very much improved. While I would definitely not recommend this for children, it is a very fun show to go to. However, you do have to be willing to go along with the show, as the whole show involves the audience. Have fun, become part of the family, and join in on the celebration... I noticed some people commenting on the food, When we went the food was delicious. We received a very large antipasto salad (ceasar is also available) and bruschetta as appetizers. During the ceremony we went up to the \"buffet\" and were given Chicken Parmesean, which was huge and delicious. There were also two other types of pasta that were delicious as well, and a garlic roll. At the end of the ceremony we were given cannoli's, and then the wedding cake. All of the food was very good. Even the first time we went the food was delicious. All in all a lot of fun and  good food."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. not sure why it's been running so long. Must be my lack of sense of humour.

In essence it's an interactive dinner show. you are at a \"friend's\" wedding and get to chat with the \"actors\". If you go VIP you get to conga with them too. Food was ok.

I think they could have made a lot more of the show by adding a bit more cabaret style entertainment."}
{"text":"This show is OK if you get a deal on your tickets. (I had buy 1 get 1 free). I was also able to drive to the show in 20 minutes. It was a nice night out. The food was absolutely awful-eat something before you go. We had fun but I wouldn't go again or take guests to see it."}
{"text":"Worse show I had ever went to!!! It was nothing like I expected. The food was not good at all. There was some laughs here and there, but nothing to get me to enjoy the wedding. If your smart, don't even go. IT was too terrible!!!"}
{"text":"I went to this show several years ago with my parents.  We love going to little shows and are pretty easy to please. This show reminded me of one of those \"Melodrama in the Park\" performances I was forced to attend because my sister was acting in it.  Let me mention that my sister was in high school...in Lubbock, TX...the show was free...and most importantly, it catered to children under the age of 10. 

I honestly can not believe it is still running!!!  We ended up leaving even though I think they had more food coming...we just couldn't take it anymore! I was shocked to find out that my dad had paid around $100/person---I would not want to go if it was $5/person.

It is by far the worst show I've been to in Vegas. On the bright side of things, I always appreciate every good show in Vegas that much more."}
{"text":"I went to Tony and Tina's wedding and the show was pretty funny. It was a full house and it took a few minutes to get into the swing of things.  The atmosphere was very casual.. There was alot of dancing and alot of laughs I promise you. The one thing that was a huge disappointment was the food. The bread was stale the pasta was tasteless and boring and the salad tasted like it was dressed in water. If you want a good time and an interactive show with alot of laughs and dinner. This is one to sincerely consider."}
{"text":"Some people seem to genuinely have a blast dancing and stuff. But I was not one of them. To me it was boring. Don't like interacting with the cast. Lots of over, way over the top stereotyping to a culture that likely does not exist. 

But some folks really seemed to enjoy themselves."}
{"text":"So I went to Tony and Tina's Wedding show with low expectations but figured it would be fun and you get free food out of the deal. I got comp tickets so I really had nothing to lose right? Not Really!

The actors are not very good and they try too hard to get the audience involved. I was so confused by this random guy who kept talking to us until I realized he was in the show! Awkward

The food was nothing special and it appears to be a buffet but each person gets a small salad, chicken Parmesan, and a bread stick. No going back for more food if you are still hungry. Oh and they have wedding cake but we snuck out before they cut the cake. 

If you are looking for a cheap show I don't recommend this one!"}
{"text":"The actors were really nice, but wow....this show is so outdated. Did not know what to expect and heard it was funny but it was like we were in the twilight zone. It was really bad. This show has been around for many years, and you could tell as it was stuck back in time. The food was bad too.  Sorry, but this was a waste of money and time...revamp the show!"}
{"text":"Just not good.  Stereotyping for comedic effect.  Every tacky italian joke you can think of.  You know, they're all classless, gum chewing, screamers.  Pair that with really bad wedding food.  Just not good.  High light of the evening was the Bruschetta."}
{"text":"I hate to be honest because the actors seem really genuine and sweet !!! 


The food was good, tasted like food you'd actually eat at a wedding nothing special .. and the wedding cake was great !! 

The show was pretty bad .. There was absolutely no plot and the actors were just running around obnoxiously pretending to be drunk with no purpose 

It was very over priced for what you get .. Wine isn't included with the meal and was $30 for the 3 glasses we had .. You also don't get any water you have to go get it yourself from the bar .. 

If you're already at Ballys do yourself a favor and go next door to see jersey boys."}
{"text":"Ah, interactive dinner theater.  Some say it's where actors go to die.  Well, in Vegas......it holds true.  ( I almost died there, I was in TNT for 2 years...it almost devoured my soul.  But, this review isn't about me or my body of work, so let's move on, shall we?)

Tony and Tina's to it's credit is the oldest piece of interactive theater around, and it's still going strong.  The tickets tend to be a little pricey at $125 a pop, but they do have local deals, just check out the box office.  The food is a bit on the dull side, but you can have as much as you want.  Buffet style all the way.

On the bright side.  It's like going to a big fat Italian wedding and you get to hang out with some really funny actors.  Be ready to dance and then dance some more.  But it's not an opera or really a play for that matter.  Don't expect a master piece of Amadeus proportions, but....do expect the bride to get slapped, the priest to get drunk, and the gay brother to prance....and maybe, if you're lucky, someone will Chicken Dance all over your face."}
{"text":"Initital Thought:

Ooohh, an interactive theater show!  With dinner included!  And tickets are half off at the Tix 4 Tonight booth?!?  Count me in!

Thoughts During the Show:

OMG...this is sooooo cheesy, and I'm not even talking about the pasta.  Is there supposed to be some kind of story line here b/c it just seems like a whole bunch of ppl yelling at each other and trying to be funny (emphasis on the word \"trying\").  Oh, OMG!  Now there's a Rod Stewart wanna be on stage!  Ok, this show isn't cheesy...it's just plain BAD, and I'm getting a headache from all this random not-so-funny/bad bantering.  Let's just go...

Thoughts on the Food:

My elementary school cafeteria pumped out more tasty meals than this crap!  :(((((((

Summary and Afterthought:

Show sucked.  Food sucked.  My friend and I left in the middle, and even though the tickets were half off, we still felt jipped!  Sorry to be a downer, but it's been a year and I still can't believe I wasted 2 hrs of my life on this show!  Tony and Tina's Wedding could have been better if there was more of a story line and more intelligent humor.  Why don't you work on that, guys?  It's a wonder how this show lasted longer than Mamma Mia!  R.I.P."}
{"text":"I have such fond memories of the \"Tony and Tina Wedding\" experience! 

My Mother was one of the funniest, wittiest people I have ever had the privilege of knowing. Not to be \"Debbie Downer\" ....when her health began to really decline, my Aunt insisted we have a last hoorah if you will and take a trip to Vegas. While there, she wanted to also treat us to a show. We chose this one. 

The whole way they pull it off is corny and cool at the very same time. You come as if you are attending a wedding and even take pics with the wedding photographer before the show. Then, the whole show takes place before your eyes as you are all participants at the reception of this crazy NY couple and their family! The couple comes around to each table while you have dinner at the reception buffet which was actually quite tasty. The family member cast comes by too. The show was good but the conversations my Mom had with these actors was FANTASTIC! She truly through them for a loop when she confessed to the bride's BFF that she had a long affair with Tony, the bridegroom.  It was embarrassing, yet good stuff! 

It's an entertaining show alternative if you dont mind having to constantly move your chair around to watch everything that is going on. Check it out...ENJOY! 

RIP to the original Virgo M ::love::"}
{"text":"The show is not nearly is terrible as the reviews say and food not nearly as horrendous as you'd expect based on most reviews. Also, there is plenty of it. No, it's not the Bellagio buffet so just get a plate full, how much more do you need anyway?

If you come in expecting Cirque or Phantom grandeur, you are simply in the wrong place. It's corny, cheesy and you absolutely have to be willing to get into the spirit of it, the point is to be engaged. If that's not your thing- don't go. I also thought the larger the group you come with, the more fun you'll have :0)

As for food- it's salad, pasta, chicken and bread. And cake. I had none of the salad or pasta or cake and scraped all the cheese off the chicken and the remaining filet was tender and pretty flavorful in a typical marinara slathered sort of way. It's not Mesa Grill, but who cares. It was plenty of food for me and the bar kept me busy with the modest selection of beers, just the basics.

I read all the reviews below and was horrified at the prospects of losing an hour or whatever it is out of my life attending this show. I was pleasantly surprised! If you go, don't be a stick in the mud and you might just have a reasonably good time."}
{"text":"This show has been around for a long time.
Its been so long since I have been to a wedding I almost forgot what they were all about lol

Me and one of my friends went to see this. I did not know what to expect never seeing it before or reading about it.
It is a interactive show almost like your attending someones friends wedding where you don't know anyone.
I have always heard Italian weddings were fun and this was exactly that. Of course it was all staged out and even though it was a show you did feel part of it they talk to you like they know you! 
It was a fun time, I read some of the reviews and I do not know why it got anything less than 4 stars it was not a bad time!

The food was just like you were at the reception and when they cut the cake it was realistic!
It is good for any age, nothing bad for your family to see.
The food was ok not from a gourmet chef but it did the job.

I almost forgot you do  get a glass of champagne. The only thing is you have to pay to go to their wedding! If you go to 1/2 price tickets or look for discounts you can get in pretty cheap.

Go in with a open mind enjoy the music, and interact!  If you go with the thought of not having fun you won't! Remember your there for a good time its not a real wedding lol"}
{"text":"This show does not stay in one spot very long. When I saw this show it was being performed upstairs in a different showroom at PH. Now at this present time is being performed in the \"V\" Theater. Anyways no matter where it is I feel it is just so so. The characters seem bored and fall in and out of their script, one minute they are talking to you like you are part of the family attending the wedding. The next minute they asked us if we are locals from vegas or visiting? Come on now, just plain silly. I am ALL about role playing just keep it straight!

The Italian buffet for the meal service is mediocre, I never expect really good food at these types of shows but at least let it be hot! It is sitting out way to long prior to the cattle call to go get your plate.

A nice touch is that there is wedding cake and a glass of champagne served during the show after the meal. That is my only decent memory of this show sadly."}
{"text":"Very hoakie...   I had no idea what we were stepping into, and this is my fault! With my parents in Vegas for a few days and we wanted to go see a \"comedy.\" 

If you have ever been to a bad New Jersey wedding then don't bother... you have already seen the show! The actors were all very nice, and put up with my dad's s**t when they came and sat at our table, so props to that... but the show was pretty pointless, and the \"italian buffet\" was pretty blah. 

Don't bother with VIP seating... there are three tables in \"VIP\" and only one was full. It was also in the back of the room, and kind of hard to see. You do get bruschetta and a salad with VIP?? 

Could be fun with a big group of friends, but not so much with just my parents and I... and the 3 old ladies that were sitting at our table."}
{"text":"We went on our last trip to Vegas. We got the discounted VIP tickets, which allows you to sit up front and that really enhanced the experience. The food was Stouffer's Chicken Parm , garlic bread and salad. We had fun watching the other audience members \"get down\"! One guy threw himself into the limbo until his back gave out! The cast was pretty committed to the story and stayed in character. Still, it was like community theatre. We probably were pretty easy to entertain, but it's Vegas! We weren't expecting  Streep and De Niro!"}
