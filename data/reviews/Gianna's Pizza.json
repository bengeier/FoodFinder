{"text":"Local pizza five minutes off the Strip. Great prices, great food. Garlic knots and homemade ranch ftw."}
{"text":"I'm an Italian from  NJ .been making pizzas  30 plus years Giannis pizza some of the best pizza in town"}
{"text":"We love this Villa. The crust of the pizza is nice and thin with a great flavor. The sauce is good and they put the right amount of toppings on the pizza. The staff is awesome and always helpful when we come in.   Love love love the fingers here. They are good plain, medium or hot or they also have a sweet and sour type sauce that is really good. The ranch is also killer.   Good solid pizza place."}
{"text":"This is a great pizza place. The dough is fresh and homemade. Cheese was delicious! Pepperoni tastes amazing. Slices and pizza are huge and the price is worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious food and good service. Its our go-to lunch restaurant for great salads, fingers and subs. I would recommend 'picking up' the food of you go during lunch hours (12-2ish)"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with a friend who frequents this place.  Had a plain cheese pizza.  Just ok. Pricey for what we got."}
{"text":"This sucks. I am still sitting inside Villa Pizza at a dirty table waiting for my chicken wings and fries. It has now been over 40 minutes that I've been waiting and no food in sight. Plus this place is freezing.  It is 46 degrees outside and not much warmer inside, and I am sitting as far as possible from the front door. This is my first horrible restaurant experience and I'm glad I have my iPhone to draft this review.   Never again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place today n had some great food.I had one of there many lunch specials n was very satisfied with there pizza,definitely  had a N.Y style pie n was great.There staff was friendly and I can't wait to try more of there food.I grabbed a menu n will b ordering from them soon.The food that was coming out was looking great n I'm looking forward to my next experience!"}
{"text":"Im gonna start of by saying your New Years resolution should be to check out Gianna's Pizza!! I've never had pizza taste this good in my life! I love pizza! So I know my pizza! Therefore this pizza is the best pizza I've had in all of Las Vegas NV .. if you don't come check out Gianna's your messing up in life.. I would have givin it a 6th star if could !!!"}
{"text":"My company calls on Gianna's for our company meetings. They always serve the best food. We never have issues with their delivery driver, who is amazing, nor their employees who answer the phone. They are a small mom pop business and they rock. M&H Building Specialties inc. would like top thank you guys for always taking great care of us :)"}
{"text":"Had the stuffed meat lovers delight and it was great, only down side was that it was pretty greasy a bit other than that, it was nothing short of an amazing meal.  Thank you for the dinner experience! :)  P.S. I also love the type of pizza places that I can sit down and eat my meal, one of the biggest reasons why Gianna's is great :)"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery worth $40+, delivery time was ok but as soon as i got my food the rosemary spinach penne has NO SPINACH this happen to me twice already and i am very upset!! Im not ordering from this pizza joint ever again."}
{"text":"Muy buen ambiente las personas te atienden luego y las personas que trabajan ayi son muy amable. Comida favorita para mi famila, les recomendo las halas y pizza favorita mia es la giannas"}
{"text":"I used to come here when I was a kid.  It was called Villa Pizza then.  Good news, they kept the recipe and changed the name.  Only pizza spot in town for me. :-)"}
{"text":"Best place to hang out and have some had tossed pies!! Real good pasta too! The staff are so friendly as well and also talk with you about any thing lol Over all I am really satisfied with this restaurant and 5 stars is what it is :)"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. The pizza is always good. Reminds us of our favorite pizzeria in NYC. Only ever had the pizza and calzones, which are amazingly satisfying. Wish it was in a \"nicer\" neighborhood. Don't be put off by the dark parking lot. Customer service is the Best! Always friendly service. Run, don't walk to this place and support local businesses!"}
{"text":"All I tried here was the meatball sub and there pizza and there both really good the meatball sub was the best I've had in a while there's not that many places to get a good meatball sub some places make the meatballs too big and it falls apart and others ether put too much sauce which makes it soggy or put too little sauce which makes it to dry but at Gianna's Pizza they make it just right"}
{"text":"I just want to say this restaurant is fabulous!! This food is delicious no matter what you get and the customer service can't be beat! The quality ingredients that they use make all the difference in the world in how their food tastes. Their prices are very reasonable... It's a very comfortable place that you should definitely not forget about."}
{"text":"**I'm not eating at a place where they don't practice basic food handling practice.** I paid cash for a lunch special the same person who took my money then started preparing my pizza with out washing his hands. I then asked him why didn't wash his hands first after handling money. He rolled his eyes didn't answer me and left to back. When he finally returned I asked for my money back and I left this place. Feeling bad for the people enjoying there lunch."}
{"text":"Pepperoni & Mushroom Pizza and Chicken Wings now that's the ticket. With a 50% off Groupon that's a little bit of heaven.  Wish they had delivery as I'm at the Palm's or the Gold Coast all the time.  Laurie of Villa Pizza has informed me that they do deliver. (Great news)"}
{"text":"Obviously under new Ownership.. Gio i believe his name was ran the joint..he was from Boston . Was always making or atleast supervising the Pizzas being made.. he no longers is around..A lot has changed even tho i only had the pizza and salad combo B . The slice was runny soggy bad sauce decent cheese..not a new york style pizza i have been getting for years even way bak when Gio worked @ Villa Pizza..dont waste your time..oh n even italian dressing for my salad was a cheaper nothing special version.."}
{"text":"10th time here. Everything is fresh, super cool guys, awesome pizza and wings. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from New York so the bar is really high when it comes to pizza. I was looking Iooking for a pizza joint that sells by the slice. I spotted this little nook while shopping in the area and am glad I went in.  The front staff were pleasant. I came during happy hour so I got some cents off my order which is always nice.   My slice was good, no complaints. It was tasty. Decent sauce and cheese, nice texture/bite on the crust. This was a very good find at an excellent price point.    Overall, cute little place with tasty pizza. I will definitely be back for more :)"}
{"text":"As a displaced east-coaster, I have had a difficult time finding a good slice of pizza in every place I've lived. Gianna's has the BEST pizza I've encountered in Las Vegas. I got one of their sandwiches today, and it too was delicious and fairly priced. I also have to give a shout out to their staff, because they are always super friendly and remember your order if you are a return customer. The boss must be doing something right to have such a happy staff! I highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"It looks closed from the outside, and I never would have noticed it if I hadn't been popping into the bakery next door. But come by during lunch, and they've usually got a handful of diners. Note the daily specials and HH (2-5PM, discounted wings, fingers, and slices).  The by-the-slice pizza is just okay, but their specialty pies sound creative- the Blu Diavolo in particular, hyped as a pizza version of wings. For lunches, I usually grab salads here, the antipasto and Cajun versions are filling and fresh... but steer clear of the Caesar, it's drenched in dressing with four measly pieces of meat. They also offer hot and cold sandwiches, but the Italian comes slathered with mayo, which was not appealing.  Prices are cheap for the portion, staff is friendly and helpful. Call in your order ahead of time if you're in a hurry during their lunch rush. Don't forget to check out the photos of Gianna lining the dining room! ;)"}
{"text":"Ordered take out a few times and has always been good.  Tried the buffalo chicken and the fawesome.  I enjoyed the spicy chili, but others thought it was too spicy.  I never think anything is too spicy."}
{"text":"1st experience: we went for pizza and beer night. Want pizza and beers, this is the place. Great deal on beers when you order food items or pizza. Pizza was amazing and the beers were cold. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love their zuccini sticks and home made ranch dressing, so far all the food we have ordered there is absolutly delish!"}
{"text":"The owners are awesome. Great pizza! Friendly and fast service. Love stopping by for a slice when we are in town."}
{"text":"For 5.50 two slices and a drink this is fine. Sauce is a little sweet.  Pizza is NY thin which is cool.  Very greasy.  I wouldn't go out of my way, but good for lunch if in the area.  Not necessarily in the best part of town either."}
{"text":"My husband and I where driving down Sahara and came across this pizza spot. The pizza was super yummy and the pasta was excellent! The prices are good and the service is the best! The new owner Victor and his wife Samantha are super friendly and welcoming... his brother Guilherme very attentive and he suggested the pizza we had... I highly recommend this place ... go check It out :)"}
{"text":"Everyone talks about the \"original villa\" pizza and real  N.Y pizza. Well this place has the it all. True NY style pizza that new yorkers will tell you reminds them of home.  I had a meatball sandwich on the freshest,  softest Italian bread baked in the oven and ooey gooey melted mozzarella over the top. I just found my new go to lunch spot!!!"}
{"text":"love, love,  love this place!!! the pizza is the real deal, and the owner and his staff make you feel like you're part of the family!!!  you want great pizza,  come to gianna`s (named after the owners cutie patootie daughter)!!!"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago I went here with my sister, mom, brother and his family. We sat in the bag booth and ordered a bunch of food. We got the bucket of wings and I thing they must have given us about 40 wings. It was a lot. We ordered salad and pizza too. I loved the pizza. It had a good amount of toppings and the sauce was tasty. I will definitely be back to this hole in the wall place."}
{"text":"My parents have been coming here off and on for about 20 years and seen a few owners.  We all met for dinner tonight here service was great and food was amazing . The flavor and toppings of the pizzas we ordered were delicious and fresh. You can definitely tell the owners run a business for the customers to keep coming back.  Hands down the best pizza in Vegas I've had and been here 24 yrs."}
{"text":"I tried the Villa Pizza in this location today and it wasn't bad. I got a large 16\" with sausage for $12.96 and it had good flavor, nothing incredible. I do want to mention they didn't do a very good job at cutting it, 1 of the pieces was an oddly shaped triangle but massive, took up the whole plate. So being that there was a huge piece, there also came a small piece with looked like it belonged on a 10\" inch pie. Even though the cutting was bad, the pie was still good so I would go back sometime again."}
{"text":"Gianna's Pizza is a hidden gem. They have such a wide variety of options to choose from and everything I've tried is delicious! The pizza is perfect every time. NEVER soggy or greasy. They have a daily special and also the A, B, and C special which are cheap prices in my opinion for what you're getting. I love the chicken alfredo pasta because the sauce is homemade and cooked to order and it comes with garlic bread and a nice salad on the side. Another thing I can't resist is their homemade ranch dressing. I literally crave it it's so good. Their staff is friendly and give great customer service. Gianna's has a warm family friendly environment and I love it. Strongly recommend, it's a must try! :)"}
{"text":"The chicken fingers were disappointing. Pretty much like frozen chicken nuggets. Villa' s fingers were so much better. Pizza is bomb. Ranch is bomb."}
{"text":"From 4/14/15 I had a craving for pizza after I was done with work, so I dragged my boyfriend with me to Giana's.  This pizza shop is a cute little joint, it reminded me of some of are smaller ones we have back in NYC. We ordered a pie, and it was ready fairly quick. The pizza was pretty delicious, you could tell they use a good quality cheese and dough, plus their tomato sauce was flavorful. Next time I come here, I will have to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"These guyz are the BEST!  Awesome sauce atmosphere, top notch ingredients, incredible flavor...  But the best part are the two brothers that totally own this place!  They were super friendly, extremly informative and went out of their way over and over to ensure we had the best experience all the way up to walking out the door, which was hard to do.  To sum it up...  EAT HERE ALREADY!   ;-)"}
{"text":"Dropped in to have a pizza and beer after a long bike ride.  The pizza was excellent. Had the large Meat Lovers.  As a package deal we got a 16\" pizza and 4 beers for $22.  Can you beat that anywhere else? I don't think so. The pizza was cooked just right and had wonderful flavor.   I like and recommend this little joint to all of my Vegas buddies.  Don't miss this joint!!!  Located about a mile west of the strip on Sahara.  Enjoyed this place and the deals well enough that I will probably be back again next week. See you there and come have a beer with me!"}
{"text":"One year later.... What the .... just happened?? Place not a good as it used to be. Sorry.  One of the best pizza shops in town.. All's I need to say........................................................................................................................................................................................good pizza."}
{"text":"Needed some printer ink from Office Depot and was famished, so I popped into this pizza joint.   Apparently I was there during happy hour #1, which is 2-5pm, and rocks $1.60 slices. Nice! I ended up getting a slice, salad and drink for $6. The salad was legit too. Roasted red peppers, olives, hot peppers, cukes... this wasn't your average pizza place salad (you know, when it's large chunks of unripe, random veggies). I was very, very happy with the slice as well. Def NY style aka very thin, cheesy, greasy and made to fold. It's my fave slice I've had in Vegas thus far (!). Not a greasy slice fan? Still come here, just rock the dab. No one will make fun of you. Well... Anyway, it's a heavy slice and will sag in the middle, so, take a few bites before you fully commit to the fold. Yea, I eat enough 'za to comment on that. Ah, can't forget, there's a TV on the wall if you're dining solo and comfy booths if you're in for an extended drinking session :)  Was pleasantly surprised and I'm looking forward to returning.   Other specials... *5 beers for $10 if you purchase any food (nice) *2 slices and a soda for $5 *Sun-Thurs 4-9pm (happy hour #2) - $9 large pies and other specials."}
{"text":"Once I ordered the timing didn't take no more than 10 minutes to receive two huge slices. I ate the first slice using the utencils given since it was hot but then used my hands for the 2nd slice. The place sits about 50 people and they do serve beer as well. They do offer online ordering and soups for the week. For this week the soups displayed were minestrone & tomatoe basil. If youre craving greasy pizza with a thin crust on a budget on this side of town, check this spot out."}
{"text":"Favorite Villa Pizza in all of Vegas. I drive out of my way and pass another Villa next to my office to dine at this one. It's got the golden ticket.  Why? Because when Carmine (the original owner of all the Villa Pizzas in Vegas) sold most of his Villa pizza shops they were not allowed to continue using his secret recipe which was the main reason Villa was so popular. Kim and Kanye should consider naming their love child Carmine after him because the sauce is THAT amazing. THIS location however was one of the only ones who were special enough to get to keep the recipe! Their sauce is money up in here! All of the other factors of the pie are high quality to make it one solid pizza.  Also get their chicken fingers and ranch. It gets the job done. All white meat, crispy, humongous and just right.  Prices and service are decent, too. They currently have coupons in the Entertainment book and also run specials. The restaurant is small, but I don't expect the Ritz when I'm grabbing a slice. It's clean and smells of garlic and red sauce and that's all I need to give me strength to return to my cube and face my never ending Inbox of work emails.   If you are in the neighborhood or live on the Moon. I don't really care. Drive over here and try this mystic pizza. It's golden and just might make your day a little brighter."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places near work for lunch! The staff is friendly, clean tables, great lunch specials. They have daily specials for around $6-7. I love the flavor of their pizza, but I hate how thing the first few bites of it are so floppy from the thinness and greasiness of it. I wish the crust had just a millimeter more thickness to it. They also have good salads and appetizers like mozzarella sticks and chicken fingers. Next on my list to try are their sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here on a regular for the past 3-4 months. I myself am a World traveler and always prefer Mom & Pops over the Franchise Overglorified Trendy restaurants.  If you just want a good Hot slice, a Whole Pie or some Awesome wings this is the place.  I wanted to keep this Hidden Gem a secret but these Guys n Gals deserve the credit due. Service is always on point and you never feel as if you're just a number buying a slice. This is like \"Cheers\" where everyone knows your name but throw in sum Great pizza and Wings. I recommend the Sweet n Spicy!!!  PS. They do sell brews too!"}
{"text":"I got a Groupon here in May and figured I would use it when traveling to Vegas. Driving here wasn't too bad and finding the place was pretty easy as it is located in a shopping center. Our Groupon was $10 for $25 so we got a medium Villa Special pizza for like $15, chicken wings for $6, fries for $3, and a drink for $3. Total was like $4 with the Groupon.  The place was pretty clean and had a lot of seating area. The World Cup was showing at this location which was kind of cool. They have 3 TVs there to watch the game. I did see signs for beer specials that was 5 for $10.    The Chicken wings were the best. It was crunchy just the way I like it and very flavorful. The fries was good but nothing too special about that. The pizza was pretty good too. I like my pizza with flavors of the sauce that is tangy with a kick. The meat was good I think I must have ate 4 pieces since it was that good.   All in all a good place to go to just eat or watch the game. I would definitely go back again for their wings."}
{"text":"I really thought this would be my go to neighborhood pizza spot. Me and the girlfriend had recently started going there after having decent pizza, and received good service from the woman and normal guy there. That was until I went in today and had the rudest interaction with the you guy behind the counter. Not sure if this is a family member working his first job, but for him to be so careless with his rude interactions with the customers, I would think he is just that clueless or thinks his job is secure no matter how he acts. At first he didn't know the menu and begin to talk rudely to myself and my girlfriend when we started ordering from the menu. I can only imagine how pizza would taste from the guy making it if he can't evenly remember the ingredients in a menu item, in this case that they have a stuffed pizza on the menu. \"You mean you just want me to stuff a bunch of meat in a pizza?\" I tried to recite the menu item to him to received more rude comments. I doubt I will ever go back to this pizza spot. Its unfortunate as it looks like it had a lot of promise of being a regular place for us."}
{"text":"I love this place.. The entire menu is great and the service is amazing.. The entire staff is very friendly and efficient.. I've never waited more than 20-30 minutes for delivery.. Only place I will order pizza in Las Vegas..."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service by the owner. My husband called 3 times and was told 3 to hold and hung up on. When he spoke to the owner she said she doesn't have time for customer service. So I guess the don't have time for loyal paying customers. When you don't care about your customers, then we don't care about you."}
{"text":"I work within walking distance so I come here once or twice per week for lunch. My coworker and I will never quit this place as long as they continue their \"B\" lunch special - a slice of pizza, salad, and large drink for around 6 bucks. Not just any plain old salad - it is so mouthwatering good. Lettuce mix topped with stuffed olives, red peppers, banana peppers, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers and your choice of dressing (I enjoy the Italian for the tangy taste, my coworker enjoys it with ranch). The NY-style pizza slice always arrives fresh to our table with bubbling cheese. This places makes my taste buds VERY happy!"}
{"text":"Pizza was undercooked.  Completely white crust underneath and all around.  Dough was too thin to support the first half of each slice even after cooking more in the oven after delivery.  Crust area was ok after recooking in the oven but I shouldn't have to do that.  It's delivery, not Digiorno..."}
{"text":"This place is great. Just a dinky pizza joint, but its usually not too busy and pretty affordable for what you get. Show up and get 3 slices and a couple beers for $10. Great for football games. I usually show up at 3 or so on college football Saturdays, pick a spot right in front of one of the HDTVs and kick back. Friendly staff, pretty clean, and not loud or obnoxious. I plan on becoming a regular here and recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"High quality pie! The sales representative did not hesitate when I asked for a, \"quad pep\" pizza. (Papa johns will not accommodate this request) Lots of toppings, lots of cheese, and quick delivery."}
{"text":"Update: just came from having lunch here. In short, nothing special. This pizza I can get anywhere. Skimpy on the onions and they weren't even chopped up. Almost choked. Super sad, used to be great. Closest thing to NYC pizza this valley had. Not great anymore. Same mediocre Las Vegas pizza.   Update: place has been sold and is under new management. Not great. Service was friendly enough, but the pizza? Not great. There's something different about it. And not in a good way. Won't be going back for a while.   Only place I will go for pizza in the entire valley!! Pizza is consistently good. Service is beyond amazing and friendly. Brings me back to NY and my childhood!"}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza! Everything we've had has been so good. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from here, delivery was prompt and the guy was nice and cute (just saying...lol) I ordered the antipasto salad which was huge and the pasta with tomatoes, and basil, so good.  I got full just off a 1/2 portion and can take the rest for lunch, I gave my roommate the garlic bread and the salad that came with the meal.  Will definitely be ordering from here again.  FYI, the pasta was really good, but for some it may be bland, so if you like a lot of seasoning (salt) add your own, I have hypertension and can't have too much salt so it was just fine.  Add the grilled chicken breast which was grilled and you taste the fresh garlic...yum-o."}
{"text":"Perfect. Exactly what I wanted. Plenty of real and delicious toppings. And a great value. They even endured my end-of-a-long-week attitude. Now, back to devouring this pizza..."}
{"text":"Pizza place by my house it's not like the Mall Villa Pizza's it 's family owned good pizza!!"}
{"text":"I used to come here when it was still a Villa Pizza. The food is still great, but the service has seemed to have gotten much better. Much friendlier and accommodating staff."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Friendly place to go relax and have some amazing pizza. The mozerella sticks with flavorful marinara sauce was pretty amazing too. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Family owned pizza spots are the best.  And this is no exception. Way better than any pie in the area.   Love this place."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Friendly service. I enjoyed their anti pasta salad. I ordered the ravioli with marinara. It was fairly standard. I'd like to return to see how their pizza holds up. Overall, it was good.   Salad, ravioli, garlic bread and Coke for $19."}
{"text":"I was in the area picking up office furniture next door and spotted the place.  They have a good option for lunch slice of pizza salad and drink for about 6 bucks.  Service was fast as well, I will defiantly be coming back to follow up on the deep dish for a review."}
{"text":"Thank goodness we read the reviews on yelp. After all day at the Adventuredome, 6 of us went in here. We ordered 2 16in pizzas and the mussels for an appetizer. The staff was phenomenal... knowledgeable, friendly, patient with the kids and very helpful. Literally catered to our every need. The mussels came out, you got a big pile of them and they tasted amazing($11)! Our pizzas were fantastic, the crust was good, nice sauce and they were big! You can't really beat that for $10 each. We usually just like to try places and move on but, I'm sure we will be back. Plus they serve beer!"}
{"text":"Amazing White Pizza (Florentine), I used to be a manager at Pizza Restaurant in LA and since a left I never can't find better pizza before I stopped at Gianna's. Good vibe ,  service and for sure amazing pizza. This will be my new place to stop when I stay in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I came here after work one day and had the Chicken Parmesan hot sub and I've never tasted anything so heavenly before. Only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because it took quite some time for the food to arrive but other than that it was an orgasm in your mouth! Definitely recommending this place to my friends and family!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Las Vegas hands down.  Taste just like the villa pizza that used to be over by the old Bishop Gorman.  You wont be disappointed and they always have great specials."}
{"text":"This pizza shop has changed management. No longer a delicious little place. Soggy crust, skimpy cheese, onions and peppers cut in huge slices ready for a stir fry, onion peel included. I am divorcing my relationship since new owners/management defensive and rude. Unfortunately its time to seek out a different pizza provider and Las Vegas has many choices."}
{"text":"Omg!! Today I didn't feel like cooking , so me and my girls stopped by Gianna to see what they had, I ordered a Large cheese pizza btw (which is ten bucks 4-9 mon-thurs, all day Sunday ) awesomeness! !! And small salad.  The pizza was so fresh and cheesy,  it just melted in your mouth! It was perfect size, nice large slices! You definitely  gets your money worth. The salad was no ordinary salad, it was drizzled  with some type of awesome sauce,idk LOL but it was beyond good. This was definitely a taste of Italy right in the center of Vegas! My kids are hooked and so am I!  I will be a regular,  and Tomorrow I will be back, and the owner is sweet! Great customer service!  I could go on and on! I still  got leftovers in the fridge,  I think I'll go have a slice now #loveGiannas"}
{"text":"Service was fine, delivery to our hotel was a little clunky. Pizza (Meat Lovers) was not good.  Sauce lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today and it was ok but not something I would crave again.   The pizza:  Crust: good, nice flavor.   Sauce: it was tasty.   Here is why it gets 3 stars.   The crust was too soft in the middle, it was droppy and there it wasn't even filled with toppings (cheese slice).  they need to leave it in the oven longer or something.   The cheese: for a cheese pizza there was not much cheese on it, I get it's a lunch special but how can you call it a cheese pizza with almost no cheese.   Service: the guy making the pizza has a great attitude but one of the cashiers was horid. She was yelling at another girl to help her and it wasn't even that busy.   Would not return."}
{"text":"It's been a long time that I've had only one slice of pizza and not be interested in a second slice. I'm not even going to use full sentences to describe this disappointment. Awfully thrown together. Poorly cooked mess. Threw it all away. Never coming back. Would not recommend. Meh..."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!!! I placed an early order ( Before they were even opened) My son had an early morning & afternoon event to attend & I knew they'd be starving . Not only were the pizzas ready... they tasted yummy. Nothing beats having fresh mushrooms.  Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"Yo I've been in Brooklyn for years and now I'm back in the desert. Can I just say Gianna's makes me feel like I'm chilling back east again. Classic rock station playing at an audible enjoyable level. The pizza is pizza and does the trick. But it seems like they have a cool locals vibe and the chicken fingers were bomb as I waited for a car to get an oil change at the nearby terrible herbst. I could hear wise guy accents in the kitchen so consider me hooked.  Had a glass of wine and everything. Now go get your shinebox!  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I asked my husband to get a pizza and he decided to go here instead of our usual place. We will not be doing that again. I'm quite amazed with their ability to both burn the bottom of the pizza and not properly cook the toppings. The cheese wasn't even melted all the way. It took less than twenty minutes to bring the pizza home and it was already cold. It's pizza so I don't hate it, but we will not being going back."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, great customer service. Not a full 5 stars as their sauce was lacking a little flavor and the sauce makes about 60% of the pizza if not more.. 4 solid stars. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Used to go here for lunch when I worked nearby.  I hadn't been in since it changed owners.  The salad was better than most pizza places because it has more than just some lettuce, red onion and pepperocini thrown on a plate.  The ranch dressing is homemade and good too.  The pizza slice came out very soon after the salad and it was huge and good."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to eat here and the food was absolutely amazing. We've tried multiple things on the menu and everything always tastes extremely good. I have never been much of a spaghetti lover but they changed my mind! Also all the owner Victor was extremely nice and made sure everything was up to par. All around I give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"A great place clean and other great options beside pizza. Try the pasta with there homemade Sauce. One of the best meat sauces in town"}
{"text":"For the area this place is a steal. The food was actually really good. I have been working in the area and there are a ton of pizza places but this place was the best for the price in my opinion. I ordered a personal meat lovers pizza with light cheese, a order of garlic bread and a small garden salad. The salad was fresh and the pizza had an acceptable ratio of cheese to sauce. The garlic bread was also good. Will try to remember to take photos for the next review. delivery was right on time I believe. The only thing I would suggest for better service to put a few hot pepper flakes in with the pizza."}
