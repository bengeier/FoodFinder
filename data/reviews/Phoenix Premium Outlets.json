{"text":"I really like this outlet mall, nice to get away from the Ray Rd fiasco.
The only downer is this mall is only open until 9pm.. on a Friday and Saturday they should stay open until 10 and have the food (or a coffee/snack cart) open until 11. 
A splash pad like the one at Tempe Marketplace  would be great too.

Also, I only noticed one play area for kids ages 5-12, where's the toddler area?

It would be great if they added the play area on the maps.

They have seating areas and water features, very relaxing."}
{"text":"Great place with great deals. I'v been coming here since it was opened couple years ago. You can find a nice range of stores, from coach, Neiman Marcus, Kate Spade, Tommy, and Polo and many many more. During the holidays you will find great deals. 

The food courts are located in the far corner of the outlets, there aren't many. Food options are limited so don't expect too much. 

The best time to come here are weekdays, it's difficult to find parking during the weekends. During the holidays it's pretty much busy at all times with a lot of tourists and locals trying to Christmas shop."}
{"text":"This is the best outlet mall I've been to in Phoenix and area! I was there on a Spring Break vacation from Canada Mar 21- Apr 6. The sale prices on summer clothing was unreal. In the Quicksilver store I bought Roxy, DC, Billabong...$12 a T-shirt, $25 pants or shorts, $20 bikinis 2 piece....amazing! Converse shoes for $35, name brand perfume 100ml bottle for $40, Banana Republic - a dress $60, shorts and tops $25 each. I bought a lot of merchandise, even with our CAD exchange x1.3 = it's still half the cost of buying in Canada. Also it was very clean, nice cool misters while walking in the heat from store to store and very nice food court area with plenty of seating. Will definitely make this a regular shopping trip. Convenient easy location as well. 
By the way if your husband is a golfers and doesn't want to shop - the Whirlwind Golf Course next door was very nice."}
{"text":"It's all outside in the 108 degree heat, with the only thing to refresh you are mist fans that only manage to mess up your hair and nothing else. 
It's really spread out with no store that is worth going to that isn't at an other indoor outlet. 
One of the main bathrooms only has one stall and one urinal with a long line out the door. Ugh"}
{"text":"The shopping here is wonderful with a good selection of all levels of stores. There is however not really. \"good\" place to eat. I don't like fast food and the food court section left a lot to be desired. Unless you want a hot pretzel... Those are very tasty.  Parking is plentiful and the overall appearance clean and pleasant. But I hated having to leave to eat and then come back to finish shopping."}
{"text":"This outlet mall is an intriguing place to walk around in, buying various assortments of objects as you go. I am not fully impressed by this place due to a few reasons, but I'll tell you why you SHOULD go first.

Pros:
Walking around the outlet itself is relaxing. The walkway contains tons of fountains, smooth rocks, benches, and trees. There's enough shops to make you spend time there for a while, and sales that will FORCE you to spend time there for a while. Most of the services are very friendly and will not hesitate to help you on whatever you're doing. They offer lots of gift cards and discounts for future purchases, but sometimes all of these deals can get slightly overwhelming, as they ask you for your phone number and relentlessly send you everything they're doing hourly. I am not a chauvinistic shopper myself, but this outlet serves greatly for one.

Cons:
This place is for clothes and travel shopping ONLY. Do not expect to find many restaurants that you know in the tiny food court in the middle of the outlet. The opening hours are very narrow, so you may shop, but by the time the stores close, you may not be able to drop.....yet. 

Overall, Phoenix Premium Outlets is \"premium\" enough for me. I would come here again if I need to, but I don't shop often. And I'm never coming here to eat. E V E R."}
{"text":"The stores are nice but the people around here are stuck up. Even the employees aren't courteous. First and last time shopping there."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever.  Refused to give me Saving pass booklet after I checked in."}
{"text":"This was a nice side stop on our visit to Phoenix. Since this is only shopping place we checked out in Phoenix, so can only compare to what we have in Houston. This is worth shopping for regular stores (ie gap, banana republic, tommy Bahamas, etc) for good sale prices. Would definitely come back. If you're looking for high end stores like LV, you won't find here. I would come back again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! So many good stores that I'd actually go into! Great deals and sales too!!!! Going in a holiday (like Presidents' Day) is great too bc you get even BETTER DEALS! I can tell you I will so be back! Live the NIKE outlet!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  Was having an issue redeeming a Nike online gift card and all the rep kept saying was there was nothing they could do.  They completely lacked empathy or ability to look for a mutual constructive direction."}
{"text":"I love these outlets because they have more stores than most outlets in and around Phoenix. I love that they have a Kate Spade and Asics footwear outlet! They have some pretty great deals at many of the stores (Asics had buy one get one free on clearance shoes, with a good variety of shoes and sizes). I've never tried any of the food court options but they do have a Starbucks right in the center."}
{"text":"The shop selection is mostly highend designers, but some stores that are lower end priced. The designer stores always have amazing discouts (up to 70% off) almost all the time! There is a ton of parking and even covered parking. The food court is nice and clean with a variety of different food options. My favorite is Charley's Steak Sandwiches. The buildings and the outdoor walking area is well kept with little trash around and fans for when it gets hot. Very well kept with lots of great store options. There is something for everybody."}
{"text":"I love nike items. I bought bball tank top. Love it and hella cheap! I got it for $7 and tax. Not bad for a sale item. Def goin back again next time. Customer service was good also. Cashier was helpful and asked if everything is ok. Happy man righhh here lol"}
{"text":"Love this place. DKNY and Kate Spade are my faves. I also like the layout and parking."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now.  Located just south of downtown Phoenix and next to a casino and golf course this new outlet mall is easily visible from the highway.  What I do like about these outlets is they have a couple of stores there that other nearby outlets do not including Tommy Bahama and Haggar.  The Tommy store is great but make sure you hit a good sale and not just their run of the mill 20% off.  The Under Armour Outlet here is very hit and miss.  Avoid it around back to school shopping time as most of the racks are very picked over.  Dining here is not very good with just a very boring food court in the center."}
{"text":"The outlets were much smaller than I expected, but I may be spoiled because I came from Orlando where there are huge and awesome outlets. I was, however, very impressed by the Aldo store's selection and sales. My friend and I got three pairs of quality shoes for less than $100 total between the two of us. 

Also, Perfumes for U had a perfume that I have been looking for for months (it has been discontinued by the maker), and I got it for less than half the retail price. 

P.s. Parking was very easy to find on a Friday afternoon."}
{"text":"As far as outlet malls go this place is pretty alright.  Nothing super amazing here but they have a lot of good stores.  Pretty clean, parking is always crowded but that is probably good for business."}
{"text":"You need to look at the prices carefully. There are some good deals, the others are like regular sale prices at your nearby mall. E.g. Adidas had shorts on sale for $15, regular outlet price $30, regular retail like $60+. Some shoes at multiple stores had an extra 20-30% off the outlet price. Clean bathrooms, ok, food places."}
{"text":"I like this place - nice assortment of stores/brands that will satisfy everyone on your shopping list."}
{"text":"The outlets are great! But please do NOT spend your money at the \"go! Calendars and Games\" toy store! The owner is horrible to children! My two daughters went to shop while my husband I sat right outside the entrance on a bench on this beautiful day. They are 10 and 13. They were told that they could not be in the store without an adult (no sign said this at the door). When they were told this 'rule' and were walking out slowly - still trying to shop - he yelled at them to \"get out of his store - NOW\". What an incredible way to treat children at a store aimed at children! He missed out on our business. Today and forever."}
{"text":"Prior to living in AZ I lived in Southern California and have visited many outlet malls in that state and in several others, this is by far my favorite. I love the layout of this mall, the plentiful amount of parking, the high end stores and the affordable store options that are mixed in among them. There is a small play area and a good indoor food court for when the temps outside are soaring. We regularly visit Coach, Michael Kohrs, Polo, Columbia, Nike, J Crew, Converse and Adidas. I highly recommend this mall to anyone looking to score labels at good prices without the hassle of being in an overcrowded space!"}
{"text":"I am not impressed with this mall outlet and I won't be in any rush to go back.  The store selection is abysmal and the prices of things are pretty much the same as if I went to the regular mall.  Furthermore, I definitely would not go in the summer.  As some of the other reviewers mentioned, it is HOT!  There were very few areas to sit or walk outside that were shaded.  The only store I was looking forward to going in was Coach, but there was a line just to get in!  I decided that even if I found something inside that I couldn't live without, (I have never purchased anything at a Coach outlet), that it wasn't worth standing in line for, in the heat, 7 months pregnant!  There were very few children's clothing and shoe stores (not even the typical stride-rite and Carter's clothing).  We went into 'Go Sports' because my son was requesting a jersey to wear of his favorite team for spirit week....$70 with 10% off.  What kind of deal is that?  Sprockets had cheaply made and priced children's clothing; Hartstrings had mostly Puma clothing for kids.  We left with no purchases, very disappointed, and sweltering from the heat.  Phoenix Premium Outlets better get some stores that people actually like to shop at or they won't be around for long.  I would like to add that Arizona Mills (although I don't go there but once a year) has a better selection and it's air conditioned!"}
{"text":"This isn't really far from where I frequent so I guess for all the other reviewers who say \"it's not really worth the drive\", I'd say for me it kinda was.

Yes, a lot of stores not yet open, but when I did go to find things I was looking for a deal on (baby clothes and a new watch), I found them - so I can't say I didn't see any 'deals'.

Didn't make it to all the stores, but I really enjoyed my Fossil shopping experience (good prices and lots of BOGO offers and 20 and 25% off deals on beautiful leather goods that were in my price range)... also walked in to Heartstrings and found adorable sports wear for newborns for Ross prices but a way better selection and very friendly owner and staff.  Like I said, I found deals for what I was looking for so I was happy.

Since this is close to me, I'd come again... I enjoyed the outdoor walk, liked the store options, and feel like I would be able to find deals here again in the future.

Note that their food-court area is very minimally set up so far..."}
{"text":"Phoenix premium outlets at wild horse pass is absolutely amazing! So much to do for both women and men! and everything is at an amazing discount! Spent just about an entire day here and never once got bored. And even though it's an outdoor mall, it's nice and cool with fans and misters everywhere. Which is essential in this Arizona heat! 

Love the diversity of stores as well. Clothing stores for people of every size, designer clothing and accessories for half the price. Cookware and even discount cosmetics from high end brands! 

Also.  The casino next door where you can try and double your money and come back and purchase even more :) 

The food court has lots of different choices as well. Including some healthy eats. Although I would not reccomend the \"villa Italian kitchen\" but that's another review. 

All in all, it's a great place to spend your day with friends and family. If you don't live close it's well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Customer service level is high. There is a large selection of quality brands, and the prices are incredible. I got average 50% everything. Some items are in regular stores now. This is my new favorite spot to shop!"}
{"text":"It's a drive for me to get here, but it's the best outlet mall in town. As a runner and athlete I appreciate that they have the only Saucony outlet in the state, plus an Asics outlet, Nike, Adidas, Under Armour, and others I can't remember. As an outdoors enthusiast, they have one of two Columbia outlets in Arizona (the other is at Anthem) along with a Merrill Outlet for hiking boots and shoes. There are also numerous clothing stores, food vendors, shoe stores and even a tools and equipment outlet store that sells Home Depot quality name brand tools at Harbor Freight prices. Phoenix Premium Outlets is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Gila River definitely did an excellent job on this one! These outlets are my go to whenever I need something. They have an a lot of high end retailers such as Ralph Lauren, Tommy Bahama, Hugo Boss and many more. I would definitely recommend checking this outlet out if you haven't already. It's an outdoor mall and the landscaping stays true to its location with beautiful streams and ponds along with all the native plants and cacti of the southwest. My only complaint is I can never find any parking close to the stores I need to go to which is understandable for such a popular destination."}
{"text":"Update: 
Starbucks has opened its stand and is packed with happy customers.
Best new improvement - Mister fans! All major walkways have fan-blown misters that cool the outdoor areas making it quite comfortable. Its actually enjoyable to walk around outdoors and browse the shops.

Tip- Pick up the shopping guide (on stands in restroom hallways) for a free map and coupons inside!
Tip- Park in the North lot (near DressBarn, Old Navy) for shaded parking! These guys really understand what Phoenix shoppers want =)"}
{"text":"2/16/2015 - our 2nd visit here and now a couple of stores are standing out as duds, while a couple of others are quite nice. I like both the Gap & Guess stores. Both have some good sales and friendly staff. We've purchased at these stores on both occasions. The Wilson Leather store was also nice, though we didn't buy anything on this trip. 

As for the duds: we've visited both the Puma and Columbia stores on both trips, but they just don't seem to have any good deals and really not alot of merchandise for an outlet store. Plus we must look like a theft risk to the staff there, I assume that's what their awkward stares are for? LOL.  

I'm glad to see the place is being kept clean. There are gangster looking types around, but there is security on site. However,  looked like today they needed some more security,  because the place was pretty packed!"}
{"text":"It's underwhelming at best.  Of the dozen or so stores I wandered into, only the Banana Republic and Sketchers seemed to have a decent selection.  The whole mall is an \"outdoor\" mall, somewhat like Tempe Marketplace, except the walkways are super wide and the shade structures are not well-planned.  This is only April and already it was a too-hot concrete jungle, and the sun was in my eyes for most of the loop.  I wouldn't dare coming here in the heat of summer.  

Also, I've never noticed this problem at other outdoor malls (like San Tan Village & Tempe Marketplace), but I got cigarette smoke in my face about every 20 feet.  Either this place attracts smokers (after only being open a week), or there aren't laws/ordinances here since it's on reservation land.  Regardless it was really off-putting.  I don't think I'll be back unless I want to go to a specific store."}
{"text":"We spent the afternoon here and it was so nice. The facilities are nice and clean and the stores were also well kept. The kids loved playing outside while my husband and i had coffee and it was a perfect relaxing day. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am huge fan of this outlet mall.  This is the best mall to hit the East side since Chandler Mall.  Man, this is jumping and full of great stores.  However, if you are wanting to go to Coach be prepared for a LONG line.  

The worst about this mall is it is OUTSIDE.  I am not sure how much I will be going as the temperatures rise."}
{"text":"I love this outlet mall! Even though it is hot, I usually wait to go in the evening and plus they also have the fans with the misters going. I love going to the Fossil store, Michael Kors store, and the Nike outlet. And the old navy outlet is pretty good as well. That's really all I've been in, haven't been in all the stores, not sure how all the deals are. But I just bought a watch at Fossil that was $165 and got it for only $50.
Love the great deals here!"}
{"text":"Really like the selection of stores. They seem to be grouped together logically as well. Enjoy the healthy food options in the food court but when I want a treat, I wish they had Auntie Anne's pretzels. Also wish they had more covered parking and a legitimate kid's play area with nearby misters like most outlet malls."}
{"text":"There is no \"Premium\" in the Phoenix Premium Outlets. Those of you expecting to find the same premium outlets that you find in Palm Springs, Orlando and Las Vegas are in a for a rude awakening. Unless you consider Banana Republic high end, you can forget it. There are no Gucci, Prada, Diesel, Burberry and the likes. In fact, there is really no reason to come here at all. You can go to any other mall or shopping area in the Valley and get better selection and service. In fact, just go to Casa Paloma down the street on Ray and I-10 and there Banana Republic over there is much nicer. I don't really know who they are catering to with this mall but don't be surprised to see this mall die in 5-10 years much like the Casa Grande outlets. After all, why go here when you can shop at the same stores in the Chandler Mall which is indoor and offers a better selection and isn't much more expensive. The parking is limited. The design to enter and exit is cumbersome at best. There is no appeal to coming here. The owners of this mall better find some quality stores in a hurry or this thing is toast."}
{"text":"I just love it here. Every store you need is here awaiting for you PLUS the casino is right next door!!! It's always clean and if you check in you get a free coupon book which saves lots of extra $! Or if you have AAA; show your card and you will save $5!!!"}
{"text":"If your looking for underwear or socks (and who isn't) then do not come to this outlet mall. They forgot the Hanes or Jockey store or Fruit of the Loom World. Besides that oversight, this is pretty compact and can be covered in 80 minutes (minus in-store time). They have a food court with all the usual garbage and you can get some discounts from customer service with a  YELP check-in.

Important - make sure there is nothing going at the racetrack or else you will be socked in with traffic. Mostly weekend events at the racetrack."}
{"text":"This mall has a nice selection of stores. With that being said I didn't think that the prices were killer. It seemed to me that I can find similar deals online.(I'm a great gonga finder on the web) I went to buy a purse. I tried the Michael Kors, Coach, Kate Spade, and even Saks 5th Ave. the styles that I did like were in odd colors or they had a large quantity of purses that I was not interested in. Kinda frustrating cuz I drovr all the way from Tucson.  I did pick up some clothes that I was buying as a gift and they were decently priced but far from a steal. I would shop here again if I'm in the area but will never go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"We love this mall not only because it is outside but because it has such a wide variety of stores.  The food court is pretty lacking but otherwise it's a great location for shopping!"}
{"text":"Adidas, Kate spade, Nike outlet, and Calvin Klein.  They have them all.  I've only been here once considering I'm a tourist of Arizona in general, well this outlet location had all the stores I needed.  It's a Simon outlet brand which is one of the nicer outlet brands in America. They have one in Hawaii and in California."}
{"text":"Good selection of stores and plenty of parking.  The outdoor mall concept is great, but from June-September it's miserable."}
{"text":"By far the best outlet Ive been too. Aldo, Nine West, Saks, Banana, Polo, Michael Kors, Tommy Bahama, Armani, and much much more. Its all outdoors shopping, so the best time to go is in the Winter or Spring. Easily spent 4 hours here today. LOTS of parking, so that is a plus. 

The location is kind of far from me, but I am certainly going to be a return customer. Love this place for sure."}
{"text":"Came here after a thrilling visit to The Rawhide and was sad to find out they don't have a coffee shop. I think you can get some coffee at the Wetzle Pretzle and Starbucks is scheduled to open in 2014, but currently it is lacking.

The bf and I made a round here and ended up with no purchases (that's unheard of from us!)"}
{"text":"Nice Outlet Mall but not so much fun in the middle of Summer!  I really enjoyed the mister fans! I've been here a few times and I've found some pretty good deals."}
{"text":"Small outlet mall. Clean. Stores are decent, selection could be more abundant."}
{"text":"Love it!   There is always a great bargain.  Terrific stores.  Guess Factory Outlet, Arrmani - even Kate Spade.  Easy to get to and you will save save save!"}
{"text":"Merry Christmas to me at the Calphalon store!  Buy two get two free offers on utensils, baking pans, and knives.  I only went in there for a steamer/pasta pot and came out with all kinds of goodies for a great price!  

Mr. M left me unattended while he went in the Under Armour store.  I started to feel guilty about the pile I was accumulating, so when he found me, I gave him my best, \"Honey, you're the knife expert....what do you think?\"

Big wink here. 

Then some of the $$$ spent was all him!  Yeah.  I'm wily like that.  

Next, he'll be a Dutch oven expert.  ;-)  

The two ladies that helped us were THE BEST!  One gal is truly a knife expert and answered all my questions.  

We cruised through the Nike store because Mr. M likes the Nike free running shoes, but the colors are just God awful anymore.  Are you telling me dudes wear neon pink and blue shoes?  Teal and gold shoes?  Wtf ever!!  Their shoes look so cheaply made anymore.  We'll wait on that one and go to a real running store.  

Overall, I love this outlet mall, but you'll never catch me here on a weekend."}
{"text":"Since the holidays are nearing and shopping malls are going to be booming with holiday shoppers, I thought that it would be appropriate to write a review on my FAVORITE Outlet Mall in AZ! Yes, I am a bargain shopper and this place totally tickles my fancy! They have everything from Kate Spade to J.Crew to Asics. During the holidays they have amazing deals and I have been known to get ALL of my Christmas shopping done in 1 trip! I highly highly recommend making a visit to the Phoenix Premium Outlets a priority on your holiday to-do list! I promise that you will not walk away without some fabulous finds and amazing deals that you won't find anywhere else! You may even finish all of your shopping in just a few hours! :) P.S. I LOVE the Nine West Outlet for boots!!!"}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere. Lots of stores to choose from. Ii explored Lane Bryant and Torrid. The prices don't seem very \"outlet\" but, the sales were great. This could be due to the fact I went the weekend after Thanksgiving, though. Everyone was friendly and very helpful. I will make a point to go back to this location."}
{"text":"beautiful new premium outlets located near wild horse pass. the outlets just opened and boasts 90 stores. 
not all of the shops are open just yet, but many of them are open for business and have great deals on name brand merchandise.
this outlet mall is conveniently located right off of the i-10 on the outskirts of chandler. 
can't wait to visit again while in the area!"}
{"text":"Love this area and the deals I find. Great outdoor area and shopping."}
{"text":"Typical Premium outlet. They looked just like the ones in Houston.
They have misters and a SMALL covered parking area."}
{"text":"This Outlet is very similar to Tangers located near Arrowhead.

For the most part, they have all the same stores with a few exceptions.  Two that come to mind is Ralph Lauren Polo and Tommy Bahamas.  

RLP is massive in size and at least two to three times larger than any other of their outlets.  The selection is outstanding.  From what I can deduce, they are taking their department store inventory and just cutting them out entirely.  The merchandise is marked down across the board by 30%, see photos.

Tommy Bahamas Outelt is new to me, though I have shopped at their stores in Kierland and Scottsdale Fashion.  The quality of their merchandise is outstanding.  Another plus to this location is the Saks Fifth Avenue, Off 5th outlet store."}
{"text":"It's exactly what you would expect from an outdoor outlet mall. We arrived right at opening around 10am on a Saturday and it was already getting crowded...the Coach store had a queue and the line wrapped around the side of the building. The road to access the actual outlets did indeed wrap around the casino and seemed very out of the way, but any moron could figure it out. Clearly they are saving room for expansion or other retail space in the future. Better than dealing with AZ Mills or driving to Anthem for those who live in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Every time I go in there, the cashiers/sales girls always keep an eagle eye on every move I make. There was a prior incident where I walked in and was completely ignored! The manager and I both knew this was an issue. Needless to say, I went in there today, one of the eager beaver sales girls asked me if she could start a dressing room for me, and then that nice friendly blue eyed  manager from a few years ago approached me advising me that the rude little sale girl is no longer with Lucky Brand. I am no thief, it may be that they target certain groups, although I spend an obscene amount of money when I shop, I decided to purchase a t shirt for $6.46 and politely left."}
{"text":"I had a great time walking through this mall this morning.

The grounds were very clean and well maintained. There were many outside staff working hard to keep it nice. 

I was able to visit quite a few stores! Each and every store had very friendly staff who were helpful and happy to be there. 

Coach has amazing sales!! Good coupons and great prices for some high end stuff. 

The staff in Under Armour were especially helpful in helping me find the right gift. 

Starbucks - pleasant staff and very friendly. 

My overall first time shopping there was a great experience and I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Ok they have the normal stores, Nike, Coach, Reebox, U.A., Levis, they have very few out of the norm stores.  They have a Rawlings store but it's not open yet.  That seemed to be a sad theme here, half the stores weren't open yet.  Guess those companies don't need a Grand Opening?  It's a little of a drive for me so I don't see myself going back soon, or not until the whole place is open. The food court was dismal, don't go hungry or thirsty cause there were three places open, Subway, a Deli out of boxes, and I believe a Asian food place.  They have these really cool looking torches burning in the 90 degree weather, & the misters seem to be keep them cool, not me.  It is nice that there are misting fans throughout the main walkways, there seemed to be the complete Chandler & Gila River police force there in case you had an emergency?  I think if you have nothing to do you can have fun there & spend some money."}
{"text":"Best shopping ever!!! Great sales this weekend. Polo and Michael Kors did it's thing."}
{"text":"No displayed pricing on products is illegal!! Fix it by next week before I report you! 

https://dwm.az.gov/resource/pricing-tips"}
{"text":"I have been a few times thru the last several years. I was disappointed as the merchandise in all the stores looked left over and out of season. And that was every store I went in about 7 or 8. Probably won't go back. I'll go to the other locations. Anthem and Glendale/Peoria"}
{"text":"The closest premium outlet to home.  

While some of the stores have not yet opened, there are decent selections if you want to shop now.  Sacks off 5th Avenue, Armani Outlet, Adidas, BCBG, Volcom, and Michael Kors just to name a few.  

Oh, and don't forget the Coach outlet.  The line of sheeple wrapped around the building screams \"uber trendy\"...I bet you can't wait to be the fashionista in the middle of summer to get the made in China over priced crap while standing in 100+ degrees outside.  Don't get me wrong, I still have well made leather purses from them when some were made in the USA.  Compare that to what they $hit out nowadays.

The food court doesn't have much of a selection, the usual crap food you find at these places.  Eat somewhere good before you go.  We did...thank goodness.

All in all, I like some of the stores.  I do find the outlet malls pricier than the clearance section of a regular store.  Just be aware of that and happy shopping!"}
{"text":"Wide selection of stores but prices are nothing to get excited about. Good parking and food court.   Close to nice hotel and only 15 minutes from airport."}
{"text":"We enjoy walking around.  I like the outdoor mall concept.  This isn't a discount outlet so don't go expecting deals everywhere.  Sales are common but not the constant."}
{"text":"I've visited these outlets a few times, and it's generally been a ghost town here. There is a good selection of shops such as Coach, Michael Kors, Nike, Kate Spade and more. Not as big as nearby outlets in Vegas or Palm Springs. But you can find some good deals if you're willing to hunt and dig. Tons of parking and easy to get to from major freeways in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Lots of parking but very few under shade. More trees or awnings are really needed. The stores are well laid out but few maps of the Outlet. They do have arrows pointing the way to various stores but they are only located at main sidewalk intersections. Workers were very patient and polite. More bathrooms centrally located would be helpful."}
{"text":"I love the Premium Outlets! So many awesome stores and lots of deals to be found. Plus, it's not that far from home for me and I enjoy going to different places to shop. My favourite store there is the Nike Factory store and I've bought 2 pairs of shoes there so far!

Every place I've been in there, the staff has been friendly and very helpful. Not your snob store mentality at all!"}
{"text":"I usually come to the Phoenix area during spring training and was surprised to see these outlets when I most recently visited because they didn't exist when I was in the area the previous year.  Stopped by on a weekday evening and it wasn't very busy.  Had fun shopping and bought things from a few stores.  I liked the variety of stores as they had not just clothing stores but places that sold things like kitchenware, books, and candy."}
{"text":"Can't really say there was anything special about this place.  Just another outlet mall.  I like the open-air motif.  Feels sort of European (most shops there are on the street, not in a large mall).  It would be hellish in August, but the past weekend it was very pleasant.

The stores I went into seemed to have a mix of \"new\" (i.e. full-price) stuff and \"outlet\" (i.e. discontinued and/or \"less than perfect\") merchandise. I wouldn't make a point of coming here, but if I'm in the area it is fine.  It would be better if they had a few nice restaurants around.  The food court seemed to be just ordinary food court eateries (though I didn't spend a lot of time looking)."}
{"text":"Absolutely love going to the premium outlets you can find some pretty great deals is if you come at the right time. I typically go to the Nike outlet whenever I go and I'm able to find some really good buys. Children's place is absolutely amazing very clean and they have great sales as well. Some of my other favorite stores are the Michael Kors store as well as the Neiman Marcus which always has a steal waiting."}
{"text":"I got an email saying that from 12/26 through January 7th, spend $125 at the outlets and receive a free $25 gift card. So I did. The very first day of the promotion. And when I brought my receipt to customer service I was told they were ALL OUT OF GIFT CARDS! They told me to come back the next day and there should be more cards available, so I drove all the way back there, and guess what? No more cards! Ever! They now say that once they ran out of cards the promotion is over.

WHAT KIND OF SCAM IS THIS YOU JERKS. You tell people to come for a two week period, and run out of gift cards before the first day is over? And even worse, the customer is told to SPEND THE $125 FIRST, and then come ask for the gift card (oh sorry, we lied! Thanks for shopping.)

Jerks. What a SCAM."}
{"text":"I was excited to have an outlet built near my current location: Maricopa (city of nothing and boredom!). The location isn't really hard to find since it's right next to the casino. When I arrived, I noticed that there's a bunch of parking spots but very few entrances/exits. Might be pretty hectic getting out of there if an event was hosted at the mall. There wasn't really anything special about the stores so I'm not sure why they're called \"premium\" outlets. Most of the stores are pretty common in ALL of the outlets that I've been to. You have your CK, Saks 5th, Ralph Lauren, Coach, Charlotte Russe, Nike, Old Navy, Sunglasses Hut, Michael Kors, etc. I didn't really find any bargains. The prices all seem pretty normal to me, not really \"discounted\" or major sales. I ended up empty handed =(. There's also a mini indoor food court if you get hungry during your shopping."}
{"text":"Super Clean and Nice Outlets!

I do not like shopping much... I am the in and out, get what I need type of guy. That being said, this is really a decent mall setup here.

Super clean everything...

Lots of side lot parking that people seem not to notice so I go right over and park front row!

One of the nicest malls around."}
{"text":"This shopping outlet reminds me quite a bit of the one in Vegas, although it's smaller with less shops. I came with the idea of mainly hitting two stores: Kate Spade and Michael Kors. The Kate Spade was small and was just now displaying items that were at the Vegas outlet back in January of this year, so that was a bit of a disappointment. 

The Michael Kors was nice and had a decent selection so I ended up buying a purse here. Once back at the hotel, my coworker liked it so much he asked me to go back with him and pick out a similar purse for his wife. When we walked inside, we went to the purse I had purchased three days before, and were immediately greeted by a tall, thin Hispanic male in his 20's who worked there. He was nice and helpful, but loudly announced that we wouldn't want to buy the purse we were looking at since it was \"for grandmas\". I'm in my 30's and bought this purse three days earlier and stated as such. He didn't apologize or seem to realize that employees shouldn't talk like that to patrons. 

One of the girls who had been working there when I shopped a few days earlier recognized me and came over to say hi. I mentioned the grandma purse comment to her and you could tell she was shocked he would say that to us. She said she owns a similar purse. The purse I bought was non refundable and at that point I felt stuck with it. Nobody wants to drop $200 on a purse they won't want to carry, and thanks to the male employee here, that's exactly what I'm stuck with. 

I stopped in to a couple of other stores and everything was fine, but the Michael Kors employee and being stuck with a purse I was made to feel bad about before I even carried it (and couldn't get my money back on or exchange) left a bad taste in my mouth about this mall. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Everyone wants to know that when they are shopping they're getting a deal, that's why I love this outdoor shopping experience.  I always find something I like and awesome discounts at Polo, Banana Republic or even the Kitchen store.  My wife and son enjoy Boss and Saks Fifth Avenue OFF 5TH, there are so many other great stores to browse and shop while at Premium Outlets.  

If you have visitors, this is one place that is a must.

Important Tip, FREE WIFI...

Peace!"}
{"text":"Head and shoulders above the higher rated (really people?!!?) AZ Mills Outlet.  I only go to AZ Mills 1x a year, walk around, say never again and go out to find a door dent on my car. So I was beyond thrilled when this place opened up! Cleaner, better stores and worry free parking. I'd love to see some more dining options tho. :)"}
{"text":"We live close by so going there often.
Only thing they have to add is more places to eat ..there is 4 restaurants in the food court and Starbucks and that's about it.."}
{"text":"I came here under the impression that outlets are discount stores. If that's your understanding too, don't come here.  It's expensive af."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of different stores in the area and you can find some good deals. It is a drive from my place but it makes for a fun weekend day trip. This is an outside mall so if you go in the middle of summer bring a bottle of water with you. They have misters set up but it still gets pretty warm. The place is clean and the food court offers a good selection of different types of food as well."}
{"text":"the luggage factory is not a good place to get your travel luggage.  they only give a 7 day return policy and then they don't even do that they force you to take a in store credit.  do not shop there.  go to the samsonite store around the corner at this outlet mall.  huge selection and make sure you try out the luggage and ask questions.  they are a lot more knowledgeable than the cheap luggage factory store."}
{"text":"We loved this place.. We saved a lot of money on back to school shopping.. I have 4 boys so I need to stretch my money. We found good deals at the quiksilver, Levi's, and Michael Kors. We bought stuff at other stores but those stores I named had the best deals!! Especially the survival kits Quiksilver had to offer, any 4 shirts & 4 shorts for $129. I don't mind coming back here again next year before school starts... We're from California."}
{"text":"Great shopping! Lots of clean bathrooms, Saturday concerts for free with food trucks. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This outlet mall is decently nice with a lot of very nice higher end stores. The mall is an outdoor one, so keep that in mind if there are weather extremes going on. I like the mall set-up. The store are lined-up into a large loop, so you can park and make one giant loop and not miss a single store. The parking lot has plenty of parking. The food court was rather lacking for me. I didn't really like the options in there. The food court does have tons of seating inside and some outside. 

The stores here seem to cater to everyone from kids to adults and athletes to the business professionals and everyone in between. I found that each of the stores had good selections and were having sales on top of already discounted prices. Sweet! 

Don't forget to swing by customer service in the food court to pick up your savings passport for checking in. You can stack this discount on top of the store discounts."}
{"text":"The items there  are good 
But the manager(short hair lady)  don't have basic concept of human rights , and full of racial discrimination 
I traveled to this city , I bought two bags , and pay cash , the manager force asking my name and address , also very bad attitude on the whole process . Because I m not white ?"}
{"text":"As far as appearances, ambiance, and cleanliness, Phoenix Premium Outlets is at the top of the pack. With roaring fireplaces, fountains, and stone architecture, this is a very pretty place to walk around. The bathrooms are clean and pleasant. The parking is vast. It's an overall nice place to spend an afternoon.

Where these outlets fall short is the number of stores. There is a much more limited selection on what stores are available. This may be a good thing because it doesn't bring on the mass of crowds and claustrophobic feel most outlet malls in California do. Regarding the stores, most of them are well recognized brands. However, my overall theory on many outlet stores is while the prices may be a bit better, the quality of the products are also usually lower."}
{"text":"This is in regards to the Old Navy store. 
The store was a wreck.  Clothes out of place, priced incorrectly, and the sales people were nasty! 
We traveled down from up north to do a little shopping and only walked out with a few things. 
I can't get over how unbelievably rude the staff was...."}
{"text":"We drove all the way southeast to get here from the west side.  And it is ok.  It took forever to get to the park lot to the outlet.  You drove around in almost a circle to get there.  I think it is make you drive around the casino so you have to think about hum?  So I try to double my money?

Many store were still under construction and have not opened yet.  The stores that were open, the sales were not that great.  

Not sure why we have so many outside malls in AZ.  It is FREAKing HOT here 6 months out of the year."}
{"text":"Large range of stores from the higher end of the spectrum to the less expensive. We headed here for shoes and they did not disappoint in the selection of shoe stores. Everything is obviously outdoors like Tempe Marketplace which I don't really understand, we live in the desert! It's hot outside, I don't want to be walking in the sweltering heat or the cold in the winter. Overall, I would not return again."}
{"text":"Tons of great stores and there is always a sale somewhere! Love the outdoor setting, it's great for the cooler months. There is no way you can leave without purchasing something!"}
{"text":"Great place to visit when looking for awesome deals. I love the large selection of stores. This place is always clean plus they have misters blowing during the summer. Layout is petty good. I can get to all of my favorite stores quickly. I like that they also have covered parking."}
{"text":"We found great deals and had some yummy Chinese food at the food court. I never go there without finding something to take home. Coach always has fun staff and I purchased my first Coach bag finally. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Basic stores. Could definitely use more selections for food and seating area or restaurants around the area. . 
It's good walk around in cool weather but definitely not for summer here. they should invest in shades for shoppers."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a blast shopping through the great deals at this newish premium outlet...not too crowded...up to par with some of the best (could give Palm Springs a run for their money). Found great deals in Banana, Jones NY, Coach, Mikey K's, Sacks....all of em!!"}
{"text":"I have to come here 3 or 4 times a week because what I do nowadays, that's right, but I don't work here. Here somehow works for me. I like it here , a lot stores and good deals, most stores offers military discount as well, this is what I like the most. And to make a better deal, go to their food court and check in you will get a coupon book, say what!!!!!"}
{"text":"Many of these outlet stores are not outlet stores. The prices are at full price. Not much savings to risk something you may be stuck with with no refund policy.  Most of the return policies are just  'exchange only' and NO refunds. Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"I like this outlet, its got stores that frequently shop at. It's kept well and just a nice walk to shop and just spend some time. Since finding this outlet we come everytime we are visiting Phx."}
{"text":"The Phoenix Premium Outlets are new and have much improving to do. The store selection is still quite limited with many shoe stores but not much else. The food court is extremely sad with only one Chinese place, a Subway and recently a Greenworks salad shop and also a Villa pizza. The parking as others have stated is horrible, not many places to park and the entrance to the outlets is confusing. There are many shops that have yet to open and hopefully they will continue to expand. I think that the deals at some of the outlets are pretty good in comparison to Chandler Fashion Center and I would give Phoenix Premium a shot especially if you are looking for sports apparel or athletic shoes. Overall it's still new and could stand to make a few improvements but it is a nice new place to shop in Chandler."}
{"text":"Love this place and in the heat, I literally shopped till I dropped.  Great deals especially at Movado and Armani.  Wish they has a Spyder store like they do in Vegas"}
{"text":"Great outlet.  Many stores.  I visited during Christmas and there were many sales going on.  Staff was friendly and in the Christmas spirit helping to find appropriate gifts.  I visited Coach, Michael Kors and Levis.  I found some jeans at Levis that I have not been able to find at any other retailer and they were on sale.  Unfortunately, I got to the outlet mall too late and was not able to visit many other stores.  However, I was able to grab some Starbucks on my way out :)"}
{"text":"This was my third time at The Phoenix Premium Outlets. As far as \"outlet malls\" goes, its just okay. Its nothing compared to its sister outlet The Tanger Outlets in Glendale. That mall has waaaaay more stores, selection and discounts. This one here in Phoenix i think alot of the stores really dont have outlet/discounted prices. Example: Charlotte Russe here is the exact same store and pricing at any of the other malls in AZ, nothing special. Also, Coach when i first went was offering 80% the entire store...now its 30% on a handful of items. I guess its hit or miss :/ However, this place is super, super clean and really nice to walk through if your just looking to kill some time!"}
{"text":"Went to look, bought some stuff. They really had some great deals. You have to be willing to accept the selection they have but we scored at Fossil and some of the other outlets. It's a decent way to spend the day. Better than tossing your coins in the slots next-door at the casino-at least this way you bring a bag home..."}
{"text":"The outlets are pretty new and there's plenty of parking for cars and shade while walking around."}
{"text":"Happy to find this smaller sized premium outlet mall south of the airport. I came here after picking up my rental car and found some pretty good deals lots of 40-60% off in many stores a few weeks before Christmas. As others have mentioned this is not as big as the Premium outlets in California (Camarillo or Gilroy come to mind) but it's decent for the shops it has. Easy to get around as its not a huge center and parking was plentiful. I've always been a fan of these premium outlets as its high quality name brand items at deeper discounted prices. I picked up a winter jacket at Saks Fifth and some stuff from the Nike Store. When in Phoenix this place is definitely on my list to revisit for some shopping. 

Just a word of mention base sales tax rate is 5.6% on clothing in the state of Arizona."}
{"text":"As all the stores that you need in one place great atmosphere love Lululemon great food places definitely a place to go to with your family if you're in the area"}
{"text":"The outlet mall is good for clothing and other high end merchandise.  However the outlet mall is limited to just that mainly.  Clothing is limited to specific size people other then torrid and lane Bryant which is for women.  
The food court could use more options as well since there's only 4 or 5 choices.  I wouldn't spend much time or money here personally."}
{"text":"I found some great bargains here! Ladies at the perfume store were really fun. Some sales associates were friendlier than others. Nike store had the nicest staff. In the UA store no one even acknowledged us, but I like their clothes and you can't beat the prices there."}
{"text":"The Phoenix Premium Outlets are nice, big and brand new, but not anything that the valley desperately needed.  There are already two big outlet malls in the area, and it feels like they are all filled with the same exact shops.  The only thing this one really offers is a shorter drive for east valley residents.

The mall looks huge from the outside, but it only takes a few minutes to walk from one end to the other.  There are also still quite a few stores that have not moved into their spaces, yet. You'll find plenty of deals, but it t feels like it's more because of a 30% to 60% sale at the stores, not because you're getting something from an \"outlet\" or \"factory\" store.

I'm also not a fan of the layout of the exit.  In order to get back to Wild Horse Pass, you either to go around the Casino, or make a u-turn.  Why couldn't it be built as a straight shot?"}
{"text":"I love the lounging options scattered throughout the mall, the live music was a nice touch, and the mister fans are dreamy, but the store selections were less than impressive. I enjoyed my time there, but I think it had more to do with the fact that it was opening weekend and I had gift cards and other goodies handed to me more than anything else. 

That said, I'm not a big time brand junkie and upscale shops don't tend to wow me. I'm sure there are many who will really appreciate this place. Like the countless people who waited in a humongous line for who knows how long just to get into the Coach store. I bet they loved it.  Me? I might go back for Wetzels Pretzels and a nice misty outdoor stroll, but that's about it."}
{"text":"I think they are the best outlet malls in the state. The stores here tend to have more stuff and they have stores they don't have at other outlets here like DKNY and Boss. Sadly it's Armani exchange now vs regular Armani."}
{"text":"First off I'm not a fan of outlet shopping centers and have grown tired of the over satiated marked here in Phoenix.  But I was talked to go to this location to take family that was visiting from out of town.  When I got here and started to walk around I actually started to like it.  Clean and spacious and good stores.  A little weak on food choices if you are hungry, and no Starbucks as of yet (they are building one) but besides that good choices of stores.  I like it way better than the Tanger outlets in Glendale, or the Anthem ones.  I'll probably stop here on my way to or from Tucson next time."}
{"text":"Great place to shop and a lot of variety. I prefer this outlet over the newer Glendale one because it actually has some shade and better stores. Something the developers should have been more mindful of considering we are in Arizona."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Malls even though it's a bit of a drive from my house.It's a huge space but very clean and organised even the restrooms are immaculate (always a good sign).
They have brands like Micheal kors, coach, Boss, Armani, Banana republic, Ralph Lauren and many others.

Definitely one of the best places to go shopping in Phoenix where you can find some great deals and bargains.There is ample parking space and a few eating options.The Staff in most stores is friendly and helpful.

Treat yourself to a little retail therapy.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"We had a lovely time walking through these outlets. The stores that are here are all very nice and a great selection for adults but there are not enough stores for children and tweens. I had no problem finding places for me to find clothes and walking around in the beautiful Arizona backdrop is a cherry on top. I would really love it if they would invest in the market for the kiddos. My 11 year old daughter loves to shop but the stores she was looking for weren't there. My 3 year old can always be bribed to stay in his stroller with the promise of a toy store but no toy stores either. 

Also, there were some nice choices for drop in, to go food but it would be awesome to have a a couple restaurant options for a nice, sit down lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This outlet mall has a good selection of stores ranging from the high-end Armani to basic inexpensive wares from Old Navy. They also have children's clothing, toys and games, and a book store. We went over the 4th of July weekend and most stores were having massive sales, with some exceptional sales such as Banana Republic with their 50% off the entire store sale.

The way to get here is a bit roundabout, as you will have to drive away from the mall before you start to head towards it again. Although there seems to be a lot of parking spaces, there's just one small section that has covered canopy parking. 

Options for food are a bit limited. So far, there's Chinese, Italian, salads/sandwiches, and Subway. Across from the food court there's also a pretzel shop. There will be a Charley's grilled cheesesteaks/subs that will open up soon, as well as a Dairy Queen (The DQ will be outside of the food court though).

We browsed through a few of the stores, and found a good selection of items for a great deal since there were so many sales going on. Our arms were full with bags after a few hours of shopping!"}
{"text":"This is one of my very favorite places to shop! Love all the stores-- and they have great prices. My kids beg to go here!! Just wish they had better lunch choices!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I decided to drive down to the outlets to see if we could get any shopping done. The first result on Yelp gave me wrong directions, but luckily we saw the outlets and figured out how to get there. Apparently you have to go through the wild horse pass entrance. We quickly found parking and then browsed. I am not a fan of this layout of outlets (no directory, two main corridors, similar to the Glendale outlets). There was one store in particular I wanted to visit but we hadn't passed it and I wasn't interested in walking around until we found it so oh well. The few stores we did stop in had good deals and we ended up grabbing a couple of things. If there is a store you want to check out here, I would recommend it, but I wouldn't race back."}
{"text":"Got an email that said if I shopped after Christmas and spent $150 that I could bring my receipts to customer service in the food court and get a $20 gift card! But when I showed up to claim my gift card I was told that they had \"run out\" of the gift cards, how do they run out of gift cards that THEY issue?!? This excuse is illogical. Please don't send me emails promoting lies."}
{"text":"Let me start off with the fact that it's been a stressful past couple of months and now that I have some sort of breather, I've been doing uhm a lot of retail therapy.  Wait, what am I doing, I don't need to justify my shopping habits.

By a long shot, Phoenix Premium Outlets is my favorite outlet mall in Phoenix.  First of all, it's an outlet mall.  So on any given day, you're gonna be saving on brands like Kate Spade, Coach, Under Armor, Naturalizer, Banana Republic, Gap, Calvin Klein, Famous Footwear, and basically all the big names you see at the bigger outlet malls in California, but not at the ones out here.  Plus it's the holiday season, so dear god, are they slashing prices - I live in mortal fear that the minute I make a purchase, they're gonna mark it down another 20-50%.  Oh trust me, it's happened.

Tip for the shopaholic in you (it exists, don't even try to deny it): Don't hesitate to ask when the sales are, if this is the best price you're gonna get for this wallet or jacket you're eyeing.  More often than not, the sales person will know when the best markdowns are and can let you know if you should wait or to just buy it nowww.  And don't forget to sign up for their emails if you don't mind selling your soul, I mean giving up your email for amazing deals and promotions.  Seriously, Kate Spade just sent out an email last week saying they were taking 50% off all bags and wallets, and another 20% on top of that.  Guess who bought a new bag."}
{"text":"Ok all the bags have discount 20-30% and then + 50%! Is that awesome?"}
{"text":"Tons of selections and clean. Great prices too! Got a cardigan from J.Crew for dirt cheap. Definitely would come back when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Great selection.
I needed to upgrade my typical blue jean and black T-shirt wardrobe.
Out with the black and in with white.

They have a huge selection and all of the best brands. Picked up a few pairs of jeans and some shirts at a pretty good price. 

I'm cheap so I'll return:)"}
{"text":"Really impressed with this place, lots of food stores, good prices and the people who are shopping here keep it calm and relaxed! They are still working on a few stores and amenities but its still great!"}
{"text":"Hagger: Some of the worst sales people ever. The woman working was a complete B**ch. the store had nice suits and reasonable prices. When the sales person is unwilling to let my husband try on dress shirt that is one size bigger became according to her 'we don't open new shirts, just the generic shirts on the rack over there for reference is good enough to figure out sizing.' Well the store didn't have this size on display and a bright yet shirt doesn't really show if the shirt and suit match. Her overall demeanor and starkly attitude was uncalled for and not the best way to sell anything. We didn't and will never buy anything from this store."}
{"text":"I wasn't very impressed. I don't think Phoenix has a lot to choose from when it comes to malls and outlet deals. So if you're on vacation or visiting from out of state, do your shopping at home. I spent way more than I intended which means I did find some things to buy but they were all more than I expected from an outlet."}
{"text":"After our Labor Day weekend stay at the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass and Spa, my daughter and I planned to stop by the outlets before leaving to LA. The last time I was at this resort, these outlets have not been built yet. 

This is an outdoor outlet in the Phoenix sun but the designers/ developers did a nice job in providing plenty of shade and fans with continuous misters to keep shoppers cool.

Found some nice polo shirts at 75% off for my son for tennis and my daughter found a suede jacket and long pants at BCBG  although she was supposed to look for a homecoming dress. They are so \"Tumbler\" she says :o"}
{"text":"Great sales at Calvin Klein and Perry Ellis this week! And I'm surprised to find more of my sizes. All the employees I met at every store were friendly and helpful. Shoutout to perfumania, gap and banana republic who also showed really great customer service."}
{"text":"We usually visit here a couple times a year and always enjoy it. Lots of good shops, and always great deals."}
{"text":"Great selection of stores. High end stores with great discounts when we visited. Generally the clerks in most stores were friendly and gracious. Only negative is food court. Only five choices. Outlet this large should have more choices"}
{"text":"I'm really glad this came to the Valley, but it really is just your average outlet center.  Has all the basics you might want, with maybe a couple high-end extras.  They changed the Armani outlet to an Armani Exchange, probably due to low demand.  But really, there is nothing really special about this place.

Cabazon and King of Prussia are 5-star outlets.  Camarillo is 4 stars.  So I think 3 stars is the appropriate rating for this place."}
{"text":"Best Outlet Mall in Phoenix

Stopped by for some shopping festivities with my wife and daughters.  A little odd in terms of traffic engineering for an entrance, but it's not bad.  And when you're in, it's full of nice stores with good deals and product.

I'm generally not a fan of outlet malls-- few have anything I really would want to buy, some stores have a cheap line they only sell at outlets, and the mall designs are meh.  However, this place is fun to hang out at and show your consumerism side.

Only real knock is the food court only has four restaraunts with one more on the way.  Clean and the options are good, though."}
{"text":"Love the layout stores are nice, good for walks after the hot Arizona sun goes down.  I would advise checking it out you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my new fav shopping outlet, amazing prices& variety. Food court indoors, love the entire place, friendly and attentive employees at stores like Michael kors, Aldo, & old navy!"}
{"text":"I really like these outlets. The location is great; only about 15 minutes from my house. There is a variety of stores to shop in. And, the sales and prices really are worth it! Sometimes you find yourself in an \"outlet\" mall, not really finding any deals. This is not the case here, folks. Each time I visit here, I'm always able to find a bargain. 

One store in particular, I must mention. First, a little history: 

My fiancée has been wanting a Michael Kors bag for a while now. She's not only hinted at it, but it's embedded in her Amazon search history as well. (In case you didn't know, when it reaches the Amazon search history, it's pretty serious at this point 0_0). It's really not like her to buy expensive, name-brand purses, but she was tired of buying cheap ones that lasted only a few weeks before it wearing out. Her eyes were set on \"Selma,\" (to clarify, Selma is a purse... Luckily for me, right?). 

Anywho, we got to the store and were immediately greeted by Alexis. She not only helped us find \"Selma,\" but she also notably discounted the price by mentioning that they price match to whatever we find online! Without this key note, we would have easily paid $100 more for full price. And being as though my fiancée rarely buys such things, I'd imagine the full price would deter her from actually following through with the transaction. 

So, a big thanks to Alexis for the tip! Keep selling those purses, girl!"}
{"text":"We went, we shopped, we eat, we left. I will be back soon...I have that suspect feeling. moreover, there was all that I was looking for. I like this place, however, am going to need to compare this place with other outlets. I'll update my review when I visit next."}
{"text":"I like that this outlet mall had a live band- even though they were playing Country! Haha. Fascinating that they had Nike, Puma, Adidas, and many other shoe stores! More than one selection was fun! Don't forget to bring your fitbit because you will be walking... Nothing major different from other so called premium outlets, but I definitely will visit again soon! Happy Shopping"}
{"text":"This place needs more stores in it. From what I've read it's pretty new so perhaps when I return to visit AZ, they will have better and more stores. I picked up a few items at an ok price but for being an outlet their prices weren't impressive. The food court also really needs some massive help. I wouldn't eat at any of the places here. It wasn't crowded and parking wasn't horrible but I'm from overpopulated, crowded California so anything beats that. Not a bad place but I've been to better outlets with much better prices."}
{"text":"Good place to shop in the Phoenix area. Prices are comparable to other outlets, and most stores have additional deals. Stop by Nike and Converse pick up some shoes for my 2 daughter save extra 30% with my Nike apps."}
{"text":"This mall was recently constructed so it is still pretty clean. It seemed that only 1 out of every 10 stores were actually outlet stores, so not a lot of good deals here.  There is no signage directing you to the outlet, just the main sign you see from the highway.  Once I got off the highway, it was a little confusing getting there."}
{"text":"Review for the food court. Slim pickings and not toooo tasty the Chinese food. I wish there were other dining options nearby."}
{"text":"It was SO HOT. I cant expect much less for it being August in the desert. However, they didn't have the misters on, which my sister said they usually do. I guess 108 degree temperatures don't make the misters necessary. They had all the stores that I needed and an air conditioned cafeteria with bathrooms. It was really clean and hardly any lines because we came as soon as they opened."}
{"text":"yup I love'em.  These outlets are perfect for doing some quick in and out shopping.  They have plenty of parking and it's set up nicely where you can visit even in the hot ass az heat with misters and fans make it bearable to walk around.  Of course it gets busier in the evening when the sun goes down.  If you staying at WHP or nearby go enjoy.  I haven't tried the food court.  They do have a nice Dairy Queen that i tried with my bestie and it was perfect cool treat."}
{"text":"The mall itself is okay but there are only a select few stores here that I like. First off, it's a pain getting in and out of this place especially when rawhide park has an event going on. Lots of foreigners seem to hangout here. Not sure why but there is not a North Face store here but there is one in Anthem. Lots of rental cops hanging out on their segways. There used to be a coupon book AAA members could get at the customer service desk but they are now $5 for everyone. Bathrooms are clean and parking is plenty. The Dairy Queen seems to have a long line in summer."}
{"text":"Gotta say this is a really nice place. A little difficult to get to but the stores are new and clean and a very beautiful. Once the weather is nice it wil be a lovely spot to hang. It has little living room type areas to sit and relax and wait for your peeps to finish in their stores. Love that there is a Perry Ellis there and no other place has it except Arizona Mills. Also has a nice food court with a variety of places to munch for lunch, dinner or snack."}
{"text":"I thought these were supposed to be high end. And I thought this was phase one of five. Where are the rest?  Where are the high end stores?  What stores are here don't have particularly low prices either."}
{"text":"Lots of parking.  It's certainly not on the bigger end of outlets.  It's a clean and well designed outlet. Very easy access to freeway."}
{"text":"Parking is horrendous. Here they are sitting on countless acres of empty desert scrub land and some genius has devised a parking lot so needlessly complex it is a maze of one-way streets.  Ridiculous considering there is nothing but the casino for miles in any direction.  WTF?"}
{"text":"Amazing place to get some shoes or some jeans but not a lot for the ladies as far as the fashion category. Security can be a little bit nazi as far as parking patrol too. Mist and fans make it tolerable during the summer time and it's dog friendly as well!!"}
{"text":"This outlet mall is brand new so everything is clean and shiny. The common areas are outdoors so it is not a pleasant shopping experience in the summer. They do have an indoor food court so that is a plus. Like other outlet malls, some stores are pretty good prices and some may not be. It does seem like they all have a great selection and are well organized and not crowded. I don't think a lot of people have heard of this place yet. I'll write an update around the holidays... we'll see how good of a shopping venue they are at that time!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Premium Outlets.  It offers a large variety of stores, most are \"premium\" or a bit more upscale.  Every store I went into seemed to have a good selection of off price items, and also the regular price items.  We hit this on a great day this last visit, the weather was not too hot so we just strolled and shopped and then ate in the food court.  If you have something specific on your mind that you want to find for an occasion, you should have not trouble finding it here."}
{"text":"I love the outlets! This is one of nicest and cleanest premium outlets that I have been to in awhile. I visit this outlet once a year when I visit my sister in AZ.  It's not as big as it looks from the outside but driving to this outlets, has a definite scenic route of just plain desert.  We even seen a coyote on the side of the road before we got into the parking lot.  They have many stores that my and mom like to go to.  It was a great time killer for us, a lot of the items they have in the Phoenix outlets they don't carry in the Bay area, CA locations.  We went to the Nike store and bought 5.0 Black and White free runs for only $50. All the stores we did go to though, we were always greeted.  Only thing that would be better is if they added better places to eat inside the food court.  Other than that it was very clean."}
{"text":"I am not big on shopping but this is definitely a great place to be. Prices are as cheap as you wanted in comparison to other outlets. However, they do have great deals on sports clothing, kitchen appliances, bed covers, etc."}
{"text":"Mixed bag.

Went to Converse, very nice staff and great store and they honored coupons.
Went to Levis, same thing.
Went to The Luggage Factory. Terrible customer service and didn't honor coupon. 

The story:
They were 3 of them in the store and only us. They had a $10 off $100 purchase. First they tell me not on items on clearance. Fine. Then they said the price of ONE item should be $100 or above and cannot be combined with an add on item. The coupon doesn't stipulate that. It says $100 purchase. After arguing on the coupon, I asked to call the manager.. They said they have already called him and this is what he told me. I insisted to talk to him and they said he cannot be reached. Really? What a bunch of BS. As I needed a baggage anyway I bought one but got remorse. Why do they advertise coupons that they won't honor? It's not for the $10, but for the principle of it, this is false advertisement, period!"}
