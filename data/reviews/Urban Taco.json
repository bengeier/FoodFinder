{"text":"Food was really good. Loved the chicken street tacos and the salsa varieties! But the service was not so great. They nearly lost their minds when we asked to split the check at the end of the meal and were less than gracious about it."}
{"text":"After spending most of our day at the Phoenix Children's hospital we found this taco place and let me jus say we are very pleased with the food and service, our waiter was super nice and a very friendly atmosphere.. the food was delicious! I wished I lived closer I would definitely be coming back even if it's a 45 min drive"}
{"text":"A nice place! Good experience here. Customer service was more impressed than the food. four stars..."}
{"text":"Cool little place tucked away in an old strip mall.  The \"bar\" top consisted of three high wood table shaped in a \"U\".  Neat idea!  The best part....you can actually get a flight of salsa!!  They have eight salsas to choose from and you can get a flight of 3 or 5.  The southwestern had some flavor, but not spicy.  The habanero was spicy but still had flavor.  The Chipotle was bomb!  We also split a taco plate with black beans and rice.  The tacos were huge!  The rice was excellent as well.  The service was great too.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Went for the first time with the family tonight. Such a mixed experience. Saturday evening at 5:30 and only a two person wait staff - for the entire place. Both waiters were nowhere to be seen for such long periods of time - I seriously think they were cooking the meals too, or at least helping out. So the service was bad, but can't really blame our waiter. Only thing I'd hold against him is he was rarely seen and we were given our apps w/o little plates. Food was ok. We got the 5 salsa sampler. 2 of the 5 were awesome and the other 3 were good. Some nice flavors. I had two tacos - Short Rib (good) and Octopus (not good). The octopus was quite wet, the tortilla fell apart and all contents fell all over my plate. Taste wasn't very good so I left that alone for the most part. Lots of good reviews here on yelp. Maybe an off night? Maybe short staffed"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious, happy hour menu rocked!  I recommend the short rib taco and cream corn with grilled onions and peppers"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I took a chance and wandered into this delightful Mexican restaurant. At the risk of not getting a seat in the future with this and other reviews, this will be a goto place for its food, service and atmosphere. It will change as all good things do, but get here soon before it does. The gourmet tacos were literally the best I have had, the staff is not burned out and treat you with human respect, and the price was very affordable. The many, many choices of salsa was interesting and will meet your flavor needs and exploration. Small, small downside, chips need to be upgraded. You will enjoy this dining experience. Michael"}
{"text":"I came here on their opening day in May and the food was fabulous! I loved tasting the different salsas and each of the tacos my husband and I tried were delicious. I especially liked the octopus and short ribs. I've been back since and will keep coming! The atmosphere is also really nice and the service was great."}
{"text":"Two stars because the beer menu saved them. The top 3 IPA about 5$ ea. Damn good. Now the salsas and tacos.... Have you ever heard the term \"white boy tacos\"? These are white boy tacos and salsas. We got the salsa flight. 5 salsas and chips 7$. I didnt see a real salsa in all 7 salsas we tasted. All salsas are, salsa meet pesto and have a baby. Spicy pesto jr.  The best one we tasted was the avacado aoli. I was super stoked about the hatch and roasted tomatoes salsa then i tasted it.... Have you ever left a tomato based food out during the day while you where at work? And you smell that sweet pungent rancid tomato smell. Thats exactly what it tasted like. Spicy as hell but couldnt get over the rancid tatse. Then my better half orderd the cucumber salsa.... Womp womp. Ever seen produce at the dollar store? Wilted flacid soft veggies. That was the cucumber salsa. I wish i could of tasted the salsa freshly made. Now the tacos... The octopus taco bomb. Perfectly cooked octopus. Bomb. Shrimp taco good. The braised beef and the pork belly taco bomb flavor in the meats. Now chicken taco no bueno. Tasted like uncovered roasted chicken left out over night and then try to save it by shredding it and adding some water for moisture. Had a bland taste. The tortillas got hard and dry before i had my second taco. What a shame. Urban taco im a rookie cook my tip is dip your tortillas in the braised beef liquid then cook them on the griddle. Whole new flavor to your tacos. The atmosphere is awsome rustic meets modern. Service was a 10. She was on point. Happy taco hunting."}
{"text":"Dinner was delicious! Service was good! It was quiet and easy to carry on a conversation. Margaritas were great as well!"}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times. There food is amazing and the salsas are so good. This place has a few downfalls though. Everyone that works there acts as if they are attending a funeral. The waitresses barely ever smile and everyone seems really stressed out and overworked. The seating is terrible. If they don't have room for you, they just kind of shrug and tell you to wait for a spot by the door. Not very nice at all."}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos and always great service! It's always nice finding these local small businesses that are delivering something delicious to their community. This is mine and my S.O.'s go to place for tacos in the Uptown area. Their fish taco is amazing, but honestly, so are all the other tacos on their menu. Definitely order extra salsa when you go in so that you can sample several of their gourmet salsas because they are worth the extra $. The owners, who are husband and wife, are always there every time I go in and are very hands one and involved which is nice to see and makes it an even better dining experience."}
{"text":"Terrific food, all the tacos were great especially the octopus. Price was also great and service was terrific."}
{"text":"I have driven past this place numerous times. Today I decided to stop in for lunch. 

Entering the building one immediately gets a feel of urban contemporary.  Great ambiance but not stuffy.

The menu is small but very nice. The salsas are excellent.  We tried five different ones. The cilantro lime was my favorite. 

I wasn't surprised at the prices.  It seemed appropriate for the location. I was surprised however at the portions.  The tacos are served on small shells. The gourmet are about $4.50 each and the regular ones are $2.50. What really surprised me was $2.50 for a non refillable diet coke. Lunch for two, with tip, was $36.00. We also ordered chips. 

I left still hungry but satisfied. The food is excellent.  I will go back but may have a small snack first."}
{"text":"Feel like being called a liar and scolded for requesting separate checks? Visit Urban Taco! Unfortunately this owner operated business is suffering greatly because one of the owners (unhappy looking older gentleman) is insatiably rude and condescending to their patrons. My friends and I haven't gone in months because the service is so slow/hit or miss and I mean sometimes a good taco just isn't enough.  Well this past Tuesday we decided to give it another shot and hit their happy hour for a margarita/taco. Ill never go back it was such an awful experience. We were waited on by two different women, both friendly. When it came time to get our check we first waited almost 15 mins for assistance then were given a check by the male owner with none of our drinks at happy hour prices and nothing split up. I asked him kindly about the cost and said we'd ordered all drinks well before 6pm. I was then basically accused of lying when he said \" theres no way those last two were before 6\"...mind you he DIDN'T even WAIT ON US! After several eye rolls he walked away but only to return almost accosting us to never ask for split checks like that again and that we'd inconvenienced other patrons. I have truly never been so offended at a restaurant in my life and will never return. Thank you Urban Taco, I will never spend another $ at your restaurant nor will anyone I know!!!"}
{"text":"Been here three times since it opened and loving it. The salsas add a lot of variety to the flavors and textures of the food. Will definitely come back and recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"I have been here close to 20 times. Best Burritos I have had in the Phoenix area. In addition, the owners are super nice and always greet me. I am picky but it blows my mind how anyone could leave a negative review of this place."}
{"text":"Great food but poor service. Had to ask for every tea refill, ask to take leftovers home, was never brought bag that was requested. Too bad young lady has not been better trained."}
{"text":"I had the green chile burrito and a margarita...it was delicious! My go to place has normally been Los Taquitos but I think this is my new one :) The owners were attentive and the atmosphere was great. I will be back."}
{"text":"Best food ever!  And love their authentic Cokes. 


The restaurant its self its small, but the environment inside is great!"}
{"text":"Excellent pollo asado street tacos. And the rice pudding is delicious.  I will definitely be back to try their many different salsas."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday anybody? How about some beef short rib, pork, or chicken street tacos? Yes please. Happy hour kicks but."}
{"text":"This place trying hard to get on board the gourmet taco restaurant trend. Located in an old strip mall, they've done an entire renovation to the interior of their space to create the urban-industrial atmosphere they are shooting for. Music from the stereo behind the bar fills the restaurant almost as if there was a DJ in the building. For food, they've got two things going for them: excellent salsas and well prepared meats for their taco creations. With a group of whatever number, they want to start you off with an appetizer of chips and your choice of their homemade salsas. Then you each order your choice from a good variety of tacos. I'm giving them four stars because the salsas were so good and the meat was tasty, but I almost gave them three stars because Lunch for one was $17 (two taco plate and an iced tea)."}
{"text":"Eclectic style of tacos. Go for Taco Tuesdays and you will love all the different assortment of dishes!"}
{"text":"Love the urban style decor- from the tables and chairs to the plates and bowls and wall art. Food was delicious, however, the pollo street tacos- pollo was a tad dry. Otherwise, service and food outstanding. Various homemade salsas pretty amazing. I did not have a burrito but saw them at other tables and they are enormous. They could easily feed two to three people.  Interesting blends of ingredients and flavors. Lunch special pricing, Taco Tuesdays AND Thursdays and other special pricing days are a great deal. I appreciate the urban, Seattle-type themes creeping into the Phoenix area. This sort of restaurant would be a smash hit in Ahwatukee or near ASU Main in Tempe. Outdoor eating area would be a great addition as well."}
{"text":"We loved the salsa flights (sampled all 10 flavors). Nachos are the bomb. Street tacos and burritos were great too. Our whole party really enjoyed the food. Only downer was the limited options for vegetarian and kids."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood!  The tacos are awesome.  Huge selections of \"salsas\".  They are really good, but less traditional than a tomato based salsa.  They are creamy (they need to mark the dairy free ones on the menu) and act more as taco sauces.  The burrito was massive; way too big for one person.  So-so happy hour, but the drinks sound yummy.  Beer, wine, and tequila only.  Super cute inside!"}
{"text":"Great food. Love the street tacos. Well done presentation. Reasonable prices. Street tacos are $1.50 during happy hour. Atmosphere is neither too loud nor too quiet. You can have conversations!  But the food is the reason to come. Choose your salsa from ten varieties."}
{"text":"Great vibe and good tacos. I had the short rib taco. A little salty and heavy but delicious. I will come back and try the lighter fare i.e. Shrimp, fish."}
{"text":"Completely bummed! Being a native, I love good tacos. I feel like one star is being generous.  Uncomfortable bar, owners stared at every bite I took as if they weren't confident in what they were trying to accomplish.  The food was horrendous and overpriced."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorites for a good margarita and street tacos (they are awesome)!  I love that you can get flights of salsa - i've done three and five!
I've been here about four times and will definitely be back.  Nice atmosphere for conversation and good food/drink.  
This is not a sports bar.

{"text":"Great place!! Their tacos were delicious! The waiter was extraordinary and was so interactive with us. We had driven by many times in the past few years and tonight we finally decided to try it. Well I am beyond pleased."}
{"text":"I went to Urban Taco today and got an order to go, they were very helpful and friendly even when I called and add on the order an hour before I was to pick up. The food is awesome everyone love it thanks. The tacos , beans and rice are great can't wait to try other items on the menu!!!!"}
{"text":"It was ok. The tacos were very different and creative. We went for happy hour. We enjoyed ourselves and the drinks were fairly priced."}
{"text":"Food average. 
Service average.

We came in on a friday night thinking happy hour was until 7pm. It was a quarter after 6. I guess it actually changed to 6pm but the manager said in a tone that sounded like he was a little annoyed by us that he'll give to us. Yet, on all the table signs it said 7pm... Maybe try removing your old signage before announcing the new times? So that made things a little awkward. 

The waiter was nice. He kept up with our orders and requests. The food on the other hand...Let's just say if you've NEVER had tacos before in your entire life, Urban Tacos would probably be a decent place. If you have had authentic tacos before, only come here as a last resort. The tacos looked pretty but tasted ehh. The octopus taco was good, a bit chewy. I couldn't really tell the difference taste-wise between the pork and chicken. Actually, it tasted like all the meat was cooked the exact same way so it all tasted very similar (I ordered one of each street taco). I'm glad we got the HH price be cause I wouldn't pay a penny more. Also, how the heck can this place serve tacos and not have REGULAR red or green salsa????? It's crema this or Chipotle that. No."}
{"text":"Short staffed for Wed lunch, so service was slow (owner was sitting at the bar, sort of helping out). Ordered the gourmet taco plate and filling was great, however tortillas and side of rice were swimming pools of oil."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. Service is Terrible! I ordered only 3 street tacos & it took almost an hour to get. They don't acknowledge you. The manager knows you been sitting there waiting for street tacos & just passed you by when you try to get his attention. This is such a small place, I don't understand why they can't handle the crowd. I will never be back here & I would not recommend anyone coming here either."}
{"text":"Omg...pork verde was heaven in a bowl...server was great as well...strongly suggest this quaint lil' place!"}
{"text":"Grilled octopus tacos and salsa assortment.  The salsa is the best reason to go there.  
The salsa selection is just amazing.  Try them all."}
{"text":"Walked into a \"busy\" lunch time. Weren't even greeted but the menus were dropped at our table and the server took off. After waiting 10 minutes and without having been served at least water we took off and no staff had even noticed we were gone. Pricey taco menu. A good street taco is only $1 each. I will never return."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best Mexican restaurants in our neighborhood. The waiter was very friendly too. I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Very cute place--nice feel inside. We all liked the great salsas which were unusual and good! My husband and son enjoyed the octopus tacos, and our vegetarian son said the veggie taco had real flavor and was very tasty. I had a pork verde burrito that was just loaded with pork and delicious. Everything our party of 5 ordered was well prepared and  enjoyed.We all agreed, we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim. Had the Pork Verde Burrito. Really Good! I thought it was cool that you could pick your own sauce for the burrito. Atmosphere is a little \"vibey\" for it's location, but really great service. -Prices seemed a little heavy for the tacos. And, although I didn't order a drink- the cocktail menu looked really good!"}
{"text":"We have been anxious to try Urban Taco......we eat out daily and I am a native of North central Phoenix .......we arrived at 11:10 having confirmed on line that they open at 11:00.....we were the first to arrive for lunch. Only two men were sitting at a corner table.......we were totally ignored, having just come from a spin class we were not at all well dressed.....but finally one of the men stood up and ask us if it was 11:00...... And then very tersely ask if we wanted to eat. He was so rude!!!! I later confirmed he was the owner Ouch !!!!
The food has pretty good over all, but not great......the guacamole was horrible! Very thin and kind of runny.......rice and beans side dish, below average.....tacos, we tried three different kinds were pretty good.
There are so many restaurant choices in NC Phoenix , with more opening all of the time.......why would be bother to return or recommend Urban Taco......Otro is better."}
{"text":"Fun place! I really enjoyed the food and the location. I will come again for sure. Clean location and plenty of sitting room.

Only downside was the marg- not good at all."}
{"text":"This was an accidental find.  It's a nice little place.  The place gives off a comfortable laid back vibe and the tacos are such that you have to savor each and every bite.

Service was friendly and prompt.

The bar is a small but ample selection of wine, tequila mixed drinks, and bottled beer.  All were excellent selections.

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great taco Tuesday experience! $1.50 street tacos were well worth it! I'll be back for happy hour! Also the place has a good vibe."}
{"text":"Definitely would have to say thumbs down for this place way to small and service at first was good but then the staff did a 360 and turned into bi $@# MOOD was really ridiculous they couldn't even provide extra chairs for a group you would think being in \"business\" you'd have a plan B but CLEARLY they didn't it basically like saying to a patient at a hospital sorry we don't have any extra beds you'll have to lay there on the floor or I'm sorry you're sick but since we have no seats in the waiting room you'll need to stand NO! It's called customer service DUDE pull something out of your A and make it work way to go man I believe you just messed up your business! In the end it's all about customer service I think all your staff and including you need to take a few classes on customer service"}
{"text":"The spare rib street taco with the avocado-garlic crema will change your life. Along with a bottle of the Shake Chocolate Porter, you can get a fantastic meal for under $10. Will tell everyone about this place!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for custom salsas & gourmet tacos.  The vegetable taco is more than awesome!  Go during happy hour & add some house margaritas.  House music is customized by Tim the owner.  He knows good music.  Tim's wife Lisa adds a nice touch with flowers at the tables & her flan dessert when it's available."}
{"text":"Our first visit was a couple of weeks ago. My boyfriend is quite picky when it comes to food and I am always on the hunt for a great street taco. We both enjoyed the Urban Street Tacos. We tried one of each (made our own sample plate) My boyfriends favorite was the octopus asada, mine was the braised pork. We enjoyed the warm, salty chips after our tacos to finish the awesome salsas we tried. All were great! Margarita were a little weak, but that is an easy fix. ;-) We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm almost hesitant to write a review because I'm afraid of this place being \"discovered\" and getting so crowded I won't be able to get in.  I've been driving by for months and have been curious but something about the little strip mall was a turn off.  However, one night last week I was on my way home around 9:00 PM and saw it was still open so I figured I'd get some take-out.  OMG!!  The food is ridiculously good!!  I couldn't stop eating it and I can't stop thinking about it!!  I can't really speak about how it is to hang out there because I've only had one chance to go back, and again it was for take out.  That said, the food is AMAZING!!  It's hard to find tacos this good.  I can't wait to go back and try everything!!  So far the street tacos are my favorite.  The gourmet tacos are good too, I just can't really tell a difference except in size and the amount of meat they use (more for the gourmet, obviously...and they don't offer the shrimp taco in a street size).  I want to try all the salsas but I'm having a hard time breaking away from the unbelievably tasty habenero salsa.   I love this place and am telling everyone I know.  It's hard to find tacos this good!  I can't wait to take my friends and family.  I am going to eat here as often as possible!  I hope Urban Taco stays open and does well because it is wonderful having such a great place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Seating was atrocious.  Poor setup.  Chips were stale. Salas were good.. tacos were mushy.  Pork belly was not crispy.  Nice looking little place but would not recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome big instant fan! Loved the octopus tacos

They were done right no rubbery elastic taste. It is nice casual and they all hustle!

May just have them next time!"}
{"text":"I love tacos. They are my favorite go to. My husband loves burritos. So when my brother brought our family here after his ravings, we thought it could become one of our go-to's. The decor and ambience was rustic urban with good music. Service was good as I ordered a taco that has some bitter sautéed arugula on it that made me gag and they let me trade it for another. My husband loved his shrimp burro while my tacos were overly flavored and dressed. I probably would've liked the street tacos better that have more similar flavors. I would recommend La Santisima for the free salsa bar and better tacos."}
{"text":"Great place and atmosphere!! Happy hour is a sweet deal!! Nice neighborhood place!! Will come back!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican food restaurant.  Love the salsa choices.  The chips are great.  My favorite is the vegetarian tacos.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"The reviews seemed to be mixed, but my experience was quite good. Stopped in on Monday night for some grub. Place had some patrons, but not crowded.

Our server showed up promptly and was quite friendly. We started out with Queso Fundido. Their version of cheese dip. It was very good - spicy, but not overpoweringly so.

After that we moved on the obligatory taco plates. You choose either 3 street tacos or 2 gourmet tacos. There are other options, but that is the general gist of the place.

I opted for the 2 gourmet tacos. There is a pretty good selection of meat options and, if I remember correctly, a veggie one as well. I went for some meat options - 1 short rib and 1 shredded pork.

They were definitely juicy! Drippingly so.. That did not stop me from devouring both of them. The short rib was downright fantastic. Well flavored, generously portioned, and just the right amount of spice. The shredded pork was also very good.

In the end, I had a great meal at a good price.

N*joy."}
{"text":"Tacos are good but I feel like they need some other stuff going on here to make me really want to go back.  A lot of the special meat options kind of tasted the same.  Not bad, very good prices, a hip vibe.  The expanded parking lot in the back is nice."}
{"text":"Bad burritos, bad service, bad music. 

Bummer, spot looks nice and is in a cool neighborhood. But the mark was missed in a substantial way."}
{"text":"Great tacos and burritos on the cheap. Happy hour rates are great and generally much longer than an hour. Easy to miss location - worth the stop."}
{"text":"I've eaten here close to a dozen times in the past few months. They've always been consistent in their service and quality of food. Today was much different. 
(If it wasn't for the fact that I've eaten here so many times and walked out satisfied, I would have given one star for today's service)
I ordered the blackened catfish tacos. The fish was burnt. When I told the waitress her reply was \"it's blackened you know\".  Blackened catfish does not equal burnt catfish. To rectify the situation she stated \"I'll let the cooks know\".  I certainly wasn't looking for a freebie, but at least offer to remake it.  Someone needs to reeducate this young lady. Her attitude towards the situation outweighed the burnt fish. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Had Friday night dinner - salsas are great, beer selection is limited and they were out of two select beers.  Music is nice, great relaxing, quaint neighborhood place.  If you live in the area it's an easy walk.  Nice bar area. Had the grilled chicken burrito which was nice, but the chicken is not grilled, it's shredded.  They also put paprika all over the rims of every plate which gets all over if you are not careful.  Will definitely come back soon - bring a friend.  We need cool nice restaurants in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"Tacos were great. Margarita tasted like water and were sent back. Beans were ok, not bad, but luke warm. Atmosphere was very nice. Overall, there are lots of other better options, especially for drinks."}
{"text":"What? Who would give Urban Taco 3 stars after trying the octopus tacos?  If you like tacos and a relaxed vibe, but especially salsa, check Urban Taco out. Much more than expected. And they have good beer too."}
{"text":"First time here. Loved the food. Made well with attention to detail. The margaritas were great not a mix made from scratch. Good service nice place. I will be back. I hope they don't get too busy to get a table because this food will take off. Great prices too. Thank you Urban Taco for a very nice meal."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Nice to have an unusual take on Mexican food in the area! Interesting bright atmosphere with delightful staff and the best burrito in town!"}
{"text":"I was just here on Friday (3/9/18) and I came today (3/13/18)for the taco Tuesday deal and it's closed. Not for the night but permanently! All of the tables and decor is out, no sign on the door or anything."}
{"text":"Ordered Take Out from their online menu which apparently isn't updated with what they currently offer. Their chicken chopped salad was extremely bland and the Avocado Green Goddess dressing was bland as well as not nearly enough for the size of the salad. I had ordered this same salad in the past with a delicious Chipotle Ranch which is now no longer offered. They were kind enough to offer a Chipotle salsa to try instead but upon tasting a speck it was insanely spicy to the point of almost being inedible. Being pregnant at this time I should say that the salad is a decent size and plenty of food but would not eat it again considering the flavor was terrible. That being said, I had ordered a salad for my sister-in-law and it turned out her chicken wasn't even fully cooked with spots of dark pink chicken throughout. As I mentioned being currently pregnant this worries me considering under cooked chicken (or any meat) is a big no-no. This place has changed so much from when I used to eat there that I'm highly disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Cool little hipster taco joint big open room not much of a bar though but probably one of the best octopus tacos I've had definitely recommend coming Tuesday or during their happy hour dollar fifty tacos the sauce are all excellent I had the habanero Chipotle avocado hatch well the hatch was not that good like many places now they do charge for a chips it's worth it though our server was good on top of everything not pushy trying to up-sell any drinks or anything like that this is just a chill place to hang out"}
{"text":"This place is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.... Starting off with the drinks, everything is fresh- no bottles sour mix here... Try the \"Seductive Sip\" or \"Mexican Maid\" - both will impress. Next, try the five salsa sampler; everything was spectacular. Finally, try three different tacos- every bite is different and fresh, homemade and nothing packaged; I still taste mint, avocado and chipotle.....yum!!! Make time to say hello to the owner and his wife- they are always there to make sure you are happy!!!"}
{"text":"Our second time here was a great experience ! I loved the Chipotle salsa... It is not like any other salsa a must try. The chicken in a taco or burrito is actually really really good. 

Our 3rd time here and the braised pork taco wins the prize for best in town.
The 5 Salsa tasting flight was great!"}
{"text":"Great place for tacos. The octopus Assad tacos are the best. Defiant recommend this place again"}
{"text":"This place is not your average Mexican restaurant. The place has a collection of different furniture the menu is simple and the food is first rate. i like the different salsa's that you can order. The staff needs a little training on customer service, a little disorganized, but not enough to keep us from going back. This is a great addition to our neighborhood"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that this (lengthy, but worth the read) review is based solely on the service and not the food, which is great. Unfortunately, after my latest experience, I won't be coming back. 

I've come here about five times and each time the service is never really anything to write home about. The restaurant is always dead and the servers always come off as a little lackadaisical, maybe because they're bored out of their minds, but they're generally friendly. My last visit was so out of this world weird, though, that 'bad' doesn't even do it justice. 

Everything was smooth sailing until the waitress took our order. I got what I always get (which I still recommend if you happen to visit after this review)-- the costilla burrito with the ribs subbed out with beer battered shrimp. When I ordered, the waitress gave me a blank stare and repeated back, \"Shrimp?\" For a moment I thought that I had somehow mistaken my order but then she said, \"You want shrimp IN your burrito?\" I nodded and realized that she wasn't confused about my order, she just didn't think it sounded good which she confirmed by saying, \"Oh, huh, I've never tried that.\" As soon as she left I commented on how strange her comments were but shrugged it off. Red flag #1. 

My date then ordered two a la carte veggie tacos. He's vegan, so he very specifically requested no cheese. Once the tacos came out, we were pretty bummed to find they were smothered in cheese. He decided to send them back and another waitress happily took his plate. No less then 2 minutes later the original waitress comes back and asks if she had made a mistake. We explained that he had requested no cheese and, not that it should matter because the order was wrong, he's vegan. Instead of a simple apology (which honestly wasn't even necessary-- mistakes happen) she then decides to replay HOW she definitely remembered his order correctly and snidely added in, \"It says... on the menu description... cheese...\" Whatever, you're right, we're wrong, we nodded and smiled. Red flag #2.

A couple minutes after that, the two waitresses went to the front of the restaurant, close to where we were sitting, and began giggling. I couldn't tell what they were doing but things were already getting real weird so I kind of assumed they were commenting on the cheese taco confusion. Waitress #1 walks over and says \"We actually are closing at 9 tonight. You guys are fine because you ordered, but just so other customers know we put a sign up.\" This is at 8:57 (hours say they're open until 10 on Saturday) and we still don't have half our order out and the. place. is. dead (like, no one was going to come in). It wasn't so much what she said that was weird, it was the fact she even said it at all. Red flag #3.

I looked at my date and asked if he wanted to just get the food to go. This had all happened in less than a 15 minute period and the strange interactions with this waitress were honestly making us uncomfortable. We requested boxes to go and when she returned with them she said, \"We didn't make you feel rushed, right? You can stay. My manager is freaking out that you're leaving and said we'll comp your chips and salsa flight if you stay.\" Huh? We said no, really, it's fine. We seriously couldn't get out of there any faster. Red flag #4. 

My date and I decided to split the check at my insistence because we had had such a weird experience and I had completely talked this place up. When she brought the handwritten check out to us (still with the chips and salsa flight on it, in case you were curious), there were two stapled receipts on it. After some clarification on which one was mine, my date ripped off the receipt to hand to me. The waitress made an audible sound of disappointment and said, \"Ahhhh, no. You don't rip that off. It's *supposed* to be stapled on there, that's how it's supposed to be.\" We were in such disbelief that a) she was still standing there b) this was even a conversation that we both said, \"Oh... okay...\" Like, what else is there to say? Sorry? She then says, \"It's fine, I'll just re-staple it.\"  Perfect, we would hate to inconvenience you on an evening when you have a total of four guests and are so slow that you've decided to close an hour early, thank you. 

An admittedly less-than industry standard tip later, we bolted out of there and couldn't even wrap our minds around what we had experienced. Of the 30 minutes in the restaurant, at least 15 of them were spent speaking to a waitress who seemed to want to do nothing but needlessly argue, but do it with a smile on her face. Just like Troy Z said, it felt like she wanted to fight us. 

I'm way bummed I'll be missing out on my favorite burrito in Phoenix but I'd rather be burrito-less than put up with service that makes my skin crawl."}
{"text":"This is my go to taco place when I go to work. I have had their lunch special of the 3 tacos and they are really good. Their salsa's are right on point as well. The right amount of spiciness."}
{"text":"Ate there last night and it was good!  The salsa choices are interesting.  Had the street tacos - chicken was my favorite!  Happy hour on Saturday night till 7 -wow!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here during the week and it wasn't too busy, the waitress was super helpful, and the food was great! You can choose between street tacos and their gourmet tacos. In my experience both are great depending on what you want to try. We had the chicken, pork and short rib at our table and there was much rejoicing... yaaaay. But seriously they were great.  

We got a flight of salsas and totally didn't regret it. They were all super tasty and complimented our meals really well.  On the whole my experience was top notch. Good food. Good vibe. Not too busy. Helpful staff. 

High marks. I suggest you give it a try."}
{"text":"First time here, and pretty good! 

I had the chips with 3-salsa flight, and two gourmet tacos with rice and beans

Pork belly and octopus tacos. Both were delicious!

Service was quick and courteous!

My only criticism is the rice smelled like it had been heated up inside a plastic container in a microwave?? Couldn't eat it.

The \"salsa's\" are creamy, so it leads me to believe they're not fresh. They taste good though, so no complaint, it's just worth pointing out for people who like fresh-style salsas.

Overall a good experience and enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and nice little find. Everyone else I went with loved their food. My tacos were so so but I'd definitely come back and try some other dishes. I think I got the shrimp tacos but it was awhile ago so can't be certain."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, as is the drinks and service. We has a wonderful evening sampling a variety of street tacos and salsa. We plan to return soon for another lovely evening. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Have to say I was impressed.  Went for Happy Hour and had a couple of street tacos.  Great Value and realy delicious.  This place gives off a vibe of welcome and comfort.  A place to hang out with some friends on a Saturday afternoon.  I will be going back to try their regular tacos and salsas very soon."}
{"text":"The food was good. We ordered the street taco lunch special with a flight of salsa. Seriously the best salsas so amazing. A few issues are there was only 1 server for the whole place. She was doing her best, but it was a little annoying. Also I ordered the jalapeño and ginger margarita.. nope, don't do it. It was awful. It was obvious I couldn't drink it and my server didn't seemed interested in fixing it, probably because she was so busy!!"}
{"text":"This place was a little disappointing. The salsas are great but the tacos are so soupy and wet that your tortilla falls apart and they are really really hard to eat. The menu looks great but they just don't execute it well."}
{"text":"Love everything about Urban Taco! Margaritas are well above average with lots of flavors. Large wine list. Food was unbelievably good! Very impressed overall!"}
{"text":"Urban Street Tacos are off the hook! In order of YUMMINESS...BEEF, Chicken, Pork and Octopus. The flavor and texture, combined with the sautéed poblanos, onions and secret ingredients make this humble and authentic experience one of the best in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Can you say TACO TUESDAY?!? Urban Taco is my favorite spot for taco Tuesday by far. They have $1.50 street tacos and all of them are amazing. I've tried them all by now. The octopus is my least favorite, but I think that's just because the texture weirds me out l. If your into octopus you'll probably like it just like all my friends! If you're weird about textures I'd avoid it. The braised pork and Castillo are my favorites! I also recommend doing the salsa trio because you can dip the chips and also use them on your tacos! (You get to pick ones also with your tacos regardless I think but I like variety and I LOVE salsa). I like the habanero, chipotle, and roasted hatch chile. None are really that spicy but I also have no taste buds when it comes to spice so try at your own risk. Also have pretty good margaritas they are made with real lime and not sweet and sour!"}
{"text":"Pass by this place all the time and have been wanting to stop in.  Finally found the chance, wish we hadn't!  First off, the place inside is very nice.  Hip, uptown feel, very trendy.  The staff was friendly enough, not overly like some places.  The man who I assumed was the owner from what I was hearing was friendly and helpful with a few questions.  But the woman who I assumed to be his wife was not so much.  Not welcoming or friendly AT ALL.  Just because of that I didn't even want to order, such an unpleasant person.  Anyway, we stayed.
Ordered tacos, they have four kinds.  None of which were very good, the pork was halfway tolerable, but the others!  OMFG!   Especially the octopus, I know, Octopus?!?!?!   Who makes frickin' octopus tacos, really?!?!  But, we had to try them anyway.  After all, they have this nice place, someone has to like them I thought, right?  WRONG !!!  Not only were they the most horrific thing I have ever eaten.  I, involuntarily, did my Karen Carpenter impression 
and heaved up that and everything before it!  Oh, and did I mention the rice?  What rice?  The burnt rice!  Awful!   It was just awful!  And the beans tasted like fritos bean dip, which I like.  But I don't like watery fritos bean dip, black fritos watery bean dip!  yuk Yuk YUK !!
Suffice it to say that we won't be going back any time soon, or more to the point - EVER!!
And for a few tacos, rice and beans it came to $30!  I mean, that could have bought 60 tacos from JACK- which would have been a lot better by comparison.   Sorry, but all in all, this
place gets the thumbs down from me.  The one star is for the location and decor only, that's it.
I hope this review doesn't sound too harsh, but I just can't believe how this place can peddle such awful food and then present you with a check as if it has been made by Martha Stewart.
All with a straight face, unbelievable !   Should have waited for the taco truck !"}
{"text":"So, I have gone here twice now and had the luxury of being able to try 4 different burritos. The first time when we pulled up we noticed that there was no one else there and it was about noon. Which was kind of weird so we sat in the car for about 5 minutes, no joke, and tried to decide if we should go in. You know, cause it's always a little iffy when there's no one in a place around that time. Anyways, thank goodness we decided to go in! Wow!! 

The place is quite rustic but modern as well and the tables look like well crafted pieces of furniture that look homemade. Same goes for the food! I went with 2 co-workers and we decided to each get a different burrito and cut them in thirds and share. Best idea ever! The three masterpieces were the Costilla, Pollo Asado, and the Pork Verde burritos. The burritos are both packed with flavor and meats and cheeses. They are also grilled which gives then a very nice texture as you take your fork and knife to them (yes they are that big and need to be eaten with a fork). My favorite of those 3 was the short rib, but I would get either of the 3 again, and again! We also sampled 3 of their salsas with chips and all were very flavorful. Some are cream based and some just look/feel cream based because they emulsify them in the blender. 

Well, decided to get some to go a second time a few weeks later and just as impressed as I was the first time. The Baja Shrimp burrito was flavorful and the shrimp was cooked perfectly and wasn't overpowered by the other flavors. 2 different coworkers got the Pollo Asado burrito and the street tacos and both raved about how much they liked them! 

Needless to say, we will be going back. Probably at least once a week as a group. And I may even go again on the weekend! Well done urban taco, well done."}
{"text":"Stopped in out of curiosity. Pass by almost everyday. I am a taco and margarita maniac. The $1.50 taco Tuesday/Thursday is awesome! I tried all four...beef, pork, chicken and octopus. Then the owner came in.  Spoke with him, he suggested some of the regular tacos...veggie and blackened catfish. Both were amazing! Margaritas are great...not too sweet. Most places make them too sweet. They have an incredible assortment of salsas...10 or more. We tried 10. From habenero salsa to corn salsa, all smooth  in texture. I could literally drink them all. Friendly staff. All around 5 star experience! As you can see by the photo, we devoured it all.

Update...Nov 17 2016

This place is still great. Been here many times since I posted the review."}
{"text":"I just came in with some friends and enjoyed the atmosphere and service. I ordered 3 pollo asado tacos with chimichurri sauce and it was delicious! I would recommend this place to anyone who likes fresh food with no fluff."}
{"text":"The Octopus tacos are so good! On the minus they advertised $5 margarita Monday's but didn't tell us it was only the classic margarita that was on special."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! I had a bean and cheese burrito - wonderful option for vegetarians. We also had five different salsas which were all excellent. The flavors are amazing. The only negative thing about the experience was the customer service. The wait staff could have been more personable. It was happy hour but she didn't mention it at all. Aside from that, I recommend it!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food here. The salsa flight is a pretty rad idea. We got the 3 flight and enjoyed all of them! I had the pollo and octopus street tacos and they didn't disappoint. Pricy for street sized tacos so during happy hour would be the time to get more than two for a good price. Only gave it 3 stars because the service was bad. Our waiter seemed very uninterested in helping us or serving us. Like we were a bother to him, and they weren't even busy so he was not rushed by anything. It's hard to enjoy a place fully when the service is crappy."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to try this place and on my way to work from a midday appointment I stopped in and order take out.  I waited for about half hour and then got my order. My order was two tacos, rice and beans, when I started eating the tacos were okay but what turned me off was the burnt rice that they gave me and the beans were so, so.  I will try to give them a chance again, hopefully I will get a better meal."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. We ordered the salsa flight which was good. Then ordered the tacos and a burrito. The pork was pink and undercooked. When we sent the plates to the kitchen so they could see it the owner/chef came out aggressive and confrontational. In all my years of waitressing, bar tending and being a restaurant manager (and having to deal with these issues) I have never attacked a table in the manner he did. We will never be back."}
{"text":"Urban Taco
There's absolutely nothing \" Urban \" about this restaurant. Upon arrival there was a really sweet woman who immediately got us seats at what appeared to be the bar. We shortly were greeted by a polite man who brought water and menus. We ordered two beverages a sangria and a jalapeño ginger margarita with a 3 cart flight of Salas's, which were all bland and horrible...the 3 Salas's we received were a flat based condiment... with nothing containing the basics of a Salas, Salsa is often a tomato-based sauce or dip that is a heterogeneous mixture that includes additional ingredients such as onions, chilies, beans, corn, and various spices. It is typically piquant, ranging from mild to extremely hot. These were nothing of the sort. My sangria came from a container on the bar and it was good.  My partners margarita came from the back, the kitchen not the bar, which I thought was odd. & it tasted absolutely horrible. There was no option to select the type of tequila in the beverage... so that was a red flag. I'm a carne asada fan so I ordered a Ny strip steak taco and one polo asada chicken taco... my partner ordered a Baja shrimp and a polo asada chicken taco as well. Shortly after a Latin man brings out our food and I'm immediately taken back by the soup inside of the carne taco. I open the \" NY strip steak \" taco and it's full of a soupy substance of chopped meat squared meat and onions with a extremely thick sauce, Salisbury steak made in a crock pot is what it tasted like. The meat was not in strips it was in square chunks and it was horrible. I couldn't believe someone put this in a taco shell. I was so taken back I made my partner try it and she immediately began to laugh... it was not acceptable to be called  \" NY STRIP STEAK \" was in a soupy like base masked in a heavy brown sauce and onions. It was absolutely horrible. The chicken taco was bearable but extremely bland, but I had a decent sangria to wash it down with so I was able to stomach it. Upon asking for the bill the gentleman who took our order realized I didn't do anything but pick through the \" NY Strip Steak \" taco and my partners untouched chicken taco. He asked if I didn't like it, I politely said no, and he asked if I wanted to take it home & \" doctor it up \" i politely let him know there was nothing I could do to \" fix \" that taco..  he offered to remove it from the bill, which I declined, he removed our plates and brought us a hand written bill. We paid our tab & headed out discussing where we were going to go eat. I found this joint on yelp & it was highly disappointing. Anyone who enjoys street tacos, carne/steak tacos, chicken tacos or any tacos for that matter. Don't waste your time at \" Urban \" taco \"  it's horrendous."}
{"text":"Had to drop off a vintage amplifier around the corner at Dynatronix and they recommended this place for the gourmet tacos. Had one pork and one shrimp, probably the best tacos ever says me who os a taco whore! Unfortunately i live on scottsdale so it is a trek for me but will make the effort."}
{"text":"Great new place, with a relaxed atmosphere and a bit trendy ;) love the Baja shrimp gourmet tacos and the salsas are fab!"}
{"text":"Excellent 3 taco plate and a flight of salsas. Loved the octopus and the pork! Great waiter, casual environment.

Update 6/21/17. Got there at 4:00 for happy hour 3:00-6:00. Waitress told us to sit anywhere we liked. Bartender came and got our drink order and the drinks came out. 10 minutes later the waitress left (for the day since apron was in her hand) without saying a word and we hadn't placed our food order yet. Finally the only employee left besides the cook (the bartender now waiter) took our order about 4:15. Needless to say I knocked their review down. Also - had to ask him which salsa was which on our flight, as they were all the same color. Definitely not the experience we had the first time. Sigh...."}
{"text":"Pretty good street tacos I'd say the pork tacos are the best, but the black beans and rice stole the show! The 3 street taco plate seems a little pricey just for 3 but we'll definitely be back for those beans and to try the Taco Tuesday Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food, environment and the staff are perfect! The tacos here are very delicious! Not only can you get them at a deal on Taco Tuesdays, but you can get them Tuesdays AND Thursdays!! Corynne was my waitress and she was perfect! I recommend this place to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Tacos were delicious! I can say prices were good too! It was a little bit awkward that our waitress was going off (yelling and crying) in the kitchen with another guy (maybe the manager?) - it was embarrassing I can say."}
{"text":"The service was better this time but now there was no flavor in the food. It was a large salad with tons of fresh veggies but no seasoning on the chicken. Even the green goddess dressing was bland. I've tried this place four times. Won't bother anymore."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! For how hip the inside is, it's in a really outdated plaza, so do not be fooled by the outside appearance. 

I Ordered a trio of three of their salsas with the chips and they were all super tasty. Really great appetizer that lets you get a taste of a lot of their different salsas. 

I got the urban street tacos for my main course (if you order 3, it comes with rice and beans). Despite the fact that they were really small (which is expected of a corn tortilla), they were super tasty! I liked the short rib one a lot. 

Service was great and I'm excited to come back for happy hour or taco Thursday/Tuesday!"}
{"text":"We went with a group of six and had a variety of food. Everything was amazing!!. Probably the best margaritas I have ever had. The tequila is a very nice house blend. Service was excellent and establishment was clean.!! Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Finally ate there last night and loved it.  The place is charming the food was great but no desserts so that's why not a 5 star rating.  The tacos were bigger than I expected so next time I'll just order 1 and not 2.  I can't wait to go back and eat there again."}
{"text":"We ordered  guacamole, it had too much lime juice and was a little  sour, they provide  corn chips instead  of flour  chips . There was no salsa offered . We had both tacos and burritos. I tried the pork and green sauce, it was way salty, they do have a good special  on Sundays. Service  was a little  slow . They also added our bill wrong . Most of the food was way salty.it was very quiet"}
{"text":"It was a nice small local joint, with a fun ambiance. The tacos were really yummy (we had the basics-pork, beef, chicken). The margarita was nothing special, but not over priced. Friendly staff and the food came out pretty quickly. It's great since we live down the street! Great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I OWE THIS FIND TO YELP! Yet again. Duh.

I was visiting with a girlfriend who is ALMOST about to have a baby girl and we were in the mood for something spicy! ;) So...

I pulled out my handy Yelp app and what did I find? URBAN TACO! Better yet? It was Thursday and they have $1.50 street tacos on Tuesdays & Thursdays. CHA CHING! We were there in under 5 minutes. Another amazing thing about UT is that they have about 10+ different salsas to try and if you're a sauce lover like me, this is a dream come true! We ordered their chips and salsa flight - duh, a must. You can choose 3 or 5 but of course we chose 5 and that was even hard to do! Every one of them sounded fab. We met the owner/chef himself and he makes all of his salsas from scratch. You really cannot go wrong with any of them but my two favorites were the chimichurri and hatch chile salsa. I loved their thin and crispy chips too.

I ordered 3 street tacos and we split a side of rice and beans. Everything was INCREDIBLE! Let me tell you, i'm bringing my hubby back here ASAP. Not only was everything homemade with love but the prices are so great - for two of us to eat A LOT and a glass of wine, our bill was $30. Is this real life? Local taco spots are charging out the wazoooo these days, but not Urban Taco! Did I mention their adorable, rustic decor with fresh daisies on the table? Love! See you soon!"}
{"text":"Wow, I have driven by here a million times and never stopped...until tonight. I was greated at the door and seated, with a drink arriving immediately.  The Chipotle salsa and green Chile garlic salsa were great. I had 2 tacos: Baja shrimp and the short rib. The savory, tender short rib taco was perfect! The Baja shrimp were lightly battered and cooked juicy and tender. I will  be back.  What a treat!"}
{"text":"Nice place fresh feeling casual atmosphere. Hip but not too trendy. We went on a Saturday 2 pm. Nice waiter quick service. We had tacos are Gourmet larger with more on them or street tacos smaller. $4.95 for gourmet taco $2.50 for street. (Note they have a happy hour $1.50 for street tacos) we had a steak, chicken and pork taco. What makes these stand out is the killer salsa added to each kind of taco they have 8 or so salsa's all fresh made and wonderful. Meat is excellent and they use queso fresco all in all we recommend the tacos highly. They don't disappoint. This would be a 5 star if the rice and beans were better, just OK. But no problem order ala carte."}
{"text":"Was so excited to have a gourmet taco shop within walking distance! Stopped by today to pick up take out and try it out. 
Mmmmmm .... mixed reviews.
It's very cute inside.
The menu isn't as interesting or \"gourmet\" as I was expecting. And it's expensive for what it is. $5.75 for a bottle of Kiltlifter is a lot. Tacos were $2.50 for street and $4.75 for gourmet. Ouch! I had two short rib street and one braised pork street taco. Liked the poblano strips, but it lacked little flavor without the salsa. The selection and tastes are much better at Taco Guild if you are seeking gourmet.
May try it again, but definitely on HH when the street tacos are $1.50 and beer a dollar cheaper."}
{"text":"Their tacos are really outstanding but their wine list and margaritas not plentiful or that good. However nice environment and their 5 different salsas w chips--wonderful."}
{"text":"The food tasted great. However the service was awful. Our waiter scolded us for asking him to split the check. We were all in disbelief and couldn't believe it was happening."}
{"text":"This place is really a hidden gem! We discovered it just driving by and went in on a whim. The server was very polite and helpful. The atmosphere was so dope! Unique decorations and all! The food there was to die for. Really mouthwatering! It was definitely cooked to perfection and there are many options. All in all I'd go there again and even make it one of my go to places!"}
{"text":"I found Urban Taco to be a bit lacking in terms of flavor. 

I stopped in recently for dinner with a friend and we settled in a corner for a drink and some chips and salsa before placing our orders. 

The girl working there was on her own, playing bartender and server. She did a good job, all things considered. As far as the tacos are concerned? I had the street tacos and wasn't blown away by them the way I was hoping to be. 

Because we did show up a bit later, we did soon realize that we only had so much time before they closed. However, the bartender/server let us stay an extra 30 minutes instead of kicking us out while she cleaned and closed up shop. I thought that was a nice gesture. 

Would I come back? 

I'm not sure I would. The restaurant competition in this area is stiff and there are a lot of \"no-brainer\" options in the area. I'm not sure this is one of them to be honest."}
{"text":"Went for lunch - cool building - neat vibe.

We got a 'flight' of salsas and I ordered a two-taco combo.

The 3 salsa flight included tomato/poblano, green chile, and Hatch chile - (listed in descending order of favor).  The tomato/poblano tasted like what you expect salsa to taste like.  The green chile was pretty good, but I wasn't a fan of the Hatch - it had an almost fermented aftertaste - just not my thing.

For the tacos, I got a Costilla (short rib) and a fish taco.
The presentation was really nice, but...
The Costilla was (continuing my unfortunate theme for the week) - bland.
The fish taco kind of made me think I'd ordered fish and chips and they didn't have any malt vinegar - once again, bland.
On to the black beans and rice...you guessed it...bland.

Not what I was expecting.  It was good, it was well presented, everyone was nice, but I was looking for more kick."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the food here. The ambiance is very cute, shabby chic, and modern. Very small but I enjoyed all that. The drink and  food prices were ok. Average I'd say.  The food was just a bit bland. My husband and I tried 4 of their tacos. 2 different pork tacos, one had potato in it and that one was the most flavorful one we had. One was a \"New York steak\" taco with very little flavor. And lastly the Baja shrimp taco... No flavor. However, I did like the way the shrimp was cooked and the size of the fillings that come in the tacos . The rice and beans were pretty tasty. The cup of creamed corn was the best thing we all had. Our friends got the sample of salsas. They were fun but also lacking flavor. Service and staff were nice. Restaurant and restrooms were clean and cute. I guess this is just not my type of Mexican food. I would give it a try and see for yourself. But as for me, I won't be back for the tacos. Maybe just a drink at their cute bar and a cup of cream corn."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. Our waiter was incredible, his name is Sam. He was one of the best waiters I have had. The atmosphere is much much better than I expected. I will definitely come here again, probably very frequently.  Every single salsa was great. My burrito was perfect. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"good tacos the chicken was a little dry and could have came with a lime ...wife had the pork burrito and said she would eat here again and that's something to be said by her lol.. excellent service and fast very and clean"}
{"text":"The food here really wasn't that bad. We can with a group of about 8 people on happy hour. My wife ordered a few of the tacos. All were decent except for the octopus. 

I had the shrimp burrito which had great flavor. It tasted almost like a shrimp scampy burrito, very garlicy and buttery.

However, the service was some of the worst service I have ever received. They had two people working the entire restaurant and the server was so incredibly rude to us, it was actually kind of awkward. I thought she wanted to fight me or something. That left a really bad taste in my mouth (figuratively). I may be open to trying this place again, but with Otro right up the road, probably not."}
{"text":"Hmm, as a server/ manager/ been a bartender before. This place is very unfriendly.   The food is alright.  #I should have gone to Sprouts. I was going to make my own dinner, but This place caught my eye.  First and last time.  Sorry, not impressed. If you (the bartender) are the owner, I suggest you don't come to work and let everyone else handle it.  The girl that took my credit card was nice."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had been lusting over this place ever since we found out that they offered octopus tacos... I will quickly add that tacos are one of  my favorite kinds of food, so I've tried a lot. Anyways, I ordered 5 kinds of tacos and none really wowed my boyfriend and I, even the octopus which I couldn't wait to try. I had a pork taco with potatoes...I couldn't even pull myself to try because it was DRIPPING with cheese...and I love cheese, but it was over kill!!!The shrimp taco with truffle butter also sounded like a good idea but the flavors came in layers; first, all I could taste was butter, next it was cheese and finally just mushrooms...the flavors didn't work well together, this just didn't work for my palette. 
I'm giving it 3 stars because it had a nice environment, good servic, but the food just didn't work for my palette BUT I feel like it was more of a preference thing rather than a bad food thing if that makes any sense.
ALSO...if you do decide to visit try the chips and 5 salsas!!! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighborhood and we tried out Taco Tuesday. The building is fun and has a good vibe. Wait staff were friendly and the tacos were creative. I prefer the salsas a Joy Ride, but the tacos were great here and the prices were more than fair."}
{"text":"The rice and beans were great, and the servers were friendly but the meal was just ok. My advice, flip the menu over and go for the street tacos. Better price and better portion size."}
{"text":"Small and quaint with excellent decor! I can not remember the last time I had a meal with every bite tasting so flavorful and fresh. Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"The staff was so friendly and welcoming. Our waitress went over the menu with us as it was our first visit but definitely not our last. The food was delicious. Very modern yet authentic takes on the different fillings for tacos and burritos. Im definitely going back for taco Tuesday and Thursday for the $1.50 street tacos from 3-9p. Baja shrimp taco was just like the taco stands in Mexico with fancy style pico (cucumbers were very light and airy, tomatoes petite and sweet). Nachos had a creamy homemade nacho cheese and we has the beef short rib meat which was smokey and spicy. Try this place, you will love the food. Burritos are 13.50 and the large tacos are 6.95 each (fully loaded too). Enjoy friends"}
{"text":"Wow...one of the best burritos I have ever tasted!  Good service, nice, cozy atmosphere and downright tasty food.  We enjoyed the pollo burrito and are still talking about it a week later...it was that good!  We will definitely be back and you should get yourself there quickly too."}
{"text":"Tackiest place/service I have ever been to! A party of 4 people all spent at least $100 together with $15 tip. This heavy set waiter told me that because I had more to drink I had to give him a more of a tip because he only makes $5 hourly and what we initially gave him all together was not enough that he needed at least 18% tip all together. Excuse me per the stare of Az its 15%, not 18% and second of all a tip is gratituity not a requirement. He wouldnt leave our table till we all forked over at least $22 dollars. Keep in mind we were all women and felt very uncomfortable at this point. It a shame food was good and drinks, but if your server is a jerk might as well throw everything out."}
{"text":"I recently stumbled on this place and love it. If you like Octopus, you will be happy to know the meat is cooked perfectly (not rubbery at all). I have tried the street tacos and gourmet. The gourmet veggie taco is the absolute best. Even if you are a 'meat' person, you will be surprised at how delicious and filling these are. I see a lot of negative reviews on the price and I am wondering where these people eat. You can get two large gourmet tacos, rice, and beans for like $10. It's inexpensive for the quality, freshness, and amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my hubby and my 10 month old. The server was very nice, quickly brought out the high chair and recommended their specialty margarita-that was DELICIOUS!!!  All the tacos we ordered were really good. The octopus, chicken and rib were to die for. The sides of grilled onions and creamed corn were super delish and super cheap. A winning combination of you ask me. We live in the neighborhood and will for sure be back. 
p s.  Even the baby loved the small bites he got to munch on...."}
{"text":"So so so good! I will be back. Very friendly server. Get the flight of salsa. The chimichurri sauce is to die for"}
{"text":"I love urban taco! Grab a flight of salsa and chips, a margarita and some happy hour tacos"}
{"text":"Happy that my first Yelp review is of this great new place. It's amazing what they have done with the space that used to be a bakery. Very, well...urban...comfy seating. I had the 2 taco plate, veggie and the shrimp, and my friend had the shrimp burrito. Portions were ample and the taste of everything, including the salsas and chips, was fantastic. Our waiter was very nice and helpful. I LOVED their chimichurri. This is a great addition to the neighborhood. Looking forward to checking out their happy hour."}
{"text":"Awesome Skinny Margaritas and Queso. All food is excellent and service is always good. Will keep coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I am honestly flabbergasted and perplexed about this place. They had all the right ingredients to make such a great culinary impression, but this totally fell flat with both my wife and I.

We figured that since the parking lot was full, and that the place was packed with customers that this had to be a haven for \"urban tacos\" - right?

The decor and ambiance are quite inviting and comfortable. The lighting was just right The service prompt and efficient. Definitely and solidly \"urban.\"

What could have possibly gone so wrong to warrant a 2-star rating from us?

It was the \"taco\" part that got us. No matter how much we tried to really like the food, we couldn't get ourselves to enjoy any of the various options we tried.

The salsas had no distinction, and seemed watered down. The chips tasted completely bland. And none of the tacos even got a rise out of us. We figured ordering the New York strip taco would have a nice meaty flavor, but after being bathed in what sauce that was, totally eviscerated any traces of a good beef flavor.

The Pollo Asado didn't taste like chicken, and the chicharrones were soggy, so they didn't have that crunchy flavor that I am normally accustomed towards. My wife actually asked to have her dinner packed up after just a few bites. 

I gave my tacos the good ol' college try, until I just had to hang it up and go back to the locker room.

We have had such great recent experiences with the tacos served in various parts of the valley, that we had high expectations about this place. Unfortunately, we were sadly disappointed with the eventual outcome of our respective meals."}
{"text":"Top notch American/Mexican food. Small cozy vibe on the inside. Food was pretty good. Burritos are a must have. Try a couple different ones to find your favorite. Different tastes but unique and tasty. 

Kind of a hidden gem. If you go during a rush you might want to head somewhere else. Just because of the size of Restraunt and staff. I would recommend to friends to try it out for sure."}
{"text":"Love this haven of Mexican bliss!     Best Mexican grub in the city!!    Holy Moly.   This place is a proverbial unicorn!    Too good to be true.  Jonathan is legit.    DADGUMMIT if he's not the cutest thing ever."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I went her for lunch and both loved our dishes.  We both got two tacos.  He got a pork and a shrimp, and I got the octopus and a short rib.  I couldn't believe how tender the octopus was and the beef melted in my mouth.  The side dishes are even tastier than your typical rice and beans.  We will definitely be back, maybe happy hour next time!"}
{"text":"Food was bland /chips look like they were store brought chips...rice was over seasoned /soft tacos were soggy made tortilla break apart"}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I went to Urban Taco because it's in our neighborhood to enjoy some Sangria on a Tuesday evening.  Our best part of the experience was the Sangria although it should have been self-serve because the service was LOUSY.  

It was pretty crowded although there were two seats at the bar, so we helped ourselves to the two seats at the bar only to find ourselves waiting to get served as several waiters, waitresses, saw us, and then wait for it including the owner who just ignored us and pretended like we didn't exist.  Let's just say the service is something to be desired and....the owner is a JERK with a capital \"J\" in that he was rude and didn't serve us even after looking straight at us.  I would say with service like that, people won't be back.  

Irritated in my own hood!"}
{"text":"Wow! Greeted by the owner upon arrival and told they'd clear off a table immediately. Then a server came and said the same. We told her they're taking care of us and then ANOTHER person (presumably the other owner, wife of the first guy) asked us if we'd been helped. Food was OUTSTANDING. Salsa flights were so fun and the server was very knowledgeable of the food. Not so much beer knowledge but it was fun to watch her try! Super attentive and friendly. Ambiance feels local. As it should. Skinny margarita was awesome and the lemon was a nice touch. I live just behind the joint and can't wait to come back! Cheers and 5 stars to Urban Taco!"}
{"text":"Hip, delicious and in the perfect neighborhood for hitting more fantastic venues. Flight of salsas? Si, Por favor! Smooth wines and craft beers help compliment that super affordable and tasty street style, nouveau tacos."}
{"text":"Ok let me start by saying I LOOOOOOVE Mexican food! And normally if I'm down at 16th street and Bethany Home it would be to go to Richardsons. But I found a new gem! Urban Taco has an amazing ambiance! Margaritas to die for!!! And the food... Best Mexican in Arizona! The owner is so personable! And I love when owners walk around to chat with customers! This place has taken over my #1 place. Sorry Richardsons. You have been outdone! And thank you Urban Taco! For keeping everything amazing!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with another couple.  Had a great time, the food is delicious and very filling. I had the Short rib burrito which was very fresh and flavorful.  Was a nice size portion with plenty of filling. I could only eat 2 thirds of it, my husband ate the rest.  I may try it as the bowl next time. The other people I was with had the Urban Tacos, again very tasty.  Their Black Beans are excellent.  The Salsas were yummy, my favourite was the Hatch.  Also the Queso dip was really good.  The chips very light fresh and tasty,  not sure why some reviews stated that the chips taste like store chips.  Definitely not the case. I do think the bottle beer a little too pricey even at happy hour prices.  The house Margaritas very good, not too sweet, and you can taste the tequila, which is a thumbs up for me and a great price at $5.  Love the décor of the place, small, rustic and quaint. Great atmosphere.   This place is Gourmet Mexican food and not your typical basic Mexican restaurant.  I love that everything tastes so fresh and hand made.  The dishes are bursting with flavor and that it's a limited and simple menu and great prices.  Definitely will be going back for more."}
{"text":"Anyone who says the food here is good certainly has no tastebuds. First and foremost, it seems that all of the ingredients were bought on the sales rack at Smart and Final. The chips were stale, like they were the last bag *on* said rack. The guacamole was 90% anemic tomatoes and 10% avocado... no other ingredients. The server suggested salsas, one of them they brought out was an aioli, who the heck wants to eat mayonnaise based sauces on chips?! (I'm even one of those weirdos who likes mayonnaise on fries, and that made my stomach turn) 

My \"gourmet\" tacos were both terrible. The \"pork belly\" was basically rubber chunks of fat and the potato I was promised was missing? (Where did you go potato?) The short rib was lukewarm, the tortillas were very sad. We got the bottom of the rice pot, everything was crunchy and tasted chemically. The beans were weird too, and drowned in those aforementioned anemic tomatoes. Everything really just lacked flavor and imagination, the ingredients and seasoning were the problem. Their quality was so low, bargain basement status. 

Oh also, the service was... weird? We walked in and it was full and the man who approached us asked if we could come back later and seemed taken aback when I told him \"no?\" That should've been our sign. 

If you want tasty tacos try Tacos Atoyac for good cheap tacos. If you want very tasty fancier tacos try La Piñata down the street."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Friendly staff, great music, delicious and unique salsas. I had an octopus taco and my mother had the veggie taco. Both were outstanding."}
{"text":"Friendly service, tasty tacos, salsa to die for! So so so good! We need to come back to taste some of the other salsas and tacos on the menu.

Dad had a fish taco that he raved about for the entire meal. We loved the chimichurri salsa. And the pomegranate margarita was solid and STRONG!

This would be my go to for happy hour any day!"}
{"text":"I had three creatively good tacos: shrimp, octopus, and vegetable.  This restaurant is about as urban as a cul-de-sac so I'd rebadge this place 'Suburban Taco' and still return for this taco trio."}
{"text":"Good happy hour! Delicious street tacos: costilla, octopus, pollo as a do, and braised pork,  all $1 off during HH. Also your choice of 5 of 10 tacos plus chips for 4.75 @ HH. $5 house margs and house wines @ HH. And, HH goes until 7. Well done. We'll be back for a full dinner."}
{"text":"This was a tasty spot to grab lunch. We got the street tacos and the 5-salsa sampler. 

Be warned, if you're a wuss like me, everything is spicy. The salsas very good, but you have to be able to take some heat. 

As for the street tacos, they were quite good. Between the chicken, squid, and the beef, the beef was definitely the most flavorful. Adding various salsas to it was fun.

We came by at around 1pm and there were 6 tables and 1 waitress. We felt really bad for her, because she was apologizing each time she came over. Needless to say, the lunch took about an hour and a half as a result...

Prices are on the higher side...keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Just EH. Everything is average. Nothing spectacular. Chips weren't fresh, tasted like they came out of a bag. All the \"salsas\" are cream based, I asked for a fresh tomato salsa and the waitress looked at me like I was crazy. 

So many better places, try any food truck in Phoenix.  Wouldn't call it \"Mexican\" at all."}
{"text":"Ok, I am closer to needing a hip replaced thanbeing a hippster but I love these taco places in Phoenix.

Street tacos, fresh guacamole, mexican sweet corn.

So when I saw Urban Taco had octopus tacos there was no other place to go tonight.

Ok, octopus was interesting, but the short rib taco was da-bomb (told ya I was not a hippster).

Outside dinning would be nice but would never keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"We go out on a regular basis to many taco stops. We were excited to try this one as we had driven past this location many times and always mentioned stopping. 

We all ordered a array tacos to try from pork, chicken and even Octopus. I'm not trying blast anyone, but each taco literally tasted the same as previous one on the meats and the Octopus had it's own flair. We inquired as to if the tacos were all Gluten Free and our server just blurted out  \"Yes they are.\" without checking with the kitchen.\" Kind of like it was a bother to check.\" P.S. - There was flour or wheat in something. Cross-Contamination as she was sick for two days after we dined here. Celiac is a serious thing.

I was looking around for sauce because the tacos are a little dry without something on them. You can get sauce but you have to pay for it? Really? Are things that tight in the taco business? You can get chips too. However, unlike most Mexican restaurants in town that give you complimentary chips, here you pay. It makes sense now! I'm catching the theme.

Our service was substandard at best. Read my reviews, I never complain. However, they may have checked back one other time only because we were flagging them down for sauce and more tacos. I know it is hard to facilitate when there are 6 people seated in the whole place and three of them were us. 

The best part was that our second round of tacos came and the server plopped the new plate right on top of my buddy's old plate. WTH! He never even attempted to clear it and with it he said \"Here you go.\" We all just stared at each other wondering if that just really happened. Anyway, there are too many really great tacos places out there that care a smidgen more than this operator. We may give it a second chance at some point. Training is key for sure. However, I will say that our crew enjoyed the margaritas...

{"text":"My husband and I spent 24 hours in Phoenix recently, and stumbled into this place after unsuccessfully finding a different restaurant we'd been circling the block looking for.  \"Let's just find something quick like tacos!\" we said, and swerved into the parking lot as soon as we saw the unassuming \"Urban Taco\" sign.  We were pleasantly surprised with the warm, modern decor (well decorated but not too pretentious), the interesting menu choices, and the delicious food.  We each got tacos (veggie, shrimp, carnitas, beef) and they were all good.  We had told the waitress we were in a hurry, and the food came out quickly. We tried a local Shake chocolate stout, which was delicious, and the bartender came over to chat with us about it.  We both agreed that if an Urban Taco opened in San Francisco, we'd eat here all the time!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited urban taco today and it was disappointing. I gave it 3 start for their margaritas; which were the best thing they have. I got the prickly pear and the pomegranate margarita, both were really good. Now, to the bad part... our glass of water had a piece of plastic in it. We told our server, she apologized and said it was from the sweet& sour mix bottle she used in the morning ? Not sure how this ended in our water. The guacamole's was average and needed salt. My boyfriend got the pork belly tacos which were nothing but fat, almost no actual meat . He only ate half of one and left the rest since it was just unappealing. I got a octopus taco and costilla , they were okay nothing special. Even though the margaritas were good, I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Not sure what the fuss is about regarding the service - our server was great and the tacos were awesome! Street tacos - all of them - are a must!"}
{"text":"Very delicious!!! Enjoyed Santa Ema pinot, Chilean...was so smooth! Had NY strip taco, ans was melt in your mouth tender. The battered fish taco, had a delicious sauce and it was just super tasty. Then I had a blackened fish taco, it was really scrumptious with a fabulous tasty hollandaise sauce. My waiter Dustin was very friendly, efficient and polite with a charming personality. I feel lucky to stop in this pleasant neighborhood gem tonite."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the very laid back chilled environment that Urban Taco has. Great ambiance in the place. Was greeted at the door right away and told we can sit anywhere. I had the chopped chicken salad with cilantro dressing. Also had the Queso Fundido to start with. Both items were tasty and fresh. I thought the customer service was decent. Cup was empty for a while before anyone noticed and server didn't check on us as much as I would have liked. Other than that this place is a must try."}
{"text":"I was not a fan, salsa's taste like they are made with powdered ingredients. Taco's were not great, I would not go back."}
{"text":"This is a good solid addition to the 16th street corridor, though it enjoys a less than fortunate location in the strip mall where the infamously ghetto-fabulous 16th street sports bar used to be. 

it has a fun cheerful atmosphere and the bar is a great place to park, have a few drinks and some food. Their Happy Hour goes 'til 7 which is awesome and you can enjoy $5 beers and $1 off chips and salsa. I started out with chips and guac which did not disappoint-fresh and delicious.

I took the two taco plate which consisted of a short rib taco, and octopus taco and a side of rice and beans. The tacos were flavorful and good sized. The short rib was good but I expected a little more from the octopus taco-perhaps more meat or less marinating and other ingredients because I really couldn't taste it. It was not bad, don't get me wrong but I love octopus and was REALLY looking forward to this and it didn't quite deliver.

Their salsas are great. The chipotle salsa is really good but the kick sneaks up on you. My taste buds were toasty even when I was driving home.This was only my first visit so I'm eager to come back and try more tacos.

They have a small but solid selection of wine, your requisite Corona and Dos Equis and some tasty looking hand-crafted cocktails.The service is friendly and the crowd that was in were all lively and fun. My underwhelming octopus taco not withstanding, I still recommend stopping in and giving them a try."}
{"text":"Salsas were great.  Tacos were average.  Service was meh.  Local joint, didn't try the drinks but would probably be a good place to try a margarita or moonshine cocktail."}
{"text":"This little taco place is legit! Last night my hubby and I got the keys to our new house in Madison Manor, and were thrilled to see Urban Taco had opened right at the end of our street. I had high hopes for this place because who doesn't want access to awesome Mexican food just a block away from home?
Well folks, I am pleased to report it was incredibly delicious! We started with a tasting flight of 5 salsas, and that honestly could've been my whole meal right there. Chips and salsa are where my judgment of a Mexican restaurant lies, and all of the ones we sampled were great. The variety of flavors they've created are sure to please most everyone's palate.
For the meal I tried the costilla short rib taco and the Baja shrimp taco, which were delightful. Hubs had both of their pork offerings and they were thoroughly enjoyed as well.
They have a nice little bar with a selection of wine and beer that includes a few craft brews (which hopefully they will expand more as the business grows). There's also a selection of specialty mixed drinks for those of you looking for an extra kick in the pants.
During our dinner last night, the owner himself welcomed us to the neighborhood, so come on out CenPho and welcome him too!"}
{"text":"We took a group of 7 last night. Food and service were excellent. Burritos and tacos were all very good.  Will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"as always, Lisa and her crew work their fannies off and make their diners smile with a wonderful menu, ambience, and service!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing... but tonight's experience not so much. 1st the server brought me the wrong tacos so I had to wait while my partner ate (told him to do it so it wouldn't get cold) then server forgot our rice/beans. Finally he brought them out. That was the last time we heard from him. He never checked up on us! We both wanted to order more, including more wine but he never came back (btw the restaurant is only half full so being busy isn't the right excuse) now we just sit waiting and waiting for him to cash us out... here's a hint DONT FOGET THE SMALL TABLES... we tip too (service makes all the difference)"}
{"text":"Food is sub par at best.  Blech!!"}
{"text":"Talk about a diamond in the rough! Yelp always comes through for my food cravings when I'm in a new part of town. I was getting new tires on my car, so my husband and I headed over to Urban taco to kill some time and fill our bellies. 

It's located on the corner of this small strip mall and looks pretty rough on the outside. Once you walk in though, you can tell it's newly modeled with a cute rustic modern feel. Casual atmosphere, fast service, and friendly servers. They had a great lunch special running from from 11AM- 2PM that included 3 street tacos with rice and beans for $7.95. 

I think the unique stand out item here is their assortment of homemade salsa's!! They are delicious and packed with flavor. We started with the chips and salsa flight. $1 off coupon with check-in. Thanks yelp! (: 

We tried multiple salsa's but my favorites were:
1. roasted tomato & poblano- perfect amount of sweetness and spice
2. roasted corn & garlic crema- creamy and tasty
3. roasted hatch chili- My FAV!! so flavorful

For the 3 street taco lunch special I got the pollo asada, short rib, and pork. They were all very good. Perfect size and good flavor especially when you added all the different salsas. My favorite was the pork, it was so juicy. The side of rice was boring though and needed salsa added to it. I could of gone without it. I was sad they didn't have a carne asada street taco though :(

Overall everything was fantastic and we left super satisfied. You know it was a successful visit when your walking back to your vehicle talking about how good everything was and when you want to come back. I did see they have a great everyday happy hour and taco special on Tuesday and Thursday. 

Thank you Urban Taco and thank you yelp for introducing us. I will definitely be back for a second date based on the first impression. Hehe do you believe in love at first salsa... I do! (:"}
{"text":"This has to be a hidden treasure!! We stopped in here just by chance and was taken by surprise. The inside area is very quaint and comforting, yet there is a bar to sit at if that's what you're looking for. The food is amazing!! We did there happy hour taco deal - can I just say 1.50$ taco happy hour, yes please?! You have to try all of their sauces with their chip and salsa appetizer (I believe there was six flavors, all very different and all very spectacular in every way)! If you're considering this place you might as well just give in and go cause it's amazing."}
{"text":"For street tacos there was plenty of filling. I tried the Costilla, Pollo Asada and Braised Pork nothing wow and a little too salty for me. I didn't care for the Margarita. Place is clean serve was good just not for me."}
{"text":"I was amazed by how delicious and fresh my burrito was! Like the fact the location is hidden and quaint! I will definitely be returning soon !"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm naive given the lack of great tex-mex where I'm from (NY), but I absolutely loved this place. Fantastic salsas (their specialty) and I had the chicken burrito. One of the best I've ever had. I'm sad I won't be back down this way anytime soon."}
{"text":"Zero stars.  ZERO.  The whole draw of this place is that each taco comes with a delicious salsa.  It has been this way since they opened.  Since their tacos and drinks are terrible, this is the only reason to come here.  No more.  One salsa per table.  Irrelevant how many tacos you order.  Also irrelevant, apparently, that the menu says a salsa comes with each a la carte order.  Also, they messed up my tacos. Boooooooo"}
{"text":"I was really pleasantly surprised by this place. Small restaurant but it was consistently busy so we decided to try.  Smaller menu but our tacos were very good!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a meal after work today. We wanted a little meal without a full on restaurant. This was the perfect place! We tried several kinds of tacos and ordered the 5 salsa flight. It was really hard to decide which was our favorite! 
This is a really neat spot to chill, eat, and grab a drink! To top it off the service was excellent. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here tonight for Taco Tuesday. The outside of the restaurant is rather unassuming, but it's actually pretty nice inside. We started with some margaritas and chips with a salsa flight. The salsas were all good - my favorite was a green one - Chimichurri I think? It was amazing. I got three of the street tacos which were only $1.50 for happy hour! A pork, a beef, and an octopus - all great! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good food, great salsas, great service. Pretty room, and friendly & attentive service. We were there for dinner (bonus -- happy hour runs through 7:00). Started off with chips and a variety of salsas. Loved the chipotle, as well as the avocado. Street tacos were $1.50 each so I tried all 4. Short rib, pork and chicken tacos were all very good. Octopus was only so-so; would have preferred more grill/char flavor. Decent craft beer options, although no drafts and high priced ($5?) for \"happy hour\". Nice place, we'll be back."}
{"text":"I don't often review but this is how bad the service was here. Don't ignore those other reviews on the terrible service, it's a consistent story. 

Short story, worst service I have ever experienced. All the bad service came from one waitress, Cindy, who was not welcoming, had an attitude, was condescending and was overall made us feel unwanted at the restaurant. 

Came in just after 8 knowing, and knowing they closed at 9 I asked the owner if this was ok for a table for 4. The owner replied kindly that it was fine, but our waitress Cindy was apparently determined to make us feel not welcomed for the remainder of our time. She started by telling us that \"just so you know, we close at 9\", would have been ok without her attitude. She rolled her eyes after we asked our third question about the menu, and was condescending when we asked about something we missed on the menu. 

Later she expressed in disgust that she was going to have to split a bill for 4 people, something I would expect any descent restaurant to do. 

Last time I ever visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"First experience was great! My girlfriend and I decided to try it tonight and I'm so glad we did. It happened to be Taco Tuesday and street tacos were on special. I tried 4 different tacos...the pork belly and potato was my favorite, but none of the others disappointed. The black beans and Spanish rice were excellent. Not heavily seasoned or covered up with salsa...authentic black beans and REAL Mexican rice like my mother and grandmother made. I had the prickly pear margarita and it was also excellent. The only negative thing I have to say is that they put too much meat on the tacos....ha, not a negative in my book! I'll be back for sure...many, many times! The staff was very friendly and the owner took our order and his wife made our first margarita.  Excellent all the way around! If you don't go, you're missing out."}
{"text":"This place was great! Decor was clean and crisp, the food was excellent and well priced. The chopped chicken salad was excellent with a large amount of moist rotisserie chicken! Why can't all salads with chicken be this way? The sauces were very good--chimichuri sauce was the fave. Would go back again!"}
{"text":"Just went to this inviting little restaurant for the first time and felt compelled to write a glowing review. I had two of their gourmet tacos: shrimp with portabello mushrooms and chiccarones, and I can honestly say that these were the best tacos I've ever eaten: everything was so fresh and seasoned so well, and the portions were generous. My friend and I also shared 1/2 order of guac and chips - plenty for two, and also very flavorful and well-seasoned. I'll tell all of my friends and can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you the story of this weekend.  It all started when I craved cheap street tacos again and headed over to Los Taquitos first (my go-to spot).  Their credit card machine was broken so I headed over here via Yelp to get my street taco fix.

I come in and the place is rustic cute!  The girl at the counter was mediocre friendly and the restaurant was not that busy.  I order street tacos and their popular three flight salsa with chips to-go.  Once I got my check, my jaw dropped!  I was charged more than double I would pay at Los Taquitos (which is down the street).

I get to my destination and my mouth is salivating because I am so hungry.  I take one bite and I was NOT happy!  The tacos were dry, had no flavor, and meh - AND I PAID more than what I think they are worth.

Sorry Yelp, you lead me astray this time."}
{"text":"Pros 
- nice ambiance 
- delicious tacos, we all liked the chicken ones the most. 
- good salsa

Con
- only 1 waitress"}
{"text":"Day drinking and a craving for street tacos brought us in here late on a Saturday night. We immediately felt guilty as there was only one other group in the place and they were seated at the bar. The owner came quickly and told us to sit anywhere and tried to entice us with drinks. As we were already fairly drunk we didn't try any on our first visit but quickly dug into the menu. 

Their gourmet tacos sparked my interest and their burritos were calling my boyfriend's name. In the end I asked to add an extra taco to their gourmet plate (which only includes two tacos, rice, and black beans). The owner warned me that it would be quite a bit of food since their gourmet tacos are much larger but I still went ahead and got the Costilla, New York Strip, and Braised Pork and my boyfriend got the Costilla burrito along with the habanaro salsa and the green chili and cilantro aioli.

Food was quick and they definitely weren't lying about the size of the tacos! Each one was overflowing with tasty toppings and so juicy that I used the next taco to collect any of the escaping deliciousness. In the end I ate half of each (as we were planning on splitting the tacos and the burrito) but I couldn't even look at the burrito by that point. Everything tasted incredible and the sauces pared wonderfully with each dish. The left over burrito was even still so good it almost brought a tear to my eye.

We came back two days later during happy hour since we couldn't get those delicious tastes out of our memory, this time we tried their regular street tacos and a braised beef burrito along with a strawberry margarita. The drink was overly sweet with too much syrup but at least it was half off for happy hour. 

The street tacos were definitely lacking compared to the gourmet tacos, and the one that was supposed to be the delicious costilla ended up being polo instead. The burrito was good but still just not quite as good as the costilla and the chicken taco just wasn't up my ally. Everything was still very tasty but the delicious juiciness was lacking. 

In the end I would suggest this place to anyone who loves a tasty taco and doesnt mind spending a bit extra to do it up right. The atmosphere is casual but intimate, great for large groups or take out, and their happy hour deals change daily (and Tuesdays they donate some of their earnings to Madison School district). We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Definitely delicious tacos!!... Even for a Monday. The Gourmet Tacos are the way to go for a flavorful experience!
The margaritas were a little skimpy, but did make mine to order (jalapeño ginger with chile sugar salt).
The wait staff was serviceable, but she was the only one working the floor. 
The trio of salsas were enough of a fill for an appetizer, but they might consider a house salsa as standard. 
Overall... A solid four stars!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Unique, but still approachable. We got their salsa trio, nachos, taco plate, and green chili burrito. The portions were pretty big and we ordered too much but I was still excited to have leftovers. I'm a huge nachos critic and theirs were top notch-o. The decor is cozy and intimate with low lights and warm ambiance. There are fresh flowers on every table and a wood bar that offers tasty cocktails, beer, and a nice wine selection as well. We have been here twice now and will keep going back!"}
{"text":"Definitely NOT a good place for vegetarians. Very meat-oriented menu; rice is cooked in pork stock, but the black beans are not. Salsas in their \"salsa flight\" are almost all puréed except the cucumber pico which just seemed like cut up cucumber and not a lot else. Guacamole was too lemony and wasn't freshly made.

I ordered a shrimp burrito without cheese. Presentation was nice but there was only pork-rice, shrimp, cheese inside. It was disappointing. Not only was it made wrong with cheese, but it was boring...flavorless and dry. I'd recommend this place if you're a gringo who likes flavorless food but not to anyone who actually likes flavorful or spicy dishes."}
{"text":"I used to highly recommend this place because the food was good and different. Lately I have received poor service and even poorer quality food. I placed an pursed with the bar server and watched her write down my entire order. 
After 15 minutes of waiting for a burrito it comes out covered in items that I specified I did not want. 
They take it back and then the owner and her bring the food back out 10 minutes later. I asked for salsa and he tells me it has salsa already. I said \"yes I am aware I would like some hot sauce. I come here all the time.\"

He pulls out a menu so I can choose the only hot salsa they have. I then finally get to eat my burrito and it's COLD. COMPLETELY COLD. 10 minutes of recooking a burrito and it's COLD. 

WHAT WERE THEY DOING?

The owner lied to me about the order and the waitresses understanding of it and then said he \"wont make me pay for it\" after I informed him how cold it was and that my lunch break was entirely eaten up. I ended up walking out, no need to listen to his excuses on why his food was cold. 

I WENT OUT FRONT AND THEIR WAS A PICKUP TRUCK WITH RAW MEAT IN THE BED. ARE THEY USING THAT MEAT? IS THAT YOUR SOURCE? 

Won't be going back. Hope nobody else does either. COLD FOOD HEALTH RISK."}
{"text":"Great place,  superb food. Tried the green chili pork burrito  (4 times so far) & each time it was fantastic.   Great place to take friends or a date."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book, or Urban Taco, by its cover. It's SO cute inside. I'd steal everything but the Christmas lights in a second. Adorbs. The owners are obviously present and involved & the service was attentive but not overbearing- loved it. Moving on. The food is good but not great. The 4 street tacos all had the same toppings but different proteins. Boring. The rice was horrible... could have easily been six days old and left on the counter. The salsas weren't much better- the chimichurri tasted exactly like creamy pesto, another tasted like pasta or vodka sauce and the garlic one was reminiscent of thick garlic aioli. But wait!! The corn side dish with poblanos and onions was the stuff my dreams are made of, the refried beans & veggie taco my friend had looked super good... so I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"If you are a someone that orders the same thing every time you go to a restaurant because you hate to get something that you don't like and feel like you wasted your money. This is not the place for you. I ordered the pork burrito that my waitress suggested and I didn't like it at all. It had a weird flavor. This was definitely not the restaurant for me. I liked the chips and avocado dip. I have a more boring palate. My kids got fish tacos and didn't like them.  My husband got shrimp tacos and liked it fine. It was a waste of a lot of money for me."}
{"text":"Passed by this place several times over the past few years and I finally decided to stop in.  It's a small place only about 7-8 tables and bar seating.  Very modern décor and seating though.  Fairly simple menu (Tacos & Burritos), but kicked up with funky & fun items.  They have \"street tacos\" and the regular tacos are made with regular white corn tortilla's.  I order the 2 taco (a Blackened Catfish & an Octopus) combo that comes with black refried beans and rice, and I added on 1 additional taco (pork belly), because I wanted to try a few different tacos.  Everything was cooked well and dressed with queso fresco and various types of pico de gallo.  I was particularly impressed by the catfish & the octopus tacos.  The service was good considering there was only one waitress, but she was very quick and attentive.  I will definitely go back to try other items."}
{"text":"The pork belly is good, but the tacos are rather inconsistent - the first time was good, second time was meh, and the last time the tortillas were really tough and hard to chew.

The service leaves something to be desired - they are always in a huge rush, even when the place is not full. My wife found a bristle from a basting/pastry brush in her food and the owner just told us what it was without apologizing or anything."}
{"text":"Amazaing service!  New to the neighborhood so decided to check it out. I ordered the fish tacos and they were delicious. Tacos were a decent size too. Our server was super friendly and gave great service. If you are in the area definitely check it out."}
{"text":"I hope I am not the only one who thought their spicy habanero hot sauce was the best I've ever had? I had to get some to go because I want to eat it with every meal! the tacos were great, my margarita was great and my server was great! I popped in here right before close to grab some tacos and I am so happy I did!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see Urban Taco move into the Central Corridor area. However, not to impressed. The chips were not authentic, I believe they were Tostitos. I tried 3 salsas, the cucumber salsa good concept but  lacked in reasoning and needed a crunch factor or spice. Tried 3 street tacos and all lacked in seasoning. I will say they are definitely better than Americas Tacos. Being Hispanic, please make your own tortilla  chips and SEASON your food, it will make a difference."}
{"text":"Ordered the gourmet tacos: Shrimp and Pork. Excellent! Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We're currently in the midst of an ongoing quest to find the \"perfect\" taco in Phoenix. We haven't quite found it yet, but it has resulted in us trying a wide variety of new places.

Oddly located in a little strip, we inadvertently showed up while Urban Taco was doing \"Taco Thursday.\" All street tacos were $1.50. At least this place doesn't mess around. This whole trend of charging customers upwards of four dollars per taco by littering the words \"local\" all over the menu needs to stop and stop right now!

We started with chips and a flight of five salsas. These include roasted corn, avocado, green chilie, chimichurri, and cucumber. Actually, I take that back. We had intended to start with the chips, but the server completely forgot to bring them out. I was wondering why it was taking so long. When she finally came, she had our tacos, but no chips. I had to politely ask what had happened to them. Unfortunately, we were forced to eat them with the tacos, despite wanting them first. Eh, mistakes are made, I guess.

Salsas were kind of a hit and miss. I absolutely loved the chimichurri and green chilie. I would have absolutely no idea what the roasted corn was if you served it to me blind. The others just simply weren't my style. It was a fun little sampling experience if anything else.

For tacos, we both ordered an identical three (costilla, pollo asado, and braised pork). Where is my traditional carne asada? I tried to convince my girlfriend to try the octopus, but she downright refused. Quite frankly, I don't blame her.

We both agreed that the pollo was a bit dry, but the costilla (short ribs) and braised pork were both decent in flavor and quality. I do wish they had a few more options on the street taco end, but with the prices at only $1.50 on special, you really can't complain. The beans were excellent, while the rice was just standard stuff. There are no dessert offerings, unfortunately.

I'm sticking with a solid three stars for the time being. We might return at some point, presumably receiving our food in proper order and I'll update my review accordingly if things change.

Recommended for some fairly decent tacos at a cheap price."}
{"text":"Loved this lil neighborhood gem. Tasty street tacos for 1.50 during happy hour. Restaurant is clean and modern. Staff is nice. Great variety of salsa"}
{"text":"First visit was awesome!  Chips and three types of salsa and all three were delicious. Had the pollo asado tacos which were moist and tender.  The owner came out to check on the meal which is always nice I think to have a connection with a local restaurant owner.  The ambiance was very casual and the music was great too.  Definitely returning with more friends!!"}
{"text":"Best nachos in town. Hands down. 
First visit we tried all of the tacos. All of them. Too many. Next visit we simplified, opted for the classics. A dozen trips later we noticed the nachos. Life changing. Seriously. At the bottom of the plate there's still stuff like chicken and queso and crispy chips. More than a meal for two. And so delicious. Also, the margaritas are pretty good. Highly recommend the nachos though. I can't post a picture because they're gone."}
{"text":"Had a Pork Verde burrito on a Sat night here. Loved it! It was soo good. I got the sauce on the side because I dont like a lot of sauce over my burritos. I think it was one of the best I've had in phoenix. Service was good too and fast. 
Small little cozy place nice and clean. 
I'm going here again for sure!!
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Positives: cute place, salsa flight, short rib taco 

I really wanted to like this place. However, the food was generally not good. The guacamole was rotten. The steak and shrimp tacos were not good. The beans and rice lacked flavor. The worst part was the water; our waters smelled like fish!"}
{"text":"Street taco  lunch special!!!! Tasty marinated meats with taco fixings and rice and beans for 7.95. What a deal. I had very little time for lunch, was in and out in 30 mins. I would highly recommend this spot. Fast, Clean, friendly and delicious = lunch time jackpot!!!"}
{"text":"Overall pretty good tacos and salsas are definitely yummy. Unfortunately not impressed with the regular street tacos. You can get those cheaper and more flavorful from the actual Mexican tacos shops. But the gourmet ones were pretty yummy. Salsa Flight was a great addition. We got 5 of them. Unfortunately can't remember which ones we liked but it's good to experiment.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Taco Tuesday for $1.50 tacos and glad we stopped. We had a male server who was very attentive and helpful, reviewed the menu with us since it was our first time visiting. We started with trying 3 different salsa, we like hot and spicy and unfortunately none of them had the spice that we were looking for even they were the spiciest ones they offered. We asked for tabasco sauce or hot sauce for the tacos when they arrived, but unfortunately they don't keep any other sauces in the restaurant since they want customers to try their sauces--if you do this to the customers then at least create some spicer sauces. Tried all four beef, pork, chicken, and octopus tacos. I eat octopus often and the octopus here was not cooked properly and did not taste right at all. The pork/beef/pork tasted great and was moist. Also, was able to enjoy 2 margaritas -- not too sweet and good amount alcohol. Would return if in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to return and I would bring my own hot sauce."}
{"text":"Great place with awesome food, friendly staff cozy atmosphere and did I mention the food! I'm definitely coming back with friends or even a date."}
{"text":"The scuttlebutt around the 'hood was that this place is a great new addition, so I thought I'd try it out for taco Tuesday. 
The deal is this: $1.75 street tacos & $1 off a salsa flight & drinks. The kicker is that the drinks are expensive to start with. A Corona for $5.75 ref price & $5 oh happy hour - in this town! You've got to be joking! The margarita was bland & sour, I couldn't drink it. My exchange was handled with grace by the bartender, so kudos there. 
I got a round of their tacos, four. 
Pollo asado: very dry meat, all white though if that appeals & bland. 
Short ribs: not bad, also a bit dry. 
Braised pork: finally a tender meat! Subtle but nice seasoning. 
Octopus: the winner, well seasoned & tender , with the natural flavor coming through :) something that is actually quite difficult to obtain. 

The skinny: Bland overpriced food & drink attempting to play to the CenPho crowd & thinks it's achieving through decor. Clearly a gringo trap."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday for lunch. One of the best taco joints we've been to. The salsa selection is great as well. My moonshine margarita set me right.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"$1.50 street tacos for happy hour. The pork taco is phenomenal! Try the chipotle salsa and chimichurri salsa. Hand crafted with care. Beyond amazing. Cindi (and all the servers) are an absolute delight. Always warm, friendly and accommodating!"}
{"text":"Cindy, was terrible.  We sat down at 8:15, they close at 9:00pm.  We left at 9:03pm.  She was a beeeeeeee hole the whole time.  Food was actually tasty, but she made it salty...as well as the experience.  We asked the owner as we walked in if it was okay to eat he said it was cool.  First and last experience here...Cindy also made it clear that it was extremely inconvenient to split a tab 4 ways."}
{"text":"Overall a small strip mall restaurant with a few tables.  Came for Taco Tuesday happy hour at 3:30pm (the HH starts at 3pm) - it was very uncrowded. $1.50 street tacos (short rib, octopus and pulled pork) were great. The octopus was my least favorite, and wound up ordering another short rib taco - but overall the tacos were very good. The $5 wine was good too. Came away for under $12, which is pretty darn cheap for the quality of food I got. I recommend this place especially for happy hour."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference, as usual I always eat Mexican Food. This place is close by and it is good!! Small cheap tacos and many selections as well as the salsas!!!!"}
{"text":"It's just ok. Cool space. Chicken and steak gourmet tacos were good. Short rib meat was disappointing. No kids menu - $8 for a cheese quesadilla.  Guacamole was good and the chips were good. Surprised chips and salsa were not complimentary. (Worlds best salsa at El Pinto in Albuquerque is free). Margarita was average. Our server, a younger guy, was slow to clear table and slow with the check.  Manager or owner asked how meal was and I said OK.  He did not follow up on why just OK.  That surprised me."}
{"text":"Super cute place and food is Amazing!!!! love the decor and relaxed environment. I came here during a work lunch so unfortunately was unable to try a delicious beer on menu, but hte pork tacos were delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour the other day to try the latest edition to the street taco crazy taking over Phoenix.

The place is small but well decorated and cozy and I loved the lighting at the bar. 

We split the street tacos which were only $1.50 during happy hour! What really set them a part were all the sala choices. I picked 6, my favorites were the roasted corn, chipotle and avacado crema. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of them on the menu. The coronas were still around 5 bucks on happy hour which was pretty high, but they did have house margaritas and wines for $5.

I will be back"}
{"text":"Really delicious food and some amazing salsas nice low key vibe and friendly staff"}
{"text":"We had an AMAZING evening and had to give huge thanks to Jonathan for an amazing dining experience. He made dinner and drink recommendations, and he was so spot on that we ordered a surprise round of drinks for our second round. Every taco we had was amazing...pork belly taco, blackened fish, New York strip, and short rib... All were incredible. In addition, we ordered the salsa sampler and were extremely happy. 

Relaxing atmosphere, great service, incredible food. I highly recommended Urban Taco to everyone."}
{"text":"The food and experience was amazing thanks to Jonathan! My friend and I drove all the way from San Diego to meet with some friends and was completely impressed by the service and the quality of food! Next time we come back to Phoenix we will definitely be back! Thanks again Jonathan!"}
{"text":"Came here for Taco Tuesday and LOVED it! The interior is modern, I always love brick walls and wood tables. The music choice was on-point. Honestly, sounded like a playlist I have at home so that was a major plus :) The staff is very friendly and educated of the menu. The food was quick! We tried the Salsa flight of 5 different choices and the waitress suggested their best ones (loved all of them). Tried the octopus taco, carne asada, and pollo all three were amazing! Will definitely be returning soon! Perhaps on another Taco Tuesday evening!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Their tacos are super amazing, most modern taco shops aren't very good but this one will never disappoint you! I got to talk to the owner and he seemed very down to earth. But he has some killer tacos coming out of that kitchen. Their salsas are a whole other topic.  I think I've tried every single salsa in the menu. I suggest ordering a salsa flight so you can try some salsas. Overall great place to get a modern taco that actually has more than a spoonful of meat on them!"}
{"text":"While the food is tasty I feel like I'm being ripped off. Blackened fish tacos came with 90% pico de gallo and 10% fish. That is NO exaggeration. Doesn't matter how much I like the salsas I refuse to spend another dime at an establishment that is intentionally ripping people off. 

Wtf Urban Taco?!?!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome and the service was exceptional. Highly recommend.
Thank you Jonathan!!!
Prickly pear margarita was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Service was quick and friendly. Super cute interior. Great lunch special $7.95 for 3 street tacos with rice and black beans. Queso was delicious with a hint of spice. There's also a salsa sampler. I suggest the green chimichurri salsa for the tacos and dipping chips in."}
{"text":"I came in while I had time to spare in between dental appointments. (Shoutout to Dr Serrano and Dr Day) I was hungry and finally had a chance to sneak in some me time so I decided to take myself to lunch. There's a ton of local eateries in this biltmore-ish area so I was determined to check something off my Yelp! Bookmark list. Urban tacos it is! In a seemingly boring strip mall but beautifully designed inside. The door was open and letting in the cool breeze of the day. I was short on time and didn't want to overindulge so I stuck to my budget and schedule and ordered a Corona 2 street tacos and a half order of chips and guacamole. The service was good. She recommended the green chile cilantro salsa which was excellent and the short rib taco, equally as good. 

I love this place and hope I can return soon with the beau."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of the place and come here often. The lighting, music, and decor are all very nice.  Their margaritas are great, which is hard to find. They definitely do not water them down as has been my experience with most other places. They have specials almost every night of the week. The costilla tacos are my favorite, I've tried a few of the salsas and have liked them all. I have always been treated kindly and promptly."}
{"text":"Nothing that made me say I must come back, had taco and salsa flight.  Service was fine, nice set of wines, clean safe. 

So if you need someplace for a first date or catch up meeting this is great...if you are looking to have an gastro adventure this may not be the spot."}
{"text":"So So

I wanted to like this new place as I read about it in the Phoenix Magazine, but was disappointed.   Me and a friend went their for lunch and there was only 2 other tables with customers.  Guess we missed the lunch crowd.  We were seated quickly and brought 2 glasses of water.  The waitress seemed slow, disappearing to go to the back for some time. She did not come back to take our order till 10-15 minutes later.  Mind you she only had 3 tables, one which was already done eating and searching for her so they can pay and leave. The chips tasted stale and not warmed up.  We did enjoy the salsas and corn soup. Other than that nothing else was anything to rave about.  Now maybe the waitress was new, or having an off day.  She was very pleasant and thanked us for coming in.  I hope she gets some help, especially when it is busy.  I probably;y will not return or recommend to anyone else."}
{"text":"Food was very good atmosphere was very  trendy and service was prompt and friendly. Had baha shrimp tacos very tasty even the rice and beans had a nice flavor. Paired that with a glass of sangria. Glad I stopped in.would have given 5 stars if I had gotten chips and salsa. Thought that was a given in a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. If you want to try something new and different come to Urban Taco! Their salsas are as amazing as the tacos. Service was great. If you have Alix or Corynne, you're bound to fall in love. Had a great time! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Saturday night with my husband and 1 year old because it is marked as a kid friendly restaurant. Everyone was super nice and the atmosphere was great. There was enough noise to drown out our kid without making it hard to talk. The creamed corn is unreal! We ordered a second side of it because it was so good! Only bummer was they don't have a soda fountain system so they didn't have club soda. Everything else was stellar!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try Urban Tacos. It must just be me, because the reviews are great. I had the house $5 margarita which was super water down even though the proprietar said that the tequila was poured \"up to here\" referring to 75% of the glass. So I tried the jalapeño and ginger margarita which was undrinkable. Finally I had the Castilla burrito, which was a hot mess and also inedible. Complete miss for me!"}
{"text":"I'll start going here when the owners show a little belief in their business by building an actual bar, not a bunch of high tables pushed together. Seems like this place is bracing itself to fail. Avid restaurant goers pick up on this. Get your act together, with this location, you could totally be a hot spot. Shame."}
{"text":"Service slow , pork belly to fatty , steak taco tasted like Salisbury gravy. Margaritas good, corn shells to chewy and cold. Wait for check very slow, guacamole to much lime ."}
{"text":"Gourmet taco plate:
Baja Shrimp taco
Braised Pork taco
Absolutely delicious 
Salsa flight (5 choices) very good (pico, good; Roasted tomato and poblano, very good; Roasted corn and garlic crema, good; Habanero, great; Chipotle, great)
Service started out a little aloof but warmed up as lunch progressed. 
Interior is nice, but very small. Big tables, bar looks nice. 
This place will be hard to get into once \"the people\" catch wind of it! Let's keep it our secret for now."}
{"text":"Urban taco has an easy, chill vibe about it. The music is relaxed--not loud mariachi or party music. The colors are warm and inviting--not over the top loud colors. The decor is rustic chic and charming, dining area and bar are clean, and there is plenty of parking. I've been to the happy hour several times and really enjoy the tacos. The meat is lean and not fatty. Oh and the shrimp burrito was toasted and very flavorful. Of course you'll pay a couple more bucks for excellent quality Mexican food--this is not your corner greasy taco truck. Urban Taco's food is prepared and plated with care. And it shows. I'll definitely be returning for lunch, happy hour, and/or dinner dates in the future. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and decor are welcoming and unique.Tacos were super greasy, the bottom of my plate had a quarter inch layer of grease when I finished. All I could taste was the grease when I was done. I dont know why I kept eating they weren't even that good. I read the other reviews and was excited to try the tacos. I tried the octopus and didnt finish that one, it was very rubbery and chewy. We had 3 salsa's and chips which we liked or I would have given less stars. Service was OK, not real friendly, or speedy. good thing it was happy hour and it was priced well."}
{"text":"This place recently opened near my house, so we figured we'd try it. Went for happy hour street tacos... $1.50 per seemed like a pretty good deal. Walked inside and really enjoyed the look and feel of the place (this is why I gave it two stars). That's pretty much where our excitement stopped. 

The food took forever even though there were only a handful of patrons. The bill came quick though, which was awesome because we couldn't get out of there fast enough. Tried all four street tacos, and they basically tasted the same. No real difference or flavor, unless you added the provided flavored salsa. The rice and beans were extremely underwhelming as well.

I probably will try this place one more time, as it is literally a block away, but I won't be recommending this place to anyone anytime soon."}
{"text":"I should be out running right now and not writing this review, but with Urban Taco fresh in my mind and belly I thought I would crank it out. Place is near my new fav bar Linger Longer Lounge so that's a plus! Okay, it's a Thursday night and I have been drinking for about two weeks straight so this was a food only mission. My gal and I ordered up some chips and a grouping of salsas. All but one of the salsas were shockingly thick. But don't worry, these salsas will get any mariachi band up and trumpeting. Roasted corn, avocado crema, green chili w/ cilantro, cucumber and roasted tomato/poblano. Usually there will be a salsa that falls flat. Not here, all are loaded with flavor and with the thin chips are a must! Wow, I could really use a pacifico beer. No, stay focused and dry!! Next on the list is two street tacos. Pork belly with potato? What, can you mix that shit? Hell yeah, and to my surprise it was a mashed potato. Unreal. All I can say is unreal. My second choice, the short rib. Moist (hate that word) short rib with some greens and sauce. Delicious! Now the gathering tables will leave you little room for your thighs and the service can be a bit dodgy, but they are very friendly and appreciate the business."}
{"text":"Love this place!! It's my first time here and my girlfriend and I are enjoying a delicious margarita and excellent food! Such a cool atmosphere, and Jonathan has made us feel so welcome. Sure a cute little place hidden amongst the congested 16th St/ Bethany Home bustle. I stumbled upon it after my nearby desired destination was a huge let down. I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"I came in hungry; it was late in the afternoon and I was just looking to eat..anywhere. I almost passed up this little gem in a nondescript strip mall. I'm glad I didn't. The server was friendly, helpful and conversant. He made some recommendations for a quck not too heavy lunch.
The octopus street taco was delicious, sorry I wasn't hungrier, I wanted more.Vegetable taco-best I've had.
Can't wait to come back, I need to try the short rib taco."}
{"text":"Definitely not for kids!  This is all very unique food and tacos. My kids didn't eat one bit of their food because it was so unique. I like the Baja shrimp tacos and thought they were decent but everybody else's food was pretty much wasted. Maybe I just have some really picky eaters.  We went to McDonald's right after Ha."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place as previous reviewers were quite pleased with the food here. It was a very smart choice as both the food and the service were excellent. As happy hour lasts from 4 to 7, most diners will have the opportunity to save a few bucks and enjoy a house margarita or a beer as well as some chips and salsa. The chips come with 3 or 5 different salsas which are all fresh and tasty. The burritos and tacos have great flavor and will definitely appease most hearty appetites. Overall an exceptional dining experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent very fresh dishes had elegant presentations...this is a must.. reasonably priced.Recently spent more money at a fast food Mexican dive.....this place is clean great selection of wines ...cost friendly...I highly recommend."}
{"text":"You can't throw a sombrero in Phoenix without hitting a \"modern Mexican\" restaurant. They're all branded as gourmet, fusion, and sport the same stained concrete and corrugated iron interiors, minimalist decor and overpriced food. It's a formula that works I guess, although lacking in originality.

Urban Taco fits this mold. Sleek, modern interior? Check. \"Gourmet\" tacos on the menu? Check. Stained concrete and corrugated iron? Check.

So what sets Urban Taco apart? Why should you come to yet another Modern Mexican place?

THE FOOD. Urban Taco may not be an original concept, but of the myriad Modern Mex places I've been, Urban delivers on the Taco.

Let's start with the salsa. My advice: try them all. Each has its own unique nuance, and they are really what make the tacos here pop. Don't skimp on the salsa.

The food is extremely rich. Listen to these dishes: pork belly and potato, roasted corn and garlic cream, avocado and garlic crema. Extremely heavy and creamy, and every bite is a joy. The Rajas Con Crema De Maize impressed me the most. In keeping with the rest of the menu, it was thick, creamy and rich.

Urban Taco is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Urban Taco for the first time last night. When we first got there, all the seating was taken except a small table by the door and it became obvious there was only one waitress/server. We almost walked out thinking  service would be lousy. I'm glad we didn't. Our waitress was with us in just a few minutes and took our orders. The food came out very quickly and we were delighted with the service. The food was absolutely delightful, and we really enjoyed the selection of salsas. I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for something new and unique. And we learned later, that a member of the waitstaff and walk out earlier that day."}
{"text":"I went to Urban Taco awhile back. I was immediately blown away by the interior and the decor. I was comfortable before I even say down. Then I got the food and will forever be a fan of Urban Taco. Great spot for dates too."}
{"text":"Had eaten here several times before but today's lunchtime experience was terrible. Waited 20 minutes to be seated, waited over an hour for drinks, and were never given utensils and napkins (even after our food had arrived). We actually had to scavenge them from unoccupied tables. They brought only 3 of the 4 orders; the waitress said the chef had lost one order. We asked for extra salsa and it never came. To top it all off, the fish tacos had so much breading on the fish (fried) that it was almost I recognizable as fish. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"Just had my first Urban Taco experience today and I can't rave enough about the place!  The Costilla tacos are amazing!!  Happy hour is also well worth checking out!  Great Uptown neighborhood joint!"}
{"text":"Just checked this place out the other day with my kids and mom. They were great. My waiter was super sweet, the chicken tacos were awesome and the atmosphere was relaxing. My kids were really happy and so were we. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to Urban Tacos for the tacos. I know what your thinking if you're reading my review... The tacos should be good when the place has taco in the name.  In any case, I recommend the Castillo (beef) taco.  Plus, I like the Pollo (chicken) taco. I love the nice variety of house made salsas they offer here.  Plus, sometimes I like to get a side of rice and beans. They are tasty together and offer another flavor to my meal.  Also, they have other delicious menu items too.  In addition, the atmosphere here is fun and relaxing.  The servers are usually friendly and nice too.   Plus, they have a bar.  I hope you will enjoy stopping to try Urban Tacos out."}
{"text":"I loved this placed. The decor is great. The service is great. The short rib taco was great. I love anywhere that has a good margarita. And it is in my neighborhood. I couldn't be happier. You will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Omg the food here is sooooooo delish!  The meat is insane! We just came here for some drinks and apps.  My friend wanted sour cream and they were out.  The bartender came back in a matter of a couple of minutes with a side...he ran next door to Linger to grab her some sour cream.  Talk about high touch service.  I also love every time the owners are here that they recognize me, say hello and stop to chat for a few! Heads up taco lovers, They let us know about Cinco tomorrow and how they are doing $1.50 tacos  and happy hour ALL day...I might be back tomorrow"}
{"text":"Just stumbled upon this taco place when we were trying to find a place for dinner and we are SO HAPPY!!! Literally the best tacos I've ever eaten. I'm vegan, and the man serving us was so helpful. (Get the veggie tacos without cream or queso!) I'd return here everyday if I could. 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try out Urban Taco finally. When I got there I saw that the place was empty with no one in the parking lot. It looks like they decided to completely pack up their entire restaurant without a notice and moved in the middle of the night. I saw it was open on Friday and it looked so chic and decided I wanted to come in on Monday.  I tried calling and their number no longer works. SKETCH!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Short Rib Taco I have ever had. Urban Taco is a small business that packs in big flavor. The salsa variety was a fun experiment to try them all. We were with a large group so it was a bit harder to figure out what was what but with a table for 2 or 4, it would be nice. 

This place isn't a quick turn over restaurant. So settle in, enjoy the company and your salsas and you'll be fine. 

Beer, Wine and Tequila. Pretty basic here and done well."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly delicious. They have an unassuming storefront in a little strip mall off 16th st North of Bethany. The husband and I met our friends (Erin B and her husband) at Urban Taco for happy hour on Saturday night and happy it was! Their happy hour offers $1.50 street tacos, 5$ margs, 5$ beers, and 1$ off salsa flights. We decided to get 8 (yes... you read right, 8) salsas, guac, and a vast array of tacos. The salsas were awesome, with the table coming to a consensus that the best were the chimichurri, chipotle, avocado, and habanero (which was not very spicy at all) and the ones we would pass on would be the corn and garlic (really odd flavor), the roasted tomato (nothing too special), and the cucumber (some liked it, but it wasn't overly flavorful). The guac also was nothing special, so maybe pass on that. I had a short rib taco (which was really good, the meat was tender and flavorful), the braised pork (also very tasty, but a little less so than the short rib), and the pork belly and potato (pretty yummy, like a mashed potato taco, but the belly didn't stand out). I tried the octopus taco, and it was good, surprisingly tender, but a little fishy for me. I had a marg and it was standard, but a good deal at 5$. Happy hour goes until 7, even on Saturday. Check them out, I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Searched for tacos and ordered from Urban Taco
Good food fish taco was Excellent!!!  Good selection of salas"}
{"text":"Driven by here many times because the signage made me think this was an order at the counter kind of place which I haven't been looking for.  Everywhere was PACKED Sat. night and we were about to give up and go home when we drove by here and decided to give it a shot.  SO surprised when we walked in!  GREAT Ambience- friendly welcome.  Server was friendly and the owner come over several times to check on 'everything'.  The food was terrific- HUGE burritos.  Only down- was the chips- not homemade which made me sad, but the salsas were good.  We will definitely go back for 'chic' mexican."}
{"text":"Loved this place! First impression -  AWESOME. I love hand crafted, rusty, eclectic stuff and this place has just the right amount.  The owner was really nice and made a some of the stuff himself like a old drafting table into a dining table. 



Then the margarita came - pretty decent! Waitress was really attentive. But the food - Salsa sampler was amazing and the Urban Street Taco's were great. I had the short rib, braised pork and octopus asada. The pork was the best and the octopus was a nice spin on street tacos but I'd probably do all pork the next time. 

Really enjoyed everything and the price was right on a saturday afternoon outting with the girls after a fun day Vintage shopping on Cave Creek Road in Phoenix. So glad my friend Christina suggested it!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here on the way home from work after a long shift and was pleasantly surprised! Really loved my blackened catfish and shrimp taco plate ( I got the street taco style) and you can choose from 6 different kinds! The plate comes with beans and rice ( which you can substitute). Also had their house margarita which was good. Regardless of the varying reviews, this place is worth it to check out and I for sure will be back."}
{"text":"If you're in the area you have to stop by for Taco Tuesday. $1.50 tacos! There are different specials everyday. 

This Taco place is not some hole in the wall nasty floor taco shop. You walk in and its a clean hip taco shop with great decor on the walls. Has a modern rustic feel. The bar seats about 10 people, but the chairs are too high and too close. I would suggest getting a table if available. 

As first timers we got the Queso fundido. The cheese isn't a traditional queso fundido but it was still tasty. I do wish the chips were made in house. The chips are store bought. 

The tacos were really good. The size of your palm taco size. Good portion of meat as well. The tacos come with one salsa of choice. Habanero was spicy but missing some flavor.

The service was great! Sweet server and always checked on us.

I do plan on coming back to try the gourmet burritos and salads."}
{"text":"Love this fab restaurant! The food is delicious- portions very generous and all the different salsas are unique and so yummy that's it's hard to choose!  (I just got 'em all!) My son is already planning what he's going to order on our next visit. :-) The friendly, helpful staff makes the experience even better!  If you haven't tried these tacos, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"so much better than taco guild not even close and no wait list to deal with. the short rib tacos and blacken fish taco are to die for."}
{"text":"WOW.  This is not your typical Mexican restaurant, but boy is it good.  Urban Taco has an upscale feel while still remaining very friendly and welcoming.  Definitely stop by from 4-7 pm for cheap margaritas and $1 off \"street\" tacos.  I sampled two tacos off the gourmet tacos menu.  The Costilla short rib taco was exquisitely tender and delicious, but my favorite taco was the Baja Shrimp taco, which was filled with plump shrimp.

I think Urban Taco's secret may lie in the spices and salsas.  We tried the pico de gallo, cucumber (ended up being one of my favorites, what a surprise!), avocado and garlic crema, chipotle (lots of spice but great flavor!), roasted corn and garlic crema (sweet and unexpectedly delicious on the chips), and chimichurri (fresh and herbal, my other favorite of the night).  I would have been satisfied with a basket of chips, a margarita or two, and a selection of the diverse yet delicious salsas; the amazing tacos were just the cherry on top.

Great meal, great service, and all for a great price.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem!! In a nutshell: fantastic food, fresh & legit margaritas, mouthwatering salsas, great prices, and super cute ambiance! Don't let the location in an outdated little strip mall deceive you. Nice HH with drink specials including $5 classic margs, discounts on craft margs, beers, and wines (incl AZ Stronghold Tazi and Rosé!), and $1.50 street tacos. You can fill up for $5!! Other menu items include flights of salsa -- of which there are 12 or 15 -- HUGE burritos as big as your head, gourmet tacos that are about twice as big as the street tacos, and yummy queso fundido. Food is extremely fresh and delicious. Margs are made to order with fresh juices. My sister got the jalapeño ginger marg... I took one sip and about died -- so for those of you who like spicy, get it!!

Come to this place; they are a wonderful mom-n-pop alternative to the Z Tejas down the street."}
{"text":"Love the salsa choices and the sangrias are delish! The servers are always so attentive and service is quick. The dining room is trendy but inviting. Urban Tacos is definitely the best tacos in this area."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had the 3 street taco lunch special. Had the pollo asado (very good), the short rib costillo (awesome), and the octopus asado (meh, not great). The speial is 3 street tacos, rice and beans for $7.95. They bring out 2 sauces and some pico with chips to start. The sauces are flavorful but really wimpy as far as spicy. The have other sauces, a habenaro and a red pepper that they brought upon request that were hotter, and hot and also still tasty. Service was spotty, good at first, but they got slammed around 1:00 and then she was gone. It's a small place, so there was only one person out front. Also had a decent arnold palmer. I'll defintely give them another try."}
{"text":"I had the carne asada burrito. I wasn't a fan. $13 for an average burrito. Place was clean and chic but I wasn't expecting a sit down restaurant where you pay for salsa. Definitely not a quick place to get a place to eat."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Urban Taco twice; once in the restuarant and once takeout. The restaurant has a great atmosphere. The decor is rustic with dim lighting and the restuarant was decently busy for an early week night happy hour (good sign, right?). My husband and I ordered all the Happy Hour street tacos. The short ribs, chicken, and pork tacos were basic, nothing spectacular. But the octopus must have been over cooked because it was really rubbery and difficult to chew. I'm not a connoisseur of octopus by any means, as I have only tried it a few times. But I know it shouldn't taste like that. I left a little discouraged but happy that my bill was super cheeap! My take out experience was slightly better. I had no intention of eating Urban Taco again but my husband surprised me with takeout tacos. The tacos were better (did they get a new chef?). The blackened fish was delicious, the chicken was rather generic tasting, the catfish was extremely salty, and the shrimp was not so good. The shrimp taco may have been better had the shrimp not been breaded, leaving me with a mouthful of carbs and no taste of shrimp whatsoever. Basically, I would begrudingly eat there again in hopes of having a better experience."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful neighborhood restaurant. Great service and wonderful food. Love having great restaurant in the neighborhood to walk to."}
{"text":"We had seen Urban Taco many times from the street on the way to and from our usual haunts in the neighborhood and finally we decided to check it out.  The concept of the atmosphere is what's in style, for sure, but the execution of the rustic/industrial concept needs a little bit of work.  We sat at what looked like a bar, but upon further inspection was a U-shaped amalgamation of bespoke knee-busting tables, setup in a manner that precludes about 8-10 people from joining the glorified community table setup (fake bar!).  I say fake bar, because when I ordered my margarita, the employee went in the back of the house and emerged with the \"cocktail\" a minute or two later.  Maybe he didn't want me to see him pour the Costco margarita mix in the glass, I don't know.  

So we sat here, weren't really greeted, whatever, etc. I can live with it.  Then we ordered a flight of salsa, which came out lickety-split.  If you're highlighting salsas in my opinion, your chips should be delicious.  These chips were store-bought, room temp, nothing special.  So we're sitting there and assessing the situation - it's busy, pretty good atmosphere, 1/3 of the items are palatable so far, so we ordered tacos.  We tried all the street tacos, they came out fast.  They were all pretty damn good, but the plate came and nobody said what each taco flavor was, just dropped the dish and left.  Octopus was the only discernible visual difference between the four varietals, and the least exciting.  The other three were nice, tasty morsels.  Then we realized the music.  What a buzz kill.  It was a hodgepodge of about 10% classic rock, and the rest is what my wife referred to as \"adult alternative.\"  It sounded neither urban, nor rustic, nor taco for that matter!  Long story long, the bill came and it was taco Tuesday and about $20 total, so I have to go back.  At a regular price of $40 for two, I'll be down the street.  If they step it up, it could be a really great neighborhood spot!"}
