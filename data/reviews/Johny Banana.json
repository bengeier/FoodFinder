{"text":"These arn't the most authentic burritos ure gonna find, but that doesn't mean they aren't good. There delicious!!!!!! Used to pop in here when i lived closed by for my fix and i was never dissappointed. The hottest salsa is pretty mind blowing.....which i love. The interior is pretty chill and casual. Good place to go for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Possibly the worse service I've ever had. We walked into an empty johnny banana's around 6:30pm. A person came out from the back and greeted us. We told them we were going to sit down and the guy nodded \"ok\".   After 20 minutes we realized we haven't been left menus to look over or asked for drinks even. It was a ghost town. Seriously there was no one else in the restaurant sitting down or who came in to order out.   We got fed up with the lack or service and ended up leaving.   I've had Johnny Banana only one other time and it was pretty good but the lack of service to me means I'm never going back there again.   They need to get their act together."}
{"text":"This burrito is all about the sauces. You've got your typical fillings, but the avocado lime sauce is unique and fresh."}
{"text":"Dear Johny with one N,  Sure, your decor is cute and cuddly. Sure, your menu is impressive. Sure, you offer lots of fresh ingredients, BUT,  where was the flavor? I ordered the small chorizo with potato, but sadly, it was mostly potato. And chorizo is supposed to be spicy, but I didn't taste any spice in it! Also, the small is incredibly small, almost like an x-small!   One good thing was the dulce de leche cookie, but for $2.75, really? really, really?  Disappointed Diner, Dreamsrey"}
{"text":"Walking past this place, who knew it had changed from a sit-down all fancy mexican food served on plastic plate kind of place to a burrito joint? My eyes have been opened. Same plastic chairs and nacho libre painting- but with burritos only. The guy working the back offered up samples of Nopalitos to both of us- that's cactus.  I've had it before, but loved the sample on the fresh tortilla chip!  Anyway, I ended up ordering Cactus and the hottest sauce with guacamole. The guac is some of the best I've had, and the hot sauces appear to be home-made tomatilla, jalapeno and avocado- very green.  It's decent- a little runny, which would make it very difficult to walk down the street with. Also, not the cheapest. Needs more in the rice dept to soak up the liquid."}
{"text":"This little place used to be quite the gem.  Food was prepared fresh, piping hot, and exactly to your liking.  In what looks like an attempt to cut down on costs, they shut the kitchen and set up the food prep to be done at the front counter, deli style.    The food is now prepared in well in advance and simply assembled upon order.  The prepped ingredients are scooped out of tubs with a ice-cream scooper into a wrap, the meat is heated up in the microwave.  Meat has been dry, wraps have been refridgerator-cold on the inside.    I've been 3 times since the changeover, thinking that just maybe I was there on an off day...  nope,  all 3 times the same disaster.  For $7-8 a wrap, I could eat better at Burrito Boys, and that's not saying much.  Too bad, too, cuz they used to be one of my favorite spots for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I'm going to agree with Connie T. The burritos here are tops on my list and to throw in dulce de leche cookies! I don't need anything more.   This place is very stylish and clean on the inside, green and orange walls, dark chairs, beach wood tables, long burrito bar and comfortable banquette seating. Love the giant luchador  that welcomes you upon entering.  The service is one of the best I've ever received from any burrito joint. Super friendly and no matter how long the line they are willing to take the time to make your burrito proper and talk to you.   Flavors are what really make this place stand out. From chorizo to avocado shakes this establishment screams authentic flavors with a stylish feel. My favorite burrito place in the city bar none.  Overall, come and try something out of the ordinary like chorizo or cactus burritos, you won't be disappointed. The price is a little high for the quantity received but definitely worth the $2 extra for some amazing flavors. Finish with an awesome dulce de leche cookie and you can thank me later."}
{"text":"Johnny Bananas is a true authentic Latin American restaurant, unlike any other in Toronto.  Started by a Mexican couple, this restaurant used to have a full menu and bar, but it has since been turned into an in-and-out kind of joint.    There are a lot of places to grab a burrito in the city but no one uses fresh ingredients like they do.  When you eat a burrito from other places, you usually feel weighed down and tired after.  You won't feel that way after eating anything from JB's.  Highlights for me include:  Cactus tacos, fresh guacamole, alfalfa sprout burrito.  And surprisingly enough, their side salad is fruity and delicious.  Meat eaters will still rejoice in their menu, have no fear.  Because of the location (tucked away on Bathurst Street) and Toronto's burrito-obsession, I think this place doesn't get the credit it deserves.  If you're looking for another Burrito Boys you're not going to get it here.  Be prepared for something authentic and original.    Everyone there is really nice and the vibe is cool.  You won't want to walk away with the food, but rather eat in and read a paper instead."}
{"text":"I originally posted this review in error on Johnny Bananas in Yorkville, which I have never visited, but I may have to after reading the other review about that taco joint.  I do not like this restaurant, because I feel that it lacks authenticity and I would not eat here again.  Reasons I don't like it: - there is no coriander to be found, anywhere - They heat up the taco shells in a George Foreman grill - the flavours, while not bad, are not authentic  I admit that I am a taco elitist and there is absolutely nothing WRONG with Johnny Bananas - there are even some positive things:  - it is clean - they make the food for you in an open area that you can see - the decor is pleasant  The bottom line for me though, will always be that these tacos just do not stack up to the roach coach catering truck in San Jose that I love so dearly and use as a yardstick for all Mexican offerings."}
{"text":"I may be burrito biased because my first experience was with Burrito Boyz and while I would have no problem going back to Johny Bananas, my burrito taste buds still belong to Burrito Boyz.  I ordered the Chicken with Mole sauce and my wife had the Chorizo and potato. After I got my food I didn't realize that there was a Cactus burrito (brain cramp) and would have liked to try that because its so unique.  The first thing I noted is that they heat up their tortillas on a George Foreman type of grill, and it doesn't warm up the whole tortilla. I found that this type of heating vs how BB does it makes the tortilla shell doughy. The second thing I noticed was that they put a lot of sauces on the burrito (which is a good thing). The problem with that is we both could hardly taste the meat in the burrito. The meat was a small player in the composition of the burrito.  I was expecting this place to be a restaurant type of place until I saw some reviews, which I would classify it as a Fast Food joint. Although they do serve beer, they do not serve their 'signature drinks' anymore. There is no spicy hot chocolate or margaritas.  One thing that irks me is that guacamole costs extra. I don't understand why. Overall the burrito is fine, but I'm still a Burrito Boyz fan. By the way, the medium spice is HOT!"}
{"text":"Johny Banana's opened on Bathurst when I lived mere blocks away, and I never visited. This is a sad reality, because I recently learned that they have amaaazzzing burritos.  I still am 100% loyal to Burrito Boyz, but I like Johny's for a couple other reasons:  a) Prettier interior + better seating. Posters of Mexican wrestlers! So fun.  b) More effective delivery system. Receipt has your number on it, they yell your number, and you don't have to deal with little velcro number things.  c) Friendlier staff! And alcohol on the menu.  Burrito-wise, they are delicious and, yes, very neatly wrapped. Also, you can get whole-wheat tortillas! They also have a Salad-King-esque numeric spice rating -- I had a 3 and it got rather spicy near the end where all the sauce gathered. But I have friends who can tolerate 4 no problem, so if you like spice, go for a 4 or 5."}
{"text":"I recommend Johny Banana for two things:  1. The spicy hot chocolate, which NOW Magazine once voted \"best in the city\" (with reason). Extremely rich, dark and chocolatey.  2. The burritos (obviously!). I had a tasty cactus burrito (yep, sounds weird, I know) with guacamole and various dipping sauces and it was really great. The atmosphere is serene and comfortable, unlike some other rushed burrito dining experiences, and the service is polite and efficient."}
