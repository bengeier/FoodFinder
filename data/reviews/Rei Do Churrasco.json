{"text":"We have visited Rei twice since it opened last year.  I ordered the lamb the first time which was very tender and flavourful. On the second visit I ordered the chicken which was juicy and delicious.  The owners and the staff take great pride in their food and service.  Highly recommended. 
P.s.  I found out that now they deliver too."}
{"text":"My family and I ordered from here for my sister in laws baby shower and the food was amazing. We had beef, chicken and the fish and everything was cooked perfectly !!!!! I would highly recommend this place.

{"text":"Never order delivery!
My food arrived 1 hour and 35 minutes after the order was placed. According to Kangaroo, the driver company, the restaurant didn't request pick up until 1 hour after the order was placed. The food was packed terribly, both bags were visibly leaking, even the driver noticed. The food arrived cold and the quality was 3/10, I'm so mad I paid $9.80 for delivery. Never ordering from this place again."}
