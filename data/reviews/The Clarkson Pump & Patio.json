{"text":"A little more upscale than your typical pub and filled with an older crowd. Service started a little slow (it was a Monday night, around 6:30pm), as it took about 10 minutes for a waitress to come by after we were seated. After that, everything was smooth sailing and the food came out quick. We started with the cajun wings; they're small, but tasty. I got the chicken panini with the chicken curry soup (can't remember the name) and both were really good. Boyfriend got the hamburger with fries and enjoyed that too. We took a piece of strawberry cheesecake to go and it was so soft and fresh, topped with huge strawberries in a light sauce.  The reason we checked this place out was because we were given a gift card. It's about 30 minutes from us (being downtown), therefore we probably won't be back just for that reason. But if we were passing by and needed a bite, I'd definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are great taste and value but general menu very pricey for a place like this, staff excellent, best patio around. Lots of regulars here and a safe bet overall. Had lunch rib special recently, great taste and price, everyone ordering it, happy customers, well done kitchen staff!"}
{"text":"I'm from Syracuse and Yelp helped me find this Canadian gem. The facility is clean and welcoming. The staff very cordial. A good selection of draft brews. The menu is great. I look forward to returning soon and often."}
{"text":"Nice pub in the heart of Clarkson Village with rather modest interior. At least the back of the side room where we could get seated after half an hour waiting on Saturday night.  And wings were perfect! Worth waiting for.  Traditional choice of sauces though."}
{"text":"I have been going to this local eatery for years and had many good, basic pub-style meals here. I have to give it only two stars because on my recent visit, the wings (that used be excellent) were the smallest, scrawniest things I have ever seen. They should call them chick wings as they look as if they were taken from baby birds. The new renovations look great but please reconsider ordering wings if you decide to give this neighbourhood spot a try."}
{"text":"This is my favourite patio in Mississauga.  The service is always good. The food is usually good. I ho because it's close enough for me to walk to and from.  I like beer. I like wings. Easy to meet up with friends. Great pub"}
{"text":"We decided to go to Clarkson Pump last weekend with another couple because it was close to their condo! Let me just say the seating was over crowded and the tables way to close that you can't get by without interrupting someone at their table while they were eating! The guys ordered Korean short ribs, one person had veal chops and I had the beef dip! Let me just say that the Korean ribs were terrible! So TOUGH you could not eat them! I was surprised because short ribs are always tender when i cook them! Cost was round $22 next the Veal chop was dry, over cooked and as tough as leather cost around $22 my beef dip sandwich was good! Lets just say if your a pub and can't make a good beef dip your in trouble lol  My friends decided to give the place another try since they were there 6 months prior and were not happy with the food! All i can say is that we won't be going back! Please have items on the menu that you can prepare properly and make it a meal that is delicious and get customers coming back!!"}
{"text":"This has been my go-to pub/restaurant for years and it has never disappointed. It has a great atmosphere, good service and good food/drink. A nice place to hang out with friends either inside or out on the patio, eat lunch/supper with family or take in a game. It's quite popular and gets busy, especially during games but I've never had too much trouble getting a spot nonetheless."}
{"text":"The original go to spot. Great food. Great patio. Great service. What more could you ask for?  Make sure to get a vicinity card. After just a few trips for their famous was now we had a gift card plus some free apps."}
{"text":"We have been going to The Pump for 10 years. Never thought of it as a bar more of a family restaurant with lots of TV screens around to keep us up to date on baseball, football, hockey, soccer,etc. The food is very good with wings, ribs, and finger food topping the list. Always see lots of families and hockey, baseball, and soccer teams in for a team celebrations. Springtime opens up the outdoor patio which almost doubles the size of the restaurant. Staff is is always upbeat and willing to serve. It's always great to go into your favorite neighborhood eatery where everyone smiles and knows your name!"}
{"text":"Went here on a recent visit to Mississauga. Great location, good food and friendly service. I was surprised how kid friendly it was too.  I had a burger-it was good by pub standards. My friend had the steak sandwich-she said it was delicious. They have a range of kid friendly options that saw my friend's twins indulge in some chicken strips and a bowl of buttered pasta. Maybe not the healthiest of kids options but good for picky eaters. My friend said she finds their kids' menu prices a bit pricey for what you get ($6 for buttered noodles) but they enjoy going there.  Next time I'm in town I would love to check out their patio-it was huge and looked like it would be a fun place in nicer weather."}
{"text":"There are 3 locations of the Pump in Mississauga: The Clarkson Pump, The Port Credit Pump and I can't remember the name of the new one.  each location has a great local pub feel, and no mater what day you go there will always be regulars around the bar joking with the bartenders and wait staff.  I find the portions to be very generous! Yesterday I had a craving for a burger so dropped in for the banquet burger which comes topped with bacon and cheddar cheese....and they are not stingy! In fact I only had a salad and raspberries for dinner at home later because my lunch was so filling.  I meet with my Mississauga friends at different locations so expect more reviews and photos now that I am using Yelp :)  Also.....there is a very good size patio at the Clarkson location and the Port Credit location which has been around forever as well has expanded I'm size pretty significantly, plus there is the new location a mere 10 minutes away.  Success breeds success!"}
{"text":"I have been a few times already to the Pump with my former coworkers (who happen to work right next door to it) and I had a blast every single time. Excellent location in the heart of Clarkson village, nice layout including patio and an excellent menu. Has quite a variety of drinks and good choice of food - always enjoyed their appetizers. Last time had the wings as well which they tout as the best in the world - and they are indeed awesome! Service has been flawless every time with friendly servers and also nice patrons (enhances the experience - no drunk obnoxious people).  Will always come back with pleasure to this place."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoyed dining at this restaurant. The food is ok. The staff are great. We found our waitress Stephanie very friendly and prompt. She made our dining experience much better.  We loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"They charge $1.10 per wing, and they are so small I asked the server if they were chicken nuggets!  I've added a photo to this review so that you can see that I am not exaggerating when I say that they are the smallest I have ever seen. The servers were nice enough, but with so many other places nearby, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly hometown bar type place."}
{"text":"A few friends and I have been coming here for years! So much so hat we have come to get to know some of the servers. Most of them are great and attentive but it does get pretty packed on certain nights and patience is a must.    Tuesday's are half price wings and their wings are awesome. A bunch of different flavours and don't hesitate to ask to mix flavours like hot and honey garlic. They will double toss them for you. We usually get ours grilled (less calories) but either way they are delicious.     Most pub food joints don't have great food other than your standard wings and chicken fingers or burgers. This is where the pump sets itself apart. They are what I would say a little higher end pub food and I have yet to have an item off the menu I didn't like. I personally recommend their salads! Appetizers the nachos are a MUST! They could feed a small village! Also their pastas are quite good as well. Either way you won't be disappointed here.     Oh and in winter time they have a nice fireplace going. If you have a large party I recommended making a reservation for the busy nights because it's not a big place.     Eat well and prosper!"}
{"text":"K seriously? I live midtown Toronto...about an hour's drive away from this pub. But I have a friend who lives nearby. Whenever we hang out, rather than meeting somewhere half-way between midtown T.O. and Mississauga, I ALWAYS suggest hitting this place (hour's drive be damned) because the wings are just that good!!  If you like giant, meaty wings with chewy skin, this is not the place for you. These wings are on the smaller side, with perfectly rendered skin. And they're tasty as all get-out. I order mine 'medium' with a side of honey-garlic sauce for dipping (don't knock it till you try it).  Tip 1: the server will ask if you want them \"grilled\"....don't. Get them as is. I much prefer original over grilled.  Tip 2: the sweet potato fries are way better than the regular fries.  Tip 3: for a nice alternative to beer, try the Molson Cider in a glass with ice!  WINGS WINGS WINGS WINGS WINGS k I'll stop now"}
{"text":"So, my husband and I were visiting from Williamsburg, VA. We didnt know anyone in town so we had to rely on Yelp on where to go. We did want to settle on a place where  there were truckloads of tourists. We live in a very tourist-y town and I know how annoying that could get. Based on great reviews we found this place! There was a band playing, the staff was really nice and the food was great! I'm not sure when we will be back in the Toronto area but we will sure would come by again whenever we are in town!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday afternoon. It was busy. We were seated by a server promptly. We had wings, burgers and some beer. Service was excellent. Food quality is average. Nothing stood out. Definitely not a cozy bar. More like a watering hole."}
{"text":"Best wings ! So much so I really don't want the word to get out, I'm that selfish about it.  Its all in how you order - double grilled? something like that and that one flavor you have not heard of.....  My bf usually does the ordering - I should listen up! ha If I only lived closer to this place!"}
{"text":"Great menu, I've tried almost everything and I love it all. Salads are phenomenal. Love that I can always get a Somersby or one of their great cocktails.  Staff is always friendly. Great location, it's nice to walk down the street to the park on a Sunday after lunch and drinks.  They have events, like Leaf players coming and contests. It's great.  Sweet potato fries are great! Definitely check them out.  It gets busy and can be a bit loud but it's always fun and good spirited.  Desserts are yummy!  Really can't go wrong - make this your go to spot and you will be glad you did."}
