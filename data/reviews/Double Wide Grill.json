{"text":"Very friendly staff. A unique place with vegan options. I love the salads and lentil vegan burger. Sweet potato fries are a nice side to go with it."}
{"text":"Place is surprisingly good! At first glance it looked like a tourist-trap kind of place (think south of the border) but we tried it out and it was awesome. After realizing it wasn't a trap, the atmosphere was pretty cool - open air drinking. 

The beer selection was good, but more importantly the grub was great barfood. We had the nachos which were delicious (spin on the simple nacho-cheese style) and the seitan nuggets which were AWESOME! I would definetly go back."}
{"text":"I would have never gone here on my own because I'm a vegetarian and the name just doesn't sound like a place for me.  Boy, was I WRONG!  What a pleasant surprise!  We had a large group of 11 and there was plenty of room to relax.  The atmosphere was so comfortable and we didn't have problems talking down the table with each other.  

Being a vegetarian, the menu was fantastic for me!  So many great things to try.  I can honestly say that I have never been out to eat at a restaurant that serves seitan gyros.  I was so excited that there were so many CHOICES FOR ME!  

Adding this to our list of \"go to\" places.

PS Check for a Groupon!"}
{"text":"Very, very loud, large screen tvs (during final hockey game of olympics), less than subtle gas station theme, large, casual, good for kids. Atmosphere included - I kid you not - a large bald man lounging full length on a leather sofa in front of a television with an empty nacho plate in front of him - just like home! We sat in a comfortable booth.

The wings with signature hot sauce were very good without the breaded feeling that cheap wings have. The sauce was delicious - medium hot with butter and garlic notes. I'd like hotter and order \"tearjerker\" sauce on the side next time for dipping. Lots of creamy blue cheese and a few veggies. At $1 per wing these should be good.

I had turkey burger \"rebel yell jalapeno\" style, switched to cheddar instead of swiss. I thought I went with a healthier choice but probably not - greasy, very buttered roll, super thick almost compressed burger with odd sausage-like flavor, a few pickled and fresh jalapenos didn't qualify as \"rebel yell\" to me as I could have used hot sauce. Side dish of broccolini could have been skipped - over buttered, under salted, and server didn't bring utensils (my mouth was full when she checked on us and I gave up by the time she came again). Overall I'm sorry I ordered and ate most of it.

Others ordered the beef burger (extremely thick, oddly spiced), fries (described at fresh cut I expected them to look and taste more like real potatoes you know like the zoo - hmmm, maybe overcooked a bit, not very salty), brisket sandwich (meat good, bbq sauce very not nuanced).

Service was good, other than forgetting the utensils, everything was as it should be including requesting cheese switch and mustard on side.

Overall, I wouldn't return for the food. Maybe a wing or two with a beer."}
{"text":"Double Wide is a place I like going to in the summer. I love the outdoor seating and it doesn't get rowdy at this end of Carson. The waitstaff has always been quick and response. I've only had the BBQ but its always been good. They have a pretty minimal beer selection compared to other Southside establishments but still decent.  If you want a good relaxing night out in he Southside, I would suggest Double Wide."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE GREASEY FOOD.So gross is all I kept saying as I looked at all of it..well what we got of it. Picked up this order and thank god they left half of it out anyway.Will NEVER go there again, the Irwin Pa. One at least.Called to tell them they left stuff out of the order but whomever never came back to the phone.Just a terrible all a round experience."}
{"text":"The vibe here is nice. It's right in the southside with a huge outdoor seating section that allows for friends to get together and hang out. It's a great place to grab a cocktail with friends and enjoy the weather.

That's about all it's good for because to call this barbecue is a joke.

Again my southern roots don't fail me when it comes to traditional food. 

Barbecue is supposed to be cooked for long periods of time on low heat to allow the flavor to set in whether it's vinegar, tomato, or mustard base the premise is still the same.  

Here you can tell that the sauce is an after thought. The meat ends up really kind of dry with little to no flavor.

Service varies. The 1st time I went I had the most amazing server who was sweet and attentive without being over bearing and I loved her. Even though the food wasn't great I thought to myself at least the service is amazing.

 The last couple of times I've gone (always with friends to just grab cocktails before we went out somewhere else) the service has been beyond lacking.

All in all, if you're looking for a cool spot to laugh it up with friends on your way somewhere better in the southside, Double Wide is your place. However if you're looking for tasty barbecue, try to find some place different."}
{"text":"This is the only place I've ever seen before that has vegan BBQ food, and man is it great.  I had the BBQ pulled seiten sandwich with vegan fries and garlic coleslaw.  Super good.  My meat eating boyfriend even said it was good.  They were packed when we got there but we were seated in a timely manner.  Our waitress was very nice, wasn't overbearing and didn't hover like some do.  I would definitely go back asap.  Yum!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is Seitan Wings! For all my Vegans trying to curve you Hot wing cravings this is the place! 

I was in Pittsburgh for work and my awesome driver found this place for me. I wasn't sure what to expect since I hadn't been to many Bars that had vegan options. I 'm from Texas where beer and BBQ go hand and hand not meatless wings. I was thrilled to be able to sit at the bar have a beer and enjoy a vegan meal!  The staff was helpful and friendly . This was my first time to Pittsburgh and Double Wide definitely left a lasting impression.  Great Food and great service. looking forward to my next visit to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Ugh. I don't know if brunch just isn't the best time to eat here or what, but we had a bad experience on Saturday. My beloved seitan \"wings\" were hard as rocks (like so hard they were difficult to cut with a knife). Our waiter went AWOL. My son didn't like his cheeseburger, and he likes almost anything. On the plus side, well, they have some Jenga-esque game that kept my kids entertained until our food arrived."}
{"text":"This place has a BIG veg. menu.  The seitan wings are very good!  There regular(aka chicken) wings are good too.  Great during the day, but very busy at night.  Good mixed drinks and a pretty nice beer list.  The pulled pork was good(not excellent).  I usually stick to the wings when I am in town."}
{"text":"Great vegan options, however the service, while super friendly and lovely, is quite slow, and the food is amazing, however they're often out of quite a few things, so have a few ideas of what you want when it's time to place your order..."}
{"text":"This place really hits the mark   Nice ambiance.   Wonderful selection of beers on tap.  Above all, the food is delicious:   The ribs are super tender and fall off the bones.  The pulled pork is juicy. Great sauces.  Crispy grilled brussel sprouts (awesome veggie of the day).   All around great experience."}
{"text":"Was in for lunch today. The service was terrible. I ordered the turkey Devonshire and it looked nothing like the picture on the menu.  It didn't taste very good either.  My Friend had a burger that was overdone.  The cherry coke slaw was tasty. This is the third and last time I am eating here."}
{"text":"The food is good,  but over priced. Do NOT bother going here for karaoke.  The waiters make it clear they don't make money serving in the second section and won't come see if you need anything or get you another drink,  and the karaoke guy is the worst I've ever seen.  Way too loud,  complicated to put in a song,  He's up there singing when there is a room full of people,  and if your a new singer you get passed by in the rotation.  He's also incredibly rude.  Good beer selection though.  The place has the potential to be good,  it just isn't there yet"}
{"text":"I stopped here on a whim for my burger and was decently surprised. I had one of their house made sodas and a burger and both were delightful. The service was alright, but the waitresses were dressed a little trashy for my taste. I think I've seen classier outfits at Hooters."}
{"text":"RUde, indifferent service to start with. Our drinks were loaded with sugar-GRENADINE SYRUP. I asked for an alteration. The nasty waitress said: He will make you another one but you wont get that one for free (i wasnt looking for FREE, i wanted a palatable one)

THe tv dinner items were stale, overcooked and tough. We summoned the manager who was confrontational. He said his brisket was award winning!!!  IT WAS TOUGH and dry..

He was very combative with us. We showed him the yucky old potatoes they srved us and he said \" YOU WANT A FREE MEAL, THAT IS JUST WHAT YOU ARE GETTING AND COME BACK TO SEE US\""}
{"text":"Some friends and I tried Double Wide and it wasn't bad. 2 out of 3 of us are picky waters and we found something on the menu to eat. 

I had the whole wings with sweet bbq and they were cooked perfectly. I really did like the sauce but after while it lost its flair. 

My friends had a burger and fries and a TV dinner with brisket, sweet potato fries and pork, mashed potatoes and cherry coleslaw. They both enjoyed their meals. 

I do plan on going back when I'm a bit more hungry and trying something else. 


The portions were a decent size too"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!  No where else have I been able to eat my own vegetarian diet while watching my husband blissfully eat his carniverous one!  He says the pulled pork sandwich is his favorite, followed by the ribs.  I am just so happy I can find tofu AND seitan cooked well in this town! I like getting the TV tray dinner, which I still have not been able to finish but gives me the option to ahve a variety of different dishes.  Oh, and the cornbread is AMAZING! Great selection of beers, fun place to watch a game or grab dinner.
Mindy, the server, is awesome too!"}
{"text":"Just ate lunch for the first time at Double Wide. Had the pulled pork tacos and the double wide salad. The tacos were good, but I was expecting the pulled pork to have a sauce on them, maybe a BBQ? I liked the salad and the addition of sunflower seeds for crunch.

Waitress was friendly, and to finish we had the death by chocolate cake which was tasty, but really when does chocolate cake not taste good?

It'd be a fun place to have some beers and grab some appetizers. I'll be back."}
{"text":"While visiting my brother up in Pittsburgh, we needed a good after-workout meal. He is pretty carnivorous and I'm vegan. A little bit of scrolling around on Yelp, I found the DWG, which wasn't far from my brothers apartment. The menu looked very accommodating for both of us.

I am very pleased we gave this place a try. There were so many good options for both of us. I got the seitan wing-bits and the vegan gyro. The house hot sauce is very good. A little bit of heat with a little vinegary zing. The gyro was loaded with all kinds of good stuff. My brother also said his meal was very good. They had a nice big beer menu too, with a lot of brews I recognize and even some I didn't. Though, since we just got done exercising, drinking wasn't on the agenda.

The waiter was plenty nice and attentive. Though, being as it was only about 15 degrees out, the place was kind of empty. The interior design is pretty cool, kind of a throw back to classic cars and gas stations.

If I lived in Pittsburgh I would visit place often. They pretty much have something for everyone here."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! I've been to their location in the South Side and now North Huntingdon. The menu is right on with how people like to eat now a days, and the atmosphere has a very cool vibe!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped for Sunday brunch on the way home to Ohio. We both had drinks- She had a Bloody Mary and I had the \"Back in the Saddle\" special (can of Tecate beer and a shot of Jose Cuervo for $5.50). Wish we could have stayed longer as they did have a plentiful drink menu with many fun drinks we would have like to tried. The atmosphere resembles an old-time gasoline shop, a little grungy, but very warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"2nd Amendment (not 21st) bar. (Look them up.) 
Sat at the bar to find the woman next to me had a gun in her waistband. Fine. Whatever. But is taking a gun to a bar a good idea? I told the bartender. His response: \"lol I know her she's a good friend. She won't hurt ya\"

These are the same owners who ran Rowdy Buck until its fatal shooting http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2017/06/29/Man-charged-homicide-Rowdy-Buck-bar-shooting-Pittsburgh-South-Side-Holyfield/stories/201706290230

Did they learn nothing? If you or someone you love is shot at one of their establishments, you have a legitimate wrongful death case."}
{"text":"First time was great..... Second time completely sucked sent two drinks back..... Just awful service nothing like first time here and hardly anyone is here first time there was noooo room"}
{"text":"One of my favs in general but did you know they will cater their deliciousness for meetings/lunches? They brought awesomely yummy boxed lunch in a snowstorm for our training. The all vegan fare we got for this meeting surprised even the biggest carnivore with how good it was. Def use them again!"}
{"text":"Terrible. I find it to be overpriced for what you get, and the food is mediocre at best. Been here several times, have yet to leave satisfied. Won't be coming back. 

Most recently ordered the jerk chicken... Didn't expect it to be so incredibly greasy, and there wasn't actually much chicken there (mostly all joints--got served a plate of bones and tendons).  Not worth the $14 that was paid."}
{"text":"Old Review: *****
This place has been my favorite for a while now, but when they teamed up with Elysian Brewery (based in Seattle,) my top nearly blew. Always a good time with good people here; great selection of beer and the seitan wings are the best item on the menu! Other positive aspects of this place: Bloody Mary's, Happy Hour prices and grilled veggies. Just don't try to get a job here: The manager will make you wait for two hours and then tell you to come back another time.....

New Review: *
Grouchy staff + barely edible food... At least they still have delicious seitan wings!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The atmosphere is pretty cool, kinda has a old car garage look and they turned it into a restaurant. The outside patio is nice too. Plenty of seating and they even have a dog patio which I think is amazing. Don't worry it is another section outside in case you don't want someones dog around your food. 

Each time I have been there I had the Tijuana balls. They are amazing I love them. I also had grilled veggies appetizer. It was good, big slices of veggies but that's not an issue for me. My first time there I had the pulled pork sandwich and have to say I was not a fan of the BBQ sauce. To me it only tasted like vinegar.

The drink selection was also great I was impressed. There are pictures of each drink which is something I really enjoyed, as I am a visual person.

Overall I had a good experience and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Chicago and called ahead to see if they took reservations. We were told Sundays were slow so we headed on over.  The  first thing I noticed was the waitress and hostess dressed in very short shorts and skimpy tops..on to the service....very slow. We waited quite a long time for a waitress. We asked if the appetisers could please come before dinner. They came at the same time, after a long wait. I have to have gluten free and the one gluten free appetiser was stuffed mushroom. The cheese wasn't melted entirely and it was cold in the center.  Wings weren't anything special.  We had to wait a long time to get our check which was pretty pricey.  To be honest the staff are very low energy and don't seem to care about their work. Whomever is doing the hiring may wan to consider work ethic and intelligence rather than cup size.
  Also, I am not feeling well and I think I may have been given gluten.
After reading some other negative reviews for this restaurant I wonder if the owners read their Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"Great place to bring out of town guests, or to go with people who have different dining preferences.  This former gas station has a cool garage-themed ambiance with a friendly (though not always very attentive) staff.  They have a pretty diverse menu, including many vegetarian and gluten free options, as well as ribs and other BBQ fare.  There is also a huge outdoor patio, with a sectioned-off space for those who want to dine with their dogs. 

I highly recommend the brunch. The lunch/dinner menu can be hit or miss. For vegetarians, I recommend the coconut curry tofu, the potato tacos, and the veggie chilli cheese fries, the salads, and everything veggie on the brunch menu. I would probably stay away from the lentil veggie burger unless you like a mushy burger. The seitan \"wings\" are interesting, though not necessarily good. They also have a great selection of cocktails."}
{"text":"The food is gimmicky and not that great. The beer selection is top notch and the atmosphere is pretty cool. In the warmer months, the patio outside is excellent. I would give it a much higher rating if they could get their food to be better. I usually eat somehwere else first now and grab a beer there."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place and it was slightly disappointing. The seitan wings were delicious and a great choice, I highly recommend them. I had the trailer park punch which was advertised as \"Best cocktail Winner\" No, it wasn't. It was bland, and overall kind of yucky. For a cocktail that costs almost $8 I would like it to taste better. I had the seitan pulled pork sandwich, the bread it was on was a terrible choice. It was a multigrain bread that was super thin and it was hard to eat, and it was messy in a not delicious way.

My boyfriend had the pulled pork platter, and it was delicious. It had a syrupy, tangy sauce and came on the perfect bread. He left fat and happy. The creamy cherry coleslaw was bland, I was waiting for something special but it never came.

But overall, it was a nice experience. The decor is cool, the service is quick and courteous. I could see this place being fun in the summertime."}
{"text":"Don't let the rugged, garage-like exterior fool you -this place serves up some delicious, high quality food. The Double Wide is one of the first places I went to eat in the Southside, and its unique, vegetarian-friendly menu has kept me coming back.

I would highly recommend their vegetable tofu skewers (yum!). They come drizzled with BBQ sauce, which is a different approach to your average veggie dish. I'm also a big fan of their Saturday/Sunday brunch, during which you can find locals sipping on Mimosas and Bloody Marys. I usually order their tofu scramble wrap, which never disappoints.

Aside from its diverse menu, the Double Wide also has a really \"chill\" atmosphere. From its funky decor to its quirky staff, the restaurant definitely has a certain appeal.   I like to think of it as the hipster's version of Quaker Steak and Lube."}
{"text":"Used to live across the street from this joint, although the atmosphere is enticing, the food is lacking, so we were never regulars.  Now that we've moved to Bloomfield, I still venture over for karaoke night, which is very fun!  It is hit or miss, depending on the crowd you will sing 30 songs a night or be lucky to get 1 in.  The KJ has the best system jn town ( download his app!).  Love it when he sings!!"}
{"text":"They have a pretty nice menu. You can get something for everyone which is huge plus! They also have a fairly good kids menu compared to other places and give children more options than french fries and chicken fingers.

Every time we come here are food is served fairly quickly. I usually get the pulled pork platter and their bbq sauces are AWESOME, it's probably why I rated this place so high, just on the sheer deliciousness of those sauce alone. They go great with french fries or one of the meat selections (pulled pork, ribs, brisket, etc.

I love that fact that they have a doggie patio for the pet parents. I don't have a pet but it's nice to know thats one of the few restaurants who offer that option in the summer. 

The drink selections are also nice. We have opposite taste buds, I like my drinks more on the refreshing side, light, lots of fruits and berries, smooth, etc,  He likes his beverages strong, dark, with very rich flavor, etc, and we are always able to find a good drink to fit us both. 

It is slightly overpriced, nothing too outrageous. I think the last time we went here we spent over $60 for 2 adults and one child. I say \"slightly\" because you do have to factor in the amount for 2 beers and a mixed drink. 

Overall this place is pretty good. They get the stars mainly for the bbq sauce selection, the tender perfectly cooked brisket, and the optional outdoor seating in the summer months where you have the option to bring your pet."}
{"text":"No complaints. Delicious vegan food, huge menu with great variety. Fun atmosphere and fast friendly service. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Good beer selection, great people watching, best patio on the Southside easily.

Food could use some improvement, service can be nightmarish, prices are very high for what you get, and there is a real lack of decent specials. They have some good ones but they are very short - 9pm-11pm for food (and only if you eat in the bar side) - and I'm not even sure if they do drink specials. 

This place has so much potential. I am really hoping for some improvement in these categories. Even with those negatives, this place is still worthwhile for the attractive crowd - especially on a bright sunny day on the patio."}
{"text":"I was there 7/5/2014 & ordered a whole slab of ribs platter. The ribs were fall off the bone. However, the ribs tasted quite like they were baked & not smoked. They were overpriced. They didn't have any hickory or mesquite flavor. I told the waitress that. My fruit cup was not full. My grits were Ok but not delicious, but cheesy. The service was good, but my food was overpriced, more than $24 per order. That's why I only ordered water to drink. The atmosphere is good. I sat outside on the patio. For the price, I expect delicious and I didn't get that."}
{"text":"Lots of veggie/meatless options. I really liked the seitan gyro. The veggie lentil burger was very substantial and thick, nothing like a frozen patty. The seitan wings are large squares with a grainy breading/coating. Not the best, but not bad either. Good beer selection. One of the largest outdoor patios in the city."}
{"text":"\"All you can eat\" ribs on tuesdays should be called \"all you can wait for\". Went in for the first time yesterday Tuesday the 19th of August, and had VERY slow service. I waited only 10 minutes for my first piece which was great.  After that I waited 25 minutes for another serving. Then after I finished that second plate - HALF the size of the original - I waited 35 minutes for a third. After more than an hour and a half I had less than a single rack of ribs.

Sincerely,
Disappointed"}
{"text":"My husband and I, and our dog were eagerly looking forward to dining at the Double Wide.  We had read about the great food, and respected the owner's efforts to allow dogs on the patio.  However, on a recent Saturday afternoon, we were greatly disappointed, primarily, but not solely due to the poor service.  After finding a table, we sat waiting for approximately 20 minutes, until I decided to ask the hostess for assistance.  

En route, a server asked me if I was seated in the corner; and beckoned me to the counter (we had read a review a while back, and recalled that the servers were not permitted on the \"dog\" patio, but didn't know what we were expected to do).   He told me to grab a menu, and walked away.  A while later, he stood at the counter, yelled over, and said that he had forgotten to explain the specifics, namely, we place our order at the counter, and get our own utensils, water, etc.---which was fine, had he done so when we got there, minus the rude demeanor.  

As for the food, it was disappointing that only the brunch menu was availlable, but we managed to find a few items, which were just ok.  I'm guessing that dishes, glassware, etc. are not allowed because of the dogs, but food served on a paper plate without a side dish or even a garnish was very unappealing.  Our breakfast burrito was also cold, and for almost $10, should have come with something other than sauce.

Cocktails were also a joke.  I guess beer is the thing here, but we ordered mixed drinks and mimosas, which came in plastic cups barely larger than a dixie cup, and were definitely overpriced.

We are generally pretty easygoing, and don't tend to complain, but I have to agree with another reviewer that you feel like you have the plague in the dog area.  The waiter seemed put out that he had to deal with us, and at one point, another server ran in and grabbed some items left behind, and ran out, as though she might catch something.  
The final straw occured while I was waiting to pay the bill; our waiter presented a couple of large dog bones to the customers' dog right next to me, but didn't offer our pup a thing...I guess she didn't rate either!!  Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Double Wide used to be one of my go-to restaurants for the great mix of omni and vegetarian/vegan options, and fast and friendly service. I'm not sure what has changed over the last year, but my last several visits have been incredibly disappointing. Wait time for a table can be 30+ minutes though there are seemingly plenty of empty tables available. Orders have taken 30 - nearly 60 minutes to arrive even outside of peak hours. Despite the wait time, the food has often been cold and/or undercooked. Even when the restaurant is fairly empty, some servers rarely (if ever) return to the table to check to see if drink refills are needed, or anything else is required.

Recently, I visited with friends and their dog to utilize the designated dog seating/eating area. There are not a ton of restaurants in Pittsburgh to which you can bring your dog, most likely due to liability/health/safety concerns. In order to attempt to bypass these issues, the Double Wide dog area is entirely separate from the non-dog outdoor section, and virtually no wait service is provided. You must get up from your table and go across to the counter to order, pick up your food, and pay. Forget drink refills unless you want to serve yourself from a pitcher of warm water that has been sitting out for some time. You are served with paper plates and plastic utensils that you must bus yourself, and then spray and wipe the table down. Again, I get that having your dogs at a restaurant is a novel concept in this city, and that certain safety precautions must be in place, but it is just not worth the trip/cost just to eat with your dog here.

On a positive note, the food (when cooked properly) is consistently good, and the selection of vegetarian/vegan options rivals almost all other omni restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"I like sitting on the patio to eat here. And it's dog-friendly (you can bring your pups to eat on on the patio--very cool). Decent beer list. Food is pretty good, but disclaimer-I'm not vegetarian or vegan, and this place is known for that sort of fare. I think if you are a vegetarian or vegan, you would give this 5 stars."}
{"text":"Our very first time here and I have to say I'm impressed.  Great service which is one of my musts to return to a restaurant.  We will be back. Their corn bread kicks ass and so does their beer list!  Reasonable priced and great food.  I had the pineapple  chicken wrap which was  phenomenal!  My husband loved their meatloaf with chipolte gravy.  The corn  black bean fritters were great if that's something you like.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It is so refreshing to be able to go out to a restaurant and easily find vegan and vegetarian food. There are so many options for non meat eaters! I recently became a vegetarian so finding foods that are vegetarian friendly is still a challenge but The Doublewide made my dining experience effortless and quite tasty. My favorite dish is their Seitan Wings- bbq being my personal fav. The service is always very helpful and attentive. This place will be my go to from now on!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy to see more craft beer in the area! I typically like to go straight to the source and go to breweries, but this place is packed with local beers. I had a few appetizers with friends the first visit during happy hour and I can't wait to go back and try more. The nachos are definitely BIG, but delicious (you can tell the pico is super fresh). We had the boneless wings with honey garlic, oh my gosh, so good. And cheesey tots, so cute and hit the spot while drinking beer. Bartenders were great and really know the drinks. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"vegan friendly! great atmosphere. cool vintage looking gas station and crazy decor. the seitan wings are the BEST!! must try, even if youre a meat-eater!!! my go-to is the seitan cheesesteak, on a nice hoagie bun with grilled peppers & onions and a vegan cheese sauce. :) the bartender Anthony is the greatest!!! such great service every time. LOVE!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service and the bartender was a Browns fan. Doesn't get much better than that"}
{"text":"Visited the new Cranberry/Adams Twp location. Great food, atmosphere, service and now convenient location. Our new favorite for ribs. The sauce and rub are the best and the meat was lean and the bones pull out clean."}
{"text":"I usually go here for Sunday brunch after a weekend drinking. I tried on a Saturday night once but I was told there would be an hour wait, so we went next door instead. I never have a problem getting a table on Sunday though.

The food is great. I wish they'd give more than a spoonful of those seasoned diced potatoes though, they're so good, but you only get 6 to 7 pieces. I recommend the carnivore's omelette, though the steak and eggs is good too. The screwdrivers are always sting as well.

The decor is great too, and it's a great place to relax with a low noise level.... However! The reason I gave 3 stars? Every time they drop off the check you won't see the waiter again. Even after handing the check back and asking for a refill, you won't see the refill. In fact, asking the wait staff for anything is a task."}
{"text":"Wasn't crazy about our first visit around dinner time. Food and service were both so-so. Then went  about a month ago for breakfast with a friend and was impressed. So today we decided to go again for brunch. I was again disappointed. DWG apparently uses \"brunch\" to abbreviate breakfast. They list some of their breakfast items on their brunch menu under the same name but with less food. You have to add on and pay extra to get the same amount  you'd get at breakfast during the week. I think this is a very shady move. That being said, if you're looking for a gamble... Head to DWG. You may get a good meal, you may not. Better off heading down the road a piece to Cracker Barrel!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Amazing selection of food, definitely recommend trying the mac n cheese.  Best part is the dog patio available."}
{"text":"In a word: inconsistent. I have had some of my best Pittsburgh dining experiences here, but also some pretty bad ones. In general, the service is slow. Sometimes it's nice to have slow service so you can sit and enjoy the mealtime company, but sometimes the service is really, really slow.  Also, I have gone to the Double Wide craving their seitan wings and left disappointed -- it seems like they change the recipe monthly! In spite of this, I continue to go back because when the service is good and the food is prepared well, it's one of the best places I know. I especially like going for brunch. Although it's a gamble, we take out-of-town visitors here and they are usually pretty impressed."}
{"text":"Was there in August moving daughter into Pitt.  She's a vegan and this place hit the spot for all of us.  From service, to decor, to food...all superb. A friendly funky find."}
{"text":"Something for everyone!  Vegan to Carnivores. Great food and drink options with friendly service."}
{"text":"We ordered a couple of types of burger and a plate of mussels. All substandard that I would find anywhere. Fries were not fit for human consumption. That's it for me-- cross this joint off the list. Oh, and next to us was this white trash pair who wanted everyone in the whole place to hear that they are having fun! Real classy!"}
{"text":"This place is clearly very popular, it was filled the entire time we were there with many people who appeared to be regulars.  We went there for the veggie options.  The seitan appetizer was really good, and a huge portion, but the rest of the meal was not so great.
The service was kinda crazy.  Our waiter was nice, but pretty non-existent, and the rest of the staff seemed crazy and frazzled."}
{"text":"I like everything about it. The food was good as well as the atmosphere. Located in the heart of South Side. On a nice evening you have the option of eating outside under an umbrella which is a great option."}
{"text":"Totally not what I expected. The seitan wings were amazingly good, and the bloody mary was just the right amount of spicy. 

I ordered the Trucker Breakfast with the vegetarian sausage -- which was a slight mistake. The toast and eggs and potatoes were great, but the veggie sausage was off. It may have been the cooking oil as it had the odd aftertaste that comes with old oil.

I liked my pancakes as well. Although I wish the butter offered was real, or at least fresher. I think restaurants really miss the mark when they offer butter or creamer in peel-off containers. 

Overall however, very good. I'd like to try some other things when I'm back."}
{"text":"I guess that they were trying to go for trashy chic. What they achieved was trashy and a little dirty. Floors were dirty with piles of things (menus, trays, etc) everywhere. There were four of us and some of the dinners were interesting. My burger was terrible. Bun looked like it came from a grade school cafeteria (post Michelle Obama). Teddy's was bad. I think the location is cursed."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice during the day when there was no great rush. The burgers were big, tasty & filling. I need more of that in my life. Too bad I spend half the year in a different state. Definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"The pros are the outdoor seating and the BBQ dishes. Other than that, the food is not good. The BBQ combo platters are really good and you get a lot of food. I have tried other dishes, a grilled chicken salad, and it pretty much consisted of bagged lettuce with five pieces of grilled chicken breast. Outdoor seating is nice, though."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a friend. She's a vegetarian and wanted to go to a place that had more options for vegetarians than just a salad. This place certainly fit the bill.

We were seated immediately when we got there and our waiter was extremely nice. He was really on top of refilling drinks and even gave us a few beers to sample before we made our final choices. 

The food is a little expensive for what it is and it didn't blow me away by any means. It was good, but this is not a place I would crave anything in particular and have to come back. 

The food did come out pretty quickly and the service was great. They have a lot of vegetarian options too so it's good for groups with both meat eaters and non-meat eaters. Everyone will find something they will like on the menu. 

It was a bit cold outside so we dined indoors, but it seems like this would be a really great place on a nice summer night.

Go for the consistently good service."}
{"text":"food was really good, even though one of our dinners came out barely warm. They made a new dinner. Menu choices were excellent, I got the TV dinner with brisket and tilapia, really excellent. Server was very friendly and nice, however really didn't see her much at all. Interestingly enough, seemed like a lot of the wait staff really didn't seem to be overly friendly, like walking around with smiles or anything similar. Probably took. At least 4 or 5 minutes just to flag someone down about the cold dinner. So food selection was excellent, however they could really use some work on customer focus, if that makes sense...Memphis BBQ (the thicker BBQ sauce) was freggin' FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"Took my kids, parents and in-laws to Double Wide for lunch yesterday.  My brother and his girlfriend eat there quite frequently and have tried most of the menu (giving it all thumbs up).  My father and I went with the Pulled Porky sandwiches; my mom got the burrito; and my brother and his girlfriend went with Salads (darn them and their healthiness)...
I LOVED the BBQ and the sauce-on-side was lovely as well.  It doesn't look like typical BBQ sauce, but it rivals it in my opinion.  Even my father (73 and a persnickety eater) loved the BBQ and sauce.  Put on the sauce in moderation, however, as it does have some 'kick'.

A good place for family eating - as the kids were kept entertained by the atmosphere and decorating; and the adults were kept entertained by the people-watching, exceptionally friendly service-staff, and good conversation.

Keep up the good work and looking forward to coming back to relax on the patio for a lazy Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"It's very hard to get a drink at Double Wide's.  First you enter the restaurant and are made to wait at a hostess stand while the host or hostess ignores your party.  Then when you decide to go sit at the bar because you are tired of waiting around like a fucking asshole; you sit and sit and no amount of gesturing or gesticulation directed at the bartender yields your drink.  Meanwhile the bartender(s) are either updating their Twitter, \"I'm like, so @ work right now, LOL!!!\", chatting with their bff on Facers, or texting away like it's the first time they ever had a cell phone.  When you finally do get your drink, you better not drink it too quickly or by the time the bartender comes back around, your bleached bones will resemble a skeleton in the Sahara.  

Went in for lunch during the work week one time; big mistake.  First the whole getting told to wait at the hostess stand, in an empty restaurant, while she disappears for an inordinate amount of time.  Then the whole \"we have no regard for the fact that you might have to get back to work, so we're to take an hour and a half to complete the process.\" Seriously Double Wides, you've never had lunch customers that have to get back to work?  Lunch is about getting in and getting out, not about dessert drinks and seconds on pecan pie. 

Now, I'm not just being a gigantic malcontent for no reason.  I've been to Double Wides about 20 times and its always the same shite service.  Why do I keep subjecting myself to their lazy ways?  Well, the food is really good with a definite Southern flare.  Plus, if you can get a drink, they have an excellent beer selection and two awesome drink specials: $2.75 Jagers (anytime) and \"Breakfast\" one Tecate and one tequilla shot for $5.25.  SOLID.  

So Double Wides, stop hiring these hipster jerks that won't take your customer's drink orders and streamline the seating process; it's annoying as hell to get ignored.  Oh, and one more thing.  Get your science right about fraqing.  Nothing is happening to the drinking water.  Fraqing happens at 7500', the water table is at less than 1000' nothing is matriculating up through a mile of rock.  Naturally occurring methane (coal) is to blame for whatever wad the felonious Gaslands documentary has gotten your panties into.  GO GAS!"}
{"text":"Very hit and miss. Some items a great (the appetizers) and pulled pork, while others are bland and lack flavor, the fish tacos and chicken sandwich.  Decent Draft list. Best to go in summer and chill outside."}
{"text":"While I have family in the area this is the first time staying in the city and I was in the mood for some BBQ. The Double Wide Grill hit the spot. Service was great, food was wonderful. I just wish I had had enough room to finish it all in one sitting. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"REALLY overrated. I've been there 4 or 5 times - the food is OK, a bit overpriced - but the service has always been terribly SLOW - especially when there's a group of more than 4 or 5 people. 

I also don't really get off on sitting inside an old gas station - or - even worse - outside an old gas station."}
{"text":"For advertising as dog friendly this is one of the worst places to eat with your dog. The dog area is some sort of self service where you have to clean your own table, order at a counter, and retrieve your own food.  I understand that it must be some health code requirement that they do this but you can get full service at pretty much any other restaurant with a patio."}
{"text":"Oh, this place could be so so very good but really doesn't quite make it.  On the plus side is the large vegetarian selection.  The execution could be better as the meal that I ordered was a bit over done and the meal my sweetie ordered was a bit under done.  

I got a grilled portabello reuben sandwich and the mushroom was oddly overcooked.  Also the sauce was sort of off.  I can't put my finger on it exactly but it didn't have zest perhaps?  Also the fries were a bit soggy...

My sweetie got the grilled veggie burrito and her veggies were under done (well a bit raw).  Nice sauce though.

Service is prompt and friendly but a bit distracted.  The outdoor seating is nice though."}
{"text":"Located in a renovated repair shop, the Double Wide is chock full of character. There was a very nice verity of clearly marked vegetarian options to choose from which is always a plus. The BBQ Pulled Seitan was a great introduction to seitan (a meat substitute) if you've never had it before. I'd be tempted to come back just to sample more of the unique menu options. Unfortunately my wife's first choice from the menu was unavailable and the coconut tofu didn't quite hit the spot. Also, our server was a bit overloaded when we visited, but tried to be helpful in making recommendations. On the whole it was a fun place to visit & even though our visit wasn't perfect I would definitely recommend trying this place out, at least for the experience."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in years. So on my Friday play day we stopped in for lunch. This menu is packed with all types of goodies they cover all bases from your carnivore to the vegetarian. It's also have some neat nostalgic items all over the place. Friday is my food cheat day so I couldn't wait to spend my calories on something crazy good. I ordered the turkey burger with fries my son ordered wings. My waitress's was nice and we didn't have to wait that long for our food. My burger was ok not memorable at all. This sucks because I'm wasting my calories on a mediocre meal.  overall the experience was average"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner Sunday. It's a gas station converted into a restaurant which was cool. There was also plenty of outside seating. We ordered the dry rubbed wings as an appetizer, and shared the full rack. The meat was tender and fell off the bone, but it was not the best ribs I've had. They were also sparse with sides. Also a full rack of ribs came with only four onion rings (at an additional charge) and a small piece of burnt corn bread.  Keep this as your 2nd choice."}
{"text":"We were seated at 8:00. Our waitress didn't come to our table until 8:25.  I ordered the all you can eat ribs. After 2 plates and about 10-12 ribs I was informed that the kitchen closed at 9:00 and even though we had ordered all you can eat the last order had to be in by 9:00.  I told the waitress to quickly bring me another plate of ribs and asked her to be back before 9:00 so I could order one last round. At 9:05 she returned to the table with three ribs and walked away. My personal opinion is my order wasn't taken until approximately 830 why was I not informed that the kitchen close at 9? The point that I set for 25 minutes before the waitress showed up  didn't help my cause at all. They were not busy so it's not like  anyone was in the weeds. I would have much rather ordered a full rack of ribs and been done with it. The whole \"all you can eat ribs\" night was supposed to be fun, as any gimmick should be.  Anyway I will not go back there and I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone. As far as the food is concerned it wasn't bad. I would say a little bit above average at best."}
{"text":"First time to Double Wide was their opening night (we didn't know but waited SO long for it to open). They didn't have a full menu but what we had was great! We have returned multiple times and had great service along with good food. Lisa, behind the bar is AWESOME. She makes you feel so welcome!!! Also love that they kept a few Teddy's favorites like the chicken croquettes. Wonderful!!! I highly recommend and can't wait to go back! A wonderful addition to Irwin!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the staff was awesome. We were seated immediately and treated like family. The host and waitress were so personable :) the menu had so many vegetarian and vegan options, i was very pleased. This is definitely a place i will visit again."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in the southside. Pulled pork sandwiches and burgers were great! The place has a diner-type feel because it was a gas station turned into a restaurant. 35 cent boneless wings made for a nice appetizer. Highly recommend if you're looking for a nice place to eat in the southside"}
{"text":"This was my third attempt at giving the Double Wide a chance. 
Their food is overpriced, under seasoned and the service is spotty. 
. 
I ordered a chicken burrito (around $10). After waiting what seemed an unreasonably long time I received a shrimp burrito, but didn't realize it until after I had taken a bite. 
I am allergic to shrimp. 
I had to flag a member of the waitstaff down to let them know of their mistake, and then wait another half hour to get my chicken burrito. 
Meanwhile, our regular waiter was nowhere to be seen. 
The chicken burrito was probably one of the worst I've ever had. The quality of the ingredients seemed okay, it was just SO bland! 
It consisted of chicken chunks with no seasoning, black beans, rice and cabbage shreds. That's it. It was served with a hand full of tri-colored tortilla chips and a \"salsa\" that was also under seasoned. 
I ordered desert, an ice ream cookie sandwich. I was given 2 supermarket bakery-bought chocolate chip cookies with a scoop of ice cream between. 
The only saving grace was the frozen mojito I ordered, which was VERY good. 

as a whole my 3rd try was an INCREDIBLY disappointing experience, and I wont be back. 
Oh-never did get an apology for the shrimp burrito AND now I have hives all over my face."}
{"text":"I have give the double-wide a few more tries and have been pleased.  Service has improved.   the food is still good.   The atmosphere is funky-cool-good.  They have also seem to have gotten busier.....45 minute wait sometimes!   

It's back onmy place to go list!"}
{"text":"Not that good food was average probably won't be back fries were stale and corn bread was lousy pork was watered down"}
{"text":"The barbecue and grilled foods is great. I would avoid most appetizers except for the wings. Overall the food is good but sometimes the service isn't the greatest when it's busy."}
{"text":"best Seitan wings in the world. I'm not even vegan and I couldn't tell the difference between the Seitan and real meat. texture is incredibly like meat and so is taste. highly recommend"}
{"text":"I've had some pretty mixed experiences here; it's very hit or miss. Great place to surprise friends with their inventive vegan offerings. Good place to take kiddos as well."}
{"text":"Our last out of town on New Years Day and I should have been here earlier. We spent the morning driving around looking for someplace to have brunch, bloody marys and watch the football games. Next time I am in Pittsburgh this is my sunday brunch location.

Lots of TV's, the food looked, at least we got to enjoy a bloody mary."}
{"text":"A bit grim. 

I've been here a bunch of times because it's a great outside spot. Generally, I'm just drinking with friends out on the picnic tables and everything is great, but I brought a visiting vegetarian friend here for the veg food on a recommendation, and we were completely bummed. 

Seitan wings/chunks were DELICIOUS but served in an insultingly small portion for the price. Totally realize the labor involved (if they make it in house), but c'mon. It's friggin' wheat gluten. Felt like we were shouldering some Whole Foods tax. 

Fries were great. No complaints at all.

And then...potato tacos induced sadness. Mushy and watery, like all punishments to vegetarians should be. We didn't come close to finishing, we didn't ask for a box. Server didn't ask why. Apathy ruled the day.

Maybe it's a complete douche move to go to BBQ place and bitch about its vegetarian grub, but if a business is nice enough to include non-dead animal options, they should be good, right? Or at least priced relative to the cost of ingredients?

At any rate, it's a place to go for beers in pleasant weather, for sure."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place since it's around the corner from my house and I love BBQ. But I have never I repeat never had a good meal here and the service is chronically slow. 

Only thing they have going is an excellent patio that fills up fast when the weather is right"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed to give this double wide a less than stellar review. I have enjoyed the south side and mars locations but find myself out near Irwin a lot lately so I was excited that it opened. Mostly the negatives are service oriented, particularly bar tender service / attitude. The food and beers are great - except that the constantly run out of a few favorite beers ( \"oh that just kicked\" I hear way too often ) and don't stay on top of that. Biggest problem is that I have noticed, after a few visits sitting at the bar, that a couple of the women bartenders are cliquey with their locals to the point of neglecting or giving attitude to a pop-in customer. They have long ignored me in and given me attitude when they finally came over to see what I wanted, more than once. That's not something I've seen in other double wides myself. It certainly makes me think twice about stopping and that's something I'd think the management would want to know. Others I was with on my recent visit who live in Irwin  felt the same."}
{"text":"Vegan options are rad! Not your average sad veggie burger options. Service was great, beer selection is good! We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Food was very good and my wife said the brisket was the best she had ever had.  Busy Saturday night - the wait was only 15 min but it took longer than expected for our meals to arrive - server apologized for the delay - deserts to go where awesome later!"}
{"text":"Greta spot to check out if you're a fan of BBQ but also if you're looking for some alternative eats and are trying to dip your toe into throwing more veggies in the repertoire. They make the transition from meat to non-meat pretty seamless, and they have a kickass beer selection."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the staff was very nice! BUT, the food was awful. Everything was definitely frozen. Kid's Mac and cheese was definitely Kraft and reheated. Make your own TV dinner is such a cute concept, but everything on the tray was awful. Frozen vegetables, colorless carrots, pulled pork that disintegrated when you touched it, and yellow crusty potatoes. We brought it to the attention of the very sweet waitress. She came back from the kitchen with a plate of fresh mashed potatoes, and new pulled pork (still not good). Why would the kitchen put out old food, if they have fresh??? More ridiculous (and partially our fault for not making a bigger deal) was that the virtually untouched food (including the new food) was not taken off the bill! We wasted $100, don't waste yours!!"}
{"text":"Not great at all long wait. Service was fair, got their steak and tasted burnt vegetables too had to wait awhile for steak sauce. Husband got a burger said it was OK. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The BBQ Pulled Porky is absolutely delicious! The staff was personable, fun, and helpful in suggesting local favorites. We enjoyed looking at the auto memorabilia stashed creatively in the decor. Hope to return!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Irwin. There gluten free buns are unreal, almost can't tell the difference.  And the Bloody Mary is to die for. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wait time for the meal was longer than it should have been.  They weren't really busy when my family had lunch there.   The menu is huge.   I wish they would do fewer menu items  better.   My wife ordered a steak and it was well and burned.   It might be new store opening pains but I have heard through the grapevine that this is common for the DoubleWide.   I hope they focus on getting the food right or it will be Teddy's all over again."}
{"text":"Great food, super fun atmosphere & honestly the service was the very BEST we've had! Kia waited on our group of 20 boisterous family members as we celebrated our brother's 60th birthday. She never faltered! All the orders were correct, water glasses filled, drink orders timely. She even cut & served the birthday cake. By the time we left the restaurant we were hugging & kissing her. Lol. There aren't enough ways to say thank you!! We'll be back."}
{"text":"Good bbq restaurant. Love how they have some spicy items in the menu. Got grilled chicken breast and unfortunately it was overcooked and dry. I think that a bbq restaurant should be able to grill chicken correctly. Would have given them another star otherwise."}
{"text":"Omg. I was in Irwin this evening (haven't been there in a while) and saw that a Double Wide Grill had opened. I remembered seeing something about gluten free options and since my daughter is gluten intolerant, I thought 'let's try it.'  BIG mistake. Both my daughter's dinner and my dinner were well below average.  Nothing in my 'California Salad' was California-like at all. All vegetables were old and honestly rotten. I can't believe a place of this caliber could remain open. I guess people have grown accustomed to mediocrity.  They couldn't even get the fries right. They should have named them 'double-fried' fries. I walked out with a 50 check for garbage and it left a bad taste in my mouth. Our server was pleasant but that was it."}
{"text":"Do not expect to find decent beef bbq here.  Previous reviews led us to think there would be good beef bbq, which was on the menu and which we ordered.  The beef that came was like crockpot-cooked roast beef.  When we asked whether it was smoked, we were told it was \"braised.\"  Look elsewhere for smoked bbq beef!

The service was competent and friendly, and the very informal atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner while visiting my friend in Pittsburgh. Mixed emotions about this place. One thing we agree on, they definitely need to hire more staff! Service was slow from the get go, took forever to place our order, get our order, get refills, etc. My husband and friend liked their dinner. I was unimpressed with mine. Nothing tasted very fresh. I was also amazed, for such a big menu, they were reluctant to make any changes to how I wanted my food customized. I've never encountered that before. I don't think I'd ever done here again honestly."}
{"text":"Decent restaurant. However, the last time I went I did not receive my full order and they tried to make me happy by giving me a \"discount\" of $1.35. Additionally, the food I received was very mediocre."}
{"text":"Double Wide Grill is an old gas station converted to a bar and grill. I am a sucker for places like this! The corner spot is perfect for the bikers who hang out there and the eclectic decor is cool.

I ordered a Hogaarden, which I get very excited to see on a menu and I got Tilapia tacos for dinner. Never had that kind of fish taco before, and living in San Diego has made me accustomed to getting breaded fish or Mahi Mahi grilled. I loved the Tilapia though! It came with a side of rice and black beans too.

The food was better than expected, based on just the overall feel of the place. They had a few veggie options like grilled tofu and a veggie burger. Good for families, large parties and just plain old fun!"}
{"text":"SECRET VEGETARIAN HAVEN!

Came with \"THE VEGAN\" and was told by my sleek, sophisticated health nut friends that this place was not a burger joint but in fact a haven for vegetarians and vegans in the South Side! Indeed the menu selections were extensive unlike many places limited vegetarian choices.
I actually had a hard time deciding on what to get and chickened out and ordered a salad! PUN PUN PUN! The grilled veggie and brie salad (I can't EVER give up dairy fools!) This was hearty meal and the lime cilantro dressing was a good suggestion.
\"THE VEGAN\" got the veggyro... seitan instead of lamb...was tasty but more sweet than savory. Corn bread was also tasty for \"being up north\"
I will go back to try out some of their other vegetarian items!"}
{"text":"Love it! Relaxed atmosphere, good beer, and the dog patio makes this place our go to after a long day."}
{"text":"I was very excited to go here since there are so many vegan options, it's a definite plus. I ordered the veggyro with red pepper rice and my sister ordered the pulled seitan sandwich with a fruit cup. It's a great place to watch the game or have a big group. When our food came they got my sisters order wrong and didn't put tomatoes or lettuce in her sandwich. They also gave her coleslaw instead of her fruit cup. I thought the seitan in the veggyro had way too much sauce spilling out of it too. At least the food was good and the service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I had been hearing a lot about this place and was excited to finally try it out!  The service was not out-of-control great, but the food was, and it was an overall pleasant experience.

We went at about 9 pm on a Friday, and sat outside, which was great fun, and the BBQ was in full effect, the charcoal smelling awesome.  One thing that was a bummer was that we were excited to try the sweet-potato-and-carmelized-onion croquette appetizer on the menu, only to be told when ordering that they were out of sweet potatoes.  Bummer!  We settled for the onion rings, and they were great, a huge portion with some amazing sauce.

I got a burger with the fresh fries, a mountain of them, which were delicious.  I also tried a frozen mojito, which was something I had never tried, but was also tasty.

I like the atmosphere here and I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Double Wide about a dozen times and have never been disappointed with the food.  My favorite is the Rubin and I am still trying to duplicate the sauce they serve with the sweet potato fries!   The servers have aways been friendly and right there when we needed them
 My partner is vegetarian and always enjoys being able to order tofu anything!  Not a lot of restaurants in Pittsburgh offer tofu unless they are Asian."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was alright, we were seated quickly and they were polite. The waitress didn't seem to know much, she was unattentive and I felt like she just wanted to get us out the door. 

They are a little pricey for bar food, a lot of vegan friendly items. My friend and I ordered pulled pork sandwiches both with corn bread. We both didn't care for either. The sandwhich came with barbecue on the side, and I'm glad it did because the sauce was awful. The corn bread was burnt on the bottom.

Overall, I didn't care for it I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Solid selection of vegetarian and vegan items at an American BBQ and grill style restaurant. Items are very clearly marked for veg or vegan, making selection easy. The veg dishes are mostly seitan, tofu, or vegetable/portabella based.

In the warmer months it is lovely to sit out on the patio to enjoy your meal and relax. The patio is very dog-friendly and many patrons bring their favorite pals along with them, leaving trails of \"oohs\" and \"aaws\" from other restaurant-goers. Service is typically quick, friendly, and knowledgeable of the menu-items. Double Wide is a good selection for a quick lunch or dinner for what you expect at a sit-down restaurant. 

Drawbacks for the vegetarian items are that they seem to be out of stock of items on a somewhat regular basis."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the least dog friendly establishment I have ever been to. It is highly advertised as \"dog friendly\" but in fact they completely isolate you and your party from the rest of the restaurant. In addition to that, it is beyond self service. We had to move our own table together, wipe and clean it ourselves and then you must walk up to a counter to order drinks and any food items. You must also pick up or drinks and food yourself at said counter. The worst part is in this area all silverware, cups and dinnerware is paper/plastic. The food took a terribly long time and food was not the best. There are open trash cans lining the area for you to then bus and dispose of your waste. Compared to every other establishment I've been to that is dog friendly that has outside seating or a patio where we have been treated as every other customer just with an animal companion, double wide grill was just not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Service was quite poor and food was expensive for brunch.  One person ordered an omelet and it was served as a scramble and served cold.  A kids meal was$5 for an\"omlete\" without any toast or side... Also served as scrabbled what.. That was another $1.50. it was served dry and our waitress disappeared after she served the food. No refill on coffee, no checking to see how anything was.  We had to ask for creamer after we flagged another server down.  After we realized the toast was dry, we again had to flag down another server because ours was no where to be found.  Food was decent, but too expensive. For two adults and one toddler we spent $40. There are too many other better places with better service and food to return here."}
{"text":"Food was very good for bar food. Wait time to from ordering to service poor but give them benefit of the doubt to work out the kinks. At this point, indifferent to bordering on rude to take out orders. That said..... love the concept and the food. Staff is friendly and solicitous. Just hope the kitchen picks it up. Soft opening and all...it's understandable...so wait and see."}
{"text":"Amazing seitan wings!  Doublewide is a fun party restaurant with great variety of gourmet food rich in flavor.  It's so nice to see so many clearly labeled vegetarian and vegan options on their menu.  Everything we ate exceeded our expectations.  The only disappointments were the absence of vegan desserts, and the noise level of the restaurant was very loud in the main garage.  The bar section was actually much quieter. But being a party restaurant that's exceptionally fun themed, one shouldn't expect this type of place to be quiet."}
{"text":"Great food and really cool atmosphere. Get the Philly cheeseburger!"}
{"text":"Best vegan food ever! The place was converted from  a service/gas station into a trendy restaurant. Cool vibe with covered outdoor seating as well as indoor (obviously). Our water Tim was great and very knowledgeable on the best vegan options. 
Sorry I don't have food pics, ate it too fast. We had the seitan wings and the lentil aloha burger. WOW both were incredible!!!!"}
{"text":"I read almost every view before walking in. Most of their issues seem to be around service. I experienced it on multiple occasions but the management seems to be a aware of it and is actively working on it. The food is good. I really appreciated their gluten free menu and knowledge. 

We were in town for a wedding from Southern California and we're glad that we didn't have to search too far from our hotel. 

One other suggestion is the temperature of their food. In most occasions the food was luke warm. Most of the times I ordered food to go and with the short drive from my hotel to the restaurant (less than 5mins) food was just coming out of the kitchen still like warm. Fix these issues and you got a 5 star hit!"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible experience. After 45 minutes still could not handle a party of 9.  Had to go to another local place. And after talking the \"the manager\" you could tell she didn't give a $hit. Once the new place allure wears off this place will fail."}
{"text":"When I lived in Pittsburgh, I ate here quite a few times.  On a recent visit back to the 'burgh, I met up with some friends to recollect and enjoy some vegetarian-friendly fare.

The Double Wide has a cool vibe because of the refurbished garage/gas station environment.  The memorabilia and decor capitalize on the history, so there's plenty of old gas-station signs, old oil cans, old hubcaps (...you get the idea) to look at.

The menu also playfully embraces the location's history, with plenty of old-time diner options, BBQ, and burgers.  The twist, of course, is that there are plenty of options for vegetarians and vegans.  Tofu and seitan abound.

The outdoor seating provides the perfect vantage point for people-watching and for observing all the craziness and/or quirkiness of Carson Street. 

While this is all fine and good, there's really nothing spectacular about the food or service.  The greeters and waitress weren't particularly cheery, and the food is a bit underwhelming.  I suppose if I was a vegetarian, I'd be much more delighted.  Still, it's an okay place to check out, especially if you're visiting the South Side.  Try to get a table outdoors when the weather's nice (and when Pittsburgh experiences a rare sunny day)."}
{"text":"I've had pretty average experiences here. For a place that can call themselves a vegan-friendly joint, I was pretty disappointed. 

The few times I've been, I keep hoping for the seitan wings to get better. They haven't. Two times I got violently ill from them, and I'm not new to BBQ sauce or seitan. After that, I stopped trying. I returned once more to meet friends and only ordered the Junkyard Nachos to prevent further damage to my stomach. The BBQ sauce was definitely delicious, so I give them some credit. The food is your typical fare of bar food and basic restaurant dishes. My carnivore friends rave about the food though, so if you aren't vegan/vegetarian, it's worth a shot!

Drink specials are not bad. I've returned simply to have a drink with friends, but likely won't have a full meal involving seitan again."}
{"text":"The menu is confusing, it will list that a dish is served with rice and daily vegetable. It also says you get two sides. If you get the two sides, you don't get the things the meal comes with. We were confused, asked our waitress, who was completely clueless. If you order stroganoff, you need rice or something. We explained we wanted the meal as served. She was rude and acted like it was our fault. Food was cold."}
{"text":"Great selection, delicious food and friendly service! Lots of options for vegans and vegetarians and plentiful in items for people who like meat."}
{"text":"Went with family on Saturday night, so no excuse for not being at their best.  The menu is very extensive so it was hard to chose.
Started with the nachos which were good.  Came with a side of dipping cheese which was a pleasant surprise.   I was leaning towards either the ribs or a burger but the waiter recommended the brisket so my wife and I both went with the brisket sandwich.  I was expecting a heaping mound of brisket on a bun but the sandwich was so small that I literally finished it in three bites.  Without the fat it would have been two bites.
My daughter had the chili fries and the were also disappointing.  The fries were mixed with what appeared to be chili made with brisket but the dish looked more like soup than chili.  It was so soggy that the she didn't really eat it.  She also complained that it had no flavor, probably because all the liquid drowned out whatever flavor there was.
My son had the boneless wings.  He didn't eat them as he was in a bad mood so my wife and I cleaned them up.  They were the best part of the meal with the buffalo sauce being a very good flavor.
Overall, vey disappointed but the waiter was so nice we didn't feel like complaining.  Anyway, won't be back.  Too bad as its a nice place with lots of outdoor seating."}
{"text":"This review is for their brunch which is served on both Saturday and Sunday.  (3 stars for lunch or dinner).  It was a rainy Saturday and our group was glad to sit outside under their porch for a very lovely brunch.  I was somewhat skeptical as their food for dinner is just mediocre bbq.  I was pleasantly surprised they had a huge brunch menu with lots of options I wanted to try from omelets to French toast and pancakes.  I went with an omelet that was served with brie, apple slices, and walnuts.  It was delicious and these toppings were actually put on top of scrambled eggs but nevertheless a great combo.  The dish also came with potatoes and a slice of fruit.  I would love to go back and try the pancakes which others in our group ordered including chocolate chip and blueberry which looked fantastic!  They also have lots of fun drink options including a bloody mary and mimosa.  The service was excellent and our food came out very quickly."}
{"text":"Mediocre all around.  Seated quickly at a high-top in the bar, server quickly came to take drink orders. I ordered a beer, my girlfriend ordered a sangria. My beer was just barely on the cool side of room temperature, her sangria was awful. Ordered chili cheese fries, they came quickly, and were OK. I ordered their burger with jalapeños and cheese, she ordered their chicken sandwich with bacon and cheese. Food came quickly, but when it came out it came out backwards (i.e., the toppings for the chicken were melted on the burger and vice versa). Food was taken back and brought back out ~10 mins later. Burger was oddly (read: poorly) cooked. Inside was pink (ordered cooked medium, so OK), but the outside was charred to the point where the burned taste overpowered everything else. Chicken was overcooked and tough. I ordered a second draft beer when the food arrived, the temperature didn't improve noticeably.  Server returned as soon as our mouths stopped chewing to ask about dessert and rush us to get the check (bar was only half full at this point, and karaoke had started about 15 mins prior, so I didn't understand this move).  Check arrived, and I was surprised to see nothing had been adjusted after the kitchen mix-up. Paid, left, don't plan on returning. Also, they allow children in the bar after 10pm, so if this is as off-putting to you as it is me, steer clear.  It's been about a year since I've been to the southside location, but as I recall, it was MUCH better."}
{"text":"The Tuesday all you can eat ribs are just a joke. The ribs are cold inside and served with lukewarm fries and crappy coleslaw. The beer selection was good, but food is just too bad."}
{"text":"As you can see from my profile, I rarely leave low star reviews. But the brunch we had at Double Wide Grill really bothered me throughout my day and I felt compelled to share my experience on Yelp. 

My friends were in town from Chicago and we wanted to sit somewhere outside, so we tried Double Wide since they have a big patio. The patio was really the only good thing about the experience. Our server seemed clueless. She took our drink orders which included bloody marys, beers, and 3 waters. She came back a long time later empty handed and said \"they are still making the bloody marys\". Great, well bring the waters and beers then!!! It's hot as sh*t outside and how hard is it to bring water right away?

We ordered our meals, my friend got a veggie omelette. Instead, he was given a meat lovers omelette. My friend got the wrong side with his meal. The service overall was slow and lackadaisical. 

As for the food, it was not memorable in any way. You could get this type of breakfast food at any diner or Denny's. Brunch is about unique creations and stuffing your face. The portions were not up to par either. This will not be a place I go back to for brunch."}
{"text":"Dear lord why are you punishing me at food places lately?!  Do I not serve you well!?  Do I not praise everything and appreciate all the amazing food places you've sent me!?  Why God, why now are you punishing me with some of the worst meals I ever had the last few weeks!?

I had a choice, go to the tried and trusted P.F. Changs for dinner or open my mouth and say \"hey let's try somewhere we never been\"!  I just knew the Double Wide Grill would be awesome cause there's always people outside dining and it's been here awhile but I'm starting to think people just put up with crappy food cause they're afraid to say how they really feel for fear of everyone saying they're difficult or picky but I refuse to spend any dollar amount on crap food or keep my mouth shut about it because in the end, crap food wastes your time, your money, your patience, your enthusiasm and if it really sucks, makes for an awful bathroom experience.

This place has GRILL in the name so ya know, get a burger!  I was gonna get their brisket but the waitress informed me they were out of it.  Ok, burger it is.

...
....
.....
This cook had to be high or drunk cause only a high or drunk person would send this food out...


Before I even discuss this, Texas Toast is THICK cut bread right?  I mean any time I've ever ordered it or seen it, it's ALWAYS been big thick bread.  Well take a look at my bread in my picture, does that look like Texas toast or wonder bread, I say wonder bread.  Again I said NO PINK, not burnt black just no pink was my only request, same as my partners request.

They came out moo'ing of course.  BLACK on the outside and PINK on the inside.  Since when has making a burger with no pink but not burnt been such a hard thing to find!? 

 The fries felt like they came out of the trash bin, cold and grease smothered.  My \"Texas Toast\" bread was mush (see video) and the mashed potatos I ordered were cold and really just tasted like garlic and nothing else.  The Bloody Mary I ordered while I waited was a cup of horseradish and tasted like sink water.  

The manager came out to try to remedy the issue and he gave us a $10 gift card and asked if we would come back which was nice but it still didn't counter balance his constant attempt at justifying why the food sucked.  Just say \"this looks like shit, this is a bad representation of us and when/if you come back I'll make right\", Don't go on and on about \"well I mean maybe cause, and well it is close to close and this is like this cause, and this and that\" just say it sucks and move on!  What is it with managers lately trying to sneakily blame the customer or make them seem like they lack an understanding of good food???  It pisses you off more than the food being bad!  Which brings me to my next point, I don't care if it's 5 minutes before close, a hour before close or first thing when you open up, the experience should be consistent across the board!

My waitress seemed cool, but she seemed just there to get a check, not sell me on what is awesome about the place.  She actually recommended places to go other than there!!!

Ya know, the first impression is everything, so when I go places I've never been I specifically say to our waitress/waiter \"I've never been here before, what do you suggest, I want to experience what this place is about\" (EVERY TIME it's a new place) and when they look at me like \"uhhhhhhhhhhh\" lol, um ok cool, let me figure this out!  Where's the training and ENTHUSIASM for where you work?  

My partner did say she thought the cranberry cole slaw was good so I guess there is some silver lining to the story, even if it is still pink in the middle."}
{"text":"I ordered a 15$ pasta dish. Normally these dishes twice the size of what I got. Finished the dish and was still incredibly hungry, I weigh 150lbs so I'm no fatass either."}
{"text":"Doublewide is double good. Again and again.
Tonight was all vegan. 

Started with the wings.
Dinner was the California salad, beef stroganoff, and the seitan gyro. All were amazing. The stroganoff was voted best vegan in Pittsburgh. No surprise, it was!
Ok now the 'meh'...they've added an almost vegan (honey) dessert called the Goo Ball. Don't do it, yet. It's too dry, not remotely gooey. Boring.

But we don't judge by the Goo Ball! Love Double Wide and can't wait to go back in a few days!"}
{"text":"The ONLY reason they are getting more than 1 star is for their brunch...  Otherwise, their dinner menu and service are mediocre if not completely unsatisfactory.  

Needless to say, there are 2 reasons to go to the Double Wide Grill:
  1. Brunch: Their breakfast is well worth the lack of service
  2. Vegetarians: If you need to satisfy a vegetarian palette, there are many options and a lot of them are even good."}
{"text":"Always good food and great service here! We love the seitan wings and the pulled seitan sandwich. The vegetarian TV dinner never disappoints and the beer choices are the best! I did a flight of beers the last time we were here. Unlike your local brew pubs, you can sample from 40 or more fun choices of brew. We have been enjoying their menu since they opened. They consistently deliver fun, creative food and drink."}
{"text":"I don't think I would have stopped at the Doublewide if I didn't have a $10 off coupon from restaurant.com but I'm glad that I did after a walk on the southside my wife and I was starving and decided to give the Doublewide a chance not want to risk a lot of money we ordered the large salad and the ribs brisket and pulled pork combo being from the south I know  what good barbecue is and we were not disappointed the ribs were fall off the bone good sauce was excellent everything was prepared perfectly. We already made plans to stop back next Tuesday for all you can eat ribs and I plan on putting them out of business by eating every rib bone they have.  And we have antistate service"}
{"text":"No, no, hell NO! I've given the Double Wide Grill two chances, and have been dissatisfied each time. High prices, plain food, slow service...the only thing nice was sitting outside. My smoothie was watery and my portion of food was smaller than expected. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Quick Review: Good food with surprisingly accessible menu (vegan, vegetarian, etc...) and great bar. 

More Detail: 
When I first tried Double Wide (probably 2009) I hated it. I thought the food was average at best and the service not great. 

But after a long hiatus I tried it again and was pleasantly surprised (this was 2016). Now it's a favorite for our family. 

I love the pulled pork and ribs, while my wife adores the brisket. I have also had their salads, burgers and sandwiches- all good. If you are indecisive try the TV dinner (build your own combo). All of the portions are huge (which is appropriate consid some meals are close to $20).

I find the appetizers to be hit or miss. Tonight we tried the buffalo dip (too much Bleu cheese for my taste). But I've enjoyed the nachos and wings previously. 

The kids meals are a great deal. Drink, meal, side and dessert for $6? I like that! 

Give it a shot for solid bbq and veggie/vegan options."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this diner and was immediately greeted with a very friendly hostess. Waitress just as friendly and the food is very good. 

My only ding is the French fries were a bit stale. Tasty but they seemed to have been sitting around a while before served. 

Overall a good place and I'd come back in a heartbeat"}
{"text":"We came here for Father's day today, and to say we had a disappointing experience would be an understatement. There was a 25 minute wait, and there was hardly anyone in the restaurant. But we waited, once we were finally seated we promptly ordered. Our waitress seemed miserable. Our food took a half hour to arrive. Once we got the food, it was mediocre at best. The astronomical prices you charge for the actual portions of food is truly absurd. $13 for a breakfast burrito and side of home fries... There was maybe a quarter cup of potatoes on my plate.  Our total came to $40 for three people. Aside from this, I am most upset because I tried to take my dad out for a nice Father's Day brunch and I very much regret coming here. I contemplated saying something while we were there, but there did not seem to be anyone of authority or anyone who cared to be there."}
{"text":"They have a great gluten bread.  I really like the quality of the food but I miss the $3.99 breakfast."}
{"text":"I have to say that I am incredibly underwhelmed with this place. For a restaurant that prides itself in vegetarian cuisine, I would say that the food I've had there is significantly below par. I've been to the Double Wide a couple of times for drinks (even though I avoid the South Side like the plague), but I recently stopped in for food after work on a Groupon. I was by myself, so I had to get a bunch of food to cover the $20 I got on my Groupon :). I started with the seitan wings, which were not cooked well at all. The flavors was great (I think I got the BBQ flavor), but it left a lot to be desired. If you want killer seitan wings, go to Spak Brothers on Penn in Lawrenceville! After the wings, I got a tofu dish with rice. Again, while the flavors and spices were tasty, the tofu wasn't cooked well at all. I know it's difficult to cook tofu well, but come on guys, you advertise yourselves as a vegetarian/friendly restaurant! More so, all of the food was sooooooo overpriced! The seitan wings to start were $10 for 10 wings. Next, the tofu dish was around 12 bucks. I think they jacked up the prices because they know most people are going there with Groupons. For food this bland and untasty, the bang was definitely not worth the buck. I will definitely not go to Double Wide for food again, and I can't recommend this place to vegetarians."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for spicy BBQ, this is your place.  The decor is more of a gas station (which was different but not necessarily a bad thing) with outdoor and indoor seating available.  The staff was very pleasant oir waitress was extremely honest when asked her feelings about certain items on the menu, which can be slightly overwhelming with the vast number of options.  The raspberry iced tea was tasty and there was a good variety of alcoholic beverages available.  I ordered the chicken, shroom & swiss and it was very good.  Two other options I was hoping for (salmon and turkey burger) were not available.  My wife got the brisket, which came with a dipping sauce that had a kick.  Without the sauce it was on the dryer side and was nothing spectacular.  We also ordered nachos with only cheese as an appetizer.  Some of the chips tasted burnt and the dish was rather dry, even with the cheese on top of it.  If we are in the area again, we would probably visit this place another time."}
{"text":"Large vegetarian-friendly menu; solid beer selection and atmosphere is good for groups and families.  Friendly and helpful staff!"}
{"text":"To start off, I am a pescetarian who is a vegetarian who still eats fish. I love trying new vegetarian and vegan places. This place has amazing vegetarian options as well as meals for meat eaters too. The bean nacho appetizer is one of my favorites. The vegetarian gyro is also to die for. However, the vegetarian \"wings\" are weird. Also made with seitan, they are just meatless cubes that can be seasoned well. Overall an amazing place to experience."}
{"text":"I've been to the annual fried tofu eating contest that they have, it was fun to watch and in the end I was glad I didn't particpate.  

I've also been for their tuesday all you can eat rib special.  I had a whole rack of ribs with their fries and it also came with corn bread.  Their ribs do melt in your mouth, I would say they're almost amazing.  My mouth is actually watering thinking about it.  and the special is only around 13 dollars which is a great deal for unlimited ribs.  

I'd like to return to try their other dishes sometime, its just a very down to earth establishment if you could call a restaurant that.  Their kitchen is open late as well till 1am i believe, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"We ate there last night. I do like the 'theme'. Place has tons of potential. Had the Tijuana rice balls and a burger. My son had the Cajun wings.

The place is just OK. The only thing I can say is that there is just a complete lack of enthusiasm about anything in that place, including the bar staff, the wait staff, the hostess and the food. All the reviews you read about this place are accurate. Blah!

Save your money."}
{"text":"Neat little niche kinda place. Parking sucks but it's Pittsburgh. Nachos were good but the Chili that stated no beans was more like a stew. Kinda disappointed :("}
{"text":"Man, I really want to like this place more than I do.  I love the decor and the vibe, but the food is lacking.  I just moved here from Austin, Texas and I'm a vegetarian.  I like that Double Wide has veggie options, but they just aren't very good.  I've been there mainly for brunch and I always get the Southwestern Tofu Wrap and I add guacamole.  To be fair, maybe I should just order something else, but this always sounds so good.  It just doesn't taste very good.  It lacks in flavor and the guacamole doesn't appear to be housemade.  It look like something you get in a bag.  Another note, the portion sizes are tiny.  Not just for that dish, but I've been with several other people for brunch and I look around at everyone's plates and there just isn't a lot of food there.  Like I said, I really want to dig it, but I think you need to step it up in the food department.  I'll keep trying it, but maybe next time I'll get the veggie burger."}
{"text":"This place is atrocious!  AVOID!

Visited on Feb 7, 2018 for lunch. The place was completely empty except for us for about 15 minutes. One other family arrived and believe it or not, they sat them in the booth right next to us!!! The entire place was EMPTY! WTF???

We immediately felt uncomfortable and discussed moving as soon as we received our food. It was too late, though, the mood was killed and we just wanted to leave, but we'd already ordered. 

I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak Soup and an order of two pieces of cornbread. Would have been nice for the waitress to tell me the soup came with cornbread so I didn't order the extra I didn't need. The soup was essentially partially coagulated fat with a few pieces of jalapeño added in. Since when do Philly Cheesesteaks have jalapeños???  I promptly regurgitated the slightly spicy gelatinous goo before even making it home. In fact, after about three spoonfuls, I almost redecorated the patio. 

One person ordered the chicken nuggets and a basket of fries. The nuggets were over cooked and dry and the fries looked like they'd been sealed in a plastic container after frying making them wet and soggy. 

Last meal we ordered was a sandwich that came piled with a stack of raw, cold jalapeños hidden under a layer of translucent cheese that looked like it had been melted three days ago. 

Just don't do it. AVOID!"}
{"text":"It was nice to sit outside. I went there on a blind date, and ended up have a great time.  I have the Rice balls which were delicious.  I don't really eat there, but the atmosphere was decent."}
{"text":"I ate here again recently. WHY Devin WHY must you do this to yourself? 
It was worse than I remember. The seitan is AWFUL. What did they do to it? I remember it being half palatable. 
Anyway, everyone that works there seems to be in a funk and miserable. They just shuffle around like corpses. This is by no means a vegetarian/vegan friendly restaurant. You'd think they hate vegan/vegheads by the way the serve that slop and call it food. My lord! 
I eat meat, but sometimes crave vegan options. This place is a no go. 
Go somewhere else, actually... leave the south side immediately and head over the bridge to society and decent meals. 
YEESH"}
{"text":"Love this place! A lot!
 I docked them a star for being out of particular beers on their list on 2 different days we were there.
Anyway, they have a very extensive menu and that includes vegan and vegetarian options. Lots of them. Like seitan wings, what? Oh yes. Awesome!
We were just visiting Pittsburgh for a week and went there twice. Sat outside. The service was prompt and efficient. Very knowledgeable about the vegan choices. 
I will go back in a heartbeat when I'm in town. In the meantime I will miss it terribly."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss with the food. I've stopped coming here because you just never really know if it will be amazing or terrible."}
{"text":"Rename it the Double wide disaster. If I could give zero stars I would. 7 of us ladies met today for lunch. I ordered the Grilled Salmon salad no onions, it has a choice of salt & pepper grilled or bbq glaze. The waitress didn't ask me my choice. I got salt & pepper grilled, I think my blood pressure went up with all the salt wow! And it came with diced onions I said I didn't want, sent it back they picked the out (I could have done that) missed a few because I can still taste them. Glad to know someone had their fingers in my food.  One lady ordered a tilapia sandwich, fries were cold, fish was spoiled sent it back. The other lady never received her food, a salad. They brought out 3 different salads to her all of which were not the correct one. She gave up on eating as we were almost finished. Waitress never checked back to see if we needed anything & plates were still on the table when we left. Not an enjoyable place for lunch at all"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this restaurant on many occasions and I am very glad I finally did! It was a beautiful day so many people were eating outside and the \"dog friendly\" section was a delight to see! Our food was fantastic (the nachos are crazy good) and the service was excellent. It was so good that we went back the next day for brunch. 
I am excited to have finally tried this gem and fully intend on going back on my next visit."}
{"text":"Double Wide Grill was okay. I had a platter with brisket and a 1/3 rack of pork ribs. The ribs were good, but I thought the sauce was too sweet. The brisket was extremely dry, and the sauces served with it didn't really help.

The platter came with french fries, which were okay, cole slaw that was unremarkable, and corn bread that I didn't eat because I'm on a gluten-free diet.  I shared a serving of wings, which I also thought were too sweet.  So nothing really wowed me, and the brisket was not good.  Total bill was around $25.

There are about twenty beers on tap.  Each item on the menu is marked if it is wheat-free, vegetarian, or vegan, and there are many options of each type; also a separate gluten-free menu which lists all the wheat-free options.  This was very useful, and I was grateful for it.

If I lived in the neighborhood, I might eat at the Double Wide a few times a year.  But I'm not in Pittsburgh much, and the food at the Double Wide was not wonderful enough to make this a place I would go out of my way to visit whenever I'm in town, so I think I'm not likely to go back."}
{"text":"Service was very good. Food was very bad. They had better take the jerk chicken off the menu before they get sued.  It's chopped up chicken legs in a weak jerk that has 0 heat.  Seriously these idiots used a dull cleaver and hacked up chicken legs.  Needless to say the dish was filled with sharp bone shards that made it very dangerous to eat.   Dumb dumb dumb and dumber."}
{"text":"This is another place I'm not quite sure how I went so long without reviewing. I always enjoy a trip to Double Wide when the weather is nice. Sitting outside on their patio drinking a Corona almost makes me feel like I'm at the beach. Whether you have a big group, or your only getting dinner or drinks for two, there's a seat for you on the patio. 

Double Wide's menu has a huge selection. And don't be turned off by the fact they specialize in BBQ if you're vegetarian. There's a full two pages of vegetarian option on the menu. Despite all these options though, many times when I'm there, I always end up turning back to my favorite meal, the Porky Pineapple Burrito. I love love love their pulled pork. If you do get a BBQ'd item, it's good to know that they serve their BBQ sauce on the side. I think this is nice because some people like their meat lightly sauced while others like a lot of sauce. But if you're expecting it to be all in one it can be a little different.

The service is friendly There have been times I've waited a little longer than normal for food, but when I'm sitting outside enjoy whatever I'm drinking I really don't mind so much. Certainly one of my go-to's on the Southside!"}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill. We are Never going back. If you want to enjoy you night out with a good meal go somewhere that cares about their customers. Service is awful! Second time of bad service there will not be a third"}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to going here for a while, but the place was always jam packed, so we opted to wait til the new restaurant smell wore off.  Well, I can tell you, it was not worth the wait.  It wasn't too busy, about half full on a weeknight.  Other reviewers said they service was lackluster, but now that time has went on, the staff seems pretty well trained, and our server was very good.  The food also came out very quickly.  That's about all I can say good about this place.

The food was very pricey.  I can see this flying down at their South Side location.  I don't mind paying for good food, but Irwin really isn't the place for an overpriced restaurant. The dinners are about $15-$20 on average with a very few being cheaper, and a few being a bit more.  Someone was taking me out here, so I didn't want to spend all of their money, so I opted to get a sandwich, which was still $11.  Also, half the stuff on the menu I wouldn't even want to try.  A lot of them had ingredients I just wouldn't like.  And I'm not that picky.  They just seem to want to use any and all things I'm opposed to.  Like I wanted to get the mac and cheese, but it was cauliflower mac and cheese as one option, or broccoli mac and cheese as the other.  No thank you.

Ok, so down to what I tried.  I got a pulled pork sandwich and fries.  The fries were terrible.  They were fresh cut, but were way too crispy.  Also, they were not even hot when I got them.  And I ate them first.  They also didn't pull off the bad parts of the potato when they cut them.  So I had a few black pieces on the fries.  Not very appetizing.  Next to the pulled pork sandwich.  They put the bbq sauce on the side, and if you try the sandwich without the sauce it's downright bland.  The sauce was a runny bbq sauce.  It was basically like water.  It tasted ok though.  It was pretty spicy, which I don't mind, but some people wouldn't like it, then they'd be stuck with a bland sandwich.  With the sauce, the sandwich was just ok, but the sandwich was also just lukewarm like the fries.  The only thing I liked about the whole meal was the onion bun they served it on.  

You're better off just going 10 minutes down the road to Smoky Bones.  You can get a whole bbq meal there that tastes good for under $15."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and had the same bad experience both times. The ambiance, food selection, and tastes are amazing. This should be a regular place for us, however, the service is terrible. The servers are not staffed properly. Our server last night, while very fiendly, was in waaaaay too many sections and had 4 parites of more than 6 people that we could see. Not one person at our table was offered a refill on their drinks. The people in my party eating the all you can eat ribs were only offered a second serving 30 minutes after they were done eating the first set. Their second set took an additonal 30 minutes to be delivered to the table.  At that point everyone was ready to go...but we couldn't leave because we were waiting for our checks.for what felt like an extra hour. I love a relaxing slow paced dinner, but 3 hours is waaaaaay toooo long. Both times I was there, I could not identify a manager on site. This place feels really unorganized. Despite the great food, we won't be back. It's not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I really like the double wide. That being said, it doesn't get 5 starts, because I have had some bad experiences there (plural). Their veg menu is awesome. The veg faux chicken wings are to-die-for! Most everything I have tried there was good, and their brunch has some interesting and delish veg options. 

That being said, I have had Turrible T-u-r-r-i-b-l-e service there more than once, and from different waiter/waitresses. They don't really seem to care if you need anything or want anything, and even when you ask, sometimes you don't get. I have also had food come out two shades gray of luke warm and then come back definitely microwaved, yet still delish...

Overall, if you have time to wait and tons of patience (or are drunk) go there, they have good food and beer. If you are in a bad mood or rushed, skip it."}
{"text":"I only ate here once and was sick immediately after. I mean walking through the parking lot I felt sick - that fast. I know lots of people who go here and like the food, maybe I just had a bad experience. Ordered the shrimp salad. My daughter was with me that day - also got sick stomach immediately. Sorry . I won't go back"}
{"text":"Lots of meat on the menu - ribs, BBQ,. I got the meatloaf - pretty good with lumpy garlic mashed potatoes- the strings beans were hard, I sent them back only to get the same beans back just hotter and tougher, the waitress couldn't fix it."}
{"text":"DONT GET THE RIBEYE.  Decided to try the special which has been posted on the outside of the restaurant for several  weeks which was the 12oz ribeye steak.  I don't think I've had anything  as bad steakwise since ponderosa closed.  The texture of the meat was spongy and there was so much gristle it was difficult to cut.  The only discernable flavor was a slight smokey taste.  It was truly terrible."}
{"text":"One of the few places in Pittsburgh where vegetarians and vegans aren't an afterthought. Look at the back of the menu for lots of great veggie and vegan options. And, they are especially tasty, not your run of the mill grilled veggies.

We tried the seitan wings, which were very good. Hubby had the grilled portobello reuben, which he thought was quite good. I had the grilled tofu with chimichurri sauce. Both were tasty options that we can't get elsewhere.

Very laid back atmosphere, probably great for groups, but also for those with children. We'll be back for the brunch."}
{"text":"Honestly the worst service I have had in Pittsburgh. Some McDonald's are better. No greeting, no water, then no refills. The food was cold and so uninteresting."}
{"text":"So I went in for lunch. They just started lunch this week. I got the lunch meatloaf with cornbread and onion rings. Everything was good, cooked good and the wait staff was excellent. Meatloaf and corn bread was home made. The onion rings were just frozen ones."}
{"text":"We were excited to see this Pittsburgh favorite closer to home but we left a bit disappointed.  Our service was fine, a bit slow, but knowing that they recently opened and it was a busy Saturday night we didn't let that bother us.  

The reuben appetizer rolls were good but rather expensive at $8 for 2. 
The tilapia tacos looked like someone just put some fish on a soft taco shell. Not terrible but something anyone could make for themselves at home. 
The burgers weren't bad but I not great either. I would have been just as happy down the road at Five Guys paying half the price. The sweet potato fries tasted good but were a little over done. Certainly not worth paying extra for.... although the other fry options that my friends got didn't look any better. 

I don't expect we'll be making a trip back."}
{"text":"I visited Double Wide for the first time today. My first impression was pretty good. The parking lot was packed but our party was seated very quickly and our drinks were brought to us in a timely manner. I decided on the French toast, which was described as two thick cut pieces of bread with a heavy egg batter. I also opted to add bananas and their homemade whip cream. I was really looking forward to my meal, especially after seeing it get served to the table next to us. It looked delicious! 

What I was served was 3 limp pieces of bread with barely any egg batter and 5 brown banana slices. Yes, I counted them. I asked the server about it and pointed out what should have been the proper dish at the table next to us and she told me that \"they ran out of the right bread after I put the order in\". Okay, that's fine, but it's not my fault. She didn't even offer an apology which is what frustrated me. She should have came out WHEN she found out and asked if I wanted to change my order, because I totally would have. It also wasn't even discounted or anything on our bill (in my opinion it should have been because I got crap compared to what the dish actually looked like).

Overall my first visit was very disappointing."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in the Southside. I love the food. The service is always amazing. The vegan and vegetarian items are clearly marked, and makes it easy to order. Prices are great. Awesome selection of beer. Try the bbq seitan on a wrap... with cheddar cheese. And shoestring fries. It makes my day."}
{"text":"The Double Wide Grill is a more interesting alternative than the other chain restaurants that are found on the eastern end of Carson St.  The old gas station ambiance is pretty fun as well.  The food seemed pretty mediocre to me, however the prices were quite reasonable.  I had the potato tacos which tasted like they were filled with overseasoned Potato Flakes like you'd get under turkey in a really bad cafeteria.  Maybe it was my fault for ordering such a weird dish in the first place.  The other plates served at my table seemed much better.  The service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Now I know why...
why I wouldn't stand in a doorway waiting to be acknowledged
Why I wouldn't sit at a table...surrounded by tables...set with napkins
Waiting for a menu...for a look from the waitstaff...
oh wait we don't have. To sit through the torture!!! Of believing you serve food past 9 pm like your website directs!!
Of hoping for service that I am more than happy to pay for...
But oh well..I guess four parties of less than four can b hard when
You're twirling your hair...
Thanks for the worst service and u didn't even know I wanted food...no attempt in 20 minutes ...to even bring us a beer...
Now I know ...why its way more rewarding to go 50 ft and
eat half price apps with awesome sevice...talking the I've-been-out-to
Eat-at-least-once-before kind of at functional food
carriage with charisma...as if the library has always been an eatery."}
{"text":"First visit here I was really looking forward to it but the menu sucks.. We got seat quick got our drinks but haven't seen out waitress in 45 min.. Got a salad and they messed that up wow!! Not a recomend!!"}
{"text":"I had a dismal dining experience last night. Went for the all you can eat rib night. We arrived at 7:00, and were informed that the kitchen closes at 9. Normally that would be more than enough time. We didn't get our first plate until 7:45. We sat for another 30 minutes with empty plates and glasses. Iced tea was warm with a couple of ice cubes. Had to ask for more ice. Second plate shows up, that was fine. Third plate showed up ice cold, we got our check and left. Not going back."}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets a star is because I liked their sauces. 

This place seemed really dirty. There was a section to bring your dogs. Thanks for the ticks. 

THE SERVICE SUCKS! We were there for 25 minutes before getting our drinks. Then after we sat down, another couple was seated and ordered after us and got their appetizer and meal before we got our appetizer. The waitress seemed to be zeroed out, so that's what she got on the tip section of the check, a big ZERO. Just because your waiting on me doesn't mean I have to tip you. Tipping comes from being satisfied with your experience. Sorry but I'm not sorry. Definitely won't be back. Seemed kinda trashy."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place... I have to say my first experience fell way short of that. On the night I was in with some friends it happened to be karaoke night. The music was so loud I couldn't carry on a conversation at the table. 
The service was okay to fair... it didn't stand out good or bad.
The food was either really good (In the case of the Cuban Sandwich) or GOD AWFUL (In the case of what passes for cornbread) overall not the worst experience but far from the best."}
{"text":"This place is great for vegans and omnivores. They have a vegan/vegetarian menu with plenty of options for all. My favorite are the seitan wings with vegan BBQ sauce. I get them every time I go. I have tried a few of the other vegan dishes and liked them all but my go-to is still the seitan wings. 

The service is slow but staff are friendly. Gets loud during peak hours and when there is a big sports game on. Parking in this area of South Side isn't too bad either."}
{"text":"The best thing about Double Wide is the outdoor seating and the cute servers.  They have a decent selection of beers too, but the food wasn't that impressive.  I only got a burger with onion rings, but my dining companions weren't super thrilled with the food either.  

It's decently priced though and good for groups, but the meats in the burgers weren't very flavorful nor was the onion rings I got or the soggy fries that T9 got.  They did have a lot of vegetarian and vegan options though for those non-meat eaters."}
{"text":"Been here several times always ordered off the grill. My ribs have always been so tender the bone slides right out. Corn bread is also really sweet I love it. Plenty of craft beers and huge patio. Only gripe is service can often be a little slow. Kitchen open till 1 Friday and saturday."}
{"text":"A gem. This is one of the strangest restaurants of all time. I felt like I was hanging out on the set of Trailer Park Boys (they commit to the theme hardcore), yet they offer an impressive array of vegan and gluten free options. It's quite the juxtaposition. They have gluten free bread and buns, and they even have a gluten free / vegan dessert that was killer. They call it a Goo Ball, and it consists of honey, oats, crisp rice, flax seed, and peanut butter. This place was so unique and satisfying... I just couldn't resist leaving a review."}
{"text":"Great time.   Good food, nice beer selection and funky atmosphere.  We were there for a large (20 people) birthday party.  Kia was a fantastic waitress!  Very attentive.  I'll go back next time in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I frickin' love this place.  Get on their birthday mailing list and get a free birthday meal.

You MUST try the vegan Seitan buffalo wings! We end up getting them every time because they're incredible.  We love buffalo sauce or the sauce that has some dude's name in it.  Get them with ranch or blue cheese, your choice.

My favorite thing to get here is the TV dinner.  I love sampling all the different items.  From ordering this I discovered how much I like their Coconut Mango Tofu!  

My partner loves their housemade lentil burger.  Other sandwiches we've gotten here have just been 'okay'.  

Vegans go nuts for this place, and they should.  Street parking is usually around, sometimes you're going to have to pay for it depending on the hour/day, so make sure you check the meters where you're at."}
{"text":"I got a Billy bob burger and it was fantastic.  Everything was seasoned wonderfully and nothing was overdone.  My only complaint about it was that they did not ask me how I wanted my burger cooked but it came out good.  Fantastic fries too.

They also have an extensive vegetarian and vegan menu that all looked fairly good."}
{"text":"We went to Double Wide because We had a coworker with us who needs Gluten Free options. They have a separate menu for GF options which made it really easy for her, with no guess work needed. We were in Pittsburgh for 3 nights and we ate at Double Wide for 2 of those nights because the options were so vast. I had a chicken salad the first night which was massive, and the cajun tilapia the second night. My coworker had the meatloaf which he thought was amazing! A good option for those looking for healthier dinners."}
{"text":"The lentil burger was bland and didn't come with any toppings. Usually, a burger would come with lettuce, tomato, some kind of ketchup mustard or sauce...not this one. The vegan wings were square chunks of seitan that had a great taste but not for the price especially since seitan is literally flour and water. Overpriced and underwhelming."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place  I love all the clearly marked vegan/vegetarian options on the menu. I had both the vegan Gyro and the Vegan cheese steak sandwich and both were great! Very tasteful and delicious. Our service was great both times we were there this week and their blended margarita was bomb.com 
10 outa 10, would recommend"}
{"text":"I have been to the Double Wide a few times.  It really is hot or miss.  I have loved the ribs at times and sometimes deemed them barely adequate.  Their wings are solid.  Peanut butter pie is also tasty.  They have a descent beer selection.  They are a textbook 3 star."}
{"text":"I came here a number of times years ago and recently returned for dinner on a Wednesday night. It seems that they have expanded the menu over the past few years and one good thing is that they have a TON of vegetarian/vegan options. 

The atmosphere is nice. There is ample opportunity for good people watching and the outside area is shaded and breezy for when you want to sit outside on a hot day. They also have a separated dog patio which is a nice accommodation for those with dogs and for those who would rather not sit next to a dog while eating. 

Our waitress was attentive but not overly personable -- which is totally fine by me. I had the hawaiian burger with fries. The food was fine but not memorable. The sandwiches and burgers seemed fairly priced but the entrees looked over priced to me. 

I'd come back if someone invited me but probably wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Surprised about all of the bad reviews here i thought the food was good and just the fact that it is on carson st in such a cool setting a convered car garage with a full size car.above the bar i enjoyed my experience here."}
{"text":"Decent food--they have a nice selection of vegetarian options.

A little pricey for what they serve though."}
{"text":"If you order the AYCE BBQ ribs or just BBQ ribs in general ask for the tender pieces. We did the AYCE ribs, the first plates were good, the 2nd plates were hard, and the third was ooh so good and tender. I loved the good ribs and I've had a lot of them from all over and its also a very good deal.

They charge extra for sauce for the ribs however if they give you the tender pieces no extra sauce is needed.

I like this place lots of outdoor and indoor seating and they have a garage theme. It's was very busy when we were there but they have lots of room for everyone. They also have couches which if you don't mine eating on a couch is just like eating at home cause they have tv all over the place.  It's also the perfect place to watch the game."}
{"text":"I have waited to rate this place, we have been here about 10 times now. I feel we have given them plenty of opportunity and the food just is not very good. The nachos were kinda good in the beginning but the last few times they have been burnt to the point of not being edible.. the only thing that you could say is good is the cornbread.. we won't be back.. 
this is just a side note.. the t-shirts that they sell of the 3 legged dog is in very poor taste.."}
{"text":"Torn

The staff, burger, brunch, and atmosphere is really great.

Unfortunately the BBQ they tout is absolutely horrible... The TV dinner gimmick is great, but the food arrived cold and the brisket was downright bland ... 

If you want a great burger or brunch this is a great place and they even have a section for canine friends, but I can't stress how bad the BBQ is 

I'll be back for lunch all the time... But dinner... Just avoid"}
{"text":"Bar none, Double Wide Grill is the best place to spend a summer night in Pittsburgh. The restaurant is housed in a converted gas station, and its former parking lot is now covered with picnic tables. Globe lights twinkle overhead and a corn hole pit beckons patrons from the corner of the outdoor seating area. There's no bad seat on the patio, with gorgeous public art murals bookending the restaurant and a parade of Carson Street humanity constantly marching by. 

Because it is housed in a converted gas station, Double Wide has adopted a white trash theme. (Hence the 'Double Wide' moniker.) Customers can order a six-pack of beer delivered to their table in a cooler, or a custom-made TV dinner on a tray. As a recent Tennessee transplant I am constantly on the lookout for good barbecue, and Double Wide has that as well. Although not up to Knoxville standards, my pulled pork platter was juicy and tender, and the cornbread was incredibly sweet and delicious. I do, however, take issue with the restaurant's coleslaw, which isn't the creamy, homestyle mixture that I adore, but a bizarre tangy concoction full of cherries. Cherries? Seriously? If Double Wide truly wants to make a name as an arbiter of great southern fare, they will have to remedy the coleslaw situation.

That having been said, pretty much everything I've ordered at the restaurant has been excellent. This includes crab, black bean and corn fritters, a portabella mushroom stuffed with spinach and brie, the barbecue chicken ranch salad, and several types of tacos. Surprisingly a full page of the menu is devoted to vegetarian and vegan options, so something is truly available to satisfy every member of your group. And that includes canines! Not only is Double Wide's patio dog friendly, but they boast an entire menu devoted to the beasts. My pup, Radar, loves coming to Double Wide, where he plays in the mulch around the shrubbery, receives tons of love and attention, and gets to eat a piece of grilled chicken or beef made just for him! 

Sitting outside on a warm summer night, drinking with your friends and watching the city move past is one of the best feelings in the world, and in Pittsburgh, Double Wide Grill is the place to do it."}
{"text":"I work on the South Side and I've been really curious about this place.  And I've had a BBQ craving lately.  So, despite the poor reviews about the service and food that my coworkers had given me, I decided to try it out.  I ordered a BBQ combo of brisket and ribs.  It was awful.  The brisket was chopped instead of sliced and it was lying in a pile under a quarter rack of ribs.  The brisket was dry as a desert with no sauce served at all, not even on the side.  And this dried up meat desperately needed sauce.  It had no flavor and no spice.  Icky!  The ribs looks good, but they were served as a quarter rack and the knife I had was just a dinner knife and would not cut through the ribs so I could separate them.  They had a little more flavor with some kind of slightly sweet sauce brushed on the outside.  But the best I could do was scrape a little meat off the bone. I took the ribs back to work and gave them to the office food scavenger.  If figured if he could find a way to cut them apart, more power to him.  

The service was actually pretty good.  But that's not enough to get me back into this place.  I'm sure there's better BBQ somewhere in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great place for loud, relaxed times.  Food is what you would expect from a converted garage, we love it - bring your dog."}
{"text":"The pulled porky sandwich and fries ever very good. I would recommend this sandwich if you like sweet BBQ. The outdoor seating was lovely and the waiter was attentive"}
{"text":"The toddler and I stopped here for lunch on a Monday. The decor immediately made the toddler happy with old trucks, car parts, fuel pumps and other garage knic knacs.  The host was not friendly and rushed to the table way ahead of us. He also gave me a drink menu which was weird considering I'm 38 weeks prego. He never spoke, even when I tried to engage. Hopefully it was a bad day for him and he wasn't meaning to be so rude.
Our server rocked however. She was on top of everything. I had a bbq pulled seitain with cornbread. The sauce was sweet and spicy. The toddler had some Kraft Mac n cheese with some delicious fries. His meal also included a scoop of ice cream. Besides the Donnie Downer host, this place rocked!"}
{"text":"Only been here once, and I would have given it two stars if not to give it the benefit of the doubt that the restaurant was in recovery-mode from Saint Patrick's day weekend. We went on a Sunday night, and we had difficulty placing an order because they were out of a lot of menu items/beers.

The hot seitan wings were pretty good, I liked that they actually had some kick to them and enough sauce to make them satisfyingly moist. The whole order though was pretty pricey for the small portion size, especially compared to seitan wings offered elsewhere in Pittsburgh (OTB, Spak bros, etc), and the wing sizes were really mis-proportioned which made splitting the order as an appetizer awkward.

They were out of vegan rolls for burgers, but I was craving a one, so I ordered the vegan lentil burger anyway on the multigrain bread. When it arrived, it had no toppings (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle) so I had to call back the waitress to ask for them and for some mustard. The lentil patty was good, but the meal tasted like a sandwich rather than a burger. The vegetable side of zucchini and squash was pretty watery and mild, though not terrible, I regretted not ordering a different side.

I'd be willing to give this place another try, since I've heard the veggyro and vegan fries are good!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the most disgusting places I have ever eaten!! The place was filthy and the terrible food was way overpriced! How does this place stay in business??"}
{"text":"This place has great burgers and salads. I especially enjoy that you can get a burger with a side of vegetables - a rarity in this town. The only downer? The new remodel that changed the interior from a cozy, quirky place to an ugly sports bar complete with way too many big screen tv's."}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant 4 times in 6 weeks.  The first time was lunch and I had crispy wings and my friend had nachos.  We both loved our food and were treated royally.  We did the same experience 2 days later.,  I've had dinner twice with my son and grandchildren.  The first trip, they brought my wings drenched in sauce, when I asked for sauce on the side.  The manager insisted on making this right, bringing me another order or unsauced wings and letting me keep the sauced wings to take home.  She further adjusted the bill, which I did NOT request, nor did I make a fuss about the wrong type or wings.  My son enjoyed his chipolte meatloaf dinner.   Server was tipped $20.00

Noo, let's visit last night's experience.  We asked for unsweetened iced tea, waited at least 10 minutes for it, and it came sweetened.  I added sweetener without tasting, so the tea was undrinkable.  It was an additional 10 minutes before we caught our server's eye to ask for different tea.  We had not been offered water.  It was a full 25 minutes before we got our food.  I had wings with sauce.  They were very dry.  My son said the chili was flavorless with little meat, and he took one bite and set it aside.  I set my empty glass to the edge of the table and had to stop eating until I got tea ( full ten minutes) because the sauce was hot.  Son and grandson ordered dessert and I was still eating wings.  My empty glass was sitting there, and she never offered a refill until I finally asked her to bring me more tea.  She got an $8.00 tip.  Miserable meal experience.

Never again.  This place just keeps getting worse."}
{"text":"This may have had the BEST onion rings I've ever eaten. Not heavily battered like most places and definitely not frozen. They were crispy and hot and I wish I had ordered two baskets for myself instead of sharing one. 

The corn bread was delicious as well. You could tell it was made with actual corn and not just from a box.

My meal was just ok. I ordered the bbq brisket.  I wasn't feeling the bbq sauce (too sweet) and my meat was a little dry. All was forgiven though since they did provide me with those delicious onion rings.

I could sit here and drink beer after beer from their fairly extensive beer menu and just eat onion rings and corn bread. In fact if I'm ever back here, I might have to do just that."}
{"text":"Great causal place for vegetarians and vegans.   Veggygyro was tasty with right amount of spice.   Coleslaw with cherries was different and very good,   Fabulous staff especially Kea (Kia?).  Attentive. Made sure all orders were right.  Very personable and knowledgeable about the foods.   Efficient, pleasant service.   Good choices of beers."}
{"text":"Food tasted ok but was cold.  Our waitress didn't  even ask how the food was,  so we told her it was cold and and like rubber.   Manager took care of the meal.   Unlikely to return.  A little pricey and not great quality"}
{"text":"Our Birthday lunch will be remembered for the long wait to get seated and the twice as long wait (1hr) to get our order and it was not all brought to the table at one time. The first served were done eating by the time the last 2 people in our party were served. Poor management. We had to ask for drink refills while we waited. Maybe they need to hire more waitresses/waiters. We couldn't understand why tables seated after us were served and gone by the time we got our meals. The burgers were okay but the French fries were soggy."}
{"text":"Vegetarian or not, you have to come here for the seitan wings. They're fantastic. My entire family (two young kids, included) loves them. The wait staff is also incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure how you can tell someone to their face that there are no seats available when half the restaurant has open seats. And also tell them that service will be ending shortly. (And service is scheduled to end in 40 minutes?)

2 stars for beer.
No stars for douche-baggery."}
{"text":"While in general I am not the biggest fan of the venues in the South Side this one is a nice spot to hang out and have some drinks and a grab.  There is a lot of outdoor sitting, which makes it ideal for the summer time.  The service was fast and helpful. The drinks were solid and the food even better! Two of us order the pulled pork sandwich and it was as good as it gets, while their vegetarian selection is huge and great (based on the vegetarians of our group).  All in all, I think it is worth a try if you have not visited the place and I am sure you will like it.  Only negative point, is that they could use some more care in the facility - it looks dirty and old (which of course does not necessarily mean that it is, but it could use some more care)."}
{"text":"I came here with my family, as it was one of the few places we could find that catered to both carnivores and vegans.

Our server - let's call him Alex - was a little odd.  First he introduced himself and took our drink orders.  He came back with our drinks a few minutes later and asked us if we were ready to order.  We were ready to order, but before waiting for our answer he turned to my father and started talking to him about the baseball game playing on the television.  My parents don't speak very good English and it was obvious that my father wasn't able to follow what Alex was saying.  Alex seemed to suddenly realize this, and then inexplicably walked away without saying anything.  We were confused, to say the least.  

He came back ten minutes later and introduced himself...again.  He took our orders.  I ordered the full order of seitan wings with vegan barbecue sauce with some vegan shoestring fries.  My brother ordered a sandwich.  My parents ordered something or other - I can't remember.  A while later, he appeared with our food.  He put down a small plate of cubed seitan in front of me.  He then asked, \"You ordered the half order right?\"  I said no, I ordered the full order.  He said, \"Crap, I'll be right back with your full order.\"  

He came back shortly with a second plate.  I noticed that everyone but me had a little plastic cup filled with sauce.  There was a pitiful amount of drizzled hot sauce on my seitan blocks.  I reminded Alex that I had ordered barbecue sauce and asked him to bring me a cup of it.  He said, \"No, you ordered hot sauce.  I KNOW you ordered hot sauce.  I would have remembered if you ordered barbecue sauce.  Do you want to add barbecue sauce as well?\"  I insisted that no, I'd ordered barbecue sauce and he insisted that no, I hadn't, I'd ordered hot sauce.  I didn't want to ruin what was supposed to be a pleasant evening out with my family so I let it go.  I was extremely annoyed.  Borderline furious.

He came back later on to check on us and asked us where we were from.  We could see that he had no idea that it existed, nor that he cared.  He said, \"Oh, I was wondering why you didn't understand the baseball thing,\" and then immediately left again at a half-trot.  Soooooo weird.

My brother noticed that his \"sandwich\" lacked a piece of bread.  Last I heard, two slices of bread are the required criteria for a sandwich.  My family members' meals were so-so.  My vegan seitan wings were actually really good and tasted exactly how I remembered chicken wings to taste like.  However, the hot sauce which I hadn't ordered or wanted gave me an upset stomach.  I was definitely peeved.

The atmosphere was great.  You can eat outside or inside.  It was too humid to eat outside so we chose inside.  It's set up like an old mechanic's shop, which I'm assuming it used to be.  Real cool set up.  There's only one huge TV instead of a thousand small ones, and normally with a more professional/attentive server and food served the way I'd ordered it, I'm sure I would have had a great time.

I wouldn't really recommend this place if you have other options available.  We all left dissatisfied with the food and service."}
{"text":"I've been here for the regular lunch/dinner menu and it's been good every time. The brunch, however, is out if this world. I've been meaning to try it for awhile, but an about-to-expire Groupon finally got me there early on a Sunday. I've heard great things about the brunch but was also told he can get busy and crowded so I made sure to be there when they opened at 10am. Definitely worth the wait. 

It was a tough decision, but I rightly chose the beef chili omelet. It will definitely get me back. The menu has tons of options, including several vegetarian choices.  Service was also good and friendly."}
{"text":"Lots of outdoor seating and huge portions of BBQ!

I would recommend the reuben egg rolls with the thousand island dip. These we're surprisingly good and its not too heavy of an appetizer. You'll have plenty of room for your entree!

Go for their tv dinner combos and you'll have plenty of food and a good variety! I especially liked their cornbread! Yum!

Be careful as usually the weekend crowd rolls through and depletes their beer selection so you should try getting here later in the week. There were a couple of beers I wanted to try but they were all out on a Monday. 

I would come back here for their bbq and drinks! Just was annoyed by all the bugs while I was sitting outside."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? I seriously don't know why I keep going back here. I want to rave about the food because their menu is interesting, but everything I've ever had has just been okay. The servers have always come off as somewhat rude. On numerous occasions, I've had to wait when there are plenty of open tables as they are always understaffed. As everyone has already pointed out, their outdoor seating is great, but if you come at a busy time, be prepared to wait for it.

Their prices aren't outrageously bad, but you can get much, much better for your money elsewhere in Southside. Bottom line, unless you're from out of town and want this experience, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food and service were just okay -- kind of meh. I ordered the vegetarian chili and I needed to ask for Tabasco sauce -- there was no spicing and the vegetables were somewhat raw. The wife ordered a sandwich and said it was fine. The kids had pizzas and again they were nothing to write home about. Not a great place especially when the service and food are sub par."}
{"text":"Haven't had anything I didn't like off the menu. Go to is the TV dinner. Best draft beer selection in the area! 40+ taps with lots of local stuff too. Perfect place to watch any sports game. Tv's everywhere at the bar."}
{"text":"They have lots of vegetarian options here and in my humble opinion, have the best seitan wings anywhere. Good variety of beers on tap as well."}
{"text":"I had alot of trouble using the Groupon here. First they weren't going to let me use it because they failed to tell me that you can't use it on happy hour appetizer purchases, meanwhile I told the waitress we had a Groupon before we ordered. 
Then they decided we were not able to use the groupon because the manager said they needed me to pull it up on my phone because they have to click used when you reedem it. (I have never had anywhere tell me that before and I have used many, many groupons). I had printed it out since Groupon states you may print the Groupon and use it and I was out of data. Well, apparently that rule does not apply here.
On top of that, the Seitan was not good... at all. My burger was also terrible. The nachos were the only thing I would order again.
So all in all we had a pricey and disappointing meal and a leftover Groupon I'm probably never going to use."}
{"text":"I love the outdoor seating, and I especially like the brunches.  I also think their specials, such as their \"all you can eat ribs,\" are a very good deal.  The food is pretty good, the people watching is excellent.  The Gingerbread Pancakes are excellent.  The service varies, but I generally get pretty good service at the Double Wide.  It's a fun place to go eat, almost everything is down home."}
{"text":"I am a total fan of this place.  To be honest the best time to go is happy hour!  Their boneless wings are half off and they are hands down amazing. Most days I can't get past them on the menu. My next favorite dish which I have had numerous times is the double wide salad with blackened chicken.  The chicken has tons of flavor and is always juicy!  

On top of the great food the beer selection is always awesome too. There is always something good no matter what ur beer preference is :)"}
{"text":"Always am happy with DWG's veg options! Have been there recently for brunch and lunch. Thank you for great, quick service and good food!"}
{"text":"I was seated outside with a cigar. I just wanted a beer. Later I was treated very rudely because the hostess didn't realize I had a cigar and was told to move. The food here is not good at all. Also, if you are white DO NOT come here with black people and order food."}
{"text":"Good bar for a lively crowd and a decent beer selection.  I didn't try the food, so I can only judge the place strictly on liquid refreshments and the bar area. 

Friendly service and very accommodating...just wish they offered a beer special or two.

That said, it's a fun, colorful atmosphere with plenty of easily visible TVs to take in a sporting event. 

I'll definitely return.  Until then...cheers!"}
{"text":"Updating previous review food was good. Server was great glad we came back.  Everything was exactly as ordered."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday around 1:15 PM.  Brunch menu was given to us.  We Since we already had breakfast, we asked for a lunch menu.  No problem -- got the lunch menu but was told certain things were not available yet (lunch doesn't start until 2:00 PM); i.e., brisket, and other items that still needed to roast.  Ok.  There were 4 of us.  One wanted chicken tenders but was told they are only served to children under 10!  Ok then.  Someone else ordered the buffalo chicken dip and chips.  Got about a handful of chips; and when asked for more was told they would be charged for another entire order.  Ok..............  Waitress was more than unemotional -- cold -- and unfriendly.  I would say, food is good; but it's best to go later in the day."}
{"text":"Had the tv dinner and loved it. Tried the coconut rum tilapia and it was on point. I will have to go back for the brisket after 5pm since they slow roast it all day. I enjoyed the alcohol beverages and the service was great. Costco has gift cards so you can get more bang for your buck. I saw mixed reviews on this place but I'm glad I tried it. I really enjoyed it and look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Food was terrible and service was worse... Also, not very sanitary as we had 5 flies flying around us, the food, and other people. Going outside wasn't any better, as there was a HUGE cricket that followed me, or maybe he just had it with the place too and walked out... Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Rude when we ask how long for a party of 13. She laugh and said when today???. I answered we called earlier  and were told you didn't take rsvp, and she said we dont, so i said then yes today why would you ask me today then??? Very rude not accommodating."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to go out for dinner on Memorial Day and decided to take a drive to Southside to see what was open. After driving past tons of closed bars, we saw that Double Wide was open and decided to check it out. We weren't super impressed last time we visited, but figured we would give them another chance.

There was one hostess working and we were told it would be 10 minutes. I was super hungry and therefore didn't stray too far away from the hostess stand, in order to be able to best hear our name, as soon as our table was ready. Their system did not make sense to me at all. There were a decent amount of empty tables, but it appeared they didn't have enough bussers to clean them quick enough. Waiting 10 minutes is not a big deal at all- it is just frustrating, when there are open tables the entire time and no one there to clean them. 

We were sat on the patio, which I was happy about (their patio is pretty awesome). Our server was friendly and attentive to our table the entire time. I decided on the California salad- which was described as a bed of romaine/iceberg mix with half an avocado, grilled portabellas, grapes, sunflower seeds, sprouts and grape tomatoes. The menu suggested their cilantro lime vinaigrette, so that is what I chose. It also came with one single piece of cornbread. My boyfriend ordered their Hawaiian burger- which appeared to be packed with flavor, according to the menu and photo. My salad ended up being made of entirely iceberg lettuce, which was really disappointing. The grilled portabellas were odd and were marinated in some type of balsamic, which really didn't compliment the cilantro lime vinaigrette. The best part of the salad was the grapes and the cornbread.. which isn't saying much. My boyfriend was disappointed in his burger as well. Although it was rather large, it was tasteless. 

Although their location and patio is ideal for Southside, the food is tasteless and just overall disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is kinda becoming a make-shift reunion spot with my friends every time I visit Pittsburgh. It satisfies (well, more than satisfies) everyone from the hardcore carnivores, broccoli chomping vegetarians, grass fed bisons and vegans such as myself.

I got the \"Vegyro\" (sounds so sexual) the last time I stopped in topped off with some tangy Margaritas... really good! Our waitress was cool as hell!

(Can't remember her name :/ but... it was Friday night, March 22, 2013 about 7:30pm, back corner booth. 5 adults and one bad-ass baby boy!)  Ehem... management,.. she should be commended / given a monetary prize if you can figure out who it was.

The whole back side of the menu is for vegans... this place is in \"french-fries-and-fried-eggs-on-everything-pierogi-happy\" Pittsburgh?! 

Terrific beer selections, really friendly staff, and a comfortable atmosphere in my favorite section of town, South Side.

Why 4/5 stars? I'm strictly basing it on deliciousness I've had every time I've been in there. Not over the top \"You SOOO need to go!\", but definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Brought a team out for the Tuesday rib special. Long wait and once the guys ate their first round of ribs (after waiting an hour), the waitress said it would be a longer wait for the next round. That and a rib eye steak that was paper thin did not make it a good experience."}
{"text":"Ribs, brisket, corn bread was amazing.   No reservation we were seated within 15 minutes.   Parking can be a challenge as the lot was full when we got there."}
{"text":"Today was our first time at DW. It took 3 different servers to tell the hostess we were at the door. Service from there was fine. Food took 40 minutes to receive and was barely passable. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm knocking this down to four stars is because of the length of time it took for the food to come out.  

I'm told this place has been dressed down considerably, but if you like old auto body themes, maybe it's for you.  The place was absolutely packed for the Saturday lunchtime rush, but a table was free after a few minutes.  The waitress took our drink orders, returning promptly with a raspberry iced tea that \"looked lighter than usual\" and recommending a taste test to make sure it was ok.  It was.  

I didn't find anything on the menu noting the availability of gluten-free sandwich buns, but it turns out they have both buns and bread!  The waitress didn't have a clue what gluten-free was, and admitted it was the first time anyone had asked her about it (probably because it's not on the menu?).  After something like a 40 minute wait, a salmon avocado sandwich arrived that was really good, on one of the better gluten-free buns I've had.  The French fries were just ok, nothing to go wild about.  

For this style of burger joint, they do a pretty good job.  They just need to work on the wait time for food during a rush."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed at the double wide Grill. I have given up eating red meat and pork. Still they have a great selection of fish dishes. I had to dry rubbed Mahi Mahi. 
They also have an excellent selection of vegetarian dishes."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at Double Wide. This place really shines in the summer, as there is outdoor seating with a great atmosphere. I've been here for brunch as well as lunch/dinner.

Recommendations: 

Brunch -- DOUBLE WIDE BENEDICT. Quite possibly one of my favorite brunch dishes ever. Sweet, savory, DELICIOUS! A must try!

Lunch/ Dinner -- BBQ Pulled Porky - A great pulled pork sandwich, melt in your mouth good!

I've always thought that the prices here are a little high, but the food is good so if you have some extra cash to shell out, put this on your list of things to visit in the southside"}
{"text":"Never disappointed with Double Wide. Food is delicious. Beer selection is plentiful. Service is good. It gets a bit crowded here during their busy hours. I guess you just have to time it right. I love going for Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner. Hell, I guess I just love going."}
{"text":"Double Wide Grill is the kind of place you want to be good, but never is. The only reason I am giving them two stars is because I have had experiences where the food was good (Brunch, Seitan Wings, various awesome vegetarian items that are available), however, more than often to the food is not great. I love the huge out door seating and the fact that there are so many great healthy but still enticing options to choose from on the menu, yet I only really enjoy the food probably half the time.

One thing you can count on being awful is the service. Waiting forever for a table, getting to a table and waiting forever to have someone come serve you, bad attitudes and bad service are all regular occurrences at Double Wide. I think I am a pretty low maintenance customer, and I certainly can be patient and understanding. Yet I have given Double Wide so many chances and am usually disappointed or offended. I would much rather go to OTB or Library, which both have way better food and are a block away."}
{"text":"Who knew such a place that just screams \"huge baskets of wings and double burgers\" would be so vegetarian friendly? Around my 21st birthday I had a hard time finding a mojito, so we stopped in here and got appetizers. Junk yard nachos and crab, black bean, and corn fritters were fantastic. I also discovered that mojito's aren't as good as they sound, but atleast they used real mint leaves!"}
{"text":"DONT EAT HERE. Unless you like waiting for HOURS to eat when the establishment is empty and staffed. Oh and if you want to deal with people who obviously don't like their job. Let me start by saying I only came here because the person I was with wanted to eat here for a couple months now. We approach the host stand only to see a miserable looking straight faced girl say \"there's a wait it will be 35 minutes\" ok no big deal we grabbed a seat. It's 5pm on a Sunday, Pens just won. Apparently this is what a \"35 minute wait\" looks like (see pics) Empty tables everywhere. Hostesses waiters and waitresses just standing around gossiping. That 35 minute wait quickly turned into a 45 minute wait. As we're waiting at a table we can hear people approach the host stand and the hostess girl is telling them there's a 45 minute wait, they can't sit and wait at a table but they can sit and wait at the bar. THE WHOLE PLACE IS EMPTY WHY CANT THEY SIT AT A TABLE???? Ok long story short by the time we're asked what we'd like to order 45 minutes have gone by, by the time we get our food we were sitting down long over 2 hours waiting. It took everything not to just get up and leave but the person I was with really wanted to try it out. He wasn't happy about the service whatsoever. Just not a good way to run a restaurant. Atrocious. Horribly run business and poorly managed, if there was a manager there tonight they should be reassessed."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars, but their soda is weird and some off brand that tastes like crap and the hostess with the bad perm and blue eyeshadow is incredibly rude. So sorry to disrupt your important text conversation and make it so that you actually had to seat someone. That being said, the food is amazing. The seitan wings are the best that I've ever had, the potato tacos are delicious and the BBQ pulled seitan is soooo good. I will definitely be back the next time that I am in town!"}
{"text":"I love the hip atmosphere and food. it's a cool place to hang out in the summer. You get to eat outside in the parking lot and there are always cool people there in the evenings.
The waiters dress in mechanic clothes with their name patch on their shirt and look like hicks."}
{"text":"I probably would have never chosen to go to this place as a new resident of Pittsburgh but when I saw it on Groupon and read the reviews stating that it had a good vegetarian selection, I thought I would give it a try. 

The aesthetic of this place is like a sports bar with decor such as beer bottles made into lamp covers and hubcaps all over the roof, but the vegetarian cuisine was as dead on as some run down hipster vegetarian joint. The seitan wings with parmesan garlic sauce were incredibly delicious. My girlfriend had this coconut fried tofu dish that had great potato sides that was pretty tasty as well. I personally had this dish called a potato taco. This was quite a unique and delicious dish.

All in all, the seitan wings were definitely the highlight and I would go back for that alone. The bar seems to have a good beer selection so this is probably a good place to take beer snob friends. Also looks like they have a good creative mixed drink selection that I would be interested in tapping into next time. I recommend."}
{"text":"I was here when the owner of the establishment showed up.  I got better service then.   Not a tribute to what usually happens."}
{"text":"Hmmm OK, I've been wanting to try their brunch for a very long time..so perhaps I built up my expectations...I'll start with that....

I started off with a bellini, and was very confused when it came out with a red color to it and a cherry at the bottom. It seemed like a rose/fruit wine, not peach purée and sparkling wine. I was willing to look past it and enjoy the brunch with a friend that I had not seen in awhile, except one of the waitresses kept yelling all over the restaurant to the rest of the staff. She was not yelling in a mean way, but in a conversation way, but she was the ONLY one yelling, why not walk up to the people...she made the whole restaurant comfortable with her very loud talking. 

Now on to my, Double Wide Benedict. I had such high expectations for this..but after the first bite I knew I made the wrong choice. The corn bread, bacon and eggs complimented each other so well, but as soon as the spinach came into play it went downhill fast. It just didn't taste great all together, unfortunately IMO. 

All around the food was good, and my friend and I had fun, but I now know not to order when I go back. :)"}
{"text":"Ok people, how is it that the last time I visited here was nearly four years ago and I forgot about it?  But subconsciously I somehow remembered what I ordered.  How?  Is?  That?  Possible?

I don't know what it is about a burger that has an egg and bacon on it that attracts me like bees to pollen (no, it's not bees to the honey, but that is another rant for another time).  I'm thinking that it's the appeal of breakfast, but the satisfaction of dinner that does it.  To say that this burger is big does not do it justice, to describe this you should use gut-buster.  This amount of food that you are holding in your two hands is enough to send you into a food coma.  Two thick slices of toasted to perfection Texas toast try their best to keep your hands grease free for as long as they can, but in all honesty, you should just accept the fact that there is no way you are getting out of there without using a stack of napkins.  The burger patty itself is cooked to your liking with the right amount of spices.  The egg is your basic fired egg, nothing special about it, but somehow definitely belongs on this burger.  The bacon people, my god, what is our obsession with bacon, I'm not complaining, but why in the world does it makes EVERYTHING better!  This bacon just crumbled once it hit the tongue.  Crumbled into salty goodness that makes your heart smile.  Yes it was that good!

It took me so long to eat this monster that I was lucky that my friend had gotten one of their TV dinners.  The side was nothing more that fresh cut fries.  I'm not going to go much into that as if you read my previous review how upset I was at that change.

Our server needed a little work.  Very monotone and kind of reminded me of Sam the Eagle from the Muppets.

All in all, it was a good experience.  Hopefully one I won't forget the next time around."}
{"text":"I want to love this place, I really do, and I usually don't give bad reviews. With that being said, however, our visit to double wide was not a returning worthy one.

First things first: Service= terrible. I work in a coffee shop and never should you ever let your customers just sit there for ten minutes without even asking if they want water...especially if it's slow! One of the waitresses walked past us four times, got the people in front and behind is, and didn't even say hello to us or be right with you. Service like this is really unacceptable. I would understand if it were busy, but the fact is that it wasn't. 

Food: now the only reason I would ever return is the food. It's so good...and that's what makes me want to love the place. We both had seitan wings which were cooked to perfection and tasted wonderful. We also ordered a basket of fries, not worth it. They charge you 4 dollars for literally one potato worth of fries...and they weren't even good looking fries. They were soggy and cold. 

So just beware going here. Good food. Bad service."}
{"text":"Double Wide Grill is one of those places you go to when you just want to have a fun, enjoyable meal.   And for those of you from Chicago, I don't mean the \"fun-crammed-down-your-throat-with-a-toilet-plunger\" atmosphere of Ed Debevics.  It's a place to simply go an enjoy yourself.

So I was out with my girl posse on Friday night.  We were going to the movies nearby at South Side Works, so we wanted a place nearby to have a casual meal.  We started our meal with some wood grilled veggies, which were delicious.  They have an interesting concept here called \"TV Dinner On Trays\" in which you can build your own platter by choosing 1 \"On Tray\" and 3 sides for $15.99.  Marla tried that and wimped out 1/2 way through it, so she took some home.  Sherry tried the barbecue chicken ranch salad.  Maryann went for the wood-grilled chicken burrito.

And then there was Susan.  Sometimes Susan gets really hungry.  Sometimes Susan wants just a plain ole good cheeseburger.  And there's only one type of meat that Susan acknowledges as a burger--beef!  No turkeyburgers, no ostrich burgers, and certainly no veggie burgers will do.  Besides, veggies are a side dish, not a main dish.  Oh, and Susan's cheeseburger?  Yummy medium well with grilled onions."}
{"text":"I've been to the Double Wide several times - it definitely has it's pluses, but also has minuses (hence, the middle of the road rating).

Pluses:

The cornbread:  It's good. It has a sugary crust on it that is a delightful surprise. I love corn bread and the Double Wide has gooood cornbread!

The drinks: Fantastic, in general. The beer selection is great and they will bring you a sample of anything they have on tap to make sure you like it before you order a full draft.  The mixed drinks are generally pretty good too. They have a great mixed drink/cocktail menu that has a lot of fun stuff on it. That said, I've been there for brunch and what they serve as their bellini is NOT a bellini, which is really disappointing.

The seating: It's big. You likely won't have to wait for a table. The outdoor seating is awesome when the weather is nice. It's a good place to watch sports (hockey!) because they have two huge TVs in the dining room and several other smaller ones.

Minuses:

The service: I've never had great service there. It's always slow and spotty. So frustrating.  

The food: It's hit or miss, really. It's a shame because the menu is super varied and has a ton of options for everyone - carnivores, vegetarians, vegans, gluten-free, etc. It's just NOT consistent. I've had really good food there, but I've also had really bad food there. I've had great pulled pork and horrible ribs. Great fries one time, crappy, cold fries the next. But the cornbread! The cornbread is always good!

Sooo. Bottom line: I never go out of my way to go to the Double Wide, but it's a good place to go to if I want to watch a hockey game w/ a group of people or every place else is packed."}
{"text":"A bbq steakhouse with a menu for vegetarians that goes beyond boring salads! Of course I had to try it. The decor's interesting, friendly and casual. I can see this place being fun on a summer afternoon. I only focused on their vegetarian menu because I don't eat meat and I was absolutely lost for choice which NEVER happens..and at a bbq place too! I settled with the seitan wings and their new aloha burger with a pineapple salsa sauce which was excellent! The meatless stroganoff was ok.. tasty, just not what I was expecting. The portion sizes are large. I have to go back to try their cheeseburger and cheesesteak and veggyros!! OMG! Everything I wanted to eat but couldn't! Needless to say I'm going back. Also, it helps that they make super stiff cocktails (nothing fancy, think sweet and potent!) and politely put up with my requests of \"a little less this\" and \"can I add that\" to my cocktail gives them an extra star!"}
{"text":"So going back since this last review and things have turned around completely. The last few meals have been great, servers are nice and times have sped up. Maybe there's some new management but I can't complain. We go there a lot. One of the best places in the summer too!"}
{"text":"They just opened two weeks ago. With that being said the service is still below par. The wait for our food (ticket time) was +35 minutes. The server did not understand the difference between vegan and gluten free even when we attempted to explain it. The food... I ordered a portobello Ruben which was surprisingly really good. The portobello was cooked perfectly. The serving size of the sweet potato fries was very skimpy though. I am looking forward to going back in the spring when it is warm and I can take my puppy with me for outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Very cool place with great beer selection. Our server was very friendly and prompt. I didn't love my sandwich but I didn't hate it. It just kinda was. 
The fried rice balls were delicious, though!  I'd eat a bucket of those with some good beer any day!

Update: we've been here many times since moving to the neighborhood and I'm starting to wonder why we keep returning. The food is mediocre at best but the servers were always so friendly and quick it normally made up for it. This last time the service was awful and when the service is bad it makes you realize all of the things you've overlooked before."}
{"text":"Not the same as the one in Pittsburgh's Southside. Here the atmosphere is much different (I suppose you would expect that since this is in a suburban location). The concept of the place is however similar. It is setup like an old garage and they have a bunch of different beers on tap. Their food is ok but there are better places you can go if you are looking for something to eat. What this place has to offer is the good craft beer selection in a somewhat unique atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here late on a Thursday night, and our server was SO attentive (granted we were the only party there). Only beer on tap and food from the deep frier were available - but um, what else would I want late at night in South Side?? So bring it on!

We got hot and also barbecue seitan \"wings\" with blue cheese dressing, and loads of raw veggies. The seitan plates were pretty small, but clearly delicious, because we devoured all of it. Even the obligatory celery sticks.

They have a pretty solid beer menu, and the wait staff wear the most charming grease-monkey one-piece suits. It sounds like I'll have to return in summer to get some of that outdoor seating."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I was looking forward to it. Our server was good. Large vegan/vegetarian menu. We started with the Reuben egg roll which was pricey, but delicious. I ordered the Meatless Stroganoff and he ordered a Billy BBQ Burger. He loved his and I wasn't impressed. 

Atmosphere was loud and crowded, which is to be expected for a new place. For this area it needs to be more affordable. I might go back, or not."}
{"text":"Decent beer selection. Above average barbecue for a restaurant in Pittsburgh. The Rueben Rolls are really good but I wish they gave you more than three. Great outdoor seating area. There isn't anything awful about this place but there is also nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"Ok so in all fairness I have to admit that I was not there to eat but for karaoke and booze filled bachelorette party fun.
I can't say anything about the food, but the menu looks great, and it's nice to see such a large vegetarian/vegan selection for those who prefer that type of cuisine.
This review mainly concerns our waiter, Mike. 
Mike was about as awesome as a party of 11 revelers could ask for. He took every drink order, remembered it properly,even though we moved around the table,  and never blinked an eye at us when someone ordered 11 shots for the table...more than once. He also went above and beyond when one of the bridesmaids had a \"wardrobe malfunction\" with the strap on her tank top and brought us a pair of pliers to help fix it. 
Mike is the kind of employee any establishment would be proud to have!!

(and I'm totally coming back here to try some pulled pork or brisket!)"}
{"text":"Let me paint the picture of my evening spent here. 

Like most nights it began with a single thought \"I want to get drunk.\" This thought usually turns into action and within an hour I have found myself a cozy watering hole. BUT, this night was different. Not only was I thirsty, I was also HUNGRY. Eating out isn't something I do often, I like to save what little money I have for libations. 

I've always been intrigued by this place. It kinda has this late 50's service station look to it. Has some sweet lights and even some corn hole boards in the corner. Since I was the East Cayahoga state champ of cornhole back in '83 I figured it was reason enough to check out the place. Outside seating is a plus especially since the weather was actually nice. 

The biggest plus was that I coordinated my visit with 35c wing night. I consider myself an amateur coniseour of wing and wing like foods (basically anything you fry) and let me tell you, these guys blew my socks off. They were fried perfectly with just the right amount of crispiness, they were pretty good size and the sauce was orgasm worthy. 

So in conclusion roll on in to the double wide grill and let em lube ya up with the sauce and some frosty brews."}
{"text":"One of the few places in south side that offers vegetarian or vegan options. Unfortunately those are always bland and mediocre at best. I've had their vegetarian chili, which was more of a bean soup with no flavor and no kick. Thank god it came with corn bread or I'd have starved.Their seitan wings are probably their best vegetarian option. Their potato tacos are also bland and flavorless. Vegetarian/vegan shouldn't mean flavorless. Decent service, although there's almost always a wait."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed and unimpressed. My boyfriend and I were visiting our friends in Pittsburgh last weekend and we were really excited to try this place, due to their many options for herbivores. We ordered delivery and discovered the restaurant was out of the ingredients needed for our desired order...whatever, it happens. What really annoyed us was the quality of the food or lack thereof. The seitan \"wings\" were both tiny and so salty that we ended up just throwing them out. (Apparently, DWG equates \"Cajun\" with \"nauseating/dehydrating dose of Lawry's Seasoned Salt.\") 
We also ordered the lentil Nekkid Burgers. These are, evidently, just a patty and a bun, hence their name. Unfortunately, no amount of condiments compensated for the simplicity of these pathetically dry, cold patties. These too, were thrown into the trash.
Bottom line: I literally haven't written a review in years but severe disappointment prompts one to warn others."}
{"text":"I found out about Double Wide Grill on the search for great restaurants with plenty of vegetarian options, which they certainly have!

I've come here for dinner and drinks a couple times and it's been fairly decent both times. Their service and location are both unfortunate, seeing as the hostesses do a good job of ignoring guests and it's located smack-dab in the middle of the Southside (womp womppp). I will say, however, those veg chicken wings (make sure you get the garlic parmesan) are the BEST veg wings I've ever had! Spak Brothers is definitely a close second.

My main entree for both instances was pretty good, but not outstanding. I had a crispy tofu dish with lime and cilantro and rice. While it was yummy, it was one of those situations where it wasn't tasty enough for me to want to eat the leftovers for lunch the next day.

All in all, Double Wide has a wide variety of O.K. vegetarian options, though there isn't a whole lot that really stands out (aside from the seitan wings). Be wary of the service! They can tend to be a bit on the unfriendly side."}
{"text":"When I first saw a Double Wide location near my in laws I got pretty excited. I've been to the South Side and Mars locations numerous times and have really enjoyed the food and beer selections.

But the choice for this local chain's third location seems a bit off the mark. It replaces a longtime restaurant that older folks seemed to love called Teddy's, so I think that's one aspect that would make locals want to pass on this place. The little turn off at the light to Double Wide is still called Teddy Drive.

We came here at dinnertime on a Saturday -- it was oddly desolate. I think there were two other families there in the dining area around 5 p.m.? It looked a little busier in the bar. Decor is a little more bare than the other places.

I had the brisket, and it was as good as ordering it at any other location. It's moist, tender, practically melt-in-your-mouth and the sauce is mild but complements it well. I also had a few bites from the hubby's plate; he got the TV dinner meal so it was a sampling of all kinds of things. The pulled pork was very good, but the sauce was much hotter than I remember it being. I like spicy, but this was borderline over the top. I felt bad for my MIL, who ordered the pulled pork and couldn't even touch the sauce. Fries, traditional or vegan shoestring, are both very good.

On the other hand, I don't think the vegetarian menu translates very well in this market. Double Wide has an impressive vegetarian selection. It's arguably one of the best vegetarian restaurants in the city, but the server told us not to bother looking at the last two pages of the menu unless we're vegetarian. I thought that was kind of a shame, since their veggie menu is very good too, regardless of diet.

Overall, I love Double Wide, but will probably opt to go to one of their other locations over coming back here again."}
{"text":"So gooooood!! My bf and I are vegan and we're struggling to find any good vegan restaraunts - this place caters to vegans/vegetarian/meat eaters.

Their seitan wings are to die for and I'm in love with the vegan philly cheese steak .. highly reccomend for all types of diets!"}
{"text":"The best bbq I have ever had in a restaurant, hands down. And this includes the Carolinas. I have been to alot of places folks rave about bbq, but Double Wide has a great menu for vegans and meatlovers alike! So it is perfect for a mixed crowd. The atmosphere is fantastic."}
{"text":"I want to like this restaurant and I keep going back bc I keep thinking its going to get better and it just never does.

The atmosphere is fun and the outdoor seating is great.  The atmosphere is the only reason to go here.

Well, their beer list is pretty good too.  That's why they get 2 stars.  Also, they do have a lot of vegetarian and vegan options so if you've got a veg friend and they want some mediocre food, take them here.

Do not get hte cilantro lime dressing unless you want to have wretched breath all night.

I've always had good service here.  I know a lot of people say they've had some problems but the service has always been great.  Considering the amount of really beligerent drunks this place gets, they staff is always nice!"}
{"text":"Save you money and your tastebuds from this place. From the Lucky Diet soda that tasted like medicine to the supposedly smoked for hours AYCE ribs that don't even have a hint of smoke flavor or a smoke ring that you would get with smoked meat. IMHO it's really not all you can eat when they make a product so bad you can't eat all you can eat and I have eaten at many places in my travels that served smoked ribs as advertised here at double wide grille but there is no smoke flavor in their what I considered at best over baked oven cooked ribs foil wrapped in the final stages to make them fall off the bone. Since I was paying for AYCE I figured I would get at least one reorder after my initial serving. After placing my reorder it took exactly 16 minutes yes I timed it because I was already so unhappy with this place that resides on the once famous Teddys Resturant that spent years at this location after Howard Johnsons went under many many years ago. So after getting what was equivalent to 3 or 4 more bones of ribs on the 16 min refill that arrived cold I could not even eat another bite asked for my check and left. I don't see this place being in the township to much longer. It was mostly empty when I was there and I guess there is a reason it's not that busy for food. I did notice that they are still getting a younger crowd of sorts that's resorting to alcohol more than expecting decent food here. If your from out of town or a local I would keep driving past this place. The food $uck$ and is very pricey. Your welcome in advance and for those who don't heed to my warning I'm sure I will see your unbiased review along with mine."}
{"text":"My dad and I stopped in here on a Tuesday night for dinner a few weeks ago, and we both felt this place was just ok.  There was nothing wrong with the food when we ate it, but it was about $50 for two of us with a tip.  Too steep for non-memorable food.

I ordered a shrimp burrito ($12) that was ok.  The amount of shrimp was decent for the price, but it was just beans, rice, and shrimp.  My dad ordered a burger that was also fine.  We then ordered 2 slices of cake.  A chocolate cake, that was supposed to be super chocolate-y, was flavorless.  The red velvet was slightly better, but at $6.95/slice, neither was worth it.  My dad ordered a beer that was ok, but overall, most of the food was something you could make at home.

I wouldn't come back here except for the Vegan options, which bumps this place up to a 3 star rating."}
{"text":"We had a great time. Although it was a big menu, it offered a fantastic selection of food and beer for whatever mood you were in. The bar staff was friendly and helpful and we enjoyed ourselves for a quick bite and brew. A definite fun spot and we loved the three legged dog t-shirts!"}
{"text":"I have been twice.  Both times service was HORRIBLE (I was a server for years).  They were mean, inattentive, and didn't care that my chicken sandwich came out RAW!  The second time the server never checked on us and as soon as we were done eating brought us our checks.  We wanted more drinks and told her that.  She never came back with our order and when we asked her about it she said she was waiting for us to pay.  Doesn't make any sense.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"I'm writing this based purely on the dog park section. I'm not sure what the full restaurant is nice. The only reason we ever go here is because we can take the pups. They have a small doggie friendly menu and offer lots of bowls with water pitchers. The people food, however, is always lacking. Tiny portions and always feels half-assed. I've heard nothing but excellent things about the inside restaurant, though!"}
{"text":"Well. I realized that I am LONG overdue for my first-ever review update, and what better place than Double Wide, a place that I went from loathing to loving. (Okay, not *loathing* so much as *being kind of weirded out by and disappointed in*. But definitely to *loving*!)

Every year, I help run the Pittsburgh chapter of National Novel Writing Month. We are an unruly bunch of writers, some of us meat eaters, some vegan, some of us gluten free, and all of us really really hungry before the month begins in November. So, we gather at the end of each October to get together and eat and chat before the stress of the month turns us into a bunch of crazy sleepless writers.

Our old spot was no longer working out, so a friend recommended we try Double Wide a few years back. I was skeptical - my initial visit in 2011 was less than enthralling - but I agreed to try. A small group of us went in for brunch to eat and chat with the staff about hosting our event. 

I have never once regretted our decision to start using Double Wide as our Kick-Off Party headquarters, and we have been back three years in a row now.

Our group ranges from 25-40 people, and each year, the staff has handled us with ease. Lots of menu options to choose from? No problem. Separate checks? They don't bat an eye. Special menu items for our friends with dietary restrictions? They are ON IT.

I really can't say enough good things about the staff. They are just fantastic, from the management, to the servers, to the chefs who put out all sorts of tasty snacks.

Seeing as how I can't teleport back to my experience in 2011 and check myself, I'm going to assume that we just visited on an off-night, because it's been nothing but awesome on our last several visits to Double Wide.

#1. The salads are huge and terrific and come with CORNBREAD. A+++++

#2. In the summer, you can come mid-bike ride on the GAP and they don't care if you are smelly as heck!

#3. YOUR DOG CAN COME HAVE DINNER WITH YOU IN THE SUMMER. (Haven't tried this one out yet, but the first nice day of 2017, Miss Layla Grace is hitting up the Double Wide patio!)

#4. Drinks are cheap and yummy.

#5. Seriously the service is the best. Every server is amazing.

#6. They are not scared off by your massively large unruly group, and they are easy to get in touch with, easy to schedule, and they follow up and everything is heaven for scheduling.

#7. They will refill your water ten billion times during dinner, and I know this seems like a minor detail, but it is actually very important. Because, you know, hydration for your health and all that. ::love::

So yes. I'm still not huge on the trailer park decor, but WHATEVER I'm a convert and I love this place. Thank you, Double Wide, for welcoming me back after a not-very-impressed first visit and showing me that there is beauty in the South Side after dark. :)"}
{"text":"Best mussels I've ever had. Great food, great prices, great staff, and awesome atmosphere!!! We'll be back."}
{"text":"I've had lunch here several times and was pretty impressed. I was there for dinner last night and ended up leaving after sitting for 2 hours and never getting service. I had to practically tackle the bar tender to get an iced tea. A little more organized table management needs to be incorporated. I was the only one who sat for a long time without service. I saw another guy chase a server down to get food after sitting for 40 minutes.

Good food, terrible service."}
{"text":"This place is great! The staff is friendly and incredibly helpful. The decor is a fun nod at its original roots of being a full service gas staion/garage. 

They definitely cater to a large crowd. Anyone can find something to eat here whether your vegetarian, omnivore, or even vegan! I highly recommend their Bloody Mary's. Their a perfect blend of kick with a little bit of heat without any of the crazy fad nonsense garnishes. You also can't go wrong with their Seitan Wings, even if you an omnivore! The breading and sauce are just too good to be true."}
{"text":"Family member brought me here a few days ago (friday night).  The place wasn't packed, and it was easy to find a table.  Good selection of beers, and the decor was rad (there's a CAR?!)  Place looks like an old garage, and the old advertisements are also awesome.  

There's something called the Polar Bear Club, where if you consume all of your food/drink outside, your bill is half off.  Coming from San Diego, I have no idea why ANYONE would want to do that (esp. since there's plenty of room inside).  Needless to say the table and chairs were covered in snow, as if to say that they wouldn't be expecting anyone anytime soon."}
{"text":"It is hard for me to rate a place that I frequent simply because I live right by it, so I am trying to look at this from the perspective of me not living so close.  

I like the general atmosphere especially the patio which  is always awesome on a beautiful day... however, I do not know about the service.  I always feel like I am putting my server or bartender out when I am asking for something.  Why be in the service industry if you do not want to be even slightly attentive to your tables?  I can understand if they are short staffed, but it never seems that way.  If you are in a hurry, I do not suggest coming here when they are remotely busy as even something simple can take quite awhile.  

The food is average... nothing to write home about, but not bad either.  Good beer selection and some unique good drinks too."}
{"text":"Double Wide is a good bet if you're looking for plentiful portions of decent food.  The menu is pretty broad and can suite a diverse crowed. Service is fine. The beer selection is also good with plenty of selections.  The bar area also gives a good place to watch games on their large screens and the bigger booths give room to meet with friends.  Based on a recent experience if you're looking for a really good salad while watching your intake - the double wide salad with flank steak was really good. Pic included."}
{"text":"Between three and four stars. Fun atmosphere in the summer. Food is unique. I love spicy food - so I got the Cajun pasta. It was beyond spicy. Prices are reasonable and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in Pittsburgh for the NHL Bridgestone Winter Classic.  On gameday, we drove to the Double Wide Grill for a late lunch before finding parking to get to the game.  My boyfriend is vegetarian and I am vegan, so I picked this spot because it has options for us.  It was a little tricky finding it--we were surprised to see 2341 before 2339, but once we found the right place, we walked in and were seated quickly. There is a separate vegetarian/vegan page on the menu, and items are clearly marked.  My boyfriend and I started with the seitan \"wings\" in the BBQ sauce, but they were really hunks of seitan, deliciously seasoned, and almost crispy.  For an entree, he got the Potato Tacos while I got the Tofu Skewers.  The skewers came out slathered in BBQ sauce with rice and a green bean melange.  Sadly the vegetable was forgettable, but the skewers and rice were utterly delicious.  I give them extra points for not putting broccoli, a vegetable I despise, on the skewers.  On my one visit, I found the service rather friendly (and we were wearing our Washington Capitals jerseys in Pittsburgh Penguins country), if a bit slow.

I will certainly recommend it to friends traveling to Pittsburgh and I will go back if I am ever in Pittsburgh again."}
{"text":"My wife and I regularly take our dog here to the outdoor patio area.  It is one of the very few places near the south hills where we can eat and have a drink with our dog.  They even have a separate dog menu.  They are very careful to avoid contact with the dogs and the area is set off by itself away from the rest of the customers.  

The food can be hit or miss.  I have had their burgers, wings, sandwiches, and many of their appetizers.  However, few things have ever stood out.  The one appetizer I would highly recommend are their Reuben egg rolls.  Very unique dish that is filling and has a great taste.  Other than these however, nothing has ever been memorable.

The service is always extremely slow.  No matter how busy it is, it always seems that we can never get in and out the place in under an hour.  The staff are always very friendly I will say though.

Overall I love that you can take your dog here and that alone will keep me coming back.  However I would definitely like to see some better food options."}
{"text":"Seitan wings and junkyard nachos were pretty good. Service was great but somewhat slow for a non-busy night"}
{"text":"I like to talk about an appetizer that is sheer ingenious and so delicious! A Reuben Roll! When I saw this on the Menu! I was so curious! When it came out I was like..... Great choice! You have to try this! It's enough for a meal if you  include some fries!"}
{"text":"Ordered the get er' done ribs (fall of the bone) and cornbread were fantastic, pulled pork and brisket were very good...really liked the Memphis sauce and creamy coleslaw the portion size was big enough to feed 2 of us.

they do offer specials but the server didn't tell us about them so make sure you ask (I overheard when someone asked...had we waited a few minutes to order our app it would have been 1/2 off...literally less than 5 minutes) 

The atmosphere is festive and clean, they offer places to recharge your cell/iPad you need to ask for the wifi password 

I really liked the food and atmosphere, definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to their Pittsburgh location many times and the food is always perfect.  First time at their new Irwin location and the food was just ok. Went for a late lunch and ordered the crab fritters which seemed slightly burnt and/or fried in old oil.  Enjoyed the pork and pineapple wrap just wish I had pineapple in every bite.  Mother had the chicken avocado blt she said was flavorful but the lightly grilled bread it came on was a tad too greasy.  Young female staff and our server was very nice and knowledgeable.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Atmosphere is that of a garage. We went expecting more of a diner. It is closer to gormet. Parking can be a problem."}
{"text":"Stopped by today for brunch. I haven't been to double wide in almost a year. This was my first brunch with them. I found their brunch menu large and full of options.. Same as their dinner.

I went with stuffed French toast (stuffed w. cream cheese) which came with a side of potatoes. My bf ordered the double wide Benedict. My French toast was ok, but idk it sounded better in the menu. The cream cheese was off. Idk if it was fat free or vegan or whatever. The French toast itself was great. The side of potatoes were lacking in quantity, but still were good. My bfs Benedict was (to his surprise, lol) served on cornbread. He substituted cheesy grits for his potatoes. He enjoyed it but said the eggs were cold. He's extremely picky on grits and didn't like it either (i tried it as well. Again, the taste was off) he said the meal would've been better if the eggs and corn bread were hot.

Service was good. Our server was new but still did a great job.

I've experienced double wides ribs and other comfort food dishes. The menu and food are good, as well as the service. We live nearby and come by seldom, but we still do visit. I just personally feel that its a little overrated and sometimes the food isn't as great as expected. today's meal proved the same. It is a cool spot though in the summer with the patio and dog patio. The food and drink menu are great."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting the city and someone recommended this place. We went with a taste for barbecue. Double Wide delivered! I got a platter with some pulled pork and brisket. So tasty and tender. It came with two small cups of sauces and I enjoyed mixing each meat with each sauce, to find the best combo. They also had the best cornbread I have ever had! There were two choices for coleslaw, and I got the vinegar and garlic option, which I didn't care for so much for. It wasn't creamy at all. Overall, I did feel like it was slightly pricey, but maybe that's just that area. Service was satisfactory."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here after reading the great reviews. Since we had both vegetarians and meatatarians the menu really looked great It was mostly a let down. The food was okay. A bit overpriced for what you actually got. I wanted to get my son tofu only to find out you can only get it covered in a bbq sauce apparently? I couldn't just order plain tofu. It was weird. I got the crab, black bean, and corn fritters and they were very bland. I couldn't taste any crab and seriously where were the seasonings? We did enjoy a chilli cheese fries vegetarian style. The veggie chilli was the highlight of the whole meal. Also, someone got their cherry coleslaw and really liked that. Other than that nothing impressive. 
Also a previous reviewer had mentioned the scantily clad servers but I figured it couldn't be too bad since I hadn't seen it in other reviews, but I gotta say I wouldn't consider this a family restaurant. All the women were wearing low cut tanks with their bra straps and the bras themselves on some girls showing. Some were wearing shorts others tight jeans. Our server was very spacey and we kept having to repeat ourselves cause she just kept getting this dumb look on her face and not saying anything. The bathrooms were also super filthy. I don't see us coming back here."}
{"text":"I remember now why I was questioning going back to this dump, if you're looking for the cement floor warehouse look your in, otherwise I choose not to eat at the Home Depot, 2nd the waitress & mgr gave us a hassle about groupon, the food if you call it that is garbage bar food, if you're a drunk & don't care what you put in your gut, then this craphole is for you, please take this dumpster of a burger stand back to the confines of the south side w/ all the misfits ! TRASH, PURE TRASH ! FROZEN DEEP FRIED GARBAGE !"}
{"text":"I will start by saying the hostess was genuinely nice and my server did a good job. That being said, it was nearly empty and our food took 38 minutes to reach the table (I wasn't counting. I sent an email after the order was taken and after a while I checked)  we were sat in a table without a light with the patio door behind us ans a waitress station two feet away (literally)I was cold the entire time. The vegan fries were good...hot and you can tell the oil was fresh. Other than that, the food was subpar and way overpriced. 18$ I received a few rubbery shrimp, some dry  tilapia in a sweet sauce, grits they raved about and they were cold and old and some coleslaw....not a fan of cherries in.my slaw.  I won't go back.  There are too many places to eat at, that cost significantly less. The prices would be fine in Pittsburgh...not in a suburban neighborhood.  Disappointing!  I see why all the other reviews were bad."}
{"text":"The Pros:
GREAT comfort food
Strong drinks
Delicious brunch menu
Endless vegan and vegetarian options - EVEN FOR BRUNCH!  Yay!
Huge outdoor patio space
Nice women's restrooms
Expansive cocktail list
Adorable, kitschy atmosphere
Flo, the waitress in the bar, is the best

The Cons:
You can't make reservations
They can get pretty packed
Food is reasonably priced, but the cocktails hit the wallet a little harder than the atmosphere makes it seem like they should."}
{"text":"Fun times in the South Side!

I decided to have a get together here for a birthday.  I called ahead to see if they take reservation...they don't, not even for a party of over 20.  I called once and the hostess said that someone would call me back.  They didn't.  I attempted to call again and they just said they don't take reservations.  I think this is a mistake on their part.  If you have more than 20 people you essentially need one server dedicated to your table.  I don't think they can properly plan for the evening.  

Moving on...I arrived early, 5:30 ish to drop off balloons and determine if they would be able to accomodate us.  The hostess looks me dead in the face and asked if I had a reservation or if I called ahead!!  WTF!!  Seriously!!  I looked at her and said did you jsut ask me what I think you asked me?  She repeated herself and I laughed.  I mentioned I tried to call several times and was told they don't take reservations.  LOL!!

I mentioned that we would be back in about an hour and that guests would start arriving around 7:30pm.  They kept trying to seat me inside but I kept mentioning that we chose to go to this restaurant because you could sit outside!  

They truly have a great outside seating area and it is right on East Carson street!  

They added some tables to an area and provided us with great service.  I honestly couldn't have been happier with our waiter, MIKE!!  Super nice guy with a great attitidee.  He was very accomodating.  He remembered what everyone was drinking even as we moved around our little area.  I can't say enough great things about the service we received from him.

I gave them 3 stars because they don't take reservations and make it difficult to accomodate large groups.  They also give you alot of hassle and don't seem to want to be real accomodating."}
{"text":"Had the Caribbean coconut tofu...totally bland and unseasoned! I was really hoping for great vegetarian food and will probably not be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome choice to end out day in Pittsburgh before heading home. All four in our group left full and happy. Food was great and out server was very friendly and attentive. Happy we stopped here."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my visit to Double Wide Grill.  They have a dog patio which seems like a good idea in theory.  I brought my gigantic 7 lb dog who i kept in my lap the whole time because this place was packed with dogs that people were not paying attention to.
Also, if you have to sit in the dog section, expect the worst dining experience of your life. You are treated like you have the plague. 
No one cleans the tables between customers, there is garbage on the ground everywhere.  You have to eat off Styrofoam plates and use disposable cutlery.  

The icing on the cake... the waiter cannot come into the seating area so you have to go up and wait until they come back out or hope to be able to catch them as you run up there bounding over dogs.You also have to get your food when it comes out.  

BUT they do not bring your food out in any particular order.  I was there with my friend and his entree came before our appetizer did. Then my dinner came out dead last after he was done eating and pretty much ready to go.

The food sounded good, but I honestly cannot say anything stood out. it was all kind of \"meh\".

I have been to many dog friendly eateries and this one may be dog friendly, but it certainly isn't people friendly. I probably won't ever come here again."}
{"text":"This was the first time I have ever had seitan wings. What a great substitute!! 

The coconut tofu was very bland and the rice and veggies were soaked in oil so
I didn't try them.

Service was very slow and forgot things like water and refills were rare.

Vegetarian menu was very impressive."}
{"text":"I came here with the hopes of having some quality BBQ. I was disappointed from the moment they brought out the food. We ordered a sampler that came with ribs, pork, and brisket. The pork tasted of nothing but vinegar. The brisket was tough and chewy. The ribs were not satisfying. Couldn't even finish this very expensive meal. Will never be returning."}
{"text":"This was our families 1st time here. This place is WAY overpriced for what you get. We paid $75 w tip for meatloaf, kids pizza, 2 chicken wraps, and a burger. We did upgrade a  few sides to soup.  The kids wanted wraps but not what came on them. Instead of substituting toppings, we got charged $.50 for tiny pico, .50 for tiny sour cream and $1.00 for ranch. Let me tell you that Dairy Queen snack wraps are about as big as these $12 wraps. Totally not worth it at all for any of this food. We will not be back and sure to tell others not to waste their time or money. We could of had a nicer meal at Applebee's or really anywhere. This was a $35 meal not $75."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were wondering around on the Southside while visiting Pittsburgh. I had heard that this place served BBQ seitan wings and was pretty excited to check this place out.

The decor is a kind of cheesy but retro in the same respect. I liked that they didn't clutter their wall too much like some restaurants. Our waitress came over to us and was sooo friendly but not in the annoying fake way. She was vegetarian and gave us the low down on what she really liked.

I ended up getting a Lentil Southwest burger with a side of mashed sweet potatoes and my girl got the BBQ tofu skewers with regular mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious and really hit the spot, especially after wondering around the city all day.

The waitress checked on us often and gave us some other restaurant suggestions while we were in town. I'm from Pgh but a lot has changed in the past four years. I can't wait to go back to this place."}
{"text":"No option for 0 stars, but the grits made me comfortable with 1 star. Here is the bullet points of our visit:

1- 15 minutes, no greeting.
2- waiter had the personality of a chalk board
3- 30 minutes for food
4- EVERYTHING was cold
5- the worst eggs Benedict presentation in history
6- more sauce, less paprika
7- no empathy
8- second round of eggs Benedict was terrible too
9- ran out of home fries, and without warning everyone got fries.

What a terrible experience. Just terrible. We both said on the way home \"we should of just got whoppers\"."}
{"text":"Food is great with a ton of selections!! They also have opened back up the dog friendly outdoor section. They had to section off from the rest of the area and they did a great job."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times. Our server this day was very nice. She told us it was wing night and so I moved away from my usual vegan gyro and got the BBQ  Seiten wings. They were delicious and 50 cents a piece or about half off for 5. 

It was my mom's birthday so we came because she had her birthday coupon. Make sure you sign up for their birthday club. You get essentially a free meal. Can't beat that. 

The menu here is extensive and there is sure to be something that you will enjoy on the menu. 

The decor is based off an old garage. So it gives it a gritty feel that for me almost ensures a good meal."}
{"text":"Reached the decision to give this place a try today even though I have driven past here numerous times and never felt drawn in enough to do so before. My friend and I agreed to meet for drinks and dinner, but since neither one of us likes to do the choosing, our on-going discussions eventually led us to come here.

I was prepared for an unpleasant experience since most of the reviews I read were not very favorable.  We planned to dine outside, but by the time our meeting rolled around it was raining pretty steadily. Besides the outside patio, there is seating in the expansive bar area or in a larger dining room on the opposite side. If you plan to take advantage of the Happy Hour specials be sure to sit in the bar area as they will not be offered in the dining room.  I never understood the reasoning behind this practice , but other establishments do the same thing.  If you order an appetizer seated on the left side of the room, you will pay more than the patrons seated on the right side of the room. Confusing.

The menu was much larger than I ever expected.  Strangely, for as big as the menu listings were, I really didn't seem to gravitate towards anything listed. I must have flipped through it several times before I decided.  Since I generally like brisket, I thought I would give their version a try.  The menu stated that it is only available after 5, so I was good to go. 

Our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time, and I found the brisket to be very tender and flavorful. However, it was a bit pricey for the portion size at $13.99 with a side of vegetables.

My first experience went better than expected, and I do like the concept and surroundings of this place well enough to go again to see if my ratings are any different."}
{"text":"Fast service

  I was in town and decided on brunch.  The original pick had a hour and a half wait so double wide was the backup choice.  I was seated immediately and the waitress was really fast.  I went with the carnivore omelet and it seemed like it came out in 5 minutes.  Unfortunately the carnivore omelet was lacking in the meat department.  I expected a lot more meat toppings than what came on it.  The taste was okay.  It came with breakfast potatoes and they were enjoyable, not special however."}
{"text":"I would give the food 5 stars and the service 3 so I decided 4 stars was fair. Given the fact that we sat as a table of 5 at 7pm on Friday night on the southside, I was expecting the kitchen to be backed up. But then again I got my food at 9pm. 2 HOURS LATER. That is just slightly crazy. Especially since the tables next to us were served a ton faster and left before we even got our food.

There was a bit of a mix up with the servers I think. There were two in the section we were seated in and nobody came over for about 45 minutes. We finally went up and asked the hostess and she sent one over to us. 

We ordered two of the full orders of seitan wings with sweet bbq and garlic parm. I absolutely love these! So good and definitely shareable for a table. The bbq ones were my favorite. On the side of the garlic parm ones was a dish of the garlic parm sauce that you had to pour over, but a lot kf the garlic oil came out first, kinda drenching the wings. Spoons for that are recommended!

I ordered the shroom and swiss lentil burger with fries. The fries were SO good. Chewy and crunchy and perfectly shaped with no sogginess. The burger was really tasty, especially the mushrooms. Lots of flavor! It was huge and super messy but I loved it.

I would love to come again when it is less busy and try some more vegetarian menu items! Maybe one of the seitan sandwiches next."}
{"text":"Really great service, great food, fun atmosphere, great vegetarian options, reasonable prices.

Had some of the best service I've had in recent memory, left the place full."}
{"text":"Okay--here I am nearly 5 years later back in the city.  I used to love this place and it has grown pretty well.  I like their vegan menu.  I like their beer.  The wait staff could be a bit more attentive, but overall I really like it there."}
{"text":"Food is a hit or miss here. My favorite thing I had was the cheesy grits. The side that used to be teddys old bar gets extremely loud because of the way the room is with high ceilings. Waitresses aren't very attentive either. We never got drink refills once and only saw our waitress when we ordered and then when she gave us our check. It doesn't matter if you have great food, if your staff stinks then no one will want to come back."}
{"text":"I recently became a Pescatarian so their aren't as many options as I had before  at certain restaurants I loved going to so it was refreshing to see that they had a whole menu dedicated to vegetarian/vegans/Pescatarians. This particular visit I tried the Seitan wings which taste wings, but on the other hand does taste a little \"substitutish\", but they are good. They are made out of a wheat protein and you can have any wing sauce that they have for their regular wings and the vegetarian wings are fried up and delicious. Also had a side salad with a cilantro lime vinaigrette thats really good too. My main dish I had the Jamaican Jerk pasta with added salmon. This is spicy but really good. it comes with a like creamy sauce with jerk spice. There are little onions, peas and peppers in it as well. Its a nice size portion."}
{"text":"Solid, greasy, comfort food whether you come here for lunch, dinner or breakfast. Lots of their menu items can be or are vegetarian or vegan. Big drink menu including some frozen concoctions such as blended mojitos and mudslides.

Huge TVs and lots of them, so I can imagine this place will be great to watch a game at. We'll see how they look during NBA playoffs!"}
{"text":"We come here way often! The food is delish,  the team divine! Many options that don't include meat! Our server today, Desiree, was exceptionally patient and helpful, guiding us through the newer menu! The price is always right especially with coupons Groupons and  discounted gift cards from Costco!!
Nice to have somewhere local to stop in for something healthy (or not - depending on mood) whenever the feeling strikes!!"}
{"text":"Tired to meet with manager Dave to schedule a party of 20+ people
He was TOO BUSY to stop out at the bar for
5 minutes
Take the party to Rodney's instead
Great business move
Place will be outta business unless the management changes there really soon"}
{"text":"We have been here twice, and most likely will not be back. Food is ok but takes forever and isn't really hot when you get it. The bar side is much more eye pleasing and has a more comfortable feel. I do love the fact that in the hallway they pay tribute to the 2 places that had been there before. I have been to both double wide grills and this one is not up to par with the other. I think with some changes this could be a great place, but sadly it only seems to be getting worse."}
{"text":"I like the concept of a garage-turned restaurant, I like the ample outdoor seating, I like that there is an area that I can take my dog to chill with us while we dine. I've just never really been thrilled by the food.  Most recently, we had burgers that were all over-cooked, dry, and a little difficult to finish.  The fries were ok, but nothing special.  Similar feedback for my hubby's buffalo chicken salad. 

If I find myself there again...lets face it, I probably will as its a cool spot to hang out...I think I will opt for the vegan/vegetarian choices, which always get good reviews, to see if these are more pleasing to the palate."}
{"text":"Terrible service and mediocre food. When 5 things on the order were wrong, waitress was combative. Both burgers were wildly over cooked. Vegetable of the day - snap peas and red peppers - were basically a burnt pile of oil with little flavor other than grease. Cuban sandwich was good but bread was a bit too oily. Prices were low is the only other positive."}
{"text":"Came here for some late nite food after barhopping down East Carson.

What else to get at a gas station-turned-bar than some cheap beer (Yuengling) and a big ol' order of 30 wings--both of which hit the spot. The beef chili was also delicious, with big chunks of peppers, onions and tomatoes.

Overall, I'd say this was one of the best places I ate at on my recent trip to the 'Burgh, and was a perfect way to cap off a night out with friends. I will be back."}
{"text":"Got the grilled veggie and Brie salad w/ grilled chicken. It was delicious and hit the spot! Came with corn bread which was moist and tasted great. I love when I get a good meal away from home!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the negative reviews. Just stopped in while in town. Vegan Bloody Mary?! Ok yes please! It was spicy and tasty. Also had a variety of sides (we have a three year old and a five year old) - the seitan wings were divine, the vegan sausage tasted good but was more reminiscent of meatloaf, the shoestring fries and the rosemary potatoes were very yummy and the avocado club was monstrous and delicious, ooh the garlic slaw too. I'd go back just to get that. We ate in the patio and the weather was perfect, inside did feel a little chilly to me. So vegans -- if you're in the area pay a visit!!"}
{"text":"This is a Great addition to the neighborhood. 
If you are vegetarian or vegan this is the only place in the hood that offers good GOOD variety of choices for this. On top of this it original deco ambiance good service and reasonable prices. Thank you double wide for opening this location. I used to go to the south side now it's close to home and for sure my top choice in casual dining!"}
{"text":"Really nice and a GREAT option. 

Really funky and crest menu which will bring a smile to your face HOWEVER when the food shows up you will be really pleased with the presentation, creativity, quality and taste!!! 

Home run. 

Great vibe overall. 

Would ABSOLUTELY GIVE IT A TRY."}
{"text":"My first experience of Double Wide grill did NOT leave me wanting more. When we first walked in the girl at the front was on her cell phone. Another girl saw this and said that the girl on the phone would be with us In a min. When the girl got off the phone she said \" I love you too\" so I'm gunna assume she was talking to a boyfriend or family. Completely inappropriate. The service was very slow and our waitress was nice but very quiet especially when they had a live band playing music, we could barely here her and had to ask her to speak up each time she came over. The food took a while to get served to us. My fiance got the breakfast burger which the meat was delicious and I felt seasoned well, it came on toast which became completely soggy from the grease so he was literally holding meat in between his fingers. I got the mac and cheese. It was OK but I wouldn't order it again. I felt the prices were too high in my opinion. I don't think we will be going back anytime soon"}
{"text":"Mediocre food at best and Very Rude. Our first time here was a couple of Summers ago on a visit from Florida. The food wasn't that great, but tolerable. 
 This past July, we were one again visiting the area as we do often and decided to go here because we had our small 8lb dog with us. The web site said they were pet friendly so we decided the mediocre food would be ok as a solution. 
  I walked onto the deck while my friend went inside to let someone know we were there. Keep in mind, no one was on the deck during dinner that evening. The girl he spoke with inside was very rude and demanded that we take the dog off the deck and around to a small section of deck enclosed by cheap lattice fence that felt like a kernel. Two girls come out who clearly did not want to wait on us and start handing us menus and silverware over this 4 ft fence. When asked if this was how we were going to be served, we were told that they couldn't get dog hair on them and take it back inside. My dog is 8 lbs, short hair, and laying down. All of this may have been acceptable except for the fact that the only three people involved in our experience made us feel extremely unwelcome by their words, facial expressions, and tone.
    My point is, please don't advertise a place as pet friendly if you are anything but friendly. Any dog owner will tell you that a dog is a family member. Traveling with a pet is not an easy task, but sometimes necessary. Being right off the PA Turnpike, I would think this might be a common thing. I have never been treated so poorly in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to the Pittsburgh VegFest 2016 today. 

Got a few *Hail Seitan* bbq wings from their food truck a tasty snack with a lil kick. On my list to try Veggyro the only downfall is I will bring my own tzatziki sauce, they use tofo to make theirs. Also want to try the stroganoff w/ red pepper rice. Can't wait to go back and try new snackies after some new tats."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised.  My Uncle and Aunt were in town, and he is decidedly a \"Meat & Potatoes man\" while my significant other is vegetarian... Double Wide is much more than just a compromise, they were both well satisfied.

The outdoor seating and atmosphere is great, especially if you get such beautiful weather as we did...  once you get used to the (sometimes ludicrous) rumble of Harleys as they leave on east carson.  I had a Border Patrol burger (avocado, peppers and cilantro) which was well grilled... nothing to go too crazy over but well done.  My significant other had a lentil burger version of the same and left very happy.

That said, who else in Pittsburgh serves SEITAN and TOFU and attracts bikers on harleys in the masses?  Granted, it was hard to tell if these were the authentic biker types or the Sewickley harley types but they weren't wearing helmets so I doubt they were from that uppity of a suburb.  I had my mind on a tasty burger but I can't wait to go back and try some of the vegan and vegetarian options (Seitan wings, seitan ribs, seitan pulled pork sandwich and salad and probably 3-4 other tofu/veggie options).

Oh, and prices were extremely reasonable.  Sandwiches and burgers were $5-8 with only things like steaks and ribs venturing into the teens."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a drink based on the recommendation of our shuttle driver. It is a tastefully decorated themed restaurant and bar. Although we did not eat, they had some really interesting and unique menu choices. Everyone that was eating seemed pleased with their food. The staff was all friendly. I am guessing that most of the patrons were tourists because there was no vibe of them being regulars or even locals. Since there wasn't much going on in the way of conversation or interaction at the bar, we just had one drink and left. We will have to go back in the future to try the foods."}
{"text":"Double Wide Grill has a pretty laid back, chill atmosphere. I had Sunday brunch here and was pretty satisfied with my meal. I ordered the Double Wide Benedict and devoured it quickly, mostly because I was starving at the time. The order was nothing spectacular, but it was a solid plate. The poached eggs were nicely done, and the hollandaise was good. They have a regular Eggs Benedict, but the Double Wide is unique because it is on corn bread rather than the English muffin. The salty sweet combo made it different and rather enjoyable. 

If you're looking for some outdoor dining, they have a nice area outside, which they call their patio - good for daytime brunch in the sun, or getting some fresh air with your beer during happy hour. 

Also look for their specials - ribs night and happy hour/night specials. I haven't been here for drinks yet, but they do have a nice draft selection. I'll be sure to check it out soon!"}
{"text":"I visited the Double Wide for one reason only: the vegetarian seitan wings, and they didn't disappoint. The seitan isn't that rubbery stuff you are in danger of getting anytime you order seitan at a new restaurant. In fact, to my delight it is almost a seitan-tempeh hybrid with just a hint more texture that really serves its special purpose of being turned into wings. With three choices for sauce (BBQ, spicy, or honey garlic), you can bet I've been back for seconds, and I don't even live in Pennsylvania. 

And how can you have wings without beer? They have a pretty respectable list and a patient staff who helped my wife and I get exactly what we were looking for on more than one visit. We even ventured into the food menu once and enjoyed almost everything we tried. If you're like me, the heavy-handed theme of the restaurant may be a bit of a turn off, but give it a chance. As it turns out, it is not one of those chains your parents dragged you to as a kid."}
{"text":"I don't know how many times I passed by this place before realizing it was actually an eatery and not some old shut-down gas station.  I am glad that I finally found it, though.  My only issue on this trip was that I had Sophie with me.  Oh well, into the jacket she went, and into the restaurant we went.  

Amazingly tchotchky interior, but amazingly appropriate for the location, the history, and surprisingly not overdone.  Not a lot of other customers, but we were in at around 3pm -- a time when most other people are not eating.  Looking through the menu, I was surprised to find \"Tear Jerker\" flavor for the hot wings.  My first thought was, \"BAH!  People in Pittsburgh don't know what piquant is and that is what I will be getting.\"  I then ruffled through the rest of the menu and we ordered the following items:

5 regular wings
5 tearjerker wings
split pea soup with ham
potato soup
DW Cheeseburger (plain/medium) with fries
Pepsi (x2)

I am uncertain about the full gamut of the menu, but they appeared to be fairly hospitable to those that were looking for gluten-free food as well as having many vegetarian and vegan options that were clearly marked on the menu.  

Our soups and drinks came out right after we ordered.  I didn't like the Split Pea soup.  It was grainy and tasted like it had just come out of a package.  I had a few bites and then just set it to the side.  I used my soda to wash the flavor from my mouth.  I didn't even bother to try the potato soup.  Not to long after I aborted soup consumption, the wings arrived.  My nose immediately caught the fragrance.  Oh...the smell was good.   My friend made it clear that I was not to have any of the regular since he was not going to eat any of the tear jerkers.

After having finished my scoffing at him, I went right for my wings.  The flavor was good.  They didn't burn.  I knew it; I continued on eating them leisurely while drinking my soda.  On the third wing, my nose, eyes and mouth burst into flames.  I couldn't believe it.  My complacency had caused me to be unprepared for the piquancy.  The delayed ignition only hurt my pride a little compared to my friend laughing at my running nose and the tears coming out of my eyes.

As I finished the fourth wing, the hamburger arrived.  I abandoned my last wing while I cut the burger in half.  It appeared to be more a medium-well than a medium temperature; this is a heads up to order a temperature lower.  The flavor was good and the meat wasn't overly dry.  I will order a medium-rare next time so that I get the proper temperature.  When I finished the burger, I ate the last wing.

I will return here.  There is no question about it.  I enjoyed the flavor of the wings, but next time I will not be unprepared."}
{"text":"Had lunch on Saturday afternoon around 2:30 pm. 

The good - 

outdoor patio seating and our wait staff.  Wait staff seemed knowledgeable about the menu and the beer list. The rice balls was tasty. Pull pork sandwich was okay but nothing  special. Overall service was excellent 

Bad - 

Beet salad wasn't good at all. Beets looks like it came from the can."}
{"text":"I wish I had gotten to eat here, but my friends and I went for post-happy-hour, pre-serious-college-drinker hours.   A perfect place for a drink on the rambling patio/porch/outdoor area with the doors open and the warm breeze wafting around.  

Highly recommend for drinks.  Can't comment on the food.  A total shitshow when the kids come out for the drinking, but that's when it's time for this old lady to go home."}
{"text":"This was a nice place to grab lunch. We sat outside on the patio, in what used to be a service bay. The atmosphere is pretty cool, if you're into \"early gas station.\" I can work with it. 

I wanted a Bloody Mary and it was pretty good. Not the best ever, but decent. My salad was honestly underwhelming...the goodies I ordered on top - avocado, steak, and cheese - were in very short supply, and since you pay extra for each, that didn't go over well with me. Vinaigrette dressing way really good, though. 

I appreciate the attempt at vegetarian versions of traditional barbecue and appetizer options. I don't need them, but I think it's cool to offer these options for people who do. 

This was the last place I ate in Pittsburgh and it left me with a good impression of the city's dining scene. At least it was a little different from the norm."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian slowly trying to reduce my animal product intake so I guess it's safe to say I prefer more of a Vegan diet. I used the Happy Cow app on my phone to find the restaurant as I am in town from Philadelphia. I ordered the BBQ seitan wings and let me tell you, they were better than I could've hoped for. My boyfriend got actual bone-in wings and said they left a little to be desired as far as taste goes (he got a spicy flavor. Forgot the name). We shared the Veggyro and it was just ok. The sauce it was cooked in was very heavily salted...and the cucumber sauce it came with left a little to be desired. Overall, I would 100% come back for the seitan wings, the good atmosphere and the location."}
{"text":"What's the definition of crazy - doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.  Well I can honestly say I've gone crazy b/c of Double Wide.  I keep going back, thinking and hoping that this will be the time it's good, this will be the time it's great, but then reality slaps me in the face and reminds me of why I avoid it here.

Besides the outdoor seating which is awesome, DWG doesn't have much going for it.  I've tried so many things on the menu and nothing sticks out as being \"good\".  But at the same time, nothing really screams \"bad\".  It's a totally forgettable dining experience.  

I refuse to be DWG crazy - I've reached the end of our journey together and hope that we don't have the unfortunate pleasure of meeting again."}
{"text":"Pretty decent bbq spot with many options on the menu. Not your hood bbq joint but its clean and nice for a good meal with family and friends."}
{"text":"I love it here! Their food is great, the staff is friendly, the menu options are splendid, and the atmosphere is terrific."}
{"text":"DWG frustration. 

Again...went to the Double Wide Grill on 4/11/15 around 6:45 PM. There were seven (7!) tables open in the bar area alone (seats at the bar were 100% occupied but all the booths and small tables were vacant) and at least 1/3 of the tables outside were vacant...and on a nice evening, too (clear skies and slightly chilly in low 60s as the sun was setting). Went in to get a table and was told it'd be 30 minutes. 

Yes...that's right, 30 minutes to get a table!! It's frickin Saturday evening...seat people. Either DWG cannot appropriately staff this restaurant or they have too many tables for their capacity. Either way, poor management. 

I won't visit this place again even though I like the food and staff. If I have to wait 30 minutes for an available table (of many tables already available), I'll go somewhere else where I feel wanted. 

Too frustrating."}
{"text":"Yea. Had massive stomach pains at 2:30 AM after eating here. 

I hate this place.

I seriously hate this place.

This place is what's wrong with the Pittsburgh dining scene."}
{"text":"I have been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Each time the experience is beyond mediocre.  It's a shame, b/c I really like the concept.  The bar here is really nice and I think that is it's biggest feature.  Service is OK on the restaurant side and good on the bar side.  I would just return to have a drink here and maybe an appetizer.  Don't expect much, and you'll enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love bringing out of town friends here, but it's not the only time I get here, I come in for lunch a few times a month. I love the \"white trash\" theme of this place, it even spills out into the menu.

I've been here three times and each time I tried a different item. On my last visit I had the vegan chilling. It wasn't overly spicy, nice flavor, the smokiness of the vegetables came through the chilli spices. Nice dish!

Over the summer I came in with friends to imbibe the beer selections. I found a nice IPA that went well with the seitan wings, corn and crab fritters and regular wings we shared under the big green truck at the bar.

Speaking of corn and crab fritters, this is the best thing on the app menu, you get a dozen of these tiny gems. Sweet corn and tasty pieces of lump crab together in a not too \"cakey\" batter fried to a golden fried goodness. A Cajun mayo comes with it that compliments these morsels of shellfish and maze wonderfully.

I have to say this place is as original as it gets. Back in the eighties Bob's auto bar downtown invoked a theme where you sat in gutted cars, but Double Wide Grill is much more inviting with a great location. My only wish was a parking lot, I wish I could have the time back I've spent trying to find a place to park. I subtract one star for being so busy at times I've driven away  with visions of corn and crab fritters dancing on my taste buds.

Editors Note: On 01-04-2012 I went to the Double Wide and had dinner with my mother who won a fifty dollar gift card at her Christmas party. She'd never been there and invited me to go. I told her she was in for quite a treat. So we sat down at 6pm, we never saw our waitress until about 6:10. It really wasn't that busy although they were waiting on a group of 32 which seemed to have everyone in a tizzy. Our waitress finally showed up and we were able to order. She had the pulled pork sandwich with fries and cherry slaw and I had the meatless Stroganoff with beans and rice and \"crusty whole grain bread. we didn't see our food for 25 minutes, it finally showed. My mother's pulled pork looked great, but, the first bite produced a bone. The cherry slaw was tasteless even after she added salt and pepper. My Stroganoff was delicious, but the rice and beans were cold and had gotten hard from sitting under the lights. My whole grain bread was missing, in it's place was corn bread, not a good pairing with Stroganoff. I rarely complain but i had to, the waitress was very nice and took the bill to the manager and we were comped the most expensive meal and my mother's drink was comped. This was the very first time in ten or eleven visits that i'd had less than satisfactory meals. I tip my hat to management for trying to make things better."}
{"text":"Was visiting a friend in town and they suggested this place. We parked a little far down for free street parking.

The pros of this place is definitely our sever being attentive as well as the variety of vegan options!

I ordered the BBQ brisket since it seemed like a bbq joint. The brisket was dry and the sauce helped but it couldn't mask all of the dryness.

The bbq sauce was freaking fantastic though! It had a great sweet tangy taste and the texture was more jammy, but definitely enjoyable! 

The bread roll they used on my sandwich was also tasty. It was soft, chewy, and slightly sweet."}
{"text":"Location, location, location...

My husband and I decided to stop in here last night for dinner. We asked for a booth and were seated on the \"dining room\" side, as opposed to the bar area. First mistake. The place is cold and just feels unfinished. There are several booths along the wall and we were seated at the last one, by the old exit door, when the place used to be Teddy's. Only one other booth was taken, why seat us way by the door. Oh, and take a gander at my pics, there are a ton of high chairs and regular chairs stacked - awkwardly - behind our booth. Second mistake; should have asked to move.

The place was freezing! I made a comment to our waitress, who stated that there was a gas line break earlier in the day and that's why it was so cold. Okay... They were supposed to open at 11am, didn't open until 3pm. Every waitress had on either a hoodie or an actual coat, that's how cold it was. Oh, and no brisket due to the gas line break.

After a short while, like 5 teenagers, I mean staff, came over and start moving tables together. Alas, they needed more chairs and high chairs! They kept going behind our booth and getting chairs, and at least 5 times actually hit the back of the booth with the chair. Extremely aggravating and rude. There was a table directly to the left of us put together for a big family with several little ones. Meanwhile, there is this huge, vast empty dining area where you could have set up these tables. At one point, one of the women got up and, since she had a purse and an extremely big diaper bag dangling from her chair, fell backwards, hitting our booth. That's how stinkin close it was to us. (again, location?)

The menu itself is way too big and busy. You simply can't have that extensive of a menu and it all be good. Or, maybe any of it. My husband got the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich with fries and I had the Border Patrol Chicken sandwich, which came with sautéed peppers, avocado, basil pesto and swiss. I asked for no avocado, but was allowed to add lettuce, tomato, and onion \"for no charge\" (gee thanks). Sandwich comes out with avocado. I know, shocker. We agreed that the food was good, definitely not great. 

I'm guessing that this is most of the staff's first job, just a guess. Definitely needs some fine tuning. Definitely not satisfied. Most likely not returning. 

Note: 2 stars only because our waitress was friendly and efficient. Otherwise, it would have been 1 star."}
{"text":"Good beer, burgers, and BBQ. The menu is pretty ambitious at first glance; they have like 4 different \"whole meal\" options, but I would recommend the TV Dinner option. Your choice of two mains, three sides, and cornbread. I've had all the BBQ and it's all good. The sweet potato fries are great too: they come out crispy and not too soggy. The reuben egg rolls are another good unique Pittsburgh item. I'd go back to this place."}
{"text":"A waiter said to my 8 yr old \"you almost made me fucking drop my glass\" when he bonked in to her. And they had no french toast at 1130am."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan dishes! Fun decor, but pretty noisy. Would be nearly perfect if they had vegan desserts too."}
{"text":"This is a pretty informal meeting space.  Excellent beer selection, usually good bartenders and waitstaff, but man when you get a bad one, it's going to be painful for everyone involved.  The food is actually pretty gross, and you will seriously be burping up your sins for the next 6 hours if you even look at a fucking hubcap fry.  But, when this place is not packed, it's really fun to just sit and relax.  Also, bonus for starting Karaoke on Saturdays, though judging by the crowd, that might not be around for very long."}
{"text":"Great service and tasty food choices! Wait staff is very kind and welcoming. Fresh cornbread is out of this world. Mom's meatloaf was moist and full of flavor! Eclectic atmosphere. Beth was a great waitress: helpful, funny and extremely sweet."}
{"text":"Was wandering around the South Side and decided to give this place a try.  I ordered the \"hot\" seitan wings, and they were very good but a bit spendy at $8.99 for 6 chunks of vegan protein and some soggy carrots.

There is a full bar here with a good selection of craft beer.

Bonus points for the dog-friendly patio.  I may come back with my pup for \"wing\" night wednesdays in the summer!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 5 stars for a few reasons: excellent service, fun atmosphere, and good bar/pub food. We had my boyfriend's 40th birthday party here on karaoke night (great party idea!)...I was able to reserve a spot for 25 in the karaoke room and put up decorations, they even played happy birthday on the big screen. The manger Justin was super accommodating and our waiter Alec was perfect, he really made the night!! This place is a super fun night out, highly recommended."}
{"text":"We frequent the Double Wide, for both food and drink. My go-to dish is always the chili, with their delicious cornbread (and I have been known to order cornbread just as my meal, there!). We also really enjoy the Junkyard Nachos. If you are there during lunch, the grilled cheese with bacon and pears is fantastic, and I am a huge fan of their weekend brunch! We love the staff (especially at the bar), and they are always fun and attentive!  Definitely a \"regular\" spot for us!"}
{"text":"I've been in here quite a few times and I really do enjoy this spot.  I've had a couple things that were so-so, but the things that are great are reaallly great! They've got some of the best nachos I've ever had; the cheese has a good kick to it and the chicken I add is always hot.  I also like the build your own tv dinner.  I get mashed potatoes, fruit, and the ribs [whomever I'm with picks the other stuff].  Soo good! The ribs are always tender and moist with a good amount of bbq sauce.

I'm typically a carnivore but my vegetarian and vegan friends swear by their vegan menu!

As for drinking, I typically get the Blue's Bathtub Tea which I believe is like a long island but with raspberry things instead of tea. Delicious!  Booze is a pretty reasonable price and they've got a lengthy list of beers on tap and bottle.

Everyone has their off nights, but most of the time the service is spot on, friendly and attentive. 

Overall, I would recommend."}
{"text":"I've been to the Double Wide Grill several times and have had mixed experiences, however, I went this past Saturday with my parents and it was a home run.  We started with the crab black bean fritters - very tasty appetizer.  
The draft selection was decent with a good list of seasonal craft brews.  For dinner, I had the meatloaf special with a side of mashed potatoes and a fantastic large piece of broccoli cooked to perfection.  My mom had the brie and portabella mushroom and my dad opted from the pulled pork sandwich.  No complaint from either of them.
Service was fast and attentive.  We were there at an off time - around 4:30 PM on a Saturday so it wasn't crowded, however, the staff was all great."}
{"text":"I went to DWG this past summer with my wife and two sons, we were visiting Pittsburgh and I knew of this spot thru previous internet research of the city. We went on a Sunday afternoon (around 5-6pm). Not being from Pittsburgh the area wasn't the most touristy but I've lived in bad neighborhoods so I was fine. We entered and were promptly seated. I ordered my older son a grilled cheese with fries and my younger one a peanut butter & jelly sandwich with fries. Me and my wife both ordered jailhouse TV dinners. Food arrived fairly quickly and the ribs were GREAT!, very meaty and saucy. But the highlight of the meal was those potato hubcaps, I would of been content with just eating a big plate of those. When I come back to the Burgh' I will definately get a few orders of those hubcap fries. In my TV dinner I did also have the coconut rum tilipia which was gross. The TV dinner is a huge meal, I actually left some food on my plate which I normally don't do b/c I am greedy but that is testament to how much food they give you. You get to pic item item from tray one and two and then 3 sides. The sandwiches my kids got were huge, they were kind of like texas toast in thickness. They were actually able to take half the meal home and eat it later. I will definately come back for lunch so that it is nice and sunny out and we can take our orders to go and enjoy them elsewhere in Pittsburgh as this is not a family restaurant as there was a lot of cursing and smoking going on at the bar which we were seated right across from"}
{"text":"I have been going to Double Wide Grill for many years, especially during the time I was living in South Side a few blocks from the restaurant. I would say about 50% of my experiences have been good. I decided it was finally time to write a review.

Double Wide Grill has a great atmosphere and  great selection of food. The restaurant is in a converted auto service station. They have a decent size dining room and offer a lot of outdoor seating when it is warm out. It is primarily a Barbecue joint that also has a large selection of sandwiches, burgers and vegan meals. The Barbecue is good. Probably a little too heavy on the pepper. I usually get ribs or brisket there. Both are good, but a little on the drier side than I would prefer. Mixed with sauce, the dryness isn't as noticeable. Their burgers aren't too bad. They also serve brunch on weekends. The brunch is good, but doesn't blow me away. Double Wide probably has the best barbecue in South Side, but certainly not the best in Pittsburgh. Double Wide also has a large selection of regular domestic beers and microbrews on tap. Their prices are reasonable considering you get a full plate of food.

My issues with Double Wide have primarily been with service and misleading advertising. There have been multiple times I have eaten at Double Wide when our server has only taken one person's drink order and leaves or just disappeared for long periods of time and didn't check on our table or offer us the check when the table was cleared. We used to leave long comments on receipts complaining about the servers, but stopped after we noticed they never would fire the ones which everyone had issues. My recent experience, and why I decided to write the review, was after trying to use a Groupon. Every year or so Double Wide Grill offers a Groupon to attract more business. The Groupon lists no exclusions other than not valid on alcohol and the other regular Groupon terms. I was very disappointed when they told me in the restaurant their daily specials such as all you can eat ribs and wing night are excluded from Groupon use. This is not listed on the Groupon anywhere. Double Wide insisted these daily specials count as 'other offers' part of the Groupon. They even told me multiple people had tried that night to use the Groupon on the daily specials. It is disappointing they use the Groupon to bring you in, knowing most people will try to use it on the days with a special, only to have to order something else.

I can't say I won't ever be back since I know friends will want to go there, and I know I am a sucker for all you can eat anything. However, I can say it will be a little while before this experience wears off and I return."}
{"text":"Double Wide always seems like a good option but I've never had it where everything was as good as I hoped it would be. My most recent experience there was after an exhausting bike trip and me and a few girlfriends stopped to fuel up. I ordered a shrimp salad that was awesome. The shrimp was blackened and cooked perfectly. The corn and avocado were great and the dressing was tasty. This was the first time I was excited about something I have ordered from Double Wide. Unfortunately, we had met one of the husbands who brought a dog. Double Wide has a dog area, which is wonderful, but I just don't understand the service. You are supposed to walk up to a counter area and order, which is fine, but it's almost impossible to get someone's attention to order.  I will probably go again but i will sit somewhere  where the waitress actually comes up to the table."}
{"text":"I only gave this two stars because of the decent vegetarian/vegan menu (I liked the seitan wings). I came back with my boyfriend and puppy because it was a beautiful day and we had known this restaurant for having a dog friendly patio (which we were looking forward to). As we approached the hostess stand I was immediately told to go to the new segregated dog friendly area of the patio which was sectioned off with a small wooden fence. This came as a surprise due to the fact that the reason we had previously liked this restaurant was for it's laid back dog-friendly atmosphere. As we approached a table we were disgusted by how filthy this area was- trash all over the ground, the tables hadn't been bussed... We sat and waited for a few minutes before a server yelled across the fence to tell us that menus and silverware were available on a plastic table for us to help ourselves to. The menus were small paper take-out quality and the silverware was in a tangled mess. We felt like we were uninvited guests at a trashy house party. Needless to say we left without notice. We ended up going to Aladdin's Eatery in Mt. Lebanon where we were promptly greeted by the manager with a bowl of water for our puppy."}
{"text":"I've been to the Double-Wide twice for brunch now. Twice, they've mixed up the side dish for one of the plates at our table. 

But their fun atmosphere and innovative breakfast items makes up for it. The huevos rancheros and the double wide benedict are both big winners - with special emphasis on the big. Their omelets are huge. Some of their items weren't as punchy with flavor as hoped, such as the breakfast burrito, but there are lots more items on the menu that I want to try. 

As a vegetarian-friendly customer, I'm super-happy to see interesting veggie items like the seitan wings, lentil veggie burger, tofu scramble and avocado club.

Overall, the double wide is a good brunch location - laid back, no lines out the door, and good food. It's probably even better in the summer with their large outdoor patio area."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now.  The first time was for dinner, the second for brunch/lunch.

I enjoyed my first visit here; I ordered the peanut tofu and found it to be delicious.  You don't see many places in Irwin offering vegan/vegetarian food, so while I'm not either, I love tofu.  I am overall disappointed in the menu because although they have a lot of great things for vegan/vegetarians, a lot of the food I simply can't eat because of other diet restrictions.  But the tofu worked all considering!  I enjoyed it a lot.  My boyfriend had their ribs and also enjoyed them.

My second visit there was very disappointing.  Apparently we came in during brunch, but our waitress didn't give indication of us being able to order brunch items so we didn't.  And were disappointed when we saw all these yummy dishes coming out that were brunch-inspired.

The food took a good 45 minutes to come out.  We were more than antsy to just eat.

I ordered the Mexican chicken salad, or something like that, and it was a big let down.  The cilantro lime dressing had way too much lime in it.  The salad was quite literally just bagged lettuce mix.  It was just overall disappointing.  My companions likewise were let down by their dishes (a pineapple chicken wrap and another salad).

After a \"pretty good\" experience and a downright negative one, I'm not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere with a ton of vegan/vegetarian options. Ask for Bilyta as your server - she is amazing and goes above and beyond!"}
{"text":"We went on Saturday night to satiate my craving for good karaoke. 

For food I ordered the \"TV dinner\" which is a huge metal tray of two entrees and three sides. I tried the pulled pork, half rack of ribs, cornbread, mashed potatoes, rice, and veggie of the day. The ribs were falling off the bone and tender, but could have used extra sauce. The pulled pork was dry and really needed extra sauce, and the texture seemed off. The sides were all pretty much awful. You could tell they make a big batch in the morning and it sits there all day. In addition they were all vastly underseasoned. My husband had the black and blue burger, which strangely enough he said was OVERseasoned. So the food was pretty much disappointing, but you do get a lot for the price, and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since they stop serving food at 11pm and we came at about 10:40. Next time we will try eating there earlier. 

The service was fine; the waitress checked on us frequently and promptly. They do have a good beer list and the beer prices are okay, although the mixed drink prices are a teensy bit high for my tastes (although probably comparatively low for some South Side venues). The restrooms were cleaned and fully stocked, which is a plus for such a busy bar. Speaking of busy, the place was packed when we came, and they do boast an awesome patio that probably more than doubles their seating capacity.

The karaoke was AWESOME. It really saved this place from getting a two star review. They had a great, lively crowd doing some really zany and entertaining performances. The host has the best karaoke setup I've seen: live video background of you singing, playback clips of your performance, and a VERY up to date computerized catalog. If anything, I'll be back for his karaoke! We'll give the food a second shot another day."}
{"text":"Double Wide on Carson St is probably the best outdoor eating establishment in Pittsburgh area. I know my way around Allegheny, Westmoreland, Butler and Beaver counties and choose to eat at DWG about once every 2 weeks. 

The outdoor patio area is huge, easily tripling total seating capacity. On sunny, warm days the number of customers rises sharply which can lead to some extra wait time for seating and food. It can also lead to certain slow-cooked barbequed entree's selling out before the evening is over. Hey, I'm OK with that, it's totally understandable. The menu has broad coverage with lots of healthy & tasty options. I'd rate the portions and cost as average but quality is very good. I find it impressive that they can please both vegan and meat-eating customers. This makes DWG good for larger parties with picky eaters. For meat-eaters, the brisket, ribs, chicken, cajun fish and pulled pork is all really tasty. The vegetable side dishes are equally good with interesting combos you don't often see. I'm not into vegan entree's so I can't comment on that.

The bar is really nice and has a wide range of craft beers. We were so delighted to see former employee \"Lisa the bartender\" return to DWG. I'm betting the owners & mgmt are also thankful she's back. Lisa is super upbeat, interacts with patrons and serves to liven up the establishment."}
{"text":"Had brunch on a Saturday morning. Atmosphere and service were great! The menu had a huge selection of great looking breakfast choices. I enjoyed the double wide eggs Benedict with a bowl of cheesy grits. Excellent. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"First time here..unbelievably good food....almost everything made from scratch...Jessica the server and Maria the manager were so welcoming and nice..lots of different foods you don't get at other restaurants...can't wait to bring my friends"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the Southside!  All around good food! Outdoor seating and plenty of drafts.  They have awesome mild wings, the BRIKET is great (if they have any left) in the summer.

+ cornhole outside when the wether is nice"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place to get wood fired BBQ. A converted gas station that offers inside and outside seating. Crowd is a great mix of locals and those traveling to the South Side for the evening.

I recommend the beef brisket. The coleslaw is tops and the spicy BBQ sauce is excellent.  Good wait staff, but hit and miss on their knowledge of beers, which can be disappointing as they have a very nice selection.

Great casual place to eat lunch on the weekends or hit it up before walking the streets of SS."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch today. I had the 1/2 rack of ribs, cheesey grits, cherry slaw, and corn bread. Everything was delicious. I took half of everything home the potions were so big. Staff was friendly and competent, decor is cool. What's not to like."}
{"text":"7Up pancakes review: light fluffy delicious. However, the pancakes come with no sides like whipped cream like the other pancake options do. I had to pay $1.5 for whipped cream (was on the check after) and another $1 to get canned fruit. So getting regular pancakes with your standard whipped cream cost $10. Pretty ridiculous considering. If you're not rolling with cash and don't mind paying a lot for pancakes, by all means get it because it is tasty."}
{"text":"Service is slow and the food was cold. Nice vibe. Probably a good place for drinks, but I don't recommend eating here. I had the tilapia tacos and my fiancé had the ribs. Took a while and came out cold."}
{"text":"Working in the Southside I get to frequent a lot of these establishments for lunch, so I do understand that the Double Wide caters more to the dinner and drinking crowd, at least I'm assuming this because the smell of beer still resonates when I eat there for lunch.  

If you want to have lunch in the Southside and you want to sit outside there aren't many options, so Double Wide might be your only choice.  If so stick to the salads as they are above average.  Everything I've ever tried apart from salads though has been a disappointment, and salads aren't what I'm normally trying to order (even though it probably should be).  If you sit inside though you will be greeted with a nice smell of stale beer that seems to have infested every inch of the place.  It's a shame too, because I do enjoy the layout and atmosphere.  If they just focused a little more on the quality and taste of the food I think this place would be amazing.  

My recommendation is to avoid unless you really want to sit outside."}
{"text":"Had a great supper experience at this relatively new (to Irwin) restaurant.  We loved the one on the Pgh South side, and this is no different.  Fast, friendly service and yummy food.  Had the pulled pork sandwich and unique sweet coleslaw with cherries.  Food was delicious, and the iced tea was perfect.  We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Not the kind of place I would really be crazy about coming back to.  We were walking around and decided to come in here just cause we were hungry and needed food or else we would probably die.  

Their menu is vast, there are lots of veggie options which is pretty cool if you're into that kind of thing.  I couldn't decide on a few items so I gave our server a choice and ordered what she suggested.  Wasn't super impressed, but it did it's job.

The mixed drink I got was SUPER sweet, but I guess that was to be expected.  Not bad if you're looking for the diner food experience."}
{"text":"Gets one star because I was actually seated. After that, no one approached me after I had been sitting there for 10 minutes. Got up and left and the same hostess told me to have a nice day. Don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"So, while I really, really do appreciate that DWG have more than a couple vegan options, I just haven't had anything great here. Nothing about this place is great and on top of that, it's kind of expensive! I did here that they opened up a section of their deck where you can bring dogs again, and because I love to bring my two furkids out into the world, I might give this place a fourth try... But it really is only so-so."}
{"text":"The Doublewide embodies a lot of conflicting emotions for me. 

PRO: I believe they have the greatest seitan wings & pulled seitan sandwiches in town - this can go a long way for a vegetarian. 
CON: I am decidedly uncomfortable with their version of \"Southern garage\" culture. Section 8 meals? Oh god. I'm actually from a place with Southern \"hick\" mechanics, and it is a little excruciating to see realities be turned into themes. 

PRO: Their beer draft lift is exciting, with a nice balance between old friends and new adventures. 
CON: The brunch is gross. Veggie menu options are slim and everything we ordered was just gross. Brunch is very important to me, almost sacred. 


The service is almost always fantastic, though, the servers are quick and knowledgeable. The food is solid & portions are manageable yet filling, but the seitan wings are a-mazing. I think the price point is a little high, but I guess it's alright to indulge in dressed-up down-home faves occasionally. The chairs and tables are big & sturdy, and the decor is some creative mash-up of a service station and a shiny corporate restaurant. 

Good place to take a date: It's not so loud you can't talk, and I've never been gay-bashed there or anything."}
{"text":"I came in here with my boyfriend during the Pinburgh tournament. We sat at the bar. It was relatively busy (dinner rush).

Our bartender, Lisa, is why I'm giving 5 stars. In spite of how busy it was, she repeatedly made it a point to let us know that she hadn't forgotten us. She served our drinks and food in a timely fashion, but was so mindful of our presence, and apologetic for what she felt was a long wait. In addition to that, once things calmed down a bit, she was very personable and went the extra mile to engage us in conversation.

The rest of the staff was also extraordinarily friendly!

Huge selection of food for fair prices, and the Chardonnay was satisfying. Crisp, with a nice bite.

I got the nachos, which were abundant and contained loads of fresh toppings. My boyfriend got a burger, which he describes as \"no frills, straightforward, exactly what I expected\".

I would come here again, because the food was of sizeable portions and tasty, and because the service felt personalized and friendly!"}
{"text":"Double wide in south side Pittsburgh should be ashamed to have their good name and reputation associated with this Irwin disaster. There's nothing about this location that is even somewhat acceptable for food service or dining. The staff that serves, seats, and interacts with customers is atrocious. The only way a staff could be this bad is from appalling management who is either too inexperienced to know how bad it really is, or is so arrogant that they don't even care.  The food came out luke warm, and sloppily put together. The servers can't remember any of your requests, and somehow they feel it's acceptable for a restaurant to charge you for dressings.  The prices for their menu items is outrageous, more so than the insipid taste. I could not recommend this place to anyone. Save your money, eat somewhere else. The experience was so bad I couldn't wait to get our of there, and I don't plan on coming back..."}
{"text":"Neat restaurant located in an old gas station/auto garage. The four of us sat outside under an umbrella for brunch. We ordered a black and blue burger, a trucker breakfast, the porker pancakes, the double wide eggs Benedict, ic d tea, and a bloody Mary. The portions were generous but not obscene. There were no survivors. Service was decent, and prices were fair."}
{"text":"I like coming to Double Wide on Tuesdays for all-you-can-eat pork ribs. It costs only $14.99 and comes with a side of fries. You can choose from the Carolina or Memphis sauce. Overall, tasty and a great value."}
{"text":"Not the typical place you'd expect to find lots of veggie options. By the looks of it, you'd expect at best to have a veggie burger as the lone non-meat option. But out of nowhere, Double Wide has an entire vegetarian and vegan menu! 

It's a unique mix of people there, but I guess that's to be expected when you're part sports bar, part biker bar, and part hipster vegetarian restaurant.

Lots of outdoor seating with picnic tables, delicious vegetarian options, and a huge beer menu. The Double Wide would be right at home in Austin, but it's on Carson Street. 

Five stars for sure."}
{"text":"Since I couldn't find the double-wide trailer that served food, I decided to stop here and was happy to discover that this converted body shop was not an actual double-wide but a restaurant. More to my enjoyment was that they served vegan food. I decided to have the Seitan Barbeque wings and my entrée was the TV Dinner (Barbeque sandwich, mixed veggies, French fries, veggie kabobs, and cole slaw). Yes, this was all vegan and I was drooling thinking about it. But as I've experience in the past looks and thoughts of a delicious meal can be deceiving--this meal was not the case. Everything was delicious and was the best TV dinner I've ever had, even when I was a bachelor and this was my nightly meal. 

Outside of the meal, the ambiance and service was great. We sat outside on the patio and experienced an amazing night of beautiful weather.

Would I go back? Heck to the veggie yes, and encourage any vegan, or vegetarian, to support this trendy establishment."}
{"text":"As a food critic from New York, I was excited to try some of the food my friends from Pittsburgh have been raving about. The first of many on my agenda was this place of business. Besides the fact that it took 23 minutes before a woman finally asked \"If we've been helped yet\", the service in general was shotty at best. I am from New York, so I am pretty desensitized to bad service, so that was not my issue. As someone whom consumes alcohol, maybe twice every 6 months, I can smell it from a mile away and it takes just a little, to make me feel hammered. I ordered a Pina Colada, with alcohol. My drink obviously had 0 alcohol in the beverage. I did not taste, smell nor feel a thing. When I NICELY asked the server about it, I was rebutted with an accusatory tone and a major attitude, with NO RESOLUTION. That ruined my entire meal. I was very nice about it, because I did not want to cause a scene, but I really wish I had not been so courteous to that uncouth maggot, you hire to serve hard working people, a meal they paid for. She did not deserve my respect, because she gave me, the patron, NONE. I have no clue how your food taste. My order was given to a buddy's 8 year old nephew. I'm sure his young palate enjoyed the ribs. I won't disclose the young serves name, because she clearly does not know any better and with that attitude, she'll need this gig for as long as she can keep it. She SUCKS and ruined my entire experience. I so regret being so nice. I will be back, but I'll be coming with buddies who have actual power in their pen, in this town. Thanks for the great introduction to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I'd been craving barbecue for weeks, so with a Groupon in tow, we headed out to Double Wide Grill on Saturday night to feed our bellies.

We got there around 7, and waited 10-15 minutes for a table.  It was nice weather, so we ambled up and down the block.  You can give the host your cell number so they call when your table is ready - it was very convenient and allowed us to take a walk instead of having to hover around the host stand.

We were seated inside at a booth, and we both got a kick out of the old-service-station decor.  Maybe \"decor\" isn't the right word, since this place actually WAS an old service station, it doesn't just look like one.  Several TVs were around the room, but the volume was quiet until the Penguins started playing.

They had a pretty cool selection of draft beer - my boyfriend was very impressed and got some unusual beer.  Can't remember what it was called but it was 9% alcohol, served in a smaller glass, and he enjoyed it immensely.  They were out of Blue Moon Pumpkin so I tried something from their Wheat section - I want to say it was Southampton something or other?  It was light and refreshing.

The boy got a full rack of ribs, and I got the brisket and pulled pork platter.  Both came with cornbread, slaw, a pickle, and fries - but I got their \"hub cap potatoes\" instead.  It was a TON of food!  We could not finish it between the two of us.  We took a whole half rack of ribs home because we were simply too stuffed to proceed.  Makes you wonder how the guy on \"Man vs. Food\" can do it.

So everything was pretty much \"okay\" in my book, although my boyfriend enjoyed everything a bit more than I did.  I found everything to be too salty - I was continually going to the coleslaw and my water glass to drown out the saltiness.  I wasn't a fan of the pulled pork - the barbecue sauce used was very vinegary and tangy in a somewhat unpleasant way. The brisket was better - juicy, and with a sauce that was more sweet.  Still, it didn't blow me away - pretty standard.  The ribs were just okay too, salty and without a lot of sauce.  The best part of ribs is licking sauce off your fingers, but there wasn't much to lick!  Also, the meat separated from the bones as soon as you pulled on them - the meat slipped off before we could even take a bite, so we didn't get the fun experience of holding up a meaty rib and nomming the meat off the bone.  We were left with just a plate of meat, which wasn't quite as fun to eat.  Cornbread was good, fries were addictive, and the \"hubcap potatoes\" were okay - nice garlic flavor.  Nothing was very hot (temperature), seemed like maybe the food had been sitting for a while.

Speaking of \"a while,\" service is very slow like everyone else says.  Our waiter was certainly friendly and pleasant, but we waited a long time to be greeted, a long time for our beers, and a very long time for our food.  Sounds like that's just the way it is here.

I was feeling sort of \"2 1/2 stars\" about the whole thing, but my boyfriend was so enthusiastic about the meal that I'll go ahead and give it a 3.  If you're craving barbecue it's a fine place to go to take the edge off, but it isn't the real deal."}
{"text":"We have tried double wide a few times and have finally given up. We have sat at the bar each time in and the service is awful. The bartenders act like they are doing us a favor to wait on us. They have their \"click\" that they wait on and talk to. If you are not in it you are lucky to get a drink.  We had a similar experience to another review when asking for a menu- they basically threw it at us. Menu was covered in some type of sludge similar to the slime from ghostbusters. Food was decent although overpriced. 1 star is mainly for consistent horrible service and filthy bar area."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Had the coconut chicken and fresh veggies. The chicken was grilled perfectly and the coconut sauce was light and not at all overpowering. I'd like to try the BBQ next time as I think this is their real specially. Overall a fun place with good food."}
{"text":"The separate vegetarian and vegan menu is awesome. I have tried almost everything vegan and it is delicious. I am obsessed with the lentil burger. The service is amazing and I am never waiting long for my food even during the busiest hours. Must try!!!"}
{"text":"Crazy friendly service, TONS of outdoor seating and the BEST breakfast burrito. WHOA. Everything good."}
{"text":"Incredible. Plenty of choices for vegans and vegetarians. Even choices for carnivores. I had the veggie Philly cheesesteak sandwich. Great and filling. They even have a separate fryer just for vegans.
Service? Never had better. A must when visiting Pittsburgh, only wish there was one in a Southern California."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday Brunch. Walked in around 1:40 and they said they stopped serving brunch for the day already, meanwhile the table next to us ordered it after we arrived. The waiter seemed to have little to no personality. I had to ask for a water around 6 times before I got one. He also knew very little about the menu and cocktails. It seemed like a great environment but sadly didn't get to experience it."}
{"text":"I ate here a second time when I was in town. It's just so good! Those hubcap potatoes are amazing. I would eat those all the time if I lived in Pittsburgh. AND they have Lindemann's Lambic Framboise on tap!? $6 a glass, but still, that's awesome! Our waitress was one of the managers. What a trip! :)"}
{"text":"I've been here 2 times now and really haven't been impressed with this place at all. I tried really hard to like it since it's my friend's favorite restaurant, but just haven't enjoyed any of the food. I tried a fish dish here the first time (wish I could remember exactly what it was) and the most recent trip I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich which was decent but definitely not impressive. If it were up to me I wouldn't choose to go back, but my friends love it.

Why they love it - a couple reasons, it does have a good vegan/vegetarian menu (clearly I don't fall in that category based on my menu choices above) but they said its really good for vegans/vegetarians. Also, they have the outside patio which is nice for dogs!

Overall it's a good atmosphere, but I just don't like the food."}
{"text":"I will start with saying I am a little biased of Double Wide because they have a specific outdoor patio where you can bring your dog. Not only can you bring your dog but they even have a Doggy menu for your fur baby! How cute! You can pretty much guarantee when it is nice out your furry friend will be having as much fun as you are while making other buddies on the patio.

Next, they have THE BEST drinks ever. The frozen mojito is honestly the best alcoholic beverage I have ever had. Get one and forever have your life changed.

Now onto the food. This can be hit or miss. I luckily have always had very good food, but my husbands choices have struggled. They are known for having a ton of vegan/vegetarian options which is awesome. I personally love their chicken dishes. The wood fired chicken options are just SO GOOD. Usually I go with the wood fire chicken sandwich, but today I opted with a different option and wow am I glad I did. I had a pineapple salsa chicken wrap with hot sauce. The flavors complimented each other perfectly. They also have homemade fries and about 10 different side options. Today I had the fruit cup.

Double wide will be a place I continue to go to on a normal basis in the summer with my husband & pup and you should to!"}
{"text":"LOVED Double Wide.

My grandfather passed away last April, but I know that as a car mechanic he would have loved this place, as it was a car garage turned restaurant. The atmosphere is fantastic, with great memorabilia on the walls, and even garage doors that open into the outdoor seating area when it's nice out!

The food was fantastic and the portions were great, in my opinion. Lots of food for a reasonable price, but not so much that I felt too full afterwards. I got the pulled pork (on one of their \"trays\" I believe) and it tasted great. Definitely a great place to come with family and friends. I really want to eat outside sometime when the weather is warmer."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that there are a lot of chairs. This is the sole reason for a four star review instead of a five star review. They were slightly too tall and a shorter person may not have been able to have their feet touch the floor. I am not short, and my feet firmly touched the floor, but I worry for my short friends and family who may have their legs dangling while they eat. This could be quite a displeasure. What I do like about the chairs is that you can use the posts for a temporary cup holster in an emergency situation. Very handy! The padding on the chairs are mediocre at best and left my buttocks slightly asleep during and shortly after my meal. Along with these minor grievances the chairs are too heavy for the average human, which leads me to believe these chairs quite possibly weren't made for human beings. Just a thought. All in all, good food. Horrible chairs. Great atmosphere.

(P.S. The booths looks more comfortable)"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. So glad to see a vegetarian friendly restaurant in this area. Try the seitan wings!  Staff are friendly and attentive and wait times low."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and I want to like it more than I do. I like the patio seating which is nice but I think that is all I really like. They even have a special patio area where you can bring your dog and eat! Service, prices and overall experience is adequate but not spectacular. The food is average but I've never had a fabulous meal here. I'd come here again if someone wanted to because you can get a decent meal but I would likely not choose it on my own."}
{"text":"Excellent food and attentive service!  First time here but I will be back.  Tried the wings, the ribs, the pulled pork - all excellent, especially the ribs! They fall off the bone, not fatty, tender, flavorful!! I LOVE the Carolina BBQ sauce!!! The sides were great too.  I had the creamy cherry cole slaw, cheesy grits, sweet potato fries and yummy cornbread - all delicious.  It is a fun automotive theme atmosphere.   We came here with about 20 people and they did a great job for us!  Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"If it's a nice night and you don't have enough wait staff.  Don't seat every table.  We waited 15 minutes before someone said is anyone helping you and said would be back.  5 minutes later we leave the table. 

Ok go to bar.  Maybe get service there. Yes we're hungry and already there.   Wrong.  Bar tender only serving wait staff.  Only when we get up to leave at 5 minutes he says do we want something.  Nope not anymore."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on a Saturday morning and the place was deserted. Which I actually liked because we basically had the place to ourselves. Good food, large space and a very relaxed atmosphere. We had the typical brunch food - omelettes and pancakes - services was fast and good! It's nice knowing you can go in sweatpants and not be judged. We'll def be back!"}
{"text":"We chose this on a whim. Should have kept driving! Fun atmosphere, enticing menu. Too bad the food did not impress us. I ordered the salmon tacos. The menu said it came with red pepper rice and  garlic Cole slaw. I was asked if I wanted sour cream or Pico di Gallo . I said yes to the Pico. If there was 3 oz of salmon in two tacos, I would be surprised. There was no rice or Cole slaw, but I did get fries. The price was 12 or 13 dollars and not worth it. They could have easily doubled the salmon they gave and still made money on this dish. Extra charge for  about 2 tablespoons of Pico too. The only good thing was the wheat beer. My friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich. Her fries were cold. The waitress did bring hot ones when we told her about them. Overall, just middle of the road. Paying for the cool factor here and not for good food. Waitress was nice and efficient, however."}
{"text":"This is the review of the dog patio. Yes, they have a dog patio. There's a few basic rules, but the awesomeness of having lunch with your pooch far outshines it. Nice patio and ADORABLE doggy menu. Our dog prefers the chicken breast. All in all, our best double wide experience yet. Oh, and the people food is delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a bite; particularly when you can sit outside.  The food would be best described, to me anyway, as an upscale bar menu.  The Vegitarian and Vegan items are a nice option as my daughter is a vegitarian and it allows us to all have good food in a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I met a friend and her family for lunch at Double Wide. They got their first and decided to sit outside. . It was almost 90 degrees. Our waitress was great and kept refilling our drinks. I kept it simple and ordered a cheeseburger and a cup of fruit. I ordered the burger medium. When my burger cam there was a very thin line of pink and it was only a degree or two from being well done. If you've read my reviews you know my belief is basic menu items should be cooked perfectly. That's the foundation of every plate you make. I was very bummed that my burger was overcooked. It is rare that I send food back. I usually just cross it off my list of places to go. Consider this one 'd off."}
{"text":"One word describes this experience-DRY!  The ribs, chicken, and brisket were all very dry. It took a lot of sauce to get them to go down. The cornbread was almost burnt on the bottom and it was also dry. Save time & money and skip this place."}
{"text":"We always enjoy what Double Wide has to offer.  Endless rib night, good beers, a section to sit with your dog...they have it all!  In the summer the outside seating is perfect for people watching while you dine and the inside is cozy when it's a tad too chilly to be in the elements."}
{"text":"Tilapia tacos rule"}
{"text":"Double wide is a southside staple! I ate here when I first moved to the city in 2010 and I continue to come here regularly for happy hour and simmer day drinking. There is always available outdoor seating and there are healthy options on the menu so it's not just \"bar food\". Karaoke night is also a huge plus. That and the fact that people are allowed to bring their dogs to the outside patio."}

istle.  Two types of Cole slaw, cherry and garlic/vinegar.  Cherry was very bland, but inoffensive.  Garlic was WAY too vinegary...pucker up buttercup...wow.  Even the Iced Tea was watery and flavorless.  Staff was friendly and attentive, not their fault.  All in all, best thing we had was the Reuben Roll appetizer...THOSE were very good.  Crossed this one off the list of places to try....won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has a good vibe and a large outside seating area.  Our server was really nice and service was fast. The problem is with the food. The server told us the veggie of the day was broccoli and carrots that were cooked in wine and very flavorful. They were not that at all. Very bland and soggy. The rest of the food our table had was not that good either. Pulled pork was dry and flavorless. The onion rings and wings were good at least."}
{"text":"The prices blew me away...The service is OK, the cost to eat the simplest things was truly too much. I appreciate the selections of craft beers but the prices are the highest per glass than anyplace locally at the moment. The food was \"OK\" the Git Er Done plate was the choice...I dont know if something else would have been better. I know we spent A LOT of money on mediocre meals."}
{"text":"Had a pretty mediocre breakfast here today. The 'side' of home fry potatoes on my plate and my son's consisted of 6 pieces of new potatoes. I thought it was just a garnish. The eggs Benedict were pretty good though. 

I brought it to the attention of the server who said I could go talk to the manager. If the server actually cared, she'd bring the manager to me."}
{"text":"I have had a few good meals at the south side location, but felt the last few were not so great. Tried the one here in Irwin today, and was even less impressed. Ordered a burger when the place was empty. Took over 20 minutes. I ordered in done medium, it came out cooked grey all the way trough and crispy, well done. Asked for another, it came out rare and red. 

Not impressed at all. They have good menu, but they are dropping their game..."}
{"text":"Groupon is bad news when all is said and done. The manager made me whole monetarily but the experience made me angry, and that ruined the evening.  I responded to an ad for a $20 groupon and wound up buying a $40 Groupon accidentally. I didn't even realize it was an option until it was too late. Well, a $40 groupon will work when I take my family but tonight it'll just be us two so I went ahead and also bought the $20.  Turns out, three of us went so I expected to use the $40 Groupon after all. When I went to redeem it, the waitress said oh the fine print says for four people and you only have three.  Nevermind that we had over $50 in food between the three of us (and adding alcohol we were just shy of $80.) I didn't want the $40 Groupon to begin with and felt tricked into purchasing it, and now the waitress is telling me I am violating the small print, but I could use a $20 groupon. (Now, why would she think I might have both?). And she kept going on and on about it and finally I told her to stop! Just stop talking. I was angry now, the night was ruined at this point feeling that I had been swindled and I simply wanted to leave.  By this time they had both of my groupon numbers and I clicked redeem on the $20 one. Apparently she let the manager know I was not happy and he said they can use the $40 groupon after all.  But now both groupons show redeemed so to make up for it they gave me a $20 gift card. (And I tipped based on the $80 sale even though the waitress could have prevented the whole episode.)  So ok, yeah, I am not out anything moneywise.  But the experience was infuriating and not one I want to repeat.  I won't remember my meal in a couple months but I will always remember this terrible Groupon experience at Double Wide.  
Groupon just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"I've been a longtime fan of Double Wide, and have eaten at the Southside and Mars locations for years.  When I saw a location was opening in at the old Teddy's location, I was really excited.  Greensburg/Irwin is littered with sub-par national chains and there aren't a lot of good local dining options in the area.

I took my parents to Double Wide on a visit, and it quickly became clear that Double Wide just wasn't a good fit for the area.  The two things I love the most about Double Wide - the playful irony of the menu and the wide selection of vegetarian options - were completely lost on this customer base.  Within seconds of being seated, the waitress came over and almost apologetically told us not to even worry about the last two pages of the menu because those were vegetarian.  She seemed a little shocked when I explained that I came to Double Wide BECAUSE of the vegetarian menu.

The food was good, though maybe a slight tick below the quality I've come to expect from the other locations.  But the overall charm and tone that Double Wide has at the other locations wasn't there.  It just felt flat, and like they were trying too hard to be like Texas Roadhouse or Applebee's, when the appeal has always been that Double Wide is quite the opposite in a tongue in cheek way."}
{"text":"I am not really sure why this place has such high reviews. 

So a few years ago we tried this place - it looks great from the outside and as we quickly discovered - terrible for the food. Fast forward to 2013 and my husband suggests we try it out again... I protest and he wins out. The food... again... not so awesome. 

the good: the service is great. Our waitress was just the right amount of attentive, friendly and efficient. Lacey is why this review has two stars instead of one. I also liked how the kids menu offered a mix and match of items and included fresh, raw carrots in addition to the veggie of the day and the usual suspects of fries. My daughter had the carrots and the grilled cheese and then a cookie we decided to wrap up fro later... she was happy. 

My husband was content his grilled cheese with bacon sandwich - with a side of fries. 

The bad: I had the pulled pork sandwich with the lug nuts (upcharge) on the side. First, the sandwich was served open face with no sauce on the pork. There was a strange serving of something that looked suspiciously like duck sauce on the side and was very spicy... not something I would pair with pulled pork. I decided not to use it and took a bite of the naked pork - it had like zero seasoning on it. yuck. we asked for BBQ sauce which - when added -  improved the flavor but it was pretty meh.. I have made much better in a crockpot at home. Plus... mixed in with the tender bits were a number of pieces that were not braised enough - chewy and tough - sinewy even. I picked those pieces out since I decided to eat it with a knife and fork instead of as a sandwich. 

Now the lug nuts looked interesting on the menu - garlic and herb potatoes... yeah, garlic - I can totally get behind that! um, the reality was what appeared to be deep fried chunks of potatoes that were fried in grease that does not taste like it was changed in quite some time. it had an off flavor to it and the garlic and herb sauce was terrible - strong flavor that ruined you for really any thing else. After a second bite with the sauce scraped off I asked for fries instead - again, Lacy was gracious and took care of me... the fries were ok - again, tasted like they were fried in old grease but it was tolerable. 

I think this is it for me with the Double Wide Grill. I don't care how great it looks from the outside or how popular it seems to be. It really makes me question how discerning people can be to think it is great food and go back again and again. about 10 minutes after leaving heartburn set in and now a couple of hours later I still feel slightly sick to my stomach. No third chances... avoid at all costs. but should you decide to try it out - hopefully Lacy is your waitress."}
{"text":"SO MANY VEGAN/VEGETARIAN OPTIONS!! I love this place so much because they have FULL PAGES dedicated to meatless food and a lot of it is soul food, which isn't easy to find for plant based eaters. I usually go on Wednesdays & get seitan wings. My favorite are the garlic parmesan wings, but I like the honey garlic ones too. I'm always weary about ordering anything with Portobello mushrooms because a lot of times they marinate them too long or something & they end up tasting like straight vinegar. It's just really nice to go to a homestyle restaurant & not have to get a simple salad or side dishes."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate there last Friday night, around 8:30pm. After reading the reviews, wasn't expecting much from the waiters, but was expecting a good meal.
We started out with the chicken egg rolls. I absolutely did not like them. Tasted like spicy mush inside of an egg roll shell. The sauce was the look and consistency of duck sauce, but pretty tasteless to me. My boyfriend really liked them, though. 
I ordered the tilapia, cajun style, with broccoli and mashed potatoes. What I got was a small, over-cooked piece of fish and undercooked vegetables. The mashed potatoes were decent (how can you mess that up?).  I left feeling hungry and cheated. $15 for a piece of fish that was smaller than my palm?
My boyfriend ordered a steak and veggies. The veggies were also undercooked, and the steak was gristly. The middle of his mashed potatoes were cold. 
For a $50 meal, we were expecting a lot more. Definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"This review is on the service (or lack there of) received Saturday. Double (why)ide on Earth would i ever come back? My boyfriend and I drove to the Southside after a long day of hiking, specifically for this establishment; we heard the food was good, though we've never been. We show up at 3:40 PM, in between lunch and dinner hours, not busy, no reason for the service we were dealt. We walk up to the host stand, wait around for a few minutes as 2 employees walk past- not a single word, nor smile, no \"someone will be right with you\". Someone finally comes along to seat us. Menus were filthy, seat had left over food on it, but it was okay we we're starving and excited anyways. 

After looking over the menu, and seeing about 3 servers walk past, amongst other employees fiddling their thumbs, we looked at the clock and realized it was 4 pm. That it's been 20 minutes of absolutely NO service. No greeting, no drinks, not even water...0 acknowledgement whatsoever. We said what the heck? We decided to wait 5 more minutes, because we've both worked in the restaurant business before, we understand stuff happens. So 5 more minutes...Nothing. I saw another table seated near us get up and ask for the check because they never even got their drinks.. they were already sitting when we arrived 25 minutes ago. I really hate to give negative reviews but this was the poorest excuse of restaurant service I've ever experienced. 

We went to Fat Heads instead, got seated right away and greeted/fed right away. Who knows how long we would have been sitting before even being greeted? Sad I didn't get to try your turkey burger, probably won't be back."}
{"text":"After a couple of visits, I have to say I do enjoy this place!  The first time we went it was blazing hot and we were there with a largish group.....including a very well-behaved puppy.  They actually have a special outdoor place for the pooches to hang with their owners, but (and I'm sure this is for sanitary reasons) the servers can't actually enter that area so it makes the service a little disjointed.  That, and it was blazing hot, made it a little awkward.  But then the food, oooooh, the food!  They have an impressive vegan offering, and so many fun combinations....I ended up with a yummy chicken sandwich and the cheesy rice balls, and sweet potato fries.  It was one of those times I ate so much it was uncomfortable....but oh so worth it!  Plus, for the gluten free they do take care of you, too, so definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch. Hungover, sitting at the bar. I figured I'd trudge through the meal and then make my way back home to relax. 

However, our bartender Lisa brightened the day. She herself was coming off a rough night as well, but had us laughing the entire time. She jokingly harassed the two of us for being camels and drinking all their water, but quickly wised up and gave us a pitcher of water. At one point, there were ice balls being made in the blender and being tossed around the bar. 

For food I got a Carnivore Omelet, which was good, but nothing to rave about. Our experience was completely made by our bartender Lisa (and the 3 great Bloody Mary's she made each of us). We headed out refreshed and much happier than we went in."}
{"text":"Just in Pittsburgh for about 24 hours for work. Helped vegan and decided to give this place a try. Main reason why we decided to try it was because it not only had vegan options for me, but also \"normal\" options for me meat eating boyfriend. We walked up and the place was PACKED, which only gave us a good sign that it was worth it. The wait was about 45-55 minutes, but the food came out so fast that it evened out. I got the vegan BBQ saitan bites and I should have gotten like 3 orders they were AMAZING and I was very happy with them. My boyfriend said his pulled pork sandwich was also very very good. If I'm ever back, this place is where I'm going!"}
{"text":"The menu has a nice variety. Plenty of BBQ, burgers, sandwiches, and pasta. We asked for some hot wings. Delicious. Good seasoned flavor with some kick. On to the main courses. Ribs were way overcooked. Seared all over and crunchy around the ends. Centers dried out. The burger was lost on the bun. If you're charging more than $10 on a burger at least make a patty big enough to fit the bun. Pulled pork and the corn bread was average. 
Service started out great with the waitress checking frequently. However, halfway through the meal our glasses sat empty. The service was good enough to bring me back, the food definitely was not."}
{"text":"Four stars for one reason: vegetarian selection. This is not great food, if you're a foodie or used to more selection offered in metropolitan areas. However, if you find yourself in Western PA and you don't eat meat, this will be your favorite place. Two full pages of vegan and vegetarian options, plus seafood, its the best selection you're going to get around this area without driving into Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Will not be going back. Too expensive and had cold unseasoned pull pork. Wish there was actually a good barbecue around here."}
{"text":"On our way out of town we stopped by Doublewide to check out their brunch. I can sum up our experience in one word- \"overrated\". This place wasn't terrible and the service was pretty good but I can't say the food was that delicious or memorable. It was quite pricey for the amount you received and when the food doesn't taste that good it is hard to justify a $40 breakfast for 2."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  The food is great, and the beer selection is very good.  It tends to get a little pricey, and given its South Side location it's not uncommon to have a bunch of somewhat rowdy college kids here and there.  Double Wide is great for groups with a wide range of dietary preferences, including vegan food and traditional (i.e. meat) BBQ.  There's something for everyone here!"}
{"text":"My first visit to the Double Wide.  Simple Friday night - Steak, Pepper & Bacon Salad with a side of Sweet Potato Fries.

Two strikes on the salad:  Grasshopper pee on the lettuce (what we thought dead, wilted, brown leaves were when we were kids); and balsamic dressing that looks like brown gravy.  Um, yuk.  I will say that the steak, peppers and bacon were fine.

Sweet potato fries were angel-singing fabulous.  I requested bleu cheese, but the server suggested their sugar-cinammon dip and it was terrific.  She was so right.  Loved it.

The service was excellent: happy, helpful & quick.

I might go back for the outdoor opportunity, but otherwise there's just no draw.

Another thing that made me chuckle - they weren't really busy but there were two guys handling the greeting and seating chart.  It looked like they were studying for an exam.  ...maybe they were and I'm being harsh..."}
{"text":"Awful food, awful service. 
After having a bad experience at their location in South Side, we opted to give the new Irwin location a try. It was no better...in fact, it was worse.
My meal was fine - I ordered a cheeseburger and fries. Simple, easy, nearly impossible to mess up.
My boyfriend ordered a steak medium-rare, with rice and beans for sides. This is where the problem arose.
A charred piece of meat that looked as though it had been run over by a car (it was that flattened) was placed in front of him, and before he could cut into it our server was off to another table. After cutting into the middle and seeing what he already knew, that it was well done, he attempted to flag our server down. When she made it over 5 minutes later, she offered to have a new steak cooked, but advised that it may take awhile since they were busy. He's fairly easy to please, so he said he would just eat the steak that he had and asked for some steak sauce.
15 minutes later, as we watched our server bring beers to our neighboring table and no steak sauce to us, he finally ate his overly done steak, with no sauce. Our server finally came back around...still no steak sauce. She had seemingly forgotten that he had even asked for it. She dropped the bill and was again gone in an instant.
After waiting for 10 minutes for her to come back to take our payment, we got frustrated and went to the bar to pay. 
All in all, both experiences we've had at DWG have been a let down. The food is below sub-par, and the service at both locations was lacking.
As much as we wanted to love this place, we'll leave it."}
{"text":"This place was aggressively medium. The vegan wings were fine, the vegan \"cheesesteak\" was fine but way too sweet. The non vegans I ate with all said their food was bad to average."}
{"text":"Love, love , LOVE the lentil burger! I suggest that you get with a mayo or some other sauce and tomato and lettuce however as it has a tendency to be a bit dry,especially if you plan on taking some home for leftovers. Another 4-5 star choice is the vegetarian chili. I immediately ordered it with sour cream and cheddar cheese and it was delicious (only because I have a very delicate stomach for spicy foods). My goal in life is to hunt down these recipes! The fries are delicious, I always ask for them to be done well done, it's a habit of mine every where I go, especially at Eat 'n Park (my pet peeve there) and they do not disappoint."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and have been impressed each time. As others have remarked, the Seitan wings are out of this world. We split the sauces - barbeque and hot - both really extraordinary and the texture of the Seitan is, well, like meat. The onion rings are also amazing. They got the breading just right - it sticks to the onion so you don't end up pulling the onion out of the breading by accident. The rings come with a really tasty  chipotle ranch sauce with a lot of flavor and a little kick.

And then there's the beer. They rotate their selection frequently so you never know what you're going to get. That ends up being half the fun. The staff have been reliable at providing advice in this realm. But with a name like Uppity Jag Off IPA, ya have to try it, right? I loved it. Not too hoppy as IPA's go....very tasty with the added benefit that it's difficult to forget the name.

Great place!"}
{"text":"When the weather's nice and I visit the bros in PGH, Double Wide is my bar of choice. It's a great place to just kick back and relax, sit outside, play some cornhole, and enjoy some adult beverages. 

The food was very forgettable but that's really not why you we went there. We actually ended up ordering a pizza to be delivered there and they let us eat it which I thought was pretty cool. 

And there are a lot of dollar drink specials on the SS but this is not one of them. Over the course of a day I think I spent the equivalent of an actual double wide but I had such a good time there that I didn't really mind. 

With some upcoming events in the Burgh this summer I'm sure we'll be hitting up the Double Wide for the clean Burgh air and some Iron Citys'."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place for its vegan options: kudos,  Irwin, PA! I got a starter of the seitan wings with the sweet and tangy sauce and it was very yummy! However, my main course of the lentil burger was a bit dry, and I didn't make it all the way through. My husband had the ribs, which he said were very well smoked and tender, though a bit fatty. Great fries (sweet potato and shoe string). Good and speedy service, despite the reviews I read, though I wish the wait staff would be a little more eco friendly, and just refill your glass, rather than bring you an entire new glass with each refill. So mostly good review, but a bit disappointed with the burger."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch and I really wanted to like this place - the online menu sounded great! What we got was mediocre at best and disappointing at worst: small portions, lack of flavor and overpriced. The eggs Benedict barely had any hollandaise on it, the eggs were overcooked and the potatoes were a mix of overdone and underdone. The \"fruit wedge\" was a sad sliver of flavorless cantaloupe. The burrito came 3/4 full with barely any meat or veggies and topped with \"pico de gallo\" which, in reality, is clearly bottled salsa. Once again the potatoes ranged from \"still crunchy\" to \"this is going to need dental records to identify\".  Wouldn't recommend this place, and the fact that there were only four people here on a Saturday morning is testament to this."}
{"text":"Double Wide Grill is a surprising place to find vegan options, but I was more than happy with my findings. I went in and tried the lentil burger and fries as well as an order of seitan buffalo wings. My two friends ordered what I believe were vegetarian dishes - a portobello burger and some type of hearty chili. 

For a place that sells bar-like junk food, my lentil burger was certainly healthy. It tasted healthy. I wouldn't order it again because it was too healthy for a restaurant meal, and when I eat out, I like to indulge a little. Either way, I recognize its value as a good menu option and it is definitely a great choice for someone who wants to eat healthier when they eat out. 

The seitan wings were interesting. The restaurant obviously doesn't specialize in vegan food, but they had a unique texture and flavor I have never experienced with seitan before. That's a GOOD thing. 

The chili my friend had was also amazing. It was filling, nutritious and flavorful. 

Prices are great for the portion sizes, and our server was incredible. She was very helpful in helping us choose items, and she brought refills promptly. 

I look forward to returning to Double Wide Grill and trying some of the other vegan items on the menu. It's a fun atmosphere even though we went while it was quiet. I would love to go here again during the night and have drinks."}
{"text":"Tried a sizzler steak with veggies and fruit. Steak tasted like propane. Like they just started the grill. Horrible. My wife had the tired mahi mahi it was dried out. Realize this isn't a 4 star restaurant but food quality was still a zero

Don't bother with this place"}
{"text":"Loved the frozen mojito and the frozen margarita as well. Special Philly cheesesteak with nacho cheese was pretty damn good too. Great seating on a sunny day and a wide variety of selections on the menu. Plenty of veggie and vegan options as well. Nice that it's a little farther down the line on Carson than some of the other busy restaurants."}
{"text":"As I was in town strictly to imbibe, I didn't have chance to try the food at the Double Wide, but the restaurant was a spectacle by itself. The renovated service station motif was executed brilliantly, with no detail spared. Drinks were awesome, and we were happy to have the opportunity to enjoy the sunshine a little as there were many other places within walking distance that weren't able to offer outdoor seating. We went up and down the cocktail menu and thoroughly enjoyed everything that we were fortunate enough to sample. Some of the signatures, such as the highly advertised frozen mojito, didn't pack too much of a punch, but whatever. The wait staff was very attentive and kind, and prices weren't out of control. Great spot at which to waste an afternoon."}
{"text":"Double Wide Grill is like an abusive relationship: you keep telling yourself that the last time will indeed be the last time. The last time you eat their terrible food, the last time you put up with their absolutely atrocious service, the last time you put up with their usuals, who they only pay attention to, that may be brain damaged and do nothing but scream the same three things across the bar. Well I'm wising up. No more, Double Wide Grill. No more."}
{"text":"Awesome Vegan options. 2 whole pages to choose from. Separate frier for fries. In an old Texaco station. Great scenery."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday night and had a 20 minute wait for a table so we had a drink at the bar. Beer selection was good. Once seated we ordered and unfortunately waited 40 minutes for our food. The waitress did check on us a couple times and apologized for the delay saying the kitchen was really backed up. Food was okay but nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to eating their vegetarian food.  Unfortunately the food was bland and tasteless.  White bean taco was nothing and the sides of red beans/rice and white beans (mashed to look like mashed potatoes) were disappointing in every way.  My friend had a portabello mushroom reuben which was only saved by the marble rye bread.  Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Ok, I was at Vegan fest out of town and had Seitan wings from these guys and was hooked. Also, the rep at the event told us about the dog patio and we had to go see for ourselves. 

I would say the dog patio is great if your dog isn't a total little jerk..we have a couple dogs that did ok but it IS a bit stressful. You also have to kind of serve yourself but it's worth it to keep the fur babies along. Everyone on the patio was super friendly too. 

Great happy staff etc...

We went back to try out another meal inside at night but unfortunately it was a little sloppy/bleh. I think there are just too many items on the menu to keep them perfected. 

It is a huge option for vegans though so we will not write it off, just hope that the quality improves because I could see us being regulars if it did."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch often. Every time we go we get great service and have good food. The atmosphere is really cool and the prices are great. I don't think it's amazing but I've never had a bad experience. Sometimes some of the food doesn't measure up, I would avoid the mashed potatoes. The burgers and sandwiches are great."}

Once again, I was having difficulty choosing a restaurant. Dad doesn't like to go out to eat and insisted on getting takeout from a place relatively close to home. After mulling it over all day, I chose Double Wide Grill for 3 reasons 1) It's controversial, and I just hadda see what the hub-bub was about. 2) I'd been craving BBQ, and it became too late to order from Yinzburgh, my original choice, and Bloomfield would have been too far; Dad didn't wanna cross the Monongahela.

A business trip to Pitt will not be complete for me again without a stop at one of my new favorite restaurants. BTW: the menu is overwhelming with choices and the vegan selections are phenom."}
{"text":"Dbl Wide is a great hangout due to their food and drinks but also because they are in the heart of South Side. Been going there for years and I always have a great meal and enjoyable time."}
{"text":"Fun place for a group.  Stopped to watch some football and fill the belly.
Couldn't wait to get the Brisket Sandwich.  Oh, not available till after 4...eh on a weekend with people watching football...how come so late.  

Asked if any beer specials.  No!  How come, everyone else on Carson St. have beer specials during the game...just left a place with a special.  Proceed to order and when we were almost done the waitress said do you want that or the all U can eat, it is less $'s and more to eat.  If you have it a special, why not tell us before we order?

Anyway, the ribs and nachos and corn bread were enjoyable."}
{"text":"The food looks promising. It never seems to deliver on taste though. The staff always seems to be confused too. It's a great location though, and the people viewing is unmatched on the Southside."}
{"text":"Food Was just ok. Salt and pepper, perhaps the kitchen manager could introduce the cooks to these two kitchen items. Omg the noise from clanging plates was so loud. The waiter was kind and effective."}
{"text":"Terrible service, came here on a Sunday and the staff was so unhelpful it was almost unreal they literally had 50 tables available didn't want to seat us told us to get a seat at the bar which had no seats purely don't like this place for the staff and their lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Brunch starts at 10 AM on the weekends. I had cream cheese stuffed French toast. Wonderfully delicious and a great portion size. Served with hot syrup and potatoes. My husband had the Black and Bleu Burger that was seasoned with blackening spices and covered with melted Bleu cheese crumbles. Had I not been in a breakfast mood, I definitely would have tried one of their make-your-own TV dinners.

Not that it appealed to me, but they have a lot of vegan/vegetarian options here. 

Minus one star for incorrect operating hours posted on their website... Unless I missed them. I will check again and update to 5 stars if I'm mistaken."}
{"text":"Ordered their Monday special, chicken quesadilla which comes with a side salad for $10.99.
VERY well done dish!  Compliments to the chef, I must admit I come here often because of meetings and never really know what to order because its all been \"ok\" but not \"GOOD\".  This is the first dish I have ordered that I felt was good enough to go out of my way to come back for!!!

Please put it on the regular menu!  The quesadilla had just the right amount of crispiness and was fully of flavor.  I had a side of BBQ sauce which made it just right for me.  Be warned, its a BIG portion which was awesome but it can be finished.  For two lighter eaters, could easily share it and still both be full."}
{"text":"I love this place for a casual dinner or a brunch door to hit every pallet, my friends love burgers and i love the vegan options!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the WORST service and food I have ever had. No one greets you, you wait 15-20 min before they even give you a menu. Had brunch today and that's the last time I'll ever go, I gave them multiple chances. Got double wide eggs Benedict, and the eggs were not even remotely cooked. The yolk turned my plate into soup, and ruined everything else on the plate. Bartender admitted to being very hungover. Didn't prepare Bloody Mary properly. Don't waste your time here when there are so many other good places to eat on carson."}
{"text":"If you crave beer in a warm glass , food devoid of flavor and service without notice this is your new spot.   Bartenders are a mess and their questionable friends don't pay for drinks .  Live entertainment was a supposed to be music and was more of a comedy.  Manager came out twice and took no notice of situation and had slight nod to the dealer at bar to meet him out back.  I'm going to say over and under of this place is Easter."}
{"text":"This was the first real meal sit down meal on our recent trip to Pittsburgh. We were thrilled to discover that Double Wide Grill had lots of vegetarian/vegan options and was just a short walk from the Holiday Inn Express we were staying at.

Double Wide Grill is a fun diner style restaurant with a car/gas station theme. There was a beer chandelier directly above our table. I didn't get a photo of the outside of the restaurant, but it had a nice outdoor area where dogs can hang out too!

We ordered a full order of the seitan wings ($9.79) with Cletus' signature hot sauce. It also came with ranch dressing and some veggies. This was quality seitan. Very tender. We gobbled it up really quickly. I'm not one to shy away from junk food, especially when I'm on vacation. 

We also shared the BBQ Pulled Seitan ($9.29), which was delicious! The multi grain vegan bread was perfect with the seitan. It wasn't stringy like pulled pork, but was sliced into thin, tender strips and had a good texture. Good stuff.

For beer, I got the Thirsty Dog Old Leghumper. It was a tasty American Porter that paired well with all the seitan, but let's be honest, I clearly ordered it just so I could say that I've had a beer called Leghumper!"}
{"text":"The outdoor seating is great, really get to see all the sights of the South Side. I ordered a cheese burger which was excellent, 1 of the best burgers I ever had. Came with a side of fries which were pretty good but wish they would of gave me more.  My wife had the cooked vegetable and Brie salad and added grilled BBQ chicken.  She said it was also really good. Other than not getting enough fries the 6 blue moon beers we had were a bit expensive ($33). They have a huge extensive menu and can't wait to go back and try something different."}
{"text":"The Double Wide Grill is another iteration of your typical American restaurant. It was a good stop for our large group on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. I looked like they had a bar area that was somewhat separated from the more family friendly dining area we were at. They also have outdoor seating for the warmer months. It sounds like one of their locations is pretty neat and has some camper trailers integrated into the restaurant to give it a unique theme, but we didn't see any of that here.

The menu isn't anything too special, but is very large and has something for everybody. When we were there, they had their regular lunch menu on top of a special brunch menu. Both were large on their own, but the options seemed to run the entire gamut when you combined them. I can't help but think of how long food items sit in a freezer before they are cooked for a place with that many options, so I usually just stick with something simple and got the wings. They fall pretty low on the hierarchy of wings I have had at places like this, and aren't something I would get again. I don't think anybody was too impressed with their meals, but there was a lot of food for a relatively good price.

The thing that stood out to me here was their large draft list. They had a great list of local craft beers, including some special seasonal choices. That beer list is probably what would get me back in here. Our waitress was good, especially with our large group all splitting up checks. The restaurant side that we were seated on had a kid's play area, which while I'm sure is awesome for parents, wasn't great for those of us not interested in kids running around and yelling during lunch. Sitting on the bar side would have solved that problem for me though.  

Overall, it was a good stop for a large group. Nothing warranted any significant complaints, but there also wasn't anything that made me want to come back. It is what it is."}
{"text":"Food , service , bartenders and drink .. all 3rd level"}
{"text":"A couple of things I liked right away: Outdoor seating, open-air bar, automobile-related decor, huge TVs with sports, and getting seating as soon as we walked in. Also, as soon as I picked up the menu, I noticed that, in addition to the huge variety of regular diner/pub fare, DWG also has options for kid's, gluten-free, vegan, and vegetarian. Pretty impressive.

I started with an order of the Tijuana Rice Balls (Arborio rice, sun-dried tomatoes, black beans, melted cheddar cheese, chili pepper seasoning; Panko breaded and deep fried; Served with chipotle ranch). Although they were some of my favorite ingredients, they were also fairly bland on the seasoning and a little greasy. The dipping sauce was decent.

For my entree, I had a pulled pork, bacon, black beans, and pineapple salsa wrap. The Carolina vinegar-based BBQ sauce was tangy - and the pork was moist - but, on the whole, I didn't think the burrito was that special.

Unfortunately, our service was really slow (though friendly); and, I thought the bill was a bit much for the quality of food. Also, on a side note, my son's chicken tenders were little more than soggy breading and frozen chicken - and his fruit was old melon and pineapple...not really the kind of fruit most kids enjoy.

Overall, I'd say if you're stuck in the South Side with your kids or a large group, then you might consider the DWG. Otherwise, I don't think it's worth the visit."}
{"text":"The food was delish. Seitan wings are so awesome. So many vegetarian options but also lots for carnivores too. 

I have been organizing a regular monthly event for two years and needed a new location. The Double not only reserved a table for 20+ people but were really flexible when more people than usual showed up. The wait staff was AmAZinG! Seriously. So friendly and attentive and never made us feel like we were a pain. 

Great place, lowkey atmosphere. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Good drink selection with some interesting cocktails and was pretty empty when I was there in the afternoon. I didn't try any food but it looked pretty good."}
{"text":"I can honestly sum up my experience at the Double Wide Grill as \"not impressed\".  I visited the place for a group get together.  Unfortunately, the \"party room\" they have is so small that the 20-30 of us were unable to really mingle much.  The company at my table was great, but other then that, there is nothing about the menu that makes me want to rush back to the Double Wide.

Now the rest of the restaurant with its inside and outside openness I have to admit is pretty cool - as an environment to eat in, sure why not. On the other hand, its not so appealing to me to sit outside on a corner lot directly across from a co-go to consume my food.

Now, I know it is a lot to handle a big group of people. However, I am pretty sure the coordinator of this event called in advance. There was only one waiter serving us - which is not an easy task. On the other hand, I ordered a diet coke at the same time the five people on my table requested refills.  They all got their beers, teas, water, whatever. Me - I had to request diet coke again when she came out to take our orders 15 minutes later. 

Visiting on a Sunday, we had the brunch menu. I was disappointed that there was not as much lunch food offered as there was breakfast. It was one in the afternoon and I was well past wanting to eat french toast or eggs.  They have a small handful of burgers - where the primary variety is choose the meet and then choose the options. OK - fine - if I hadn't had hamburgers that were SO GOOD at my own house.  The only other option other then wings or soup was an avocado club sandwich. So I went with that. It sounds like it has potential in the menu. It was the closest to a turkey club (something I would figure would be standard on a brunch menu) I could get. The waitress came back later and asked me what I wanted as my side, I said fries. I also ordered up a bowl of chili - my favorite food of all time.

The avocado club came out first. Essentially what sounded good in the menu turned out to be two slices of toast with sliced avocado and a sprinkling of jalapenos. There was supposed to be some sort of pesto on this as well, but I sure as heck couldn't taste it or see it. In fact, the overwhelming thought I had was - wow, um, why not just give me a plate of avocado.  Instead of fries, they gave me a side of fruit salad. **Grumble** The fries served with the burgers looked good.

The chili, if you can call it that, came out about five minutes later. It had the consistency of a beef stew, and honestly taste wise was not very far off.  OK, I AM a chili snob, I know - but come on - it's chili. And if you are calling it Jail-house chili, it should have some sort of punch - some spiciness of some sort. But really, had I not \"known\" it was chili, I would have thought they served me stew. The only bonus, they had the right kind of beef in it - you know - stew beef - or chili beef when the seasoning says its chili. :) I had to ask for cheese to put on top, which I got the look of \"huh cheese?\" but got a small little serving of that. It would have been better served with a side of jalapenos and onions to mix in too - so I stole some jalapenos from my sandwich.

Oh, and all this ample blandness cost me $20 (food, beverage and tip).

The company was at least good - and maybe if I do go back with a small group/one other person - or for breakfast or dinner I will be happier - those eating breakfast foods seemed to enjoy it though the Canadian bacon was also canned. 

But as brunch and big groups go, big thumbs down - it will take a lot to convince me that this place is worth more then just a unique environment."}
{"text":"The converted gas station makes for a cool, fun atmosphere and it was nice to have an al fresco brunch on a beautiful day.  But my breakfast burrito was pretty bland and the service was not that attentive."}
{"text":"This place is disappointing. I've heard good things about brunch, but don't come for dinner. I had an appetizer. I sent it back because it was icebox cold, and it came back lukewarm. Definitely detracted from the experience. Beers for $5.75. I'm not coming back here."}
{"text":"Can't speak much to the food, but they pull off the classy hoosier feel pretty well. Drinks did seem a tad expensive for the venue, but the cornhole was a nice touch"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, lots of vegetarian and vegan options! Clean facilities and the dog patio is adorable! The veggyro was delicious and 100% vegan!"}
{"text":"The Double Wide Grill is the place to get decent food and a couple drinks. They have a huge outdoor patio and they even have a part that you can bring your dog. They have tons of drinks available and offer the redneck refrigerator which is a cooler for your table filled with ice cold beer."}
{"text":"Not bad!  Kind of a fun theme, lots of vegetarian options, and a good beer list.  I'm not a vegetarian, but opted for the potato tacos as an interesting choice.  All the fixings of a soft taco, only with mashed potatoes instead of meat.  Very tasty!  Friendly service.  The three stars is because I found it kind of gimmicky (like a Quaker Steak), and that really isn't my favorite atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good food, horrible service. We got there at 5:15 on a Saturday. Our waitress was nice enough, but it took us one hour to get our entrees, which only consisted of a burger and a salad. The place not only about half full. The wings were some of the best I ever had. BBQ sauce was amazing. Sweet potato fries were great and has a tasty, sweet sauce."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE - went in with a group of five. Waitress was very nice took our order. I ordered the Maui Maui with coconut and fries. My sister in law ordered steak. When the meals came out the fries were cold, not warm but cold. My Maui Maui (about 2 oz), was really burnt. The steak was also over cooked. The manager came over and took our plates and said she would be out with replacements. About 10 minutes later the Steak came out and was cooked correctly. The manager said my Maui Maui would be right out. 20 minutes later, everybody was finished eating and No Maui Maui. Being really frustrated I told the waitress to forget it and I no longer wanted the dinner. A few minutes later another waitress brings out the meal. I told her I no longer wanted it. She said I should take it to go because they would only throw it out. She also took the meal off of my bill. I don't know what went on that evening because I never saw the manager again, but I WILL NOT GO BACK THERE. There are too many good restaurants to spend my time and money on crappy food"}
{"text":"Well.....     there was high points and low points.    The meat served here is excellent.    Brisket, chicken, chorizo were all good and the sauces had a good amount of heat.     Fresh salad and food cornbread (which I generally don't like).....   but their sides kind of suck.    I got cheese frits and they didn't salt the grits..... and you just can't fix them after that......   my mashed potatoes were dry and just terrible.......   I didn't even take them home(you get a lot of food... so lunch is covered the next day)......

The service was OK......   the server was attentive but looked me like I was crazy to ask for ranch for my chicken....

The place is decorated pretty neat but is loud and their regulars are kind of obnoxious.....

Overall.....   the meats are great and I suggest people that like BBQ to go......"}
{"text":"The first time I visited double wide, I was very pleased with my experience.  I ordered coconut-flavored tofu and it was delicious! The seitan wings were also very tasty and the service was great, however, the last two times that I have visited it was very disappointing in terms of service.  The service was very slow in seating us (said it would be 20 min for 2 people and it was 45), taking our order, and bringing out our food.  I'm not sure why there would be such a huge difference in service between my experiences, but I can only guess that it was because the second and third times were during the winter when they didn't have additional seating outside? I will probably give it another chance in the summer to redeem itself!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was very Americana, too Americana. Waited 15 minutes before I was even asked for my food. Servers nice, but inattentive. Got the Hawaiian burger, the tiny but of pineapple is supposed to \"make\" the burger. Ribs were excellent. Overall an okay experience probably will come back once in awhile. Not a place to hangout for a drink every weekend."}
{"text":"I love this place! Every time I travel to Irwin I make it a point to stop and eat. The ambience is fun the food is great and the beer is cold!"}
{"text":"Food is flavorless. Unless you love salt. Then it's awesome. Service is slooooow. Food came out lukewarm. Even my 9 year old son thought his cheeseburger and fries were awful."}
{"text":"Great experience , stopped by an old gas station that it's now a  restaurant,  clever idea and the 40 different beers, unfortunately we only tried few of them, definitely we are coming back"}
{"text":"Should be 1.5 stars. Service was very poor. Waitress asked us if we were ready to order, we told her we needed a couple more minutes. She was annoyed and didn't come back for 15 more minutes. Food took forever and we didn't order items that should take long.
Brought the wrong chili for 2 of the people at our table. Replaced it with the right chili, but very cold. Replaced the cold chili with hot chili. Cornbread was awful.  Burger was average. Mashed potatoes were average. Buffalo chicken salad was very stingy. It was basically buffalo chicken and lettuce. Buffalo sauce and chicken were good though.
I am normally not hard to please, but we said we would not go here again."}
{"text":"3 of us ordered BBQ. Ate outside. Good service. Fun atmosphere. Food was solid. Beef brisket was good. Pulled pork too. Cole slaw had highest rating of anything on our plates. Corn bread was too much like coffee cake. Overall true to the genre but nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"Moving from Pittsburgh to Irwin leaves much to be desired for the vegetarian palette. Double Wide offers plenty of menu items for those who don't  want to order the tired grilled cheese and French fries. After a brief overview of the menu, I came to Double Wide for brunch this past weekend with my partner. There were only three other small tables filled when we arrived, so we were sat quickly. I noticed it was a very spacious restaurant with a good size patio and separate bar.

We ordered the fruit plate for 4 to start. It featured cantaloupe, honeydew, pineapple and grapes. We  waited close to 20 minutes for the fruit plate (I assume we were the first table who ordered it for the day and the kitchen started to prep the fruit upon receiving our order). Disappointingly, the cantaloupe was not ripe; it was crunchy and flavorless. Also we expected the fruit to be cut up into pieces, but instead we got three planks of the melon and pineapple, and had to cut what we wanted to eat. 

A few minutes later, our dishes arrived! I was very happy with the Double Wide Benedict. The sweet cornbread and veggie sausage paired perfectly with the savory egg and smoky hollandaise. I wished my egg was runny, it was cooked to about medium instead. My partner enjoyed his veggie burrito and almost (impressively) ate the entire thing. Both meals were accompanied by over-seasoned roasted red skinned potatoes that needed more of a crisp to them. 

The service was great. Our coffee mugs were kept full thanks to the attentive staff. I could, however, hear many of the staff members conversations because the restaurant was so empty, and I am sure they weren't aware that customers heard about their their crazy Saturday night. Overall, we had a great vegetarian meal compared to what is available in the area (pizza, mostly)."}
{"text":"If you're looking for healthy vegan options, stay home like a normal person.  If you want super tasty, dripping in bbq sauce, with several vegan options...run here.  The seitan is some of the best I've had pretty much anywhere, service is always most excellent, and obnoxious vegans such as myself super appreciate the handy little vegan icon next to the plethora of vegan choices.  

The seitan cheesesteak is damn delicious, but it most certainly isn't a Philly cheesesteak.  It's a delightful bbq sandwich, but don't order it if you're looking for a Philly cheesesteak.  


Stupid delicious, most excellent service, and more vegan options than you can shake a stick at.  If shaking a stick at something implied anything...whatever, just eat here."}
{"text":"Food was okay.   The famous ribs were hard and dry.  The corn bread was a small hunk of drywall.

It's sad because I typically go once or twice a month and it has steadily declined.

I can't say we had the worst server ever, but she was pretty close.

If she cared about the customer half as much as she cared about  talking to the other servers ...

She'd be much better off.

Lastly, the $18 - 8oz Sirloin was a half step up from Pondarosa.

Probably won't be back for a while and will probably tell everybody I know."}
{"text":"Let me get the food out of the way, I had the Setan Wings dusted with Cajun seasoning. They were excellent. Had the vegan gyro, also very good. Now this brings us to the attitude of the workers behind the bar....

Sat 10 minutes before even seeing a bartender, no lie, no one was manning the bar area. Finally, someone came and waited on us. I ordered an IPA and half order of the say-tan wings. My friend ordered a beer and neked burger. One bartender seemed agitated with my friend and the way he ordered his hamburger. Dear bartender, if someone wants cheese on their hamburger they would probably order a cheeseburger. 

Totally different feel from the South Side DWG. We were up for the AFC championship game. Nice crown except for one guy who spat profanities every time they showed Mike Tomlin on the screen. After awhile his wife finally paid the bill and got him out of there before he got sucker punched. I was thinking he didn't vote blue. 

Aside from a suburban crowd, slow service, and bartenders with attitude, the North Huntington DWG has great food and good beer selection. One thing they do have is free parking, unlike the South Side DWG. Deducted two stars for the long wait when we sat, and the petty bartender attitude."}
{"text":"Lots of choices on there menu. 
The grilled veggie appetizer is very good. 
Nice place with a different atmosphere than an ordinary restaurant. 
Very friendly staff. 
They also make there own soda  , which is  tasty."}
{"text":"The chicken and pork was really dry, and I was charged full price at 7:02 for a Yeungling (because happy hour was over at 7), when I waited ten minutes for the bartender to show up at the bar."}
{"text":"Wonderful place 
Nice people 
Loved the food 
Very relaxing place to eat for brunch.."}
{"text":"We went to the Double Wide last week and left after being told that our favorite server, Billie, was \"no longer working there.\" We went to the Double Wide Grill every week just to see Billie, and I was so upset to learn that she had been fired that we turned around and left. We won't be back -- Billie was far and away their best server, very warm and personable, always on top of our drink and food orders, and took the time to really get to know us. I genuinely can't imagine what justification they would have to terminate Billie, as she was truly fantastic, and we were just two of many regulars who came there just to see her. 

The food at the Double Wide is just OK. It isn't particularly flavorful or anything that you would make a special trip to eat. Its main claims to fame are (1) having vegetarian and vegan options, (2) having a patio, and (3) having a spot for dogs outside. NOT the food (I don't know anyone who goes there for the food...). My son would get the pizza, and the pepperoni was almost always burnt (how do you screw up a presumably frozen pizza?!?), while my meals usually were under seasoned and dry. For example, the refried beans in the vegetarian tacos seemed like they had been sitting in a pan for hours before being slapped into a taco. Again, we went there because Billie was so friendly and warm, and made the place seem like home. Now we'll find a new spot for our Monday night dinners."}
{"text":"Ugh.  I shouldn't have gone again, but I was was drawn in by the allure of a nice patio.  Never again.

I sat down outside and waited.  Three servers walked in my general vicinity but did not acknowledge my presence, as each likely thought it was the other's table.  I snagged drink menus off another table, then after 10 minutes of nothing my drinking partner went to the bar to order.  It took her almost 10 minutes to order at the bar, as one server was complaining to the bartender about one of her tables, very openly, and the bartender couldn't or wouldn't concentrate.  We finished our drinks at the table, and after 40 minutes, NOT ONE SERVER STOPPED BY TO SEE HOW WE WERE DOING.   It's a shame that they have such a bad staff, and it's not just me...check out other reviews as well as FourSquare Tips...they're just atrocious.   

This place has the most frustrating, worst service in Pittsburgh.  I'm never going back."}
{"text":"Just a shout out to Double Wide for having such a fantastic vegetarian selection.  People, it's a barbecue joint--if they can make a whole page of vegetarian choices, how is it that I go to top-scale restaurants and they only have a token vegetarian risotto (if even that)?  

Food, service, location--all great.  Thank you, Double Wide Grill!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!!  Good service and great breakfast, weekday special only $3.99. Desserts from Signature Desserts, too. Welcome to NHT."}
{"text":"I hate to give bad reviews, this place has gone down hill so far on the food. I've eaten hear a few times and each time has be worse. For my latest adventure here I ordered the cheesy broccoli chicken, grits and corn bread. The chicken came out still raw, the grits were flavorless and the Icing on the cake.......... the corn bread tasted like raw fish it was inedible. The corn bread was always good. The ONLY reason I have this 2 stars were the drinks were good. Pricey but made well and weren't shorted on alcohol."}
{"text":"I never thought I would find much appeal eating in a \"garage\", but Double Wide Grill proved me wrong. This is probably one of the best places for vegetarians because almost every option they have can be turned vegetarian or vegan. I struggle a lot with finding restaurants where I can enjoy a good meal while satisfying my omnivore counterparts, but this place has it all. 

I've been to DWG several times and their seitan dishes never fail. Everything from the pulled seitan sandwich to the wings are amazing! During my last visit, I had BBQ seitan as a protein add-on for my grilled vegetable & brie salad and it was phenomenal. The portions are always generous so you never leave hungry. 

I highly recommend DWG if you're looking for a casual brunch, lunch or dinner in South Side. Service is always fast and friendly while the food is always delicious and filling."}
{"text":"Great food with a lot of vegetarian, vegan  and gluten-free items. BBQ combo platter has fries, garlic pockles, cornbread, sweet potato fries and vinegar based cole slaw. Great tasting Hawaiian burgers.  Tilapia taco or roasted vegetable chili for a lite meal."}
{"text":"Only been here twice so far but love it!   Funky vintage decor and vast vegetarian and vegan menu, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"I don't know why it's taken me years to review this place. Sadly it's one of those places I take for granted and need to stop doing it. I have never had a bad meal or bad service here. The food is pretty spot on. My boyfriend is a Texas native and he will tell you the chili is pretty darn close. Little meatier here but no complaints. His other favorites are the pulled pork sandwich, brisket sandwich and salmon salad. My faves are the nachos, flank steak salad and DW cheeseburger. 
Also I love the outdoor patio seating and decor."}
{"text":"I'm into places with great outdoor seating. I think it's because I like to people watch/spy on people.  It always makes the dining experience more enjoyable!  

It also doesn't hurt that there's a delish brunch offered on Saturdays and Sundays from 10 - 2.  I struggle to find a good Eggs Benedict besides my beloved Perkins Eggs Benny!  They have two versions to choose from, and let me tell you my friend, go with the Double Wide Benedict!  Fried eggs, bacon,  spinach, and CORN BREAD!!   WINNING!  And what makes a brunch even better....a boozy one!  The peach Bellini hit the spot!

What's also great is they have a ton of events like trivia and karaoke nights.  Surprisingly, there are few places in the burgh to get your roake on, so this is a welcome addition!

I'll be back to eat and spy on people this summer!!"}
{"text":"To begin with, the staff was completely disorganized when it came to greeting and seating guests, and the waitress was clueless about the menu.

I asked if I could get the Chantilly Creme and Strawberries on the Challah French Toast (normally that comes on pancakes, which I don't like). After waiting about five minutes for the waitress to check, I was told that I could get that. I was not told that there would be an upcharge for this.

My date ordered the Carnivore's Breakfast with no onions or peppers, and a side order (2) of corn bread since the meal did not come with bread.

When the meals came, mine had the strawberries on the side and no Chantilly Creme at all. Instead they gave me a lump of cream cheese. ?!

My date's meal had onions and peppers and had to be sent back. Also he only got one piece of cornbread, even though there's supposed to be two in an order. When he asked why he only got one, the waitress responded that cornbread didn't come with the meal. He reminded her that he ordered it separately and she agreed, but could not seem to understand what the issue was. He gave up and just asked for another piece.

When the bill came it seemed high ($32 for two breakfasts and two beverages). Looking over the bill, we noticed that we were charged $2.50 for the Strawberries and \"cream\" (cheese). I didn't think to check but I'll bet we were charged for two orders of cornbread as well.

The only positive thing I have to say is that the food was edible, even if only mediocre.

Needless to say, there are a thousand other places we can go for brunch... We will NOT be returning to the Double Wide Grill."}
{"text":"That's it. Done.

I tried it as a meat eater over 7 years ago...FAIL - on all levels. And giving it another go on their vegan menu today. . .FAIL again. This is the type of restaurant that I am referencing when I say that the Top Owners aren't real chefs or foodie people. This is the type of restaurant where a group of savvy real estate people who bought property in busy and upcoming areas, and decorated the insides to pander to certain demographics. 

That being said. The food was awful and they will never get my business again. I literally threw away $30 worth of food tonight. I thought wrong that in looking at their extensive vegan menu, that the kitchen knew what they were doing.

I ordered ToGo thru GrubHub around 3 hours before my estimated pick-up. Thought that makes it easy for everyone. . . It was inedible. We just couldn't eat it. First - everything was cold; but at the same time, there was burnt tofu. So we put the food in the oven to reheat it. That didn't help it at all. The flavors were super vinegary and over salty - I'm not even sure what was trying to be accomplished in either dish. And the vegan veggie of the day were gross packaged vegetables, sautéed in something super salty. My husband and I are both former line cooks for multiple restaurants, and even if we don't particularly like something, we almost NEVER complain, and will finish almost any dish. But we called and complained. It was too much food we were throwing away. :(

I'm mostly mad at myself for giving them another chance. In all of the times I had been there, it was a traditionally bad experience. But no - I had to believe the sheeple and believe that \"their menu really IS good now.\" No. It's not. And it never will be. 

I will end with the ONE plus side - the manager on the phone handled the situation very well with my husband, and took flavor feedback for the kitchen. I don't know what will come of the flavor feedback, but neither will I be willing to find out."}
{"text":"Why don't I come here more often? That is what I am asking myself after coming last night. The food is surprisingly good and there are tons of options ranging from small plates to BBQ to vegetarian. If you happen to follow my reviews, you may have noticed that my theme this week is OUTDOOR SEATING!! (I guess it's that time of year...) With that in mind, Double Wide is one of the best options on the east end of the flats. While they were out of almost everything on tap, our waitress told us upfront and handled it well, apologizing profusely and offering to let us try some new beers. And now for the kicker... they have corn hole on the weekends!"}
{"text":"A very good restaurant with an exceptional sense of humor. There's an inside joke about the redneck owners, but mostly it's about the good food and service. 

I was surprised by the large number of vegetarian options, something unexpected for a BBQ joint. 

The outside seating is wonderful, and it's great to hang out at the picnic tables. 

I've been to brunch here, too, they have a creative brunch menu and it's reasonably priced. Check the website for specials."}
{"text":"Meh.  Cute unpretentious menu and concept.  Friendly staff.  Outdoor seating.  Generous portions.  Excellent beer selection, with everything separated into helpful categories like \"Hoppy Beers\" and \"Stout Beers\".  Their fluffy corn bread side tastes like happiness.

So with so much to recommend it, why only 3 out of 5 stars?  Because this restaurant has everything going for it but the food.  My ribs and pulled pork were dry and tasteless.  The coleslaw, mashed potatoes and fries were bland.  Nothing was terrible, but it tasted like it had been left out under heat lamps in a cafeteria, definitely nothing worth going out of your way for.

That said, if you come here on a sunny day, order some drinks and a side of their corn bread (truly some of the best I've ever had) you will have a great time.  But with better alternatives so nearby, the Double Wide would not be my first choice for a meal.

For a more inspired dining experience, go a few blocks further down the south side and hit Fatheads.  Fatheads also offers a casual style, great beer selection, some outdoor seating and huge indulgent portions but with freshly prepared flavor explosions that will blow your mind!"}
{"text":"Double Wide, you've impressed me. You've been around for years, a South Side staple that appeals to a wide audience, and I always rave about your frozen mojitos. Now, I get to sing your praises for your IMMENSE vegan/vegetarian food offerings.

First of all, the Double Wide has an enormous menu to begin with, and they offer two full pages of veg options. Every item is clearly marked whether it's vegan or vegetarian, and there is just SO MUCH. Most veg-friendly restaurants in the city offer a few options, but it's nothing like what Double Wide has got going on.

Second, the seitan wings. Oh god, yes. THESE are the best wings in the city and as close to the real thing as you can get. What sets their wings apart is the crispiness and the delicious sauces. My only very small complaint is I would love to see a vegan blue cheese or ranch dressing to accompany these delicious bundles. I've also had the seitan gyro twice, and it never disappoints.

Double Wide boasts a huge draft list, offers growlers and pints to go (it's called a meowler, how cute is that?), and still serves the best frozen drink in town. And they have a dog-friendly patio section, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and I had the French toast and sausage. It was soooo good. My friend had the veggie omelet. I will defiantly come back again. Food and service was great. Only thing that was weird was you can drink alcohol (ie: mimosa) until 12noon. I'm from Philadelphia and we don't have that law so I was shocked about that but when it was noon I had the mimosa and Bellini and both were very good."}
{"text":"Recent visit was a big disappointment. Had a burrito and it was beyond weird tasting. Just chicken, beans and rice and it was almost inedible. Pulled pork Sammy was a let down as well as the 15 french fries I was given. Place wasn't busy at all. Beer was solid , same old crowd . Avoid the black bean burger, it looks like it's cut from a square loaf. Tasteless and dry as a bone. I'm one visit away from throwing in the towel with this place."}
{"text":"Music was extremely loud, food was subpar. In a group of 3, only 1 enjoyed their meal and it was a traditional burger. Pulled pork and vegan stroganoff were oddly sweet, like they poured sugar into it. Service was slow, but helpful. I held back giving a 1 star review because they are somewhat new."}
{"text":"I was sold when I saw the Sunday Funday special, breakfast special that is.  A 12 oz. Tecate and a shot of Cuervo (if you're nice, they'll swap it for a Jamison!).  The atmosphere is pretty cool, I dug the authenticity of the garage.  However, I'm slightly confused by the name, sort of makes me think of a trailer, not a garage.  I get it either way, it just seemed odd.  I suggest heading in earlier (before 2 P.M.) on a Sunday for brunch.  It's probably a bit fresher.  I had the Double Wide Benedict.  It's a tasteful deviation of Eggs Benedict using cornbread instead of an English muffin and bacon instead of ham.  They also throw some fresh spinach under the poached eggs.  My whole meal was a little colder than I like, but still enjoyable.  When I go back, I'm definitely going earlier and trying a Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"I get the pineapple chicken wrap with sweet potato fries every time I go here for lunch and they never disappoint. It is a truly unique wrap. I used to not like this place because the food I got was always so-so until I discovered this gem. I get an extra side of the buffalo sauce because it is THAT good and the sweet potato fries come with a cinnamon sugar dipping sauce, which is phenomenal. I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the southside area."}
{"text":"Stopped here while traveling from Chicago to Philadelphia. Saw it from the PA Turnpike and thought the name was interesting enough to try. OH MY GOD this place had quite possibly the best ribs I've ever had. I'm definitely going to come back whenever I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"Double Wide has good beers and food, cool atmosphere, and corn hole outside. What more do you need? 

Double Wide is a pretty cool place to eat and have a drink. It's located in a converted gas station complete with garage doors. The food is pretty good with good burgers and BBQ. 

They even have some pretty awesome vegetarian options that are good by anyone's standards. Their Seitan Wings will make you change the way you think about tofu. 

They have a pretty awesome beer selection and the bar is super cool situated under a lift with an old truck on it. 

This place is great for groups and can handle large and small groups well."}
{"text":"Wow. I wanted to love this place, but I can't even say I liked it. The menu sounded awesome. BBQ for my hubby and some tofu action for me (I'm not a vegetarian; I just happen to like a lot of meatless dishes).  We stopped in for brunch and were disappointed left and right. The coffee was watered down and just not great at all. We ordered a grilled cheese with a side of bacon for our little nephew, and they gave us a grilled cheese with bacon on it AND on the side. Sadly, though, the grilled cheese was probably the best thing we ordered. Our meals were SO not ideal. I got the South of the Border Tofu Scramble Wrap, my husband got the Carnivore's omelet and my sister got the Breakfast Burrito. None of us were impressed. The portions were smaller than expected, the food was dry and lacked flavor, and somehow, our meals were lukewarm at best. I would hope this isn't the case, but it almost seemed like the burrito and wrap were made in advance and refrigerated, then microwaved once we ordered it. If I didn't have a Groupon to use here, I wouldn't be going back."}
{"text":"We lived about three blocks from this adorable spot. I loved walking past an inhaling the rich BBQ smoke every time. And while the decor was funky, fun and the ideal patio drinking location, I had to give it -2 stars for the consistently inconsistent food from the kitchen.

Don't get me wrong, the food was fun and appealed to all palates and dietary needs. My boyfriend and I could tear up some serious Junk Yard Nachos and my gaw, their Chicken Bonanza should be illegal for how tasty it is. 

I just hope they've changed the recipe for their turkey burger. I am extremely sensitive to the food service industry. I worked my way through high school and college in almost all job descriptions at restaurants. I've never sent food back. Ever. But the turkey patty was not the ground turkey style you'd typically expect. It was cold, minced turkey mush and it looked like it wasn't cooked through. If it were beef, I probably would have been fine, but because turkey can cause more foodborne illnesses, I got nervous. The server was apologetic, but explained that their patties are different. I wish the menu indicated that.

We never made it for brunch, but I have no doubt its awesome. This is a fabulous spot in the spring to sit outside or inside for Karaoke in the fall. Solid spot. If you're on East Carson Street, give it a go."}
{"text":"We eat here everytime we are visiting our daughter.  The breakfast are great.  Think traditional with a twist.  I enjoy their eggs benefits but today I am getting their truckers breakfast.  It a great place with great ambiance.  When you are in the south side you got to try this place."}
{"text":"We just had a drink there...a lucky soda, the local coke made with cane sugar, giving a unique flavor to our drink. We enjoyed it in their patio facing a beautiful mural. Our server was really nice. The overall experience was enjoyable"}
{"text":"I lovvve Double Wide but I just ordered seitan wings through post mates and in the order I politely asked for a side of ranch with the wings. Which it always comes with either ranch or blue cheese and celery/carrot slices. This is what I received. Two pieces of celery and no ranch. Not only are they supposed to come with the order, I specified which sauce I'd like. I know they saw the note because the order called for 1/2 and 1/2 --- something totally normal when you order in person. I know it's just ranch and vegetables but it completes the appetizer :("}
{"text":"Cool! Been there for dinner and breakfast. Outstanding food, hugely varied menu and super efficient yet extremely friendly serving staff. Wait often looks long but you are always seated much faster than quoted by staff. Vegan and gluten free available. Kitschy, fun decor a la \"trailer\" name (tarps on pipe drapes, hubcap lighting etc) Never disappointed here. Whole family, picky eaters included, loves it!!!"}
{"text":"What a place. It's definitely...double wide? Very large interior AND exterior, which feels almost impersonal, even though they tried to fill up the space with gas cans, tires, and other garage-y paraphernalia. Still feels like waiting in a plane hangar for fuel!  Now, I can't speak for the virtues of anything meaty here, since although I definitely had three different meals....they were all vegan! Seitan wings, coconut rum tofu, and garlic tofu. The seitan wings were pretty darling, definitely a great alternative. The garlic tofu was GARLICY, woo...but not much else! The coconut rum sauce was pretty brilliant....however, the amount ladled over the tofu was not enough to flavour it impressively. The caramelized onion cilantro rice was actually the highlight of the coconut rum platter, which included bland vegetables of the day and the aforementioned rice. Not sure if the prices matched the flavour, but the portions were pretty much perfect. I want to like this place, fo' realz; the menu in theory is wonderful...maybe next time it'll hit me right!"}
