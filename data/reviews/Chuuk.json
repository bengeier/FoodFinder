{"text":"This is the type of restaurants that should be at the waterfront.  It's a shame as it should be located where the Waterfront Restaurant is.  Fresh food and amazing cocktails.  The owners know what they are doing.  Had the guacamole and it was better than what I had in mexico a month ago.  The dishes are appropriately sized so you are satisfied and have energy to go enjoy the waterfront.  I had the braised beef and humuous taco's.  The beef was tender and tomatillo was tasty.  The humous taco was good but I had to add some of the tomatillo to it for some zip.  Best thing overall was they had Bellwoods line of beers.  Had the wizard wolf and it complemented the food!!  Take the trip up the strip for a great dining experience as the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Gorgeous atmosphere in this newly renovated restaurant. Staff was friendly and helpful with the menu. My husband and I love family style meals where you get to nibble and taste a little of everything ordered to the table. This place was good for that.  Guacamole was full of flavour and the chips came out hot and fresh.  Empanada had such a nice crisp pastry with a good heat in the sauce and the sweet taste of Gouda in the middle. It was a little small considering it's not loaded with filling, perhaps they should offer two empanadas for the cost, however we did enjoy it.  We then had the Cochinita pibil tacos. The flavour was perfect, the taco shell really held up to the amount of meat, didn't break or go soggy. My only complaint was that it was a little greasy/fatty. It was far from dry as I had read in other reviews, and there was a generous amount of meat in it, maybe just cut out some of the fat when serving?!? We then shared the braised beef. Very tender and a good size portion. The sauce was a little flat, mainly tasted like tomato sauce and we expected a little more flavour given the cultural influences. We also felt like it could have been served with a side of some sort to help absorb the sauce. It was still enjoyable and we ate every bite, it was just a bit of a let down given it cost $26. Probably won't order that dish again unless it's improved in some way.  We skipped on dessert as they only offered a cupcake which they were out of and one other dish that sounded too sweet. Would like to see some sort of take on a churro as a dessert option, they always go well with Mexican type cuisine.  All in all we did enjoy our dining experience, it's nice to have some new flavours in Pickering as we have grown tired of all the pubs, chains and burger joints we seem to keep getting. We often have to travel downtown Toronto to get anything close to this flavour palette. We will be back for sure, may try some of the other taco options next time and skip the expensive meat dishes.  Pickering really needs more restaurants like this. We've been to bar taco in the USA and it was amazing, so is La Carnita in Toronto and our recent new fav, Antojo in Halifax. These trendy taco street food restaurants would do so well in Pickering. Come on restaurant entrepreneurs, open one already!"}
{"text":"Opening night! Impromptu visit to check out the new place. Although the total construction isn't done yet, the main dining area and bar are complete. An expanded dining area and patio are to come.  I learned, while I was there, Chuuk is owned by the same family that owned Massey's in the same space for decades. The next generation has taken over and rebranded the business. I wish them continued success for a long time to come!  Since this wasn't a planned visit, I thought I would just have a cocktail and an appetizer. The guacamole looks good. Uh oh, sold out. My very friendly and helpful server, Stephanie, recommended a few options but I chose the Empanada.  The bar menu was a few pages long but I ordered an Old Fashioned (Cuban rum, piloncillo, aromatic & seville orange bitters). They do have some interesting cocktails on the menu, along with some Tequila, Mezcal, Rum, Beer, and Wine.  The cocktail was very refreshing as I waited for the empanada. It was taking a while but Stephanie surprised me with a complimentary Cochinita Pibil Taco ((Stonecroft farms, ON) Berkshire pork shoulder, achiote, pickled red onion) to tide me over while waiting. The flavours blended well together and it tasted pretty good.  The empanada ((Mountainoak Cheese, ON) gouda, tomatillo habanero salsa) arrived as I was about to tackle the taco. The habanero had a nice flavour and just a little bit of heat. It was really good!  Although this was a very small sampling (since I was solo), I enjoyed everything that I tried and the service was very good. I'll definitely come back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Gorgeous. Beautiful bar, patio, table seating, and bathrooms with plenty of parking. Well-branded and visually stunning.   Food: Overcooked, little depth of flavour (which is a sin for Mexican), incredibly overpriced.   Empanada: The salsa and shell tease you with bold flavours until you discover there's little-to-no filling and you're eating what tastes like a pastry shell.   Clementine Xec: Essentially $9+ tax & tip for a cut up jackfruit with intense citrus flavour. Gets tired fast.   Cochinita Pibil Tacos: Pork shoulder's pretty hard to mess up; it's forgiving and a great cut to easily get tender. This was very dry, and the taco had a singular flavour of a mild tomato sauce. As with the tacos that followed, the tortillas were too thick, resulting in a chalky texture that muted the filling's flavour. A mark of a good Mexican restaurant is the tortilla, and these were a misfire.   Tsi'ik Tacos: Completely overwhelmed by the flavour of lime, obliterating all other flavours, including the beef.  Achiote Rice: Mushy, overcooked.   Braised Beef Shoulder: Finally meat that wasn't dry. The waitress recommend we order the rice with this, as the dish lacks any starchy side (it's a chop of chuck with a generous portion of sauce.) The greens on top made the dish difficult to eat, as they would fall into the sauce and as you ate, it would splash against your face. I'm okay with messy dishes, but this was a design flaw.   Overall, the restaurant is beautiful and while the food photographs nicely, it's simply not conceived or executed well, and the prices are not reflective of the quality. I can see the desire to pop in for their craft beer selection, beautiful patio and atmosphere, but this is not a dining spot we will return to. We hope it improves and wish the owners all the best."}
