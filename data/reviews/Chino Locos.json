{"text":"I guess I'm not excited about this place because for me, it not only has limited options, it doesn't actually have a good option. The \"Juicy Vegan\" is one of the most expensive items on their menu, and when I ordered it, the woman at the counter asked me if I want sour cream or cheese. And I ask... well is it vegan sour cream or cheese? to which she replies \"no it's not included\" (???)   Dear restaurants, if you have something labelled \"vegan\" on the menu, could you let your staff know what \"vegan\" actually means? Thank you.  We waited about 20 minutes to get our orders. After I picked out the big tasteless spears of tofu out of my not so juicy  \"Juicy Vegan\" it wasn't so bad. I liked the diversity of vegetables, it was an ok size, but I'd probably opt for Big Fat Burrito or Burrito Boyz instead of going to this place again.  My friend ordered the special of the day which was a Korean BBQ burrito and his reaction was equally meh.   I wanted to like them, because I love burritos and I'm nearly always in the village, but it just didn't happen."}
{"text":"So bland, I thought I bit into my finger. Talk about underwhelming flavours. I'm not sure if they just forgot to season every element of the burrito, or if they felt cardboard inspired burritos were going to be a big hit. Save your money and go elsewhere, and if I haven't convinced you and you still want to try it...walk on over to your bookshelf, grab yourself an old book and take a nice bite out of any side. You'll get the same great taste and experience without the disappointment that comes with terrible food you were excited to try moments ago. Not to mention the money and time saved."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for burritos. They are not the traditional type but very tasty. The place is never busy when I go in. Staff is nice and friendly. The burrito is pretty large therefor very very filling. If you don't feel like having as much, although not sure if it's a permanent item, their \"Tacos, Tacos, Tacos\" Are very good. It's a bit lighter and fresher."}
{"text":"Horrible. I ordered the steak burrito and there was hardly any meat, the burrito was dry as it lacked sauce, was basically flavorless and the noodles tasted overly processed. Their other location at Queen and Greenwood is better but they lack consistency. Will not go back. Bland, bland, bland.."}
{"text":"Excellent, consistently made, and innovative burritos.  My only complaint is internal temp of burrito is never quite hot enough - i have to go home and microwave before i eat it"}
{"text":"Tasty burritos, loving the fish or steak options. Very friendly service, make sure to try it out!"}
{"text":"Its a nice place to be go to. Takes a little longer to get your food from other places I have been to, yet, it has a fresh taste, yet some ingredients over power one another instead of having a balance flavor or even having the spice kick things up a notch. I love Mexican food, and have had it in Mexico, So Cal, and now here in Toronto. Have to give it 3 out of 5 for being OK but not the best.   Cost is fair, staff is ok... Would I go back again ? If I was seriously hungry when I go near the place maybe, if not, I would skip it and go someplace else"}
{"text":"When you have a burrito place whose name literally translates to \"crazy Chinese\", you have to go inside and see what it's all about. With two locations in Toronto, Chino Locos serves up some unique (and large) burritos that have Asian influences to the filling. One of their most popular uses of Asian ingredients would be using chow mein to stuff the burrito instead of the standard rice. They also have asian themed proteins along with the classic Mexican ones to put in your burrito such as Korean beef or General Tao chicken.  I tried their fish burrito with chow mein and it was interesting to say the least. I like how Chino Locos does not fry their white basa fish, instead they sauté it keeping it tender and flavourful.  To continue reading my blog and to check out the photos, click here http://bit.ly/1kFooju  Happy Dining!"}
{"text":"Went after was recommended to go by a friend.  Portions were pretty big but found the actual burrito to be nothing special.  Got one fish and one pulled pork.  Most of the filling was the chow mein and found that pretty bland.  The fish was good but not too much was found in the actual burrito.  Also felt like the black beans weren't cooked thoroughly.... Maybe it's just a personal preference."}
{"text":"Had the Korean beef with chow mein for lunch.  It mixes well with the traditional burrito toppings in wonderful but not weird way.  The hot sauce is actually very hot, so careful with that!  The selection of Mexican soda is nice too, the mango went very well."}
{"text":"I'm a bit disappointed  I checked this place after some of the great reviews online. I think they are a bit off, unfortunately.  The ingredients are fresh and their proteins are good. The noodles and some of the other unusual ingredients are a nice touch, too.  Service is friendly.  However, it comes down tot he fact that the burritos don't really stand out and they are forgettable."}
{"text":"I went to San Francisco earlier this summer as a non-burrito fan, and was completely converted after eating burritos on Mission street.  Now that I'm back in Toronto, burritos have generally been disappointing so I was skeptical about Chino Locos, especially after some of the reviews I've read.    WOW.  I was wrong.  I had the pollo loco and my boyfriend had the steak, both with rice, to go, on white tortillas.  These burritos were glorious.  Nice and toasted, full of good stuff (black beans, not refried!  lots of guacamole, moist and flavourful meat).  Medium spiciness was the perfect amount of heat.  So glad my boyfriend convinced me to go.  The prices were also what I think a burrito should cost.  Will definitely be back.  Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Favourite Toronto burrito. And the staff are so nice! Noodles in a burrito, no need to further explain."}
{"text":"Well, I spoke too soon. The new Chino Locos is nowhere near as good as the original.  I've been to both this location and the Greenwood one many times since writing my last review as I live pretty much in between both. Most of the time recently, I've been finishing up my Gerrard/Broadview burrito and feeling slightly disappointed. Then, I try the Greenwood location again and am reminded of why that branch is consistently rated higher.  Everything just seems to be of a higher standard at Greenwood - the pork is juicier, the veggies seem fresher and the burritos are toasted for longer.   The service is also way better at the other branch. This wouldn't usually be an issue for me when it comes to quick takeout places, but twice the poor service at Gerrard/Broadview has directly impacted the taste of my food! Last time I visited, a man in front of me in the line was waiting for his burrito to be toasted. I'd say he was waiting about 60 seconds or so. I placed my order and the staff member made my burrito and put it under the toaster alongside this other gentleman's burrito. About twenty seconds later, both burritos came out at the same time, mine disgustingly underdone, the other customers' probably charred and sickly burnt. Bleh. That's just laziness from the staff. No excuse.   I'd encourage everyone to go to Greenwood instead. THAT location really is worth the hype."}
{"text":"Solid place for burritos. Great tasting food but...I would use this as a takeout place. Not really much room to sit and eat."}
{"text":"If you have read my reviews you know how much i *usually* hate anything fusion. I still do. But for some bizarre reason, mixing two cuisines that sound impossible has actually worked in this case, and well. I certainly see why you could think they were loco.  This is Chino Loco's second restaurant, the first being the hugely popular Leslieville location.  This location is much larger, and it is lacking a little bit of the cozy charm that Greenwood has, but there is plenty of room to sit down and eat your lunch.   My choice is the Da Finest, the white fish burrito, with rice instead of noodle and made spicy. It is HUMONGOUS and good value for $7 or so. Bonus points for edamame beans. Really nice guys, really helpful, enjoy the customer service. This is definitely the kind of pace that you can tell that these guys are really passionate about their business, their customers and their food.   If they made the hot sauce spicier, I would give them 5 stars.  **UPDATE! After writing this review I inevitably wanted a burrito. Literally thought about this for 3 minutes staring at the screen and then ran. Spicy was much spicier! Coworker that I bribed to come there with me and I split two. One Black bean with Rice (good!) One White Fish with Chow Mein (EPIC!) Since this took place within an hour of first writing, I thought it was ok to just update this post. Chow Mein & Fish burrito pushes this to 4.5. Jones Soda is a disappointing $3.50 before tax, which is my new \"not quite a five\" prohibiter.   4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Now, while the UYE certainly earned at least 4 stars, this little burrito joint on Church Street still has a waaaays to go before living up to the raving reviews of it's predecessor at Greenwood. The owners have done well in filling a burrito void in the Village and despite it's downsides, will likely succeed in giving folks their burrito fix.  As before, let me say that I'm guilty of reviewing the establishment as a whole, which in turns affects my enjoyment of the food. As well, also note that the place still had a couple of days before it's grand reveal, so maybe (just maybe) there was some magic to be worked over the weekend. Though, I doubt it.  The fact that the entire place seemed a little blahze when it came to running with their \"Crazy Asian\" theme rubbed me the wrong way. It's a great theme, but the posters seemed a bit too small, the props a tad too sparse, and the bearer of the Mexican wrestling mask entirely too uncomfortable. All the fluorescent lighting did was further convince me that this place had the same vibe as a defunct Johnny Rockets.  The burritos, on the other hand, did help improve the situation. Chow-mein in a burrito? Bizarre and boggling, but somehow, it works. Main attractions such as beef, pork and chicken are typical and the veggie option is decked out with thin slices of tofu and edamame. Yet despite the fusion of two typically flavour-heavy cultures, the burritos did seem to be lacking the kind of kick one might hope for. Perhaps that's what the addition of their incredibly spicy Green Sauce (as I have since dubbed it) is for. Or maybe just more spices and sauces would have helped, too.  If you find yourself in the area and are curious for something undoubtedly unique, sure, it's worth trying. But when everything about the restaurant's concept screams \"Crazy! Exciting! Nutso!\" and just ends up as \"Okay. Mmm... pretty decent. Interesting.\", the letdown is such that it won't have me returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Disappointed:   Looking forward to the burritos that had received such positive reviews on yelp and other sites, my brother and I went for dinner at Chino Locos the week of March 25 2012.   We were pretty disappointed. I had the Juicy Vegan burrito & he had the Rib-eye. We both found the meals to be bland. I'd even ordered mine as \"hot.\" It was a 1/5 level of spiciness. I usually enjoy a 3 or 4 out of 5 level of spiciness. His Rib-eye had about 8-9 small half-bite-size pieces of meat and mine, which I'd ordered for the aubergine, had about 5 small, miss it if you blink slivers.   We did both like the noodles instead of rice option, but the burritos themselves were bland. And, frankly, cold in the middle. Sorry Chinos. You have great, friendly staff, but your cook was either off his game or you need to get back whoever it was that made everyone else's meal so good.   HOWEVER if you like soft drinks, WOW. So far I've returned to the place twice just to get some more of that amazing Mexican pop \"Jarritos.\" So good.. pretty sure I can get it at the Mex i Can grocers on Carleton though so I probably won't return to Chino Locos of my own accord again."}
{"text":"cheap eats, but smaller than average size burrito. interesting fusion concept, but could be done better.  also somewhat dark atmosphere"}
{"text":"The burritos here were worth the walk. I loved them. The only comment about this location is the stairs to get in. It would be hard for anyone unable to climb lots of stairs to enter the place."}
{"text":"I ordered food to go over the phone and was told it would be ready in twenty minutes. After showing up a generous twenty five minutes later, the guy working said he hadn't even started making it yet. Not cool, I was in a hurry and on my way to work. I waited for him to make my burrito (fish with beans, rice, cheese, salsa, guac, the works) and when I got into work and took a bite, I realized the only thing in the burrito was beans and rice. Literally the whole entire thing was just full of black beans. No sauces, no guac and certainly no fish. Just so. many. beans. It was the driest most tasteless lump I've ever eaten in my life. Infuriating since I'd waited extra time and was nearly late for work because of it."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with some foodie friends and left pretty disappointed, though I'm still glad we checked it out. I mean, how else will you find out, right?   Place was quite spacious and clean. Staff were also very friendly. So that alone I'd give 5/5 stars.   My friend and I shared Da Finest which is their basa fish burrito and also an Off Da Hook which is their rib-eye burrito. Because they said that their medium hot sauce is super spicy, we opted for their mild sauce. We got all fixings in both burritos so the portions were actually very good. You can definitely fill up with just one burrito.   With Da Finest, we opted for rice. Fish was nicely fried with a nice batter and a generous amount of rice, beans and guacamole. The mild sauce was so mild that you could barely taste anything. Thankfully I have a Sriracha-to-go so I was able to add some flavor to it. I wish I had my Cholula hot sauce instead though which is the best hot sauce out there for Mexican food and even Italian. Gonna give this one 3/5.  Then there's the Off Da Hook burrito. We opted for the noodles instead of rice this time. Interested, sure but still lacked flavor. Admittedly I picked out the little cilantro from both but because there was very little in the first place, it wouldn't have done much with respect to flavouring. The beef, however, was very tender. Sometimes beef is tough but this was perfection. As much as I appreciated the tenderness of the beef as well as the quantity, it still lacked flavor. Gonna have to give this one also a 3/5.  Nacho and cheese was a huge disappointment. The ones you get from the theatre are much better in my opinion. For its portion size and overall taste, it's definitely not worth $4.99. 2/5.  They had one with pulled pork and another one that's a special jerk chicken that I'd like to try. Don't think I'll go back anytime soon, though."}
{"text":"I ate my burrito in fifteen minutes. Not because I was rushed. Not because I had nothing better to do. I simply could not slow down. It was that good.   If you know my full name, you know I had to order the Da Finest, a sautéed white fish burrito with all the fresh fixings. I chose rice, but I'll def be back for the chow mein noodles with another burrito another time.   \"How spicy do you want that, Danielle?\" I wondered why the burrito barista asked my name but enjoyed that he used it frequently. Pretty fast service too. The medium was a perfect heat for me, not wimpy but not making me gag and beg for water. Come to think of it, I didn't drink anything with my burrito. I guess that's my bad for not asking. Anyways, it would have interrupted my eating process. Da Finest was juicy, crunchy and full of punchy flavours. Maybe I'll be a champ and get it spicy next time.   Not the best décor I've ever seen and the place was empty when I came in but all and all, for those prices, a cute and bright place. Watch the step while going to sit at the window. I tripped on the way there AND back. But if you want something you can savour, or in my case devour, hit this place up!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite neighborhood spots, I get take out here once a week!  There are several reasons why I keep going back.  1) BURRITO AWESOMENESS Delicious whole wheat burritos stuffed with chow mein, edamame beans, guacamole...  My two favorite fillings are the slow roast pork and the basa fish (both $6.99).  The Korean beef is tasty too, but not quite as tender as the pork and a bit fattier.  The sweet and sour rib special was super tasty, but I've only had it at their other location by Greenwood.    2) GREAT SERVICE Min is awesome! He makes my burrito perfect every time!   And they've hosted a Yelp event here before...   Woo hoo Yelp supporters!  3) MEXICAN WRESTLER MASKS are awesome.  This place has been a bit quiet the past few times I've been here. It could be the cold weather...it could be the location. It's located upstairs, so it can be hard to miss.  I want this place to be around forever, everyone should eat here! Because I don't know what I would do without my burrito fix!"}
{"text":"The whole Chinese food in a burrito thing is really weird but like many have already stated it works. Aorta far ive only done the rice but sounds like I need to try the noodles. So far I've had the cicken and the pork both of which have been pretty tastey with a nice bit of spice. Really the best thing it has going for is that there aren't really any other burrito joints around here. Its not bad but I wouldent mind a real burrito."}
{"text":"Chino Locos provides an interesting take on the burrito!   Pork, chicken, beef and vegi burritos with the option for rice or chow-mein noodles plus the typical burrito toppings. The scallion addition ads for great flavor and the verde hot sauce is HOT!   My favorite was the chicken with chow-mein followed by the pork carne with rice.   Overall a wonderful addition to the Church & Wellesley strip. I will definitely go back whenever I am in the area.   Huge burritos = very filling.  YUM!!!"}
{"text":"The burritos have a reasonable amount of kick to them, but I found it a bit dry. I went with spicy with extra-hot sauce on the side. Spicier than Big Fat, but I don't think it warranted the 'warning' the server tried to give me. Can't speak on the chow mein noodles because I haven't tried those yet. One of the better burrito places in the area, so I'll probably be back, but it hasn't unseated Bandidos as my favourite."}
{"text":"I am of the opinion that word fusion is used too often when describing restaurants around the city. While I remain skeptical of titles such as Indian-Mediterranean kebabs or French-Texan grill, I must admit that the idea of a Mexican-Asian burrito tickled my curiosity just the right way. Although it is licensed to serve liquor (bottled beers), and the dining area gathers plenty of light and a great view, this place cannot shake the feeling of a fast food restaurant. I tried the steak burrito and my ladyfriend ordered the pull pork variety. The portion is quite large and could be better suited for lunch rather than the late dinner that we had. The burrito is quite delicious and topped to the neck with different ingredients. However I found that there was a noticeable lack of steak meat throughout certain parts of my burrito. She did not have this issue. Mainly because there was no steak in her sandwich to begin with. Although there is a sign warning you, you have to keep in mind that MEDIUM IS SPICY! Overall this was a pleasant experience and I will most likely be returning to try a second item on the menu. However I would not treat this joint as anything more than a quick, cheap bite if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Mmmm burritos! This is a decent place to grab some yummy burritos if you are looking for some and are in the area :)  This place doesn't have a ton of seating area but if they were to try and squeeze in a few more tables, getting around would probably prove to be a hassle...otherwise everything else seems all right. Clean and...small restaurant? Mind you, their preparation area/drinks area/cashier area takes a good one-third of the restaurant.  I came at a non-busy time so I was able to order right away after looking at their menu for a few minutes. I got the rib-eye steak burrito and had everything in it with mild spicy. It was delish! Packed with a ton of everything you find in a burrito!  Overall, not a bad place to stop at if you are hungry, in the area and wanting some burritos :) nothing majorly special but nothing majorly bad either! Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"I came here twice. One with my family and one time to take away my order. I like their focus! They are a Burritos restaurante above all. I tried their Nachos for starters and it also went really well in my palate.  The good experiences I had in here:  - the pork burrito really taste Chinese and Mexican! - I loved their mexican soft drinks. Mango is my favorite right now. - I liked their soundtrack!  I suggest you to come here. It is a different experience. And it's cheap!"}
{"text":"I affirmed my resolve to make the trek here when I saw this place on \"You Gotta Eat Here.\" My thought process was \"OMG I BOOKMARKED THAT!\" and \"IT'S ON TV NOW! NOW I HAVE TO GOOO!\"  So when I did finally make it here, I got the steak burrito with chow mein and loved every bite of it! The steak to my surprise, was not overcooked, excellent quality beef, and there was a generous amount of it! The burrito in its entirety is also pretty hefty, so will definitely fill you up for lunch. Something else that I liked about it was that it didn't get all soggy at the bottom and fall apart, which unfortunately does happen at many other burrito places. However despite this long list of positives, I was slightly unhappy about the chow mein. I didn't think it added anything to the burrito (for some reason I expected it to be crisp to add texture, but it wasn't) but it was just soggy and flavourless. Will return to try it with rice so I can actually say which is the better choice!Maybe I'll readjust to 5 stars after the rice experience =)"}
{"text":"I've tried this new location and I have to say I am not impressed, a lot of beans for sure and very little steak. While the server was pleasant it wasn't as welcoming of some other burrito joints I have visited.  I like to be able to stand and watch what is going on while my burrito is being made, to me this is part of the experience. This place doesn't lend itself well to that at all.  The decor looks very make shift. I don't think they followed any theme or design. The preparation area doesn't flow well either.  I am on pursuit of the best burrito in Toronto and I have to say, this isn't it.  For taste I would have to say it is Burrito Boyz in Little Italy takes the prize. Any suggestions please let me know."}
{"text":"I ordered a big bean burrito and it was very bland. The noodles are a nice change but it didn't have much flavour. Needed more sauce or seasoning."}
{"text":"So this is a burrito place paying homage to being in Chinatown East. I got the Bento box which is a burrito without the wrap. I asked what meat is their popular seller and he said the chicken and pulled pork.   I opted for the chicken. I got home 10 mins later thinking the cheese would have been melted; hot food + cheese = melted cheese. Nope. And the chicken was really dry.   I can't see them staying open for too long serving food like that."}
{"text":"Interesting concept but the room is stale and the lights much too flourescent to have ANY type of good ambience. The burritos are LARGE but it is mostly filler- with LOADS of rice or noodles. I have to say that the rice is fairly bland, but the noodles are quity tasty. All meat options taste pretty much the same- but the FISH is pretty darn good. I say two stars just cuz.. I really have experienced a better burrito."}
{"text":"Last week I met up with a highschool friend for the first time after highschool graduation for burritos at Chino Locos: Dos Locos, the Church street venue. I'd never been to this Mexican fast food joint before, but I heard great things about their burritos, which is the only thing they make and serve. I was glad to find a spotless and nicely lit dining area and knowledgeable and friendly burrito cooks/ cashiers (they're the same person).  Their menu is rather limited, but that's not necessarily a bad thing because what they offer is actually quite good and there's something for everyone, particularly for me, the vegan: they have 1 vegetarian burrito with cheese and sour cream, but they also have 1 vegan burrito that is sans dairy and meat - \"the juicy vegan.\" The vegan burrito was so good... priced at $7.99 before taxes, it's actually the most expensive burrito on their menu!!!  The burrito consists of pressed tofu, eggplant, shitake mushrooms, glass noodles, guacamole, tomatoes, edamame beans, red onions, black beans, green peppers, cilantro, chipotle sauce, rustic rice... all wrapped in a whole wheat wrap. (You have the option between white and whole wheat). The cooks told me that they made their own guacamole at the restaurant, and to me, anything made from scratch is a big bonus! One set back to my burrito experience was the hot sauce... it wasn't hot enough, even though I'd asked for extra hot -I LOVE spicy food.   You should check this place out if you like Asian food and Mexican food... the Asian-Mexican influence on my burrito made it a crazy dining experience for my taste buds... those Chino Locos fo'sho! (Translation, Chino Locos = \"crazy Asians\" in Spanish)."}
{"text":"Wow. It's hard to believe this place has been open since November and I didn't know about it until now.  I like it enough to go back when I need a quick food fix. All the prices are $7 and the menu is simple - makes it easy to order.  The \"spicy\" option could be a little spicier -I'll ask for that next time and see how it goes. All in all the burritos are great quality and tasty, for being \"fast food\". The chicken is my favourite so far with the pork being a close second.  -1 boo-urns to the decor. It's so, so vacuously bland. And far too big of a space for what it needs to be. I'd rather see a small ground-level, or even sub-level space with stools at the window to eat, than the second-floor emptiness as it stands now. I have never eaten-in here - mostly because I'm always on the go - but the inside just isn't welcoming and cozy enough for the personal touch that the workers bring to it.  +1 to the worker I spoke to for being a \"reasonable\" and sensible Leafs fan :)"}
{"text":"Amazing burritos at an affordable price.  Owned and operated by Asian-Canadians, they produce the best burritos in all of Toronto.  The best thing is that they can substitute the rice in the burritos with noodles, which is unique as I have not experienced anything like this before. With a range of different fillings and flavors, the portions and taste are worth the price.  Only negative point is that they don't deliver. Otherwise, please skip Taco Bell and come here instead. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awful. Soggy tortilla filled with just rice, some beans, and a bit of tomatoes. No fresh vegetables, no guac, no cheese, no flavour."}
{"text":"I didn't really enjoy my bean and cheese (sans cheese). Was a dry and rice was hard. Portions large and service was friendly, good and quick"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan, however I do like to eat meat free on a regular basis. I opted for the vegan burrito which was pretty much all noddles, a few pieces of tofu and a few beans. What a total let down!! And to top it all off, the vegan burrito is more expensive than the steak burrito?!?!   Fat Bastard Burrito is far far better and the vegan veggie options are actually pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Had the \"Da Finest\" fish burrito and the \"sweeeet\" pork bento box. Our reaction was that the flavour was underwhelming.  The meat tasted like it had no seasoning and it would have been nice if the noodles were at least a bit crispy.  I also expected the food to have a bit more asian flair.  Overall the location is spacious and we got our food quickly, although it wasn't very busy because it was a Sunday night.    Probably won't be coming back here. For an imaginative concept the food could have been more flavourful and inventive."}
{"text":"Guess who has opened up a new location? Chino Locos baby!  While driving down Broadview one night I noticed a familiar sign to my right, it said \"CHINO LOCOS\".  I have been to the OG location numerous times standing in a small compact area with limited seating.  You could practically turn around and touch all 4 walls but  I always find myself coming back because they make one of the more unique and tasty burritos in the city.  They have created a fusion burrito using Asian and Mexican flavours by adding ingredients such as edamame, chow mein or using proteins such as basa fish and adobo chicken (special).   As soon as I found out they were opening on April 29th I immediately contacted a friend to go visit the joint and wish them best of luck.  Positioned on the corner of Gerrard/Broadview next to old Chinatown seems like a weird place to set up shop but I think it is brilliant.   The area is slowly being populated with young small families who frequent many restaurants along Gerrard like the numerous pho places, dim sum spots or Rose Cafe (my fave).  Now you have this cool, hip burrito shop which still encompasses the Asian culture but adds what Emeril would say \"BAM\", some spice.   Once you walk in you will notice this store is about 5 times bigger than the OG lol you can actually sit at a table and eat your burrito which is nice to have.  The space seems a bit bigger than what they need but I am sure they will figure it out soon and fill it up with more tables or pinball machines.  We both ordered the Basa fish burrito, which is my favourite, with half chow mein/rice and fully loaded but medium spice...be careful because their hot sauce is homemade and packs a heavy punch.  One thing I did notice is that they have the same old school Coke fridge like the OG location.     I will have to apologize because I was so hungry I totally went out of character and forgot to take a picture of my food LOL however I have some pics of the store which I will upload shortly.  If you have never tried Chino Locos you better get on it quickly.  Once I declare a place is \"my fave\" in the city it usually is with other patrons too.  Try it out and let me know if I am wrong :)"}
{"text":"A unique place in east china town for a fusion of mexican burritos and chinese food. You have your choice of it being stuffed with rice or chow mein. The food here was good and is priced reasonably well. For those who like heat, go  for the hot. I like hot sauce but settled for the medium and was left unsatisfied. Don't like the staff talk you out of it like they did to   me :(."}
{"text":"With too many taco and burrito places popping up lately, Toronto is awashed in an overplayed Mexican food fad at the moment. Burritos however doesn't excite me much. Burrito Boyz, et al... meh!  Chino Locos however, is different. Whether it is the east end roots, the fact it is operated by an Asian guy, or its simple menu that lets them focus on one thing only, Chino Locos offers a burrito experience that stands out without much needed hype or in-your-face-hipness, even though all they do is combine Mexican and Chinese tastes in a fusion bundle that actually turns out to be \"tasty good burritos.\"  Of the few times I stopped by so far, I haven't been disappointed. From the menu choices, you have a choice of getting your burrito packed with fried rice (which isn't that special), or chow mein (now we're talking--it really makes for a life-changing Chino Locos kind of burrito). It's funny to see them note that \"medium\" spiciness is actually \"HOT,\" and when you decide you want your grub \"spicy\" spicy, they warn you that it is actually \"HOT HOT HOT.\" Which doesn't bother me as a chilihead with desensitized taste, that the highest setting amounts to a bit of a tingling. Maybe I ought to ask for extra-spicy-to-death, but if you are weak on the chili, get it in mild and see how that goes.  Unlike their original Greenwood Ave shack, this location has some seating. At the southwest corner of Broadview and Gerrard, fronting East Chinatown, Chino Locos seems like out of place at first glance, but seems fitting in representing what the area is now and what it might eventually end up becoming in the near future. Its location is conveniently situated to capture the attention of hungry commuters on three streetcar lines."}
{"text":"Ok so i have been dying to try this restaurant for the longest time since having tried Burrito Boyz and Fat Bastards colleague of mine that lived downtown told me about it and mentioned if i was downtown worth checking it out.  So weekday dinner time hungry and in the mood for Burritos told the wife about it and she was excited to try it as well.   Set off down Church street looking for Chinos Locos ended walking from Bloor all the way down to College could not find the place. Decided to call the restaurant told we are at Church/Maitland by the way staff were very rude and unhelpful with directions.    Proceeded again to walk up and down searching for this place used both sides of the streets could not find it hmmpf!!! I thought i was going insane turned on the GPS on the cell literally went around in another circle until I saw the SIGN!!! BEWARE the restaurant is ontop of a pub and you have to look for a sign that has a white background with faintly colored yellow and orange writing on it!!!   So we go up the stairs to the restaurant and were informed that they were closing in 10 mins and it was take out only. Explained that i was the person that called and if they had told me the restaurant is ontop of a pub and given me the name of the place i would have been there half an hour earlier. Still the staff person was not interested insisted take out only. Thought about it but seeing the price of the burritos is already not cheap getting in home and eating a soggy tortilla did not seem appetizing.  ADVICE - Treat your potential customers better exceptions could have been made i did not plan on spending all night eating my wrap also when giving directions be clear as possible after all you do want customers to find your restaurant.  The restaurant itself did not look appealing inside and honestly i do not want to go back although i heard good things. Will continue getting my Burrito fix elsewhere."}
{"text":"I just finished downing a fantastic Pollo Loco burrito with chow mein and (of course) no cilantro.  YUM!  This is my first trip back since the Elite event.  They've turned off the eye searing fluorescents and added a rope light to the miscellaneous step near the front of the restaurant.  The burrito was great as always and Chino's continues to be easy on the wallet, and now easy on the eyes."}
{"text":"Aside from not being open late-night, I've now found my go-to food joint in the village.    The burritos are killer and the staff are great.  Anyone who's complaining about the ambiance resembling a Subway franchise needs to remember: you're in a burrito joint.   I haven't tried the fish, but luckily my girlfriend has the appetite of one, so I got to try the pulled pork burrito, as well as the korean beef.  The pulled pork was alright, I've had better pulled pork a ton of times; but it definitely got a huuuuge helping hand with the green onion and ginger relish.  The korean beef didn't really taste like any korean beef I've had before, but more importantly, it still was super tasty and spicy.    So aside from not really being authentic (what do you expect from a Chinese Burrito place offering Korean beef?) it's definitely a whole lot of awesome."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and pretty much every experience was gross.  The latest time I went in, the girl at the cashier took my order as if it was the first time she'd ever taken anyone's order, and asked me to repeat what I said 3 times before she understood. They didn't even end up making it right.  I also fully watched another guy cash someone out and handle money then try to come over and wrap my burrito WITH NO GLOVES while touching it!! Actually disgusting and violating health codes. You guys should be wearing gloves at all times.  The worst part is that when I got home there was a hair in my burrito. Couldn't believe it.  The food itself is not consistent at all, first time was good but the last few times it was just plain dry and flavourless as the sauce was not well distributed. Probably never coming here again unless they train their staff properly. Yuck"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Chino Locos as I'd heard great things. I just had to try the basa fish burrito with the noodles in it. I asked for hot. I was not pleasantly surprised. This burrito was so bland! Almost the entire thing was noodles, with some fish and black beans and a couple random pieces of tomato thrown in there. I couldn't detect any bit of spice in there so I had to go home and dump a bunch of hot sauce on it but I was still wanting some spice. I really didn't get the whole noodle thing either, they were just mushy and weird.   Burrito Boyz still has the best burritos in town!"}
{"text":"It's just ok, but I thought it would be more flavourful.  I found it bland, but still made with a lot of attention.  Another thing: their business hours say they open at 11:00 am but more than once I've arrived and waited 20 minutes to no avail, I eventually left before they opened.  If you have trouble opening at 11:00, then change your hours to 11:30 or noon.  Really poor form to open more than 20 minutes after your stated start time."}
{"text":"Awful service and inconsistent quality of food. I usually order the chicken burrito with rice, sometimes it'll be okay but then sometimes it's really bland. I've seen employees not follow basic sanitary rules here. Save your money and time, go to burrito boys instead"}
{"text":"Big disappointment after reading so many good reviews.  Food was bland, rice was dry. Outside of having the choice of chow mein noodles in your burrito instead of rice, there is nothing noteworthy about the food.  Also, although the seating is sparse, there was a ton of clutter in the back."}
{"text":"Excellent always.  Best burritos east of Yonge. Portions are huge,  prices are fair, spicy is spicy.  Always have the rice myself.  I like them so much I might just see if they're open right now..."}
{"text":"Great Burritos! My go to spot for lunch. Steak Burrito with everything in it. Make sure you get noodles and rice."}
{"text":"I keep trying and they keep getting better.....from now on I will only get my burritos with the chow mein.....there is just something about it.  They are getting busier, but they need to get the word out on Church Street More....they are in a hard location - drunken ppl can't get up the stairs.....  Bonus on the interact and CC machine now....a must in that area.  I hope it gets better in the summer for them....they need to add more sour cream and guach to their items thought - it's a little lacking."}
{"text":"Even for someone like me who loves California burritos (french fries inside), ordering the pork with chow mein was an adventure. I'm happy to say that it was surprisingly good and interesting, a nice blend of favors that you wouldn't expect.  The size was normal, nothing out of this world, and filling enough for a meal. The choice of Jarritos and real spicy chipotle sauce were great for the food. The only thing was that the price, considering that you're mixing two of the cheapest cuisines around, seemed a little high. Take off a buck o two, or offer combos so I don't end up paying $12 for a burrito and drink, and I'll become a regular."}
{"text":"This is quite silly of me, but I have to be honest with you. While my favourite burrito on the list is the Juicy Vegan (Hell-o pressed tofu, eggplant, shitake mushrooms, glass noodles, guacamole, tomatoes, edamame beans, red onions, black beans, green peppers, cilantro and all that other good stuff that goes into the other ones too!), I'm often dissuaded to get it because it's a dollar more expensive than all the rest of them ($7.99 v.s. $6.99). I know it's just a buck, but that's a lot when you're nickel and dining. Besides, why should I pay more for about the same amount (which I'm unlikely to actually be able to finish anyway)? If the ingredients are more expensive, they should really just put less in and charge the same price.   In any case, I'm usually happy enough to save a dollar to go towards a tasty Jarrito (\"natural\" Mexican pop in tasty fruit flavours like mandarin and mango) and go for the fish burrito or the always tempting (because it's fleeting and zany) weekly special. On my latest visit, it was sweet Korean style beef. While the signage touts that the slow roasted pork is the best, I'm not entirely sold. It can at times be a bit dry for my liking.   The toujours friendly staff at Chino Locos sometimes makes me wonder whether there's something in the burritos. It's too dark up there and business seems to be a lot slower in the winter (maybe everyone is just taking them home), but they're always extremely nice and chatty.   The sparse decor and dim lighting admittedly leave quite a bit to be desired if you're going to eat in this easily missed second floor location of Chino Locos. However, if you're lucky enough to grab the table by the window, the prime overhead Church Street people watching (a.k.a. voyeuring) viewpoint will most definitely change all that. I actually really like the vintage prints of painted movie posters that are hanging on the walls. They have just been hung in rather strange spots. Perhaps it would help if there were more of them.  I can hardly wait until the weather gets warmer and we can take these tasty bundles al fresco again!"}
{"text":"Definitely a better than average burrito place. Walked in around 7pm on a Friday night and we're the only one there. We had a pork and a fish burrito.   First they serve some taco chips, which was pre-made ones and the salsa sauce that comes with the taco just got out of frig. -1  When the burrito arrive, which didn't take that long. First thing we notice is the size of the burrito. The pork burrito comes with rice, which is i would say very traditional and average one. The rice could be more favourable. But like I said, a traditional one.  The fish burrito is definitely the better of the two, with the chow mein, which add a nice texture and favour to the taste. My girlfriend can only finish 1/2 of the burrito, and I get full by finishing one. So if you want a good cheap eat, this is the place.  Surely I would want to go to the original one to see if it's done differently."}
{"text":"Very good burritos.  A complex mix of flavors and if you ask for spicy it's actually pretty spicy.  I've only tried \"Da Finest' which is fish and the daily limited special which was Korean Beef.  I wish I'd been in the neighborhood longer to try more."}
{"text":"The plus...this location is way more spacious.  The downside...it's been a while since I've had a burrito from these guys and I gotta say I was underwhelmed. I got the pollo locos and thought the flavour was monochromatic to say the least. Although I saw them putting lime on it, it wasn't enough to brighten it. The one edamame bean I found in it wasn't up for the challenge and the cilantro listed on the menu was nonexistent."}
{"text":"My fish burrito with rice was the blandest I've ever had. Sure, the medium is hot, but the mild is boring as sin. Lighting is strange and atmosphere sad. Looked better from the outside."}
{"text":"I don't know what these people are talking about.  These burritos are the best period.  Everything is fresh and made to order. This place has mad flavor.  Just a fyi if you like yours really spicy just ask.  Tell the guy to throw some heat on it."}
{"text":"I came here alone on an impromptu trip after investigating the burrito scene in Toronto, reading others' Yelp reviews and deciding that a burrito filled with noodles instead of rice was a MUST-TRY. I can't remember exactly what time I went (it was on a Sunday), but the place was empty save for the employees. I awkwardly ordered the \"Biggie Bean\" (probably making some lame gangster gesture while doing so) and opted for medium spice, as I was still recovering from an incident at Burrito Boyz where I foolishly told my burrito barista to make my burrito as spicy as possible and consequently lay on my bed writhing in gastrointestinal agony for hours.   I sat down at a window table and peered down onto the street as I eagerly awaited the arrival of my beloved burrito. Service was prompt and friendly - as I would have hoped, for I was the only customer - and my burrito was delicious, although for some reason I expected the use of noodles in lieu of rice to have a more profound effect than I ultimately realized. A surly-looking Mexican man brought me some water in a foam cup halfway throughout my annihilation of my burrito, which I thought was nice.  Overall, a nice change of pace and a good place to take (and impress) a burrito connoisseur!"}
{"text":"I don't know what everyone is complaining about, I LOVE THESE!!! My kids love them! It's super filling and healthy, and when I get my kids them I am happy and they eat every last bit, which for my kids is saying something as they usually eat like birds. Maybe people are expecting something else? A Chino Locos Burritos is it's own thing, and it's absolutely delicious, AND a complete value for the money."}
{"text":"The Chino Locos at this location does lacks the charm compare to the Greenwood location but I can tell you that their Fish Burrito with Chow Mein is equally awesome!!  The fish was pan fried when I placed the order and the burrito was stuffed with tomato, beans, chow mein and of course spicy spicy sauce...  Tons of seatings, great for eating in... especially during the cold winter season.  BTW, the spicy sauce bought tears to my friend's eyes..."}
{"text":"I love me a burrito. When I saw a chow mein burrito, and all the mixed reviews associated, I knew that eventually the day would come where I would try this creation. Spoiler alert: They are serving one heck of a bland, mediocre burrito here at chino locos.   We had the pulled pork with 'medium' hot sauce, despite knowing from reviews that it may be bland. At the cash there was a sign saying, \"medium is HOT\" (yeah, in caplocks and everything!) So we went safe, just in case. The pork was dry, the sauce non-existent, the noodles mushy, and I can't even tell you what else was in this since there was just no flavour. However I can tell you it ended in a soggy mess - that's where all the pork juices went!   We ordered the hot sauce on the side - it is very hot, made with serranos (I think?! much hotter than jalapenos.) So order it if you want some heat. Real heat. \"I love hot food and this is spicy\", kind of heat.   I bring nothing new to the reviews - I can only prompt you to listen to the bad ones and avoid disappointment. All those leaving 5 star reviews have clearly never had a good burrito before and I feel really bad for them, even chains are producing something better, or equal.   The benefits of here... it's cheap! We went in hungry and came out satisfied after sharing a Jarrito and a burrito for ~$10. They had some good tunes playing, the staff was nice, but you won't ever catch me here again."}
{"text":"OK, so the concept of this place had me really excited for a while - it's like Mexican/Asian fusion where they stuff chow mein into burritos, so I was like \"DAYUMMM, that's genius!!!\" Maybe I had set my expectations too high then, because while the concept is cool, I thought the execution just wasn't quite up to par. I mean, the burrito wasn't bad, but the chow mein didn't really add any extra value or oomph to the burrito compared to any other regular burrito. I also found the whole thing overall to just be too bland, which really surprised me because I was expecting a heavy burst of Asian... or Mexican... or any kind of flavour. I believe I got the slow roasted pork burrito which was supposed to have scallion-ginger relish in it - again, sounds like it could be amazing in theory, but didn't deliver. I think mostly my disappointment stems from the fact that I see so much potential for this place to be better - I mean, the burritos are huge and cheap, like less than $7 before tax, but I just can't deal with the lack of flavour. I've heard that the other location (the original one, at Greenwood) is a lot better, but unless I coincidentally find myself in that area I don't really see a reason for me to try this place again."}
{"text":"The best burrito place!!! Drove from yonge and finch just to have their slow roast pork burrito!! Must try!! The owners are super friendly and enthusiastic!! Great place:)"}
{"text":"After walking by a hundred times, I finally stopped in for a quick bite to eat.  I should know by now that Mexican food in Toronto is going to be bad 19 out of 20 times. This was not a lucky exception.  I got a veggie burrito. I was pleased that it included actual veggies and was wrapped properly so it didn't fall apart immediately. Unfortunately, it didn't actually taste good. The beans were oddly raw, which is something I'd never experienced with burritos before. I got it \"spicy\", which just meant they tossed some jalapeños in there, so there was some spice but it was still weirdly bland.  Overall, not the worst Mexican food I've had, but I wouldn't do it again. There are better (non-burrito) options in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"did not blow me away at all... it was very meh... the fusion thing is a little weird for me.    chow mein in a burrito was weird, especially when the chow mein wasn't even good on its own.  in my opinion it did not add any value to the burrito.  Rice is definitely the better option.  The quac is definitely missing the lime factor.. there is no kick in any of the food.  I would have preferred more lime.  I dont know how long this place will last, especially since this location seems cursed.. whatever opens in this location usually closes down.  although it does seem to be the perfect location in the middle of a intersection with 4 TTC transfer stops..   The front staff also said \"feel free to tip us.\" while handing back my change..   TIP: thats not cool.. that kind of pressure makes me have a bad feeling about this place."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night and the place was empty. Not a good first impression because I thought they served great burritos. Anyway, the customer service was great. The guy who took our order was very friendly and accommodating to my \"special\" preferences.  The price wasn't so bad either because the burrito was HUGE (bigger than Burrito Boys/Bandidos). But it's just too big for me. I stopped enjoying my dinner half-way through the burrito. I got the pulled pork and it was OK. I like the pulled pork from Burrito Boys better. My boyfriend got the fish. He couldn't finish it either.   Overall, good experience but I wouldn't go back. Worth a try, though! :)"}
