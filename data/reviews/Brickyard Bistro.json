{"text":"Simply fantastic! Had the lamb shank special! Recommended by our server David Just delicious.  Met a friend for dinner and have to say I will definitely be back.  Great service. This place is a must try"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Friendly attentive service, quality food, reasonable prices.  We shared the ratatouille as an appetizer and had the fish of the day which was Basa as a main. It was truly lovely...light, perfectly cooked with potatoes and asparagus.  Generous portion.  No room for dessert.  Effort like this needs to be rewarded. A great night out in the neighbhourhood!"}
{"text":"Really great gem!  Took the fam and we murdered the dishes.  Really enjoy the duck and sweetbread!  Added a few wine flights and the food just really enhanced the experience.  Weds night they have a 1/2 off bottles."}
{"text":"Bad Service, Anti-Family

This is the third time been there for the good food. However, the service is really bad today. The Asian staff is very friendly, but the bold hair short guy(with the creepy tattoo) was rude and not willing to serve.

There're only few customers on Saturday afternoon, but don't know why the short guy arranged our table to the back end near the smoky open kitchen and told us they don't have any chair for the baby(He seem don't welcome family with the baby to this restaurant). 

Therefore, I asked if we can move to the front of the restaurant because the table near the open kitchen is too smoky, then he said it's smoky everywhere in the restaurant and not willing to let us move. Also, as he said there're no chair for the baby but we found a highchair near the cashier. 

This bold hair short guy keep talking with friend outside the restaurant and making this restaurant unprofessional."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant! Love the ambiance and the food is so tasty! Perfect portion sizes. They have great special options. Duck confit is my favourite dish there. The staff are great too! David our waiter was so friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back again and again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went during the weeknight with the family for dinner. Service was excellent and the staff were all very friendly.  I think we were lucky to get a table - I'd recommend making reservations.

We had the bread board to start, and it came with some excellent dips.  We also had the escargot, mostly to freak my daughter out, and they were delicious, served with wonderful pastry. Even my son liked them.

I had the duck confit, and it was divine, with wonderful, crispy skin. My son ordered the pork cassoulet with red cabbage, which I think was the best dish out of any at the table. My husband had the steak frites, which he thought were great. 

While it isn't a specifically child-friendly restaurant, the staff did go above and beyond to accommodate my very picky and particular daughter who exists on carbs.  They prepared a skillet of roasted potatoes and cheese for her, which she loved.

The desserts were all amazing. I tried every one, and the peanut butter creme brulee was the best of the bunch.  

Highly recommended. It is lovely to have such an excellent French restaurant in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We came, ate and had a great time at this place. The service was friendly and the menu didn't disappoint. Unfortunately they were out of the pork cassoulet as the last one had been ordered when we arrived for our 8 pm reservation, but we would definitely come back to try it. For a Saturday night most of the tables were taken but didn't feel crowded. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner there last night ......the place is small, so a reservation is well-advised. Service friendly and efficient. Food tasty and well-presented, though my Pork Belly Casoulet could have had more pork and less belly, if you get my meaning .....On Wednesdays they offer 1/2 price wines from there well-chosen list of mostly Ontario wines .......well worth a meal  ....."}
{"text":"Cozy place . Friendly owner who seems passionate about the food , beer , wine and coffee ."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon because the wait at Maha's up the street was ridiculous. 

I had the espresso beef hash, although the name sounded more appetizing than it was. Disappointingly there wasn't any espresso taste in the hash and the portion wasn't the largest. 

My friend had the croque Monsieur with an egg and that looked pretty good. 

Service was good, but the ventilation wasn't the greatest and you will leave the place smelling like grease smoke."}
{"text":"This place does not only have promotional half priced wines on Wednesday, it is also striving to be unique and very farm to table.  All the wines are sourced in Ontario.  Who know I would enjoy a Pinot Noir from Beamsville.  But I do and I have.  The service is great and they are the only restaurant that give you your bill in books.  Seriously. Now the fries are to die for. So deliciously salty and starchy to pair perfectly with any wine.  The pork belly with beans was so meaty and generous with the flavours and sides.  My friend's had the steak frites which were smothered in blue cheese deliciousness.  The interior is so light filled and pretty.  I will come here again to read a book and enjoy a quiet glass of wine.  Why not?  Even when it is not a Wednesday, I will come here .  This place is a gem and they represent Ontario very well in wines and food."}
{"text":"This is such a fun place to eat and hangout. I've been here a couple of times for dinner, was lucky enough to grab a seat at one of their wine soirées, and was there today for brunch! 

I usually go for the specials, which are always delicious, but will say that the steak frites and duck are a fav! This is also the first place where I had escargot and it is now my favourite appetizer. 

They have a really great wine list and do flights, and Jesse (one of the owners) will always enthusiastically suggests wines that fit perfectly with your meals. 

Now dessert, and I can't stress this enough, TRY THE PEANUT BUTTER CREME BRÛLÉE."}
{"text":"The brickyard bistro is a café and a restaurant. We went there for lunch and ordered the duck confit hash and the salmon crepe, with a soy late. The food was good and the latte excellent.

The restaurant was nicely decorated, with fresh flowers on the table. 

The receipt was brought in a book, which was really cute. Service was great and the wait staff was very passionate about the menu. 

Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for quiet drinks and snacks on a weeknight.  I love the decor.  It's super cute with festive lights and winter themed decorations on the tables.  The place was relatively busy for a Wednesday night but the server was attentive and amusing.

We ordered beer and a few snacks to share.  The beignets were just the right amount of sweetness and came with chocolate and caramel dipping sauces.  I would definitely order this again!

I have to say we were both disappointed with the cheese plate.  There were only two tiny pieces of cheese which isn't very much given the price.  The board also came with grainy mustard, fig spread, crackers, and fruit but the serving size was just too small.  

They have a good variety of wines and beers.  Overall, we enjoyed ourselves and will visit again when we are in the area."}
{"text":"What a lovely new place in the East end of Toronto.  The vibe is relaxed and the service was exceptionally friendly.  My group of 5 girls enjoyed the escargots, duck confit, and fish specials.  We're a diverse group so having us all agree on the great service and food is truly rare.  I finished off with a latte and the rest said they enjoyed their desserts of cheesecake and creme brulee.  We're def going back when they start serving brunch as well."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to eat here for a while since it is nearby us in Leslieville. I kept checking out their menu as I went by on my daily dog walk and thought the menu sounded varied and delicious. Today on the way home from a post operation checkup (all is well) we said \"Let's do it\". Well - so glad we did. The friendly staff, the willingness to do a substitution- Hash Browns in place of Frites - with my Chicken Salad on a Croissant topped with Apple and Watercress was really good. The Hash Browns were not greasy and were delicious, as was the sandwich. My wife had Pulled Duck Hash Confit with Mushroom, Arugula and Two Poached Eggs. Says it was great. The coffee was fresh and flavourful. We really enjoyed this lunch and will go back for dinner very soon. Our waiter Phil was efficient and friendly. One thing I really liked was that the music was not so loud that conversation was out of the question. Recent visits to The Maple Leaf Tavern and The Keg both were way too loud and spoiled our experience at both places completely. Why restaurants think that super loud music is needed is beyond me. One thing that I really liked was just because I'd never seen this before - instead of a plastic folder enclosing the Bill at the end of the lunch - it was presented inside the pages of a book - a copy of The Waldorf Astoria Barbook. I thought this was way cool because I'd never seen that way of presenting the bill before."}
{"text":"we came for brunch on sunday, we wait for the food at least after the server took the order, we didn't get the food yet, so we ask the server how long we have to wait, the open kitchen is so small, and lots of orders came in at the same time, so we have to wait at least 45 mins. i have to cancel the food order cuz i was running late for another date. the service is good, but the food waiting time was disappointed."}
{"text":"What a neighbour jem! We tried it because of all the positive reviews and it lived up to the expectation. We had the duck confit, steak frites, pork belly, escargot and daily fish special. They were all great!!! My favourite was the duck confit, the sauce was decadent. Dave our Server was beyond friendly and accommodating. Chef Jason is a one man show and catered to the full restaurant. Did I mention half price wine Wednesdays??? Selfish part of me don't want it to blow up so we can always go there but I want to make sure they get the 5 star rating they deserve will definitely return. Welcome to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Ya, I get it....anonymous reviewer, must be a friend of the resto.
Nope! Just was recommended by a friend, of a friend.

Now, with THAT out of the way......this place is lovely. Yes, lovely!
Started my adventure with the best darn beet salad I've ever tasted. Fresh and delicious!
Next, I thought I'd be adventurous, and was recommended the seared tilapia. Excellent recommendation, and certainly wasn't disappointed. Wow. Tasty, fresh and the presentation was superb. Good choice, Mr. Waiter! 
Ended with a lovely Americano, and a great little chat from some of the staff....and, think my overcast Thursday night was complete.

I will definitely be back, with friends in tow!"}
{"text":"great food, great people, lovely space, great wine.  brunch has gotten really really good with the new menu, they take coffee, wine, & food v seriously. the type of place you can eat multiple times a week or go for a special occasion. difficult balance to strike very well struck by brickyard bistro"}
{"text":"Love this place so much! 

Went for a weekday brunch with a friend and our two babies (they have high chairs!) and had a lovely meal - we both had the seafood crepe with salad .. and finished with a homemade pop tart which was amazing. Their wine list is outstanding - lots of great local selections (Ontario makes some incredible wines!). 

Went again recently with my husband for a Friday night dinner and we had an excellent experience, too. I started off with the most incredible 'tartine aux champignons' which was to-die-for, paired with the Greenlane Chard. I had the lamb special which was also so lovely - cooked to perfection - paired with the Cornerstone Syrah. My husband had the beef marrow to start, which was very good, and the duck confit which was also very good. All the ingredients are clearly very fresh and of the highest quality. I so appreciated the lovely plating, too. It felt like a fancy night out but without any prentension.  

Our server David was the absolute loveliest and even brought us some beignets on the house (he must have known we're tired parents who never get out for fun!). We even got to chat with the owner, Eiko, for a little while which was so nice. Great to hear the story of the restaurant and chat about how awesome the East end is. This truly is such a lovely neighbourhood gem. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First time and we were so pleased with the service, the food, the decor and the atmosphere! Gave it a 5 star because it has nailed the French bistro perfectly...neighbourhood vibe, pride of ownership, charming decor and absolutely delicious food at a very fair price! Great surprise to find that they offer their wines at half price on  Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!  Stopped in here on a whim for breakfast a couple months ago (don't remember what I ordered) and really enjoyed it. The decor was bright, fresh, clean, and the tables had tiny vases of fresh flowers. Given that it was winter, a heavy curtain draped the entrance to block drafts of cold air, which is always appreciated. Though they were short staffed that morning, the staff that was working was on the ball and very friendly. My Americano was good and I do recall that my main was also very good. I loved that milk, cream, sugar, jam, etc, was served in the cutest little bowls and jugs. I'd definitely return here."}
{"text":"Great ambience, fancy French food at decent prices, attentive and friendly staff, extensive Ontario wine list.

Jad the lamb with couscous and fried eggplant and it was spectacular!"}
{"text":"The Brickyard Bistro is an everything cafe which everyone wish they have one of those in the neighbourhood.

7:30 am - Get your caffeine fix and maybe a pastry to start your day
10:00 am - 3 pm Breakfast/Lunch/Brunch whatever you like to call it alone or with your friends
3 pm - Time for a coffee or tea break! or maybe a beer or 2 from local craft breweries
5 pm on - Early dinner or a pre dinner cocktails?! I heard Farm to Table: fresh ingredients and VQA wines to pair

All I have to say their brunch/lunch menu is interesting. We loved the dish we ordered. Unpretentious, excellent plating and just tasty.

PULLED DUCK HASH ($14)
Pulled duck confit with mushroom, arugula and two poached eggs
-Amazing potatoes! Eggs perfectly poached. 

LONDON FOG FRENCH TOAST ($11)
Croissant based Bread Pudding in the style of French Toast with Whiskey Creme Anglaise, Blueberry sauce and fruit
- I was sold on that croissant based bread pudding! And the sauce was so smooth and rich without too sugary!

They also collaborates with different wineries offerings pairings on a monthly bases. And don't forget to check out their specials offers during the week!"}
{"text":"I hate to write a critical review because we need a good spot in the hood and this is hopefully more of a nudge for the staff.  This is a bright and airy spot (we went for brunch), with good music and a nice relaxed vibe.  The challenge was really with the service more than the food.  Missed my coffee order, forgot to bring us menus, didn't write our order down so had to come back and ask again, got the order wrong (brown not white toast, soggy bacon not crispy and clearly chopped up a fried egg and tried to convince us it was scrambled).  Still ironing out the kinks I suppose.  We'll go back for sure as local business need support, and I suggest you go too as it was likely just and off day."}
{"text":"Never been for brunch but the steak frites are amazing. I want to swim in a pool of the blue cheese sauce they make. Good drink specials too."}
