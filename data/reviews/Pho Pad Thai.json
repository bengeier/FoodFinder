{"text":"I love this place! Close to home, close to work, Friendly and very prompt service and good food! :)"}
{"text":"First time here to try out their pho. They were very accommodating as I did not want msg in my soup and they made a new broth msg free! 
My husband said the pho was delicious and the beef very tender. Also their spring rolls are good too. 
Ask for Ken Ho or Lisa. Very helpful and lovely smiles. 
Excellent! Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Ok menu and food, decent quality, good enough to be a regular restaurant. The service was friendly, and managed to recognize us our second time there."}
{"text":"For my visit, we order Laksa seafood noodle soup $7.99 and Egg shredded pork skin rice pork chop $7.99. The soup is great and rich, pork chop is tasted juicy and not overly salty. Overall the food here is great, the service is excellent.  I think this is probably my favourite pho place in Markham!!"}
{"text":"We did not order the usual dishes here, instead we brought a number of fishes over for them to cook.

The Vietnamese Sour Tamarind Soup (Canh Chua) with fresh fish - amazingly the PH is just right.  It is not sour and does not take over the taste of the fish.  They are well blended together and enticed the freshness of the fish.  Everyone enjoys this soup.
Stir Fried fish with celery and beans - The fish is fried to leave the meat tender and juicy, yet it is not oily when it is in your mouth.
Grilled fish - one small mouth and one big mouth - both are very tasty and fresh.  I noticed that when the bodies are sliced slightly open on both sides of the lateral line.  The big mouth tastes better
Rack of lamb - I don't know what herbs are used to marinate but it is medium rare and cooked really well
Fried vegetables - normal dishes

As its name is Pho, I haven't get a chance to try its Pho.  Probably will come back again."}
{"text":"Food not bad but service is horrible. I wanted to use credit card to pay for the bill. At the first place, the waitress seems like doesn't want me to use credit card. Second, the card machine doesn't work, tried couple times and it shows connection error on the machine. But the waitress's attitude really rude. She said something seems like I don't have any limit in my card to pay for only $26. She not even asked me to try another card, just asked me to pay by cash. I definitely will not go back anymore!! 

PS:  I can use my credit card without any problem in Walmart right after!!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great little gem. The food is fresh and the service is fast. We had Pad Thai and a curry dish and spring rolls to start. The portion sizes are generous and the flavours are great. It's a bit westernized, so no mystery meat  

I have only been here for lunch but plan on going back for dinner."}
{"text":"The pho was pretty awful, wouldn't recommend it. Asked for thin noodle but they gave us thick, service was good. Maybe will give it another chance."}
{"text":"* Pho is very satisfying
* Place looks clean
* Average priced
* Decent service and can get busy at times"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a quick weekday lunch. The staff are friendly, the tea is delicious and hot, and the prices are right! The pho is very good, and I also like the curry (the roti is amazing!). There's not much of a wait, though I'm a 1 pm lunch kind of person :) Usually, I get two dishes with my Mom and we share - they'll give you an extra bowl to share the pho, which is easier than I thought it'd be :) Mango salad is another favourite, and the pad thai is tasty (with different noodles to choose from). One of my favourites, I've been more times than I can count!"}
{"text":"A great place for pho in Markham. We arrived on a Sunday night at 8:30PM. Place was pretty empty, maybe because of bad weather and it being late. Don't expect amazing service. The food did come fast though. 

We ordered two things, house special pho $7.50 and a thin vermicelli combo $13 (Spring Roll, Minced Shrimp on Sugar Cane & (Chicken/Pork or Beef) /w Vermicelli). The pho was good, not amazing but good. Can not compare to some of the places in scarborough though! It was more on the pricey side so if I had a choice I wouldn't come here for pho. The vermicelli combo I would come back for! It came with a stack of rice paper and hot water so you could make your own rolls. Kind of like a DIY meal. The plate was really big, I wouldn't be able to finish it myself. There were a ton of toppings. It felt pretty worth it for the amount of toppings and variety it came with. You could probably make almost 10 rolls with the amount of food that was on that plate.

I wouldn't come here specifically, only if im in the area and im really craving pho or want their combo!"}
{"text":"Spacious Vietnamese/Thai restaurant with a solid menu of food and drinks to choose from! Every time I come here I order the laksa noodles with seafood - it's amazing and contains mussels, shrimp, fish balls, fried tofu, and an egg. So delicious, I'm craving it just thinking about it! The pho is great as well and is made with a flavourful broth. They definitely don't skimp out on ingredients here. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I think of the pho places I've tried this is actually my preferred soup base. On an objective level they may not be the best soup base, but subjectively I find the flavours here to match my taste the best. Dinner specials are also fantastic! The boyfriend and I got the special with chicken pad thai, beef flank pho, shrimp spring rolls and 2 red bean ice drinks all for well under $25 if I recall correctly. Food quality was consistently good among all the dishes, even though I personally didn't like the shrimp spring roll because I didn't like the herb in it but the bf thought it was good. Keep in mind that dinner specials (and presumably lunch specials as well) are cash only! The waitress was nice enough to let me use debit instead though.

We also came back for a pho craving and I ordered and finished a large beef flank pho. They were not at all stingy with the flank! Extremely generous portions of nice fatty flank came with my pho and I loved every bit of it. Also having tried both the thick and thin noodles, I personally think that the thick ones are better!  Also servers here are fairly good at English which also put me at ease since my chinese is fairly \"meh\".

All in all, this will probably be my go to pho place for any cravings in the future. OH and also they're pad thai. That was really good too. I guess Pho Pad Thai is a very appropriate name for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Met up with my girlfriend for some birthday pho. The place was not too busy but not empty either. They promptly sat us down with some tea. The waitress knew my girlfriend so well and what she was going to order. We both got the 202 but with thin noodles and the beef cooked well done. It was so delicious! Not a crazy burst of flavor but with the hot sauce it gave it a nice kick. The beef was cooked perfectly with no raw pieces. i never usually finish my pho but this one i did. The noodles weren't too heavy either. i would definitely come back and try the other options. Not pricy at all either. Definitely a good place for the winter months"}
{"text":"My friend really likes this place, and goes here quite often. Met up for dinner with her and she picked. Im not usually a fan of Thai food, but I gotta say I was quite impressed. 

The space is quite large, and there is definitely lots of seating. Does seem to be a bit cramped though, especially if it were busier. We ordered the Spring Rolls, she got a Large Pho, and I got a BBQ Lemongrass Pork Chop and Beef with Rice. The Spring Rolls were really good, and definitely left me wanting more! The rice was quite good, as the pork chop and beef were done quite nicely. I always find that the rice with these meals are always overly plain in comparison to the flavour of the meat. Would be nice to add a little spice to it. 

Service was quite good, quick on their feet, and very fluent in English (which is always a great plus)!

Not necessarily my first choice in cuisine, but wouldn't mind coming back here!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the rice and vermicelli dishes here. The deep fried spring rolls are also very good. Quite basic, but good value. Service for take-out is quick, friendly and they know me and my usual order over the phone."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to go for a bowl of Pho - pang, lang, djang as the Cantonese say! Try their rare beef noodle (or special beef) for Pho lovers, or if you're a fan of something meatier, their satays are quite good."}
{"text":"Service is always friendly and fast here. The food here is decent compare to the ones on hwy 7. The owner does speak some vietnamese with an accent just so u know. I always order the 2 or 3 items rice combo for a set price $18 for 2 or  $26 for 3 items. The food is alright but the portion is really tiny. I use to frequent this place alot because there isn't much choice around the area. My hubby loves pho and the pho here is not good but it's also not the worst. They are very skimpy with their food I guessing rent is high lol. Overall food is okay,service is good but being skimpy on food will get u a 3 stars in my book."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my parents recently. The food was flavourful, but really oily/greasy. 

We started off with spring rolls ($5.75) and all had the vermicelli. I had the spring roll and beef vermicelli $8.75, my mom had the spring roll, shrimp on a sugar cane and beef vermicelli $9.95 and my dad had the meat balls, shrimp on a sugar cane and beef vermicelli $9.95. Then my mom and I shared the Che Ba Mau (3 bean dessert) $4.25.

The spring rolls come 2 per order, but they are fairly large. However, I think still expensive for the price. They were really oily/greasy. They were also mostly taro, vermicelli, carrots and black cloud fungus; there was very little meat. They were crispy though, and while I think the wrapper was rice paper, since it was somewhat blistery, it actually tasted like a cross between rice paper and the usual wheat-based wrapper.

The vermicelli used in the vermicelli dishes are the big round vermicelli - like the diameter of spaghetti. It's not the smaller vermicelli - like the diameter of spaghetini (which I prefer). The bottom of the bowl is filled with bean sprouts. You also get some shredded lettuce and matchstick cucumbers, but not nearly as much as I would like. 

The beef was not grilled, but rather stir-fried with onions. It was tasty, but oh so oily/greasy. The shrimp paste on a sugar cane tasted like mostly flour filler, there did not seem to be that much shrimp. My mom felt that the meatballs were bland. Both meatballs and shrimp paste were also oily/greasy.

Dessert was pretty good though. The Che Ba Mau had black-eyed peas, mung bean paste, red beans, green gelatin strips, crushed ice and coconut cream. The beans/peas were perfectly cooked - not too mushy, but not too hard. The coconut cream was rich. The dessert was the right amount of sweetness. The ice could have been crushed a little bit more, but that's a minor issue.

Our server was very pleasant and friendly. It was super busy, so she didn't really check up on us, but she came when we called for her. 

Decor is modern. They didn't do such a great job cleaning the table before we sat down though. There was still some food on the table and the benches (we had a booth). I had to wipe it down with Kleenex from my purse.

The restaurant is in a strip mall, and there's lots of parking.

Overall, food was tasty but too oily/greasy for me to want to return."}
{"text":"I came here with the boyfriend because I was craving for Pho to cure a bad hangover.  We decided to try something different from our usual go-to Pho restaurant.  We walked in and were seated right away.  We were greeted by a nice lady who happened to speak English really well which helped a lot considering the both of us don't speak a word of Chinese.  After looking at the menu, we ended ordering an extra large house special, which we shared.  The menu has a wide variety of dishes and the other dish that caught my eye was their Curry (which I would like to come back next time to try).  The extra large Pho was very filling and we left us both stuffed by the time we finished the bowl.  When it comes to Pho, I'm very particular with the taste of the broth, the texture of the noodles and noodle choice, and the taste of the meats.  I was very pleased with all the above and I definitely recommend Pho Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Been here a few times before getting on Yelp. This place hasn't changed and neither has the people (some). However, prices has steadily been climbing. A S Pho is $6.xx, L is $7.xx and XL is $ 8.xx. I'd say that's pretty darn steep for pho because it isn't mind blowing delicious. Had the pad thai with chicken and a large rare beef/flank brisket pho. They were ok, not the best. I've had better pad thai at Thai Basil and Restoran Malaysia and the pho.. Tasted better at many places. Ohh well, I was too hungry to give a crap lol"}
{"text":"Good food terrible service We literally had to get our menus are selves and we had to YELL excuse me:("}
{"text":"The other reviews about the broth being super tasty here are no lie. The broth here is a lot better than other noodle places I have tried. My brother had very little msg tasting in it as well. I did'nt leave needing three cups of water. I ordered a brisket, tendon and tripe small pho which came up to 8.5 after tax. Decent price.

The service was super quick and like all other Asian establishments you got to hail them to get their attention but they are very responsive. They were super friendly with me to. I also didn't feel awkward sitting there eating alone LOL. Probably because it was lunch time and it was getting busy in there. That place packs up really quickly so I would try to get there right for 12 if you are coming from work for lunch. But the service for the food was quick too like within 5 minutes and it was steaming. 

Overall I would definitely come back to here no questions asked."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for many years, back before when it was Woodstone.  This restaurant continues to be a master of efficiency.  During lunch it is always packed, but they greet you right away and seat you immediately.  Tea is brought to the table within a minute of arrival.  Regardless of how busy it is, your order will be there within 10 minutes of ordering, often in 5 minutes.  It makes for a guaranteed quick sit down lunch.

The menu is a mix of Vietnamese and Thai.  None of the dishes are exceptional but they are all good, always fresh and hot.

I usually order either the Pho, for which there is a large selection of options, or the red curry chicken.  I get the roti instead of rice which is a welcome treat."}
{"text":"Pretty good thai food. I had the stir fried rice noodles with beef and bean sprouts and I enjoyed it. Excellent beef, pretty tasty noodles, slightly spicy (would have preferred a bit more spiciness, but not bad). Very quick service and the food probably came out km about 5 minutes. Very reasonable prices. Arrived at 11:55 and it was not busy but by 12:15 it was quite full. Atmosphere was not too loud."}
{"text":"I go to Pho Pad Thai often since it's close to my gym. Staff is really friendly and knows who we are, but even if they didnt, they always have a smile on their face and are polite to their customers. 

The food here is decent, but nothing special or outstanding. I do enjoy their curry dishes. The red curry was flavourful, creamy and a good amount of spicy. Their curry pad thai isnt spicy at all, but the flavours are ok. Their rice dishes are ok, but smaller than other Pho places nearby.

Prices are decent but possibly slightly more expensive than the average Pho place in Markham."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate friends birthday and was told the pho here was okay. Price was more expensive than normal but that just elevated my expectations. When the bowl came, it was a pretty big bowl but it appeared like they forgot that meat was part of the portion size.  They gave lots of noodles but skimped out on giving enough meat. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place one day at lunch since it was 5 minutes from the office and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. My staple is the House Special Beef Pho, it's the signature dish I try at all new Vietnamese restaurAnts. The key is in the broth. The prices are slightly higher than others but they do fill your bowl with all sorts of goodies AND you even have the choice of dry or fresh noodles!!! I've also tried their beef stew noodles and those are good too but the broth is pretty thick, I prefer a thinner broth. Their appetizer sampler is a combo of 5 different dishes, including their amazing mango salad - but it's quite pricey $27! During the weekdays this place is packed from 11am to 3pm but desolate on the weekends since it's mainly industrial and offices in the area. The only downside is the service, they are very slow with giving you a menu, taking your order and bringing your food. Took almost 10 minutes to get the bill so we walked up to the cash instead and even that didn't help with speed."}
{"text":"3.5, but I'll round up. We came at 9 pm last night for dinner. My mom and I shared a tomato, bean curd, spicy crab paste with pork vermicelli soup ($8.25), and a large avocado milk shake ($5.25). We were pleasantly full after, but my mom wasn't hungry when we went, so that might explain a part of that.

The spicy crab paste wasn't spicy, but there was a slight seafood undertone in my very tomato-ey broth. There were also tomato chunks. My noodles had 3 slices of some kind of Vietnamese ham, 3 shrimps, 3 pieces of bean curd, and 3 pork meatballs just slightly larger than your typical Italian wedding soup meatballs. I do wish this had been a tad stronger on the spicy crab paste, and a little less on the tomatoes. It was still good though.

And this is where reviewing gets tricky. I'd give my noodles a 3, but I'd give that avocado milkshake a 5. My mom asked that we get an extra cup so we could share the milkshake. They split it for us. These are the standard Vietnamese long drink glasses, and they filled both of them up basically 80% of the way. I have no idea how they would have done it in one glass, because we got a lot of avocado milkshake. The shake itself was very creamy, without chunks, and was generous on the avocado. I dislike my avocado milkshakes tasting like vanilla ice cream. This one did not taste at all of vanilla (they probably didn't put ice cream in it), and it wasn't too sweet. 

Service was prompt and for a Chinese-run place, quite pleasant. If I'm in the area, I wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"first time eating here. located in a plaza. came in at 12pm and it was almost pack. got a seat right away which was good cause after 15min there was a long line up for a table. order my go to small pho noodle that i always get and vietnamese spring roll. spring roll was meh. kinda mushy and it fell apart when i bit into it. pho was alright. took long to come out. 
 service was lacking a bit because it was a full house. overall not bad and would come back."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite pho place in markham and it's conveniently located right at the intersection of woodbine and applecreek! The parking is always ample due to the failure of the surrounding stores in the same plaza. I've never had trouble finding parking here, only trouble with the annoying and douchey scrubs that frequent master Q next door.

This is surprisingly a very popular place during lunch on the weekdays! I come here for my lunch break and apparently so does every single employee from every single company based in markham. People LOVE pho and who can blame them? It's delicious. The service is quick and the main boss lady gets shit down fast! However, there are some staff that operate on ZERO English and it's extremely difficult to communicate with her.. every time I order from here, I sit there praying that she isn't the one to take my order down because it wastes so much time- even when I'm only pointing to certain numbers on the menu. What the hell? 

Anyway, the pho is deeeeelicious! The broth is piping hot and tasty with little trace of MSG. The beef is soft and flavourful- exactly what I look for in a nice rare beef and flank pho soup. The noodles come either thick or thin- I choose thick and it is AMAZING. Texture of the noodles can make a girl fall in love. I always end up coming here whenever my coworkers and I are looking for a yummy place to go for lunch. My coworker also really enjoys the crispy chow mein here and indeed it is delicious. I've tried a bit and it was BOMB. Crispy noodles, flavourful beef and chicken.. HUGE dish! What more can you ask for?

No doubt, I will definitely return here.. soon.."}
{"text":"First time here, really good Pho! Curry is amazing too! Service is pretty good and overall environment is great!  I'm here with my pregnant wife and even with her drastic hormonal fluctuations and extreme negativity, she enjoyed every bit of it! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Almost everything here is good and relatively inexpensive. The service leaves much room for improvement, but still a great spot that gets crowded for the lunch-hour almost every day. 

Here's some suggestions for service:
- Do not move already seated patrons because you get a larger group.
- Do not handle just washed chopsticks by hand, even to dry them off. 
- Do not touch your face, particularly your nose area when you might touch my food. 
- Try to bring a table's food out together, as we plan to eat and leave together. 

Just missed 5 stars because of the above, things I've witnessed or experienced first hand."}
{"text":"We were frequent visitors when lived in the area, also perfect dinner after a long rock climbing workout at the Hub Climbing Gym right across the street. 
I like the pho , that is usually what we order. At some point we ordered the set dinner a few times and some other dishes, all were good. 
The restaurant is clean, waiters friendly."}
{"text":"Tried the Thai Green Chicken Curry and it was excellent. Service was also fast and they noticed me and my friend continued talking after we finished our dinner so they didn't rush us with the bill which was nice. Great atmosphere, wide selection of menu, and friendly staff would definitely make me return!"}
{"text":"This place is in the old Woodstone location. As someone who has gone to Woodstone a fair bit, it's easy to compare the two. While in this \"grand opening\" period, you get 10% off the bill.

The decor is newer with no more large circle tables. They have two large rectangle tables at the back for bigger groups. I think the layout makes things a little more open and makes more sense. It's also good to see the condiments all clean but we'll see how it turns out after a couple months.

The menu is huge, with food ranging from Vietnamese to Thai to some Hong Kong style food. The prices seem a bit higher than at the old Woodstone too.

I ate the Satay Beef Rice Noodles for $7.75. So a tip, apparently you can get thick or thin noodles, from what I can tell the thin noodles are fresher. I thought this would be satay beef on some soup noodle. But instead, it was a satay broth with some raw beef. Let me tell you, this beef was super red, gotta soak it in the soup to cook for a few minutes. I would have liked a bit more noodle in the bowl but there was a fair amount of beef, more than some other places. I'd call this Vietnamese Raw Beef Pho in Satay Broth. The flavor of the satay was quite spicy, lots of peanuts.

The menu said this place is special because they have Harmony and use less lard and oil. I don't know how that translate to my food though.

My friends ordered things from Curry Pad Thai, \"Special\" Pho, Grilled Beef/Pork with rice, they all looked decent but I think the pad thai smelt a bit burnt. I think they'll need to sort out some kinks.

One thing I wish they had, lunch combos with a drink. Too bad."}
{"text":"I don't like giving out five star ratings, but when you only expect mediocre, being surprised with an amazing dish merits a good rating.

I stopped in for a late lunch, not a busy dining room, maybe 2 other tables. The waitress was quick to greet an seat me. She was on the ball with the order and was prepared to allow me to take my time.

I ended up ordering the chicken pad Thai. It came to the table super quick, was very hot, flavourful, filling, and priced very reasonable at about $8.50. The salt and oil content is quite reasonable (pad Thai can get pretty oily when it's not cooked right) these guys did a fantastic job - I can tell by tasting the dish that the chef applied significant care when making it. I will definitely be stopping by again the next time I am in the area!"}
{"text":"1.5 star **

As a person who is a big fan of pho and viet food, eating my friends authentic viet pho and have been to quite a few pho places. I'm sorry to say this has not reached my mediocre standards. 

Yes the soup base was ok and there was options given in terms of thick or thin noodle. I like being given options. There was A LOT OF BEEF slices in the pho which i would give points for value. 

Also ordered the shrimp roll.. mehh... its a no no... didn't taste anything close to what my friend makes. The vermicelli had been overly soaked or cooked.. it was tooo thick. Not enough shrimps and i was charged 4.75$....nahh... 

Just when i thought this place was ok and I may come back.... I DISCOVERED A PIECE OF HAIR -LIKE item in my beef.... Arghhhh..... disgusting....that totally upset me.... I don't even want to think which body part it came from.... jus almost made me throw up....right in the bowl.... i mean i know restaurants in general aren't the cleanest but please don't make me sick like this. 

Not coming back... I'm sorry but that jus made me dislike pho pad thai...."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend about 2 weeks ago. On a Saturday. After a game of pool/ billiards. We arrived at 6pm, we got a booth seat. I ordered the Lemongrass pork-chop with rice. My friend ordered the lemon grass chicken with rice dish. We both ordered Hot Milk Tea as well. 

The food was good. The hot milk tea was good too. However the service, I felt they were rushing me out. The staff collected my friend's plate and hot milk tea cup. While I was still eating.  
It was a little busy, I understand that. However that rushed feeling while eating. That usually doesn't sit well with me. 
I'm not sure if I'll return when it's 6pm.  
Maybe at an earlier or later time, I'll try again. 
Overall, the food was good. The service was meh, especially during busy dinner rush hour time."}
{"text":"This is the best Pho. I love this soup and they have nice and full of meat and noodles."}
{"text":"Shrimp pad thai the best! You can actually see pieces of shrimp! good price for the serving size."}
{"text":"I'd like to update my review. This place is actually very fresh and delicious and service was on the ball when I came here for lunch the other day. very accommodating and very busy. the food was just done well. including the presentation with the rare beef in the pho being perfectly rare.

 broth nice and light and certainly worth the commute if you're nearby.

I'm was actually very pleased with it and almost shocked I gave this a 3. it's a 4.5 to me and given I can't select that I'll round up to 5.0.

good pricing too. everything under $10 still and you don't ever need to get the XL unless you're sure you'll finish a mammoth bowl of food. it's almost good to share to be honest.

The pad Thai here and the spring rolls are also well done. can't go wrong coming here."}
{"text":"We ordered a tomato crab meat viet noodles . My husband and daughter loved the flavour. I ordered a pork- egg grill chicken rice . The chicken tasted great and the meat was soft. They are nice, patient and courteous. Price is good compare to other viet restaurant in Markham . I am very pleased with the service! I will go there again and recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"I came for lunch with a big group of co-workers.  I ordered a pho which tasted okay and had sufficient meat.  The interior decor was average.  The service was quite good.  Our waitress smiled all the time.  She split bills for us without a fuss.  She was also fast with the credit card machine.  So this is an okay pho place with an efficient waitress at lunchtime."}
{"text":"The pad thai is delicious and consistent time after time. The portions are generous. Staff are friendly and food is prepared quickly. Parking however is alway an issue in this plaza."}
{"text":"***4.5 star***

Have been coming back here quite a bit lately.  I wonder if they improved their food as I see recent reviews are 4-5 star.  Brought friends here and they enjoyed it too.  Love their selection, service, seating area.  Somehow after they clean it though it smells like old damp towels."}
{"text":"Service is like a fast food burger joint. Food came within 5 minutes from ordering. The place was very busy on a Wed afternoon.

Beef skewers $5.50 - very yummy. 

Vermicelli with spring roll, shrimp ball and sugar cane $9.25 - Nice light meal

Red curry with chicken and roti $8.50 - The sauce had too much of a ginger flavour and the chicken chunks were not actual chicken cuts but processed chicken. Roti is $1 extra and you get two flat breads.  

I thought everything here was okay. Good for a quick meal but nothing that will WOW you."}
{"text":"Restaurant is clean. Food is decent. It's not as salty as some other pho places. There are a lot of choices on the menu. We didn't like the curry and the roti that much. Curry was a little bland and roti wasn't as flaky as we like. Service was slow, we were there after lunch rush so it wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Food was great. Server was terrible. She told us her name was Raina. She could not have been less pleasant, she seemed completely displeased that we had come to lunch 


I will think twice before coming back. 

The pho was good. But the service was bordering on unpleasant."}
{"text":"Been here more times than my check ins. Been coming to this place even before Pho Pad Thai opened. This place before was known as Woodstone which also cooked all similar items that Pho Pad Thai have on their menu currently. 

This is one my go to place for their Pork Chop w/ rice. I don't know what it is but I just love it! Been ordering that ever since Woodstone was still around and I'm glad they hadn't gotten rid of that either. I always remember the Pork Chop w/ rice was number S22 on the menu. 

This review will talk alot about the Pork chop w/ rice since it is one of my most eaten items at this place and until now. The pork chop has always been consistent with good sear, flavor and tenderness. Probably had a few bad pork chops here and there but mostly my experience with that dish has been positive for so many years. 

The 2nd item that I enjoy the most here is a Pho Pad Thai item which is their Red/Green curry w/ rice. Really enjoy their curry as it contains some coconut- flavor with a little cream which gives it a bit of a thickness and has a nice spice which gives some heated mixture when eating with the rice. The spicey-ness is the major factor because its not too hot to a point that its unbearable but its heats up your mouth quite a bit. 

The service here is really fast and efficient which is really good. Food comes within a few minutes. The lunch crowd is quite busy where all the business around the area come in for lunch. Food is consistent and tastes good with quick and speedy service and decent pricing.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Hmm this place is quite the bomb! The pho I find is quite good. Almost as good as my other favorite pho place! I've been getting the usual pho with rare beef. Nothing too special since been busy, but hmmm it's so good! Nice thick noodles and good beef! I will probably try the other rice dishes so give me time and I will tell! 

The place isn't too big, but it's a good size to hold a decent amount of people! The staff is friendly and quite fast or at least been fast for me! 
The parking lot can be quite packed so be warned!"}
{"text":"For starters, this place is NOT $$$. $$ is about right for this place, maybe even $.

Pho Pad Thai is a Chinese-run Vietnamese restaurant, so let's drop the authenticity discussion. For my visit, I decided to skip completely on the pho and went straight for the egg/rice noodle soup section, as I guessed I would enjoy my food better there.

I had the beef stew with rice noodle soup, and honestly...there's a fine line between tasty and salty when it comes to your broth. This place crossed the line; I never had that many cups of tea in my life. Good thing I had it for lunch and not dinner, cause otherwise I wouldn't have been able to sleep. The beef brisket and noodles were good, and for the cost of $6.75 it honestly was a \"you get what you paid for\" scenario.

The iced lemon tea was actually quite good, and I was particularly impressed by it, I'll say that much.

Service was...well...standard Asian level. Don't expect too much from it.

And will I be back? Meh. Good cheap, fill you up place, but there's better places."}
{"text":"Much better this time around.  Noodles did not stick this time and the broth was more flavourful then our previous visit.  They also gave complimentary a mango/coconut and jello dessert for us.  +1 overall!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite pho place. The pho is consistently good. The beef brisket curry with roti is awesome. The characteristic wet rag smell found in other pho restaurant was not an issue here. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a decent noodle place in the neighbourhood.  

If you are looking for authentic Thai or Vietnamese cuisine, you may be disappointed. I usually order the Pho and lemongrass pork chop rice. Price is decent and portion is big. Good thing is you can choose either dry pho or fresh pho. 

There are some combos which give you good value, but they are Cash and Dine-In only deals. 

Service is quick and polite. They take reservation for big group and usually give us dessert on the house at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"This place has become my go-to for pho. It is clean, bright and roomy which is not common for vietnamese restaurants. The service is good and quick, and the food is consistently good. I haven't found a stand-out dish that  I would crave (and I have from other pho places), but I like this one for its regular pho options and overall good quality food and service."}
{"text":"YUM! Tucked into a plaza with little traffic , Pho Pad Thai sure attracts a lot of pho lovers in the area. Not only they are clean, they also provide efficient service which is rare in Asian restaurants.

You'll find all your typical Thai and Vietnamese favorite dishes. All the yummy apps, to pho, stir fries, curry, and noodles. When you're at pho pad thai, of course you'll have to try either the Pho or Pad Thai.

I went with my usual in every other pho restaurants and got the sate pho ... with rare beef on the side. Not only I was pleasantly surpised they gave me a decent amount of protein, their sate soup is not your average pho beef broth base with chilli oil but a savoury soup that taste like it's been simmered for a long time - I'm blown away!"}
{"text":"I ordered my usual House Special Pho at Pho Pad Thai.

Good that there is a choice of fresh or dried noodle. The broth itself is quite flavoured with a great aroma of star anise and the portion is quite decent.

Service is fast and friendly. Though no lunch special available but the price is reasonable with a small pho at $6.50.

Pho Pad Thai might not be my usual pho joint, but it is clean and spacious so I definitely would be coming back here again."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to get pho! I often visit about twice a month. Each time my food is served quickly and every time it tastes delicious. Everything I've tried on the menu has been good so far from the pho rare beef to the fried spring rolls and green coconut curry! Prices are very reasonable here and service is always fast. The restaurant is always clean and always lives up to expectations!"}

Man, I was just DREAMING about the Bun Rieu Cua dish I had next to Great Mall in Milpitas, California and this week, my cravings were insupressable. I searched around and found Pho Pad Thai as the closest resto to my house that served this exact dish. Unfortunately, the dish failed to live up to the AMAZINGness I had experienced in California.

I'm giving Pho Pad Thai 3 just because I enjoyed the dining experience. The seating area is pretty spacious, the menu is extensive, and the servers were really really nice. They brought all the necessary utensils specific to the order we placed, and were pretty attentive while we were there.

The food however, wasn't the greatest (or maybe it's because the only viet places I've been to this year have received at least 4.5 stars on Yelp). 

House special Pho 3/5
- It tasted VERY standard. I'm starting to think there is some soup blend that average viet restaurants use because it tasted exactly the same as food court pho / xue lua. It didn't have the homey-ness that is captured by Pho Tai Bac or Little Saigon pho. They also give you braised bean sprouts as opposed to raw - I actually prefer it this way, but it definitely takes away the authenticity

Beef Pad Thai 3.5/5
Also very standard. Resembles the pad thai you get in the fast food chains that serve pad thai cafeteria style. It was very sweet and ketchupy. Good for kids.

Bun Rieu Cua (Tomato soup with crab paste rice noodles) 2/5
The soup was just really bland, and I could hardly taste the crab, let alone, see any ground crab meat.

BBQ Pork with steamed egg/grilled shrimp
Like the other dishes, the pork has the right flavour but very mild doses of it. 
The steamed egg is NOT a sunny side up egg you would kind of expect. Instead, it's like a savoury steamed omlette with minced veggies that tastes REALLY good. Sad I couldn't get a runny yolk, but still an interesting spinoff.

Food-wise, you will finish it, but you are not going to crave seconds."}
