{"text":"Fantastic pizza, salad, and lovely atmosphere. I can't say enough about how friendly and welcoming the entire staff was to us. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Upscale decoration, modern bright ambiance and  Good authentic Italian pizza. Worth a try..."}
{"text":"Stopped into this new place last night. Wow. I had been sad noticing quality slipping at my previous favorite place in market square and then this magical place appeared. I had these insane tasty little potato fritters with just the right amount of cheese inside. They were great. Not sure what they were called but I'm glad I tried them. Then I had Margarita pizza that was way better than I had even hoped. My friend with me had a Marinara Pizza ( no cheese ) which I thought was crazy until I tried it and then saw the wisdom there. It was made with sauce and garlic and was phenomenal. They are brand new but the food seems already perfect and they seem to know what they are doing really well. High recommend for anyone who loves the oven fired pizza."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite brick/wood oven style pizza place in Pittsburgh. The price is really outstanding (like half as much as il piazolla and proper) and the pizza is of the same quality as the higher priced Options. Particularly a fan of the rapini And sausage white pizza. The risotto balls are all really tasty.  The other bonus is the sparkling water is free!   Also good spot to go before a show, because it doesn't seem to fill up and you don't need reservations."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place when walking off of Market Square. The aranchino selection drew our attention. The place was clean and bright and modern. We weren't super hungry so we had salad and selections of aranchino. They were the perfect bite-size so we could try different flavors. The salad was fresh with roasted peppers. Perfect light dinner. I'd imagine if we were hungry, the pizzas would be delicious too."}
{"text":"Whoa! This is the Italian street food joint that has been missing in the Pittsburgh food scene. Had the Margherita DOC and the quality of ingredients was impressive for a $12 pizza. Can't wait to try their other combinations... love that they have a patate (potato) pizza! Their fried arrancini are as good or better than the more expensive options around the city, and they have a wider variety of these arrancini/suppl√¨/panzerotti than anyplace I've been outside of Italy."}
{"text":"So I'm a little embarrassed to say that after coming here my first day in town we came back every day we were here( four times) it deliciously good pizza with high quality ingredients. You won't be disappointed. Only one size of pizza. One will lightly fill two people two pizzas would stuff two people on average"}
{"text":"The pizza is great! I had the Sofia and if I could, I'd get it at least once a week. Unfortunately, the restaurant isn't a block or two from my apartment and they don't deliver. There are at least a dozen other pizza restaurants that are much closer to me and which are open later (like after a show downtown).  I hope Pizzuvio does well--the food is good quality and truly authentic. I just wish they would make themselves more accessible to downtown residents and downtown arts denizens."}
{"text":"Excellent!! The dough is authentic and the tomato sauce is amazing. Very good service. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Went for lunch. And had the Bianca with sausage. The pizza came out really quickly and was hot. Loved that they have not only grated parm and pepper flakes, but also hot oil. I also asked for a side of sauce (my pizza didn't have it on it) and they brought some with no problem. The space is bright and really welcoming, and the people are friendly. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food Little Italy in Pittsburgh!!! A must try  Rice balls just like my familia bravo!!!"}
{"text":"This is yummy hand made artisan pizza. The interior is modern clean, hip and chic. They play modern hits and club music.  This is the best pizza I've had in downtown Pittsburgh.  I ordered the Marinara with garlic, meatballs and cheese. It was delicious. This is a mostly build your own pizza place but they have a list of their own.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Pizzuvio serves the kind of pizza that will haunt your dreams after.  That chewy, crispy crust...I just...ugh.  It's so hard to find good Neopolitan pizza like this.  I didn't intend to eat the entire thing in one sitting, but I did--and I wasn't sick or stuffed or groggy afterwards.  I just kept thinking of that pizza for the rest of the day and how I'm looking forward to going back.  I also got a few of the appetizers, which were okay.  I had suppli in Rome several years ago, and the suppli amatriciana that I got here wasn't quite up to that level.  (Not that it was bad.)  The restaurant itself is pretty cool; it's got a very crisp, clean feel, which is a little incongruous when you think pizza and street food, but it worked.  Great downtown addition to the other quick service places that serve customized meals (e.g. V3, Simple Greek, Chipotle, etc.)"}
{"text":"Super high quality pizza, clean, and very relaxed atmosphere. I'm a big pizza fanatic and this place is top notch."}
{"text":"Pizzuvio is everything I had hoped it would be; Neapolitan style pizza at a reasonable price! The interior is beautiful and modern. You can never go wrong with marble and industrial vibes.   If you are in the mood for Arancino balls, they have a great selection of these fried rice balls. They also have a great selection of specialty pizzas, all of which are under $12. If you are looking for a little dessert after your meal, they also sell Leona's ice cream sandwiches. It is really the perfect spot for lunch if you want to dine in or take it out, its super quick. The specialty pizza that I tried was the Bianca Verda. This was topped with ricotta, spinach, tomatoes, mozzarella and parmigiano. The dough was light and the pizza had a lot of flavor. The only thing I would recommend if you order this pizza is to maybe ask that they cook it a little longer. The reason I say this is because spinach can cause the dough to be a little too soft in the center. Other than that, it's a tasty pie! I will definitely be coming here for lunch a lot in the future."}
{"text":"Pizzuvio is a new pizza spot downtown. The ambiance was very pleasant. Definitely a nice spot to meet for lunch. I enjoyed my pepperoni and sausage pizza. It came pretty quickly and was more than I expected. It had 8 slices, so I definitely could have shared with someone. Only downside was the pizza had a lot of oil coming from it. I'm assuming it was from the meat. As others have said, the crust is delicious! I'll go back!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to downtown! I haven't worked downtown in almost a year and decided to spend the evening down there.   While waiting for our table at another place we stopped here to check it out and grab a snack. The shop was so bright, welcoming and clean.   I ordered The Suppli Amatriciana which has  bacon, tomato sauce and Pecorino-Romano. For under $3 it was a great snack and tasted great. The wait was a little long but the counter girl explained whenever she delivered it that he first was burned.   Other items that they offered were pizza. Maragrita pizza was about $8. A good size personal pizza or could easily be split. I believe it was a 4 cut. They also offer calzone.. Fried or baked. Plus a half calzone half margarita pizza item.  Decor is chic with black and white.. Adorable pops of red and trendy seats and accessories.  Kudos to the designer. Love it  My rice ball was great. I intend to stop back for pizza!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I just made it here last week! Went in for lunch on a Friday and first I want to say the woman who took our order was a gem. She was so nice and remembered my name throughout our whole visit. The pizza was actually better than I was expecting. I'm always a bit iffy when places claim to serve neopolitan style pizza. But it was great! The dough honestly knocked my socks off and it came out very quickly.   OH and they serve Leonas!"}
{"text":"Wow. I have had pizza in Venice Italy and tried the brick fired pizzas from other places in Pittsburgh. I must say hands down this is my favorite. The location and decor cannot be beat. The order taker is always smiling and she gets you through fast. I really enjoy the Salumiera, once you have tried it you will dream about when you can go again all week. I had to come 3 times this week to get my 'fix', it is that good. I requested for for my salad on the side not on the pizza and wanted my pie to not be sliced just like they do in Italy. They obliged with no issues. Try this place you will not be disappointed, great addition to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We had the Diavola and it was simply the best pizza we have ever enjoyed and we love pizza. We are from out of town and sad this place is so far away but thankful we got to enjoy it. Not to miss!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to downtown Pittsburgh! This place kills it. Working downtown we definitely have a lot of pizza options but I don't feel like we had affordable pizza options for 1 person. Sure you want a whole pizza for you and a few coworkers then you have plenty of options. But if you wanted a small, affordable pizza just for you the only option was v3.  A coworker and I went here one Friday for lunch and we were both blown away. The place itself is absolutely stunning. Everything on the menu sounds amazing so it's hard to just pick one. The first time I went I got a basic margherita pizza and it was amazing. I'm not a big crust eater but this place has the most amazing dough that I ate the crust. The pizza was not overpriced and it was definitely a good size. I have been telling everyone about this place ever since that day. If you haven't checked out Pizzuvio yet, you definitely need to."}
{"text":"Couldn't believe how great this place was! Forgive the comparison but it's like the Chipotle of pizza. Walk in, order, sit down, and the food gets brought too you. In my opinion it's super legit Neapolitan style pizza and I couldn't believe the selction of arincini. I haven't seen anything like it since Rome. I didn't understand the tipping policy wasn't sure if I should tip or not or where to. Oh they also have Leona's!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. I went here for lunch a few days ago.  Got the prosciutto & arugula pizza.  I wanted to add tomato sauce and they said no, kind of weird.  Didn't have to wait long for my pizza to be ready which was a positive.  Once I got my pizza, I was surprised.  The dough was extremely soggy.  Like doused in olive oil in a bad way and not a hint of crisp from a hot oven.  I didn't even finish my pizza, which I never leave uneaten pizza.  Also was not thrilled with the amount of prosciutto.  Not enough to to have prosciutto with each bite, which to me is not enough.  Maybe this time was a fluke... service is fast enough that I would consider trying again."}
{"text":"Great pizza, got the blanca with sausage, crust was cooked perfectly, nice crunch on the outside but still soft on the inside. I would preferred a bit more sausage."}
{"text":"Wow, I shouldn't have waited so long to try this place. I got a 4 pack of rice balls, and everyone of them was a winner. My favorite was the Frittatina, Noodles, cheese and ham all put together and fried was awesome! They were all crisp on the outside with rice that was still in good shape, hadn't been cooked to oblivion. They are only a buck a piece, so I got lunch for under 5 bucks and I feel pretty satisfied with the amount of food I got. This will definitely become part of my lunch rotation!"}
{"text":"Ron Molinaro, of Il Pizzaiolo, does it again with Pizzuvio. \"New Neapolitan\" style pizza is the staple here, and it's not to be missed!   Tried out Pizzuvio with a group of about 12 coworkers on Friday. The atmosphere is chic but casual and very bright and inviting. Fans of Il Piz will recognize a lot of the offerings; from the pizza to the arancini to the mista salad. The difference here is that Pizzuvio is more of a fast casual spot where you order at the counter and then decide between dining in or taking to go. Either way, the quality is there. This is a true gem in downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Perfect.  Pizzuvio is great. The perfect blend of speed and delight that you could ask for, whether you go for lunch, a snack or dinner Pizzuvio does it right. You can pop in, grab a pie and run. You can sit down and enjoy a casual dinner without losing the quality.   My colleagues and I stopped by for lunch, my arancino funghi was out within minutes and was hot and delicious and oozed the cheese, a lovely lava, when I cut it(check out the photo). Simply put, it's a ball rice cheese and mushroom fried to perfection and a perfect appetizer or addition to a salad. My diavola(photo) pizza came out moments after and was just great. Nice spice, delicious thin cut salami crisped just right.   What I like best about Pizzuvio is that it's your \"italian style\" pizza that most people associate with upscale restaurants, but served quickly as a street style food. They've adopted the pay first, enjoy (shortly) after style that Gaucho Parilla has with the same tremendously on point delivery; Timely, tasty and fresh.  As far as pricing goes, it's pretty spot on considering portions and freshness of ingredients respectively; If you think it's expensive, have a $4 Peroni (they have beer and wine) and pipe down, Pizzuvio is on point.   I'll be back...like 12 more times till I've had everything."}
{"text":"I heard that Pizzuvio was coming dtwn a year & a half ago, and when I noticed it was finally here I was super jazzed to try it. The inside of the place looks beautiful, very clean and current design. The concept is Neopolitan pizza and street food, served in the timeframe of fast food. Apparently 90 seconds to cook the pizza. It's from the pizza genius behind il Pizzaiolo, so you know it's gotta be great. I tried the Margherita D.O.C, which was like the standard Margherita except it had Mozzarella di Bufala instead of regular, and also Parmesan cheese. It was super fast, and looked delicious.... however definitely left something to be desired. The crust wasn't nearly as crunchy as expected, and disappointingly, the center of the pizza was just lukewarm. I also tried the arancino funghi, which is a fried ball of rice with cheese and mushrooms inside, served on a bed of marinara sauce. There a a few different varieties as well. When I cut into it tho, the center was also still cold. D'oh! I asked for it to be warmed up, and the staff was really nice and helpful, but when they brought it back (actually brought a whole new one) it was better, but STILL not hot on the inside. It also could have used more sauce than the tablespoon that came with it. So honestly, in general I was kinda disappointed. They just opened a month ago, so I imagine are feeling things out and working out the kinks of a new business/concept right now. And, I'd be totally fine with it taking a little longer if it was as good as il Pizzaiolo. Will definitely be back to try again in a few weeks!"}
{"text":"Awesome, well-priced pizza. Tasty, cheap snacks (arancini). Beautiful space - the decor is phenomenal for a counter-service place. Much higher-end all around (quality of food, quality of ambience) than you'd expect for the price point - even the napkins were high-class! A phenomenal addition to downtown. Go there immediately!"}
{"text":"Recently opened in the downtown busy area around Market Square, it is quite an addition to the city restaurant scene. It is a you-queue-and-order-and-take-a-seat place, where the pizzas are cooked in 3 minutes in the wood-fired ovens (two of them !!) and carried to you by waitresses that find your table number sign.  The walls are covered with large modern art paintings, the tables and fixtures are modern but warm, and the food quality is excellent.  What is surprising is that the prices are not high, but geared for the lunch crowd.  And that is why the place was full of young office workers.  We ordered a trio of pizzas: - Pizza Pizzuvio - Pizza Margherita D.O.C. - Pizza Marinara  The Pizzuvio ($10) is half calzone and half Margherita, merged together in a seamless union (neat idea !!).  The interior of the calzone is mostly ricotta milk cheese, with some salami and ham, and a few sliced cherry tomatoes.  The dish that was served to us seemed a bit smaller than others that I saw in other tables (see the photo and you can see the white brim of the dishware on the perimeter), but I guess I was the unlucky one to get the smaller of 'em all.  The Margherita D.O.C. ($12) is a version of the regular Margherita ($8) but with premium bufala mozzarella.  Baked to perfection, the dough was clearly prepared the day before and fermented and raised to acquire the best flavor.  Thank you for bringing back the true pizza Napoletana to Pittsburgh (the first honors goes to the veteran of 'em all, Roberto Caporuscio, who started in Pittsburgh his culinary adventures over a decade ago).  The Marinara ($7) is a very thin crust tomato sauce and garlic oven-baked circular flat bread, with flavoring of oregano.  Delicious and tasty.  I would have added a free option of just a few bits and pieces of anchovies (\"acciughe\") but I understand that for American tastes, that would have been very difficult to accept.  Overall, quite an establishment.  I just love 'em crowds at lunch, boisterous, eating, chatting. And rushing back to the office. It's a movement.  It's an ocean current.  Its fast but good. Sure, it would be nice to have a few Fiaschetta di Vino, but, alas, here in America, that is not allowed."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience ... I couldn't have asked for a better meal for lunch.    Antipasta salad, couple meatballs and a slice of pizza from my buddy.  Perfect !!  Couldn't be more happy"}
{"text":"As a pie connoisseur, Pizzuvio is pretty good! Had their Margherita D.O.C. and I'm curious as to the difference with just their regular Margeherita. Good flavors, just wish there was more basil on this puppy. A solid pizza choice! And their prices are decent!"}
{"text":"This was great Neapolitan pizza served in a casual upscale spot. Really amazing pizza. I prefer Neapolitan style and have had many across the county and this was in the top 3 ever. Really great!"}
