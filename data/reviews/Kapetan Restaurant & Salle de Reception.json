{"text":"I live in the area, and this restaurant has been a frequent spot for a few years. My mother and I liked to get together here during the week for dinner, or on weekends for breakfast.   Yesterday, we walked over for breakfast. It started alright, sat down, got water and menus. We had to ask for the breakfast menu. We ordered, eggs, bacon, sausage, beans. The waitress forgot one of our coffees, we had to ask for that again.   The meal came, it was alright. Surprisingly large portion of old, over cooked bacon, eggs that looked old, but we did not expect much.   As I take a fork-full of beans, and begin to chew, I suddenly bite down on something very hard. I take it out of my mouth, and it was a rock. Unmistakeable. It was small and grey and sharp and hard. The kind that you might see on a gravel road.   I call the waitress over, and advise her that I found a rock in my food. She doesn't seem shocked. She just took it in the back to advise the cooks. She came back out, took a payment from another client before coming back to my table, and when she came back, she said \"Sorry, but we order the beans from a company, they come to us like that, not our fault\" and asked if I wanted something in it's place. I said no, because I was pretty off my meal at that point. I picked at the fruit on the plate and some potatoes for the rest of the meal.   The bill came, and there was no discount, no complimentary anything... Just handed me a full bill. Not in the mood for an argument, I paid and left immediately.   I will not be returning here ever again."}
{"text":"Kapetan is a nice family restaurant that we do not see much of in the great Montreal surrounding.  The good: Good hot warm food. Good portions. Prices are not that high, it is pretty affordable. Service is usually warm and nice. You might see food you never heard before (turnip and maple syrup soup? It was actually good).   The bad: If you sit close to the entry door, it can get cold in winter. You have to share the bathroom with the folks from the reception hall (never been a fan of those). All the tv's are on the same station (and I hate anything TVA related). Can be loud at moments.  The verdict: The bads are minor versus the goods. Definitely give this place a try."}
