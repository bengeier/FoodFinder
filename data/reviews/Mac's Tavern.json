{"text":"Best Wings  on the local snowmobile trail !  A few Buddies and I toured several bar/Taverns from Garrettsville to Parkman to Bainbridge and Troy. over the last weeks. On a search for the BEST Wings..... The season is young, hoping for more snow.   Right now Mac's is serving some of the largest bar wings around. When we stopped in the other Sunday we saw a few plates go out. Then they sold out. So last night a few of us rode sled in (Mac's right on trail!) and they were back in stock a big and tasty. 
   Friendly staff and good people.  Pool table and Big Screens"}
