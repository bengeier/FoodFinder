{"text":"I've been to a lot of restaurants..and if I had signed up on Yelp sooner I would have reviewed them all..but am soon going to catch up. I've been to very pricey places..that does not deter me, however this place was almost on the ridiculous side. 

High prices for sub-mediocre food!

The rice/paella was flavourless, my mussels were a bit off too. I could of had tastier rice in Chinese take-out. That's not supposed to be a joke. That's true.

$30 for a paella for one.$30 for rice. and it was not good. not even \"ok\".

On Saturday's they offer suckling pig..mmmm.im thinking warm, juicy, suckling pig. $14 for a small tapas! NOPE! COLD! DRY! arrrrgh. I had read the bad reviews before going, but wanted to give the place the benefit of the doubt.

And yes..the other reviews are true..there is Arabic dancing as well as the Spanish dancing..which I must say, was the best part of the night! The girls did a great job entertaining. 

..but seriously..don't bother eating here. there are a million restaurants nearby that will probably be more enjoyable."}
{"text":"This is the second Spanish restaurant I went in Toronto. It was pretty close to my new place and, after reading website that the restaurant offered flamenco and belly dancing show on Friday, I decided to go. I read reviews on yelp about the place but they were not too encouraging: people were complaining about food quality and price. All the bad reviews were dated 2012, 2013 and newer were much better, I hoped that it would be good considering I'm not too picky person.
Unluckily all the bad reviews turned out to be true:-( I'm not complaining about price, usually you know it before you go so you know what to expect. Food was kind of tasteless and definitely price was too high for this quality. The other disappointing thing was that the flamenco dancers did not show up! We asked the server, he just kept apologizing. Then the belly dancer showed up, it was the worst and the most amateur dancing! 
The restaurant is pretty expensive, they could at least hire responsible and more or less good dancers!
If you want to try a good paella I would recommend Tapas at Embrujo."}
{"text":"I am really surprised at the reviews written.  I went here with a girlfriend of mine and thought it was great.  

Yes, it could be considered pricey, but the portions for the 2 of us was perfect. Obviously if you go with 4 or more people you are going to have to order more - but that is the same as anywhere. If you want an overflowing plateful go to a chain restaurant with pub food.

Everything was flavourful. We had stuffed figs (which were awesome) and a paella which was great - just to name a couple. 

The service was friendly but yet they knew when to step back when our conversation got heavy.

So... Yay, I'm a fan. (and no I don't know the owners!!)"}
{"text":"Simply put, we had never eaten there but were blown away with how terrific everything was.  For the area we didn't find the price outrageous.  We had a true variety of items, but the beef stew was portioned perfectly and just melted in my mouth.  The homemade Chorizo sausage was incredible and sautéed to perfection.  My wife had the seafood medley and caramelized onion goat cheese and was equally as impressed.  Everything was topped with their Churros and Dulce de Lecce dipping sauce which was just the perfect finish to a tasty dinner."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Casa Barcelona about 4 times and each time the quality seems to have slipped a little more, to the point where I would not recommend it at all.

Very friendly staff.  But pricey, and very iffy-quality."}
{"text":"We stumbled onto this place around 8:30 pm on a slow Tuesday evening. Given the funky/slightly tacky decor, my first impression was to wonder  whether we had made a mistake. We had not!  Admittedly the prices on the menu look a bit on the high side, but the quality of the food was excellent, making it good value for money: crunchy stuffed olives, homemade chorizo, beautiful Serrano ham, a perfect fluffy Tortilla Española with its sweet onions still h a faint crunch, fat eggplant rolls stuffed with peppers and goat cheese (outrageous!), and a tiny paella with its flavors melded but not muddied. We found the house wine, a 2010 red Rioja, to be delicious. At that late hour on a weeknight, the place was empty and the owner talked with us at length - the man knows his wines.

I can see that this place wouldn't appeal to everyone; it's not a concept restaurant with open kitchen and hip furnishings. But it was great food and a great find. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing. The food is delicious. There's a huge menu full of tapas to die for, and almost everything on the menu is homemade. There's an amazing drinks list. You can tell that the owners take pride in their restaurant. Great service, the owners are very polite. And on the weekends they even have live entertainment! I recommend this restaurant to everyone, it is by far my favourite place in the city."}
{"text":"We had wonderful time in this restaurant with our friends. I love their idea of tapos, or small dishes you can share at the table. This way you can try more food and not overeat. Everything we tried was  delicious. My favourite was eggplants with goat cheese. Devine!
We met the owner, he was very friendly, had great sense of humour and recommended a few dishes that we all enjoyed.
The food is on the solty side which seems to be usual for Spanish food, so keep this in mind if you are on a special diet."}
{"text":"I went to Casa Barcelona for dinner and found it to be over priced, under delivered and not authentic.  The presentation was amateur, quality of the dishes was low and the taste was bland.  No surprise they were empty on one of the busiest evenings of the year.  Do not waste your money on this place as there are so many better spots in the same neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The restaurant had a very low key non formal environment, almost like being at grandma's house.  We had a tapas combo for two with 3 glasses of wine and the bill came to over $120. The food was interesting but a little greasy and very small portions.   Given the quality, quantity and pricing of the food I wouldn't recommend this spot."}
{"text":"We visited the restaurant last spring, hoping for some great Tapas. We were disappointed as we ordered one of their variety items. A lot of the food was bland, and much too greasy. We weren't impressed, especially when the bill came and was over $75 (probably even higher) and all we ordered was the food... not even drinks. We wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Spectacular wine list with amazing prices. If you are a wine person this place is a must. Food is very good, very authentic.  I will be going again."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic tapas great service. Definitely worth checking out this cozy little gem"}
{"text":"We come here from time to time, (not as often as we would like because it is a bit far for us).  The tapas are fantastic!   Their Tapas menu is huge (which can be overwhelming when going here for the first time but once you try them you'll love them!)  Paella is tasty and very well served. The Churros are amazing.   Service is good, particularly when the owner is out and about chatting with people and making them feel at home (when he's not out and about he's cooking in the kitchen).  Their Live Entertainment is truly a treasure:  Live Flamenco dancers AND Bellydancers.  The Flamenco dancers are good, the bellydancers are phenomenal, some of the best bellydancing I've seen.  Sometimes they also have a singer/musician.  They are also attentive to children.

Update 2017, unfortunately the entertainment is not longer what I wrote in my first review a few years back.... Shame!  :("}
{"text":"If I could put no star or minus star I would.
Food IS horrible and super pricy. I ordered seafood Paella , came after 5 minutes, the portion was size of one egg omelet, like palm of my hand. Tasted like Chinese fast food oily and salty. Price was $16. Attitudes was unbelievable. Almost empty on Saturday night, except 3 table only were occupied and a push to finish and leave. Even once the server wanted to remove the plate while still eating at around 8:30pm. Worse a senior lady and gentleman maybe more in charge had such a difficult and rude way of speaking to us. I would not accept even to eat for free there."}
{"text":"Overpriced and bland food. The paella was just ingredients put together. Nothing taste good."}
{"text":"Felt like eating at a day old buffet. I think calling something gross is a lazy description but that's how I felt about the food. I honestly don't understand the raving reviews, does it depend on who's working that night?

Potato dish was soggy oil soaked hash browns with incredibly spicy aoeli. Two thumbs of chicken came out with frites that were overcooked on the outside but hard raw potato on the inside. That was bizarre! We also had a bread dish, a seafood dish and a veggie dish. Two hungry men and we only finished the bread dish. All bland, soggy, cold. 

Finally the cost. $12 for a 6oz glass of cheap Aussie wine in a cloudy glass was, in hindsight, not surprising at a place where you write down your own order on scrap paper. We had five small dishes and two glasses of wine for $115. Went down the street for burgers afterward."}
{"text":"The most complicated menu I have ever seen. Overpriced and sadly despite the owners efforts low quality food.  First and last time for me."}
{"text":"Service is fast and friendly. I've been here a few times food is always tasty and quick. Tapas style really feels like your somewhere in Spain!!! The have Spanish dancers on the weekends and serve Roasted suckling pig."}
{"text":"Came here once for dinner with my family. The fish was undercooked (it was cold in the middle, so they most likely reheated an old dish) and the food was horrible my mother found a hair in the food. The waitress was also incredibly rude, and didn't look after us very well. After we paid and when we were leaving, the waitress came up to us and said we had to tip her since we gave her nothing due to our incredibly horrid service. She blocked us from exiting and she stood in front of the door and asked us to tip her. We explained that 1) the food was frozen, we're not stupid, we know you reheated it 2) there was a hair in our food 3) the somewhat warmish food didn't even taste that good 4) the service was horrible and 4) the fact that the server is not letting us leave until we tip her is so rude and unnecessary.  Not sure if Toronto Public Health should check this place out.  Here's a tip Casa Barcelona: SHUT DOWN."}
{"text":"I should have checked Yelp before visiting this place. It was incredibly expensive and the food was just OK and lukewarm.  I would not recommend this place... there are far better Restaurants for two people to spend +$150 on dinner"}
{"text":"I don't usually write review in yep, but for this spot I must. This is the very unforgettable and worst place I have ever been. First the food is just taste miserable, the sea food tapas taste like the mixed frozen seafood pocket you bought from Walmart in a very cheap price, and it smells, and unclean,you can taste the sands definitely. The worse thing than the seafood tapa is the seafood rice. Same, it made by those mixed frozen seafood,the clams and shrimps are very small, the scallop are dry. And the rice taste insanely horrible, I guess they just put all the things together. Even I can make it better than that, but the last thing to surprise you is the seafood rice cost me more than 70dollars, 70 dollars, I rather eat Chinese fast food than that!  And over all the environment is crappy and old, the menus is vey hard to read, in 8pm of Saturday the whole place are just empty. Don't waste you money and time, highly not recommend! For those who recommend it, you don't have heart!"}
{"text":"Must concur with other two reviewers.  We just went for a light supper and bill was huge.  In order to purchase a full dinner, you're out about $75 a person.  Tapas portions were small, typically three items to a plate rather than five.  Tasty, but not outstanding given the high prices.  One of our party found the stuff bull's head with matador swords in it definitely unnerving while eating - perhaps they should use the swords to cut some of their menu prices instead!

We won't be back."}
{"text":"I went with a large group for dinner one evening and we had a really enjoyable time. Though some of the group ordered individual entrees, the rest of us decided to partake in our servers offer to bring out a variety of dishes rather than individually choose what we wanted. This was perfect for us because the menu is very extensive and we had no idea where to start, much less how much we should order. We ended up with the perfect amount of food. The standout dishes where the garlic shrimp, the chorizo, and the cheese croquettes. By the time the large paella dish came around most of us were already pretty full, but we thoroughly enjoyed that dish as well."}
{"text":"First time at this Tapas place. The decoration is as expected for a traditional Spanish Tapas restaurant. You will definitely feel like you were in Spain. We had the Sangrias and that was actually good; followed by 6 tapas items - 2 Shrimps and garlic butter (nothing special about that) 2 shrimp ceviche with avocado it could of been tasty but there was wayyy to much onions. Last two items were the raise beef cinnamon and the choice bacon stuffed dates...that was tasty but I could do without the dates ~ that was a bit to sweet for my liking."}
{"text":"We ordered four dishes and I would say one was wonderful, one was tasteless and two were just okay. The service was fine, but I wouldn't say friendly.  The atmosphere was very European, clean but a bit dated.  I can only say it was okay.  However, I would give it another try if I was in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I know this place has bad reviews. I will agree that the food is a bit overpriced BUT I really liked the mussels & garlic shrimp. I LOVED the duck. I will go back just for that. The sangria was ok as was the paella. I'm glad the bad reviews didn't scare me away. I've paid more for food way worse than this. This is close to where I live & I will return.

I had 2 glasses of sangria. There were 3 of us. We ordered bread (extra), appetizer portion of paella, mussels, garlic shrimp & duck. It came to $40 per person including tax & tip."}
{"text":"Food is great and the service is quite enjoyable treated like a family member here! They chat with Ya even if you are not known here and waaaa...music and great ambience they stay open until No more guests."}
{"text":"Very promising intro by owner (?) about wine cellar this while staring out the window (inspiration?) we were not in the 60$ and up price per bottle league so we get a waitress who did not know anything about wine. On the question where the wine was from she gestured 'Europe'. The menu is very confusing and has a million items.  The bill was high, tapas,  but have to give it a second try for the paella. Dubious place."}
{"text":"Decently seasoned. Fresh and hot delivery. Sure the quantity isn't what you'd get at a chain restaurant, but it is QUALITY. Paella had large amounts of chorizo and chicken. The tenderloin was tender and was perfectly cooked. The spanish omelette was light and fluffy and filled with deliciousness."}
