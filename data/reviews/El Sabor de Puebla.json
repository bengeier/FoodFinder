{"text":"Authentic mexican food in Wisco doesn't often go this deep. Cooking with organic ingredients when available, sourced from this family's own hard work, this is a unique opportunity to try some of the great foods loved by many. I appreciate the rare glimpse into southern Mexico (think Puebla and Oaxaca). Their Mole, tamales, salsas, etc are a must try. If you haven't enjoyed this food at the northside and hilldale farmers markets (though they still run a tamales and burritos/tacos stand at these markets), dive into this great food seven days a week on Willy Street."}
{"text":"Solid choice for authentic Mexican food. It was pretty slow for a Thursday lunch, but the service and speed was excellent. Food was very flavorful - huaraches had a hit of spice that added interest but not heat. Will definitely be back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"I had the saucy burrito, which I enjoyed from the first smell (rich, garlicky) to the last bite (deep flavors with a clean finish). None of that post-burrito coma I have gotten used to. While I did not dine in the restaurant (I opted to pick-up), the atmosphere seemed bright and cheery."}
{"text":"BEST Authentic Mole sauce with flavor that is deep w/ a bit of spice... and Flavorful (masa) tamales!   The space is very small, it gets busy fast.  The service can be so-so as stated- Come with a relaxed mind-set and you will enjoy the offerings if you like REAL Mexican food."}
{"text":"I recently went there because I absolutely love Mexican food and I am always up for a new restaurant, especially Mexican!  I don't know if they are still figuring out their kinks or not, but the food wasn't that good. The meat was really dry and there wasn't too much flavor. Our table tried 6 different dishes and we all felt the same about the meat and flavor.   The chips and salsa were really good but as someone said before in their review, they don't really give you a great amount verse other places that I have been before.   The staff was friendly, but there was a good amount of errors which is completely normal for any new business. With time, they will hopefully get better.   One thing to note is they do not serve alcohol, so if you are looking for margaritas this isn't the place.   Overall, cute place and nice staff but pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"They were right as far as Service not being so good.  Only around 6 people on Sunday afternoon and took almost 45 minutes to be served.  The food was so so.  Would not come back."}
{"text":"This is a great Taco joint. They also have very good tortas, taquitos dorados, pozole on the weekends.  Salsa as are great.  They specialize in aguas frescas and have great agua de Jamaica, tamarindo, piña, pepino etc depending on the season and what's fresh.  We come here about once a week.  Very good prices."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem. Their food is excellent. We were going to go to another restaurant for Thanksgiving but the wait was very long. We were so lucky to come across El Sabor de Puebla. When we walked in there seemed to be a celebration of sorts. The staff told us to choose a seat, they were serving turkey dinner. They brought my husband and me a large plate with some of the most delicious turkey I have ever eaten. Included was a perfectly cooked chicken leg  & small potatoes. The saute vegetables and pasta & cheese were perfect. What a pleasant surprise. We were then offered hot chocolate or horchata. To top it off, we were served a slice of handmade apple/pumpkin pie with homemade whipped cream. The owners generosity was unprecedented. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. Their unique and yet familiar flavored food is delicious. Stop by and enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service (they were moderately busy but were greeted and food was prompt). We had enchiladas with mole sauce and chicken fajitas; both were ample portions, well-seasoned, with rice and beans on the side. Guacamole was fresh and worth ordering, although the house salsa is nice and spicy. Would definitely recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican fare. Their chicken mole brought back memories of my host family's version in Cuernavaca: a nutty and aromatic mix that perfectly complements the other flavors.  The jamaica (hibiscus) drink was perhaps the best I've had, though the horchata was a bit mealy.   The sopes were good, if not particularly distinct in flavor from a tortilla."}
{"text":"I went back to El Sabor de Puebla, and felt that they read my review!!  The food AND the PORTIONS were ideal.  This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison now.   I hope I will be able to see consistency."}
{"text":"Spending a decade of my life in Chicago, I have often longed for some of the extraordinary Mexican food I would consume on a regular basis. Don't get me wrong, Madison has recently gotten some pretty legit spots, but I think it's safe to say El Sabor de Puebla has quickly become one of my favorites.   We dined in their new location, conveniently located in walking distance from my house. They've done a nice job with the space, making it casual and cozy.  The food was excellent. I got the Torta Milanesa de Res and my family all got tamales and tacos. The Torta was outstanding, reminiscent of some of my favorite spots in Chicago. Milanesa can often come off being chewy and gristly. Sabor's was tender on the outside, but maintaining the crisp, fried exterior. Topped with pickled jalapenos, avocados, cheese and crema---this Torta was fantastic.   The tacos tasted great too and a they serve a killer horchata. All in all, i'm smitten to have them in the neighborhood and they are guaranteed to become a weekly haunt."}
{"text":"The only thing that would make this place better is a margarita. While they don't have a liquor license, the authentic Mexican food is great. This is a family owned business with a menu that expands beyond your typical burritos and enchiladas. You feel like you are getting a little taste of Mexico when you arrive. Be prepared to take your time and enjoy. It's not quick, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I wish we could use 1/2 star ratings to bump a place up or down.  2 1/2 stars here.  Portion size for price was great.  Beans and rice were not warm though.  Needed to ask for silverware and napkins, after dish was brought to table.  Needed hot sauce for every bite.  That tells you a bit about the lack of seasoning.  The service was good though, and two people stopped back at my table to inquire about my meal.  That is huge in my opinion.  Would not rush back.  Average experience, and not that memorable. Specific to flavor."}
{"text":"My family came to this place after reading about a new Mexican restaurant opening. I like these restaurants that are converted houses. They've also decorated the inside to have a more \"traditional\" Mexican restaurant feel.   The salsa was very watered down and not very good, but the chips were good.  To start, we ordered the chicken and pork sopes as an appetizer. Both were good and filling. Could easily be a meal in itself.   For our dishes, the best was the al pastor taco and the chicken tamales. If you add a radish and rajas to the taco, they're as good as you can find. The tamale was very good too with some salsa splashed on it.  Other than that, we ordered a variety of enchiladas with mole and the green salsa. The mole wasn't my fav but it was ok. The green salsa enchiladas were similarly ok. Can't really object to them but probably wouldn't get them again.  Overall, place is alright. Would go back for the tacos"}
{"text":"The best tacos in town. Their burritos with mole' is very tasty. Their cemitas are huge sandwiches, rich with the flavor of chipotle peppers, white cheese, and meat. A bit out-of-the-way, but worth the search."}
{"text":"Excellent food, cool atmosphere. I love their tamales and tacos. Never had a bad experience"}
{"text":"Service was terrible, he didn't know what a torta was when I asked him, I looked online and it looked like a sandwich so I asked, \"is it a sandwich?\" He didn't know. Then I asked what types of tamales they had, if they were different meat or sauce? He didn't know. Then I just ended up ordering one taco (el pastor-pork taco) 2/5. My fiancé ordered 2 carne asada tacos and a tamale and I'd give it a 1/5. Also had to go inside and look for a drink menu because the sign board read, \"now serving alcohol\" found the cooler and had to ask if I should help myself or what?   Overall: service was really bad & food was bad. Really disappointing because I am obsessed with Mexican food!! Good thing Chocolate Shoppe was down the road"}
{"text":"Great food for a decent price. We had the mole burrito verde enchiladas both were very good. Service was great and we received our food quickly."}
{"text":"This place is so damn good. My theory as to it's current 4/5 stars rating is that people don't want to gush about this place too much for fear that it will get too busy. This place was totally under my radar and I just stumbled on it--how lucky I was.  Food is fresh, high quality, delicious. It's satisfies a craving for Laredo's, but everything is better and homemade. Big portions. Homemade sauces!  I had the cheese enchiladas with green sauce--comes with rice, beans and small side salad. Dining partner had the chile relleno and that was tasty too.   Small patio out front is nice."}
{"text":"This place has very authentic Mexican food. However because of my exposure to Taco Bell and Mexican appearing restaurants it is not up to my taste, or you can say down to my taste. They have great food is just not my type of food."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place! I ordered a combination meal with a pork tamale and a carne asada taco. The meat was delicious and the Pico de gallo and guacamole tasted fresh. The salsa had a decent kick to it as well. Looks like they produce most of their own ingredients too which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Stopped in for margaritas and was surprised to learn they only serve bottled drinks.  They did serve beer and a bottled margarita but it was a little odd finding a Mexican restaurant sans Margaritas, lol.  Since we were already seated we stayed for a drink & chips/salsa.  My friend had the bottled margarita which she said was ok. I ordered a Michelada which was delicious and perfectly done!  Salsa was flavorful but can't say I was a fan of the chips.  Would return to try the food, even without tequila!"}
{"text":"I'm genuinely baffled that this restaurant currently has a 3.5 rating here on Yelp. The food I've had here feels more like what I'd expect from a 4.5.  I've come here on two occasions, and both trips were solid.  The salsa that comes with the free chips is perfect to my tastes: mildly spicy and full of flavor. The chips themselves are also good.  I've had tamales, tacos, and a mole burrito. The tamales were my favorite, with asssertive flavors and perfect texture. The tacos were okay--the shells weren't great. The mole burrito tasted pretty good, although I wish it had a bit more spice to it.  Portions are generous, prices are low. You can easily be full for less than $10. Personally, I had no problems with the service.  I admit that one of my favorite things about this place is the fact that it's a restaurant run out of a house. It turns out that I'm weak for that quaint budget aesthetic."}
{"text":"I like what they are doing, still needs some work around the edges, but it has potential. I especially love the micro-farmers market they do and sell fresh veggies right out front. Service was a bit slow.  Let's start with their salsa - it's very close to pico and just didn't have much flavor, which is odd, because their house-made hot sauce is flavorful and pretty spicy.  The enchiladas were a bust - taste was bland and dry tortillas, just weren't flavorful. The taquitos on the other hand were pretty tasty and included lots of cheese on top. They had lamb barbacoa tacos on special and I thought they were on the right track, but a bit dry and the pieces weren't cut small enough .  I think the mole-covered burrito is probably the way to go. How can you go wrong? The menu has some nooks and crannys and with the specials - there is quite a bit of exploring to do.  They need to get some side money to the city councilmen (or whatever it takes) to get their liquor license - Mexican food without Mexican beer is a tragedy."}
{"text":"Sabor de Puebla is a severely underrated place. I got their burrito with mole and a tcylaco (unsure if spelling is correct. I definitely recommend trying one of their special dishes from Puebla. It was so good we ordered two. Prices are good. Ambiance is so so. Service was good. This is pretty close to authentic. I'll be back and I'll come hungry!"}
{"text":"To be completely honest, I was having a horrid day yesterday, but I do not think that clouded my judgement over this review. Because the food I ate was...bad.  So here's the deal. I like tacos. I like burritos. I'm pretty easy to please. Hell, I'd eat Taco Bell.  The burrito I had last night at El Sabor was honestly the worst burrito I have ever had. Perhaps it is because I am a vegetarian, and maybe the meat dishes are good, but this was inexcusably bad. My burrito was supposed to have rice, beans, cheese, spinach and mushroom, covered in mole. I didn't like the mole. It did not go with the filling at all. It needed something creamy in the burrito like sour cream or avocado to break through the dry ingredients.  And speaking of the filing, if you are going to charge 10.50 for a burrito with minimal ingredients they have to be cooked well. The spinach and mushroom had NO flavor (how is this possible?!) and weren't cooked well.  Service was...awkward to say the least and it was just the cherry on top of a horrible day.  I'll leave you with this quote from my husband as we were entering the restaurant, \"Well at least they can't mess up Mexican food, right?\""}
{"text":"What other place in Madison gives you guacamole and chips gratis? For this and other reasons, El Sabor de Puebla is a bang for your buck. If you're a person who appreciates a good taco or huarache, you will like it. (Same goes for mole.) If you're a person who veers toward less authentic fare and expects a gargantuan margarita, then forget it. It's a no frills place. But what they do, they do well, and the prices can't be beat for this neighborhood. One huarache will feed you. One mole dish will feed you for days. If you live on this side of town and aren't within a stone's throw of Naty's or Taqueria Guadalajara, this is your place."}
{"text":"I dare say, the ONLY authentic Mexican food you can find in Madison, although nothing is very spicy.   Some of these negative reviews are so snooty. Yikes!   I ordered tlacoyos, a specialty street food of Mexico State, which I have only ever had in Mexico. The young server (I'm guessing the owner's daughter) did not really know how to describe what I was ordering since I wanted to be sure I would not be disappointed by something else. However, I received a perfectly authentic tlacoyo (it was missing nopales, which is ok; even some Mexicans can't stomach them). My husband ordered the mole which was burnt and tasted a little too much like chocolate, but that may just be a question of taste."}
{"text":"The mole is a MUST have. It came recommended by our server, who was prompt and thorough. I will be coming here again. The sopes were also very good and fresh."}
{"text":"The food was really good here but the service was awful and it took nearly 1 hour to get a few tacos at 5pm on a Sunday. As a former waitress I'm usually very sympathetic to wait staff but this was really bad. We had to get up and ask for everything every step of the way- menus, to order, our food, silverware, the check.  Hopefully they can figure out the service end of the restaurant business since it is hard to find decent authentic Mexican food in Madison."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food.  Authentic sauces and fresh made food.  Had Sopes Plate with pork cooked in a red sauce.  Nice mix of cheese, pork and veggies. My date had mole enchiladas, which she thought was delicious. Clearly a fresh made sauce.   Service was quick and friendly.  And, like most Mexican food the prices were low.   We also get their tamales at the Co-op.  Good for quick dinners.  I get to New Mexico regularly where they have consistently good food.  This compares well with Mexican type diners there."}
{"text":"Garbage. Save your money and your stomach. Chips from 1985... maybe? Human hair in food. My meat from my dish tasted like it was thawed and refrozen maybe 5 times... ? Like from my old grandmas house when it was left in the garage in the spring where it would thaw in the day and freeze at night. Not going back... ever."}
{"text":"This small Mexican taqueria is a welcome addition Willy St. The service is considerably better than that of Cafe Costa Rica, which occupied the space formerly. The menu is simple and the ingredients are fresh. The enchiladas mole were really great; the freshness of the ingredients really shone in this dish. The tortas are also a good bet. The al pastor torta was delicious and filling. The meat was perfectly seasoned and grilled, and the tomatoes, lettuce, and avocado on the sandwich were very fresh. I believe they get their produce from the Los Abuelos Farley Farm. They have specials listed on the whiteboard in the back, which is hard to see if you are sitting up front. Be sure to ask for some of their aguas frescas!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of mole and after reading the reviews praising their mole I had to check it out.  It's a clean restaurant and a fairly comfortable space; the quick and friendly service bumped my rating to the four stars.  Food wise, it did not live up to the hype.  The complimentary chips and salsa were great (warm chips and salsa with some heat), but the mole needed a bit more kick to it - it was heavy on the chocolate flavor, not on the spice.  They did slather it on my enchiladas and hubby's burrito, so that was a bonus as some places aren't as generous.  Also, there weren't many vegetarian options other than a spinach/mushroom burrito.  I'd be interested in going back and trying their tacos."}
{"text":"Okay so I'm a huge fan of Mexican food. And yes the food had good flavor however the way the restaurant was run is not at all favorable. We walked in at about 8:30 on a steamy Saturday night. There is no air conditioning, no fans and the windows were shut. When we walked in we weren't greeted at all. So we sat wherever we choose once another couple directed us to do so. After waiting about 5 minutes we were brought menus and asked if we would like something to drink.  The chips I think are homemade but must have sit under the lamp too long. But the salsa was good. We finished our waters and finally someone took our order. Now at this time there was only another couple that got there a few minutes before us but we ordered before them and shortly after we ordered another gentleman came in and ordered. Both other tables got their food before us and we waited approx 35 from ordering to service. We were offered more water but it was warm.  The taste of the food wasn't worth the wait."}
{"text":"Not bad pricing and not bad flavors. Got the carne asada quesadilla served with sour cream, guacamole and salsa, and rice and beans. The green sauce really made the dish better. I went with a large group and once we receive the red and green sauce, we all reached for the extra flavor. So slightly on the bland side but the sauce was great."}
{"text":"The Mexican food here is not very authentic. Everything is pretty much covered in cheese, and the mole sauce is strangely sweet and not spicy at all. Service was extremely slow, and I was charged for an extra plate that I didn't order, but they quickly took that off of the bill when I mentioned it. Also, due to the fact that they only have one waitress for the entire place, your water will not be refilled, and you will only get a small basket of chips. The food is overall pretty expensive for the quality, around $11 for a not so good burrito covered in sweet mole sauce and sesame seeds (?). The atmosphere is just ok, colorful, but they need more windows. Overall, I would consider this a rather pricy hole in the wall, and I could have paid the same price for a better meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered tamales for a pot luck at my job. My co-workers LOVED THEM...I also ordered the chicken tacos they were phenomenal. This is my new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"I love the mole burrito. Great service. This is my favorite neighborhood option when I'm hungry for something substantial."}
{"text":"Hands down the freshest, most delicious Mexican food I've had in Wisconsin! The beans! The corn tortillas! Those tamales! Go try it now!"}
{"text":"What a cute little place on Willy! Delicious salsa with a little kick. The tamales were excellent. Everything we had was really good. I had never tried Tecate beer, but I will be doing that again. Yum!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican tacos! I get their Al Pastor tacos almost every time. The flavors are great and the pork is always tender. Their tamales are really good as well. Definitely worth a try.   If you're looking for good authentic Mexican food at a reasonable price, you should give this place a try."}
{"text":"I really appreciate good tacos, and I have not been disappointed here. I've had the chicken and steak multiple times and they've been consistintely good, well seasoned and fresh. The patio is cozy and the people who work there are super nice too!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, authentic, not overly salted/seasoned like many other local Mexican restaurants! Refreshing salsa with the perfect ratio of ingredients. Delicious, fresh chips. Loved the beef, chicken and pork tacos with cilantro and onions - the small size is miniature but great for sampling. Roasted steak and cactus was perfectly prepared. The restaurant still has a few logistical quirks to work out but the food was the best I've had in the Madison area."}
