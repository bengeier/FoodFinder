{"text":"As soon as you walk in you know that you are in a different kind of coffee shop from all of the cookie cutter reclaimed wood edison bulb places. The smell of freshly roasted Ethiopian coffee beans fills the space. Walls are lined with specialty Ethiopian foods like spicy Berbere paste and Teff Injera is made fresh on select days. Delicious! You can have a typical machiatto/latte or go full on for the Coffee Ceremony. Croissants from Fantail bakery on Roncesvalles are also brought in daily. This is a great new spot for the Beaconsfield, Parkdale neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I am torn between appalled and amused. Arranged to meet friends at Buna. We were to meet at 2. I arrived a bit early, and went to the door. Door is locked, lights are on. No note, no sign: the place was to all appearances open, but not. Went to the website for a phone number. No number posted. More research revealed that they are owned by the people who own the restaurant next door. Called it (had to dial 1?). Was told \"Oh, yeah, she must've gone out shopping or something. She'll be back in half an hour. Maybe longer.\"  A business with apparently only one staff member randomly closes to go shopping in the middle of business hours and can't be arsed to put up a sticky note on the door?  We had a lovely time at The Gladstone - good coffee and warm biscuits."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic Ethiopian coffee place I know.  From the moment you walk in, you can smell the frankincense in the air.  The beans are sourced directly by the owner from Ethiopia, and they hand roast the beans on a pan behind the counter.  They have the traditional coffee ceremony, which is done in a pot with the grounds on the bottom.  The coffee is served in a traditional coffee cup which looks rather like a Chinese tea cup.  They of course have all the other usual types of coffee as well.  I talked to the couple who owns this place, and they are both very friendly and welcoming.    They also have coffee roasting classes in case you're curious in how to prepare coffee the original way."}
{"text":"Perhaps a good destination for authentic Ethiopian coffee; however, I can only speak to their lattes, which were kind of disappointing.   The \"barista\" simply steamed some milk and proceeded to dump it on the coffee with lightening speed---right in front of me. I don't consider this a latte, forget the latte art! This was just coffee with hot milk that I could have made at home without the $9 price tag.   I suggest Buna engage the services of an experienced barista if they want to attract Toronto \"urbanites\" who are used to a specific standard when it comes to lattes.   The baked goods were enticing."}
{"text":"I was in the area and really needing a quick caffeine fix.  The cafe is very clean and modern and specializes in Ethiopian coffee and teas.  I had the chai tea latte with almond milk and it was crafted with care. It wasn't too strong or weak.  It definitely tasted better than Starbucks.  So quality of coffee and tea is very good.  Just one issue though - I tried using the bathroom and it appeared there was a bunch of stock and cleaning supplies blocking the way, so that's why they get knocked down a star (I would have given them 4 stars otherwise)."}
{"text":"Like the other reviews, the Coffee Experience is definitely highly recommended! Especially if you are a coffee lover.  You really haven't had good coffee until you try this coffee!  Chris / Nunu are both so wonderful.  Nunu did a really wonderful job of preparing the coffee for us while Chris came back to answer any questions that we had.  We learned so much about coffee that we didn't even know before.    Very much like their sister company on the other side (Nunu's Ethiopian Restaurant), there is much care taken in ensuring the best quality beans are used in the making of their coffee/beans.    They have the original green beans (pre-roasted) that you can purchase to freshly roast at home.    We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"An original coffee experience. This isn't a place to run and grab a coffee to work. It's a place to linger and appreciate coffee in a completely new way.  It's truly fascinating to see her, I believe she might be one of the owners, roast coffee beans in front of you. I had notions from seeing machines that it had to take a long time.  Anyway, the clay pots they brew in go directly on the gas stove. I was always expecting one to explode but nope!   The coffee ceremony was accompanied by the burning of frankincense which I learnt helps to enhance that coffee experience. Who knew????  Customer service was amazing and she loved sharing this.  If you are a coffee aficionado this is a must experience."}
{"text":"FOOD/DRINKS: Just stopped in to have a cup of coffee but ended up getting a mocha. It was good but not the best. Food items were limited and didn't look fresh. I wish the cup I was served in was better than the mug I got. I believe the mugs are for coffees not mochas. Also the employee didn't know how to do a design in the mocha so visually the mocha didn't look great. Wish they had sugar packets instead of the bowl with sugar and spoon.   PRICE: $$$ pricy menu   PLACE: Washroom could be cleaner, but overall looked fancy and nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by to just grab a cup of coffee.  Except my husband ordered an Ethiopian Coffee Ceremony and then we proceeded to hang out and discover what the soul is all about.  I don't know how, but I left that place feeling more soulful.  I just had a basic almond milk latte.  The espresso part of the coffee was good.  Overall execution of latte was alright.  I clearly ordered wrong here though.  The Coffee Ceremony was was more relaxing than I would have imagined for $6.  Starts with some nice smelling frankincense and then a fresh roasted bean and a delicious, creamy espresso.  While the coffee is roasting this relaxing aroma floats through the entire coffee shop.  We got to spend some time with the owner and he certainly is passionate about preserving the history of the coffee.  If you have about 10 minutes, definitely get the ceremony and enjoy an Ethiopian experience from the bean to the Jebina."}
{"text":"A clean modern cafe specializing in Ethiopian coffee and teas.  We came here when our first tea stop was still closed and we enticed by the scent of frankincense burning.  It's a very interesting place as it roasts the green coffee beans right there on the premises and then make the coffee is a special coffee urn called Jebina.    We tried the Ethiopian tea, Chai Tea, and their jebina coffee here and they were all very uniquely flavoured from your typical Starbucks palette.  Bold flavours that hinted more on herbal and floral than sugary sweet.  The manager or owner was very good on educating us on the differences between the Ethiopian coffee flavour and why.  It was very fun to learn something new about our drinks.  The Ethiopian tea was light in colour but sharp it it's bold flavour.  I don't remember all the flavours but peppermint is one of them and I really enjoyed it as it was very warming, no bitterness or grassiness, and it was a very good warming experience.  The Chai latte was very interesting as the first note was an almond like nuttiness that mellowed into light creamy sweetness and lastly a star anise licorice note hits you.   It was a bit on the pricey side for both drinks but I do appreciate the unique flavour that it brought.  We were offered the Jebina coffee just as we were leaving to enjoy the different flavour of the Ethiopian coffee.  Wow, what a difference.  The coffee is a dark roast but instead of having that strong burned scent ... it's floral.  That's right!  It smells a little bit like a flower bed.  The taste of the coffee is smooth and strong with no acidity.  It needs no milk or sugar.  It's quite nice and if I'm looking for a different take on coffee, I know where to look next time!"}
{"text":"What a kick a$$ coffeeshop! I was totally feeling the \"soul of coffee\" here and I threw back one almond milk latte after another, both so strong, I had felt that sweet sizzlin' in my veins!  When I walked by on a recent rainy Friday, I was in search of a non Starbucks coffeeshop that wasn't packed to the gills so that I could set up and work for a couple hours. The Drake was packed. I kept walking. The scent of Frankincense hit me as I approached Buna and I had to peek in (that's my favorite scent): inviting little spot with plenty of place to sit. Sold.  I later came to find out from my friend that Frankincense is part of a sacred coffee ritual in Ethiopian culture. This place is the real deal and the man working the counter who I assumed was an owner told me that their beans are imported from Ethiopia and roasted there (possibly on the premises but don't quote me on that) in Toronto. Hello, freshness. They sell coffee beans, teas and spices, including ready made jars of berbere paste (typically I get a powdered version at WF so I had to buy one).   I very much recommend Buna for a change of pace from your typical hipster coffeeshop. The lattes are velvety and rich. The people are friendly and informative. The space is very conducive to working or catching up with a friend for a coffee date. Love."}
