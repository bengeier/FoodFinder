{"text":"Second location for Mustachio (n√© Uno Mustachio) which previously only had a small outpost in the basement of St. Lawrence Market. This one is in a downtown food court in the Atrium on Bay complex across the street from the Eaton Centre - a food court which has had its share of turnover, but finally seems to be on the upswing.  Pretty much the same great Italian sandwiches as the original, but the menu is slightly different - the \"parmagiana\" varieties are the default here which means a slightly higher starting price point than their original location. That said, I was happy with the veal parmagiana I tried on their second day open. They're also trying a build-your-own-pizza option here, which I have not yet tried - presumably to compete with Blaze down the street."}
{"text":"Friend recommended this place for lunch for me. Amazing chicken and eggplant sandwich. Staff was great. Very clean kitchen."}
{"text":"Hands down best sandwiches in Toronto.  Great portions staff is extremely helpful. Place looks fantastic."}
{"text":"Terribly disappointing. I have tried the veal sandwich twice here and both times the meat was tough, the bun stale and the sauce bland.   I remember the sandwiches at the StLawrence location being much better."}
{"text":"Obviously not as interesting as the St Lawrence Mkt location, I haven't been in this basement/mall in years (old/bad design on main floor, etc; i.e. not much reason to venture into the Atrium).  Prefer this to California Sandwiches, good portions, staff very friendly."}
{"text":"I work for the BMO nearby the atrium and I rarely eat out. I was pleasantly surprised at a new spot that caught my eye, Uno Mustachio, Italian eatery. I've seen them before in St. Lawrence market as well - always crowded lineups for their veal sandwiches...Having tried their sandwich before (which is awesome by the way), I decided on getting pasta instead. I went for the spaghetti with meat sauce and meat balls. The staff cooked the pasta and sauce right in front of me and took just a few minutes. The meat balls were amazing - sauce and texture was on point! Nothing I would have expected from a fast food joint. All in all, I had a great experience at Mustachios. I was in and out in under 20mins. I would highly recommend for those looking for a high quality lunch and on a time crunch. Cheers to another good lunch spot around the office."}
