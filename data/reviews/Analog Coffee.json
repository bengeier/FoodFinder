{"text":"Great coffee joint! They also make really tasty sandwiches and baked goods! A bit on the pricey side. Overall great place to grab a coffee or tea and sit outside and relax!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a balanced, well made cup of coffee, Analog is a sure bet. They also have a number of non-coffee options, such as a rich hot chocolate and a decent selection of tea. Analog's pastries and snacks are also worthwhile.

Indoor seating is a hot commodity and may be a challenge, similar to 17th Ave's parking situation. On sunny days, Analog's outdoor seating is perfect for getting your daily dose of vitamin D and people watching."}
{"text":"The triple shot latte is my go to here! The service is always friendly and the baristas are quick to make your beverage even though the place can be mad-house busy. Side walk seating is available and a great place to people watch along 17th Ave. 

Absolutely my first stop before heading next door to Sloth Records!"}
{"text":"This is the best coffee I've had in this city so far. So flavourful! I have ordered a cappuccino, a mocha, and a latte. They source their beans from various countries and the barista said they even have a roaster here in Calgary.

I'm taking a star off due to them not having honey available for their tea. I understand that honey is a lot more expensive now due to the bees disappearing, but if it's a problem they should at least have packets of honey you can buy. To not have a staple of tea, such as honey, is unforgivable in this day and age!

Have honey available and it gets 5 stars."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite cafe in Calgary. Great selection of coffee, friendly staff, and quick service even in busy hours. Try their pour over using different coffee origins to taste the different notes in their coffee."}
{"text":"I go here almost every work day. Best drip coffee hands down. And the coffee beans to buy are also excellent-expensive but if you keep your eyes peeled they get marked down two for one- worth buying a few bags for home!
I also have tried some baking and a latte or two also the best you will find in one place."}
{"text":"This place has delicious espresso. If you visit this shop try the god father espresso... You will not be disappointed. The lattes are good, but sometimes I feel like I can never finish it because the foam just fills me up! The coffee shop is usually always busy and sometimes it's hard to find a seat if your coming with someone!"}
{"text":"Analog is one of my fav coffee spots in town, packing one of the best cappuccinos around! I enjoy fratello coffee! And the service isn't ever to bad. There's usually a decent line up... And I mean that as a compliment! Whether it's fratello coffee in the Calgary framers markets or analog on 17th.. You're always in store for a good sip."}
{"text":"Coffee is decent, staff are good. Just that the environment sucks. Never a place to sit."}
{"text":"The service here was excellent. The server was nice friendly and on the ball. I had the sea food pasta with no complaints. For the price paid I wasn't blown away with anything though. It wasn't much different from places that are half the price, such as spaghetti factory. So overall service and food quality good, bang for buck not so much."}
{"text":"Thought we'd pop into this place since there was quite a crowd inside and out.  Must be good coffee!  Service was good considering the number of people waiting.  The coffee was unfortunately poor according to our tastes as people who drink black or with a touch of heavy cream.  The beans in the grinder are light and dry as opposed to rich, dark and oily.  Never mind that...the saddest thing of all is that when we asked for unwhipped cream for our long shot americano, we were told they had 'no whip cream'.  I felt that I had been misunderstood so I asked if they served espresso 'con panna' (topped with whipped cream).  Again..'no'.  We began to leave and we thought we would ask the nice young man who had helped us first.  He said they had none so I asked what was the heaviest milk they had and....(drum roll please) he told me it was....3%!!!  3% folks in a place that claims to be a cafe or coffee house is quite simply unacceptable.  Perhaps he meant, 'today'.    (We have owned and operated our own successful coffee house in another country)."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee joint.

Excellent coffee paired with excellent service. The workers are always happy and always making friendly conversation. I agree with everyone else who says that this joint has the best coffee in the city, which is obviously why it is always so packed!"}
{"text":"Any visit to Calgary MUST include a stop at this amazing coffee shop. Take time to sit and enjoy the atmosphere in this lovely, sunny, comfortable location. The latte's are consistently amazing and the treats are truly top notch. Also, the staff is ALWAYS kind and friendly, something unusual for Calgary coffee shops.

I would highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out! Great atmosphere tea and service. I would recommend this place to all my friends!"}
{"text":"The coffee here? It's like unicorns dancing on your tongue. I would marry this coffee, have a messy divorce, pay it alimony, and then marry it again. They also have the most lovely baristas who always appear to be laughing and smiling at work which is awesome! Definitely makes having to go to the mall a better time. If there were 6 stars? You'd get them."}
{"text":"Great coffee, I've noticed it being served in some on Calgary's restaurants which is nice. Always so busy I can never find a spot to sit.. Always get my coffee to go. Oh well. You can still get some Corbeaux baked goods if you come early enough, they tend to sell out in the evenings. Cute place!"}
{"text":"I always love coming here on a Saturday morning. The atmosphere is vibrant and the people watching is great. You can't go wrong with fratello coffee either! Try a sandwich-they get them from local joints all around the city and it changes all the time."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to 17th ave! Me and my boyfriend were on a walk last week and stopped in for quick coffee - from our short 10 minutes in the shop, it was great! We LOVE the interior décor! and delicious Lattes! I recommend!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Coffee was a little weak and the place is a little pricey but that seems to keep out the screaming baby trailer park and immigrant crowd. Volume is tolerable and you can get decent work done here. Parking is a bear except on Sundays. Parking is the only major negative. Staff is relatively friendly but the place was so crowded, people were doing the breast stroke"}
{"text":"I really love this coffee shop! The atmosphere is always so friendly and lively. You can go here to grab a drink with friends/family and end up staying for hours. 

The quality of drinks is delightful, you can tell that for the price you are paying, you're definitely getting something worthwhile. This is my go-to cafe at anytime. Staff are friendly and efficient too!"}
{"text":"Great coffee. Great service. Great space. Love a coffee shop with efficient service and flow. One of my favourite coffee shops."}
{"text":"Opening day and staff are looking bright and shiny. My extra shot latte and kouign aman (Corbeaux Bake house) pastry were perfect.
I'm so happy to have this location nearby in Southcentre Mall...and look forward to many visits to come!"}
{"text":"Note: I stopped in on this particular visit because I had a complimentary coffee ticket.

I like their coffee. They are friendly. It is nice to be able to have an Analog Cafe at SouthCentre-just wish their shop was more intimate and isolated from the mall. It would be great to have a small cafe in a separate space (versus tables in the middle of the mall walkway.

They sell the pour over beaker and aeropress (in case you are interested)"}
{"text":"Finally was able to try this one Tuesday night. The coffee is great and the mochas are amazing. I love the decor and the vibe of this place - I'll be coming back here to study for school in the future. There was also a nice selection of baking which I will definitely be trying one day. Analog also offers great people watching."}
{"text":"Love this place, great coffee and little bites. They have just opened in Southcentre Mall."}
{"text":"I ordered a hot chocolate and I can definitely say it was one of the worst chocolate drinks I've ever had, and not to mention it was also overly-priced.

My friend and I were by the condiments area, when all of the sudden the manager -- at least I assume, cause she wasn't doing anything -- came by to basically gawk at us to make sure we weren't going to steal any of their over-priced sweeteners. I'm Asian and the friend I was with is African, which apparently means we must've degenerates. 


Final thoughts:

- Not worth it, unless your white."}
{"text":"Consistently Killing it !! The extra shot in my latte makes a golden brown residue that clings to the walls of my cup all the way to the bottom until the very last sip. Bunch of professionals pulling shots here. I watch people go to $tarbuck$ across the street and often wonder what the hell they are thinking ?!??! They are steps away from delicious goodness and choose middle of the road........turn around and go to analog people !! They also carry Sidewalk Citizen baked goods and thats the Icing on the cake."}
{"text":"Fabulous coffee, great place to sit outside and people watch on 17th. The only downside is there aren't very many electrical outlets. If you're planning to stay and do some work you may be out of luck for a spot with a plug-in."}
{"text":"During the 3 days I recently spent in Calgary, I probably spent a total of a full day here. I finished reading 1.5 books in this cafe. I adore this place.
Not only is the space a really comfortable atmosphere, but the baristas are passionate about their work and that shines through in tasting the coffee. Fratello makes amazing coffee, and it's great to support local Albertan roasters! The pastries are delicious as well. After all of the coffee-shop-hopping I did in Calgary, this place is one of my absolute favourites."}
{"text":"Went in and boy was there a line - here's the thing - went super fast and the service was friendly and attentive. Don't even get me started on their amaaaaazing ham and cheese croissant sandwiches. 
In sum: cool and welcoming atmosphere, solid coffee, and fresh delish baked goods. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"I am disgusted with this place and their staffs attitudes like seriously who do they think they are,yes their coffee is good but so is a lot of places and at least they cover their pastries.I ordered a coffee in this place just the other day as I had been before just for a coffee to go and decided I would have a pastry until I noticed they had flies all over them I counted 3 at least just sitting on the pastries and when I told the girl serving her response was \"flies don't actually kill you\" what????OK genius maybe not but they do carry a lot of bacteria so before they were on your pastries they were probably sitting on shit so you eat it.I understand it's hard to keep flies away from food but if you realise it  then cover them or get a better storage system and don't just treat people like idiots.I have been to some of the best coffee places all over Europe and we know good coffee shops and if that's what this place thinks they are they are way off."}
{"text":"I'm  normally a coffee drinker but I went in here with a tea drinking friend and thought, why not. It was busy for later in the evening and the staff weren't overly friendly. Maybe they were tired. It was clear I had never been there before and they did nothing to explain their options -  whether it be tea or coffee.

I ended up with a version of green tea. While its nice they take the time to make it their special way, again having something or someone explain that would be helpful. Tell your story people! And the product I got, while tasty, didn't seem overly special to me.

Maybe this is what I get for drinking tea and had I stuck to my coffee roots I'd be more razzle dazzled. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Just went to get a drink here this afternoon (Saturday) with my girlfriends. I've come here a lot before today and the coffee is always great. They have a good selection of tea. The Indian chai I had today was tasty. The baristas are friendly and I have to mention the beautiful presentation of the coffee with all the nice designs. The only downfall is it's always a struggle to find somewhere to sit but I suppose it's because the coffee is that good!"}
{"text":"Heard about Analog from friends raving about this place. So had to try it out for myself. Glad I did as the coffee is amazing! Great location and a real good crowd. The baristas really know their stuff. I'll be coming back often."}
{"text":"I love their coffee! Whenever friends come to visit me this is the first place I take them for their morning caffeine fix. The only downside  is there isn't much seating inside. This is never an issue for me, but if you're looking for a place with guaranteed seating this may not be your best bet (unless you're okay with waiting a bit for a table to become available)."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to get off our suburban butts and headed to the core to try something new. It was my first time here so I cannot really give a full review. 

I got an iced Chai tea while she got an iced latte. I'll be honest that this is the first time I've ever tried an iced chai tea. It was not bad but it did taste a little too sweet for me. It also had a weird after taste, it's definitely possible that it requires an acquired taste. The iced latte is pretty good with its fragrant aroma and a smooth as well as a balanced flavour. 

The service is excellent, but the fact that the place was busy, we weren't able to stay in the café for long and enjoy the interior design. We sat out on the chairs provided outside. They were a bit flimsy but they did the trick. The place is clean and bright. 

Their drinks a on the pricey side. But overall, the establishment is good enough that we will for sure visit again."}
{"text":"Not a bad little place to meet a couple friends!  Good choice of coffee/tea and they offered some delicious snacks to munch on."}
{"text":"This is just like any other trendy coffee joint; but the sidewalk outside, that's the people-watching place you want to be on a sunny day.

A latte done well is a latte done well so the real appeal of Analog is sitting out on the sidewalk in a little iron chair with a drink and watching the weird and wonderful world that is 17th Ave SW go by.

T."}
{"text":"Holy &@$#....!!!! I just had the smoothest Mocha in my life at Analog! Perfect temperature too! For just under $5 for a 12oz it really was the least they could do. 

It's a very trendy atmosphere inside. Bob Dylan is playing in the back ground surprisingly loud while the 17 avenites talk about life, love and liberty. 

Two long benches straddle the entrance face large windows offering couplets and singles plenty of sunlight. 6 seats per bench. There are approximately 5 small tables inside which probably means you are getting yours to go because its mad packed. 

The line up was very analog, as in slow. So whip out your Yelp app and start posting pictures or start your review.

Thanks Analog for a great mocha-gasm!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, open late and a cappuccino that hits the spot.  The place is your typical 20 something hangout complete with Apple computers and youths drowning out the atmosphere with headphones.

I only hope this type of coffee shop comes into Edmonton.  Higher end without pretentiousness."}
{"text":"Quite good coffee, this is an accomplishment for Calgary which generally is a coffee black hole. I'm a coffee snob for sure. I was impressed with the flavor and craftsmanship. Would come back here the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Snacks and coffee were very delicious but where this place excels is there customer service and amazing employees."}
{"text":"Cortado Review

The Pour:
Good. Calgary has a vibrant third wave coffee scene, however IMO the natives haven't fully made the transition from Tim Hortons/Starbucks so in general the the roast profile for the city is extremely dark for craft coffee. Just as San Francisco cafes cater to the local preference for super light roast, Calgary shops have to go to the dark side a bit.

Service:
Baristas are all skilled at pulling the shot and the latte art - quite friendly too.

Ambiance:
This location was downtown in the kind of food court area that many of the buildings have, so it wasn't a standalone cafe, so I'll forgo any discussion of that. It was nice and clean.

Conclusion:
Good but not great for someone used to medium roast. I have the feeling that they'd like to roast lighter, but will take some time for the natives to get used to that.

About Me / Review Criteria:
-I only check out / review \"Third Wave\"/artisanal/craft coffee shops
-Nobody gets more than 4 stars until I've gone several times
-Reviews can't be based on just a select group of baristas, they all have to be equally skilled, or at least must all have a minimum level of skill
-My star ratings are solely based on the drink, never on food, ambiance, or if the barista is emo or snobby (because that would bring down more than 50% of the shops), although I do mention those in the review
-I don't claim to be a trained coffee connoisseur
-My reviews are generally based on gibraltar/cortados (or cappuccinos), not espresso or drip/pourover coffee"}
{"text":"They serve fresh, flavourful coffee, and have a good selection of beans for sale. In fact, I'm drinking their godfather blend as I write this review.

The place is filled up during peak hours; it's a good spot to grab a quick coffee and snack. I wouldn't recommend it for a date or meeting because it can be hard to find seating indoors during the winter."}
{"text":"I finally got to try the Calgary coffeeshop everyone raves about when I met my business partner here early Saturday morning for a weekend work meeting. We had delicious lattes on their tiny patio chairs and it felt exactly as a coffeeshop should. This place is BUSY so best to grab your goods to go unless you're early like we were. I've tried to visit Analog before as a study spot to catch up on MBA homework, but it's tiny with limited seating -- and no one willing to give up their chair -- so I've frequently passed it over. While the coffee and bakery goods are delish, if you're looking for the same with less mayhem, maybe stop by one of the many P&S locations, including one just off 17th ave down 4th street. Staff is friendly and this spot delivers exactly as it should, I just wish it was bigger!"}
{"text":"Good little coffee shop near downtown Calgary. They have a nice selection of beans (I had an espresso from Guatemalan beans, which are my favorite), good seating, and free wifi. The bathroom is also very clean."}
{"text":"Sometimes a bit crowded, but obviously that's because it's one of those homey coffee shops. The coffee is good, and although it can get loud for studying, a good place to spend some time."}
{"text":"A bit too pretentious and hipster centric for me.  Coffee is too pricy despite being on high end 17th Avenue. I doubt I'd go back unless I was meeting clients there, and they were paying."}
{"text":"Yay!!!  Finally... Good coffee at South Centre. I don't know if the Starbucks location is still there, but Starbucks can bite me.. I have been off dairy these days. I dislike my coffee with sweetener and choose organic food whenever possible. I have been traumatized by they very sweet non-dairy options at other coffee places - yuck. I hesitantly asked the cashier about their non-dairy options and she reassuringly gave the right answer - \"Organic, soy, unsweetened.\" I ordered a small and no fooling... (Dairy or not) this was one of the best tasting lattes I have ever had!  This is in a mall but they do have some handy tables nearby.   Rock on Analog Coffee!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a coffee and pastry.  Very laid back and the staff was very professional and friendly. Will be back on our next Calgary trip."}
{"text":"WOW! I love this coffee shop. It's a new fave, f'sho! . 

I have walked by it five hundred thousand times and never gone in. Why? Well, I'm not sure. But now I know what I was missing....and I'm ever so glad I decided to finally check it out. 

I'll tell you why I love it:

1) Cool and interesting people work here. And their sunny dispositions permeates the entire space - helping create a sunny vibe for all to experience. 
2) The caramel steamed milk is BOMB. And I'd imagine the other beverages are equally as delicious (can't wait to find out).
3) Lots of natural light insight, and there are little tables outside where you can sit and people watch. 

The prices are what you'd expect for a trendy coffee shop on 17th, and the lay out of the place is pretty basic (but with a fashionably elegant design)."}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to Analog back in the fall of 2015. I have been back over and over. I love that it's always full lots of options. the drink selection kinda fall short I must say. I love their lattes and the fact that they leave the syrups available in the condiments area. Really wish they had more seating but nevertheless I love this place."}
{"text":"This place was decorated beautifully. I went in when it was kind of busy but got my coffee pretty quickly regardless. 

I ordered a regular drip coffee. Tasted average. Prices are a little more than other places but it's in a nice area so I suppose that's to be expected. With the price however, I expect a little more. There were various options in the  fixins area (sugar, sugar syrups, milk and cream), but it would be nice if they offered agave as an alternative to sugar. Or real honey (and not honey flavoured syrup) for people having tea."}
{"text":"Analog is a nice cafe, although usually pretty crowded. I got a latte, and it was alright. It's not anything special, and its kind of expensive. However, the staff was incredible, and very friendly. Will be coming back, the location and ambiance is really great."}
{"text":"Great cafe!
My sisters were already here studying so I decided to stop by and grab a coffee with them. I have to say I was impressed by the constant stream of customers! I assume its always busy here considering it's a trendy nice cafe on 17th with yummy coffee and pastries. 

I enjoyed my latte. I didn't think it was mind blowing, maybe the flavour was a little too subtle for me, but I definitely enjoyed it nonetheless. I also got a chocolate croissant, something I can't resist trying at new cafes. Delicious! 

I really liked the atmosphere of this cafe. It was pretty busy but my sisters were able to find a table to share and when I got there, there was an extra seat next to them available for me. It's not a cluttered cafe but be ready to get cozy as it gets packed. 
This would be a great cafe to study or do some work. I feel like it would also be a great place to work. Cafe life. 

Thanks again!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Analog. I only came here because I saw the great reviews on Yelp, and now I understand why everyone loves this place.

The full-leaf tea selection here was really impressive. I chose the Cream of Assam today and was very happy with my choice. While sitting at the window bar-top, I was able to get a substantial amount of work done while watching the world go by. I suppose the only reason for not coming here is that I live in the NW, plus parking can be a bit of a challenge around 17th ave. Nevertheless, I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I only had a few hours in Calgary but I made sure to stop by since Fratello coffee was highly recommended by a friend. There was no line when I entered, but also no available seats as they were mainly taken up by people working on their laptops. 

We ordered a latte as well as an iced mocha to go. The latte was pretty good, but what got me was the iced mocha. Absolutely delicious - it was incredibly smooth with a slight sweetness to it. I almost wanted another one immediately! Both drinks were roughly $4.50 each. It's a little on the pricey side for the size of drink. Their card machine also asked for a tip, but I found their attitude to be subpar that day. 

As we left, we noticed a line all the way to the door; in fact, we had to squeeze ourselves between the line and the door to get out. The coffee here is great, decor is wonderful, but it's too busy."}
{"text":"My husband and I nearly gave up on Alberta coffee after visiting several different coffee shops in Calgary and Banff and finding very few that were worth the price. 

Thankfully we stumbled upon Analog on our last day (literally on the way to the airport!) and our cravings for great coffee were finally fulfilled. 

We agreed that Analog served the best Cold Brew but not the most friendly service. I suppose it comes with the territory, but I'll never understand why...

We also ordered two breakfast items (Bacon Breakfast Sandwich, Ham & Cheese Croissant) made by Corbeaux Bakery and devoured them happily. All around deliciousness!"}
{"text":"I think the coffee here is decent, but nothing to scream home about. I like the environment - I only wish it was possible to find a seat. When it's busy (which is often) the place feels a little too cramped. I've probably been here about 15 times, and was able to find a seat right away maybe 3 of those times. 

At the time of this posting, I prefer both Kawa and Philosafy and both are a short walk from Analog"}
{"text":"Great coffee, nice space (although small and always cramped on a weekend) but I have to admit the sandwich I had was not good... the bread was hard/stale and the toppings (sauteed onions, brie, apple) were huge chunks/blobs, so I'd only get a bite of brie (with thick skin), then a bite of onion, then a bite of stale bread, etc. And it was cold - there's no option to grill it... sad."}
{"text":"I like my coffee, and was told by more than one person that this was some of the best coffee in Calgary! When someone makes that claim, you gotta try it for yourself!

Line up was quite long and the store was filled to brim, but the staff worked very diligently and got orders out quite quickly. Decided to go for an Iced Latte, which was quite good!

My favourite thing would probably be the decor, as it was the epitome if modern chic coffee shop! Beautifully simple, but captured the essence of the corner coffee shop! Definitely worth visiting for the coffee addict-lover!"}
{"text":"Coffee that tastes like a bowl full of ripe berries? 

You can find it here.

Espresso that's well balanced with just the RIGHT amount of brightness?

They've got that too.

Scales, V60's, Aeropresses, and coffee talk in the air?

As there should be!

Steady flow of customers (not quite smiling yet because they haven't had coffee) coming through the door, and possibly a line?

Yep. Be prepared. It moves fast though. 

Man buns, big beards, tattoos, tooks, fresh cuts and flatbills? 

In abundance.

Finally, I'm home (away from home). 

While the other two cities in Western Canada I visited have not yet embraced the third wave specialty coffee movement, it's nice to see it has been embraced in Calgary."}
{"text":"November Challenge - 22/30

Well, I can't resist a GOOD cup of coffee. Especially Fratello, so while walking down 17 Ave and seeing Analog on the trail; I followed the caffeine siren call. 

The coffee prep area takes up a good portion of the space, so seating is limited, and the lineup made things feel extra squashy, but the cheerful staff and the wonderful aroma of coffee brewing (really, is there anything better than that smell? I should start rubbing coffee beans behind my ears and on my wrists) makes it all worthwhile. I also love that while they do offer frou-frou lattés, the star of the show is always a simple cup of their finest drip. Which is great, for someone that likes to appreciate a strong cup of black coffee often.

Minus one star only because I feel like the placement of the milk and sugar bar is a recipe for hand burns, spilled coffee and sadness. I understand space is cramped, but it really should be closer to where you receive your drink. I managed just fine with my one coffee, but I can imagine this being troublesome to navigate when you're doing a coffee run for homies and coworkers, and trying to get past a flock doing the same."}

My friend, Steven N., calls it hipster (and I guess it is though my version of hipster is likened to the J.J. Bean chain in Vancouver which he probably knows about since he is from Vancouver). Even with all its alleged hipsterness, it's still an old school coffee shop to me. It's the decor that reminds me of a couple of places I went to in Amsterdam and Brussels. See Rebecca C.'s and Ryan H.'s reviews for great shots of the interior.

I cannot think of why I have not reviewed it before now; I am there enough. It is like my 2nd home (tied with Kensington's Higher Ground despite the fact this was the first coffee shop I visited when I moved to Calgary in 2012). I remember discovering Analog Coffee accidently in 2012 February during a (sunny) heatwave (it was in the -20's °C) as I walking from London Drugs on 8th along the 17th Ave SW side of Tomkins Park (which at the time, I did not know its name). I assumed it was a record store (you know, that place where that those round black circles are sold). So, you can imagine my surprise when I find it's a coffee shop with fresh baked goods.

I remember my first mocha there; large, warm, and chocolaty; just like the my last mocha there (two days ago) (and the God knows how many in between). My 2nd drink of choice is usually hot tea. They have a nice selection of sandwiches and such but my weakness (and staple) is the cookies, especially the peanut butter cookies since I am like the only one it seems not allergic to nuts (that is why I usually get two). Apparently, the Sidewalk Citizen Bakery had supplied Analog with its bakery goods (I found this out because another friend, Wanda B., had left that info in a tip (now, I have to go that soon)). I think now the goods from Corbeaux. You can also get a glass of water if your tea or coffee is too hot (that's located in the back of the shop).

It's a small corner shop that, weather permitting, does have some tables and chairs outside (people watching). 

The shop, facing south towards Tomkins Park [(between 17th Ave SW (east), 16 1/2 Ave SW (west), 8th St SW (south), 7th St SW (north)] and the Public Toilet (on 7th St SW) and east across the street towards BMO and Shoppers Drug Mart, 
attracts all kinds of patrons from all walks of life and apparently, all over the world. It is not uncommon to French, German, and Russian conversations and throw in some Chinese.

While you are there, try to get a window seat on the Tomkins Park side (7th St SW) (because like the Tomkins Park, this is a great area for (more) people watching). If the coffe shop is too busy, you can try the Corbeaux Bakehouse which is a couple of doors down (also owned by Analog Coffee) which has an outdoor patio, weather permitting, as well as windows seats (even more people watching). On any given evening, it is pretty crowded as many of us bring our computers and tablets and work, so electrical outlets can be at a premium. There is free wi-fi as many other reviewers and tippers have pointed out. The music varies from late 60's and well, apparently, anything. It's never a dull moment and in the summer, they are open an extra hour to midnight. As Wanda B. also mentioned, there is another one at Calgary Farmer's Market (the one off of Blackfoot near 77th, not far from IKEA and Costco in the south).

The staff are always nice, friendly, with a sense of humour, and if you are recognized as a regular, they often tell you of new drinks or food they think you might fancy. Add to that, even Car2Go gives you a 10% discount Monday to Thursday (as long as you show your membership card); how cool is that?! I have been begging Analog to put one in Deerfoot Mall (or Deerfoot City as it wants to be known now; it would go great with the Cabela's, if they ever finish that).

Parking in the area is free after 6pm and from 6pm Friday to 8am Monday as well as holidays but that being said, that part of 17th Ave SW is always busy! You can park on the side streets or a couple of blocks away. Best bet would be take a taxi or take a walk down 17th Ave SW!"}
{"text":"What a letdown. Coffee is so-so and they don't serve food. Sorry guys but with five coffee shops within a block you're going to have to do much better than this."}
{"text":"A friend recommended Analog as the perfect place for a good cup of coffee and free WiFi to get some work done while visiting Calgary. I was really thrilled with everything - the vibe, the choice of music, the staff, the ample seating, and of course, the amazing coffee. 

These guys are clearly really obsessed with what they do, so it's easy to appreciate the high standards they present. I spent a couple hours sitting at the bar, close to the cash, so I got a good sense of how they treat their customers - whether you are a regular or a new face, everyone is so pleased to help you out. If I moved to Calgary, I'd want to be a regular here."}
{"text":"Analog, I serious love you. Now if you weren't stupidly busy every single time I walk in the door; I would love you even more."}
{"text":"We came because the coffee shop was listed as one of the \"25 Coffee Shops Around The World You Have To See Before You Die\" in http://www.buzzfeed.com/yezminvillarreal/coffeeshops-you-need-to-see-before-you-die#.jtRMWYeJ2

The location - at the corner of a crossroad - was awesome for some chilling in the afternoon. The atmosphere inside the coffee shop was so relaxing. People was working with smiles on their faces.

My friend and I took a long time choosing which hand brew coffee we would like, which is a must try. We did not get a chance to talk to the staff but just by looking at their brewing behind the bar was already a pleasure."}
{"text":"I didn't get to try any of their espresso based drinks because their coffee machine, of all days, was under maintenance between 10-2pm and we got there at 10:17am. Oops.

I love the coffee shop though, and their pastries are kick ass! I definitely recommend any pastry here, even the saltier ones as to my surprise they were just delicious and well made. I love their attention to detail and great care for their craft when it comes to coffee, and as a result my pour over was INCREDIBLE.

Lots of tables & chairs, as well as bar areas to hang out at. Definitely dig this coffee spot and great third wave coffee shop!"}
{"text":"a girlfriend and I came to this coffee joint on a saturday, very busy of course. Ordered the iced london fog and it was AMAZING, not heavy or too sweet love it. The staff that greeted us and served our drinks were super friendly. A bit pricey though for a small iced london fog.. again mostly ice. but at this point its business and how most coffee places serve iced drinks. overall pretty good. Not enough places to sit tho.. so we ordered to go. Def would come back."}
{"text":"Analog has great coffee--this is something we all know as this shop gains popularity here on Yelp. Some of their options can be a little intimidating, and the line moves quick. So you may be tempted to order an old standby (the panic Americano, for example). But I do encourage you to ask questions. Analog's staff is probably one of their highlights. Friendly, courteous, informative, and also very efficient--something you'll appreciate when you need that early AM coffee.

Ultimately I'd say it's slightly on the expensive side when compared to its notable competitors such as Bumpy's, Artigiano, and Beano. However, they make up for it with attentive staff and great coffee selection. If you're still chasing that ultimate espresso, I do suggest Bumpy's. But if what you're after is expanding your palate with a mind-boggling variety of Fratello coffee, this is the place to go. Plan for about $15 for a drink and snack."}
{"text":"Amazing place, amazing café, great hangout place. Just loved it. You can enjoy a very romantic rainy day, snowed morning or sunny afternoon here and feel like you're living in a beautiful friendly magical world. Staff are very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Analog.... Best. Espresso. In Calgary.  No competition. The \"Godfather\" espresso ... Hits.  The.  Spot.  It hits all the spots.  Even the secret spots.  Analog's hipster elite staff run the show like groovy/happy caffeine commandos!! ... They deserve ALL THE PRIZES!!  Bonus: Red Velvet Cupcakes. That's MY prize.  White chocolate cookies and blue macaroons from outer space!  A showcase showdown in my tum!"}
{"text":"I have a confession. I am far from being a coffee connoisseur. Either a cup of coffee is amazing enough I don't have to lace it with sugar, magic, and cream or it's office GROG that I have to chug down.

And like all of the reviews, Analog's coffee doesn't disappoint. In fact, it's dangerously good. Even despite the price, one can get carried away with a 2-3 cups a visit. Not a good idea when you need your beauty sleep.

But one thing I am a pro at is atmosphere and I can sit at Analogs for hours. One of my friends agreed with me that this was the place to write, at least on 17th. I agree. And with places like Steeps, Beano, Kawa, and Purple Perk nearby, I'd rather park my books and laptop by Analog's window with a plate of their delicious pastries and/or sandwiches. Be forewarned, if you dig into their chocolate croissant you might just spend half an hour licking your fingers to pick up crumbs on yourself so you can relive the glory.

Minus 1 star? Not a big fan of their way of serving tea. They'll properly steep you a great cup, but I'm old fashioned and prefer to cradle a teapot beside my cup."}
{"text":"If I had any weight in telling you where to consume your caffeine, I would tell you that Analog is  THE coffee shop along 17th Ave in Calgary. Here's why as concise as I can:

It's not a place to get your work done. 
It is a place to meet up with friends as long as you're looking for a social environment. 
It is not a place to go for job interview, or to interview someone for a job.
It is a great spot for incredible coffee.
It's a good place for pour over.
The espresso is damn fine.
It's social.
It's too social for intimate interactions.
It's fun.
It's got a vintage, damn well 'analog' feel.
Get your coffee here.
Hang out, have fun, but dont' spend the day."}
{"text":"Came from Toronto and was recommended this place by multiple locals. I absolutely have to agree. This had the best coffee I've had in a long time. I ordered the flat white, nicely done by the barista. The almond croissant had this almond paste that was went well with my coffee. 
My only comment would be that I had paid using an AMEX card during at least 2 visits, and when I returned a 3rd time, I was told by another barista that they don't take AMEX. Not being able to take it and refusing to take it is a different thing. I understand merchant fees cost, but at the same time, to say \"you don't receive AMEX\", when I've been using it multiple times with other baristas was a turn off. Don't get me wrong, multiple places won't take the card, but the conversation that took place was not ideal."}
{"text":"After a week of eating the WORST hotel breakfast (hey, it was fast and free), I HAD to find a place to get a great coffee before jetting out on my last day in town.  I looked at reviews and decided upon Analog.  I got there early, and there was an extremely friendly young woman at the counter, with a French accent.  

I ordered a latte, and she asked if I wanted an extra shot of espresso in that (that's how she prefers it), so I said yes.  I also purchased a ham and gruyere (my favorite cheese) croissant for lunch, which she warmed up in a mini oven that was behind the counter (NOT a microwave - TAKE NOTE other places that think it's OK to microwave any kind of food!).  I also got a chocolate croissant/pain au chocolat for later.

The coffee.. oh, the coffee!  It was so good.  From this point on, I will always get an extra shot in my lattes.  THIS is how I like them - rich, deeply flavorful, not too swee or too bitter, just delectable.  

The croissant is everything that I expect a croissant to be, yet is so hard to find in the U.S.  It was large, buttery, crisp on the outiside, while flakey in the middle.  The gruyere melted nicely over the thinly sliced ham... I was in heaven.

The pain au chocolat made it home with me, and I warmed it in the oven and split it with my husband.  Again - buttery and flakey, with a healthy dose of chocolate in the middle.  Again - perfection.  I went to 5 highly-rated, so-called French bakeries in Houston in search of a great chocolate croissant, and all failed miserably.  They didn't come close to what is offered here.

Oh, Analog, why didn't I find you sooner?  Next time I'll skip the free breakfast.  This place is worth a little less sleep."}
{"text":"Solid bakery and coffee shop in a hip part of town. Clean and charming with a hip alt soundtrack to boot. The almond croissant was a bit dense but good and their coffee cake was insane. Great coffee, and they open earlier than most other places on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Visiting from Seattle and find myself coming back to this place everyday. They have great pastries, sandwiches and excellent coffee. The atmosphere is awesome, the staff is friendly, and they are throwing down some sick tunes all day. You're sure to love this place. They do everything right. :)"}
{"text":"What a place; from the spinning records, to the amazing location, Analog is a cafe I see myself frequenting. The selection is your essential coffee drink varieties, but their baked goodies and sammies looked pretty scrumptious. There were some lone hottie patrons on their laptops, old friends catching up, and trendy couples, mostly, who occupied the space.The whole vibe was very relaxed, although well-kept. Analog is proof that simplicity and quality is key :)"}
{"text":"Had my favourite: standard drip coffee. Was very good, slightly acidic. 

My friend had a latte and was very happy with it. Compared it to Pilot in Toronto."}
{"text":"Stopped by the coffee shop twice while in Calgary. Wonderful coffee and sandwiches. The brownies are a must. I will be back in my next visit."}
{"text":"coffee is probobly the best (next to timmys) in town. The patterns in the mocha's are great!  The only problem is the sandwitches are all pre-made early in the morning.  So im still putting Vendome a star above this as they do make the sandwitches hot to order."}
{"text":"Hipster place to sip your coffee and people watch. I think the coffees are great, but I don't know about being one of the World's best coffee place.. I'm not super picky about my coffee though, all I care is that my americanos are served hot and don't leave an icky, acidic after taste in my mouth after a sip.

I took off a star because this place is always really busy and it's next to impossible to find a seat. I like to be able to sit at a cafe and sip my coffee without having to fight people for a seat."}
{"text":"In our two day trip to Calgary we hit up Analog twice for our coffee fix. We enjoyed the slow drip coffee and it was perfect! We also had the dirty chai latte - one of the girls loves chai and she said it was the best chai she has ever had. I personally don't normally like chai but the second time back I ordered this as my drink because it really was delicious! The espresso based drinks are good too! The staff clearly love what they do, they are friendly and knowledgeable. The place was busy but the service was fast and it has a simple and trendy atmosphere. Totally recommend this coffee shop!"}
{"text":"They serve Fratello Coffee here. Excellent espresso, decent lattes, and one of the best mochas I've had in Calgary. Whenever I am in the area. I find it hard to not stop by for a decent cup of coffee."}
{"text":"We just got americanos and they were good. I liked Monogram Coffee and Rosso more as far as coffee in Calgary, but this is a fun place in downtown to go for coffee and a sweet treat."}
{"text":"Great space, perfectly edited.  Delicious coffee and a nice selection of pastries and breakfast sandwiches.

Staff are efficient and polite with a touch of hipster.

Would I return? Yup. Coffee is great.
Would I recommend?  Yes."}
{"text":"Coffee was pretty strong.   The selection of pastries looked good, but overpriced.  There was good atmosphere and it as cool place to sit and just people watch.  I sat outside drinking my coffee w/my e-reader.  Wi-fi was a bit spotty at times, but it generally worked.  Overall, nice place with rather average coffee."}
{"text":"Second time here and its confirmed, I love it.  Service this morning was fantastic.  Granted you order at the counter but the fellow who took my order and manned the til was awake, smiling and and made very a very pleasant transaction.  This is not always the case at coffee bars and is often commented on (at other establishments of course)  No superior barrista attitude here, just a group of folks who look like they enjoy what they do and working with each other.  It was also nice to see a fair number of regulars that have a rapport with the staff.  Especially noting that it appears to be the last day for someone who is departing for a European adventure.  The coffee was delicious, Ameriano Misto with a pretty design that I unfortunately smudged before taking my photo.  Oh well the photograh cannot relay the taste.   Hot, strong and just the right amount of steamed milk.  The Chocolate Croissant, well actually a Pain Au Chocolate was perfect.  Dark chocolate that has the right amount of bite and sweet and a lovely light flakey pastery.  All in all I felt very French with my petite dejeuner this morning as I dawdled over my pastery and coffee.  Watching the other customers and getting a giggle over the variety of morning moods.  The spectrum runs from \"don't talk to me before I have my morning coffee\" and \"I am a morning person and really happy to be here\".  Look forward to the occassional morning relaxation here again."}
{"text":"This hipster hang out has a very friendly, engaged owner and great coffee. The rest of the staff is nice enough, but they're usually pretty busy in here, so you may feel a little rushed. If you need to get your caffeine fix, this is a solid solution for a good, strong americano."}
{"text":"Analog serves a great cup of joe, I am also a big fan of their sidewalk seating on 17th, perfect for people watching and enjoying some sunshine! I can definitely settle in for a long chat or work session at Analog. Definitely, a busy location though so if you're banking on seating, especially when it's cold outside, you might be out of luck."}
{"text":"Great coffee, great service, great atmosphere, I really like this shop.

Very modern and trendy feel here, not a lazy sunday feel, more of an urban evening place- like you want to wear a clean shirt and nice shoes when you stop in. Not a bad thing though, there are lots of hipster coffee bars around, nice to see a place with a different feel. I love that they saved the old corner store sign and incorporated it in too the decor inside- a nice touch for those who have hung around 17th for way too long ;)

Super clean and modern inside, they make a decent chai latte that is not all sugary and syrupy. Dare i say it they used actual tea leaves not just 3 pumps form a bottle of pre made stuff! *gasp*! 

Didn't try the food, but it looked good. I would go back for sure, but I would treat this as a place to end a nice meal or an evening out with grown ups doing grown up things (ie after the ballet or a gallery opening, etc.) Basically they class it up a little, and i think that is a good thing now and then :)"}
{"text":"Heckuva cuppa joe. You will not get a table. I don't want to sound 'glass half empty', but I want you to know that you need to either arrive 20 minutes before your friends, or enjoy your coffee to go.
You WILL enjoy your coffee though."}
{"text":"We were looking for a coffee spot to hit up before heading back home so I suggested we check out Analog Coffee. I've passed by this place many times while perusing 17th Ave but never stepped inside. Always plenty of people sitting outside working and people watching. I didn't realize they have 6 locations across the city now. Crazy. We came on a Monday afternoon and the place was packed.

The inside is trendy. Love the vinyl records adorning the walls. It's just as busy inside with people working on laptops, studying and catching up with friends. There's also a pastry case upfront. The menu is split into espresso, brewed, steeped teas, alternatives and ice drinks. Two sizes (12oz and 16oz) to choose from. 

- Latte ($5.30 16oz) - Litaly loves his coffee so he went with a cafe latté. Enjoyable.
- Iced chai ($5.20 16 oz) - S wanted something light and cold. This hit the spot.

Cool, hip, trendy people watching spot."}
{"text":"What an amazing eclectic atmosphere, this is where to impress on a first date, and show your creativity instead of the boring Starbucks down the block.

Great corner location with lots of light, and free wifi.

Came in to check out some munchies while waiting for the burg next door at Clive's, and ended up with the lemon tart, which wasn't earth shattering, as to be expected compared to a bakery (probably an unfair comparison).

friendly service.

no amex.

too bad they close so early, 10pm, this place will still be raking it in ;)"}
{"text":"Cozy cafe in the heart of a thriving city! Analog is a great place to sit and chat with friends on the weekend, or curl up and study for exams. I've never eaten at Analog, but I can attest that their coffee is delectable. The only hesitation I have with giving this boutique coffee shop a better rating is the pricing - for the small size of the cups, the prices are quite prestige. Overall, a great shop for hipsters to unite!"}
{"text":"After a stroll along 17th one beautiful Spring day (without snow) we made a coffee stop at Analog.  And I'm so glad we did.  This is the second Analog location that I know of (other one is at the Calgary Farmer's Market).  They locally roast their own beans and have the ever so popular pour-over system for drip coffee.  For some reason I love watching the coffee drip, taking a moment in space & time to remove noise & technology from my mind, relax and smell the coffee.  Since these moments are far & few between, when they happen, I am grateful.  The kids were in tow and were fascinated as well.

This is not a place to rush in and out of if you are in a hurry.  I like you can walk in one door.....follow the counter along as you order & pay and at the end is your coffee fixin's station by a second door, of which you can exit.  

There is a modest amount of seating if you are in for the long haul or want to take a load off.  Sidewalk Citizen Bakery provides Analog with some delectable goodies if you are hungry.  And for a Saturday afternoon it was busy.

The coffee was supreme, service delightful."}
{"text":"Good coffee (brewed on the V60) in a very spacious and modern space. Staff is nice and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, as we barged in just before closing...no hesitation in servicing us or telling us they are closing.  I just noticed the closing time on the door.
Free wifi and good options for both tea and coffee in a trendy, hipster kinda room.
I like!  Would go back!"}
{"text":"I'm a really big fan of Analog. The space is bright, it's clean: a nice reflection of the coffee there. 

After enjoying Fratello at a number of places around town including their pop-up location at the Calgary Farmers' Market it's nice to have a dedicated spot for it on 17th, it's a little more accessible.

The big long benches are beautiful and I also really like how they've kept the old sign above/behind the bar from the locations old convenience store days."}
{"text":"Trendy little coffee shop on 17th Ave. After stuffing our faces nearby at Clive Burger, we decided to check out Analog for an after dinner beverage. I love the decor, very sleek and modern, and judging by their menu, I can tell they focus on their coffee and dont mess around with fancy-schmancy lattes. I ordered a hot chocolate, which I almost regretted afterwards because they tend to be too sweet. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried mine (with a cute little foam design on it) and it was perfect! Not too sweet at all, and the chocolate was divine. I did find it to be a little chilly inside, which was no fun but towards the end of our visit it seemed to warm up. I really enjoyed it here and I will make it a point to return for the steamed milk!"}
{"text":"This is totally a hipster coffee place  ... but I like it.

Coming from a city where a great brew of coffee is revered, I'm happy to see that Analog has stepped up to the plate in Calgary.

It's a bit on the pricey end, but Analog is a great addition to the 17th ave corridor.

Will be back."}
{"text":"It's great to see the third wave coffee movement making its way to Calgary. Phil & Sebastian was always my default spot but on my recent trip to Calgary I went to Analog on 17th ave and was very impressed with the results. Let's review some technical details:

- Locally roasted coffee beans: 
Check. Fratello Roasters 
- Baristas with proper training on pulling espresso
Check. 
- Microfoam quality and Latte Art:
Check.

I've noticed a recent trend with third wave Cafe's to start qualifying their cappuccinos as \"traditional cappuccino\" on their menu due to all the confusion that the frothy Starbucks abominations have caused. 

This was true with Analog and so I ordered their \"traditional cappuccino\". It was very well done. The latte art sported a heart which is by itself not so impressive but was an indication that the barista had good technique with steaming milk (see the picture that I uploaded). The temperature of the milk was perfect, not too hot (very common problem even with many 3rd wave cafes) which brought out the milk's inherent sweetness. The espresso also tasted dynamic and was not over extracted. Overall I was highly satisfied. 

They even have free wifi which is a plus and the location on 17th Ave is vibrant and happening for a city like Calgary which can be very sleepy with all the bedroom communities as you get further away from downtown."}
{"text":"the coffee is coffee. the light is wonderful. sit next to trendy, happy-looking people and eat sub-par banana bread. service is on-point."}
{"text":"I'm in love with Analog. It's such a quaint coffee shop on 17th, I could spend many hours here enjoying a cup of Joe. They have great drinks and the pastries are pretty good as well. The staff are friendly and I would have to say my favorite part was the the pour-over system they are famous for. I loved watching them make the coffee, it was a really neat experience. Making coffee this way just seems so wonderful, and I'm sure it enhances the flavour and frankly all of you senses as you can really smell the coffee as it drips. I love Analog, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Analog, I've been avoiding you. But only because every time I walked by you already had a lineup to the door. I thought I'd wait until I had occasion to visit you with less line and when I could really scope you out properly. Thank mew, dear friend who suggested we meet at Analog. I'm feline it!

I've gotta say, you're doing a much better job than the old convenience store that used to occupy this location. And as you're the store front 17th Ave prodigy of Fratello, you'd better be all about the coffee. Lo and behold, you are!

Though Analog does have an offering of the usual specialty coffees, for once, I do believe the drip coffee is a feature! It's filtered on the spot for you, cup by cup. No worries about coffee sitting in a pot or being over heated. It's done with precision. And while we're on the topic of being about the coffee, don't expect much in the way of lunches, etc. There are a few Sidewalk Citizen sandwiches available, and perhaps a few baked goods, but tis about all (not really a criticism so much as a commentary in case you were going in with an appetite).

One other thing to note about Analog. It really does feel, well, analog. Like, you're there to talk to your friends, your lover or whoever else you're meeting for coffee, not to hunker down on your laptop. It's not set up for that. It's set for the non-digital times in your life. But, there are enough other great local shops for laptop working... I'm a-ok with 17th Ave having one less digitally focused. Just don't all of y'all go following suit. Then there might have to be words."}
{"text":"I just- there are no words. Almost.

Absolutely stunning repurposing of a heritage storefront, great tunes, great art, sandwiches and pastries from Sidewalk Citizen bakery, and most importantly, outstanding coffees from Fratello Coffee Roasters. From what I've seen this place can go toe-to-toe with Phil & Sebastian, which is the gold standard for coffee and coffeehouses in Canada, and that's high praise. The cappuccino I had at the soft opening (3 November, 2012) was among the best I've ever had anywhere. Anywhere."}
{"text":"Feels like the neighborhood coffee shop, great atmosphere, delicious coffee, and friendly people! Best place for people watching!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, I purchase my beans here. Friendly service, great cinnamon bun, and pastries but not much breakfast options. I love to sit outside and work on my laptop on nice days, but traffic is noisy, and if you can't concentrate with music playing best stay inside!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! This is my favourite coffee shop in Calgary. Very clean!"}
{"text":"I can deal with surly attitudes when the coffee is good but they're not brewing up anything special here.  A little heavy on the roast which drowns out the subtle flavors.  Phil & Sebastian were much better and weren't slinging shade."}
{"text":"* Great espresso *

This is a nice bright space that has the feel of a suburban cafe trying to be inner city hip.  It is popular with the laptop camping crowd that staked out their tables with empty coffee cups, glaring laptop screens, and headphones to block out the sighs of people with coffee waiting for tables.

That said, the service was very friendly, and the espresso was the best one I had in Calgary on my visit.  They offered two bean choices and I opted for the single origin Fratello which was a few cents more, but still reasonable.  Nice crema, good mouthfeel, overall a great espresso:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/analog-coffee-17th-ave-calgary?select=orIGvhHL5QnvC38TAFikTA#jr-6zKqHDycINyiyvA7XKQ"}
{"text":"I'm probably going against the grain here but I feel like this place is popular because it's super hipster and trendy looking and not necessarily because the coffee is the greatest ever. My misto was pretty good, although TBH I don't feel like it was a whole ton better than at Starbucks but, I'm no coffee connoisseur so what do I know. The incredibly hipster vibe this place has is more of a con than a pro for me. It has a kind of pretentious feel, if that makes any sense, and that's just not my personal cup of tea. It is also SO loud and packed. I think if you like people watching it could be entertaining because there are families with children alongside hipsters but if you're trying to be productive it's a bit distracting. There are also only outlets at the bar seating along the windows. I think if I come back it will just be with a friend or two to hang out rather than to do work!"}
{"text":"I really, really want to give Analog a higher rating, but I'm mainly giving them three-stars because they're open late. 

I've been to Analog twice this month after 10:30 pm and was uber excited to find a chill place to well, chill.  The desserts are great, and even late at night there was a variety to choose from: cookies, cupcakes, cake, and cake bars* so A+ for that. The service is wonderful too. The young man behind the counter even searched through the pastries to grab us the biggest 'cake bar' because he knew we were sharing. Again, A++ for that. 

The downfall is the drinks. I've ordered lattes and on the last two outings, I got a hot chocolate. I wasn't happy with either of these drinks. My friend even made a joke, \"did you order the hot chocolate, hold the chocolate?\" And sadly, this is what it tasted like. I would go back because I love the late-night cafe culture, and honestly, the service was so great! I think if they can fix the hot chocolate situation, it would be the PERFECT way to spend a beautiful fall night on 17th Ave. 

(*totally forgot what they're called. Jolly bar, I think.)"}
{"text":"The impression around town is that Analog is a hipster coffee shop. This would prove to be true but by saying so would by default make me a hipster; which in itself may in fact be true but a hipster by definition refuses to accept any label especially the the label of being a hipster. But I digress. And yes, this coffee shop is a total scene spot. It would be a great place to meet with friends and have a stimulating conversation over a cup of artisan coffee about such topics as the latest episode of HBO's Girls or how Ked's are the best shoe ever made. But don't expect to find a quiet spot to read your 50 Shades as the local Batista's seem to enjoy making a racket at the espresso grinder. The wall art is eclectic and the place is extremely busy but appears to keep clean. Thumbs up!

What really matters though  is the coffee. Its good. In fact it might be the smoothest cup of black drip I have ever had. Better even then the coffee from the Clover machine at Kawa. Its gotta be the beans! Sure, it was expensive for a large cup of black but it was warranted for such a buttery smooth cup of WOW. In other news, the brownie was oilier than my complexion but tastes far better. 

In conclusion, Analog is a welcome addition to the Uptown 17th coffee scene. Their coffee and tea is not fooling around and is a quality product that needs to be tasted to believe. I'll definitely go back to put a cup of coffee on layaway in the near future because I know that when I can finally afford it, it will be worth it."}
{"text":"Love their tiramisu almont croissants coffee.. one of the few cafes that is open untill midnight.. v love taking coffee n a pastry n walk in the park.. we r a big abt coffee dates n this one of r hot fav places.."}
{"text":"AmaZing coffee in a beautiful setting. Love how the vintage signs are hanging inside!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Used to work close by and went everyday... Now I have withdrawals :)"}
{"text":"I visited for the first time yesterday.  I really like the bright atmosphere, decor and overall vibe of the place, but I wouldn't purposefully return here again.  

Parking is a gong show, as it is for most places on 17th Ave.  The mocha I ordered was only just warm and wasn't overly flavorful.  The baked goods in the cabinet looked edible enough but were way to big for my appetite, so I didn't order anything.  There was nothing available to satisfy a minor sweet tooth craving.  The place feels rather crowded when busy and the benches could use some cushioning.  

You'd think I'd give Analog 2 stars, but the ambiance deserves more than that."}
{"text":"Updated**
After my last review of Analog, I had chatted with the owner. His concern and effort to understand my review made me decide to give this cafe one more chance. I will say there was a complete change of opinion. Today I ordered a half sweet mocha, I was greeted by a happy young woman who took my order. There was a bit of a line up and she moved it a long quite well. The drink I ordered came in about 4 min which I was surprised about because there were quite a few people in front of me. The drink came and was exactly what I wanted. 
In the end I will chalk my other experiences to staffing/new business issues. I saw none of the issues I had before. Thank you for a great coffee!!! 






I have given this cafe several tries and never left satisfied. They gave me the wrong drink once, the second time it was correct but gross and the 3rd time the staff was just plain rude."}
{"text":"Great people watching and decent coffee. Though if we are being honest, I prefer the coffee from Phil & Seb or Beano.

One of the best things I've ever eaten is this smoky bacon and cheddar biscuit. It's a pretty crazy indulgence but I think it's worth it.

Don't bank on getting a seat, best to grab and go."}
{"text":"The espresso is delicious here! Definitely some of the best roast/pull in the city. And the skill from each of the baristas is exceptional. My cappuccino couldn't have been any more perfect. 
Not to mention the location is beautiful."}
{"text":"I was wandering down 17th when the need for a coffee hit me. I love trying out anything independent (I.e. Not Starbucks), so when I cam across Analog, it looked the sufficient amount of interesting, but not crowded. The staff was really friendly and on top of that, the coffee was really tasty."}
{"text":"Great coffee and pretty good service.  The place is well laid out and decorated in a very retro modern way.  It's usually fairly busy and so if you're looking for a quiet place to chat with someone for a meeting then I'd go somewhere else.  It's mainly a place to be seen at the moment."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Perfect place to sit down and chat over coffee. Super friendly staff and great tasting coffee. A little on the pricier side but totally worth it."}
{"text":"With Chiasso gone from the area (the landlord terminated their lease--funny that it is correctly marked as closed on Yelp but not on Chiasso's own website), there was a need for a great coffee shop in the area (some might say Caffe Beano, but I'm not a fan of their service).  We went in yesterday afternoon and ordered a vanilla latte and a caramel latte.  Although mine (caramel) was a bit too sweet, it was one of the best lattes I've ever had.  The cashier / barista was very nice, too.

You might be able to find parking depending what time you go, but this is a very busy area.

I'll definitely be back to Analog."}
{"text":"Although super busy, made sense because it was rush hour, we still managed to find seats. Popular place for meetings and studying. 
Clean place, friendly staff. Everything comes out pretty quick, the employees are constantly on it. Nice decor, and they do a good job of having an open atmosphere for a small space.

Windows let in lots of beautiful sunshine, natural light is the best light. 

For all you instagrammers out there looking for an aesthetic coffee to photograph: Beetroot Latte! It's pink! Super cute and not sweet at all so make sure to grab yourself a sweet pairing like a red velvet cupcake or croissant! 

Definitely a place i'd return when I'm over in calgary."}
{"text":"Lots of plug-ins for people looking to sit down and work. Amazing drinks no matter what you get. Great central area with lots of traffic coming in and out but still seems to be a generally quieter place in regards to noise which is nice. Had a couple of their pastries from time to time as well and would always want to go back for seconds!"}
{"text":"Coffee done right.  Funky coffee shop that knows how to make good espresso coffee drinks.  Gets crowded on the weekend but worth the wait or just get it to go.  Much better than the Starbucks across the street!"}
{"text":"Coffee as good as it gets!  Real baristas making real coffee.  I enjoyed a wonderful machiatto.  Analog = old school = coffee done right."}
{"text":"I love this gem of a place.  So clean and funky fun people.  I love the happy staff in the early am and they seek to take pride in their work.  Thanks for a great place to escape too.  As a business that cleans, it's nice to see more clean coffee places :)"}
{"text":"Calgary is finally developing a decent coffee scene but Analog Coffee is still one of my favorites. There's always a good vibe in this place. I like sitting outside on the European style foldup tables and watching people on 17th Ave."}
{"text":"The perfect end to a great night. I think it was -24 and we had just left a great pizza place. Walking back to the vehicle trying not to freeze to death. Analog which is usually super busy appeared fairly quiet (except for the dozen or so students on their laptops) 

Any I asked for  mocha which could not have been prepared better. Service was super fast Nd the coffee as always was delicious. The atmosphere is hipster with great music and plenty of seating."}
{"text":"This place is super swank, but people on your laptops who finished their coffee an hour ago, GET OUT. Can you not notice the line of 15 people cascading out the doorway?
This establishment is long, as in the cash/prep area goes all the way back and there are not very many places to rest your behindus. Let alone taking up a table with your lappie toppie.
A used vinyl menagerie lives behind the counter, they must have raided Goodwill. It also says free delivery along the back wall, but I have learned these were recycled from the previous corner grocery that lived here.
Pro tip: Don't call in expecting your coffee to be delivered to your doorstep.

There are a few baked goods, my friend got a slice of the banana bread, and she was pleasantly surprised when she took a bite there were flakes of coconut baked in. If that had been my banana bread, I would have been upset. The only places for coconut flakes are in rice and ice cream. 

So, it's busy, constantly, but they made me a nice coffee, with a heart. I thanked the barista for the love.

It was a warm day, so we sat in front of Analog with our beverages. A guy came up with a dog and the couple sitting behind us offered to watch his pup while he went in. He was gone so long that several people on the street stopped and complimented this adopted dog owner of her beautiful dog. 
Slow service? Lazy dog ownership? I don't know.

As we were leaving, someone grabbed a spare outdoor chair to use as a foot rest while she read her book.

I feel this place is going to perpetuate snob coffee shop behaviour.

My coffee was nice and I can happily say this review was written in the comfort of my own home, not in a busy coffee shop."}
{"text":"A busy, hopping place to be on a Saturday.   The interior is trendy and filled with a variety of people and ages.    I loved seeing the Starbucks just across the street totally empty, as coffee drinkers become more discerning.   
I had a chai latte and it was very flavorful and rich.   The service is good, they have a lot of people working to keep up with the busy traffic of people.   On a beautiful chinook winter day they had their patio chairs out to allow people to enjoy their hot beverages.   I really enjoyed the art on the wall and vibe of this local gem."}
{"text":"Definition of \"serendipity\" follows.

Happened to be driving on 17th Ave SW in Calgary this afternoon. We were looking for a place to sit and enjoy people watching and, by chance, stopped in at Analog Coffee.

Had the usual cappuccino and sandwich.

Thought I would try a tea and a pastry before we left.

Ordered my usual Earl Grey tea, but wanted to try something other than an croissant or banana bread.

Settled on a simple pastry - an apple \"Kougan Aman\".  I had never had one. Server asked me if I wanted it warmed up in the microwave. After a brief moment of indecision, agreed to the warming.

It was slightly sticky when I tore off a small piece and tasted it.

Oh. 

My. 

Fucking. 

God.

Imagine the absolute best apple pie you have ever had, or will have.

Now imagine something better than that.

I craved a side of the absolute best scoop of vanilla ice cream that I could imagine.

Promptly went back to the server and bought up all the apple ones left.  Was disappointed there were only three.

Bought an extra chocolate one to try later.

Person in line behind me wanted to try one.

Offered her one of mine for $100. 

She declined. Her loss.

Had an epiphany.

Told the serving staff about it.

With marijuana soon to be legalized in Canada, they should consider adding 'weed' to the recipe.  I will be first in line to buy all of them.  

When I left the store, a fellow customer said he would be in line first.

I said \"We shall see\".
___________

If you have read this far, and are still only thinking of stopping at Analog Coffee to try one of these pastries, do not think. Do.

Not today though if you want apple. They are gone."}
