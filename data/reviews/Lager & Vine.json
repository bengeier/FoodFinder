{"text":"First time dining at this establishment. Was much larger than I thought it would be. My husband and I went without our children and I probably wouldn't take them here- seems to be a more upscale, quiet place to dine. Food was really fantastic. My husband had the scallop dish and I had the hanger steak dish. My steak was cooked perfectly and we were both very happy with our dishes. The only thing that I found (slightly) bothersome was that the lighting was a little too dark. Very nice place, would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this restaurant 3 times. Each time the service was bad and the drinks weren't mixed right. The last time was the most disappointing. The servers were more interested in flirting with eachother and drinking than in taking care of customers. I ordered a tomato saled and the tomatoes were mealy. The manager took it off our bill but didn't stop to apologize (the place wasn't busy). So sad because I was really excited about a new restaurant on the square."}
{"text":"This review is for our most recent visit on 12/22.  We have eaten here a couple times before and always enjoyed the food and service.  This past visit will be our last.  Based on past experience I suggested Lager & Vine to my family.  All 12 were seated by 5:45 and the place was at most 50% full.  We ordered 3 appetizers and 2 salads between 12 people.  At 7:00 our dinners were served.  45 minutes after placing our dinner order.  3 of the first 4 dishes served were barely luke warm to cool.  Poor food on top of a long wait only compounds the problem.

Went face to face with owner who insisted it was 25 minutes from order in to order out but he could not explain the multiple cool dishes - which wouldn't have happened if the food had actually been turned around in 25 minutes.  He never did apologize to my party for the wait or poor food.  Arrogant owners who can't believe they did any wrong are the restaurants worst ambassador.  He may think his s**t doesn't stink, but on this night his food did."}
{"text":"We had a party of 6 with a reservation. I was a few minutes early and the first to arrive and was seated at out table in the back room. It was at leat 5 minutes before i was approached and the waiter wanted to know how many people and when I thought they would arrive, which was a strange question. He then started to walk away with out asking if I wanted anything while I was waiting. I stopped him and asked if he could turn up the heat as I was freezing and had to put my coat back on. There was no one else seated at the time in that room. He instead asked if I wanted coffee or tea to help me warm up which I thought was nice until I got my bill and realized he charged me $2.50 for one cup of tea which he never refreshed with warm water for the rest of the evening. He also did not turn up the heat which did not surprise me as he shrugged his shoulders when I asked as if he thought I was nuts. The rest of the evening the service didn't get any better. He was nice enough, but did not come back and check on us. He forgot several things we ordered and we had to hunt him down and then he carged us the regular price for the taco special and we had to hunt him down again to fix our bills. 
The food was ok. The lobster bisque was good, but not over the top good. It could have used more sheery and seasoning. The taco's were all pretty good, the homemade tater tots very good. The flat bread pizza's were dry and felt like they were thrown together in a hurry. The pretzels were good and piping hot, but we had to hunt our server down again to get plates to share. When I got home and looked at my left overs of the flatbread pizza, it looked as if he had picked up the plate and dumped it in the box, some slices were upside down, some were sideways and all of the toppings were off the pizza and all over. 
I will give this place one more try to see if this was a fluke. We felt the food was overpriced for what we recieved and the service, even though he was nice, was terrible. I hope they fix the problems or they won't last long."}
{"text":"My boyfriend checked this place out when he knew we were going to visit family and we knew we had to come here for a dinner.

My last evening while on holiday, we took my family out for dinner here. We reserved the day before with no problems. The day of, they called us back and asked us if we were fine in a booth that normally fits 4 for our group of 5 due to a wedding party reservation. Turns out this was just fine and we were well taken care of.

Located right on the beautiful Medina Square, Lager & Vine is a wonderful and classy restaurant and is impeccably decorated. Service is also quite good--I tend to get annoyed in the US when their service provides too much attention (I know, something silly to even complain about) but I found that here they made a good balance of paying enough attention to get you drinks, take your order, etc. but also didn't hover too much. 

The food and drink was out of this world! There a numerous delicious wines and beers available. I stuck to beer that night and was delighted with all the different local beers avaialble. Both my boyfriend and I tried the sampler of beers (4 or 5 different kinds) and clearly had our favorites (among those IPAs). For food, we had the pretzels and Lager & Vine House Chips. Everyone loved the Chips (I had one with no meat and it was great!) and the pretzels with the cheese and mustard sauces were to die for! For the main course, I had the Tiquila Chipotle Shrimp Tacos and loved these! Although it didn't include much, it was delicious...also make sure to get the homemade tator tots--I'm normally not such a huge fan but they hit the spot. Everyone else was just as pleased with their dinners as I was. Unfortunately, we were all so stuffed that none of us could fit dessert in (I guess there's not always room for dessert?).

Will definitely go back again to try some of their other items--they have plenty of fish and vegetarian options for me!"}
{"text":"Great food, the beef tip pasta is my favorite.  Great wine and craft beer selection. The homemade tater tots are awesome."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place by accident. This place is awesome!! I will be back!! I had the burger with an IPA and both were great. I ordered the burger medium and it came out med-well but tasted great non the less. The meal came with tater tots that were huge! 

Beer list is great. The decor is very hipster with the barn wood walls

Try it out if you're in medina"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Awesome service (Mike ROCKS), good beer, and fantastic food, good ambience... all around great place to go.  Had the chips (delish!) and tuna sashimi for an app.  Highly recommended.  The lobster bisque was good as well.  I had the salmon and it was cooked perfectly.  Very good experience!!!  I will be back ;)"}
{"text":"Good food. Okay device. Recommend the grilled cheese. Salmon salad with artichokes was flavorful. Irish crme cheesecake was outstanding."}
{"text":"Food atmosphere and service first rate. Full menu,not bar food at all. What a pleasant surprise in Medina.
Get the homemade tater tots - there out of this world."}
{"text":"Carol and I had burgers - bacon burger and bleu burger. Carol had fries and thought they were very good. Nice and hot too.  I had the tater tots and they are to die for. 

Both burgers were very good and cooked as ordered. Both were \"knife and fork\" style burgers, unless wearing a bib. 

French onion soup was very tasty and served nice and hot. It seemed a bit skimpy on cheese and onions though. Otherwise our review would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The interior is dated, the food is amateur-ish and overpriced. Not much flavor. Service was good though. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Lots of options for large, medium, or small meals, plates to share and plates to keep to yourself. Nothing groundbreaking in my personal opinion, but it has a wonderful cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Lobster bisque was outstanding! 
It was a little dark inside,  but nice atmosphere.  Our waitress was very nice. 
The mussels were cooled to perfection.
The craft beer left a lot to be desired! 
Very short list of them and most not very good.  I would have thought with Lager as the first part off the name they would have had a better selection."}
{"text":"Drink selection was subpar especially for a place named lager and vine. Food was ok. Nothing on the menu was that original. Service wasn't good. Took a long time for the server even to greet us and refill our water and the place was basically empty. Atmosphere could use a redo. Bland appearance and very split up with a small bar upfront and booths in the back. We sat on a row of booths against the wall that just had a blank wall opposite it which should just not be used for that reason. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Very overpriced and I would not recommend dining here. 
It wasn't a completely horrible experience though... The server's beer recommendations were spot on, the stuffed peppers (though cold) were really flavorful and the highlight of the meal. The rest was well below average despite being priced quite high. 
The majority of us chose to go with a few small plates a piece, and even though there were a couple of the same dishes...no 2 looked the same ( different portion sizes, one plate of scallops was seared on both sides the other on just one, different meat temps., etc.).  In general I can safely say the whole meal was poorly prepared by people who were very inexperienced. The one constant was everything was cold and had been sitting for a good bit. 
Like I said before, the majority of the dinner was disappointing...but one thing stood out as offensively horrible...the crab cake. Hands down the worst crab cake I've ever had in my life. Bone dry, completely flavorless, and on top of a bed of rubbery frozen corn. If you make the mistake of dining here....save yourself $16 and avoid this disgusting plate...stick with the other overpriced dishes. At least then you'll be just disappointed and not angry."}
{"text":"Went here the other day. Excellent beer choices. Service was good, server was very knowledgable and helpful. Good portions. The bruschetta was fantastic! I got the filet mignon and was cooked perfectly. Will definitely be back again. Also happy hour prices are a plus."}
{"text":"Could have been great, but bad service to first time customer is a deal breaker.

Came early evening with very limited customers competing for blonde bartender's attention.  Unfortunately, she was more concerned about talking with friends at another table about her recent hair color change. We received sporadic service and I actually was semi-understanding until after waiting patiently to get her attention she refused to give me the happy special on wine because it was 6:02.  I really was shocked given that I would have had plenty of time to get the order in if she actually was paying proper attention to us.  The food was okay and the wine was not bad, but her total disregard for treating customer's well turned me off and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Very nice and yet cosy atmosphere. Luved the bar area. The wines and the sushi selections were amazing. Luved everything off the menu. Everyone is very friendly and made sure we had a great time. Special thanks to Rachel and Shelby for making it a nice experience. Would most definitely come back. Highly recommend this place. 
Thx 
DR MD"}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed. Was really hoping to find a new spot in Medina. I hear that the quality of food is different than the Hudson location. I've ordered flatbread there 2x (gave it a second chance) but came up disappointed again. Does have s great little bar to stop by and grab a glass of wine"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a group today after having dinner last week. I have also been to their Hudson location for dinner a few months ago, so I was familiar with the menu and food concept. They have taken a former restaurant space that had been dormant for at least three years and did a very good remodeling job, taking out some of the booths, installing some nice rough wood wall treatments and very pleasing and attractive lighting.
The food concept is \"small plates\", and I'll admit that I've never been a fan, as the portion sizes shrink quite a bit and the prices don't. They suffer from the same problem, although the lunch selections are not overly small and they do offer a nice \"combo\" value for soup and salad or sandwich.

The \"Lager\" refers to the good selection of beers that they have on tap, and they are one of the few places that I have found the very tasty \"Crispin\" hard cider. They also have quite a few wines on tap and their selection is good although a bit on the higher priced side.

Now the good: excellent lobster bisque, caesar salad, and stuffed pepper appetizer (only available at dinner).
Very good \"small plates\" at dinner: crab cake, Maine clams, and sliced filet.

Not so good: service was slow and they seemed a bit overwhelmed. Understandable if this was really a \"new' operation, but their Hudson menu and management experience could have (should have) made them better prepared. Orders were slow to be taken and water refills were pretty much nonexistent. I had the burger, cooked \"medium\" and it came out well done and also without any of the condiments I had requested.

All in all, I will be back, as Medina needs more options downtown, and there is a lot of promise here. Nice article in the Gazette today, and the owner was quoted as saying he would love to have people have a drink at Thyme2, have dinner at L&V and then have an after dinner beer at Sully's. Hmmm, good idea!!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, awesome wines... Best bet is to ask or hope for Andrew as your server! Be sure to ask for specials, and take your server's advice!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for my wife's birthday lunch at noon on Friday. We were the only ones there but a few others came while we were there. As an IPA fan, I loved the draft beer list! Wife had a berry lemonade which she raved about.
Now for the food porn... To say the Bacon burger was decadent is an understatement! Great flavor, juicy, cooked just right! Gives b spot a run for its money in terms of top flight burgers in town.  We'll likely be back to try out dinner menu soon.
Only complaint was the bathrooms. Downstairs, dingy, kind of gross to be honest. Only hesitation to go back would be the direct violation of Anthony Bourdain's rule on clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"The chicken tacos (supposed to be spicy but weren't very) were really good. The appetizer, chips with gorgonzola and bacon, was good but too rich and salty by far. We ate about half and had to send it away.  The bartenders were nice. I would definitely make a return trip."}
{"text":"The first time we visited it was alright the salmon with some of the best I've had.  Second time around wasn't so great.  The already small portions seem to get smaller and service was something to be desired.  Lost reservations and slow service for drinks and refills was something to be addressed.  Overall the food is good but you don't get much for what you pay for."}
{"text":"We attended on a Friday night, and it was quite busy. That said, our waitress was pretty chilly and inattentive. The food is American fare: much of which you can find in other local restaurants, done better. When a restaurant states they are a gastropub, I would expect to see more exotic proteins than chicken, beef and lobster - especially at the prices they wanted. Generally, the experience was fine, but I probably won't take guests there, or go back myself."}
{"text":"The pluses:
* The only place I know of in Medina to have valet (I could be wrong but I haven't seen it anywhere else since Thyme moved).
* One of the few places in Medina that takes reservations.
* The Caprese Salad was really good, and that's saying a lot for tomatoes in winter in Ohio.
* Some unique options on draft. Not often you find Victory Golden Monkey on tap around here.
* Entrees were yummy - I had a burger (it was huge!) and my fiancee had a seafood pasta. We both enjoyed the meal.
* Not overly pretentious. Lots of differently dressed people, atmosphere is nice (think: rustic), without being stuffy.
* Servers (bartenders and our dinner server) were friendly, had a good sense of humor, and made some solid recommendations.

The minuses:
*  If you DON'T have reservations, expect a long wait, especially since people are coming in droves to try it out. TIP: Seating in the immediate bar area (all the hi-top tables) is first-come, first served.
* If you don't valet, it may be a challenge to find a parking spot.
* Prices are not bad, but higher than others in this city. Remember, the first location is in Hudson, and everything is priced higher there. :)
* If you're out for a family dinner with kids, not sure this is the place, unless it's maybe a weeknight dinner.

Overall - I enjoyed it. I have a goal to avoid \"big chain\" locations this year at all costs, so I can see this being a regular addition to our restaurant location. I'm not going for 5 stars since the reservation/parking issue kind of irks me (essentially, if you don't have a reservation, they make one for you at a later time)."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here a week ago. All the food was awesome (chips and cheese, bacon burger, chorizo Mac n cheese, flatbread pizza and sirloin tip pasta). Good draft selection. We weren't crazy about our first drafts and waiter even offered to refund and replace them, although it wasn't that bad (it's all relative). Nice ambiance and deceptively large seating area. We're fans and I'll definitely be back. A nice addition to the Medina Square."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Yum! Great to see non-bar/fried food in Medina. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to write this because I really did love this place, but since my last review (8 months ago) I have been there another 4 or 5 times and every time it's a little worse. The food is nothing to write home about, as well as the service. I just found out that they have had 3 chefs since it's opened and you can tell. Something is always different... and not in a good way.  For the price they charge I would expect more than mediocre... which is the best word to describe my last few visits. I still think it's a cool place and the red Sangria is awesome, but I think I will stick to drinks and maybe an app if/when I do come again."}
{"text":"Fabulous dining experience! Server was great. Food was top-notch. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place has good atmosphere. Right on the square. Stopped in for 'lunch'. The place was pretty dead, but it was 2pm. I figure on any given weekend evening it may really shine. Most of the servers were just standing around near the bar. We sat right across from the kitchen, so that kept us occupied. The restaurant was overall very quiet and the kitchen had a good selection of music going. I usually like to take it easy and hang out a while between apps and entree, ect. but it was 2pm; we were hungry! Food took for-ev-er considering. Was worth the wait. Everything was delicious!!  Some of the best fries I have ever had. My bacon burger was cooked perfectly. Great upscale style pub fare."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed an excellent experience here last evening. Our server was prompt and spot on with her recommendations. The hand cut chips and cheese were very tasty, and served hot. I had the chorizo Mac and cheese, she had a flatbread. Both were hot from the kitchen. We enjoyed the atmosphere, and we will return to try other menu options. I felt the cost was reasonable."}
{"text":"Came to medina from Los Angeles to visit friends and went here for lunch. Very impressive and Andrew did a great job.
Great lobster bisque and my burger with egg on top was super.."}
{"text":"It was just \"ok\". I paid $15 for a small salad so I think it's a bit overpriced. Wasn't impressed. Won't be back."}
{"text":"First, I love places that do small plates. It's so hard to finish portions at a restaurant now.

The beer and wine selection here fits with the name. Don't worry, they have fun drinks here as well! I had the sangria which was pretty good but had a little too much orange juice in it. Still delightful though.

I had the lunch combo with the lobster bisque and the grilled cheese. The bisque was quite good. Very creamy with a hearty helping of seafoody goodness. The grilled cheese on the other hand was pretty boring. Just some bread and kraft singles like I would have made at home for my niece and nephew. I was hoping for a little more pizazz...maybe bacon or fancy cheese? Dipping the sandwich into the soup saved the day though. 

Overall I loved the vibe and most of my order. I would definitely try this place out again!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite dinner spots! We usually save it for a semi special occasion because it can get expensive. Everything I've had here I really liked and I'm a picky eater! House chips for an app are yummy, seafood pasta is great too. I really love this place, great staff and great food and it's kind of a dark sexy place for a romantic dinner. Try it out!!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Lager and Vine as a family for a Saturday lunch. We all ordered different things from the menu and they were all very good. Service was excellent also. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food cool atmosphere. Priced a little high for the amount of food you get but still great flavors. Feels like a classic pub yet fancy. Service was good and drink choices on tap were local it was very cool."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and we ordered the flatbreads which were large enough to split one. I loved the presentation but most importantly the taste was excellent for flat bread. Missing a star for service, but it was the lunch hour. Will definitely be back to continue to explore the menu."}
{"text":"I've just visited Lager & Vine for the second time and for the second time I've had a really satisfying meal. The menu is chock full of well-crafted entrees, with no pretention. The food is as good as it sounds. I loved the burger as well as the Voodoo Chicken tacos I tried last night. And don't get me started on the tots!  Okay, I'm started.... they're not Ore'Ida, that's for sure!  Huge, crispy, soft, delicious tater tots! I also had a really great wedge salad. Nice size.
I enjoy the wine and beer list, too, there's always something new to try.

My only con is that some of the dishes aren't priced appropriately. My friend ordered a caprese salad for $7 and we both thought the portion was chincy. She was finished with it before I even finished cutting up my wedge.

The service is wonderful- friendly and breezy.

Update 8.14.15: OMG try the Flatbread Blanco. It's a salty, cheesy heaven. So delicious."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Had the simple chicken and it was juicy and the pepper bacon confit was good. My wife had the bbq chicken flatbread and it was tasty. But by far the best thing about the restaurant was our server, Michael, who was infectiously joyful and funny."}
{"text":"Dinner for two took 1 hour and 45 minutes on Saturday at 5.  

Inexperienced wait staff,  filet that's mostly grizzle, butchered ahi tuna and missing sides.  

Great location but no parking.  

Will wait a year to try it again having had two weak experiences since the opening date!"}
