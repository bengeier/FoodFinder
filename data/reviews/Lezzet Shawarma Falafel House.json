{"text":"Poor experience today. Won't be going back.  I work near this place, and have gone once or twice for lunch. I went today, carrying my personal bottle of tap water, as I tend to. As I ordered a falafel sandwich to eat there, the employee at the cash told me that I couldn't eat there if I was bringing in my \"personal food and drink\". I told her it was just tap water, and she told me it wasn't right to bring other people's food and drink into a restaurant. Of course, she's right, but if it was a real restaurant, she would have poured me glass of tap water!  I took my sandwich to go. There are plenty of other good falafel/shwarma places around that won't give you a hard time over a bottle of water. Panorama or Bamiyan Kebab, just north of Eglinton, come to mind.  The sandwich didn't even end up being that good."}
{"text":"I just came from Poland. Shwarma is best. 5 star. Staff very friendly. Food very good. Service great."}
{"text":"We were just here for lunch and were very displeased with the service. There was no sign as to where to stand to order therefore we stood at the end of what where we thought the line was. Everyone watched us stand there, yet no one said anything about it being the wrong place. After about 10 minutes, another customer walked in right up to the cash register and ordered his meal. We realized we were in the wrong place finally and moved over. The service was slow and unfriendly. Having lived in Ottawa, I know a good shawarma, and this place was not it. Save your time and money and find a different shawarma shop."}
{"text":"Best shawarma I've had in Mississauga! This was the first wrap I ate where the contents weren't spewing out - it's well wrapped so there is no drip and no mess! And it's not dry either, they put several sauces in it (and the perfect amount too)."}
{"text":"It never occurred to me that I was living so close to such a gem of a place, until a friend told me about it. One of the best shawarma I have ever eaten. Period :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for dinner ... I like chicken shawarma wrap,it was good with the shawarma sauce ,garlic sauce and little bit of hot sauce"}
{"text":"Not sure why the hype here. Shawarma is incredibly tiny; little meat and even less pickled items included. I suppose you get what you pay for with a shawarma pita costing 6.75 but, completely unauthentic - even BBQ sauce put in the wrap!  Two stars BC the staff was friendly, place was clean, low price."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to come here - had lezzet bookmarked for quite a while and my family and I were craving for some good shawarma. This is the first time my fellow yelpers have disappointed. I don't understand how this place is rated 4.5*?!?! Makes me wonder who's frequenting the establishment and who is writing these reviews.   Let me make something very clear - this place is NOT authentic Mediterranean and does not offer authentic shawarma. Don't get me wrong, the taste was fresh, the taste was okay. BUT the portions were measly and we all left hungry. I kid you not, my partner's salad portions were a tablespoon each. That makes 4 tablespoons of salad. The beef and rice were also very small portions. The shawarmas were incredibly flat and empty and the sauce - oh wait there was barely residue of sauce in the pita. When I asked for more I was informed they did not have any...what!? While the workers were quite friendly and Spanish (not Mediterranean) they were incredibly light-handed with their servings. Finally, the prices are comparable to other establishments.   I will not be coming back here. The quantity and overall experience is not worth the money. They pride themselves off of being one of the highest rated restaurants on Yelp in Mississauga however, they have just over 20 reviews which I came to learn the hard way, are not reliable. Disappointing... Save yourself the time, money and appetite (because you will leave hungry anyways).   Happy yelping!"}
{"text":"Nice place, good feel inside with ample seating. Workers are nice, food is very fresh and ok priced. Some of the best falafel I have ever had in the GTA, they season it so well. If in the area I recommend trying them out."}
{"text":"Amazing homestyle shawarma plates. The flavour is amazing, everything super fresh and I was told sauces were made from scratch. Delicious!!!! No shawarma place like this one"}
{"text":"I would've given them 5 stars, but I found a long hair on my shawarma platter.  I did not complain since this only happened once out of the many times that I've been there, but I thought I'd mention it here in case someone else found one too.  Other then that, great service!"}
{"text":"Very clean, fresh, and tasty. Prices are very reasonable, and there is lots of seating space. Best falafel in the GTA in my opinion."}
{"text":"The best shawarma restaurant I have found in Mississauga and even around Mississauga. I've eaten there at least 30 times already. It's family owned and ran. The service is extremely great. If you are a shawarma fanatic like me than you MUST try their shawarma, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I got the beef shawarma wrap, really good! the only reason I ranked it 4 not 5 was because I added a spicy marinated lemon which almost ruined the wrap also their turnips are lack luster and really dull in colour which is a shame because turnips really make a shawarma wrap."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Great food. Affordable. I ordered the daily combo."}
{"text":"My favorite Shawarma place in Mississauga. Very healthy food and welcoming staff. I go there regularly."}
{"text":"Come here for the chicken shawarma meat on fries. Hands down among the best food I've ever had. The skinny fries they have are comparable to Mcdonalds fries.. but crispier.  Come well before closing time cause they often come close early."}
{"text":"Ok folks! this is an all star place as I have had many shawarmas but this one had a different taste (to the better) to it.   We went there during lunch time. The service was really good and the staff was very friendly in serving us. The server even told us to eat first, enjoy and pay afterwards. The cashier (the owner) was very friendly and she described to me that they are Persian and not middle eastern and that is why the spices are different. All their sauces are home made and yummy.  we ordered all chicken shawarama plate and a mixed meat plate. These come with 3 different types of salad and hummus & garlic sauce on the side, as usual the meat comes on top of the rice.  Although the portions seems small but the meal is filling and I was having hard time in the to finish it up.   They have 2 flat screen and had soccer going on it.  Overall very enjoyable experience!  For my Muslim folks- They serve halal meat stated on their website and door."}
{"text":"Lezzet was highly recommended by a few friends. The chicken shwarma and beef shwarma platters were tasty and moist. This is now my favorite go to restaurant for my Meditterean fix. Staff were very friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Great food, fast.  The staff is really friendly.  At our work (Our Kids Media) we love to here to get lunch for the office."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. Fresh, tasty and generous portions. The guys who work here are great too! Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch. The first thing I noticed was the clean interior.   When ordering my food, the staff was friendly. I got the chicken platter, and was expecting a lot more food than I got - the portions were small in my opinion. The food itself was delicious - the sauces they use are unique and go well with the platter.  Overall, I will be back here and will recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly staff. Best shawarma place in Mississauga. The falafel's  are the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Best shawarma going, food is always fresh , staff always friendly, never disappoints, best falafel in town made from scratch."}
{"text":"This was sooo good.  I am obsessed with chicken shawarma and will go to almost any shawarma joint.  I found this place to be a little better than the rest.  The pita was $5-6 which is pretty average-cheap but the quality is great.  The \"shawarma artists\" can be a little over-eager with the toppings so make sure to let them know if there is something you don't like or have an allergy to.  Unlike most shawarma places, the restaurant is somewhere I'd actually feel comfortable sitting down in so that's another plus.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, i like they're shawarma wrap. But when i asked for extra toppings like jalape√±os she said that she would charge me 50 cents. I mean wtf? But o well, 50 cents is nothing but she only added like 5pcs though . Lol"}
{"text":"Thumbs up: good prices, a tad cheaper than some of the other options in the area. Fresh toppings and this spicy pickled something (garlic and eggplant maybe?) was especially good.  Thumbs down: Menu inside is quite different from the pamphlets they give out. Some of the options on the pamphlet aren't actually available (i.e. Donair (Beef &Lamb) wrap/sandwich  Schwarmas. How do you differentiate between them? Imho, you need some good, distinctive toppings. The main components of Lezzet's Chicken schawarma is good, but fairly run of the mill. The veggies were fresh and the sauces were mostly average. There was one topping, a spicy pickled veggie that was particularly distinctive, it added a nice kick to the pita, but it doesn't quite add enough to put this place over the top compared to Pita and Grill which is up the street. It's a toss up between the two.  The prices are a bit lower than other options in the area and the restaurant is clean. Chicken Schawamra pita came to $5.50 after taxes. See pictures for additional pricing.  If you're looking for it, it's in the corner of the plaza ACROSS from Rockwood mall."}
{"text":"I happened to be in Mississauga doing business and then I want a quick fix for lunch.  I ordered mixed shawarma platter for $9.95 before tax and there is variety in the platter.   You would get four kinds of salads plus hummus as sides and shawarma + (saffron?) rice as main. The salads are a lot. The shawarma is ok in size but is tasty.   I took lunch on Sunday about 2.30pm and people kept coming in it seems this is a popular local eatery.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 3.5/5 - clean shawrma place but it gets an extra 0.5 because of the two large screen TVs.  Got to watch the Olympics while eating and not a pub, so bonus!  Service: 3/5 - it's a takeout counter, but they are fast and friendly and you get to see everything made in front of your eyes.  Food/pricing: 3.25/5 Ordered a mixed shawrma platter that had chicken and beef.  All the veggies and rice was fresh.  However, I found the food and sauce slightly bland.  It's better than Paramount, but it's not out of this world.  In addition, the meat was a bit overcooked and too dry for my liking.  Regardless, my huge platter only costs $10 including tax, so its fairly cheap.  Verdict: might visit again, but I feel downtown TO has so much better quality."}
{"text":"Great place to get a Shawarma. By far one of the cleanest Shawarma places I've been too. I had a falafel sandwhich, the vegetables were very fresh and the falafel was not overcooked or over greasy.  The staff was friendly and they have a huge projector screen playing sports, usually soccer."}
{"text":"Great looking restaurant. Two flatscreen tvs to keep people entertained.  Menu board and decorations are very tasteful.  Ordered two chicken shawarma platters Service was very fast. Patron helping us was very nice and gave us all the options available.  Food was absolutely amazing. Chicken is perfectly cooked, rice is perfectly cooked and seasoned; salads are good. Sauces (tzatziki, hummus and garlic sauce are all very good) One of the best shawarma places in Missussauga."}
{"text":"This place is unreal soo f****n good their alli j (chicken on rice or fries) is bomb I usually get it on both."}
{"text":"Its true! This place is legit. I now know why everyone seems to prefer this place more. Best (so far) shawarma in Mississauga! My family loved it and the other usual place we get our shawarma from doesn't compare anymore. And its ridiculously close to where we are so the travel time just cut in half for us.  Am more a chicken wrap type of customer but their platter also is so good! Well portioned.  Anyway, when you get the chance just try this place..My family will be a repeat customer for sure!"}
{"text":"So it was my first time at Lezzet .  Fairly good prices and very tasty Shwarma !  I got the mix platter of chicken and beef and it was fantastic ...tasted fresh and authentic !  Service was good , very friendly and helpful !  I'd definitely come back again !"}
{"text":"I've reviewed this place before, giving them 2 stars. My complaint was that the tables were very messy despite being generally quiet in the restaurant and the blandness of the chicken. Also that the owner had parked his car in the handicap spot without displaying a valid permit.   I'm now going to lower my rating to a 1 star. Here's why: over the last two weeks, I've been messaged by several people who have left 1 star reviews stating that they have received threatening messages on Yelp for leaving their opinions in this forum which has been designed to share opinions, reviews, feedback for others to read.   This person, who contacted these people with threatening messages, clearly has a bias to this restaurant and is possibly employed by or has a relationship with the proprietor of this establishment.   For an individual to contact reviewers on Yelp and threaten them is not only immature but it is also extremely unprofessional and defeats the purpose of having an app like Yelp to share opinions. To be called names for having different tastes than someone else is so absolutely idiotic, which leaves me to question the intelligence of this person who contacted reviewers of this establishment with threatening messages.   To the person who did that, and we all know who you are, you my friend are a coward. Please refrain from threatening people on Yelp for sharing their opinions; because the mere fact that you did that contradicts the point of Yelp. So either play by the rules and stop threatening people or grow a set and learn how to take some constructive criticism.r"}
{"text":"The fries here are absolutely perfect. They are thin and crispy and I highly recommend anything with fries. My go-to order is the Ali J with chicken and fries. Super easy to order and quick subway style pick up. The wraps here are also really good but I recommend the Ali J the most."}
{"text":"Good Enough !  It was our first time here and wanted to try something new. By the look of it, the ambience is pretty good with the traditional Mediterranean outlook.   I ordered a Chicken Shawarma Wrap and a Mixed (Chicken+Beef) Shawarma Wrap. The service was quick and the server added all the vegetables and sauces in ok quantities. No option for whole wheat Wrap. Each Wrap is $6.19 and Platters are $9.75 each. At the end he grilled the 2 wraps as well.   The taste was good, however not enough spicy, more on the bland side and in the first few bites it was dry as well. It wasn't as juicy as expected. They are considered to be very healthy and do have many celebrity endorsements displayed as well.   It's a good try, but there are others which are better !! Sorry but wasn't totally satisfied !"}
{"text":"This place is definitly not authentic Mediterranean it's more of a twist. The food was decent but the chicken was a bit burnt. The portion for the meat was not worth the money. Will definitely not fill you up."}
{"text":"Best shawarma around by far. Fast friendly great price. The place to eat for lunch or dinner in Mississauga"}
{"text":"Best Shawarma of all time. ALL TIME! Service is great. A bunch of Bros that know their stuff. Great ambiance. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite shawarma joint. Highly recommend the mix platter or the Ali j. Great service and always fresh."}
{"text":"Pros: Pretty good shawarmas, I really enjoyed their falafes, one of the best falafes I've ever had, you can taste the fresh ingredients, special mention for the very yummy hummus cream. Everything is fresh and tasty. The place is ok and very clean and has 2 huge TVs with sports (soccer) so I'll give them an extra point for that. Staff is super friendly and good looking (another exra point).   Cons: Menu could have more variety, and portions could be bigger.  Overall, good food, good service and good experience 8/10..."}
{"text":"I was here the other day to order food. Just finished playing baseball and was hungry and wanted to get something good and filling after a good baseball win.  Ordered the chicken platter for $12 all in.  Waited about 10 mins to get my food 3 things i've noticed.   1. The owner parks his car in the handicap spot right out front. Very douche and would imagine that parking lot is saved for customers not owners  2. It was hot and humid outside yet the business didnt have their AC on so it was hotter inside waiting for your food. I find it cheap when restaurants don't turn on their AC in their restaurant.  3. The tables looked cleaned but upon resting my arms on them the they had a sticky film residue weird.  ah well i was getting my food TO GO not my problem.  So i drive home bring the food home unpacked my gear and looking forward to enjoy this meal and once again the chicken portion is not even a lot.  like 25% of the to go box which is a huge rip off.  Anywhere else i go this would be 50% of the box.  The cuts of the chicken weren't even tasty at all.  The worst part about the whole meal is midway thru i was eating i felt hair texture in my mouth.  Low and behold i pulled a long strand of hair out of my mouth.  mid size about the same length of guy that put my food together.  Once that happened i just threw my food in the garbage.  My advice to the company please have everybody wear hair nets there PLEASE. Please Will i go back here again NEVER i spent $12 for salad fries and some chicken LOL get the eff out of here i work to hard for money to give it away to these foolds.  But i hope going forward they wear Hair Nets and i wish i went to the Subway across the street instead of going here. Lesson learned go to Subway."}
{"text":"The food and prices are great however, I want to give a SHOUT OUT to the staff. The lady that serves us almost every weekend or evening we have gone is just delightful and sweet. Really a pleasure to chat with.   Makes a big difference when the food is prepared with love and not attitude.   Thanks doll for always smiling."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times and always receive great food and service at a great price. If you are around Mississauga and want sharwama THIS IS THE PLACE TO EAT!"}
{"text":"Their signature shawarma sauce is very good. This place had a pretty long line - be mindful of this when going there for lunch during work."}
{"text":"I love this place. Nice people and delicious food. My husband and I go there everything we crave for eating out. I've never gotten disappointed. love it."}
{"text":"Two weeks ago, our team lunch was supposed to be held at Lezzet, which I learned means delicious in Arabic from my Egyptian colleague. The day before, many colleagues were excited to go.   Well, Friday rolled around. My manager wasn't feeling great and pinged me in the morning. He wanted me to lead the lunch, which I have done before. Unfortunately, many couldn't go. The outing would have been me and an extremely talkative male colleague. I decided that I would sooner not go, as I didn't want to be lying in the restaurant in a comatose state hearing my colleague talk incessantly.   My manager apologized. I told him that it was okay. Instead, I went there after work and grabbed takeout for dinner that night.   It wasn't busy at 5:30 pm. I could have eaten there, but I wasn't all that hungry. There was a family of three ordering in front of me.   I ordered the Ali J's chicken shawarma on the rocks (rice) with special and garlic sauces. The regular size is huge! You can also go large.   I ate at home. I thought that I would leave half of it for lunch the following day. However, it was so delicious and addictive that I ate it all!  The rice is yummy. I don't know how to describe it, but it's fluffy and perfect, and complements the chicken shawarma nicely. The chicken shawarma is tender. You know that it's the real deal when you bite into it.   I loved the special and garlic sauces. The special sauce has hints of spicy heat. The garlic doesn't hit you until half an hour later. So good! Perhaps next time, I'll ask for hot sauce, too.   It was a great experience ordering from here. The restaurant is in a small plaza with plenty of parking, especially when Cora closes for the day at 3 pm.   (208)"}
{"text":"I came to this place because it had great reviews and it was recommended for their falafel.   It was super busy on a Friday at 2pm.  Unfortunately it was tasteless. The Falafel was tasteless and even the sauces were very bland. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Lezzet is a restaurant that you find because of the good reviews and you aren't disappointed after you eat a meal here.  We came on a Saturday around 6PM and the place was slow but still a couple of people in line. The service is excellent with 2-3 people behind the counter.  English is easily understood and spoken so no language barrier. There's a variety of different options and can be seen on the chalkboard overhead.  My boyfriend got the chicken shawarma and I got the pasta salad. The chicken shawarma was literally one of the best I've had in the GTA. The chicken was slowly spinning and the cooker and the charred taste of the chicken was phenomenal.  The vegetables were fresh and the shawarma sauce was delicious.  It was so good my boyfriend went back in line a second time to grab another one.  Consistent. The pasta salad was ok but the guy kept on putting his hand onto the plate and my salad was sliding into it. Ew.  100% would be bad. The prices were fair considering the quality. Will be back to try chicken on rocks next time."}
{"text":"I've been to this place at least 10 times so far, and the food never disappoints. I've only ordered Chicken Shawarma over Fries everytime I go, and it is always on point.  Fresh, lots of meat and good portion of their sauce.   I've read on Yelp that their service is horrible, and they park their car at handicap spot (lol), but I have never experienced bad service myself so will give them 5 for now!"}
{"text":"Been here more than a few times over the past 3 years. Only had the shawarma wraps, it's pretty good, better than most of the places I've eaten in downtown and the food is filling. The place is family run and they know their customers well."}
{"text":"Alright, so what can I say about Lezzet. Lezzet is located literally right in the corner of the plaza strip with a big sign above and 2 signs set outside the restaurant. You can't miss it. Warm atmosphere with some odd decor.  Going past that, the staff there are damn nice and engaging...in a good way. Great people to have a conversation with, and they also appear to be football (soccer) fans. So if you're down to debate if whether Barcelona or Real Madrid is better, you've come to the right place. They have a few TVs up and you can bet they will have the finals or the World Cup on.  Perhaps one of the best shawarma wraps I have eaten so far? And I've been to many shawarma joints, so a wrap this good is deeply suspect, no joke. I got their chicken shawarma wrap. Toppings are fresh, pita was nicely grilled, fair amount of delicious lean chicken, and that sauce...house made goodness. Not too saucy and not too dry. Like nothing I've tasted before.  Unfortunately I don't live that close to this place, otherwise you better bet I'd be there on a regular basis. So if you're ever around Dixie and Burhamthorpe area in Mississauga and are craving some delicious shawarma, I would highly recommend this place. Mmmm bella!"}
{"text":"My favourite Shawarma house! Food is amazing and customer service is second to none! Definitely the best shawarma in all of Mississauga! Maybe even the whole GTA."}
{"text":"Was craving something different for dinner. Friendly staff, asked if it was my first time there. I got the mixed chicken and beef platter with all 4 salads, humus, garlic sauce, shawarma sauce, hot sauce.  The meat was lean and well seasoned. Sauces were good with the hot sauce giving a bit of heat while not overpowering everything else.  It may have been my first visit but it won't be my last. I will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"I was actually looking for a different shawarma place but ended up here coincidentally. Was hungry so I tried the plate and ended up ordering another wrap ontop of it. This place is absolutely amazing and the owners are passionate and explain the origins and differences of meats.   Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"This by far is THE best shawarma place I've ever been to! I can't find a shawarma like that of Lezzets anywhere else!   I drive from Montreal to Toronto and you can bet every time I'm in Toronto I go to Lezzets! It is so worth the drive!   The food is scrumptious!! Not only is the meat perfectly cooked but ALL the food is just perfect ! They even have a wide variety of different delicious sauces!   The restaurant is well maintained, always very clean! The atmosphere is very positive, the staff are very kind and smiley! It's a very fun place to be there is amazing music playing that makes you want to dance a little but also at least I find ... you go in and eat your shawarma but then you always end up sitting and talking for like an hour! The staff are very appreciative and they work hard!   Keep it up Lezzets!! You are Z best !"}
{"text":"Great Shawarma!  It tastes yummy and fresh. Generous portions and good service."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for a Shawarma. I stopped in around lunch time since I had seen the spot had pretty good ratings and I was in the area. The staff was friendly. The shawarma itself was pretty good and easy to eat. As some have mentioned, not messy at all. They have a huge menu with lots of options. Perhaps if I were dinning in, I would order something more adventurous. Some things I noticed that they were missing for a Shawarma spot: no pickled beets (only regular pickles), no tabouli (pasta salad instead), only thick white onions (so beware of bad breath afterwards) and they charge extra $0.50 to add cabbage or another type of salad to the wrap. They also charge $1.00 extra for cheese if you want it. One plus is they have their own house sauce. I tried it and it's not too bad - kinda sweet if that's what you like. Another thing is they could spread the sauces more evenly as the house sauce and the hot sauce in my shawarma was all at the bottom of the wrap. I still recommend you give it a try. I will try them again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Quick, inexpensive, and delicious shawarma! I actually like this place better than Osmow's because of the variety on their menu.  For $10 - a meal here could be enough for lunch and dinner, seriously.  Most people take out but they do actually have quite a lot of tables to dine in! Ample parking as this is located in a plaza.  Will be back to try their kofta (as it's only offered Thurs - Sun).   Definitely agree that this is one of the top shawarma places in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"After seeing many positive reviews and driven by my inherent love for Mediterranean/middle eastern cuisine ,tried this restaurant. Loved the ambience and decor. It has sports bar kinda feel to it along with Mounted accolades posted across the walls. Coming to the main aspect: food. The freshness of the salad, chicken shawarma is commendable. We ordered the famed Ali G platter and the chicken shawarma platter. I personally preferred the chicken shawarma platter as it comes with couscous, chick pea salad, pasta , tahini ( I think) , rice  and pickled turnips all of these are yummy. The hot, garlic sauces they use are tangy . Ali G is just extra chicken over rice . The rice is unique , it has most likely turmeric in it and tastes great. Next time I want to try mixed shawarma in pita bread. I now have found my new favourite shawarma place in Mississauga(Safari grill was my go to shawarma place)."}
