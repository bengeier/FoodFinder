{"text":"I dream of Kanbai when I'm not there. It's really as good as it gets when it comes to authentic Szechuan in Montreal.  Every dish that I've sampled (and there have been many) was expertly seasoned, fresh, and memorable.  Be adventurous and have fun; you won't regret it. My recommendations:  Dry Fried Green Beans Fried Lotus Root Fish poached in red chili oil Cabbage and hot peppers Home style tofu fungus with coriander Salt and pepper shrimp Scampi Sizzling beef dish"}
{"text":"Been there numerous times. Its located on the basement level, but don't let that fool you into thinking it's not a decent place. The food is not extraordinary, but it's filling. Personal favourites is the jellyfish and cucumber salad, the noodles and the shrimps. The service is alright, nothing to rave about. Prices are decent.  L. John Dory Twitter: @LJohnDory"}
{"text":"I would review the food, but after waiting for over 45 minutes, it never came. We left this place and went to another restaurant a block away. 5 minutes after leaving KanBai, we were eating a freshly cooked chinese meal.   This restaurant takes over from the former Ichiban Ramen restaurant and even uses their old plates and cutlery, including bowls emblazoned with \"Ichiban\" on them. It wouldn't surprise me if this restaurant is as short lived as Ichiban.  It is a small restaurant and although there were two waitresses, it seems that they couldn't keep up. They took a long time taking our order and as mentioned above, our food never arrived. People who came after us got their orders taken before us and even people who ordered after us got their meals before us. Ours was a simple fried chicken dish that shouldn't have taken long to prepare. The couple seated next to us waited for about 20 minutes for someone to take their leftovers and to get the bill.  Big thumbs down for their charging of rice. $1.50 for a small portion? Better to go a two doors down to Pret a Manger or around the corner to Golden Stone.  I'm not going to bother with this place again."}
{"text":"I went there super excited, because I was waiting for a legit szechuan restaurant to open in montreal! expecting some taste of my childhood, but the food was really superficial, and not finely prepared and it was over saturated with sauce , cant even taste the real flavour of eggplant or tofu, and I felt like every dishes have been served with the same sauce thus all the dishes we ordered tasted like the same...:(( szechuan food does not mean all hot sauce all the way, it is a mixed cuisine of many tastes and often used the food's natural as base, and kanbai really missed out the key point of szechuan cuisine:( really dissapointing:( moreover the 3 times I went there, the waitress always had horrible attitude, the first time I just assume she was having a bad day or she was tired because it was a busy friday night, then I went again on a wednesday and thursday, and different waitress had the same bitchy attitude, despite us giving her a adequate tips (15%)truly dissapointing, would not recommend"}
{"text":"Food: For sure the menu offers a variety of Sichuan dishes and some variations from other regions. However, the typical Sichuan spices fragrance is missing, not spicy nor \"?\", everything toned down probably due to high amount of tourists in the area? Unfortunate of how misrepresented Sichuan food, with everything bathed in oil and starchy sauce. No no, Sichuan food unlike that, really~  Service: Euh... very... Chinese-like? - -\"  Price: Somewhat overpriced for the quality of the food  Ambiance: Yes clean Chinese restaurant, we like that~ Lots of lights and well spaced between tables, at least rest assured you will dine in a comfortable setting."}
{"text":"The best Sichuanese food in Montreal. Really authentic Chinese dishes, very spicy. So Caucasiens who are used to American-Chinese food should be careful because you may don't like it, and some are difficult for you to eat such as fish with bones, shrimps with shell."}
{"text":"Incredibly rude staff, food was too salty and the order was messed up. Really terrible place since they changed owner. Don't waste money, go to the one on Clark."}
{"text":"Hongfantian ( nom en mandarin)   Cuisine séchuannaise par excellence!  Service fort efficace, le garcon m'indiqua que mes choix, compe tenu que j'étais seul,  ne conviennaient pas car trop généreuxsi je ne pouvait en rapporter l'excédent.  J'ai donc opté pour:  Soupe aigre- douce Salade froide de méduse ( méduse, concombres, coriande et huile de sésame Boeufsauté  et piment fort Riz blanc  Accompagné d'une bière Tsingtao  L'endroit était bondé de clients asiatiques. Les quelques cIients/clientes nord- américains étaient accompagnés par des connaissances asiatiques.  L'endroit est très propre, bien éclairé et l'ambiance fort agréable.  Les plats furent à la hauteur de mes attentes, fort savoureux et servis chauds à l'exception de la salade froide de méduse, fort naturellement.  Endroit à retrouver  en groupe!"}
{"text":"I came back with someone so we could order more dishes...  We ordered chicken in hot pot, sauteed tofu house style, and dry fried pork. All dishes had bits of red peppers in them however, it wasn't too spicy.  the sauteed dish was very good, good sauce, onions, sea fungus and sliced peppers. With some rice it was simple and just like home.  The dry fried pork didn't have any bones in it but it had many pieces of cartilage, which made chewing a bit of a chore... the flavor was just salty enough to be felt after a few pieces, but being fried it does get a bit rich after a few pieces, I'd reorder only for 4 ppl, if you're 2 it will be hard to finish. We had to dip it in the tofu sauce to make it go down easier.  The chicken in clay pot, was put over a flame so it was scorching hot, we saw it start boiling so we turned of the fire. It was bits of leg meat, cut up into bite size. My partner does not eat meat with bones in it, so he didn't like it lol. I found the dish to be quite good. it wasn't too salty nor sweet, but it was drenched in the sauce which you could put on the rice, made more of a home style meal.  Most dishes are served family style, unadorned with no attempt at plating, not that kind of place. But chinese food is mostly family style... three four dishes, everyone with their own bowl of rice and digging in... you pick and choose which dishes to combine with the rice. OK I can now confirm, this is sichuan cuisine. Don't know if I love it yet but there's couple more dishes I want to try before I decide... :)"}
{"text":"Another KanBai!!! in chinatown this time.  It's located on clark where the now closed New dynasty used to be. Completely renovated, it is now the cleanest joint in chinatown, from the dining room to the toilets, it's all modern and clean.  The menu is similar to its sister restaurant KanBai on Ste-Satherine, szechuan cuisine with some Hunan and Cantonese thrown in there for good measure.  We ordered seven dishes for 6 ppl, and couldn't finish everything, comes out to 21$ per person and that's a damn good deal!!! plus I ate so well. I would say the chef here is better than at the Ste-cat location, same dishes better taste!!  We ordered shrimp, cabbage, calamari, tofu and eggplant, bamboo stew, fish in hot broth and beef soup.  The soup came out first, it's chopped beef in egg drop style soup, it's light and subtle, save some for later you will need it. Often the dishes wil be oily and sipping some soup on the side will help balance out the too much oil feeling.  The shrimp was very good, it's stir fried in soy sauce and sugar, and the sugar caramelizes the shrimps. It is shrimp with the shell on, so be warned. I like the shell on, gives it more flavor, but that's an acquired taste. The dish is on the sweet side, but with a bit of rice and soup it goes well.  The bamboo shoots are different, they are not the kind you get at the supermarket, and it comes in a mini wok over a flame so it's keeps warm, very good dish. The bamboo shoots are springy and woody so they are fun to chew, and the flavor is very well balanced, tasty.  Calamari and tofu eggplant are standard fare, still very good though, but the stand out discovery of the night was the cabbage!!! It's so simple I would never order this, but my friend did and boy am I glad he did. It's just cabbage stir fried with some salt, light brown sauce, and hot peppers, and some other secret powder ingredients. Eventhough it has peppers in the dish it's not spicy at all, and the cabbage looks plain stir fried but when you eat it, it is somehow infused with so much flavor.  I'm happy :)"}
{"text":"The dishes we tried were amazing and flavorful - mapo tofu, chinese vegetables, shrimp with lobster sauce and szechuan style beef hotpot dish. The portions were generous! Great experience!"}
{"text":"Most popular Sichuan dishes! As a Chinese, the dishes here really match what I crave. I'm a guy who needs to eat rice every day and this restaurant gives me so many choices. The service is fast and the price is reasonable. And I think almost every customer can get what they want from Chinese cuisine. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"I tried fried chicken & fried fish in hot sauce. It was delicious but kind of too salty for certain ppl. Anyway I would like to try other menus in Kan bai."}
{"text":"Bof, la qualité de la nourriture  est de plus en plus pas bon sûrement dû au changements de chef. Les ingrédients ne sont pas frais du TOUT. Nous avons commandé une casserole avec supposément un mélange de légume, viande et fruit de mer. LE résultat final a été 3-4 crevettes ,3-4 morceaux de pomme de terre et LE reste cest juste des choux."}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer here, because the food is quite good. But maybe not anymore.  But the tableware needs major improvements, both on the dishware themselves and the maintenance of them.  1) A lot of the dishes and cups are rusted. Literally, rust particles float around the water cup. And the dishes are so rusted away that I was afraid to put any food in it.  2) Most of their tableware are enamel-based. The cups/dishes were rusted probably because the enamel layer was taken off/broken/ melted away or whatever during the heavy commercial use. That's fine if they swiftly replace them with new ones. But they aren't doing so.  It's well known that damaged enamel-based dishes release heavy metal elements, such as lead, based on what they're  made of (it's usually some kind of metal). They are potentially carcinogenic, and also cause Alzheimer's and dementia.   And at this stage , it's obvious that  their cups and dishes are so heavily damaged to the point of being rusty. You don't want to ruin your good food with such terrible dishware.  3) The cups and dishes were filthy. I was horrified to see such a lot of dried food particles stuck on the dishes.  And what made me write this review? I mentioned all these to the cashier and what I heard was:  \"So what? That's the way it is\". With a shrug.  Well ok, you just lost a regular customer."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious. Fried rice is  the best I have ever had. Service is excellent as well. Highly recommend this place. Space is small but clean. Price is affordable."}
{"text":"Not fully authentic Sichuan cuisine, maybe a lighter version of it.  You have food from other regions of China and maybe a few fusion dishes.  But the food was great, everything tasted very good.  The first thing that caught our attention was how nice the waiter was, extremely friendly service, not typical for Chinese restaurant.  Toronto has some of the best Chinese restaurants in North America, this one can definitely survive if it were operating in Toronto.  Next time I'm visiting Montreal and are craving for Chinese food, I know where to go!  The tofu in bamboo container was really great."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed in this place - I used to come here occasionally for Chinese food, and while the service wasn't amazing, it wasn't terrible either.  However, my recent experience at Kan Bai really left me without words. For an event, we ordered 15 orders of a dish, and specified the time range that we would be picking it up. We even left a deposit of $60 ( the total was $150) the day before. However, when I went to pick it up the next day, they forgot our order, which I would've understood if they seemed apologetic. However, not only did they not apologize, they even suggested that it was my fault for not calling and reminding them the day of. If I already left a deposit at the restaurant the day before, I would expect the restaurant to remember and make the order on time. I asked to cancel the order, because the waitress said it would take 20-30 minutes to make the order, and I was already running late. I thought it was a reasonable request, since the kitchen had not even started making the order yet. However, the waitress made it sound very unreasonable and had a very condescending attitude. Because I was speaking with her in English, I guess she thought I didn't understand Chinese, so she was even talking about me in Chinese with her coworker, right in front of me!   I am so disappointed by the service of this place. While the food may be decent, it doesn't make up for the rude and horrible service."}
{"text":"After living in China for 6 years, I never thought I would find authentic Chinese food once back in MTL. Kanbai is my home away from home:) try the Fish dish they are famous for, egg and tomatoes, sweet and sour pork ribs and any eggplant dish. Delicious."}
{"text":"Decent sichuanese/chinese food in chinatown. Pretty good for mtl standards. Fairly friendly waiters"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Szechuan in the city. Although the one in chinatown is slightly better in my opinion (bigger portions but slightly more expensive) I love the Szechuan Cabbage and lamb on sizzling Iron plate. Great dishes! Other highlights are the green beans with minced pork, and poached fish or poached beef in hot chilli oil. Service is fast as well. A must try if you enjoy Szechuan food!"}
{"text":"My go to for Szechuan in Montreal. Used to be the other location on Ste Catherine but its not as good lately since they changed ownership plus this locations portions are WAY bigger but slightly more expensive. Favorite dishes are  -Szechuan Cabbage -Spicy Lamb on sizzling Iron Plate -Green Beans with minced pork You cant go wrong with any of those dishes."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered are pretty tasty! Especially mapo tofu and intestines, so good!! We will come back soon!"}
{"text":"So delicious and so real Chinese food!!! I'm grateful that we found a such good Chinese restaurant in Montreal.  They offer Sichuan, Cantonese, and Hunan cuisines. I've been here so many times and I must say each dish was very tasty and yummy!  Oh, btw, this location was another restaurant called \"new dynasty\"; Now \"Kanbai\" take the place and did a renovation. It's very clean and beautiful now. And I have to say: foods in Kanbai are much better than New Dynasty!!!"}
{"text":"This place is way better then the Kanbai located near Concordia.  The food is excellent, well prepared, and perfectly seasoned. I would like to point out that for the numerous times I've had the pleasure to dine here, the food was consistently that good and tasted great. For a Sichuanese restaurant, consistency is something extremely important yet so often undervalued.  The Yuxiang Eggplant is truly amazing here, the eggplants are not soggy, full of flavors, and the amount of sauce is just right. The Sichuan Boiled Fish is also extremely delicious, the visual presentation is stunningly beautiful: huge pot filled with spicy soup, topped with a handful of dry chili peppers.  The restaurant offers some Cantonese dishes as well, but the stars are really the spicy goodness. You don't come to this place to eat General Tao, you're here because you want to excite your pallets!  The interior decor is really nice, the place is neat and clean, but not spacey enough to accommodate the large volume of diners it gets every night.  I only have two issues with this restaurant:  1. It does not accept Credit Cards. 2. The waiters just sort of ignore you during dinner service; I get it, it's a busy place with lots of hungry diners, but that's not a valid excuse."}
{"text":"Kanbai means cheers in Taiwanese and you'll find lots of Spicy food and drink here!  This Taiwanese shop serves up some great dishes of lamb, pork and or beef with some pretty savoury ingredients.  We tried their spicy chili noodle soup and the beef and eggplant on an iron hot plate. The noodle soup was REALLY spicy and tasty. If you can handle the hot stuff, try it.  The beef/eggplant dish was filling and went well with a bowl of rice (extra).  Very authentic, good portions and service!  I would recommend coming here for dinner instead with a good group of friends, as traditionally it normal to eat this food with lots of beer! Kanbai!"}
{"text":"J'ai adoré mon expérience. J'ai commandé une spécialité de la maison: les intestins de cochons avec un à côté de riz. C'est vraiment excellent, savoureux et relevé à souhait. Le service est courtois et amusant, c'est toujours un plaisir de venir souper dans ce resto."}
{"text":"The Sichuan eggplant was not good: sweet, one-dimensional.  The sliced fish poached in oil, a great dish usually, was OK, but I did not detect any Sichuan peppercorns, and it was not spicy enough. Other dishes were between mediocre and good.  Service was friendly and attentive.  There are several other better Sichuan options in Montreal."}
{"text":"If you like spicy chinese food with a color so red it looks evil, this is a place to try. They have this huge spicy fish pot filled with other ingredients such mushrooms, tofu noodles, etc.   My main issue however is the price. Depending on how big the pot is and if you want to add seafood or not, the pot can easily add up to 100$. However, it's a decent size to share with others so in the end it isn't that bad.   As for the staff, it's definitely not one of the best services in town. The tables and chairs feel a bit sticky when touching it.   Would recommend for the food, but not the ambiance or the service."}
{"text":"If you like spicy, this is the place for you. If you're scared of spicy food, well this is also the place for you.   Their menu has a huge variety of yummy food, spicy and non spicy. So this place is perfect if you like noodles, chicken, beef, spicy, seafood, and the list goes on and on.   The service is super quick. The food arrives after blinking a few times. We always got served by the same waiter and hes very nice and funny.   For a restaurant in chinatown, this place is so damn clean.   So yes, do try it here."}
{"text":"We pretty much always order the same thing when we come here, and it's always good. Super consistent (and quite spicy!). The menu is pretty long and some of the descriptions are not very descriptive, which is maybe why we rarely deviate from what we know and love: #631, which is a silky smooth tofu hotpot with eggplant; #404, a spicy fish soup with soybean sprouts (and maybe their most popular dish---everyone seems to get it); and #306, which is a pork rib hotpot with peppers that is partially cooked at the table. And, of course, we have some beer in a futile attempt to cool down. It's not food that is super hot on the tongue---it just heats you up all over. The last time we went, my husband turned to me and said, \"The front of my knees are sweating.\" Ha! In any case, we get a hankering for Kan Bai about once a month. The grub is delicious and quite addictive."}
{"text":"The service is horrible!!! I called the restaurant to reserve a table, and the waitress told us, they only accept walk-in clients which is ok. So, In order to make sure the seat is available, I called 2times before arrived.(one is before 20mins, and another one is before 5mins)and they promised that there are available table. When we arrived, they said we have to wait about at least 25mins, and there are absolute 3 tables have been reserved!!! My question is why you lie?! and waiters' attitude were super bad and rude!! OMG!!Such a bad experience!!"}
{"text":"It's one of my favourite Asian restaurants. A friend who lived in Shanghai for 10 years introduced me to this place. Meals are flavourful, spicy, sweet, sour... You get it, packed with divine Asian flavour! Some of the foods may be greasy, but nothing that takes away from the taste! Interior decor is chic and it's a good place to bring groups as sharing meals is the way to go. Last time, we shared a meal with a group of omnivores and vegetarians; everyone was happy about how good the food was. Price is fair for the quantity and variety of the food. I go there every year."}
{"text":"Meilleur restaurant chinois du Québec, Il faut savoir choisir dans le menu car certaies plas seront déjà vue et d'autres plus authentiques: Mes recos: Canard ou intenstin dans une plats grésillant. Mapo tofu. poulet Kung Pao (un gros classique de la cuisine chinoise si vous connaissez pas..) sinon la soupe de poisson aux piments. les riz frits, le lotus frit."}
{"text":"J'aime bien ce resto. Le rapport Quantité/Prix y ait. J'adore leur général Tao, il est épicé avec des épices qu'on ne connait pas toujours dans la bouche tout en restant épicé. Il peut accueillir de gros groupes.   Le menu est très varié et le staff parle très bien anglais et français. Je trouves cela plate par contre qu'ils n'offrent pas de menu midi ou combo."}
{"text":"I have trouble believing the negative reviews on here. I think to start they are reviewing the sister location in China Town.  This place is the bees knees. Honestly they have never let me down. The service is super fast, very friendly and very attentive. I'm always unhorsed with how consistently my water is refilled and how fast the food is to the table.   The food is not over salted and packed with so much flavor. We EMT the other day as a group and ordered probably 15 dishes and each one was delicious and unique. I recommend the chili chicken if you like a fried chicken, the eggplant, the green beans, the shrimp.. All of it so so good.  Couldn't recommend this place more."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese restaurant in Montreal. Excellent taste, authentic and decently priced. One of my favorite."}
{"text":"Un peu orphelin dans ce bout de la rue Clark dans le quartier chinois de Montreal ce restaurant classique ne vous attirera pas par son extérieur qui ne paie pas de mine. Bienvenue en Chine. Le restaurant KanBai a une double personnalité. Le midi c'est le rendez-vous de dizaines d'employés de bureau et de fonctionnaires qui ont ont fait leur cantine. On y trouve une douzaine de plats chinois classiques tels le General Tao, les nouilles Singapour, le poulet Kung Pao ou mon préféré le porc piquant. Ces plats sont servis avec une soupe aigre et piquante et un petit rouleau de printemps en entrée et du riz et un petit légume en accompagnement. Le tout très souvent servi en même temps. Tous les plats arrivent très chauds, sont délicieux et coûtent 7.50$ donc avec taxes et pourboire on est à 10$. Le soir c'est une toute autre foule qui vient s'y retrouver. Des jeunes, des couples, des familles complètes chinoises qui commandent autant de plats qu'il y a de convives et tout le monde se sert avec plaisir sur le grand plateau rotatif qui orne le centre des plus grandes tables. Le menu propose tous les plats de la cuisine chinoise classique que l'on peut imaginer. Le bonheur réside dans la découverte et comme les plats coûtent autour de 12$ pourquoi s'en priver. C'est bruyant, buzzant et charmant. Le service est souriant, le français approximatif, les factures aimables. On y retourne parce que c'est la Chine."}
{"text":"What a delight find in the mid of downtown Montreal. This place served some very authentic sichuan dishes that is done the right way. Everything we ordered were absolutely delicious, plus this place is pretty inexpensive and the service was very prompt. Its got all the check boxes to qualify 5 stars for me! The dishes we ordered were Lamb served on a sizzling iron plate, Mopu Tofo, Twice cooked pork, shrimp noodles, spicy pork and pepper served in hot casserole. We loved everything that we got, which is really rare for a food critic like me. If you are into authentic sichuan style dishes, definitely give this place a shot."}
{"text":"The best Chinese restaurant in the area ( but not the best Asian restaurant lol), the  place is classier then most and the food is quite good for the price. Can't get enough of the Kung pao chicken!!!"}
{"text":"Try the FISH fillet in Chili (&Chili Oil)Broth. It's delicious! Large bowl and affordable! (14$) fish is super good and melts in your mouth, exploding with flavor.  Also tried the pork with green pepper, i love the added dried chilis in the dishes, super tasty. Surprisingly not too spicy . I'm can't really handle eating spicy food but these dishes full of chili were perfect. It may look spicy so ask if you want it spicy. All but good things!"}
{"text":"This place makes GREAT General Tao Chicken. It's honestly some of the best I've ever had. Sweet and tangy and sort of crunchy/soft.   I came in with my parents after a long day of Christmas Shopping and we were ravenous. We ordered one meal each. (We also got pork and lamb but I forgot the names of the dishes:( ) Service was super fast, the food was served within 15-20 minutes of us placing the order. The portions are also really big. 3 meals and a medium sized bowl of rice and we were done for. We barely finished everything.   It's a super low key place, I always walk by it when I'm at school and sometimes I forget it's there. The restaurant is down a flight of stairs and the exterior is really faded and looks like a store.  The one weird thing is they used to have a huge menu but recently they've crossed out a bunch of options so the menu is very scribbled on and it's hard to tell what's being served and what isn't."}
{"text":"Food is not good....can not compare with kanbai in chinatown...service is ok.....but they always don't give the bill legal to customer.....and they charge you the tax with the illegal bill.......be carefull....revenu Quebec coming soon!!!"}
{"text":"My 2nd time here and again enjoyed a lot. So, they serve really good Chinese food in town. Almost everything is available. I ordered stir fried vegetables with shrimps on. And that was so delicious. Full of Chinese people also shows that this is a good place to have dinner. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"La bouffe d'ici est plus en plus po bonne!peut etre a cause le propriete a change...et le service est comme si comme ca...les serveurs qui parlent meme po en francais..la toillet est po propre non plus...."}
{"text":"Un peu plus près de la Chine!  Voilà l'impression que j'ai eu hier soir en partageant un repas de fin de soirée ici (après avoir vu l'excellent \"Prometheus\" en IMAX 3D) avec mon épouse. Celle-ci avait lu une critique favorable dans \"La Presse\" alors on a tenté notre chance, malgré une critique très négative sur Yelp.  Grand bien nous en fît! Les portions ici sont très généreuses et il convient de partager les plats. Nous avons partagé simplement une grande soupe aigre et piquante, un plat de poulet au poivre et cumin et un plat de riz blanc moyen. Pour deux, la soupe et le riz étaient trop grand, une petite soupe et un petit riz (à deux!) nous auraient suffit largement!  Le plat qui m'a réellement rappeler la Chine est le \"poulet au poivre et cumin\". Des morceaux succulents de poulet (couper avec les os comme en Chine) servi sur un lit d'arachides et d'épices. Relevé mais sans excès.  Si vous préférez les restos chinois conventionnels, ce n'est pas pour vous. Si vous voulez vous sentir un peu plus près de la Chine, alors cette adresse de Ste-Catherine Ouest représente le bon choix!"}
{"text":"A pot of Jasmine tea was brought to us after being seated - a good start. We ordered fried rice, chicken with black bean sauce, and bok choy.  It was surprisingly delicious and the portions, huge.  My only complaint was that bok choy could have been prepared better by removing the ends or perhaps cooked a tad longer, but that didn't stop me from eating every last one.  Overall, I enjoyed this meal very much and would return."}
{"text":"We ordered Kung Pow Shrimps, chicken fried rice, beef satay, shrimp wonton soup and sweet and sour soup. Everything was really good, except the kung pow shrimp sauce was too sweet. I especially liked their wontons, it was packed with shrimp patties and was actually filling unlike measly wontons you usually get at other Chinese places.   Food also came out super fast even though it seemed fairly busy. And the waitress was really nice, she made friendly conversations and checked on us every now and then."}
{"text":"Came here by fluke,were actually looking for another place.Attractive looking place,service very quick,efficient,and happy to see you out just as quickly and efficiently. We were a party of 2,ordered the General Tao chicken,and the beef ribs in honey sauce,along with vegetable fried rice and a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon. A pot of tea arrived lickety split,followed by the wine,and then our dishes.The General Tao was standard,the beef ribs in honey sauce,little better than rubber erasers in some nonhoney sauce.The vegetable fried rice...standard as well. We hadn't even finished our meal and the waitress was already clearing our table! What,they were expecting some VIPS,party of a few hundred perhaps?? Better to check out other restos in the area,much better food with same or better prices,and no one eager to see you go."}
{"text":"I always go to Kanbai when Im craving sichuan food and I've always thought it was decent until I had sichuan food in toronto... In comparison, Kanbai tasted like americanized sichuan food, the food lacked spices and depth of flavour that is intrinsic in sichuan food: everything seemed like it was toned down: the flavours, the variety of ingredients, etc. However, I have yet to find somewhere authentic in Montreal so I must say that I will be back.   Out of all the dishes, I recommend the fried green beans, the fish sauce eggplants and the fish boiled in hot oil."}
{"text":"Since February I've been mourning the loss of my favorite restaurant in Chinatown (New Dynasty, anyone?). Hence, I'm looking for a new place.   My friend really, really wanted to try this place because of their super spicy chili noodle soup. I saw they had salt & pepper shrimps so I agreed to go.   The place is small and it can get quite loud. The decor is modern and very nice. Our waitress was probably a McGill or Concordia student because she didn't speak any French. The menu was big, but a few things were marked with liquid paper.   Our food came quite fast. My friend's soup was HUGE. I dipped my chopsticks in it to taste it and it is very very spicy. Too much for me, but she liked it. She wasn't able to eat it all and she was able to take it to go. The put the liquid in one bowl and the rest of the soup in the other. Smart move.   My salt & pepper shrimps were fried with the shell, which I had never seen before. The people next to us saw how confused I was and they told me I could eat the shell (A Vietnamese friend of mine later confirmed that this is how they eat shrimp). I ate a couple and it was fine, but then I got a little sick of it.   When the bill came, it was $17 for both of us. They didn't make 2 bills, so we had to split 50-50 when we paid and then my friend paid me back a few dollars.   If I do go back, I'll ask for the shrimps without the shell. I'm always up for trying new cultural foods, but shrimps with the shell, I just can't."}
{"text":"This restaurant is here for many years. I went there before, but I heard they have new dish?fresh grilled fish. So I tried this new dish. The dish size is depend on how many people eat. We ordered one for 4 people, around $60. The fish is fresh and taste good. But it's very salty, the side dishes are too salty to eat. And the fish is so small, not worth the price."}
{"text":"Tried their spicy fish filet soup, cabbage, fried chicken and lamb dishes. Overall, flavor profiles were decent but I wanted more complexity from the chill peppers. Still a good experience!"}
{"text":"This is my Go-To Chinese place in Montreal. I was a huge fan of the previous restaurant in this location, New Dynasty, and I was told much of the kitchen staff had stayed when the restaurant changed hands. Indeed, many menu items remain the same -- albeit some have undergone minor changes. As others have mentioned, its renovated and very clean, and is a bit more upscale as far as Montreal Chinatown restaurants go; definitely  someplace you can go out to for a nice dinner.   The food is fantastic. There's really nothing else to say about it. Everything has always been fresh and tasty.   Service has been good when I've eaten there although I frequently get takeout.   A bit pricier than other options, but really worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered a takeout for beef chow fun and kong pao chicken, they served the chow fun without noddle and chicken without rice! Very first time I had experienced such a bad service."}

The folks who work here will seat you seriously and then give you a little smile and gently fill your beer glasses as you down the kirin or tsingtsao, and they will even crack jokes quietly about how spicy it is and how much food you're ordering if you get a little friendly report going with them.   Last night we ordered: the spicy red pepper fish filet (which previously I ate with people who like me thought this was a soup and wondered why my eyes were weeping hot oil and my insides crying. Turns out it's not so much a soup: eat the fish and mushrooms and peppers out of the oil, don't drink it unless you like weeping burning oil tears and lighting on fire from the inside. Either way it's freaking delicious.) We also ordered the house fried rice, the spicy cabbage, and the eggplant with minced pork. This was a perfect amount of food for 4 people and with beers and tip was close to $100 total so that's nice.   The restaurant is tucked up on a dim block of Clarke, around the corner from the pretty lights of the heart of our small Chinatown. It's up a few steps, it's a warm nicely decorated room in red and black and gold with one big window, clean and comfortable and an excellent way to (h)eat up the winter."}
{"text":"The cumin lamb was good, as cumin lamb universally is.  Food portions were quite generous and the tea came served in an interesting pot.  It may take a while to get someone's attention so you have to be ready to be aggressive, be super patient, or be ready to walk out.  The house-style sauteed tofu really brought it home for us, quite enjoyed the taste and flavor profile.    Not the best sichuan food I've had (I've had a lot), but certainly a nice change and good addition to the local chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"We were looking for a restaurant to celebrate the year end.  There were over 20 of us, and our budget was only $400 (i.e. less than $20 per person).  With this budget, all other restaurants we enquired at could only give us something really simple and  unimpressive.  Eg, a bento set from a Japanese restaurant or a pasta from a western restaurant.  Then we found Kanbai.  Food here is good.  We had two tables and ordered about 8 dishes for each table.  The total bill was below $400 (excl taxes and tips).  Memorable dishes included the Water-cooked Fish (a numbing-spicy dish), deep-fried garlic Shishamo fish, the Ma-Po Toufu, roasted duck, eggplant, four-seasons beans etc.  There was even some food for us to doggy-bag.  Service is as you would expect in such a restaurant - pretty efficient though harried servers (and hence don't expect small talk or niceties from them).  Can't complain, really.  Ambience is above average.  It is new, and clean.  However when it is crowded, it gets really echo-ey.... something to do with its acoustics.    My main peeve, if I have to name one, is that the floor tiles are extraordinarily slippery when wet.   We came after a snow fall, and like other customers we were trailing snow into the restaurant, and slipping.  Think ice.  Indeed, would be hazardous for older folks.  For a Montreal restaurant at street level, I should think they ought to have the common sense to choose floor tiles that afford better traction even when wet."}
{"text":"I am a Kan Bai regular customer. I have tried many Chinese restaurants in Montreal and Toronto in the past years. I have to say, their food is at least the same level or some times even better than the top ones in both city. Their menu is improving as well as their service. Their Fish filets in hot chili oil is delicious! Kungpao Chicken is a must try too."}
{"text":"Nous avons dîné ici avec des collègues de mon chum (nous étions 5 en tout).  Ils ont tous les 3 choisi un plat parmi le menu midi, mais mon chum et moi voulions quelque chose de moins classique. Il y a beaucoup de choix sur le menu, et les plats sont classés par type de viande. Après avoir hésité pendant 10 bonnes minutes, nous avons finalement choisi l'agneau épicé (#301 si mes souvenirs sont bons), accompagné d'un petit bol de riz (il faut commander le riz à part). Pour les plus téméraires, j'ai vu qu'ils servaient de la méduse!  Le restaurant était relativement plein mais nous avons été servis très rapidement et nous avons donc pu savourer notre repas sans se presser.  Notre agneau était absolument délicieux. J'avais peur que ce soit trop épicé mais c'était juste assez relevé. Les portions sont vraiment généreuses pour le prix, j'ai même eu du mal à finir mon assiette, mais pas question d'en laisser une miette!  Le personnel est serviable et efficace, que ce soit au moment de prendre les commandes, vous servir et vous apporter votre facture. Ils ne parlent pas français mais ce n'est pas vraiment gênant, au pire des cas les plats sont désignés par des numéros (comme dans de nombreux restaurants asiatiques).  C'est une place un peu bruyante, mais la nourriture est délicieuse et très abordable. Un vrai bijou!"}
{"text":"We waited 1 hour for the food. The food is too salty and hard. And one thing the restaurant is probably a knock off of the one with the same name on Clark street. So I recommend go there instead."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times. Best szechuanese food in town!"}
{"text":"KanBai is an authentic Chinese restaurant located in Chinatown. We ordered General Tao Chicken, Fried Pig Intestine and Sour Pickled Fish Soup.  Food: I think the food could be better. It met my expectations but my taste buds weren't overly excited. If you are down to try the pig intestine - do it! It was my favourite dish of the night. The soup sizes are generous and I was surprised we finished the huge bowl of Sour Pickled Fish Soup. Their spice level on their dishes is up there so if you can't handle the spice - ask for less spice.  Price: We went in a party of two and it only costed $50 for two. We had 3 full dishes and a rice. I even had packed the left overs away and plan to bring it to work tomorrow. Apparently the portions were bigger than the KanBai in downtown St Catherine's.  Ambience: It was similar to other Chinese restaurants within Chinatown and there wasn't anything spectacular. However, I enjoyed the overall cleanliness. I also feel that the location is quite specious so it would be perfect for bigger groups and parties."}
{"text":"Now called \"Little Pink Fish\", this branch of the Kanbai chain is a must stop for Chinese food in downtown Montreal. Their signature grilled fish hotpot is the one thing that all my friends from out of town keep coming back to try. Available in a variety of flavours and broths, you can choose to have pork ribs, seafood and even lobster into your pot. The pot ranges from small to medium to large. The large one serves around 8-10 people and is definitely one of the largest dishes I have ever had in Canada. Around dinner time there is usually some kind of wait, so if you can, come a bit early to avoid lining up!"}
{"text":"WOW ! J'adore ce sympathique resto qui offre un mélange un peu déroutant de cuisine Chinoise et Taïwanaise. Oubliez ce que vous connaissez des restos chinois traditionnels du Québec. KanBai n'est pas l'endroit à vous servir du général Tao, du poulet à l'ananas ou de la soupe Wong Tong. Oubliez ça ! Kan Bai, c'est de l'exotisme pur. Un secret caché sur la rue St-Catherine.  Dès le début, j'ai été impressionné par la diversité des plats offerts au menu. Il y a tellement de choix que c'est presque un casse-tête de se faire une idée. Ici, on couvre tout de la cuisine de l'Asie du Sud-Est. Donc place à des plats qui risquent de déstabiliser (sinon, de carrément vous faire vous faire peur) comme l'estomac de vache, le ragout au tripes de cochon, les joues de poissons au poivre et la salade de méduse.   Pour ma part, j'ai choisi un poisson mariné dans un bouillon épicée. Très épicée (voir la photo). La personne qui m'accompagnait avait choisi un surprenant et savoureux plat de canard dans un petit chaudron fumant. J'y ai gouté. Le canard était vraiment tendre. Un délice. Si vous hésitez, demandez conseil à votre serveuse. C'est ce que j'ai fait.   Les prix sont très respectables en raison de la qualité offerte. Le français des serveuses est limité, mais elles font l'effort quand-même de vous servir dans la langue de votre choix, en incluant bien-sûr le cantonnai."}
{"text":"I found out about this restaurant after reading nice reviews and decided to try. I've been here 3 times and I was never disappointed. The food is simply delicious! The service is really fast and I would just keep coming back for the amazing eggplantes with pork. It's also nice to notice how we are always surrounded by Chinese customers and how much they appreciate this restaurant,  which is outside Chinatown. Fair price, good food. This place is a must try."}
{"text":"very decent Chinese spicy food. I recommend the spicy deep fried chicken. I also like the lotus root, fried one and the juicy one."}
{"text":"We drive from New York in a very cold weather. The spicy food here is prefect for the cold weather. We like spicy fish pot and spicy cold noodle in this place!"}
{"text":"If you love SPICE and HEAT as much as I do, then you can't go wrong here.  I came here last night for dinner and the place was jam-packed with a line-up of awaiting customers. Practically all of them were Asian. Now, don't get me wrong, but I find it's the people who come from a specific part of the world or culture who know the best food from that same part of the world or culture.  In other words, follow the locals. If I want to know the best Greek taverna to eat at in Patmos, I'm going to ask a local person from Patmos who has lived there their whole life, not look things up in \"Lonely Planet\". Likewise, if you want good Taiwanese, ask someone from Taiwan or watch where local Taiwanese expats go to chow down.  If red chillies scare you, don't come here. If on the other hand, breaking out into a sweat while a multitude of amazing flavours dance on your tongue doesn't faze you in the least, then you'll enjoy yourself here.  We ordered the chicken with chillies, green beans with pork and garlic and the sizzling lamb. All of it was outstanding and the green beans in particular were very, very addictive and  a dish I wish I knew how to make at home.  Service is very, very brisk and terse but polite and if you have issues sitting close to other people, you may not enjoy the experience here. However, if watching controlled chaos intrigues you, then you're in for a treat."}
{"text":"Sometimes some affordable and delicious Chinese food is what I need even when I am travelling.  Wandering around China Town looking for food and Kan Bai nice deco looks promising and the food is quite decent too!  We had the Bamboo Shoot and the Whole Fish in Soy bean sauce both are reasonably priced and portion is perfect to share between 2 people.  Both dishes have enough spicy and flavour without being overwhelming.   Kan Bai is a great option if you have craving just like me for some Northern Chinese food in Montreal."}
{"text":"The sizzling lamb dish is great! Along with some of the items we had, the food was really delicious. The service here could be better, and the delay between being seated and being served, even water, was somewhat irritating (servers would pass by, but ignore us completely)."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese dish. Serving the food fast, humorous waiter, nice environment. The spicy fish filet ? well, Shui-Zhu-Yu, is my favorite. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love discovering new cool places. We got to this place be accident (everything else we tried was closed). If your are looking for a cheap fast food prices this is not the place for you (restaurant prices 8-12 $ per dish), but if you are looking for an experience and good food you have arrived. The place was packed with locals (99% Asians, and in a Chinese restaurant this is always a good sign) so we knew its going to be good. I would advise you to skip on the cucumber salad (not that unique) but the eggplant dishes were amazing and I loved the Lotus roots dish. Great food, a little oily, a little spicy but trust me  you will leave satisfy."}
{"text":"Je suis allée avec mon copain,  c'était ma deuxième visite et j'ai adoré !  Encore un super service , tous sont très courtois et souriants ! Nourriture très bonne et service rapide !  J'y retourne avec plaisir :)"}
{"text":"This is without a doubt my favourite Chinese/Taiwanese in town. Straight forward cuisine, executed consistently and to perfection. One warning, their spicy is SPICY.  Specials on the wall, and Chinese Idol playing on the TVs the vibe is amazing. I highly recommend the spicy cumin lamb, and the eggplant dishes.   Every diner is brought a tiny amuse bouche of peanuts and soybean, even this start is amazingly tasty. But this is just a start, the large menu is full of variety. Often on weekend mornings you'll see the staff cutting hot chilies, take this as a warning, and a sign. Eat spicy. Order with a bowl of rice for authenticity, and to help cut the heat. The portions are quite generous, one plate easily feeds a single person, but it's best, and meant to be, served family style. Bring a friend or two, and order several plates and share.  The waitstaff is friendly, and knowledgeable, they'll happily recommend something to suit your taste and mood, the prices are affordable, and the quality is always top notch. In short, a must visit for asian cuisine."}
{"text":"What I love about this restaurant is how every dish tastes amazing. I've yet to try one that makes me not want to finish my meal. In addition to that, the service is very friendly with a staff that are likeable and funny. The wait for the dishes is not long at all, too.   I knock a point because the menu presentation and interior of the restaurant is not among the best I've seen."}
{"text":"There is nothing more satisfying than having a craving for a particular treat, going someplace on a whim and having the dish perfectly prepared at a reasonable price.  This is exactly what I experienced tonight at KanBai.  I came to Montreal specifically looking for lobster, chinese style.  I was staying around the corner and this was literally the first place I came across.  It was early on a Tuesday night - just barely 5PM, but there were a couple of tables occupied already.  Once I saw they had several lobster dishes on the menu (at Market Price), I agreed to be seated.  I had to decide between steamed lobster with ginger and scallion or lobster with spicy chili pepper sauce.  For a moment, I considered asking for it done with black bean sauce, since I wasn't sure about the chili sauce and it's hard to go wrong with Black Bean Sauce.  Happily, I went with my gut and ordered the Lobster in Chili Sauce, which the waitress said was 22$.  As anyone who has been in these \"big table\" family style Chinese restaurants knows, the portions are usually large and made to share, so I refrained from ordering anything else besides tea (comes with anyways) and a small bowl of rice.  The lobster was PERFECT.  It was, I imagine, quickly deep fried because many of the parts that would normally be inedible were rendered bits of crunchy deliciousness.  The sauce was a mouthwatering blend of salt, whole peppercorns, scallions and dried red peppers - lots of them!  I tasted a bit of sweet, but not too much.  Overall, there were several really well balanced complimentary flavors.  The lobster was succulent, lots of meat in the claws, body and of course tail - and it was split in all the right places to make getting the meat out that much easier.  The sauce was so tasty I found myself wanting to eat the head and tail as well, which I have never done before, but happily did tonight.  Finally, I understand the Chinese concept of nose to tail (or perhaps antenna to back fin in this case) dining.  I simply couldn't get enough of this dish.  My only regret was that I didn't have friends to share and ooh and ahh over it with.  If you're a lobster fan, head on down and order this dish.  Don't worry - even though it's a chili pepper sauce, it's not that spicy.  It's just spicy enough to pop that flavor up a notch.  The peppercorns were a tasty surprise and definitely added a lot to this dish.  It seemed like an excellent value for a really high quality meal served in a nice setting.  They DO take Visa - just not MC or Amex for some reason."}
{"text":"So we were told about this restaurant from the boss of \"New Dynasty\" who used to occupy this location. As the previous person wrote probably the cleanest place in china town. But can this be the place I have been looking for in montreal. A real szechuan place. none of this General tao crap....Looking at the menu at the window what do I see??? General Tao!!!! But thanx to some chinese people leaving they told me it was good. So I said why not.... I ordered the potato strips, Szechuan noodles, cumin lamb and spicey chicken(No bones).  Noodles and Patatos come first.....OMG its the real think I said. It was awesome. First time ever I eat this in Montreal...then the lamb comes...home run again. Awesome...I am waiting for the climax, my favorite dish which I even asked the waiter iis it like china. Just as I was to climax from the food the walls came crashing down when the dish arrived, this was not like china but a General tao version of my LaGiJi.... I complained but he told me I should have ordered with the bones. There was a miscommunication over this dish. Do not order no bones..... I still gave a 4 star as everything else was good. I will be back to try the chicken with the bones and I will rate again."}
{"text":"Four stars *relative to other Montreal Chinese restaurants*  Poached fish is excellent. String beans and twice-cooked pork are okay. Pickled vegetable fish isn't very good.  Overall okay, not amazing but passable, unlike most Chinese places in Montreal."}
{"text":"We love getting take out from this place!  I have to say they are very authentic and the food is not over sauced and salted like a lot of other restaurants.  Our favourite dishes are the fish sauce eggplant and the cumin lamb.  I have to say that they are a must try if you like eggplant and lamb.    We are definitely going to go there again or do take out!  Recommended!"}
{"text":"This place was nice- food was good and interior was simple and clean, perfect for small and large parties. The beef ho fun reminded me of HK, giving off the satisfying \"wok smell.\" Beef and flat noodles themselves were also cooked well. Twiced cooked pork was also solid- tasted as expected. My friend also got the vegetarian fried rice- only disappoint would be the hot chill oil we asked for; it was straight up just oil. Overall, service was very fast and good, with decent portions. Would come again, especially given the abundance of items on the menu."}
{"text":"Simply the best asian food I ever had! We only ordered vegetarian plates to share since one of our friends does not eat meat and I had absolutely no regrets. Everything was extremely appetizing, generous, tasty and fresh. The sauteed szechuan cabbage and the sliced potatoes on a hot plate were my absolutely favorite. The place looks great too and easily accomodates groups of 8 thanks to the circular tables. Did I mention it was particularly cheap? Try it, you will not regret it."}
