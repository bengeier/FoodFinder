{"text":"Pig-N-Vittles is a small lunch only restaurant located in the corner of a furniture/craft store.  It is off the road and a little hard to find.  It appears that their main business is a BBQ catering for events, grad parties, and receptions.   We had the brisket plate and BBQ Chicken sandwich.  The sauces are on the side and you have a choice of a couple at the indoor picnic tables.  Both dishes were surprisingly good.   The meats were smoked and there was plenty for a lunch portion.  I also enjoy trying the different type of BBQ sauces they offered which were also good.  The people were very nice and accommodating.   We had one in our group that did not want BBQ (yeah...not sure what is wrong with her) and they made her a grilled cheese sandwich which was not on the menu.    Will definitely stop by for lunch next time I am in Monroe."}
{"text":"Very inexpensive barbecue place. BBQ was very tasty. Chicken was nice too. Very yummy beans. Didn't love the red slaw but I'm picky about slaw. Daughter liked her grilled cheese. Nice people. Would go back. Very tucked away though! Would never have known it was there if not for Yelp."}
{"text":"I bought the pulled BBQ chicken plate and the chicken was dry!!! I try to support local businesses but when they can't be on point, I gots to move on.."}
{"text":"Hands down, best BBQ in Monroe. The Brunswick stew is awesome as well. It's a little confusing where they are located.(The entrance is on the far left side of the building fyi) Check em out!! Everything tastes fresh, properly seasoned and cooked. I've been looking for a local BBQ place without having to leave the town of Monroe, and here it is."}
{"text":"We had our annual family party and decided to use Pig-N-Vittles to do the catering. Maureen was a pleasure to work with and wow the food was over the top good. We got 15 lbs of pulled pork and 10 lbs of chicken, baked beans and slaw and had endless compliments on how good the food was. We also got a pound of beef brisket just as a sampler and tender and moist only begin to describe how good it is. Everyone wanted to know where we got the food and where they are located. We will definitely be back. Thanks, Michael"}
{"text":"This pic is the remainder of my food. I just couldn't eat it. My husband and I are barbecue lovers but this place simply didn't make the cut on our list.    I feel like I threw my money away"}
{"text":"Great hidden hole in the wall. Very friendly an pleasant staff. I had the smoked chicken and my girlfriend had the BBQ sandwich they were both awesome. Both sauces were great I loved the carolina style while my girlfriend loved the sweet style. The dining room was cozy an loved the picnic tables. I will be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"I noticed a sign for \"bbq\" from the road and dropped in. It was kind of an odd location and could probably use more prominent signage to make it easier to identify. Anywhoo, I ordered the pulled pork barbecue plate with baked beans and fries. The pork was SOOOOOOO moist and they give you a good size serving! The bun was fresh. Beans were tasty. The fries were battered/breaded or something. I don't usually care for those, but they were delicious! The staff was super friendly. I would definitely come back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Clean, clever design with picnic tables in center. Helpful staff. And the BBQ is good!  The baked beans are nice with a slight 'kick. ' They offer sweet or vinegar sauces.  A little bit hard to find, so listen to your GPS.  It will take you to odd places. Just do what it says. Another person was looking for it at the same time as me. We cut into a business park and the road was slightly hidden behind a building.  I believe there's a direct way off Independence Blvd., but it looked as if it was wrong....but it was correct."}
{"text":"Ordered the bbq sandwich and market side- smoked mozzarella, tomato, and olives on a skewer. AMAZING. This is what bbq is supposed to taste like! We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch, really good. BBQ was very tender, sauces were great, had the tater salad side which was delicious! Staff was very friendly as well! Would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Just stopped by for lunch, The BBQ, White slaw, fries, and beans were all excellent! I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Highly recommend!  Ordered catering from here for my daughter's first birthday.  They were super easy to work with.  We received tons of compliments on the BBQ (both chicken and Pork).    My husband loved the Brunswick stew also.  Definitely will be back for lunch soon!"}
