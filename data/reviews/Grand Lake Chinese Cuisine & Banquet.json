{"text":"My family frequents here quite often and know the staff very well.  Service is always reliable and super friendly to accommodate our requests.  They are very well priced and delicious and of course authentic as you'd expect from Chinese restaurants in markham.  Both their dim sum and dinner menus are fantastic and if you get a chance try their nightly desserts as well.  Their dessert/pastry chef is always trying to invent new things for his customers."}
{"text":"Another place I like to come for dim sum in the area. They have a good variety of dim sum choices and a flat rate for all sizes.  They do have push carts at this location, which is great for people that still like to have dim sum this way rather than checking off a piece of paper.   We have only tried their dinner offerings once. But found the food too salty and the food was just average.  Note: this place does take credit cards which is great as a lot of Chinese places are cash only."}
{"text":"My family and I come here regularly.  It is one of the better dim sum restaurants in Markham at a reasonable price.  We enjoy the lotus paste buns, bbq pork buns, sticky rice wrap in lotus leaves , spare ribs in black bean source, shrimp cheung fun, bean curd rolls, ha gow, shrimp rolls, pork dumplings, and of course chicken feet.  We make it a point to bring our out of town guests here for good authentic dim sum."}
{"text":"For some reason, my friends like to go to Grand Lake for our special occasion meals. I have been there numerous times already but this is the first time I have brought my camera along. Today, we were celebrating the fact that one of us had a AMAZING NEW job. With this in mind, we had to have a celebration and a 5.5 lb lobster was the victim of our festivities.   Overall, the ambiance was your typical Chinese place - crowded, loud, and clean enough. There was no real service besides that of refilling the teapot / getting the bill / explaining the dishes.   Now, onto the FOOD: The vegetables was ok (not enough spice but I like mine with Belachan Singaporean style) though it was perfectly wokked up (still crunchy). The egg quiche was DELISH due to its smooth texture (so silky smooth that it slides down your throat - sounds kinda dirty but you know what I mean). The ribs were perfectly spiced with enough zing and zang (but really, I can't see any Chinese restaurant going wrong with this one). The highlight however, was the LOBSTER!!! It was fried in salted egg batter and tasted so good that all of us were scrapping the remaining crumbs off the dish. It was cooked just perfect (moist yet crumbly with batter). Mmm mmm good! I might just go by myself and order up a smaller lobster!"}
{"text":"Cheap dim sum with decent quality. Huge variety of dim sum being rolled around on the carts, so keep an eye out! It gets quite busy, as with most dim sum places, especially on weekends. Don't expect anything too fancy though."}
{"text":"Would've been 4 stars, but I took one off since our Christmas dinner took 3 hours instead of the usual 2 hours due to the timing of dishes arriving at our table. Food was good, but not memorable. The steamed egg thing is nice. The yellow chicken was nicer than it looked. The lobster was good, with lots and lots of meat. Bathrooms were gross, and they have a step up to the urinals so watch out! The nice thing is that it was close to the 407 and I also happened to run into an old friend. Anyways."}
{"text":"Food is good, very flavorful. The biggest problem was ordering. Seeing as we weren't Chinese, the servers were straight up avoiding our table because they couldn't speak English. It was just extremely stressful ordering. For at least 25 minutes we were trying to communicate with the several waiters and waitresses. Next time you come here, bring a Chinese friend. LOL"}
{"text":"I love this Chinese restaurant.  They really know how to take care of their clientele, and the food is always fresh and wonderfully cooked.  For Chinese new year: -Young suckling pig surrounded by jelly fish -Peking duck, two ways -- pancake style --lettuce wrap - roasted crispy chicken with shrimp chips -deep fried oysters, two ways -seafood soup - fried fish fillets - dried scallops with fat choy and young snow pea greens - cantonese style lobster - fried rice - rice noodles with beef - red bean dessert - mango pudding in the shape of fish - mini curl cakes - almond cookies and sesame cookie balls  Now that's how we celebrate Chinese New Year!  Luckily Dad paid!  Thanks Dad!  We all left the restaurant stuffed and happy with giant smiles.  I love Chinese banquet style food and this place really knows how to do it!"}
{"text":"Grand Lake restaurant is a popular place for the locals.  As mentioned on previous review, parking is a huge problem.  We arrived around 4:45 pm and found plenty of parking, so try to get there early.  We ordered: - Stir Fried Diced Chicken with Cashew.  Very tasty perfectly seasoned and prepared. (8/10) - Deep Fried Crispy Chicken, Whole, tonight special half-priced (can't beat that deal).  Chicken wasn't oily or salty.  It was delicious. (9/10)  - Sweet and Sour Pork with Pineapple.  (8/10) - Stir Fried Snow Pea leaves. (8/10) - Beef Fried Noodles with Black Bean Sauce.  It was average for us, nothing special.  (7/10)  Service was great from start to finish.  Our waiter was extremely patient with us (since non of us speak Chinese).  The rest of the staffs were equally terrific in fulfilling our requests (with 5 little ones, it can be overwhelming).    Overall service rating: 9/10"}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum, price is 2.48 after 11 on weekdays. The price seemed good and there was a lineup considering it was a weekday. But when we actually got in, the service was terrible. They were having a lot of problems in the kitchen because all the waiters were confused and scrambling around. Total time we waited was around an hour or so but we just ordered 7 things."}
{"text":"Good advice:  since it's often easy to overlook friendships when days are busy with work and family commitments, establish some traditions and follow through.  Each year, a group of about 20 of us meet to eat Chinese style to celebrate the coming of spring. The events are organized by the beautiful Miss T who selects the location and menu.  Her choice this year was Grand Lake.  What a good choice too:  fresh food and good service for less than $25 a person."}
{"text":"They have had new renovations. This was my go to place before and now it's definitely a place I'll be going to even more frequently. Their food has improved by miles, best in its area. and the portion sizes are HUGE largest in its area and prices are the cheapest.    The quality of food is way better than before. It's the best dim sum restaurant in the Markham/Richmond hill area right now. They keep getting better and other places are only getting worse.  Their portions are double the size of other restaurants.   Price is the cheapest in Markham/Richmond hill as well. It's around $3 for S/M/L and XL pretty much all day.  It's getting more busy now that it's the best dim sum in the area. Usually you have a couple tables empty at all times but now you have to wait. It's very clean compared to other Chinese restaurants. Their plates and silverware are spotless."}
{"text":"I've had dinner at this restaurant a few times. My experiences were ok until tonight (Fathers day). I found a dead fly in my bowl of rice halfway through the meal, and showed the waiter. He did change the rice and apologize, and we thought it's Father's Day and we don't want to cause problems, so we just took the new bowl of rice and continue our dinner. but I can't believe they actually charge us for the replacement (I wasn't the one paid for the bill so I only saw it after we left).  So disappointed at this place. Will not go back there again."}
{"text":"Please note this review is regarding the dinner, not the dim sum.   This place is always packed for dinner on the weekends, make a reservation a few days before to ensure you have a table. Very hard to find close parking also.  My family likes to come here for the \"lobster set meal\". It is currently $188 and it includes Peking duck, steamed fish, a giant lobster (3 dishes), braised spare ribs, bok choi, soup, and dessert.  Food - Very inconsistent, the meal could be perfect one day and the next it could be terrible. Don't expect top notch quality here, but for the price, the meal is very much worth it. They do not specialize in making Peking duck, hence it may not be the best, but it is not bad either. My personal favourite is the steamed egg with lobster. Unlike many other cuisines, the egg has strong lobster taste and the egg is not too watery.    Service - staff are very helpful and friendly (especially Cindy and Ken), but I do agree they are understaffed  Overall 4/5 for the inconsistency and understaffing."}
{"text":"For dim sum If you order before 10:30 almost everything is priced at the small dim sum price. My family and I come here often since we don't have to wait. Biggest annoyance for dim sum time with family is logistically bringing everyone to the destination then waiting for over half an hour for a seat. So usually this place doesn't require for us to wait, and they take reservations.   Dim sum quality is quite good and there is a good variety. Service is quick and efficient, what you would expect for most restaurants that need quick table turnovers. nonetheless, I rarely feel rushed here.   Dinner quality, I've come in for Chinese New Year dinner as well as normal dinner. Their set meals are pretty good and economical. For Chinese New Year there are a lot of dishes that they don't do probably because profit margin is too low or prep time is too long. Either way I would rather stay home for the events that everyone chooses to eat out.   Overall, I frequent this place and will continue to with family."}
{"text":"The name of this place has nothing to do with anything pertaining to the restaurant. It's like naming a nightclub 'Zen', it just has nothing to do with what's going on.  Picked up Stephanie on a lazy Sunday morning from Markham, and she recommended this place for dim sum. So, how we she led me through the wrong door and into the wrong restaurant was a total waste of time.  The wait didn't take more than five minutes, and we were sat upon the table we were shown was cleaned up.  I don't understand why we were led to our table, and then a cleaning crew was summoned.  Wouldn't it made more sense if they cleaned it first, and then ushered us to our table?    The décor was horrible, but I was too hungry to care.  Nobody in Canada goes for Sunday morning dim sum and renders any judgement on the ambiance. Stephanie spoke Cantonese, I speak Mandarin. We could have both shared in the responsibility of ordering, but I thought I let her do all the work while I hinted at which items I wanted with the movements of my eyebrows.  The service of the food is probably tolerable to most people, as half of it required the trolly woman to further servicing it for convenience.  The salesmanship..r the saleswomanship is simply not there.  If you trouble one of these old trolly women to examine the food, and decide not to buy it, you get a cut-eye.  All the food items are hollered out in Cantonese, so I need a look, man! Regardless, I got a half dozen dirty looks.  The concept is all wrong, if you are not going to assess your clients age demographic and thus determining what to cook for best saleability, then at least hire some young skirt in heels to sell the damn things.   Yeah, I said.  I wouldn't buy what I don't want, but I'd be more inclined to purchase something I don't know, just as long as it's being sold to my by a pair of nice legs and some cleavage.  Quicker way to get rid of the less popular foods. I'm not saying that they should run the old women out of a job, but if you want an air of authenticity, then hire some less disgruntled people.  I ain't looking for beef on Sunday mornings with old bitches.   Food is satisfactory, but the good stuff never come around enough. I guess I just order a lobster, or a menu...but who's got that appetite on Sunday mornings?  I feel guilty already skipping Church...gluttony ain't gonna make me feel better."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner... and it was not good at all The service was slow and after 2 dishes (strangely, the peking duck arrived first) we had to wait a very long time for our food. Our rice came last... so we were full before we got our rice! I felt ignored for much of dinner.... our teapot was empty and we had empty plates and no one seemed to care. However when we talked to our server he was pretty quick in getting us everything after we asked for it. The complimentary soup was pretty good and flavourful... no complaints there.  The Peking duck, as I said, arrived in about 10 minutes. Which is NOT a good thing, because they obviously just quickly fried the duck instead of roasting it. The fat was still left on the skin, which was not crispy at all and felt like I was chewing rubber. The duck meat itself had no flavour. The second course (lettuce wraps) was pretty flavourless and bland too and the veggies in it did not taste fresh. I was very disappointed. It was probably the worst Peking duck I've had in my life. The eggplant and tofu hot pot was ok... nothing special. I like eggplant a lot though and will eat it in pretty much any shape or form. The rest of my family was not happy at all with this dish. The spare ribs in honey pepper sauce: love honey pepper sauce, but the ribs were so difficult to chew I had to literally rip the meat off with my teeth. Not fun... we barely ate any because it was so chewy.  The fried rice took a very long time to arrive and was undercooked. The price was cheap... we spent around $75 for 4 people. But we won't be coming back... because the food was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Weekday dinner for 2.  There was plenty of parking in the shopping center. This is a large full service restaurant with an extensive menu.  We noticed a group of 30-40 people playing marjong in the banquet rooms next to the main dining area.  Our waiter told us they met daily on weekdays.  After playing they had dinner.  Otherwise the restaurant was quiet.  Since there were many free tables we were seated promptly.  The staff was friendly throughout the evening.    We ordered sauteed sole fillet with snow peas & battered deep fried green beans.  Both dishes were very delicious.  The portions while good were not overly generous.  We easily finished both entrees.    At the end of our meal I noticed a woman a few tables away had been dining with a small dog on her lap.  It was not a service dog so it was a probable health code violation.  As they walked out a staffperson bent over to pet the dog & chatted with its' owner.  Since they didn't take the health code seriously, I began to imagine a host of other health violations....it made me extremely uneasy.  Consequently, I hesitate to return or recommend. A shame since the food was good & the service friendly."}
{"text":"Crowded restaurant at the Peachtree asian plaza. This was an early gathering for our Chinese New Year dinner. Although we made reservations, the wait was still 20 minutes long. Family Day probably partially contributed to the chaos:P  Our table ordered around nine dishes, half were meat. I have to say all the meat dishes were amazingly super delicious! Cannot emphasize that more!! XD  There was sweet and sour pork that had the perfect cut pork ribs with tender meat (not too fatty or lean), sweet ribs that had the same quality has the pork ribs, and honey-dipped fish fillets that was sooo soft on the inside yet cripsy on the outside. Everything was highly chewable, actually its soft enough you don't really have to chew. The night's all-star would definitely go to the fish fillets - it was really well done!  We also had lots of veggie dishes. Those were pretty good too but incomparable to their meats. I do have to say that they flavour their veggies quite a lot too.  Overall service was good given there were many tables and customers. The place was noisy per usual chinese restaurants - no complaints though:)  I would love to go back and eat their main meat dishes."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Service is ok because they are too busy. Duck and sticky rice stuffed chicken must be pre-ordered but totally worthy."}
{"text":"Came here for Chinese new years eve dinner and food was okay~  The chicken tasted average, the lobster tasted delicious well flavored, the soup tasted too thick , the vegetables was too oily, steam fish tasted good but  the fish was probably dead,  also ordered tofu with scallops which had little scallops that had sand in it  but the tofu was good.   Overall food was good but I was super thirsty after .. Probably the msg kicked in."}
{"text":"Father Day bring my father to this restaurant for dinner and while we eating we find a dead fly inside the rice."}
{"text":"This place us not the greatest place for dim sum, but very close to home! The food is alright but the price is very reasonable for the quality! It's less of the line than most places and the staffs are very happy and nice!!!!"}
{"text":"I read below that this place was a \"hit or miss\" so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and say it was just a miss today. I came with a large party of 13 so it's safe to say that we ordered enough dishes to have a good sense of their food quality. The food here is edible but lacking in all aspects. The pastries didn't have enough browning on the crust, the taste of the dimsum was bland, the rice noodle skins were poorly made.. And many other flaws.  I would not come back again."}
{"text":"Grand Lake is the place our family go almost every Sunday!  The dim sum in here never disappoint us. Egg tarts are the best compare to many other places.  On weekend there's an early bird special if you pay your bill by 11:30am!"}
{"text":"We came here for dimsum for lunch on the weekend, and it wasn't too busy as there were open tables for two. However, right beside our table was a trolley of dirty dishes that I had to ask multiple workers to remove before one of the managers finally did. This was very unappealing as you can imagine, and a big turnoff. We also asked for the english menu which they never gave us. I guess you just don't get the same type of attention when you're not Chinese speaking. The food was very mediocre. The cha siu in the rice rolls and buns were odd tasting compared to everywhere else i've had them. Not your usual bbq flavour that was sweet, but kind of salty? Probably won't be my dimsum destination again when I'm not with my Chinese relatives."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum for the first time with my mom on a weekday afternoon.  The whole restaurant was almost at full capacity but we didn't have to wait to get a table.  The dim sum at best was mediocre but majority of all the dim sum were very poor in quality.   The deep fried shrimp dumpling was fried in very old oil as the colour was very dark, the wrap was very chewy as this was likely from leftovers that was retried to sell.   Steam pork wrapped with bean curd - this the most disgusting item that day.  The bean curd had a strong rotten taste.   Deep fried taro with minced pork - was delicious upon first bite but further into the taro there was an odd taste of ammonia.   Congee - plain and bland with no palatable flavour whatsoever.   Shrimp dumpling ha gow- the putter wrap fell apart upon attempting to pick up with chopsticks.  Flavour was okay.   Steam shrimp dumpling with snow pea - this was the best tasting item, it was delicious.   Steam shrimp rice noodle roll - shrimp was good size and rice noodle roll was good.   Overall this place for dim sum is very inexpensive but you get what you pay for. As for myself it was a waste of calories and I won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"This is our go to dim sum restaurant. It's not the decor, that we go for, it's the decent, traditional dim sum that makes us go back. I love to get duck web parcels, steamed fish heads, chui chow dumplings, pork stomach in black peppercorn soup, etc. in fact, it's all proper traditional dim sum made the proper traditional way. I hate all these places that add their own twist and make this crappy fusion dim sum. Adding and omitting different ingredients into the dishes.  They just do this so that they can charge more money or because they can't make it properly. You shouldn't mess with traditional dishes, it's part of the yam cha history and culture. The place can be really noisy because they have mah Jong parties there but it all adds to the nostalgia of yam cha. Also, the place gets busy even during the weekdays and you need to wait for a table but it's not normally longer than a 20 minute wait. Prices are the same for S, M or L dim sum and other dishes are not expensive either. If you're looking for a regular, ok dim sum place then come here. If you're looking to eat the decor or a quiet lunch then this ain't the place. Service is not bad either, it's a real neighbourhood joint feeling. We've been here for dinner a few times and it ain't bad either but it does get busy, might be better to make a reservation."}
{"text":"We come here every year for a family dinner to celebrate Chinese New Year. We get one of those 10-course meals and everything is usually very prompt, fresh and tasty.   Have never come here for just a normal dinner, but the annual feast for 20 people never disappoints."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for dim sum for years and have never really had a bad experience. but over the years the quality and service has declined. We came here for Sunday morning Dim Sum and wait was short for dim sum on a weekend. We got seated and ordered quickly. They removed the english from their menus so you will have to ask for an English only menu if you cannot read Chinese or have someone who can read Chinese order.   What really brought this review down is the time it took our dishes. We ordered 12 dishes and yes you will not get all the dishes at the same time I know that's not how dim sum works. But we also shouldnt be waiting 10-15 minutes in between each single dish. Like that is ridiculous. The first dish alone took 20 minutes to arrive after placing our order. We started to get hungry so we would eat the one dish that came and sit and wait for the next dish. It made the meal unenjoyable to say the least. We just got frustrated near the end. We arrived around 12 and around 1:30 we were still waiting for the last 3 dishes WTF. We have wave one of the guys down and ask where our dishes were and he asked what are we missing. ummmm... if you look down at the menu where we check off what we order you can see the outstanding items. He needed us to read the menu off to him and then he looked at it himself. wtf. Then he goes to check the kitchen and somehow miricalously comes out with one of our missing dishes out of nowhere. Is this what you need to do to get your food?! Holler at someone?! Even when he came to bring out dishes he was all pissy. Like fuck I know you don't want to be here but we are paying for this. A grown ass man throwing a hissy fit really professional (NOT).   TLDR: The food is still good everything came out hot and well cooked. But the service is atrocious.People there don't want to be there and it shows. The kitchen and staff need to get it together there should be no reason why people are sitting for over an hour for food. The price and food is not worth the nightmare. Ruins your entire mood."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place for as long as I can remember. It has stood the test of time and to this day, is almost always packed. My grandparents are regulars here so on most special occasions or holidays, we come here. Even if it's not a special occasion, we sometimes come here for dim sum. I've seen them improve over the years as they added new dishes and redecorated. Both their dim sum menu and dinner menu are pretty good. I really can't complain, I've probably been to this restaurant more times than any other restaurant in the world and I still don't mind it."}
{"text":"We are 10 minutes into our meal and I'm annoyed already! They served us soup that is expected at most decent Chinese restaurants... although service has been off already. When they give you soup, they should also give you 10 soup bowls. I've been to this place a few times now, but this time I feel mad.  Omg now I'm at the end of my meal and omfg her attitude is like a butcher legit she is like glaring on me with a Dark Vader look. My whole experience of eating made me want to throw up. Her expression the whole time is like the \"I'm ready to slap you\" face. I'm absolutely disappointed too because the food was overly salty too. The food was okay...better than the food tho     If you feel like being glared in with like a hissing expression this place is right for you. Btw do yourself a favour AND DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE.  (In this review I wasn't exaggerating at all, after this meal I feel scared that this will haunt me. I will not come here again.)"}
{"text":"We come here 2-3 times a month. Grand Lake Chinese Cuisine (Tai Wu) has been here for decades!  You should come early, like before 10am, if you don't want to wait around for seats because this place has a lot of regular customers. Sometimes, you will see them space off a room for a group of people to play mahjong.   In addition, the perks of coming early include before 11:00am, there are specials on dim sum on weekends. I don't think many of these are around anymore, but it's still the push cart dimsums, unless they don't have many customers, than you can write it on the sheet of paper.   I love their wrapped rice dishes including the sticky rice, the ??, and the ??? is also delicious. Watch out for the baked pudding custard with saigo at the bottom. That only comes out on weekends and it's DELICIOUS. Their ?? is really traditional, though smaller than other places that make them huge nowadays."}
{"text":"My first impression when I walked through the door at Grand Lake Chinese cuisine is that this place smells really bad. When I walked to our table, pulled out the chair and saw the nasty stained seat cover, I was in shock. I wasn't sure if I should sit down before first checking my vaccination records. I wanted to wash my hands before eating, but given how nasty the main restaurant is, I dared not venture into the men's washroom without a full hazmat suit. Geez, what a dump! How did this place pass the last health inspection?  We ordered a bunch of items from the super value customized combo menu. The food is cheap and comes fast. But the quality of the food is not great, and everything is quite greasy. I would rather pay slightly more to eat at Top Choice in the same plaza, where I can get similar style food that tastes better, uses better ingredients, and is far less greasy.  The servers are all pleasant and friendly, and the food is okay, so two stars for that. But the thought of sitting on that nasty soiled seat cover really ruined my appetite. After eating at this place, I feel the need to shower. Ewww! Won't be back!"}
{"text":"This used to be my fav place for dim sum but their quality drastic plummeted into the abyss as of recent.   When I used to come here, I loved that their tea was already steeped with full flavour, and it was hot. Now, the tea is still hot, but honestly tastes like just hot water for the first few refills. Nobody wants to drink a bucket of hot water!   Their turnip cake was a well loved dish as they had lots of toppings. Recently, their turnip cake was seriously lacking. It was so pale it was practically fluorescent. Each slice had about two measly chunks of topping. And they didn't even grill it properly. Not a single edge was brown. It was equivalent of eating square mush.   Their shrimp dumpling (??) has way too thick of a skin, which hides the flavour of the shrimp. A good shrimp dumpling should have thin skin so that you can crunch into the shrimp. Then again, maybe I'm just picky about shrimp dumplings.   Their congee is good, though, lots of toppings. We always get the preserved egg salty meat one because it's just amazing. It may not look like you get any toppings but you have to mix it thoroughly.   Finally, the ambience. There is enough space to walk around. It's a Chinese restaurant so I'm not sure if you should expect a waitress asking how your food is (let's be real... Do any Chinese restaurants do that? Ever??). Their utensils are relatively clean.   I'd say to stay away from eating their live seafood. They have fish tanks customers can see, and I saw a dead fish floating in there the whole time I was there and nobody picked it out. Dead fish have lots of germs that humans can't withstand. That's quite dangerous."}
{"text":"Never ever come here without making a reservation, especially on a weekend. My family has been coming here since birth so they're pretty familiar with the staff and can easily get a table anytime. However, coming here by myself on a sunday morning with some friends = NO. They don't know you = they won't help you. The hostess that's usually at the front, Cindy, is so so so friendly to my parents. However, she didn't bat an eye at me and didn't even give me a # for the waiting list. Soooo my friends and I were literally just standing there for no reason at all.  Since the only times I've eaten here successfully is among the company of my family, I've always had amazing service but I do notice that the ladies wheeling the trollies do NOT look happy (neither would I, to be honest) and everybody looks like they're 2000% done with everything and everyone. The food is okay for dim sum, I've definitely had worse. I remember I loved having that tofu dessert here. My dad used to always order me the fried chicken wings (for breakfast omg) back when I was a meat-eater and I loved loved loved it.   Generally, not a horrible place to go in markham for dim sum if you have family that are regulars.. other than that, not a nice place to chill with your friends for some dim sum breakie in the morning.   Parking is ridiculous as well."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends looking specifically for Peking duck in Markham and was decently satisfied with Grand Lakes overall. It won't impress, but gets the job done.  We ended up just ordering a 7 course set meal that included Peking duck for $89 - which is a pretty good value considering the quality and quantity of the food given.   The Peking duck was good itself, the skin being crisp and the meat not being too dry. But there's definitely better duck to be found. Carrots and scallions were provided with hoisin sauce and the wraps were quite tasty. However, their pancakes were rather dry and thicker than we would have liked. There was 5 of us, and there was only enough to have two wraps each, so there were 10 wraps in total. I would assume that the duck was only a half and not a full (which would be the point of ordering it on its' own for $30?), The second course of the duck didn't impress. It was cooked and served in a pancake which wasn't entirely baked/cooked and was especially bland overall. We actually wanted to order the lettuce wraps instead but they forgot to tell the kitchen and couldn't fulfil our request.   The other dishes were typical and were quite tasty. I especially liked the fried fish in honey pepper sauce. It's was sweet and tangy, and had a smokiness to it, something barbecue-esque. There was soup to start and even some red bean soup/cookies to end the meal. It was a very well balanced set meal that was well worth it."}
{"text":"They recently opened with some interior renovations. Their dim sum prices are slightly higher now. Dimsum mon-friday is $2.88 for s/m/l from 9-4pm. Sat and sunday is $3.18 from 9-4. Tea price is $1.00/person. We got several dishes today everything was fresh and hot. The rice wrapped in lotus leaf was a bit bland. We got the special made congee with fish slice and pork liver for $4.99 (+$1 on weekends). The portion was big and it was so flavourful. Definitely recommend that congee. The steamed bbq pork bun was good too they really placed emphasis on the garlic. The plain cheung fun was a bit too chewy for my liking. The braised duck feet with chestnut was so good. Flavourful yet not too overpowering. Service was ok. In conclusion, nothing special about this place. Dim sum was alright."}
{"text":"Visited this gourmet Chinese cuisine on Saturday in a party of 8.  Grand Lake was absolutely packed!!  Grand Lake is a large restaurant with many tables and even more customers.  We had to wait around 20 minutes before getting seated but it was well worth the wait.   We got the standard pork and carrot soup for starters and ordered an 8 dish combo with 8 white rice.  The dishes we chose are: -peking duck -duck pieces delight (the cooked dish with the rest of the duck not used in peking duck) -large snow crab -beef with guilan (chinese vegetable) -mushroom \"shaguo\" (soup or stew in a hot pot) -free range chicken -bean sprouts with garlic -sweet and sour pork  The highlights of the meal, peking duck and crab, were delightful.  The peking duck pieces were the right size and had a perfect mix of skin and duck, cooked perfectly.  The crab was also amazing.  The other dishes were well made and seasoned to taste.  Personally, I like the bean sprouts and the mushroom stew, and did not find any fault in any of the dishes.  (We had red bean soup for dessert.)  Of note is the above average service I experienced at this restaurant.  They managed to get everything right and handled our requests quickly and courteously.    Grand Lake charges above average prices for a Chinese restaurant.  The higher quality food and service it offers makes it worth the price.  3.8 / 5.0"}
{"text":"Read as 4.5 Excellent option for a nice Saturday brunch.  Monday to Friday and Saturdays before 11am is $2.3 each (s/m/l) - which is definitely the cheapest dim sum you'll get in this area! It is packed though, on Saturdays and Sundays so be sure to head in early for a spot! Prices do go up on Saturdays/Sunday after 11am, but they are still very economical and reasonable.  Dim sum here on Saturdays and Sundays are in trolleys so don't ever be shy to flag them down and ask what they have in their trolley.  All these ladies are extremely friendly and helpful! Mondays to Fridays though, their dim sum is done through the sheets, which to be honest, is less \"fun\" of an experience...  The tea is very good here, and they do an excellent job of refilling it multiple times over the course of the meal.  The dimsum is okay, and they do an amazing job of giving you a good deal for what you pay. Service is amazing as long as you're not shy to ask for something! They usually charge a $1 tea charge or whatever they call it (table cloth, etc) for the entire table which is, again, a great deal considering most other tea places charge you $1 per person...  Dinner is lovely here too, although be sure to check that there isn't a wedding or month-old baby dinner that night, since the food/service generally seems to slow down on those nights.  Dinner is still relatively cheap and simple, but still good compared to other nearby restaurants. Also, dinner tends to be quieter and a slightly calmer environment...  People generally tip around 8-10% and the staff generally don't matter how much you tip!   Note though, the environment isn't top-notch as you expect from its price - it is a loud bustling atmosphere! All in all, though, definitely a must-go for dim-sum in Markham!"}
{"text":"This place is great for everyday dinner. Its specialty is the stuffed chicken with sticky rice. This dish has to be pre-ordered because it is not easy to make.  Also, it also has fresh large scallops served over a garlic sauce.  Everything else is tasty and typical for a Chinese restaurant. Not bad and I highly recommend it for good food with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I may have been here decades ago. The vibe has changed and it's not as busy as I had imagined on a Saturday for dim sum. The food is alright but the cost for the main dim sum (har gow and siu mai) were XP (around $4.00)? A bit pricey considering it's not a fancy place with aged decor and uncomfortable chairs. Also had to ask for the bill 4 times before a server willingly walked over. I think the only highlight was the \"Singaporean\" fried radish cakes. Portion was good and shrimps were fresh."}
{"text":"The Dry Fish Peanut Pork Rib congee is good - pork is so soft & tender One of the few places that has Sesame Filling Bun - good runny filling!  Didn't see sago pudding on the menu anymore..."}
{"text":"Went here last month for dim sum with family. We called the night before and reserved a Saturday-10am (prime dimsum hour) slot for two tables, which they gave us on the dais (\"stage\"). Parking was ample in the lot, which was really convenient. The FOOD was just scrumptious... quite possibly THE BEST dimsum I've ever eaten (in comparison to US, HK, and China). There was about 20 of us including adults and kids. When all was tallied up, it only came to be $138CAD (roughtly $112US)!! I've never had such amazing dimsum for such an inexpensive tab before, especially with a large party. I wish they had a place like this in the States, I'd go all the time!"}
{"text":"This place is really good and especially the dim sum which I always go when I have a chance. This restaurant still have old fashion push cart dim sum although it is only available on weekends and it is also a bit more expensive. One dim sum cost around $2.88 on weekends and $2.68 on weekdays. The decor is outdated tho and you can tell because those chairs you sit on have clearly passed their useful life. This is an authentic Chinese restaurant and I would highly recommended and you can tell how popular it is in Markham because it is always busy even on weekdays morning."}
{"text":"Came her for dim sum on a Saturday morning at about 10:15am. Surprisingly there were a few tables still available but they were filled up shortly after. This is an old school push cart dim sum so the food may not be as fresh as the made to order dim sum places. The carts came around pretty fast. Food was decent. The one thing that stood out for me was that they had sweet lotus paste bun which is really hard to find in other dim sum places. Another dish I really liked was sweet custard with tapioca. Its like a creme brule without the hard sugary top. It tasted really good. Not overly sweet and with a strong flavour of condensed milk. The other dishes were pretty standard.  They have different early bird specials for weekdays and weekends until 11:30am. $2.68 for S,M,L dishes. Overall a decent dim sum place if you like the old school push cart style."}
{"text":"We came to Grand Lake Chinese Cuisine & Banquet for my grandma's surprise 80th birthday party! We had a private area for ourselves (two tables for 20 people). Place was absolutely packed on a Sunday evening, it was practically impossible to find parking. We went up and down the parking lot for 20 minutes before we finally found a spot. Yeesh.  They weren't kidding when they said Markham is 99% Asians.  Anyways, for food, each table had the same dishes and it was a massive amount of Chinese goodness. We had a 10+ course meal and everything was delicious. Staff was fast, served out dishes, etc. They even let us bring in our cake which was a nice touch.  I'm not sure if this is the best in the area but it certainly met our expectations - good food!"}
{"text":"Went here on an early weekend morning for dim sum.   The decor has seen better days. Someone at some point tried to make the room elegant with ornate wainscotting and chair rails. The chipped paint and cracked wood everywhere suggests that someone else stopped trying.   There is a modern abstract painting off in the corner that probably wandered in from a hipper restaurant and is now wondering why it's sitting next to a dusty golden Chinese dragon with a gleaming red eye. The lone TV off to the side is far too small for the space, but all it's showing is a Just For Laughs gag reel on endless loop, so no real harm.   And the dim sum. This is a very traditional restaurant. There's no \"fusion anything\" to be seen on this menu, which is completely fine since sometimes you just crave simple dim sum. They are also one of the few restaurants that has pitch black pork hock in ginger and vinegar. They do it well, if rubbery eggs are what you want!  So basically, everything you expect to see on this menu, and nothing you don't.   While the decor has suffered over time, the prices have only gone up. Dishes previously priced as a \"large\" on the English menu have been scratched over with a pen and reclassified with the rarified \"special\".  When you go to dim sum, my feeling is that steamed shrimp dumpling should not be premium priced. And there is no flat rate pricing for coming in before 11, so the final bill was definitely high for what we got.   The food was ok. Pork hock in ginger and vinegar aside, some of the other dim sum was over-steamed and still cold (how did they manage to do that to the same dish?!?)  The wait staff is experienced and familiar faces abound. They have a comfortable familiarity with many of the patrons, many of whom I'm sure have been coming here for years. Lots of people have their morning paper out as they enjoy their breakfast. Perhaps they are thinking about the good old days, when Grand Lake lived up to its name."}
{"text":"Came here a few times for dinner and it was fine. Lunch service was another story. The food was so so. They got all the usual dim sum fare but quality and taste was below average. Some dishes weren't that tasty. Service was also slow and servers looked grumpy. One dish they kept saying was coming but after 30 mins and 3 servers they finally said they were out. Should have just told us from the beginning so we didn't keep waiting. Think I'll try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Grand Lake has been in the New Kennedy Square for as long as I can remember. Definitely one of the first establishments in the plaza, and it has consistently maintained a loyal clientele.  I've been here a few times in my life, although ever since I joined Yelp I've never came back to dine here until recently. Came here for dim sum, and it was nice that they still use a dim sum cart system (although you can order from the menu if you're in a rush).  Dim sum here in general is okay. I'd say if this was 10-15 years ago it would be one of the best dim sum restaurants in Markham, but times have changed and I've definitely dined in better places. Their prices here, however, are quite good, especially the early bird discounts.  Service is poor if you're not a regular, my table was largely ignored and it seems the employees kept breaking into conversations with tables that were regulars. I don't mind having conversations and all that, but at least do your work and provide hospitality to everyone else...  I wouldn't say no to coming back, however as I stated there's better dim sum restaurants out there now."}
{"text":"awesome, this place was pack. maybe because of chinese new year. but anyhow. I went there solo. ha. I ordered Chinese lettuce (it was great, as good as taiwanese style, but different) fried tofu with shrimp and fish. that one was good too.  and finally with lobster with garlic style (dry). yummy. this place reminds me home and for chinese food. this is great place to get to taste good chinese food. and the good part, this is the only place in the whole complex that accept credit card. I want to see if they sell dimsum for lunch."}
{"text":"Very slow service if you go at the same time that they're hosting a wedding or banquet. Dinner shouldn't be 3.5 hours..."}
{"text":"Parking is a big problem on the weekend. Walking towards the restaurant you could smell a lil stench of garbage... @@ But once ur inside that's when its better. The food was quite good here & we all enjoyed our dinner.  We made our reservation at 6:30pm but the place was already packed . There were already ppl lining up at the door when we got in & as time went on MORE ppl stood waiting. The dishes were served in a hurry ... another place waiting to get rid of us for more patrons. But it was very delicious & tasty!! We had another one of those 8 - 10 course meals again :)  As usual I enjoyed the lettuce wrap w/ minced beef, duck wrap pancake. The lobster was absolutely divine here! It was HUGEEEE. But it was soooo delish!! I could've had the whole thing....:D I would love to do that someday lol The sweet and sour pork was excellent too! My great aunt doesn't like to eat much but she kept eating it... so that should tell you smth ;)  Dinner was prob. around $300 + (approx 13 ppl). I'm not sure as we were treated by family friends.   Come early & make reservations !!"}
{"text":"This place legit went to the shitter. New management sucks ass and prices went up for crap food thag you can get anywhere else. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"This is my uncle's go-to dim sum spot. We have been going every weekend since 7-8 years ago. The food and service is great for the price you are paying. It is a simple and easy classic dim sum place that you can bring your family and friends. All the dishes are good and always on point. It is also not super packed which makes it very comfortable and warm. This place is easily my favourite dim sum restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"This review is for Dim Sum at Grand Lake... and bottom line, if you care more about price than quality, and don't mind arriving by 9 am for the discount deal, and like the novelty of *some* carts on the weekend, then this place is for you.  As for us, the Siu mai, Har gow, Sticky rice in lotus leaf, steamed ribs, and bao (both chicken and BBQ pork) were very bland and the deep fried items all were stone cold, and while not the worst we have ever had, it certainly wasn't worth the trip to Markham!     In future we are sticking to Elegance Chinese for Dim Sum, which while a little bit pricier, was the best flavourwise by a mile, and was indeed elegant and didn't have that dingy dining room feel that Grand Lake has.   Lastly if you don't speak Chinese, good luck asking for something that you don't point to or order on a sheet.  Even the manager at Grand Lake ignored or didn't understand our request for hot sauce (to add some flavour to the bland food!)"}
{"text":"I've been going to Grand Lakes for many years and it had either been a hit or a miss. Most of the times, it has been a hit and when it is a hit, it is very god and worthy for a dim sum restaurant.   Usually gets very busy Sunday mornings, that's when Grand Lake uses the dim sum carts rather than the checklist menu. Some days the service and variety of food in the carts aren't consistent, hence, the possible miss. Although, on weekday mornings, Grand Lake uses the checklist menus which are consistent obviously.   For the food, the quality is by far the best I have ever tasted. I usually eat their Siu Mai, Har Gow, Steamed Rice Noodle Roll, Chicken Feet, and more. All in which taste really good. They also provide complimentary tea and hot sauce.  You could most likely enjoy your dining experience at Grand Lake if you only speak English, just try to exaggerate what you want with your hand movements. Pretty sure most of the servers know basic English but it may be difficult communicating with some.  Overall, quality of food is great and service is tolerable if you only speak English."}
{"text":"This place has been here for ages. It seems to still have some of the original staff and recently renovated a little bit. It could still use some detailing inside to give it a higher end feel but its probably targeting another audience.  The food is honestly average for dinner but the price is AWESOME and the size of the dishes are pretty big. I am surprised to see it 70-80% full for dinner on a Weds.  They used to still have the traditional carts pushing around dim sum but not sure if that still happens anymore. Their dinner combo deal thing is around $10 a dish, we went with 5 people and spent $40-ish for 4 huge dishes. Enough to feed us and take home.  A pretty good selection too. Somewhat noisy though. There were many ppl playing MJ there."}
{"text":"Moderately priced dim sum. Lots of tables and lots of parking. The wait for food is never too long. There is push cart service and a la carte. For four people, it is about $35-40, depending on what you order. Bring more people to try more dishes. Egg tarts are my favourite."}
{"text":"I actually ate here twice, once in 2004 and recently in late 2011.  All in all, this place is not worth it at all given the better talents throughout Markham/Richmond Hill.  It has none of the stand out qualities I look for in a Cantonese style restaurant.  Food is not very fresh, execution is sub par, bathroom is not clean, and food was brought out raw?"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Asian food.  Food was on time and hot. They make the best brown rice that goes well with the food.  Portions are pretty big so expect to take some leftovers for tomorrows lunch."}
{"text":"3.5 star  This review is for the Dim Sum at Grand Lake Chinese Cuisine.  Monday to Friday Early Bird (ordered before 11:30 am) and Afternoon Tea (1:30 pm to 4:00 pm)  or Saturdays/Sundays/Holidays Early Bird Special only (leave by $11:30 am), no afternoon hangover specials  Small/Medium/Large Dim Sums all for $2.20.  We were here on a weekday at around 2 pm, the restaurant was empty aside for another 2 tables.   Dim sum still took awhile to be served to us since all the items are cooked when order.  The dim sum selections (over 90 items to choose from) and  quality are all decent... and all for$ 2.20 each? I am not complaining.  The decor is a little dated, but Grand Lake just feels like a traditional Chinese dim sum place minus the push cart ladies!!  I'll definitely be back for the specials!!!"}
{"text":"I would give Grand Lake 4 star.  Grand Lake is a reasonably priced neighbourhood restaurant that does both regular lunches/dinners and banquets.  It is not a high end restaurant unless you order a banquet style set dinner.  Food: It strikes a good balance among pricing, quality of food and value.  The menu features both very high end dishes (abalone and seafood) and ultra valued choose-your-own set dinner (avg $10/dish except for live fish, lobster, crab and peking duck items).  I usually order from the choose-your-own set dinner menu, and I find the dishes reasonably delicious, though towards the salty side, and of large portion.  There is a large selection of entrees to choose from in the regular menu.  Service - I don't understand what the negative reviews on services are about.  I have been to this restaurant many times for dim sum lunches and family dinners.  The services have always been quite good, especially for dinners.  In conclusion, I will return to Grand Lake for both dinners and lunches."}
{"text":"We came here for a set menu for dinner, which came with about 7 dishes. I can safely say I enjoyed just 1 of them. The soup was poorly flavoured , the fried fish came with mostly bony, small pieces, and the lobster was super bland. So was the vegetarian dish, the fish and veggie dish, and the crispy chicken. The fish and veggie dish came out at room temperature for some reason. The roast pork with jelly fish had the oddest tasting roast pork with the skin very smooth and the pieces of meat flavoured very blandly and cut into tiny pieces. The fried rice was good though.  To top it off, the service was awful. It took 20 minutes to flag a waiter down for the bill. There are way too few waiters for the number of tables."}
{"text":"The food is average in comparison to others. What ticked me off is that we were the next 3 person table for half an hour, and I see small tables opened up, but the waitress let other ppl she knows jam in front of us and let them sit first. My mother finally got frustrated and question the manager about it, the manager got us a table right away without asking us what number we had."}
{"text":"Went here for my moms birthday: 1) no more peking duck at 7 2) ordered normal dishes, first dish (cha siu and roasted duck) took an hour to serve 3) ordered rice, had to ask 3 different servers before getting it 10 minutes later 4) servers are forgetful Would not recommend coming back to this place. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Will not be coming to this place again.   My family and I came here for dinner today.   The food they served is always mixed up with other tables... And they are very unprofessional about it. They literally walk around the whole restaurant searching for that table with the slip of where the food was written.   Their service is directed to those who order the more expensive items.  The food is also served warm or plainly cold.   There's one dish that we ordered that stood out the most, sweet and sour pork, the pork was raw.   There are much better Chinese food places in Markham."}
{"text":"Seven of us went for dinner on Sun 2014-02-23. We ordered their 6-person set dinner for $138 plus the snow-pea sprouts and sweet & sour pork . They included a free dessert (red-bean).  The cost for 7 of us came out to about $195 with 9+1 courses. The restaurant was only about 50% full on a Sunday.  The food was quite tasty and service was good.  The deep-fried oyster was the best testing I've ever had.  See my photos. The photos of the interior were taken on a Sunday 6:15pm where it was only about 30% full."}
