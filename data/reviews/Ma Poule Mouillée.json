{"text":"OmGoodness, well at first you think you are gonna be waiting in line forever but it moves rather quickly. The portions here are humongous so beware of what size you order. I have never had Portuguese food and let me tell you, now I am a big fan. The guy behind the counter could tell I was from \"outta town\" he was very helpful with our order. The Poutine had chicken and sweet sausage on top which was very good. The chicken plate was huge, what I would consider half a chicken they consider 1/4. So be prepared to take some home."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices and very good food! We had the 1/4 chicken (Nr.4) that comes with fries. and salad, we also had a chicken sandwich with salad (Nr.5). We paid 17$ and very stuffed afterwards. The salad had a very decent and delicious dressing. The chicken already has a smoky taste and can be ordered with a slightly spicy sauce.  Afterwards be ordered a Pastel de Nata and we can say that it tastes exactly like in Portugal. Nice place!"}
{"text":"Pas cher du tout. Bon rapport qualité prix. Le poulet est un peu trop gras vs piri piri"}
{"text":"Just go! WOW! Portions are huge, prices are so cheap! 11$ tax in for half a chicken meal.  The.best.portugueuse.chicken.i.ever.tried.  I could talk about the fries, salad, service, blah blah blah, just go FFS!"}
{"text":"Great moist succulent inexpensive chicken! They make great fries and a delicious hot sauce. I used to be a chef and i saw, on the other side of the counter, that the owner Tony serves great food without cutting corners. Also, they make pastries 100% butter. He told me that he doesn't use hydrogenated fat. After tasting his croissant and chocolatine, i believe him. This makes his natas' crust crunchy as well. It's not the Toqué but for a chicken+fries place in which you can have a meal under 10$, it's fresh, properly cooked and no cutter corners and tastes great. Try it."}
{"text":"Your first bite will make you stop to appreciate what you're eating. Very tasty chicken, fantastic fries, nice salad. Huge portions! I did have to pull out some cartilage and bone left in my chicken sandwich, but it's a small annoyance for an over all good meal."}
{"text":"there's a new (Portuguese) sheriff in town. Full respect to a certain other Portuguese rotisserie, down on the west end of Rachel-- but Ma Poule has their game on tight.   Smoky charred chicken, glorious potatoes, tasty fries, sweet-sweet nata... By no means have the (super friendly) team here re-invented the wheel, they've just fine-tuned it, pumped it full of air and put some nice new rims on it.   Didn't try their poutine or anything more elaborate-- just stuck with the basics-- which, as it turns out, were anything but.   My new Portuguese chicken jam."}
{"text":"Fan du resto, avant j'allais à la banquise pour un quickfix de fastfood. Maintenant, Ma Poule, c'est là ou je vais! Portion hyper généreuse à prix modique. La poutine avec le chorizo est très bonne. Le petit combo du sandwich talbot est parfait pour un lunch rapide, seulement 7$. Le combo véronique est assez généreux pour que deux personnes puisse, diner/souper à seulement 10-11$. Vraiment chouette ce petit resto de quartier, je vous le conseil fortement, même avant la fameuse banquise."}
{"text":"We got the half chicken and no lie the portion was crazy big.  Shared it with my husband.  The chicken was juicy and delicious!  Also don't forget the Portuguese egg tarts!"}
{"text":"L'assiette de poulet est tellement bonne!! Surtout avec une sauce epicee! Je le recommande! Grosse assiette et vraiment pas cher! Seule chose... Il manque de la place un peu pour s'asseoire mais une bonne ambiance quand meme. Style takeout, rapide!"}
{"text":"Crap!  What's the big attraction?  I come all the way from Vancouver, ignored the many recommendations of places in the area rated superbe by friends... Crossage a main mouette is my translation   I walked by at noon, lineup out front around the corner. So I came back after my meeting at around 13:30. (That's 1:30pm in English). Lined up outside for about 20 minutes. I'm thinking it's gotta be good! The 1/2 chicken was, like, warm and short a thigh, this may account for the reasonable price, which would have been reasonable had I gotten a half chicken.  I got enough fries for 4 peoples. Was this to hide the missing chicken, or because they thought giving me more of the dredges from the bottom of the bowl would make up for not having hot, fresh fries? Then the salad, it looks so good, fresh, huge turnover ensures freshness.  Until you put 1/4 cup or so.of.dressing... by the time I got to a picnic table in Parc Lafontaine the beautiful salad is so drenched it's running down the street... nuff said, ripped OFF!"}
{"text":"J'ai l'impression qu aucune des personnes qui ont émis un avis super positif sur \"la poule mouillee\" n' ont été vraiment au Portugal ou du moins goûté des plats authentiques portugais. J y etais aujourd'hui avec ma petite amie portugaise qui a été scandalisée tout comme moi. La seule chose vraiment portugaise dans ce Resto c est la quantité! Oui la cuisine portugaise est généreuse! Mais mis à part Ca rien ne ressemble au \"frango churrasco\" du Portugal! Sauce piri piri trop abondante, normalement on ne fait q passer un pinceau avec la sauce sur la viande.. Le poulet ne nage pas dans une sauce orangeâtre... Deuxièmement ce choruriço a très peu de ressemblance avec le vrai chouriço du Portugal et pour finir, sur ce qui est pourtant généralement le plus simple à réaliser, les salades portugaises sont toujours assaisonnés au plus simple: cad huile d olive, sel et vinaigre de vin et non cette vinaigrette industrielle à la soit disant moutarde :-/ En conclusion il y a de la quantité mais pas de qualité."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, cheap.  It was highly recommended by our Airbnb hosts.  We were not dissapointed.  The poutine was good but the little potato balls (recommended by friendly server dude) were the best.  5 out of 5 little potato balls."}
{"text":"Very nice place . Fabulous chicken , not to expensive and give a lot for your money !!!"}
{"text":"We read about this place and knew it was the right spot when we saw the diverse clientele lunching happily. Two sandwiches, pork and chicken, with side salads and repas, and two drinks came to just over $20, a terrific value anywhere, but unbelievable given the quality and flavor here. The chicken sandwich is the winner, although the pork was delicious, too. The chicken is perfectly seasoned and chopped. It goes down almost too easily. The repas were new to us and a nice change from fries. The side portions were so generous that we could not finish them. I would've sprinkled a but more salt on before we left the shop for the park, but they were otherwise delicious."}
{"text":"Fantastic chicken and the prices are great. Try the chicken and chorico combo, make sure u go spicy and you will be in heaven."}
{"text":"We came here after a friend's recommendation. Their portions are very generous and the poutine was really tasty - we liked the poutine here more than La Banquise across the road (famous/popular with tourists).  The chips were crunchy, chicken was super moist with a great gravy! La Banquise's chips were soggy by comparison.  We also had the chicken salad and half a chicken between the four of us (without the sides, you need to specify without sides otherwise they'll pile on chips and some salad - super generous portions like I said).  It was more than enough, we struggled to finish the three dishes! There was a little bit of a line - but I think it depends on the time of day you go as there wasn't a line when we lined up for Banquise on a previous day.    A great option if there isn't any seating available is to get take-away and eat it at La Fontaine Park just up the road about half a block across the road - beautiful spot!  Would definitely have come back if we had more time in Montreal and stomach space!"}
{"text":"I went with some acquaintances and we all had a great time. The chicken was really good and affordable. When I went, there were a lot of people, so maybe not as quiet if we had wanted a more quiet location. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for an afternoon snack after walking around La Fontaine Park. We ordered the small poutine (our 5th sample of poutine in 4 days) and were not disappointed! The chorizo, chicken (w/ crispy skin) and spicy sauce are amazing - definitely the best poutine combination we had during our trip to Montreal. We'll definitely come back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Excellent rapport qualité-prix. L'endroit est parfait pour luncher sans vouloir trop dépenser.   Essayer la poutine avec chorizo et poulet...vous ne le regrettez pas!"}
{"text":"In one word: amazing. First time in Montreal and had lots of recommendations for this place, did not disappoint at all! I ordered both the 1/2 chicken (#2 on the menu) and the large poutine (#8). While the chicken was as good as everyone here said, the poutine takes the cake. For one the serving portion is absolutely huge so it's easily splittable between 2-3 people; and two, it's toppled with chicken and chorizo which makes it super tasty. Well-priced too at around $12 for the large poutine. Only caution is this is a well-known gem and so seems pretty packed regularly."}
{"text":"AMAZZZINGGG menu options! Was a tourist visiting montreal and really wanted to have something casual and local. So glad I dropped by. There was a short lineup when I arrived but it went quickly and the line started to run out the door to the corner after we got our food. HUGE portions at very affordable price. I had the chorizo and chicken platter that came with frites and salad and it did not disappoint. Felt so satisfied and full, I went for a walk at the fontaine park nearby."}
{"text":"Easily the BEST Portuguese chicken spot in the city. It blows all others (yes, Romados, even you) out of the water.  The chicken.... it's incredible. Charbroiled and juicy. The fries/potatoes/salad are delicious as well.   Great ambiance, it's always very busy but worth the wait. Their poutine is a must eat.... do yourself a favour and try it!   Nice baked goods as well and affordable. Winning all around."}
{"text":"Superbly tender, incredibly juicy, and just delicious chicken.  You get an insanely large amount of food and its inexpensive. When we went the place was packed so seating can be a bit of a challenge and a little bit of a wait time. My advice, call in your order for pick up to beat the lines.   As for the food, my group ordered the poutine with chicken and a half chicken with fries and salad. For the four of us we still had a ton of food and had to take it home. The hot sauce (similar to peri peri sauce) and the vinaigrette for the salad were great and I wished I purchased a bottle or two to bring home.  Great place to try with friends."}
{"text":"Same crew every time i go, which means that the owner takes good care of them. In my opinion that usually equates the team taking good care of the customer. And they do. Very nice and prompt service. Not gonna say much about the excellent chicken. Besides saying that it is juicy and very good. How do you know that a place makes good chicken? First it stays juicy if you eat left overs the following days. Second it's so good to don't have left overs. I love their pastries because they are affordable AND tasty Love this place"}
{"text":"Franchement pas bon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Je déconseille à 1000%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Ils y a des meilleurs références à Montreal !!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Un endroit parfait pour le lunch.   On peut manger sur place en prenant un plateau comme à la cafétéria ou pour emporter dans une petite boîte en carton.   Les repas sont à maximum 13$ et offrent des sandwichs aux cotelettes de porc, du poulet à la sauce portugaise, etc. Le tout servi avec de délicieuses frites et salade toute simple. Un petit conseil, pour le poulet, on vous demandera \"sauce douce ou piquante?\" dites douce parce que si la douce est aussi piquante, je n'imagine pas la forte!   Pour 9$, j'ai eu une bonne cuisse, un pilon, une salade, des frites et un 7up!   Petit hic? Le personnel ne parle pas très bien français et il est parfait difficile de se comprendre.  L'endroit vend également des pâtisseries dont les pasteis de nata, un classique portugais. Derrière la caisse se trouve également un présentoir des pains qu'ils vendent: 2,50 pour 6 petits pains parfaits pour vos sandwichs!   Bref, un endroit parfait pour le lunch."}
{"text":"Pretty good nice portion  I had the Louis cyr shared with my mom and I have leftovers.My boyfriend had the small poutine wasn't small he have leftovers too.The only complaint is maybe a little more salt but I like my food salty!"}
{"text":"I received recommendation from a co-workers about their famous portuguese poutine. I came here with a friend. What surprise me first was the concept. Order first, pay, then sit and eat. We ordered the portuguese poutine and 1/2 chicken to try it out.  The small poutine was more than enough. Good price. The sauce, quality of crispy fries and delicious chicken inside made a huge difference.  For the half chicken, the chicken was cook in a way that made it tasty and the sauce on it was amazing.  Great food for take-out or eat for lunch. Very filling. You have for your money. I wouldn't recommend for a date. The place is small and crowded quickly.  My friend also tried the mango nectar juice which was amazing.  Strongly recommend if you are hungry!"}
{"text":"Un peu long l'attente en ligne mais ça vaut la peine.  Poulet et bifanas succulent et service hors pair!"}
{"text":"Omgggg je n'ai jamais mangé un poulet grillé aussi bon! ils sont juste parfait! Leur Poutine est magique! FONCEZ"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken! They fill up your plate pretty well and everything is delicious. The only thing I disliked is the fact that there definitely aren't enough tables for the amount of people that comes in."}
{"text":"You gotta go!! We got number 2 and 4. The fries and chicken were delicious. Must have with hot sauce. CAUTION: the portions are huge so make try to share the plates if you can! Also - the Portuguese egg tarts should be mandatory desserts."}
{"text":"The chicken here is so so good !! There's usually a line that moves rather slowly, but it's so worth it !  Their portions are huge at reasonable prices - I've had the 1/4 chicken, which comes with a huge serving of fries and a side salad. The chicken is super tender and tasty and wonderfully flavored. Their poutine is amazing as well - The chicken pieces are super succulent, and it's not as heavy as I thought it'd be (YAY). The poutine also contains pieces of sausage, and of course, the usual ingredients of cheese curds, gravy, and fries.  Basically, check this place out! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Favourite BBQ chicken place  Poutine w chicken  Salad with chicken  Great deserts   Stop by the Orage Clothing showroom just east on Rachel and have lunch after you buy some of the coolest outdoor functional gear   Double two thumbs up review"}
{"text":"Nom nom nomm  Poule Mouillée on our first date, Poule Mouillée on our anniversary, Poule Mouillée on our wedding night? .. I would bathe in a jacuzzi of their gravy.  What?"}
{"text":"Better than Romados. Ill start with that. Classic portugese style chicken spot.   My first visit I got the poutine with chorizo, chicken and other meats. It was 5/5 delicious. Pure glutton. Every bite was perfect. I got a small and could have easily shared it with another person. Get large if you have 3 people or your alone and want a heart attack.   My second visit was at 9pm on a weekday night, thy close at 10. Food and service was still good. $10 for a 1/4 chicken dinner with fries and salad. Delicious, crispy chicken. Hot sauce is on the tangy side which I prefer over oily side.   Their portugese egg tarts are also good. Get one, or 5!"}
{"text":"Très bon poulet portugais tendre et juteux servie avec frites et salade excellent sauce"}
{"text":"Wonderful. The chourico was wonderful and had great BBQ flavour. The chicken was flavourful as well. The sauce was spicy and not greasy. Wish that the salad had more tomatoes and other vegetables, it was too lettuce heavy for me. The fries were great as well. The prices were fair. Definitely a fan... a big fan! Oh and the nata was good too! A definitely great choice on a budget!"}
{"text":"5 stars on value alone! Prices are great and so are the portions. Poutines come with chicken and chorizo on it and is only 7$ tax in for a generous portion although its only a \"small\". I dont recommend the sandwiches though as I find their choice of bread not to be the best. I do have to say I dont feel that great after eating here but I do crave it from time to time. The chicken is atleast as good or better than Romados."}
{"text":"I was told by no less than four friends that they'd disown me if I didn't eat here while in Montreal, and I can now see why. I ordered the 1/4 chicken with frites and salad, and managed to finish about half. The portions are completely insane - listen to your fellow Yelpers when they tell you you'll need to split the poutine with someone (my three friends split a small!). The chicken is AMAZING, so moist and delicious, and the spicy sauce is perfect, especially when it mixes with the garlicky salad dressing and peppery frites. I heard how crazy busy it got during the lunch hour, so we went around 3 pm on a Wednesday and had no wait time. Run, don't walk, and thank me later."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my 1st visit but will not be my last. I took 2 X LE LOUIS CYR, dined with Mom. It was only 2-3 minutes from me giving my order to me paying and walking out the door. I took 2 pcs. of the strudel & a passionfruit Sumol.  I much prefer the way they pack the take out orders over Romados, they box the salad separately so it doesn't end up wilted by the time I get home. Every bit as tasty the same price, better service and way, way quicker. Not nearly as much choice of sweets but when I go for chicken I'm after chicken."}
{"text":"Loved it. Chicken was amazing and super cheap! The hot sauce was outstanding. It was a bit of a wait outside in the cold but we'll worth it. We will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Our poutine was DELICIOUS! Full of yummy chunks of chicken and sausage. We ordered a small plate and shared a small sandwich which had a nice kick to it.  Price was right and seating was nice and bright. Highly recommend dining here."}
{"text":"This place has the best poutine in town. This is evident from the long lines and the bustling crowd at this place. We came here in Canada day 2018 and found the place full despite the heat and lack of ventilation. Amazing poutine just sealed the deal for me."}
{"text":"Came here to pick up some food. Let me say that the chicken is tender and juicy !  I also picked up a large poutine and it was soooo good. Their fries are not soggy, and their poutine sauce is amazing !  The staff is very friendly and welcoming !"}
{"text":"First time having poutine, and it was a great first experience. Word to the wise, the petit poutine is plenty to share between 2-3 people. I would come back after having a few drinks :)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a huge portion of delicious, moist Portuguese style chicken, this is the place.  I'm not sure if I'll put this above Romados, but it is still extremely good.  Tons of Chicken, tons of fries, classic Portuguese pastries. The poutine is also fantastic with chicken, hot sauce and Chorizo."}
{"text":"The best Portuguese Rotisserie Chicken!! Huge  portions and unbelievable deals here. As soon as you walk in the door, you smell the aroma of BBQ grilled chicken. You can see racks of chicken in the Rotisserie.   This is a small eatery with counter type service. A small eating area with a few tables and counter seating.  A half chicken dinner with 3 sides for only $11. The portions were so big... it's enough for sharing. A whole chicken a la carte is only $14. The chicken is so tasty and even the white meat is juicy & tender. This chicken is amazing..."}
{"text":"Its simply delicious and great service. The portions are huge  and the price is very reasonable. Had pastel de nata for the first time and it was really yummy. We had the veronique plate and again, so so good"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best Portugese chicken spots in Montreal.  The portions are crazy big so it's best to bring friends and split plates."}
{"text":"I had originally walked to this area to go to La Banquise for poutine but changed my mind because A, it was raining and B, there was a long line outside the place. Luckily this restaurant was across the street! Strategic placement? Perhaps. My boyfriend had the combo plate with chorizo and rotisserie chicken which he thought was a bit salty. I had the pork shoulder sandwich with fries and loved every bite! The spicy sauce was so good that I bought some to bring home."}
{"text":"Cela fait une semaine que c'est ouvert. Résultat, c'est très sympa pour y luncher! De plus, situé à côté du parc Lafontaine, c'est l'idéal pour une petite balade avant pour se donner l'appétit ou après pour digérer.  La grillade de poulet est au rendez-vous, mais un poisson du jour est aussi à la carte. C'est servi avec patates, légumes ou frites. J'étais un peu septique sur le coup, mais en y goutant, bonne surprise ce fut très bon.   Je met 3 étoiles, car j'ai été un peu déçue par le cadre. Tables et chaises peu confortables, peu nombreuses, peu pratiques...   Ils proposent également des pâtisseries pour les gourmands et des petits pains à sandwich faits maison. Le prix est très aborsables, car pour 6 petits pains vous vous en sortez pour 2.50$."}
{"text":"Chicken tastes great. Big portions. Cheap prices.  Well worth the wait!   Seating is a bit limited. But tables turn pretty quickly."}
{"text":"The poutine and chicken here are out of the world. One of the best restaurants in Montreal for fire roasted chicken and poutine. The portions are enormous. My boyfriend and I ordered one regular chicken and sausage poutine and we couldn't even finish it. Would always return when I am in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Excellent value for delicious food. Ordered the large chorizo/chicken poutine to share between two of us, and still couldn't finish it off. Will come again!"}
{"text":"Chick-chick picante was good. I enjoyed the food and the staff were friendly...I heard a bunch of languages being spoken so there is that too."}
{"text":"On devait aller initialement à la Banquise. Mais face à la queue on est rentré par hasard dans ce restaurant. C'était une super surprise. Le poulet est délicieux et les quantités plus que généreuses pour le prix. Allez-y !"}
{"text":"Great price, great food, great time!  Food: 5/5 Way to over priced. $10 for a tiny sandwich. Service: 5/5 Fast and fun. Environment: 4/5 Long line up. Nice seating. Washrooms: 4/5 Meh. Worth it?: T/5 Not worth it. Tourist trap.  This is a great local favorite. The food is wonderful and they include taxes in there prices to make everyone's life easier.   Being a first timer we got \"The Louis Cyr\" ($11) (1/2 chicken with fries and salad) and \"The Victor Medina\" ($9) (Dark 1/4 chicken with fries and salad). The portions were massive and next time for two I think a 1/3 chicken and a sandwich would do. A few couples were in sharing the 1/2 chicken.   The food is really really good. I can't really compare  it to anything. It's ok its own level. Try an egg that while you are there also!  The line up is long but goes fast. Allot of people phone in their orders and do a pick up. There is a different line up for that.   Highly recommend and will have to come back during my next Montreal Visit."}
{"text":"The first bite hit me like a truck speeding down the Interstate.  The smooth chicken and fries drizzled with cheese and topped with sauce was undeniably indulgent.  It was my first experience of poutine even though it was my 3rd time in Montreal.  They do love their poutine: I'm talking shirts, shot glasses, the works with poutine-inspired swag.  The only issue with the dish is that each component erred on the salty side.  The individual bites won't be bad at all; you'll think it's bursting with flavor.  However, as you delve into the halfway point, it'll get to be too much.   The staff is great- both front and back of house.  The guys cooking the chicken were very friendly and patient with me.  My French is abysmal, and the cook communicated with me in fluent English.  The ladies in the back who handled the pastries and cashier area, however, did not.  It was all lost in translation, but it wasn't a problem since I guessed what was what.    I usually don't like ordering chicken in restaurants unless it's fried.  Most places tend to produce dry meat.  The Portuguese chicken here was anything but.  However, it was topped with a large heap of fries which were over-browned and soggy from the sauce.  Eating it all together took away from the moistness of the chicken.    If I had 4 friends to eat this with, it would probably receive higher marks.  I rate food based on whether I can AND want to finish the entire dish.  I simply couldn't."}
{"text":"I will preface this by saying I'm a die hard fan of Romados. Portuguese chicken is just phenomenal when you're craving something quick and hearty. When I heard I could get it after 8pm (Ma Poule Mouillée closes at 10pm week nights) I couldn't wait to try it.  I've now been twice to Ma Poule Mouillée and it lives to its hype. The portions are enormous it has to be one of the best bank for your buck meals! You order at the counter from one of the chalkboard menu items. Everything I've tried and seen there is delicious! The spicy sauce for the chicken is delicious and packed with flavour.   Tip: they take phone orders so you can cut the line if you plan ahead."}
{"text":"I love this place. Hands down the best place in town for Portugese chicken (I find that Romados is more oily and the chicken is a bit too dry for my liking). I always get their poutine and it's so good!! The small is only $9 and it's enough to for two/three people or you could eat the whole thing by yourself. They slather on gravy and this other homemade sauce that is so delicious, then cover the fries with giant cheese curds, chorizo and chicken. It's too die for!!!! Do yourself a favour and come here and grab a pastel de nata at the same time (portuguese egg tart)."}
{"text":"Both the chicken and pork sandwich are amazing deals! Only around 6 canadian dollars each stuffed with plenty of delicious meat that they cook in front of you. The bread is great (crisp outside, fluffy inside) and the sauce they use adds a nice flavor to the sandwich. Highly recommend this place for a well-priced, quick eat."}
{"text":"ce que j'ai aimé la première fois que je suis allé a ma poule mouillée c'est le fait que le menu soit simple , efficace et rond , pour 10 $ un demi poulet une *shit load * de frites ainsi qu'une petite salade  juste pour  dire , j'ai pas mangé là-bas ( ambiance assez decontracté et nouvelle de ce que j'ai vu ) mais c'est a coté du parc lafontaine et avec une petite bière un samedi après-midi ensoleillé du poulet pour pas cher , ca ne se refuse pas"}
{"text":"Love this place. So do my kids and anyone else I bring here. Food quality is high and the deliciousness factor incomparable to other grilled chicken joints. I also think the Louis Cyr is the best meal you can get for 10$. Just a great deal, quality establishment, and consistency. An instant Montreal favorite."}
{"text":"There was no way we were going to line up in the -20 windchill today for brunch at La Banquise, so we crossed the street to Ma Poule Mouillée.  Food was plentiful and was pretty good. I'm a fan of spicy foods and was a bit disappointed to find that their hot sauce had no kick at all. The chicken was lacking the smoky flavour of some of the better rotisserie portugaise places in Montreal. But it was pretty good, a solid three stars. To give you an idea of serving size, we went skating after lunch and even then, six hours later, we aren't all that interested in having supper.  They've obviously put some thought itno the ambiance with a brick wall counter, wood trim, and bright red, black and white colours. Menu items have playful names. The staff was friendly. The bathroom was clean."}
{"text":"Amazing food! And very friendly staff. I got the half spicy chicken with salad and rice and I literally want to eat here every single day!!!"}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs restaurant de poulet portugais a mon avis   et pour ma part meilleurs service et goût que le légendaire Ramados que j'adore également mais qui après avoir essayer ma poule mouillé et tombe bon deuxième. Premièrement le décors est chaleureux et il y a plusieurs endroit où s'asseoir pour manger. Les portion son gigantesque la poutine avec chorizo est quasi-impossible à finir seul et les frites ne sont jamais sec , salade est très bonnne et le plus important les natas sont délicieuse les meilleurs disponible en restaurant . Malgré l'énorme achalandage le service est rapide le midi il y a toujours un énorme line-up alors peut être éviter d'y aller a cet heure là. Mon restaurant préfére où ameneres amis qui veulent du bon poulet a la brasa."}
{"text":"Best poutine in the city. Great prices and a ton of food. One of the best Portuguese chicken joints in the city."}
{"text":"We went there on Friday night so the place was full of people for taking away. We 4 people ordered 2 Portuguese grilled chicken, poutine with chicken on it, chicken salad. That was way too much for su to finish even though we were so hungry! So  in terms of the portion i have nothing to say.  Grilled chickens were good and had a flavor, but were little dry, I think maybe because they were on oven, it rolling on the stove for long time after they're finished.  Poutine, everyone seems to love it including my friends going there but I didn't really get why people were raving so much about it... well this is not bad whatsoever, but the gravy sauce, I really didn't love it, was little too salty and a luck of aroma (?) I guess, and I honestly don't have much experience of tasting Poutine in my life ( this was my 2nd time) but I just thought that the chicken on it was really dry and the cheese should have been more melted to feel that's tasty..?, because cheese on it was really raw and cold. I Don't know, maybe that's normal and that's the cheese on Poutine should be but still, I think it'd be lot tastier if the cheese is melted on it.  Salad was good, I liked the dressing on it. Overall, well as a not-crazy-Poutine-lover, I really don't think i'm coming back."}
{"text":"Chicken and chorizo was super juicy. Poutine is delicious. The line up to order was really long but the good is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Sympathique rôtisserie portugaise rue Rachel. Le chef est un ancien du Romados - d'ailleurs, même bon goût mais sans line up (du moins pour l'instant, ça vient d'ouvrir).   On y va bien sur pour le poulet portugais a la broche, mais aussi pour le chouriço ! Sans oublier les pasteis de natas :)"}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place so my friend and I went to check it out yesterday.  Conclusion first: it's good.  I think it's at the same level of Romados. The chicken was great. I like the potatoes better than the fries.  My friend tried the poutine. I like the poutine as well. Big portion, flavored meat, good cheese curds and plenty of sauce. But I've never tried the poutine at Romados so I cannot really compare.  However, I do think that this place used less oil than Romados. If you want a cheat meal but still feel guilty about it, it is a better choice."}
{"text":"Just called tonight for take-out and simply asked the woman on the phone if the chicken sandwich was a club chicken sandwich and what was in it. She yelled at me saying it was too busy for her to answer my questions and she hung up on me!! Very rude. Will never do business here again!!"}
{"text":"After a truly lousy snack at Carrefour Laval, I was set on eating some real food.  We headed downtown to check out the festivals this weekend and detoured to this place since I had it bookmarked.  The value: unbelievable!  Prices include tax which makes things a whole lot easier.  Totally worth the price even if it wasn't included!    The portions: insane!  The plates are piled high and overflowing!  The food: delicious!  Fries were so unique!  It was like eating a cross between chips and fries and I didn't want to stop eating them.  The chicken was tender and moist, the skin was thin and crisp, and the sauce had a good level of spice.  The salad was fresh and I enjoyed the dressing.  I would come back here for sure!  No doubt about it!  Everyone should come here!!!"}
{"text":"Who knew Peruvian food in Canada was so good? The chicken melts off the bone and is incredibly tender and flavorful. The fries are cripsy and delicious. A quarter chicken can feed 2 people so its a great deal! The line can get a bit long but it moves at a moderately ok pace. I didn't order the poutine but it looked incredible and massive and if I was in Montreal longer I would have gone back to try the poutine."}
{"text":"Next time instead of La Banquise check out this gem across the street. Ma Poule Mouillée, the portugese place right across the street makes some of the best poutine I have had, with chicken and chorizo is #blessed. Does the hashtag make be basic?"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price! This was one of the best places my husband and I visited on our trip. The spicy sauce they put on the chicken tasted a lot like buffalo sauce but better. The pastries are also yummy if you have room."}
{"text":"A local favourite and I can see why! The chicken is roasted in house and super flavorful. They obviously specialize in chicken but the portion sizes are big and the prices are good. For $11, you can get a half chicken, fries and salad (Louis Cyr dish) or for $9 you can get a quarter chicken with fries and a salad! The Natas (Portuguese egg tarts) are also a must try ($1.50 each).   What's great about the chicken joint is that all the prices include tax already so whatever price you see, is what you're paying for. They do tend to have quite the line up but trust me, it's well worth the wait since the food is not only flavorful but plentiful.   They have seats inside as well as a small patio outside -- first come first serve after you order and wait for your food. I would say they are quite efficient given the line up and also very friendly! I would definitely return to try the chicken sandwich!"}
{"text":"Got acquainted with this morning Montréal tradition that lunch today. I saved my appetite for hours and was extremely well rewarded with the Portuguese chicken poutine. Also got the salad to balance the meal out with some non potato veg. The chorizo was a pleasant surprise and seating wasn't an issue, although we had to wait in line for a bit. Pricing was fair and the charcoal infused rotisserie chicken I watched rotating on a huge spit was a feast for the eyes!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOD. Rollover La Banquise. There is a new poutine king in town. MA Poule Mouillée's poutine is salty, meaty, savory perfection. It comes topped with both Portuguese chicken and chorizo. They are incredibly generous with the cheese curds.  The gravy is dense, and you can taste the chicken skin spices in it.  The poutine was one of the best things I ever ate in my life. My mouth salivates when I think about it. As I write this review, I am simultaneously trying to book an AirBnB so I can come back for it.   Other then poutine- you can  order chicken sandwiches or 1/4, 1/2 or full sized chickens. Their chicken is delicious - super juicy and tender. 1/4 and 1/2 sized chickens come with salad and fries.   Everything here tastes better with beer. I can't think of a better late night snack then Ma Poule Mouillée's  poutine or chicken."}
{"text":"Love this place every time I am in Montreal.  The food is great. Chicken is super flavorful and moist."}
{"text":"This place offers a different kind of poutine. It had chourico and chicken added to the fries, gravy and cheese. The line was a tad bit too long but that is everywhere you go. The flavor combination was delish however some of the cheese was not melted so it wasn't very appetizing."}
{"text":"THEY. WILL. FEED. YOU.  Romados' little cousin won't disappoint. Phone your order ahead of time so you feel like boss when you walk past the line to the front."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!!  Came down from Mont Temblant and we were starving and craving some delicious Montreal poutine. We were torn between this place and the location across the street which is known for its poutine. When we arrived we saw the huge line across the street so we decided to instead check out ma poule mouillee. We literally made the best decision ever !!! The poutine was beyond killer delicious (get the small it's huge and plenty for two people). We also got a half chicken plate with rice and a salad and their hot sauce which again was delicious. The line moved quick and we got a seat and could not believe how delicious all the food was.  Juicy roasted chicken and fresh salad on one side and crispy french fries topped with pulled chicken and spiced chorizo with fresh cheese smothered in gravy and hot sauce. We literally could not have been happier. Btw the line across the street hadn't moved at all since we sat down to eat. #winning . Go here, end of story :)"}
{"text":"Came to this place on a recommendation that it's cheap, tasty, and huge portions. It was raining outside, but there was still a small line leading out the door. The other option was a fondue place across this street and this poutine place with 100 people in line, so we decided to stick with this option. And it was an excellent choice.  This restaurant is pretty much self service. Enter, place an order, proceed down the counter to pickup your order. One section for walk-in, another section for phone orders. Just look at the signs hanging from the ceilings for instructions. Don't forget to grab a jug of water and some cups. You should also clean up when you're done.  Getting a table might be a bit tricky. We were fortunate that a family was finishing up. You might consider just getting it to go if you know a place to sit down.  Their specialty is Portuguese roasted chicken. You can see their kitchen with 50 chickens on the grill at the same time. You can get chicken on its own, or with fries and salad. They also offer chorizo as well as poutine that comes with their chicken.  The chicken is really cheap. You can get half a chicken on its own for $11, or a whole chicken on its own for $14. Talk about upsizing, why would you not get the whole chicken? We had three legs, wings, thighs, and a back. Or something like that. Meat was very tender and juicy, and the marinating was amazing.   They have a basic poutine for $8, or you can get their deluxe poutine for $13 for this massive plate of poutine filled with potatoes, chicken, cheese curds, chorizo, and their special gravy. Do not underestimate the size of the poutine, you can probably split it between 3 or 4 people easily. Comes with a lot of chunks of chicken as well. Definitely worth trying.  I later found out that the poutine place across the street had over 1000 yelp reviews, but whatever, you will not be disappointed coming here. Well, maybe if you were looking for somewhere romantic."}
{"text":"Portuguese Chicken Rotisseries are a popular bargain eatery in Montreal.  Romados and Ma Poule Mouillée are two of the most popular with crowds throughput the day.    We stopped by Ma Poule Mouillée at 4:45 pm and sure enough there still was a crowd and line, although not as long as nearby Poutine spot L'Banquise.   Many people order by telephone to skip the lines and many also opt for take-out as the seating is fairly limited for how popular the spot is.  Menus are all in French, but it's pretty easy to figure out what to order as the most popular items are the 1/2 or 1/4 chicken with fries and salad or the Poutine.  Staff are friendly and able to handle orders in English as there are plentiful tourists here too.   Upon entering, you have a nice view of the kitchen and see racks of chicken rotating in the rotisserie and loads of potatoes being deep fried into fries. Our order:  Whole Chicken - $15. I opted for the whole chicken as I didn't feel like a house salad or more fries given I was also ordering the Poutine.  I asked if I could have all dark meat but I'm not sure they understood, but I did get a lot of thigh meat.  The chicken is moist and flavorful with a great skin and a nice sauce (spicy or normal) that they add on afterwards.  In some ways, this is like a Costco Chicken and I mean that in a good way.   Poutine - $12. While the chicken is good, the Poutine is what puts this place over the top and past any Costco.  It's a huge portion (also available in small) of freshly fried fries, covered with delicious fresh cheese curds, topped with rotisserie chicken, Portuguese chouriço and a special house sauce(if you want everything) and then smothered in hot brown gravy.   It's a caloric and salt bomb but I loved it.  I was worried the fries would get soggy but they expertly put the cheese curd to absorb most of the heat and melt as well as the meats.  I didn't care as much for the sausage but this is one of the best poutines I've had even with that.   Portuguese egg tarts - they have a whole dessert and baked goods section that you order at the cashier after you bring your chicken items to the front.  We opted for the Portuguese egg tarts and they were beautiful.  I've had these many times with the Macau influence on Hong Kong bakeries but this more traditional Portuguese version is sweeter with a super flakey and crispy crust.  Worth ordering.   Soup - $3. This is a new item and i was secretly hoping for a clear broth like at Portland's Nong's Khao Man Gai.  Instead it's a creamy soup broth with bits of chicken, carrot and more. I'd say this is skippable.   Overall, this is a bargain spot in Montreal.  The portions are huge, the food (especially the Poutine) tasty and delicious, and the variety enough to make this a good stop if you have a few days in Montreal.  Just prepare to wait and go off hours as they have continuous hours.    Ma Poule Mouillée accepts credit cards including Amex."}
{"text":"Been in town two days, already been there twice (and waiting on my third visit tomorrow before we fly home!)."}
{"text":"Legend has it that the the owner of the place used to work for Romados before the fire two years ago. Actually it's barely a secret. And so to answer the burning question of who's best, I personally think Ma Poule Mouillée comes out winner with the same huge plates of fries, salad, and piri-piri chicken. The difference is one of consistency: I've always had tender juicy seasoned-just-right chicken over here while Romados can be a game of dry & over-salted roulette. Although my sample is a bit skewed with only a couple portuguese chicken meals at Ma Poule Mouillée compared to twice-a-week visits to Romados in my last life. I mean at $10 a plate who isn't tempted to go back again and again? Then there comes a point where you'll have had way too many portuguese chicken meals to want to eat that again. That's why I think grilled seafood at Ma Poule Mouillée is genius. The chicken-chouriço poutine has great flavour combinations and the large ($12) can legitimately feed two hungry wolves. If only the people who line up at La Banquise across the street knew...  Small details like serving food on a real plate also add to the value (not that pilling a Styrofoam takeout box can't be an experience on its own - it just gets old and impractical fast). Not to mention Ma Poule Mouillée is trendier, cheaper than the average portuguese chicken restaurant and has outdoor seating during the summer. Tony Alves improved what is already great.  Update 1 (2015-11-26): I had the steak plate today - not sure if it's a daily special or something on the regular menu. It was a modest piece (probably 6-8oz), cooked to a very nice medium-well over charcoal. However I wasn't a fan of the gravy which looked a lot of poutine sauce. Neither of the egg. Overall just salty and lacked spices. I would stick with the grilled calamari plate if your'e looking for a break from chicken."}
{"text":"Wow, sooo good! Took the recommendation of last nights Uber driver and he was so spot on. Very happy we tried this spot!"}
{"text":"Solid place for Portuguese chicken. I much prefer it to Romados for a variety of reasons: the interior is cuter and has more seating, the prices include tax and last time I compared it with Romados, I think Ma Poule came out slightly cheaper (not sure if it's still the case, since I noticed a few weeks ago that some items at Ma Poule increased in price by a dollar or so), and most importantly, Ma Poule has juicier chicken which does better the next day. I always found Romados to be very dry and not enjoyable the following day. I also like how Poule packs the side salad in its own box to save you from having drenched and soggy fries if you do take out. I used to hate taking Romados home, because the fries would be covered in dressing, and the chicken was usually packed rather carelessly. I also think Poule has slightly better fries, although they're still not what I call great (but you come here for spicy chicken!). I also want to note that I generally do not like poutine and avoid it everywhere else, but once I tried it here, I was hooked. It's definitely a great combo of spicy chicken, salty chorizo and salty sauce with decently fresh cheese curd. I would definitely pick this poutine over any other at La Banquise which is across the street. The small poutine can feed two easily and I don't suggest the large unless you have a massively massive appetite. Overall, a great place for a cheap, filling and happy meal!"}
{"text":"This place is so popular, the line (sometimes) goes around the building.   It's this good! The poutine \"Bon les portugais font de la poutine\" is the crowning glory of this establishment.  Take it!  Now!  The large one to go, eat half now and have a royal lunch tomorrow. Or eat half, plan to have a royal lunch tomorrow. Eat the rest.  Cry, order again."}
{"text":"Lots. Of. Food!!!  Beware. I think my husband's appetite wasn't as big as he thought when we came here.  We ended up getting the 1/2 chicken plate, poutine, and a pork cutlet sandwich.  All came with a lot of fries  The chicken was really good but when you get to the breast part it's on the drier side. The poutine comes with chicken chunks and chorizo.  Really good!  The pork cutlet sandwich we could have done without.  I don't recommend it  Try this place out.. and definitely get the 1/2 chicken plate"}
{"text":"When I went in, well big line up! What's all the fuss about. So super busy, I can barely a see place to sit. By the time ordered, payed and got my food. Yay, we found a table. My plate looked humongous for the price I paid. The minute, I put the piece of the chicken in my mouth, I became speechless. I don't even know how to explain. Usually, I cannot finish my plate, but the taste of the food took over the fullness of my belly. Plate completely empty.Simply super duper delicious Portuguese chicken. Thank you Kathy Benfeito for recommending such a place of gem."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out banquise across the street but to my surprise every other Montrealer was feeling the same way. Instead of waiting in line my friend noticed this spot across the street where she had it at work.  Extremely fast past environment, the menu is written on a chalk board at the front of the store. They have buckets on buckets on fries and chickens being cooked 24/7.   I got a small poutine which had Portuguese chicken and chorizo, very good but needs more cheese as that's the only thing that was lacking from this wonderful flavourful meal."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by my friend who said that a line-up was pretty much expected.  The line-up started from inside the restaurant and stretched to the outside of the doors and to the sidewalk!  Luckily, we didn't have to wait too, too long and soon we were within the doors and able to see the menu.  After stepping food into the restaurant though, it still did take some time to order.  The place wasn't incredibly big and we thought it would be a better idea if I grabbed a table first while Ken got the order.  The tables were in short supply at this restaurant!  We ordered the Le Louis Cyr as my friend also said that half a chicken was more than enough for two people.  This set (of the half of their Portuguese chicken) included fries and salad too.    The Le Louis Cyr set sure didn't disappoint!  The Portuguese chicken was very tender and moist and overall it lived up to my expectations!  We wish there was a little more sauce by the end of the meal as the sauce was absolutely delicious.  Otherwise, it was definitely really good!  We also looked into the menu a little more and figured that we could have ordered the sausages too to try.  Ah well, another time.  We also surveyed what our neighbouring tables were ordering and we were so amazed with the giant poutines that we saw coming out of the kitchen!  They were huge!  We thought that it would probably feed four to six people!  Again, we'd have to try that another time with more friends with us or something.  The Portuguese Tart was not bad!"}
{"text":"Tres bon - plat du jour calamars grilles super Desserts délicieux  À recommander c est sur ! Seul bémol : manque de tables pour manger sur place sinon tout s emporté à la maison"}
{"text":"So I wasn't sure how I felt about going to another Portuguese chicken place that wasn't ramados but I had heard good things and decided to give it a try. I decided to take it to go instead of eat it there which may have contributed to my overall rating. I had a half chicken and fries and the price overall was about right. The thing I'm not sure of is the food and food quality itself. The peri peri sauce was tasty but the chicken was a bit dry. Fries didn't do well on my journey and ended up soggy and tasteless. But, like I said, this may be due to having done take out. So, I would try it again just to give it another shot but so far, not super impressed"}
{"text":"Les plats au poulet grillé les meilleurs de Montréal !!! Les prix sont très bien et les taxes sont même incluses !  L'équipe est super je recommande milles fois !!  Les places assises sont limités préférez y aller tôt !!"}
{"text":"I love portuguese chicken, and this place makes me soooo happy!  The chicken is tender and flavourful, chorizo smoky and spicy, desserts insanely tempting, etc. The fries tend to be soft and a bit soggy, but I happen to like that kind. Prices are reasonable, and the service is fast. It's usually crowded and finding a seat is nearly impossible at peak hours, so we went to Parc Lafontaine to eat - much to the squirrels' joy (seriously, they were harassing us).  Yet another fantastic food spot on Rachel street!"}
{"text":"A heart attack worth having! This place delivers a wonderful and huge serving of Portuguese chicken over fresh cheese curds and fries. There was so much flavor in their sauce, whatever it is, that I couldn't stop eating even after I was full. Went into food coma and had to take a nap dreaming about eating more of this. Definitely the best poutine in Montreal."}
{"text":"Some pretty darn delicious Portuguese Chicken! It's so tender, juicy, and flavourful. I picked this place for food pickup to eat on my birthday and my entire family loved it. We were 6 and ordered a meal each, don't do that because there will be SO MUCH FOOD LEFT. It was insane! They give you mountains of fries, 4 pieces of chicken per HALF-MEAL! We could've ordered half of what we actually got and still it would have been too much.   The fries also bathe in the chicken concoction when you get to go, so when we arrived home they were seasoned and embedded with their wonderful chicken essence.   I don't think I've ever had so much chicken in my life! It was actual torture because my mouth wanted to keep eating because it tasted so good but my stomach wanted to explode."}
{"text":"Le service est très rapide et leurs plats sont délicieux! Ce n'est vraiment pas cher pour la grosseur des plats que je n'arrive presque jamais à finir. Il fait absolument essayer leur poulet, leur poutine et leurs coin desserts par la suite. @sweet.n.salty for more"}
{"text":"So many Portuguese restaurants in the Plateau, and chose this one based on the great Yelp reviews! It did not disappoint!  We bought two half chicken meals to share between four people and we still had leftovers! The portions are insane, with the price-to-food ratio even more so.   Loved the spicy sauce on the chicken, the fries were well seasoned (perhaps a bit undercooked), and the salad really rounded out the meal. My only regret was not getting an egg tart, but I will surely be back!  Given the popularity, there is often a line, but it moves fairly quickly and is well worth it for the taste!"}
{"text":"'ve had my fair share of Portuguese chicken, but I'm always in the mood for more. It's the charred, crispy chicken skin that always makes me smile from cheek to cheek.  For me, the first bite is always, undeniably, a religious renewal of my love for chicken- an often forgotten protein in the long line of other game meat served rare to medium rare. However, when chicken is done right, it's a real experience which I don't allow to slip my fat bellied memory, ever.  As if waiting in a line to get in to the place wasn't enough proof for how amazingly delicious their food was going to be, I was welcomed by racks of chicken rotating over hot coals. Believe you me, I was beyond delighted at the spectacle of juicy chicken getting a hit of fire, smoke, and char.  The menus at Ma Poule Mouillee were in French so luckily with my grade 5 French, I was able to not only read but also understand 85% of it. What I ordered was a no brainer- the chicken and chorizo combo (combo Veronique).  Apart from the rotisserie chicken, Ma Poule Mouille also served homemade Portuguese backed desserts, like the infamous Portuguese tart. Several items to choose from, along with pickled and frozen items to complete your meal. Everything was presented nicely, conveniently and efficiently along an assembly line of ordering and paying. A definite smart setup for such a popular restaurant.  Seating wasn't ample by any stretch, but both indoor and outdoor options are available. A combination of tall wooden tables, metal stools with shorter seating created more room overall. The light wooden floors, dark wood-paneled walls, open ducts and brick counters gave Ma Poule Mouillee a homestyle vibe.  After pulling the chicken off the rack, a brush lathered the chicken in this amazingly tangy and spicy sauce before being chopped and plated. The chorizo was pulled out of the coals from below, hacked as well, followed by the most generous helping of fries placed on top. In total, the meal was $10 bucks, taxes in.  The chicken was flavorful, spicy, with hints of natural bbq char. The skin was of course the best part, but the chorizo was equally tasty, lending its spices and bold flavoring to the bed of fries underneath. It was the perfect combination, really. I didn't miss the poutine so much after my first bite, but then again, I tried that too, grabbing a forkful off my buddies gigantic poutine tin ($12 and it was up there with anyother poutine you can get in MTL).  Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better meal to send me off back home to Toronto. Montreal left a mark in my heart and belly from its intensely elaborate yet comforting food scene. I miss Montreal, leftovers made me cry."}
{"text":"La poutine est gigantesque et délicieuse, normalement je partage pas ma nourriture mais dans ce cas ci j'ai été obligée! Je ne me plains pas par contre, c'était divin!"}
{"text":"Per my cousin N's recommendation, we stopped by here with the family and had dinner here.   There was a long line for Ma Poule Mouillee. It probably took us around 30 minutes to get in.   Food is cheap here and portions are big. It was approximately 70 CAD to feed the 8 people.  I definitely recommend you stop by here if you are craving for some poutine.   We ordered the following:  - Portuguese Chicken - Chicken was delicious and the meat was tender.  - Salad Matilde (Chicken Salad) Great to share between 2 people.   - Combo Veronique (fries, salad, grilled chicken combo) Huge portion. Note that the fries that come in this combo is not the poutine ones. It's just plain fries.   - Poutine with cheese, chicken, and chorizo - This is the highlight of Ma Poule Mouillee. The poutine is slightly spicy but nothing you shouldn't be able to handle. It has a nice kick in the mouth. It's a bit on the salty side so remember to have a beverage on hand.  - Portuguese Tarts - Decided to try some Portuguese tarts per Yelp's recommendation and they were just OK. I was a little let down by this because I had such high hopes for this. This was too sweet for me. I mean like half a tart was more than enough for me. The center of the tart is very eggy and pudding like. The crust was layered but it was slightly chewy. I am not sure if the chewiness is attributed to the fact that the tart has been baked earlier in the day and sitting on the counter for a while. I actually like the Chinese Portuguese Tart from Taipan in NYC more. The Chinese version is more layered and flakier. It's has a nice crunch and it's also less sweet."}
{"text":"What I enjoyed: The portion sizes (good lawd).  The price. The magical hot sauce that they pour on (and sell separately).  The friendly service toward non-French speaking, clueless, Americans.  What I didn't enjoy: Salt, salt, and more salt - I was force feeding myself salad in between bites just to cleanse my palate."}
{"text":"Very very very very good.  I wish I found this place before! I came today to get a whole chicken to go and when I came home to bite on a piece -  joy spread through my mouth... This chicken is as good as Romados - I would need to try both simultaneously to break this tie. My impression of the restaurant itself, however, is better than Romados - the atmosphere was nicer, the place cleaner, and the food not practically thrown in your face, as done at Romados. It's also nicer to eat of a plate instead of a Styrofoam box.  Portions are as big, if not more - and I've seen people empty trays with lots of food on them - evidence to the fact that portions are even too big! Next time - I'll try their poutine - it looked very enticing."}
{"text":"Great place to get a Portuguese chicken and fries meal. Great quality for the price you pay. I would recommend it to all."}
{"text":"C'est LE meilleur poulet portugais de Montréal!!  En plus, les frites sont délicieuses !!!"}
{"text":"You know how friends from out of town always ask \"What is the best place to eat Poutine in Mtl?\" And most of the time people will say \"Go to La Banquise!\", which ironically is right across from Ma Poule Mouillee. To that question I'd answer ditch the lineup and come wait here instead (yup, lines are long here too). But it's so worth it, trust me. First of all, they don't skimp on meat. It's probably equal parts roasted Portuguese chicken, chorizo and fries. Then there's the spicy sauce. And the San Jorge cheese. Heaven for poutine-a-holics.   I shared the Louis Cyr (half chicken +fries and salad) and small Poutine with my bf and we were so full afterwards.   Long lineups, but you can skip the line if you plan a bit ahead and order by phone. Small (10 tables at most) but turnover is pretty quick. If you're only here for the natas then skip the line and head straight to the pastries counter at the back. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Yo. Wtf?!! I wanted to give this place a 4 1/2 but it's Yelp. Skip the other stuff...just go straight to that spicy chicken. Again. Wtf. That poulet alone is a 5. Fries...meh..sausage...eh. That spicy chicken. Mother..."}
{"text":"If you are a meat eater, I guess it is ok. But the chicken is on the dry side and that's about all they have other than fries and poutine. Still don't understand why there was a long line of people waiting. They can also use some improvement on efficiency."}
{"text":"I'll give it 3.5 - 4 stars Crazy local poulet place.  We arrived to a lengthy line up even at 9:00pm but it was a Saturday night so makes some sense although I suspect it is busy regarless. Charcoal roasted chicken was good and was very tender and moist.  If they could ever time the demand with the supply and serve chicken right off the grill, that would be spectacular.  But everyone settled for the pre-cooked chicken kept in their warming \"cupboards\".  Which was still good and reasonably fresh. Servings of fries and salad were humongous with the chicken.  We had the petite poutine also which when combined with the chicken and sausage, was a bit overwhelming after getting through about a quarter of the plate. Value for money - great Food overall - good for the money Atmosphere - local vibrant Montreal"}
{"text":"The chorizo and chicken poutine combo is out of this world. The half size can probably be shared, it's a ton of food."}
{"text":"The Best Chicken Portuguese in town with affordable price!!!! They also have variety desserts.."}
{"text":"C'est en sortant d'une promenade au parc Lafontaine (et en sentant les frites de la Banquise!) que j'ai vu, pour la première fois, Ma Poule Mouillée. Étant sur le chemin, je me suis dit que c'était peut être le bon moment de goûter une rôtisserie portugaise autre que le Romados.  Juste en face de la Banquise, Ma Poule Mouillée est un restaurant qui sert du poulet soigneusement cuit à la broche, des poutines/sandwichs mais aussi des pâtisseries. On raconte que le chef est un ancien employé de Romados !  Même lors d'un dimanche soir, il y a du monde. L'attente peut parfois s'avérer longue (5 à 10 minutes, voire plus). Le décor, que j'aime particulièrement est moderne et minimaliste à la fois.  Il y a plusieurs menus en fonction du morceau de poulet que vous voulez prendre (poitrine, poulet entier). Pour ma part, j'avais pris le \"Victor Medina\", soit une cuisse (sauce épicée), avec frites et salade. Le tout pour 8$ taxes incluses ! À ce prix là, le menu est bien fourni (voire trop fourni même!) en frites. À la fin, c'est garanti que vous avez le ventre rempli !   Très abordable, bon rapport qualité/prix, et délicieux, voilà une autre adresse à tester!"}
{"text":"Ma poule mouillée is a must! As a chicken lover, I was craving for spicy Portuguese chicken and this is my first time and it was one of a hell amazing choice that I made.   Getting there, I noticed how huge the portions were while they were serving the people in line. I waited in line around 5 minutes and i was served. I asked for the petit talbot with fries. Omg, the portions are huge and everything is made by them which was great, the marination of the spices, the breads as they bake it fresh at the restaurant as well as their huge selection of Pastries! I was surprised to see so much of their love and efforts  put into their foods.   I paid and got a Portuguese egg tarts too and it was delicious. Love the egg tarts, it's probably one of the best I've ever had in Montreal so far! It's $1.50 for 1 but if you get 6, it costs $7. They also have other pastries like mille Feuille, croissants, crème filled cakes which looks so good!   At my first bite of my chicken sandwich in that spicy sauce, I was already satisfied and fell in love with it! I definitely wish that they put more of spicy sauce on their sandwiches and chicken as I wanted mine spicy when I told the man who served me as I love when my foods are spicy.   They have such cute way of presentation too with their layouts as well as the chalk board menu. Overall, I was happy for my first visit and I'd recommend it all if you all wanted Portuguese chicken as it's moist and consistent with the spicy Sauce which they sell as well! That sauce is a family recipe which to me means a lot as it's passed down.  They are all so nice. :)  I'd return to check out their huge plate of Poutine next time but my tummy was happy after crushing my fun-filled plate with chicken sandwich and chips and dessert as well.   :)"}
{"text":"I had come here a couple of times over the last 3 years and have always have the chicken sandwich. The sandwich was always great! Very juice and perfectly grilled chicken.  This week, I finally come back after a while, and decided to try their poutine. WHOA! What a poutine! The chicken + chorizo + bit of piri-piri sauce makes it indescribable amazing! The fries are very crispy outside and tender inside; even after 20 minutes on the gravy they were still crispy!! (I did take out, and I am a slow eater). Plus, the \"small\" one is big enough (the \"regular\" is huge!) and for just $8 is a bargain.  I will definitely keep on coming here! Particularly while drinking in La Quincaillerie."}
{"text":"The prices are reasonable the chicken is juicy !! The salad dressing was so flavourful and had me eating my salad first !  Must be warned at peak times seating is difficult !"}
{"text":"I just came here yesterday with a friend for a late lunch and as soon as I sat down to chow down, I wished I had a second stomach. My friend had been raving about Ma Poule Mouillée for weeks and in particular he had lauded the restaurant's poutine suggesting that it is much better than that of La Banquise; naturally I needed to try it! Since we came for the poutine, I thought that a meal made entirely of poutine might seem a little less decadent with a side salad. The combination of a poutine and a salad was very nice. Indeed, the poutine is a must! DELICIOUS! NOTHING is small here! The side salad was huge ($3), the ''petite'' poutine was huge ($8)! Prices include tax and so for only $11 exactly I ate like a queen. The next time that my family is in town, I will definitely bring them here for the poutine and the chicken."}
{"text":"The 1/2 chicken was amazing. The portion size was immense. The dish comes with choice sides of potatoes (either fries or the small, round ones or both),  salad and rice. Some of us took all four side options and let's just say that the server was generous with his servings.   The chicken was moist and spicy and had great flavor. The sauce over the chicken was delicious and I'm def going back to buy some of that sauce. I loved the rustic decor too and the taxes-inclusive, cheap prices will keep bringing me back to this place from now on for sure. I can't go back to Romados after discovering this place!"}
{"text":"The servings are huge. Be ready to walk out stuffed a shared poutine plate of a small size is more than enough for two people to share. Or the half of a chicken french fries and a salad plate is also more than enough for two people to share. But if you're looking for a specific kind of non-sugary drink that they do not have. If you do not speak French let them know they have an English speaking menu."}
{"text":"Bookmarked this place for a while now. Finally got to try it. I read the comments before and read lots of them saying how big the portions are over there. Man, they were all right about that! We ordered a quarter chicken plate and a small poutine for 2 people and it was more than enough! We step in the restaurant and the line up kept going for the whole time we were there. The place is small with not many seats but we managed to get a table. The menu is written on the wall. The prices are really reasonable for the size portion they give. The portugese chicken was slightly dry inside but it was well marinated on the outside. As long as they keep the same quality and prices, I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I only write reviews when there is information necessary for future consumers to know. Yes, the chicken is delicious. And that's saying a lot, since I have lived in Singapore, Japan and NYC. But don't ever, in any attempt to reduce your calorie, substitute their fries with rice. Their rice is the most horrible rice I had ever eaten in my life. It was hard and most probably uncooked. If they can't cook rice, why bother to serve?"}
{"text":"J'ai été à Ma Poule Mouillée pour un diner avec mes collègues de job et j'ai été impressionné par leur assiette. C'est une rôtisserie portugaise, donc vous ne serez pas étonné de voir des poulets tournés sur une broche en entrant.  Sérieux, c'est malade comment les assiettes sont grosses pour le peu d'argent qu'on doit payer.  Regardez moi la taille de cette assiette. C'est vraiment le fun quand on a faim.  J'ai pris le combo poulet / chorizo et c'était tout simplement divin. C'est certain qu'il ne faut pas y aller souvent, car ça doit pas être à faible teneur en calorie. Il y a même une petite salade à côté pour vous sentir moins coupable.  Pour finir il y a un choix de petites tartelettes qui sont une spécialité portugaises."}
{"text":"We didn't expect the long lineup but as soon as we took the first bite of the poutine, we knew it was worth the wait!!   We ordered half chicken with fries and rice. And a small poutine topped with grilled chicken. The food was excellent. But the poutine was exceptionally good.   We were very satisfied with the food and will definitely be coming by again!   Just wish the floors and tables were clean and dry. We had to grab extra napkins to clean our table and even then the floor was sticky and wet."}
{"text":"L'une des meilleures poutines de Montreal! La viande parfaitement cuite donne un goût parfait au plat!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite poutine places (although it serves mainly portuguese chicken). Their chicken chorizo poutine is to die: crispy fries topped off with their homemade spicy sauce, chopped chorizo and grilled chicken, cheese curds and gravy. It is definitely one of my favourite guilty pleasures. The only thing that bothers me is the size of the poutine (the small feeds me for two meals and I am not one of those dainty eaters) and its salt content - it can get quite salty!  Definitely grab one of those Portuguese sou drinks as well! It pairs up with the poutine amazingly well."}
{"text":"Best Portuguese Chicken in town. I'm not a fan of poutine but I crave their PORTUGUESE POUTINE at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The flavours are fantastic (their spicy sauce on the chicken is to die for), the portions are massive, but I have one (big) gripe that leads to my lower-star rating. On two occasions now, I've managed to get splinters of chicken bone lodged into the back of my throat. I'm not talking big bones from lazy chewing, I mean tiny little splinters. Those tiny little shards that you can't even feel when you are chewing. This makes it hurt to swallow for two days after. I know I know - you are probably thinking: slow down, don't inhale your food dude. Trust me, I tried this. It was clearly ineffective. Their brutalist chicken smashing knife skills can result in tiny bone shards peppered throughout the chicken. Unless they change their practices, my advice is: enjoy the heck out of that delicious chicken... but proceed with caution."}
{"text":"Let me just say I don't even like chicken usually but this place is the bomb.com. The portion sizes are HUGE, it's easily 2 meals or more if you get chicken and fries (and it comes with salad too!) the sauce is amazing, I make a point to always eat here when I visit mtl. The only issue is that this place is super popular so you can have a hard time getting a place to sit, but the lineup is definitely worth the wait"}
{"text":"Ambiance: tranquille et relaxe. Juste assez de bruits comme dans un bistro! Belle place.   Poutine (poulet et saucisse): goûteuse grâce aux morceaux de saucisses. Si on prend seulement les frites et la sauce...poutine bien ordinaire.   1/2 poulet avec frites et salade : clairement pas assez de sauce, mais pas sec.   Overall: Ramados est meilleur de loin! Le 10 min de marche de plus vaut le déplacement."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to start with this... The portions are HUGE. While we were waiting in line, we saw other people's food get plated and said to each other, \"maybe we should order THAT; THAT is HUGE! We could split one of those instead of these meals written on the wall.\" Turns out, what we saw WAS one of the meals written on the wall. So, my companion and I split the (#9?) the chicken breast plate. For $9 or $10CAD, we got a healthy portion of delicious chicken, a mound of rice, and a lunch-sized salad with some tasty dressing. We also got an order of the potato balls on top (they were my least favorite part of this meal, but I - in general - don't really care for potatoes, so you should try them). When plating our food, we were asked if we wanted \"spice\" and we agreed; this was a spicy sauce they dabbed on the chicken. I was expecting it to have a hot sauce sort of effect and I was nervous because there was so much of it, but it really isn't spicy. I think it enhanced the flavor for sure.  We also got two natas and yummmmmmm they were good! The custard was super smooth and thick and the pastry cup was perfect (not dry at all).  FYI - Everything is in French and I am not sure if they have an English menu. it's cafeteria style, so you order at the beginning of the counter and work your way down to the cashier."}
{"text":"Great little place, very popular and very busy, so come early. The line does move quickly but you may be stuck to find a table to eat at.  I had the chicken sandwich with mild sauce. The bread had a nice bite to it, which I believe is made on site, as they sell bread for purchase also. The chicken was tender and is roasted over coals. The fries are great, with a little spice on them, no need for ketchup here."}
{"text":"Très bon rapport qualité prix! Une poutine faite de produits frais, du bon poulet et des portions généreuses. Un décor design, un bon accueil, des tables propres et une équipe soucieuse de ses clients. Très bonne adresse."}
{"text":"Dilemmas, dilemmas... Romados or Pouille Mouillée? Both serving similar foods, both having lines at peak hours, both having limited seating, both offering kinda affordable prices... The choice can be tough at times... Let's try to review this resto to see if it comes out as a winner in this duel.  To get started, the lines to be expected are sometimes very long, but at most times, you will be waiting around 15 minutes until you get to order, which is not as bad. However, since the restaurant is fairly small, the line tends to extend outside, which might not be very pleasant during winter when it is like -35 degrees outside.   Once inside, you get a choice of different meals, which also includes poutines. Personally, I go for either the thigh or half-chicken meal, which comes with sides of salad and fries. The prices displayed on the wall also includes the taxes already.  Now the food. The chicken itself is well seasoned with tender meat. Portions are also generous, especially the fries. Honestly, the fries are a little lackluster as its seasoning is very hit or miss and unevenly distributed.   Bottomline, the fight is still on between the both of them. But one thing that I can agree on, this is better than that notorious poutine place across the street..."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure how it is that I haven't reviewed this place already. I've been here multiple times, and that's saying something in Montreal! Best grilled chicken of life!  I always get the Louis Cyr to split with my manfriend (who has a huge appetite) and it fills us both - a 1/2 chicken, fries and salad for $12. Excellent, affordable prices on everything - like, a whole chicken and all the goodies for $14. Really nice desserts, too.  This place is so popular that there's always a line-up out the door. Last time I was here, standing on the street, waiting in line (and waiting in line is actually worth it), the Romados truck circled the block multiple times, trying to lure some of Ma Poule Mouillée's customers up the road to its legendary chicken. You know something good is happening here if Romados is hauling out those tactics!  They also do poutine, so if you don't feel like waiting in line at La Banquise, get your poutine here - it's got that amazing chicken sauce, and it comes packed with chorizo. Wowz.  Parc la Fontaine just kitty corner, so take your food to go and find a spot of grass to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I feel blessed to have tried out a delicious meal of Ma Poule Mouillé's specialty, Portuguese chicken, and fries with fellow Elite Yelper Julien. As I said to him, the chicken was incredibly soft. I loved how no part of it was dry. But I'd have to say the fries here were better. (I think he agreed as well.)  I was expecting some waiter service, but apparently you order and pay as you would at a Boustan or a Subway. The way the line-up goes should be clearer. I was at the dessert section just before the cash counter, thinking that my meal would arrive at the cash register. But no, I had to skip past two customers on my way back to the order counter to receive my meal, and then head on over to the cash register.   They did have some desserts that looked appetizing. One of which we tried was what the counter woman jokingly said was a \"salami\". It tasted like cookie dough. By appearance, it had a round and sugar-coated surface, was completely brown, and had nuts. I could not taste the nuts though. However it was good overall and that sufficed for me."}
{"text":"We had planned to go to a well-known and rated Portuguese restaurant here in town. And then a wonderful man working at Le Petit Café told us about this restaurant, and how the the chef used to work at the other restaurant we were going to go to, and how all the locals immediately switched over to this restaurant once that chef moved there.  It has been the absolute crowning jewel of our vacation. Having spent 3 weeks in Portugal in 2006, we are very versed on Portuguese food. For years we have been longing for fire roasted Portugese grilled chicken like we had in the Algarve. La Poule Mouille makes it absolutely perfectly. For $23 total Two of us each had a chicken dinner served with excellent french fries and salad, 4 cokes, and 2 homemade custard pastries. The atmosphere is not at all fancy; many people just go for take-out food. For us, that is part of the charm.  We've been there 3 nights in a row and can't wait to go again tomorrow. Kudos to this natural treasure!"}
{"text":"Ma Poule Mouillée serves up, without a doubt, some of the best roast chicken I've ever had. With its huge spits over which they rotate the chicken until it becomes a nice, golden brown as well as its huge portions, the place never fails to satisfy my cravings.  I ordered the half chicken with salad and fries, and for some reason, I always find myself surprised at the portions they give. Even if you haven't eaten all day, it's nearly impossible to finish everything in one sitting. Maybe it's because they give an enormous amount of fries (aka carbs overload), but I was able to wipe the plate clean with the exception of one piece of chicken. The chicken is oh-so-juicy with the spicy sauce actually being somewhat spicy and melding perfectly with the crispness of the skin, the salad is fresh and has an amazing dressing to go along with it, and the French fries aren't overcooked for once. What's not to love?  Honestly, Ma Poule Mouillée is simple and delivers delicious food without the gimmicks and at a great value, which makes it ideal for students. Go there if you haven't already."}
{"text":"This place makes an EXCELLENT poutine! They put chicken and cherizo in it, I also think the cheese includes some mozarella in addition to cheese curds which makes it more gooey. The portions are enormous so be weary of ordering a large, unless you're going to share, or if you want to bring it home ;)  The prices are great, you get a lot of bang for your buck.  A typical order would be chicken with salad and fries, fills your plate (and belly) right up, for only 11$ (tax included).  There's usually a line, but sometimes you get lucky."}
{"text":"OMG! OH M GEE! This is THE place to hit if you are only going to eat at one place in Montreal. Yes, seriously. I know Montreal is the Gourmet Capital of North America, but this place is literally a one stop shop for all flavors. I ordered a half chicken, the fries and the side salad. I know, sounds so simple, but it was the quality of everything they served me. Everything they put on my plate was so fresh and full of unique flavor...even the salad dressing. My boyfriend ordered the whole chicken and ate every. last. piece. and then licked the plate (I'm kidding).  First off, I'm not sure what they are feeding these chickens, but the were huge, juicy and moist. I've never had a chicken like this in the States. I'm quite sure we had way more chicken than we ordered. Our plates were overflowing with chicken. There chickens were rotisserie cooked and the skin was just so perfect! We each chose the red \"sauce\" they use to make these chickens special. I chose spicy and my boyfriend chose mild. The flavor was so interesting...as the sauce had a \"spice\" or \"heat\" I've not encountered before; it left me wanting more! Almost like a vinegar, butter, salty flavor. Sounds odd, but it works! We ended up visiting this place twice on our four day visit to Montreal. We went once for dinner and a second time for lunch. On our second visit, I ordered the poutine. Absolutely amazing! So much food, such a value and incredibly flavorful. This is an absolute must when visiting the Montreal area!"}
{"text":"My wife and I saw this place with a long line as we were waiting across the street at La Banquise.  We decided to try it couple of days later before we drove back home at 1030am.  The chicken wasn't ready so we waited for 15 minutes but it was definitely worth it.  The chicken was delicious and the portions were extremely generous.  We had many great meals in Montreal but this was definitely the tastiest of them all!"}
{"text":"First when I think of Quality vs price : I wish I could give an extra star!!  This place  is everything you want from a restaurant. Huge portions, small prices and amazing taste. I loved every bite. I tried the poutine and the half chicken. I'll let the pics speak for themselves but oh boy. That poutine is hands down one of the best I have ever had. When you mix chorizo, Portuguese chicken, cheese,  fries and RIDICULOUSLY good sauce, I think you have a recipe straight from heaven.  I applaud the staff, they are fast and effective.  Didn't have to wait for too long even though there was a line up."}
{"text":"Their chicken is the best. Their marination is my favorite. My husband and I go there for takeout. Also we buy their extra marination spicy sauce and we use more of it on the chicken. In fact we started using it on all our food. Always crowded and busy but worth the wait. This is why we always prefer to takeout."}
{"text":"I sincerly think that this little restaurant deserves being my fav Portuguese restaurant in Montreal. Sorry Romados, you just moved down to the second place hahah.. I usually don't like to do comparaisons   This is a small and very well located restaurant which is located just in front of La Fontaine Park and across other great gems too. The place is clean,you smell the BBQ from far away and I decided to pass by hoping the place won't be as busy.  I picked the \"Veronique plate\" which you'll find in your order: chicken, chorizo sausage, fries and salad. I do admit on the fact that I love eating a lot and there portions are done to perfection. The skin on chicken is crispy and perfectly seasoned and interior is juicy and so rich.  They also do their own bakery which is done by also by other similar restaurants and I loved the idea that they do sell their spicy sauce.. Oh and service was super quick!  My platter + soft drink came back for about 12$ and that's including taxes.  PS.. I took the picture of my plate after noticing I ate all the chorizo slices.. Sorry, you won't find any lol"}
{"text":"MPM is quickly gaining a reputation in this city as a staple where one can get one of the best grilled chicken in this city. Portuguese establishments on Rachel street seriously get their chicken right!!  I opted for their chicken sandwich it was fantastic. Big portion, succulent moist chicken... can't ask for more for the very reasonable price they asked of me. I also picked up some pastel de natas tarts (Portuguese sweet tarts) and they really made my day.  The sandwich and dessert were 5 stars and I'll be back for these over and over again when I find myself in this area.  The reason I'm giving 4 stars is that I found their service lacking. It looked like everyone was having a bad day and couldn't be bothered. Sure, I got my food in about 10 minutes but the effort to interact with their clients was virtually non-existent.  My order was placed not with a Hello or Welcome, he just looked at me and raised his eyebrows... so I placed my orde. When I got to the cash, the cash guy billed me before I asked if I wanted anything else with my sandwich such as a drink or dessert. I had to insist to get this and he seemed slightly bothered he had to edit the price in the cash register and grab the extra items.  I understand there's sometimes a line-up that goes all the way to the door but that shouldn't be an excuse to have the common decency to acknowledge your patron's needs. During my visit, only 2 patrons were in front of me and when I paid, 2 of them were behind me. You should be happy to have such business.  Beyond that, this place is the real deal when it comes to Portuguese food, very very good stuff beyond the silly establishment's name."}
{"text":"Super poulet portugais vraiment bon prix! Pas de la haute gastronomie mais bien agréable à partager entre amis!Très populaire! La file est soi est longue mais le tout demeure rapide!"}
{"text":"The line was put the door but it was certainly worth the wait. Probably the tastiest thing in Montreal for the price. 10$ gets you a  meal with 1/4 chicken, fries, and a salad. The chicken is crispy and covered in their sauce. We got mild, which was a sort of flavorful oil, not spicy at all. The dressing on the salad seems to be a mustard vinaigrette, it was delicious."}
{"text":"This was my favourite place I've eaten at in Montreal. Poutine is great comfort food, but I'm a bigger fan of chicken. The wait for the food was around an hour during dinner time but the food was well worth the wait.  The cheese curds were naturally melted from the heat of the chicken and steaming gravy.  Would suggest to get the chicken glazed with the extra sauce which adds a bit of spice!"}
{"text":"Ma Poule Mouillee is a Portuguese chicken eatery that's owned by Chef Antonio Alves and has been around since '13.  The menu offers charcoal-grilled chicken, sandwiches, salads, poutines, and even daily specials (such as grilled squid, octopus, sardines, and grilled cod).  I was interested in checking this place out, as it seems to be a competitor against Romado's, another local favorite for Portuguese charcoal-grilled chicken.  The hubs and I had the Louis CYR, which came with 1/2 of a chicken, salad with dressing, and fries (in which we opted for the whole roasted baby potatoes instead).  I did request for extra sauce this time around, in which the staff member kindly brushes on as much as you want.  The chicken itself was slightly dried out, but the sauce and the skin tasted delicious - there was a nice smoky flavor to it, and more of a grilled taste to the bone.  More sauce was needed, though.  The salad and the boiled potatoes were forgettable, but I do have to note that they do give you a very generously-sized portion!  You order up by the grill, then you go along to the cashier to pay.  The place has seating, but it is pretty much busy all the time.  I'll probably request for a cup of extra sauce the next time and just stick with the chicken!  +Portuguese charcoal-grilled chicken +forget the sides +request for extra sauce +order first, grab tray, then pay +seatings available, but extremely busy"}
{"text":"Pretty delicious.  Loved the spicy sauce that came with the whole rotisserie chicken, but the wait was forever long (and line moving at a snail's pace) at night.  Waited over 45 minutes at 9pm.  Worth it?  It was good, but I'd rather go to Romados, where the service is much faster."}
{"text":"Smells so good. Had a fabulous poutine slathered in Portuguese chicken. Delicious.  It was the #8.  Decor is fine.  Staff are efficient. It's a busy place.  Would I return? Yea Would I recommend? Yes"}
{"text":"Just hearsay, but apparently the chef that is now at Ma Poule Mouillee was the chef at Romados.   \"My Sweaty Chicken\". The translation of the name. Does the name fit? All I know is this place has officially made my taste buds sweat for more poutine!! This place, hands down, deserves a standing ovation for their poutine. Phenomenal food. Fast, friendly, and hella tasty eats!!  Before this, I'd only had one single encounter with poutine, and that was a bite of the dish at The Rossi. The gravy was tan and opaque (I don't like traditional gravy, the Thanksgiving mainstay), and the curds were small, minimal and way overly salty. Not a good first impression.   I was wary to try Montreal's staple dish, but I can forever rest my nerves! Canadian poutine's gravy is beef based. Smooth and thin/runny. And bursting with flavor! I got #9 - Traditional poutine, but with the addition of chicken and chorizo.  Visualize: A heaping pile of fresh hot seasoned French fries smack out of the basket. A giant scoop of fresh cheese curds spread atop. One-fourth pulled Portuguese-sauced/seasoned chicken straight from the spits. Tons of chorizo. And, a big ol ladle of beef gravy. Fresh cilantro, and the exceptional meal is ready for consumption.   I will absolutely, no questions asked make this a must-stop restaurant from now on, when I'm in Montreal. I may have made a dent, if that, while eating, and had plenty to take to-go for a few meals in the airport.   My mouth is watering just writing this. I wish they'd deliver. To Ohio. To my front door. That was a memorable meal!!"}
{"text":"I passed by this place when I was from La Banquise. There was a long line up so I looked it up. It's Portuguese Chicken with your salad, potatoes or poutine. Sure, why not.   I went in around 2pm and there was a small line up. The person who served us looks like Robert Downey Jr, no lie! He must have thought I was a weirdo because I kept looking at him.   The staff were nice, very friendly people. If you're just buying a whole chicken, you can ask one of the guys and bypass the line. I don't know if it's a thing, but it's what one old lady did. I mean, I guess if you're just putting chicken in a box, no point waiting through the line up.   I got the Portuguese chicken, with the sausage and piri-piri sauce on my poutine. Oh. My. God. I was in heaven. I loved it! It was so full of flavour and they're very generous with their toppings. Normally, I run out of toppings for my fries but with them, I ran out of fries with my toppings. It was simply delicious! Towards the end, it was getting too salty. I mean, cheese, gravy, piri-piri, sausage and what not.   I got the spicy piri-piri and it wasn't that spicy. It was more like a kick to it, but nothing too strong. I'm not a spicy eater, so if it really was spicy, I wouldn't be able to eat it.   Overall, highly recommended place. If you like Portuguese chicken and the works, have it on your poutine and life will be good! At least for that moment."}
{"text":"Hard to be beat the QPR of Poule Mouillé. 11$ tax in for half a chicken with salad and fries smothered in that spicy sauce. Plate is impossible to finish for any appetite. Service however needs some improvement. A definite destination as this Portuguese rotisserie cooks on charcoal. Bring your appetite and be patient as 30 minute line ups are the norme at this joint. Well done."}
{"text":"Easily the best fries I have ever eaten, and the chicken was just incredible. I ordered the meal with 1/4 thighs. The salad and dressing were fantastic as well. Extremely cheap, I shared one order with a friend and were were both quite full, but even if I had ordered a meal for myself the prices were dirt-cheap."}
{"text":"The best thing to do when you're hungry after a Yelp event, hit up the closest Portuguese Chicken joint with 5 of your closest Yelp friends from the event!   Chicken was super tasty, with a generous amount of Piri Piri, bonus: the salad was definitely not an afterthought as it was fresh and delightful, and fries were seasoned (perhaps a tiny bit too well for my liking but oh what the hey).   We all agreed that it was nice to not have to do a line up of a million people like some other chicken stops in this city, and that it was clean, with a place to sit too. Oh and for reals that portuguese chicken poutine not only looked amazing but tasted good (I can attest to this because I had a bite of Kate B.'s."}
{"text":"The poutine was a recommendation of our Uber driver and was absolutely incredible. The portion sizes are gigantic, so order conservatively. The line when we arrived was outside the door, and this was on a Thursday night! Delicious food in my new favorite part of Montreal ! Great walking around after eating a ton of food."}
{"text":"Fantastic & authentic Portuguese chicken! My wife picked up a bird, poutine, and large fries last night and it reminded me of how good Romados \"used\" to be. The  chicken, while not huge pieces, are moist and tender with a nice charcoal-grilled aroma. The poutine has a nice brown sauce on the fries mixed with chorizo and chicken pieces. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Hier soir teste de la poutine.  Vraiment pas déçu de ce test. Elle est bonne et la quantité est généreuse. Le rapport qualité-quantité-prix  est encore au rdv. Pour 7$ (petite) ou 12$ (grande), prix taxes incluses, vous avez le choix de manger une bonne poutine."}
{"text":"Highly recommend trying this place out! You get an enormous plate of food for a very good price. The chicken sauce is super flavorful and not greasy. And service is super quick!  Visited January 2017"}
{"text":"Great Chicken, Great ambience. Good player in the Montreal chicken scene! I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place had the best poutine! They make the fries and roast the chicken right in front of you. The fries are lightly seasoned, giving them an amazing taste. Their poutine comes with chicken and pork, but I am a vegetarian so I didn't get the meat. Their gravy was delicious and their portions are huge.   They have a spicy sauce that is very flavorful and tastes great with the gravy. I got extra sauce because it wasn't spicy enough for me. Even though it wasn't the healthiest food, it was definitely worth it. Overall, I would greatly recommend this restaurant if you are carving good poutine!"}
{"text":"The best Portuguese chicken I've had, and probably one of the best poutines I've had as well. Granted, I'm from Vancouver so I don't have that much to compare to, but during my stay in Montreal, this is by far one of my favourites."}
{"text":"Ohhh so good. We crewed up and took out poutine from here for a picnic in Lafontaine Park. And then I ate the rest of mine fried up for leftovers breakfast, which is in my top 2 all time breakfasts second only to pie.  This poutine is exceptional, moist chicken bits with crispy spicy skin, amazing chucks of hot red sausage, gorgeous gravy, thick fresh french fries, everything you want in a poutine if you are a poutine lover. There was no line at 5:30pm on a Monday and there were casual comfortables places to sit inside by big windows. Friendly rapid staff, mega quantities, full 5 stars in my opinion."}
{"text":"Today i visited here the second time this week because the food was really good. I paid cash but that was a mistake. I ordered a number 8 petite size and 4 pastries and a drink and the total was 21 dollars and i handed the cashier 40 dollars but when i came back home, i realized that i only had received 9 dollars back in change. I called the place the first time and talked to the employee and told her i received the wrong change and told me to wait on the phone and she hung up. I called 3 more times and they cut the phone line. Make sure you receive your receipt and check the change they give you when you pay cash."}
{"text":"Good grilled chicken, I think even better than other grilled chicken restaurant. Great portion size. Good spicy sauce. Lots of bakery selections to choose from.  Can't wait to try chicken pouting next time!"}
{"text":"Legendary status! Lol the portions are gigantic and the food is priced so decently (with taxes included--amazing). The 'small poutine' is enough to feed two adults and is worth every penny. Also try the cheesecake! Only 3$ and is so good. Love this spot!!"}
{"text":"Trop Bon!!! I tried almost everything at this restaurent. Everything are really good. Also love their Portuguese tarts... yummO!!  Always a long line up but serve very fast. Seats are not very comfortable... I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I brought my friends here to have dinner today, and when I went to ask for some ketchup, the girl at the cash (the one with facial hair on her upper lip) shouted in my face loudly with a \"What?!!!!\" The strong impatience on her face and the embarrassment totally spoiled my appetite. I'm 100% sure I said \"please\" when asking. Didn't see that coming at all because it was not my first time here and all the other employees are friendly. Maybe I wasn't loud enough when asking, but I certainly do not deserve that especially after 1hr of lineup. The food is just great, but if you ever want to ask for some ketchup, be cautious of the cashier girl with facial hair."}
{"text":"Better than the place I usually go on Rachel...The chicken, the sauce, the fries and the salad, and it's next to the park. Absolutely amazing place to come for some Portuguese chicken. The line can be a bit long at times and you need to be lucky to grab a seat, but I still highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious place about 10 mins walk from metro Mont Royal. It is always packed but the service is very fast! The chicken is so juicy and tasty! You get plenty of food for a cheap price! A 12$ plate can easily feed 2 hungry people! Also all their price is tax included! They also have delicious pastries that I ate too fast and forgot to take a picture. Definitely recommend especially if you want to eat on a budget in Mont Royal."}
{"text":"This is the spot, amazing food at a great price. I split a full order of poutine fries with chorizo and 1/2 chicken between my friend and I. We left full and content.  The flavor on the chicken is great with a good blend between spices and a bit of tang from the sauce they use. The chicken can be a little dry in some of the leaner areas but when they're running a busy operation like this, I can't expect it to be perfect. The poutine fries with chorizo is a must order. You know cause everyone else ordered it, even that small 5 feet girl sitting in the corner has a plate to herself.   We had the opportunity to try both this spot and Romados. I have to give it to Ma Poule due to the better flavor on the chicken in my opinion. In addition, maybe it's unfair to Romados since I came when they weren't busy but my food was a little cold. Even my cheese curds on the poutine didn't melt. Whereas at Ma Poule where there was a bit of a wait and they were churning out the food with speed, steam was coming off of the food the whole meal since it came right off the grill.  In the end, for roughly 24 CAD, you'll be thinking of Ma Poule in your sleep and walking home with a smile on your face.   ALSO, get the egg tarts. It was so good and only 1.50 each! It was more custard like but I enjoyed this variation more than the Chinese style.   Tl;dr: Eat here. Poutine fries. Egg tarts. Ma Poule is your go to for Portuguese chicken."}
{"text":"Je n'ai été ici que deux fois et c'est surement mieux pour ma ligne. Ma poule mouillé est specialisé dans les recettes de poulet cuit a la broche et autant dire qu'ils font ca bien.   Lorsque l'on rentre on voit directement le grill gigantesque avec du poulet de partout. On se dirige vers la caisse car ici on commande, on paye et ensuite on récupère son plat pour aller s'assoir. Ce n'est pas tres grand donc il faut de temps en temps attendre un peu ou sinon vous pouvez prendre a emporter.  J'ai décidé de commander le poulet au chorizo. Lorsque j'ai été servi je me suis demandé pourquoi j'avais pris cela et comment j'allais finir. En effet quelque soit le plat que vous choisissez il y a de forte chance que ce soit très copieux. J'ai vraiment eu du mal a finir surtout que le chorizo était un peu piquant. Je dois avouer que pour ce prix je ne m'attendais pas à avoir tout cela dans mon assiette mais comme je suis un grand garcon j'ai tout de même tout mangé....  Bon si comme moi vous avez du mal après un tel repas il y a le parc Lafontaine juste a coté pour aller digerer."}
{"text":"I had a difficult time figuring out which Portuguese place to hit up with my limited time in Montreal. Should I go to good 'ol reliable, favourite Romados or try one of the new players in town? After much debate, I decided to check out Ma Pouille Mouillée as I kept on reading so many great things about them.  Located across the street from La Banquise, the inside is actually quite spacious. Several tables to sit at but be like everyone else and take it to Parc Lafontaine for an impromptu picnic.  Hours are bomb. Everyday open early and late till 10:00pm! The menu is up on the wall and prices already includes all the taxes!  Stand in line and order. It's like an assembly line. As you make your way down, the till is at the end where you can grab drinks and desserts.  - Le Louis Cyr (#2) ($11.00) - half a chicken with fries and salad. Portion size is huge! A mountainous amount of fries and chicken. I should mention that I attempted to eat all this by myself - don't try this at home folks.  Slather on the spicy sauce. Chicken was flavourful, tender and moist for the most part. Couple pieces of white meat that were too dry. The salad was great and the vinaigrette was addictively delicious  - Natas ($1.50) - natas are in the back near the counter so don't forget to order one. Man, I miss good natas. This one was superb. Perfect amount of sweetness, flaky and slightly torched.  Make sure you go to at least one of the many, many Portuguese places while you're in town."}
{"text":"Best chicken, fries, salad meal in Montreal.   The crown used to go to Romados which is still amazingly good but MPM is a notch better.   Tony Alves the owner used to work at Romados for 20 years. His defection would be similar to if Tom Brady and Bill Belichek left the Patriots for elsewhere (damm I sure do not like Brady).   ******local tip #1 ******Come early if you don't have patience for long lines. I mean real real early. We came at 4:30pm on a Saturday  and it was already 5-10 people out the door. When we left at 5:30 pm it was around 20-25 deep in line. I've seen it 40-50 deep at 6pm.   The chicken is moist, fall off the bone and charcoal grilled delish. Over 200 reviews have stated that so no need to continue. The fries are equally good. The salad does get lost under a mountain of chicken and fries but it's good to have something healthy on this gargantuan fat man's plate.  Dining is simple. Don't come expecting much. The volume of food they sell through here is insane. I had courteous service and the restaurant felt like a sweltering inferno on an October day.   *****local tip#2***** your hair and clothes will absorb the smell as will the leftovers in your car. Don't wear those Sunday church clothes.   *****local tip#3**** if you like spicy ask for extra orange hot sauce. They paint it on with a brush and it's what makes this place a notch over Romados.   Enjoy to the max. Live to eat don't eat to live!"}
{"text":"MTL Blog did not lie. Better then Romados. Nuff' said."}
{"text":"Tender juicy chicken with a bit of spice at a very decent price, what more can you ask?"}
{"text":"Very good, new-ish Portuguese chicken place across from poutine stalwart La Banquise on Rachel. Bright and attractive metal, wood and slate interior; a reassuring hum from the hulking ventilation ducts with the Herculean task of keeping this place from smelling like a fire pit. A mesmerizing whirl of chicken and smoke, slowly rotating over the heat. I watched a more senior staff member point out a small dab of salad dressing that had leaked onto a squeeze bottle, and it was quickly dabbed away with a towel. This level of care befits a serious chicken operation, although I agree with previous reviewers that nothing happens especially fast here.   I prefer their chicken to Romados (controversial I know) and to Piri Piri, but not by much. The fries are excellent, tossed with a cracked spice blend that includes fragrant coriander seed. You may wait a while after getting your food before settling at the cash, but no one looks askance if you start eating your fries in the checkout line.   I would have liked a self-serve water fountain and condiment dispensers; I did a sad job of tearing open little packets of Heinz ketchup with my greasy, greasy chicken fingers. But whatever, their food really is finger-lickin' good and it keeps me coming back for more."}
{"text":"$4 for a filling chicken sandwich and only 2 bucks more to add salad or really tasty looking potatoes. I grabbed one of these tasty sammy's and headed over to Parc Lafontaine and I can guarantee you I will be doing this again. They have a bunch of other options too including chorizo and Portugese pastries in the back.   Service was a tad slow but they are new so I forgive them - they'll get it.   Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"C'est l'un de mes restaurants portugais préférés. J'adore leur poulet, toujours aussi bon, et les quantités sont énormes et les prix sont très abordables.  Le seul hic c'est le line-up, Et si vous voulez l'éviter, appelez une 20 minutes à l'avance pour commander, comme ça une fois arriver votre commande sera prête et vous n'avez qu'à choisir un spot et savourer le bon poulet grillé! Miaaam"}
{"text":"The food at this place was so good. I've been thinking about going here for a while ever since I saw it from across the street at la banquise. The first thing you see is the chicken being cooked rotisserie style and people lining up to order. They don't have the most seats here but still some benches for groups and individual seats.   I ordered the big Portuguese style poutine with chicken, chorizo and piri piri sauce all for $12. The poutine is huge, all the stuff are on top a mountain of fries. On top of the portion being big (which is always good for me) it tastes amazing. The chicken, chorizo and the sauce all had great flavour to add to the good fries, cheese curds & gravy.   Never really had Portuguese food before this and now I know I'll definitely be coming back here. Lol even ran into and met sugar Sammy here."}
{"text":"Ma Poule Mouillee poutine hands down!  It is delicious, sausage flavourful and chicken super juicy.  The gravy was just enough to cover but not soak too much into the fries and was not overly salty like other poutine restaurants.  They recommended a little spicy sauce for the kick and that's exactly what I got.  No regrets ... maybe only that it was too much food for 1 to eat."}
{"text":"So delicious! So cheap! Chicken is smooshed flat and has real smokey flavor from the coals. Delicious salad dressing, fresh bakery treats. The potato balls are amazing. The only thing I didn't love is the fries but not from Montreal so I'll leave that to the experts."}
{"text":"La nourriture est vraiment bonne , l'endroit est super chaleureux. J'ai pris une poitrine de poulet et des frites. J'ai beaucoup aimé."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite chicken in the city! Not only is this place consistently delicious and amazing but it's also affordable for it's mega portions. I always order the Louis Cyr which is the half chicken which comes with fries and salad (I always ask for more salad than fries because their salad dressing is just too good). Their fries are also wonderfully seasoned. Honestly, I can't praise this place enough. The food is great and the staff are fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The chicken is meatier and juicier than Romados. The skin is crispy and tasty. No awkward long lines and prices are very similar. Unlike Romados, this place has more places to sit down and eat. I like the cafeteria style line, except it can get long during rush hours. I need to try this pouting everyone is talking about.  I'm hooked, this place will see me again that's for sure."}
{"text":"Best Roasted/Grilled/Smoked Chicken I've ever had. Nice staff, clean restaurant, half chicken + fries + veg = $11.00! Great for both local and visitors! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best deal in town! Everything is great in this simple Portuguese eatery."}
{"text":"2nd time eating at this restaurant. Ordered the large poutine and the Tony Alvez between my friend and I.  Could not finish it all but extremely satisfied. Good thing this restaurant is not in Toronto or I would become obese."}
{"text":"Affordable price with generous portions  Always eating their poutine there  Good place for students"}
{"text":"This place is incredible! Even though we were vacationing in Montreal, I was going to pass on the whole poutine scene as it sounds pretty heavy and gross if I am being honest. As we were enjoying the park and worked up a good appetite, we found this place on Yelp and man am I glad. Great service and fantastic food. As you walk in you see the chicken roasting over coals and the people preparing the food busily chopping and serving the meals. My wife had a half chicken and salad while I had the all out poutine with chicken and some smoked meat added. We took the food to go, planning to eat in the park nearby. With cold sodas in hand, we found a bench and just dug into one of the best meals I had in Montreal if not THE best. I was very wrong about poutine. The cheese curds and gravy made a great base for the chicken which was perfectly juicy and smokey in flavor. Everything was baller here. If I went back I would ask for the spicy option. I get a bit worried ordering spicy at a place I don't know as too much spice can overpower a meal and ruin the experience, but here I think spicy is referring to the Portuguese flavoring they add which is delicious. If you are in the area, don't you dare overlook it! We ran into other people during our visit, and some locals were like, \"Oh yeah, they are the best poutine in the city.\""}
{"text":"Yes; I came back. As a matter of fact; this was the first place we ate at once we got to Montreal, and I'm glad to report that their chicken is still finger-licking delicious! We waited in line for an hour.. really. It seems that Ma Poule has gained much popularity since the last time I was here, and how can it not be popular? You get half a chicken cooked perfectly over charcoal, salad, a ton of poutine style french fries and for 2 bucks more they add Portuguese Chorizo. You get a plate big enough for two people to share, all a little over $10; amazing!  The workers were very jovial, and eager to strike conversation with their patrons, probably because they know they've been standing for an hour to eat. Once you do get your food, finding a seat is the issue, it can be crowded and uncomfortable.  Amazing food, great service, can't wait to go back on my next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"That was a wayyy better chicken experience than at Ramados. We had a large poutine with chicken and chorizo (CAN$13, and you have enough food for 3 with that) and it actually was very tasty. The chicken smelled and tasted fantastic. And you can go eat in the nearby park, surrounded by squirrels - what's not to love?"}
{"text":"Great chicken with amazing source! I honestly never tried Portuguese meals before and I will say the chicken really catches my tongue. And my roommate said the egg tarts were amazing as well, I personally am not a big egg tart fan, but you guys can trust my roommate's taste.  I ordered the 1/4 chicken leg meal as you can see in this picture, some egg tarts, a cream cup and a diet seven cup, everything add up to about $20, and I've already decided to take one whole chicken to go next time."}
{"text":"I got a six dollar (spicy) chicken sandwich by itself to eat in a park. It only had two components, bread and chicken, and it was the best sandwich I've ever had no joke. The orange oil/spicy sauce soaked like one cm into the bread which was soft and flour dusted and just crisp enough on the crust to have good texture but not smoosh the chicken out. The chicken was chopped into manageable pieces and was simply good, probably not the best chicken ever but as a component in the sandwich was perfect. It's perfect to save for later, and the spice level is perfect, enough to feel spicy but it doesn't linger and burn and necessitate a drink."}
{"text":"Fire. Everything on this menu is fire. Came here after yelping some locations. It was a 15min walk but so worth. The chicken is soooooo good. The restaurant is Portuguese and serve the nata custard. Thankfully they had a menu I'm English for us non French speakers. Order at the counter, wait for your food and then proceed to cashier.   Poutine was also real good. I believe it's better than the restaurant across the street.  We came here 3x during our trip. It was that good."}
{"text":"We were about to go wait in line for Resto la banquise when we spotted a line for this place across the street. Intrigued by the Portuguese chicken, we came here and it really hit the spot. We ordered 1/4 chicken thigh meat with salad plus spicy sauce and a petit poutine. The chicken was so soft and flavorful and the spicy sauce was really delicious! The salad was refreshing as a side. The poutine was top notch, covered with chicken and chorizo in addition to the classic cheese curds and gravy.  Petit poutine was already enormous so portion sizes here are really generous. The wait in line is hot because of the rotisseries BUT trust me when I say it'll be well worth the wait!!! Your taste buds will thank you =D"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Portuguese Chicken spot in Montreal. I discover that place a few months back when one of my coworkers decided to go have lunch their.  First impression is that huge line up... you know it's good when there's a long line up lol. Worth the wait and to be honest I really don't mind. At the mean time I'll socialize with complete strangers who share the same passion as me.. food porn lol.  Once inside, they have that long charcoal base bbq cooking the chickens. Charcoal smells are amazing. You actually see how the cooks preps the orders and they are very friendly. Price is right behind them so like this you know what to get.  Believe it or not, their desserts are amazing. I'm a fan of cheesecake.. for $3 you have a nice descent size which i had to share with my buddy.   Price are amazing for the portions you get, basically they are always generous.  Now I'm writing this, I'm getting hungry for some Portuguese chicken:)  P.s you can sit inside and eat but place are really limited , I always take it to go and either eat it at the park nearby or I bring it home with a nice movie playing :)"}
{"text":"A friend highly recommended over Romados & I must admit: I'm blown away. We ordered to pickup, so I don't know about service. The chicken is tender & cooked to perfection. Spiced sauce is intoxicating - spicy tangy tastebud seduction at its finest. The Pastéis de Nata were the best I've ever had: crispy shell, creamy custard."}
{"text":"This place is another one of the best chickens Montreal has to offer. It is easy to go to, and the chicken over there is super tasty! Plus, they serve pretty big portions."}
{"text":"I've been coming here religiously for the past year, this place is incredible. When I first moved to Montreal, and ate at Romado's, I was blown away at how tasty their chicken and fries were. But I hate to say that they have dropped to second place in my heart. Romado's is still good, don't get me wrong, but Ma Poule Mouillée just takes every thing to a whole new level. It's overall such a satisfying, tasty, happy experience. My go-to dishes is the Poutine which comes with their chicken and chopped chorizo sausages, ask for the \"hot sauce\" on top but don't worry, it's not spicey, it just adds another layer of flavour. My second go-to dish is the half-chicken with fries and salad which is equally, if not more tasty and satisfying. What's a shame about my visits here is that the portions are so big, I usually see a couple of people throw away a half eaten plate - please, take it to go for home or give it to a homeless person on the street. The food is too tasty, it hurts my heart every time I see that happen. If you tend to have a small appetite, share an entree. Every time I have friends come into town, this is the first place i take them and not one of them have been disappointed. The folks that work here have always had a neutral vibe. They aren't greeting you with a massive smile, but they aren't impolite either, it's very straight forward."}
{"text":"Best poutine in Montreal!!   Delicious chicken!  Delicious custard tarts!   Delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly spot and portions big enough for two. We got the \"Veronica Special\" that comes with chicken legs, Portuguese sausage, salad and rice. You can ask for half rice and half fries... But it's sort of mixed together. The spicy sauce poured over everything (ask for that), especially the rice, is yum. We also tried the 1/2 chicken combo and that's great too. They have a nice selection of pastries but the best is the Nata, the Portuguese egg tart. We got this for take out 3x in a row and ate it at home with wine during our visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"I found other Yelp elites' reviews were so fond of this place so I were here for some putine. The putine came with grilled chicken and Chorizo . The size is so big. We two people shared a regular one (13$). I'd say the small one would feed us easily. I like the Chorizo very much.I will try number 7 next time.I really like the touch of spicy you can choose to add, adding an extra layer of flavor for my buds. One thing to be improved is the sausage should be warmed up a little since the gravy can't fully heat up the sausage and the cheese. We had some cold bite on the sausage which sabotage the hearty taste.  More seating than Romados, and the grilled chicken looked the same but I only had the putine so I will definitely try the chicken next time.  So glad to find this place. We walked home after dinner, which probably soon will come our routine."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is worth the time spent in the line up! Try the spicy chicken poutine it's delicious. Certainly the best poutine i ever ate in MTL. It's huge, super good and cheap!"}
{"text":"Our original plan was to line up for lunch at another place but it was so cold we quickly gave up and looked for another option. I was slightly disappointed at first because really, how good can rotisserie chicken be? The food though quickly put me in my place. Ma Poule Mouillee changed my life long distain for rotisserie chicken.  The chicken was falling off the bone tender with a beautiful crispy skin. The spicy sauce added a delicious kick without being over powering. I opted for full salad instead of fries (because I ordered an additional small poutine) and I am in love with the dressing...I wish they sold them in bottles. The small poutine can feed three people. It's full of delicious sausages, chicken, and large cheese curds..defiantly does Montreal proud.  Don't leave without trying the portuguese egg tarts. My only regret was not buying a box of them to go."}
{"text":"The portions are massive and the food is simply delicious, I think it may even be better than Romados.   There is usually a line if you come during peak hours, but it moves quickly. I recommend the poutine."}
{"text":"Portuguese chicken is just so good. This rotisserie does it perfectly! At really affordable price too! Problem is, it's reputation is so good that you will likely have to wait 20 to 30min in line (on weekends) to order!"}
{"text":"This was my absolute favorite meal during my 4 day visit to Montreal. The chicken was so perfectly charred and the sauce was so delicious without being overwhelming. I sadly couldn't try the poutine as I'd literally just finished eating at La Banquise (lol) but it looked amazing. I didn't think the Portuguese egg tarts were that great, but I'm used to the chinese style tarts so maybe this is a personal preference thang"}
{"text":"J'ai eu échos de l'excellent poulet servi par ce restaurant mais n'ai jamais eu l'occasion d'y aller. Ayant prévu un picnic dans le parc Lafontaine quoi de mieux que de prendre deux poulets entiers (parfait pour 6 personnes). Sur le site il est indiqué ceci: ''Notre poulet est toujours rôti à la perfection et servi avec frites ET salade!'' En fait, au moment de payer je comprends qu'il n'y a ni frites ni salade venant avec les poulets entiers. Pas très clair, surtout qu'on paie le plein prix (14$ si je ne me trompe pas). Toutefois, je dois avouer que je n'ai pas été déçue de la qualité. Le poulet est tendre, fondant en bouche et bien assaisonné. La sauce piquante qui vient avec est excellente et pique juste correctement la bouche :) Les frites sont un régale et la salade correcte avec sa sauce qui fait penser à Kraft. Je recommande ce restaurant on peut y manger sur place, sur la terrasse ou prendre pour emporter. Vous pouvez même commander à l'avance par téléphone !! Je n'ai pas essayer la poutine mais je peux vous dire qu'il s'agit de mon prochain choix, elle a l'air incroyable. PS finissez en beauté avec leurs natas (tarte aux oeufs portuguaise)."}
{"text":"Great find! Excellent food and so reasonably priced! If we lived in Montreal, we'd be headed here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Le poulet est délicieux! Mais le service est bête,les deux caissières toussent dans les assiettes et on se fait répondre très bête qu'il n'est pas possible de remplacer la frite par une poutine. Le prix excellent pour la grosseur de l'assiette! Faudrait seulement revoir le service aux clients! Aucun service aux tables, style cafétéria efficace."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great portions, delicious food, and reasonable prices. The evening we came here, there was a long line, but it moved pretty quickly. The only reason I am only giving this restaurant 4/5 stars is because I had to ask three times for no onions in my salad, and still there were onions in my salad. I get that they are super busy and it gets very loud, but a little attention to my request would have been cool. Other than that hiccup, this place is a gem.   P.S. They were sold out of their regular tarts (pastel de nata) by 7pm, so we settled for the coconut one. I personally don't like coconut, but my bf loved it.   P.S.S. If you know what you want, call ahead! You can skip the line if you order in advance."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for poutine and spicy portugese roast chicken. I really don't think I need to say much because everyone else will tell you the same thing. There is a reason why there's always a frigging lineup (though that has rarely deterred me from waiting for chicken)   Everything is perfectly spiced. I've also had the grilled calamari and it is awesome delicious! Go just before you get hungry and you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Juicy, tender, yummy fries (crispy outside, potato-ey insides)  Winter and at an odd time (330pm) It was practically empty.   Huge portions - 1/2 chicken platter and small poutine to share for 2   Easy ordering since there were limited choices (a good thing!)  Hot sauce was not as hot as I imagined but the chicken was falling off the bone!  Great poutine!  Natas was also great!   We came starving and left stuffed - didn't manage to finish our fries /:"}
{"text":"The portion size is Huge! It was absolutely delicious and enough to share between two of you are not ravenously hungry. The chicken is very tender and  isn't crazy spicy, though it does have a bit of a kick and may leave your lips tingling. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of being introduced to this place by and friend locally and was amazed by the flavor it had to offer. I ordered the Poutine with Sao Jorge cheese, chicken and chorizo which blew me away. The unique and authentic Portuguese flavors were offset by a base layer of fries in a healthy portion and a very affordable price (get the small). The flavors here are something I can't compare to anywhere else. Must try place and expect to return often. Delicious!"}
{"text":"tl;dr - eating at this place made me feel guilty, because I felt like I was stealing away this amazing, hearty meal at such a low price. A must go.  I literally adjusted my eating schedule to avoid Ma Poule Mouillée's long lines; when I came at around 4 during two workdays, there was no line at all.   The half-chicken meal is wonderful on all fronts. We went for half fries and half potato balls. The potato balls have a really unique texture and taste. I believe it had a hint of saffron, but the ladies working at the front didn't tell me the seasonings so it's all speculation. The fries were also great; crispy and thick in all the right places. The chicken is also amazing! The spicy sauce is a must-get; it's not just one-dimensional heat that I believe Romados has. Instead, it's a pretty light sauce with a deep flavor accompanied with heat. The salad was also outstanding; fresh vegetables and a yummy honey-mustard-esque dressing.   Every aspect of our meal was perfect, and we were astounded by the value and taste. People working there are friendly towards tourists and seem really happy. This place is great."}
{"text":"There once was a man from Romados Who suffered a chicken overdose But when he recovered  He quickly discovered A new spot had emerged in his comatose.   Ma Poule Mouillé is a relatively new chicken spot right across from La Banquise. It's brightly lit, has a clean interior, and pumps out some of the best chicken on Rachel East, probably due to the fact that it's run by a former Romado's employee.   Portions are huge and are relatively inexpensive given how much you get. The combination of awesome value and awesome taste gives this place a big 4 stars."}
{"text":"The Portugal fried chicken n fries !? Combination to die for ! Was the best food I had in my trip to Montreal !"}
{"text":"Ma Poule Mouillee is located in the heart of the Plateau and serves up Portuguese chicken.  It's right next to Parc Lafontaine and it is an excellent spot to come in summer to pick up some food for a picnic in the park.  If the weather doesn't allow you to eat outside there is plenty of seating in the restaurant which has a casual, laid back vibe to it.  The small poutine might not look like much but looks can be deceiving!  I actually struggled to finish it since it's packed with chicken and cheese curds.  The chicken was a little on the dry side but I did enjoy every other aspect of the poutine.  They packed loads of curds into it and that is always my favourite part of a poutine.  The fries were thick-cut and well seasoned and everything was loaded with gravy.  It had all the components of an excellent poutine.  If you're still hungry after a huge meal they also have a variety of baked goods including pastel de natas, Portuguese egg tarts, which were pretty tasty.  Pricewise it was pretty reasonable.  A small poutine, Coke Zero and pastel de nata came to $10 and I was very full when all was said and done.  The service was also really quick and I had my order in no time at all.  I must admit that there was some luck to that though as shortly after I had paid a small lineup had formed."}
{"text":"Food:10/10 really good, I'm definitely going there again. Portions are huge.   Price is amazing. 2 meals a big bottle of water cost 21$  Con: Hard to find a spot to sit. Be prepared to wait or consider take out."}
{"text":"i'm going to say it, I don't like poutine...till I've had this. The best poutine I've ever had, we got a regular chicken chorizo poutine and it was smothered in gravy and freshly roasted chicken. A must visit in Montreal!"}
{"text":"The smell, taste, portion and satisfaction from the meals here are off the charts. My family ended up here since we found out that La Banquise closes really early during the holiday season (bummer).   We ordered 1 large poutine for my sister and me and 1 small poutine for my dad.   That was a very poor mistake on our behalf. 1 large poutine is more than enough to feed 3 people. We were all struggling to finish our portions and admitted defeat.  The chicken is juicy, well-seasoned, and aromatic. The gravy was also very flavourful, which complimented the cheese curds nicely. My favourite part was the sausage though. Those little nuggets were full of flavour and I kind of wanted a whole sausage afterwards.  Be warned, it is a little bit on the salty side due to all the well-seasoned components.  All in all, my family and I would come back in a heartbeat!  TL;DR Portions are huge for the price! Poutine is heaping with meat, cheese curds, and gravy. Cholesterol beware."}
{"text":"I craved poutine and headed to the area. I skipped the long line across the street & came here. I had the Portuguese poutine. I was HUNGRY so I thought I'd order the large. I should've brought friends because it's *HUGE*. After seeing other folks with the \"small\" - I realized my mistake.   It's a casual place. You walk in, order, pay and then find a seat (if there are any open). Be prepared to get your order to go. (If you're like me and you mistakening order the large - they'll happily provide you a to-go box).  One thing that really impressed me was when I requested water - I was offered an entire pitcher. And I was solo. This never happens. Usually I get a shot-sized glass that I have to ration. For such a casual, and almost always busy place, this was a treat.  Check it out. The food is good. It's reasonably priced. And you won't be waiting in a long line."}
{"text":"OMG this place is so good!! The food is delicious,  it is so affordable and there's also a seating area outside. It is worth waiting in line for! Don't worry... the lineup goes by pretty fast.  The portions are huge!! I had the small poutine which comes with chicken and chorizo. Trust me when I say that if you are eating the poutine by yourself you need to get the small.  The small is so big that I only ate half and took the other half home. My bf ordered the half chicken platter which comes with salad and fries. He also couldn't finish his plate. I tried the chicken and it was so juicy. You also have the option of adding a spicy sauce. It wasn't very spicy but it makes everything taste better. I wish I could buy a bottle n bring it home. I liked it so much I asked for more sauce to take home with me. My bf said the salad was good too. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It takes a lot of balls to setup shop directly in front of La Banquise and serve Poutine.  But they won their bet - I actually prefer the poutine at Ma Poule Mouillée over that of La Banquise.  The poutine at Ma Poule Mouillée is PERFECTION.  It's so good, it makes me want to try other things on the menu, but I just can't. I want the poutine every time.  The chorizo, Portuguese chicken and hot sauce are the elements of a perfect naughty food dream.  Just thinking about the poutine makes me want another one right now.  Better yet - the prices are totally reasonable and the portions humongous. I love everything about this place."}
{"text":"La meilleure place à Montréal pour manger du portugais. Les prix sont ridiculement bas, les assiettes sont généreuses et tout est délicieux. Mon coup de coeur: le petit Talbot (sandwich au poulet). Seul point négatif: Prévoir une attente de 30-45 minutes facilement à l'heure du souper."}
{"text":"Patron DETESTABLE et d'une impolitesse sans nom et c'est vraiment dommage, car avec un rapport qualité/prix imbattable et un service rapide, Ma Poule Mouillée a tout de la formule gagnante ; la preuve en est que j'y vais (ou plutôt y allais) très souvent.   Alors pourquoi une telle note ? Tout simplement parce que dès 21 h 40, après que le patron soit venu voir tous SES CLIENTS en terrasse pour leur dire qu'il fermait à 22 h, monsieur a commencé à tourner autour de chacune des tables pour les empresser de partir. Les allers-retours étaient constants. A partir de 21h50, il s'est mis à côté de la table où je me trouvais avec un ami et nous a regardé fixement, debout, jusqu'à ce que nous décidions de partir, fortement agacés. Un sentiment plus que partagé par les autres clients et dont certains disaient même à haute voix qu'il aurait au moins pu les laisser finir leurs plats avant de les mettre à la porte, comme des malpropres.  Certes, la journée de \"the big boss\" fut sûrement longue (la mienne aussi !), mais quand on n'est pas capable de tenir la distance, mieux vaux fermer les cuisines plus tôt et offrir un service qui donnera envie aux clients de revenir et de ne pas écrire un tel billet.  Si j'y retourne ? Malheureusement non et il est vraiment dommage qu'une seule personne (d'autant plus le patron) ruine les efforts de toute une équipe qui travaille très dure et dans des conditions plus que difficiles."}
{"text":"Spontaneously stopped by for a late lunch, after debating between La Banquise and L'Avenue - both also in the area.   Opted for Le Louis Cyr, the 1/2 chicken with fries + salad ($11), and Bon, Les Portugais Font De La Poutine, the poutine with chicken and chorizo ($8).   Everything was delicious and came in enormous portions. The Peruvian style grilled chicken was juicy and flavourful. Poutine was on par with Montréal expectations.  Highly recommend the Sumol drink to go with your meal. It's like a Portuguese version of orange crush (less sugary, more fizzy) that went really well with the heavier food.  For a meal and a half for 2 for under $30, come here with an appetite and you won't be disappointed. Only regret was not trying their Portuguese tarts."}
{"text":"J'adore ce resto! Le poulet est trop bon et les desserts aussi! Le seul point négatif est qu'ils ne servent pas de bière!"}
{"text":"Amazing Portuguese rotisserie chickens. Well-seasoned, moist, and roasted on a charcoal rotisserie, which made the skin crispy but not burned. It's deliciousness itself. We ordered the whole chicken and a large plate of potato balls for our family of 2 adults and 4 kids. The chicken was gone in less than 10 minutes. That tells you how good it is. My kids didn't need any prodding to finish their food this time. My husband can't say enough of the sauce they poured on top of the chicken. It's not spicy but very flavorful and complimentary to the chicken. The potato balls were fun to look at, but a bit bland on their own. I also got their Portuguese tarts. They are different from the Chinese egg tarts. The \"cup\" that holds the custard has the texture of a croissant/puff pastry. I wish I knew more French because there was a bit of language barrier with the staff initially. If I get a chance to visit again on this trip, I would like to try #8 on the menu: poutine with rotisserie chicken on top! Now that sounds heavenly."}
{"text":"If you love chicken, then this is a perfect place! Their chicken is juicy and their potatoes are similar to what my grandmother used to make. The portions are huge, so you may want to share a plate with a friend. Their poutines are pretty good too, full of chorizo and cheese and meat. If you want to dine in, they have a small cute terrace outside, however, I have seen a lot of people picking up their take out orders too. I am still not sure whether I prefer Romados or this place, both are on my favorite chicken places list."}
{"text":"Let me say I was pretty impressed eating here! It was very affordable and very big servings. The chicken and spicy sauce was delusion. Good flavors and very tender with a kick. Their pork is also very tasty. Of course I ordered the poutine and it was amazing. The gravy was creamy and very flavorful. Even their sides of rice and potato were really good. They sale pastry up front and they are great as well. Staffs are very nice too! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Lets start with the humongous portions! Wow!! SO some hungry and order less and you would still walk out having over-eaten! It was my first time to Canada, so I had to try poutine and someone suggested that we try out Ma Poule Mouillee. So, we got in line- 45 minutes later, we managed to get inside. Okay, guys, if you have not been here before- read this carefully: There are 2 entrances to this establishment. One, where you will see the line, and the second is where the outside seating is. And here is how you order and eat here- Once you get inside, you place your order at one counter; you make the payment at another counter and you get called when your food is ready. There are no servers here- so you got to look out for a space to sit yourself! And we noticed a lot of people entering through the next door and joining their friends/random people on tables and just randomly walking up to the ordering line and getting the food. So basically cutting the line and wait of 45 minutes!  Okay, now that I have ranted about how I felt cheated, lets talk about the amazing, amazing food here! We did not pay heed to the previous reviews here and ordered half plate poutine (be careful to request no meat as every poutine option here has some or the other form of red meat) and a half chicken thighs. Now every order comes with a mountain of fries!! So we dig in and every bite is soo delish!! Crispness at its perfection! But we did end up eating only half of what we ordered!  Now, we also got a couple of pastel de nata which are portuguese custard tarts. We ate those later with coffee and were bite sized delights!"}
{"text":"Came to this place last thursday and I will definately be back! As we arrived, we saw a line up but we got ourselves a table. We had the chorizo/chicken poutine (which is to die for!) and the other had the typical chicken plates. The portions were huge so arrive hungry or maybe share your plate.  All I can say about the food is YUM YUM YUM! Everything was fresh and delicious.  I think this is one of the best portuguese joints I've been to so far. A bit busy, but worth the wait! RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"Like many others, we ended up here because of the long, long line outside La Banquise across the street. We were 4 adults and 2 3-year-olds, had just spent the morning skating and sledding and working up an appetite, and were not going to wait for the kids to start crying in the cold. But, we'd already (foolishly) promised them poutine, so when we saw it on the menu of Ma Poule Mouillée, we knew we had a winner. We were afraid the place was a bit more upscale than we'd bargained for, because it looks somewhat swanky from the outside (and advertised being a \"rotisserie portugaise urbaine\") but in fact it was very comfortable and cozy inside.  We settled into a table, and ordered a whole chicken, a Portuguese poutine, and a salad. In about 30 seconds, we had food in front of us. Piles and piles of amazing, delicious, steamy hot food. That alone is worth a lot.  Like others have mentioned, the food didn't have as much kick or smoky rotisserie flavor as we'd expected, but for our purposes, with the kids in tow, it was perfect. My son devoured every piece of chorizo he could find in the poutine. A surprising, but delicious combination of chicken, chorizo, and the standard poutine fare of cheese curds, fries, and gravy.   Our bill was $30. All the menu prices, which were reasonable to begin with, had the taxes included! We fed 6 people (ok, 2 were kids, but still!) for $30, and were all very, very satisfied.   Thanks, La Banquise, for being over-hyped and over crowded. Glad we didn't end up there, and found Ma Poule Mouillée instead!"}
{"text":"Dear Ma Poule, you had me a spicy sauce... before I traveled to Montreal for work I had put together a list of local eateries that I was determined to try before I left. Searching through Yelp this one place kept coming up, a true Montreal treasure as on blogger wrote, so of course I had to go.   Night 1 of my visit I made the 35 min metro trip, followed by a 10 min walk, followed by a 20 min wait... it was worth every second, every penny. Now I had never heard of Poutine before, much less tasted it, but the moment that I opened my box of warm spicy Portuguese styled Poutine I was in love. The fries were fresh, the sauce was somehow sweet and spicy at the same time, the meat was roasted to perfection. Phenomenal. One of the best and most noteworthy meals I have ever had.    Ask for the house special, half portion is pretty large and make sure to get something to drink, the food is hearty. Ma Poule, I will be back for you one day."}
{"text":"Meilleure rotisserie à Montreal! Portions copieuses. La poutine poulet est exellente. Generalement line up pendant l'heure du souper. Quelques place en interieur. À tester au moins une fois! Prix tres correctes"}
{"text":"The poutine was delicious with very good quantity for the price you pay. The seating is great with a great staff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Two words : DO IT.  I don't think there is any chicken restaurant in Montreal that can compare to this one- especially for the price you'll pay and the quality of food you'll get.   For a bit over 10$, you can have a giant plate with a full chicken breast, delicious crispy fries and salad. For an extra dollar you can get the half chicken. The spicy sauce they put on it is also to die for.   Expect to wait a bit in line. At pretty much any time of the day, there is a big chance that you see a line waiting to order at this restaurant. You can call to get it prepared in advance and pick it up directly at the counter is you're the impatient type. Otherwise, it usually goes pretty quickly (5-15 min max)."}
{"text":"Amazingly soft chicken and huge portions!!!! Medium sized fries are almost 3-4 large McDonald's fries. Friendly staff as well! Always a line up!"}
{"text":"Saw it from afar and wasn't sure what it was. Lining up across at La Banquise for over an hour in the cold didn't sound too pleasing. So once we found out it was mostly bbq Portuguese chicken, we hoped over and waited about 25 minutes before we could order. The style is line up, including out the door, order from a selected menu and then pay.   The best part: taxes are included!!   Happy:  I had the chicken salad and it was bigger than I imagined. It came with lots of juicy chicken pieces. Not dry at all. As the resto name suggested, \"my wet chicken\". Also, tomatoes, shredded carrots and red onions added a real nice touch. It was a large portion! My partner had the chicken sausage poutine and it didn't disappoint at all. Too much fries for one person. I picked some out.   Not happy:  Of course, the wait time to order your food. The sitting environment was limited and crowded. Basically, eat and go.     Verdict:  a must try and I loved my meal for just $10. It must have stole some businesses away from La Banquise. Definitely will go back when I'm in Montreal!!!!"}
{"text":"We picked up sandwiches with fries and salad to take to the park. Well, we were nearly at our chosen spot when we realized we hadn't been given forks. Yes, they are sitting right on the counter, but when I order food to go and am given a take out bag, I think everything ought to be included in that bag.   So we rushed back to the restaurant for forks, knives, and napkins, got alllll the way back to our spot.... 15 minutes have elapsed since we've picked up our food... And we realize we have no ketchup or mayo for our fries. Never mind though, because the fries they gave us were old. I know from fries, alright? And these guys were made, never picked up, and thrown back in the dryer to heat up, making them both greasy and dry, and hard in spots.   The chicken sandwich was similarly dry and very plain. The only redeeming item was the pork sandwich, succulent and oozing flavour. The salad was simple but good, but then dessert was a total flop. I ordered a regular natas and got a coconut one... My husband ordered a custard filled lobster tail and complained about dry pastry and a tail that was not fully filled.   Super lame experience overall. I'm not saying I wouldn't go back, but I think they need to get it together. If you're going to offer take out, that ought to be as complete an experience as eating in the restaurant, and the onus can't be on the client to make sure you do your job right."}
{"text":"One word yum! And so cheap. Full chicken, one \"small\" poutine and a side salad for 23 bucks.. get out of here.   First of all, the place has the amazing bbq chicken with a sauce you will get addicted too. Second of all I ordered the small poutine... turned out to be more than I can eat.. and it comes with chicken and chorizo. There is an option for large but you can feed a family of 5 with that... and I eat a lot. Even the 3 dollar side salad was big.   Portions are huge and yummy and to be honest you can get a crazy banquise style poutine for 7 bucks... sold.   Id recommend calling and picking up your order... it can get quite busy."}
{"text":"great atmophere, easy to read menu, the crispinest of the chicken is perfectly balanced with the creamy and perfectly spiced sauce. I ordered the half chicken with salad and patatoes, the portion is huge really should specify to reduce the amount of fries next time it is such food waste, just watching people eat i don't anyone who finished the fries. The salad dressing was way too oily( common to all portoguese chicken spot). We also had the poutine with choriso and chicken, the chorizo is nothing special too salty i had one bite of a mix of chicken, gravy, chorizo and fries and it was enough. I am gluten intolerant and the cashier said there's absolutely no gluten anywhere when obviously there was in the gravy and the spicy sauce so i was sick for the night. The last but not the least: Mille feuille was a party in my mouth, not too sweet, a generous double layer of custard, not too much dough and the chocolate glazing adds the perfect amount of creaminest to it. Comparable to the Mille feuille from Moishes, which is the best one i had so far. Will be back for the chicken and mille feuille. Cheers."}
{"text":"I know the poutine here isn't necessarily done in the most traditional way, but my god, it's the best I've ever had. They offer Portuguese spiced chicken and chorizo atop a mountain of fries; if the quality doesn't wow you, first of all, you're crazy, but secondly, the portion size will make you a believer. You can comfortably split a large poutine and leave fully satisfied. We went overboard and got a full chicken to go with it. Leftovers!  You can buy a jar of their signature sauce for $5, though the one I got was hand-sealed, and a bit leaky. Carry it upright and get it home safe!"}
{"text":"We shared a Louis St-Cyr and small poutine and thought the portions were ginormous! The 30 minute wait was worth it, but I would've been satisfied with just the chicken plate. My husband thought the food was way too salty and greasy, I thought that it was perfect for an occasional indulgence."}
{"text":"Really puts la Banquise, just around the corner, to shame. For less than 10$, you can get the 'small' poutine and a drink!  The small poutine comes at a price of 7$, but it's probably the largest portion you'll experience safely -- if you order the regular portion at 12$, it comes with a one way ticket to the ER (it doesn't).  The quality of the poutine was not top tier, but the highlight is in its quantity... Generous portions rotisserie chicken and chorizo sitting on top of a huge platter of fries, and a sort of tasty gravy covering that pile of heart-attack-inducing food. Note: still better than poutine at La Banquise in every aspect.  As for chicken, it's less dry than the chicken at Romados, but certainly not very tender/juicy. As for sauce, Romados has a much more flavourful hot sauce than Ma Poule Mouillée.  I'd go back for their daily seafood."}
{"text":"If I was a chicken I would like the be slaughtered here at Ma Poule Mouillée. Their poutine is the holy grail of chicken heaven. Even the prudest vegan from Plateau Mont-Royal would get wet eating here.  I feel bad for tourist waiting in line across the street at La Banquise, thinking they'll get the best poutine. La Banquise lost its touch, the fries are too burned up."}
{"text":"Massive servings. Share the poutine with chorizo and chicken between two. Spicy sauce included. Recommended by a local who said this place has the best poutine in the city."}
{"text":"The portions here are huge. That might be common place for poutine around here, but as a visitor I made a grave mistake. A friend and I both ordered a large poutine thinking that would be a good lunch. Turns out, we probably could have shared a small. I hated to toss out the leftovers because it was delicious, but we were out for the rest of the day and I wasn't keen on lugging around a twenty pound bag of fries and gravy with me. I loved the addition of the chicken and chorizo. Top notch poutinerie."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place so I HAD to try it, First off, oh my god the portions here are MASSIVE and I mean MASSIVE. I'm quite a big guy and I could only finish half of the plate. The chicken itself is dry in some parts and super juicy in others just as I expected lol. It seems that almost every chicken place I go to has decent/ good legs and thighs but dry breast meat XD. I also got a nata (Portuguese egg tart) and I can say it's the best version of it that I've had. I also picked up some of their bottled spicy sauce to bring back to NYC as a souvenir. All in all, good experience."}
{"text":"I never really understood how good rotisserie chicken was until I tried Romados. I grew up on St-Hubert chicken and the occasional Scores - Suburban life for the win - and there is a reason I stuck mostly to the chicken fingers through my teenage years. The classic chicken was generally too dry and not as flavourful as I wanted. Finally I moved downtown and then I discovered the beauty of Portuguese rotisserie. Moist and packed full of spicy flavour - finally proper chicken! Living close to Romados over the years gave me great opportunities to indulge when the craving hit. However, over the past couple of years, I've been hearing that another place in the plateau was given them a run for their money. That sounded impossible to me but given the co-owner of this new place worked at Romados for 20 years, it definitively peaked my interest. Last week, after a long Friday class nearby, I stopped over at Ma Poule Mouillee to give them shot.  If you've been to Romados, you will recognize the set-up. Take-out counter - you wait in line, watch the chicken cook on the massive grill behind the counter and you pay at another counter where a bunch of Portuguese pastries are on display as well. It's simple but as a take-out/quick service option, it's works well. Decor-wise, that have certainly put more effort into creating a nicer sit-down space compared to Romados but frankly it's doesn't really matter in this context. The food is the key.  For my first visit, I went with their \"Louis Cyr\" - 1/2 chicken with salad and fries. The classic combo. First off, huge portion for the price. I was surprised at just how much food I got for 11$ - a mountain of fries and a very sizeable half-chicken. The salad was classic side dish for Portuguese chicken and the fries were great as well - dense, tender and crispy - but let's be honest.... it's all about the chicken. I never thought I'd say this.... but I think they have Romados beat. The chicken was juicy and tender, super moist and so enjoyable. Add to that their spicy sauce slathered over the chicken and you have a heck of a chicken to enjoy.  They do have a few other option including a ridiculous poutine that I couldn't justify ordering on top of the chicken. However, I did take the opportunity to order one of their chorizo sandwich to eat the next day. Beautifully smoky and spicy chorizo sliced in between a soft roll and covered with the same spicy sauce as the chicken, the sandwich was a great lunch the next day.  And because they had some pastries, of course I needed a natas. Pretty good version to enjoy - the crust was thin and crackly with a nice torched top, the custard had that crème brûlée texture with a strong vanilla note. Always a good way to finish a meal.  Ma Poule Mouillée has got this chicken thing down. If anyone you know says they don't like roasted chicken, simply bring them here and watch them realized the error of their ways. Portuguese chicken is a staple of the Plateau and is once again a reminder of the greatness of the diversity of Montreal. Now to find more reasons to visit the Plateau for lunch time....  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Enormous servings of succulent, delicious chicken!  I could even finish my salad, but wow, I really wanted to."}
{"text":"Came here on the enthusiastic recommendation of colleagues. But I should have just realized that roast chicken is not my cup of tea. I've never had a roast chicken that wasn't dry before, and this was no exception. However, it was GREAT value for the money and I really enjoyed being in a local hotspot.  The chicken is roasted over charcoal, which is wonderful and very enticing to watch - but I noticed with some dismay that the chicken they serve to you is pulled from a drawer beneath the grill - they collect all their cooked chicken in those bins for serving. I think they could have been roasted a shade less time, and if they plucked them straight from the grill onto your plate it would have been a lot more delicious - and hotter!  I ordered the Combo Véronique, which came with a chicken leg and a segment of chouriço, as well as fries and salad. The chouriço was tasty but cold and very, very salty.   I think the best part was the fries. They were delicious - and seasoned! My colleagues told me to make sure I got the hot sauce and I'm so glad I did, because it was heavenly over the awesome fries. The hot sauce was not very hot at all, but tasted like a garlicky butter with a very subtle kick. That was the best part of the meal by far.  I also got a passionfruit soda, and a nata tart per my colleague's recommendation. I really enjoyed the soda because we don't have anything like it in Toronto, and it is not too sweet. The nata...also another one of those things that should have realized and accepted is just not my thing. But it was well made and would make any nata fan happy.  Overall I'm glad I came and braved the long line, but not my cup of tea.   Had I not been alone, I would have been interested to try their poutine! I heard good things about it and it's MASSIVE and it looked good!"}
{"text":"I hope the people of this great city appreciate the availability of exceptional ethnic cuisine like this. Coming from the culinary desert known as the American Midwest I long for fresh, quality prepared  foods such as this. The experience of waiting line with people from all over the world (mostly younger) is just icing on the cake.  The photos speak for themselves on what to expect and you won't de disappointed on flavor and certainly not on quantity. The mixed salad served with the chicken and fries is a nice balance and certainly aids in the digestion of the feast. My wife had the #3 which is 1/4 chicken with breast and I had the #2 1/2 chicken and it was more than we could eat. Note: there is an option for regular or spicy (both were great)."}
{"text":"Great! Only negative here can be the line...it never looks long, but it can take awhile. A great tip would be to call for take out a bit before you arrive and eat in the parc. You'll skip the line :)"}
{"text":"Try their take on a Poutine, but make sure you strap on the feedbags.  It is great fries with their signature chicken plus chorizo, slathered in a spicy (read flavor not heat) gravy and chorizo....mmm"}
{"text":"Poutine is awesome, plates are large and cheap. However, the chicken caused serious competition over the plate between my friend and I, wish We had ordered more."}
{"text":"I went there twice this week.  The price point is great. I have to say not too impressed second time. A bit overrated.  I think the Chicken itself is better at Romados.  More flavor and crispier. I do like the ambiance better here and parking seems to be easier.  I asked for rice instead of fries the second time as I did the first. This time he said no rice without explanation. English is their third language after all so I didnt inquire why.   My big problem with both of these Portugesse chicken restaurants is that they lack sanitary practices.  I would never order a sandwich because they use their dirty hands w/o gloves.  Not one employee wears glove at either place.  I even saw the cashier touch somebodys fries with bare hands. That is unacceptable to me. No body will touch my food while in front of me.    The Fucking Quebec government likes to control everything. Maybe they should implement better food handling regulations."}
