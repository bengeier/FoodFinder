{"text":"I been wanting to try this place for a minute since it opened. Its very clean and has a nice art decco vibe. I ordered scampi the loaded fries, shrimp and some wings. I want to try a little of bit everything. The scampi were some of the best Ive ever had. They were huge and perfectly cooked. The seasoning for all the food was delicious. Chicken wings were delicious the sauces were amazing. Definitely check it out. New faithful customer."}
{"text":"Great service, wait wasn't too bad but I probably should have ordered over the phone. Food was good, very flavorful and not too spicy for people who don't like a lot of spice. My family got wings and fried shrimp and they also enjoyed it. I got shrimp frites and I loved the sauce on my fries. Would definitely recommend to locals."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this new restaurant in my neighborhood but I was disappointed. Cajun/Creole cuisine should be flavorful. I ordered catfish which was not seasoned at all and was fried in flour instead of cornmeal which just added to the bland taste. I ended up throwing the entire meal in the thrash. I wish them much success as a new business but this was just not good!"}
