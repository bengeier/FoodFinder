{"text":"Bel endroit pour étudier, prix abordables! Toutefois mon muffin était pas très frais.."}
{"text":"I was disappointed to experience that both the service & food quality are not consistently good. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week, it's definitely my go-to place for caffeine and snacks. I'm not a coffee connaisseur, but I definitely enjoy the occasional cappuccino. Mostly, I'm a huge fan of their chai lattés! So creamy and delicious, made with an actual tea bag(!) versus the nasty syrup other places will use. The staff are awesome, it's not often that in downtown Montréal you'll find staff who'll greet you by name! The fidelity card is great if you're a regular. (Credit cards require a minimum of 5$)"}
{"text":"Stationed at the hotel up the block, they naturally became my go to spot for decent coffee.  I couldn't find hazelnut brewed coffee within a walking proximity, but they were able to supplement with some syrup.  Which i didn't mind considering it's a 2 min walk from the hotel.  I became an instant fan of their almond croissant, had it almost daily during my stay.  They have an array of pastries which looked tantalizing.  I highly recommend them if you're on rue St. Denis. Also the morning barista is super friendly and cute even after spilling half my coffee by accident. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Excellent café et ambiance calme, parfait pour débuter une belle journée avec son journal, je vous conseil cette place ! ;)"}
{"text":"Coffee and pastry are both good! I had chocolate croissant. It's okay. Hope it can be fresher though. The atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Vraiment cute ! Un nouveau petit café tout juste en face de mon pavillon a l'UQAM. Enfin, je n'aurai plus a boire l'infect café filtre de la cafétéria !

Leurs lattés sont tellement bons ! Et que dire des pâtisseries. Les muffins sont super goûteux et vous avez le choix entre plusieurs saveurs dont orange et canneberge, graine de pavot citron et framboise, érable et pommes, etc. Ils sont copieux et rassasiants.

Les employés sont sympathiques et ont vraiment l'air d'aimer leur travail, on aime ça !"}
{"text":"Cute café near UQAM and CHUM hospital, coffee is delicious and they have a big variety of pastries; salty or sweet. I took a spinach and feta pastry, they warmed it up for me, it was awesome. Service is fast. Great place!"}
{"text":"Delicious cappuccinos (try the mocha, yum) in a nice little quiet atmospheric shop and wonderful friendly service. Definitely a nice place to sit and sip and read the paper or people watch out the window. Just a bit hidden but definitely worth finding. Had a tasty fresh chocolate croissant as well, be sure to check out the array of muffins!"}
{"text":"I really like the place! I have been there on a regular basis since they opened up in summer 2012. The owner told me back then that their concept was to be a pretty basic coffee shop where everything is cheaper than at the big chains all around in downtown. I was wondering if they would make the prices go up when they would start having more customers... but fortunately it did not happen :)  I usually get a latte (sometimes decaf), or a chai latte (made from real chai tea with a bit of honey on top--NOT from a sweet syrup like you would get in many other coffee shops). I'm also happy with what I get. They now have some lunch food (sandwiches, yogurts), which I have not tried, but their muffins and viennoiseries are always delicious, for a good price. The service is not rushed, but not too slow either. The one reason why I don't give 5 stars is because the neighborhood is not an exciting place. It's not a place that could have a nice little patio in the foreseeable future. If you're OK with sitting inside or taking your beverage to go, then yes, go there!"}
{"text":"C'est un beau comptoir café ! Je dis comptoir, car ce n'est pas vraiment le genre d'endroit adapter pour que tu reste sur place malgré les quelques chaises a l'intérieur. Par contre, le service  était très bon et le café et super bien situé dans le quartier latin."}
{"text":"Mmmm....decaf latte. That's honestly all I ever had at this cafe, but man it's good. It comes with a pretty leaf design too! They offer Felix and Norton tiny cookies and also pastries. My friend had a muffin and a cappucino, both which were good according to her. It was actually very quiet when I went which is a plus. Nothing I hate more than overcrowded coffee shops. 

Service is friendly. Oh! And they offer some salads and sandwiches/wraps as well. Located near UQAM, perfect for university students. I really recommend this place, it's a cute and quaint place."}
{"text":"Located near hotels and the UQAM campus, this cafe featured a good selection of pastries and beverages.  The assorted croissants and muffins were solid - not stellar. The coffee was good. It was pretty busy on a weekday morning with a combination of both tourists and locals."}
{"text":"J'ai découvert ce petit café pendant les 2-3 semaines de l'année où il est impossible de trouver du café dans les murs de l'UQAM. Bon service, bon café, lait de soya disponible moyennant un extra, quelques muffins et croissant pour grignoter et super décor. Bref, je vais certainement y retourner!"}
{"text":"Cozy coffee shop located near the Hotel St Denis. I tried both their hot chocolate and brioche and both were pretty good. The place is not very big but there was always plenty of seating space available and prices are affordable."}
{"text":"Arrêt café à côté de berri-UQAM qui change des grandes enseignes! Le design du café est pas mal, le vert lagon y est une couleur récurrente: les tasses, les luuminaires et l'emblème du cafe portent à chaque fois de petites touches de la couleur. Un mur peint en noir vous invite à choisir votre breuvage: espresso, latte, thé etc. Il y a également un frigo qui vous offre differentes boissons froides. Le café offre une selection de pâtisserie de chez première moisson et de chez régal matin. Sur le mur opposé vous retrouverez en grand le bom du café (j adore!) Petite note design: les étagères du bar sont faites de tuyaux :D vive la récup'!

L'ambiance y est cosy et relax. Les baristas sont bien gentils et attentionnés.  Il y a des tables hautes et quelques tables classiques. Mais pas de canapés comme je les aime tant ;) Le latte etait bien bon :D 

Bon spot en ville pour deguster un bon café!"}
{"text":"Pourquoi n'aie-je pas découvert cet endroit alors que j'étudiais à l'UQAM?
POURQUOI? Ah oui, parce qu'à cette époque lointaine, je ne yelpais pas. Tant d'années perdues dans l'innocence et la méconnaissance.

C'est très relax et c'est joli joli. Je ne m'attendais pas à quelque chose de si grand. 
Le café était vraiment bien, tout comme le petit biscotto. Prix abordables et barista adorable. Il y a plein de trucs à manger et à boire et pour vrai, c'est parfait pour les étudiants qui veulent flâner un peu en faisant leurs devoirs. 

Ça fait vraiment du bien de voir un aussi cool café dans le coin. Je vais me demander pendant des années pourquoi je ne connaissais pas son existence, lui qui est situé tout près de mon ancien département."}
{"text":"The perfect coffee spot....nice coffee, low prices, good space, great service. I wish I lived closer to it so I could come here every day. If you are anywhere near UQAM, this should be your first stop if the day."}
{"text":"Cafe 1880 is a smashin' place! Great for a quick coffee or for sitting down and working the day away. 

It's a hidden gem around the corner of Boulevard René-Lévesque and Rue Saint-Denis. It's a bit out of the way of the busy Rue St. Catherine, and so it's not crazy busy like other commercial coffee shops lik Starbucks (although they are still quite busy!).

The shop is decorated with a trendy, modern style. The baristas were also totally rad, and I had a short but cool chat with them. At least one of the baristas was extremely cute, too ;)

The coffee is really good (not the best, in my opinion) but definitely still more than deserving of frequent visits!"}
{"text":"Solid bet for very good second-wave coffee and sweets around the corner from Berri metro. Their espresso doesn't match Pourquoi Pas a few blocks away on Amherst, and you won't see bags of beans from a favourite third-wave roaster on offer, but that's not really the point. What you will find are quality baked goods, including great jelly-stuffed donuts for $1.25. (On those days when you are really winning at life, you may even find yourself here in the minutes before closing when they start clearing out the donuts at 2-for-1 prices.) The coffee holds its own with other quality second-wave offerings in town, like Olimpico, Café Vito or even San Simeon in Little Italy. It's less expensive than the average third-wave joint, too: as much as I love those spots, none of them will sell you a latte and a fancy baked good for under $5 like Café 1880 will, tax in. 

On a recent weekday afternoon, there were some fuzzy bearded gentlemen tapping away on their laptops and a clutch of teenagers chatting over coffee. There is a handsome window counter in polished wood and a few high tables with stools, as well as some regular tables with chairs. I wouldn't make this a destination for the coffee per se, but it's definitely a sure bet for study, work or chatting if you're in the area (or if your sweet tooth is showing)."}
{"text":"Great coffee at affordable price! Located right next to a university so pricing is much more affordable. 

I enjoy the more chocolaty old school coffee beans and this is exactly what Café 1880 serves."}
{"text":"I came here in mid May 2017. First, the place is small and for that reason can often get crowded. However, there is usually at least one table available. 

The coffee was great and service also great."}
{"text":"I stopped in just to find a place to get a coffee and check my email, though I was pleased to find they had good and cheap doughnuts! 

I thought the doughnuts were homemade - and at $1.25 for apricot doughnuts, that would be a deal. The second time I stopped in, I was disappointed that the doughnuts are just made by Premiere Moisson - a quebecois chain :/ 

It's still nice to grab a good doughnut that's cheap in the area, but the coffee isn't great (like many places in Montreal) - otherwise this place would not earn 3 stars."}
{"text":"Great selection if coffees and sweets!
Mochachino was really good and the après espresso was perfect!
The atmosphere was great as was the friendly service and down to friendly owner! 
I would definitely would go out of my way to return. ;)

I see there is Wifi listed but wasn't evident would be a nice plus if it was."}
{"text":"Located near UQAM campus, on the corner of René-Levesque and St-Denis, this little coffee shop serves some good coffee and sweet breakfast. You can even get fresh donuts and cronuts. 

They have free wifi, and serve some healthy, delicious lunch options such as salads and wraps from Aux Vivres so you can stay there all day for work, or study. The service is friendly as well. Overall, if you're looking for a good cafe in the area, give this a try."}
{"text":"Bonne ambiance un petit Cofee Shop sympathique, vu que je travaillais au chum j'ai pas pris de latte mais le filtre est bon. Bonne muzik. 1880 ma rendu heureux pour ma journée. 7 /10"}
{"text":"Beau café local indépendant dans le Quartier Latin sud, enfin, un café style plateau avec de bons lattés dans ce coin de la ville. On dirait le même style que le Névé, choix de couleurs, cafés,..... Bon service + wifi gratuit."}
{"text":"The café just perfect, they even add the suger (if you want) before they add the milk to your latte. The pastries on the other end may look great but felt a bit old. I was there before 8 so maybe I got yesterday's croissant, on the other end it is even worst so I will assume either I got a bad one or their supplier is not that goid...just stick to the coffee and you will be hapoy"}
{"text":"On a Saturday, there is almost no one in this cafe. The perfect place to study. I don't know about the weekdays, but I liked this place. My espresso was good, my spinach pastry was good, the paintings on the wall were good, the colours were good, a beautiful little place. It's not very big. People come often to get a coffee and go. Everything was good! I suppose this place must be crowded during weekdays? Who knows! Good stuff here!"}
