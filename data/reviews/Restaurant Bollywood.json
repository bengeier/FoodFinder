{"text":"3.5 stars or possibly more. I tried their chicken tikka masala ($12). They actually have two types, one that's nut based & a bit creamier and the more traditional one. I chose the former. The nut flavor is subtle but it was definitely different than others I've had. The sauce was yellow so it might've had turmeric. It wasn't spicy and very creamy. Tandoori white chicken pieces were used. I also had a saag palak paneer ($8) which was pretty standard and good. Naan was nice and fluffy. I tried the tandoori roti which by contrast is a bit stiffer and has an air pocket inside. I preferred the Naan. Prices are pretty fair as are the portions. The decor is very nice inside and there are quite a few tables and some parking. Good for groups or a date."}
{"text":"Restaurant Bollywood opened in Feb.19th, I heard of this place a while back just never got my chance to make my way there. I am frankly quite excited to have new Indian restaurants in the South Shore. This restaurant is located in St-Hubert /Brossard with a parking lot (best to drive here).  The restaurant is beautiful! The decor reminds me of a spice isle with Indian imported statues while relaxing music plays in the background. They do pick up (10% off orders), catering, cooking lessons as well as casual dining in seating up to 85 ppl.  The menu has a wide variety of veg and non-veg options. The combos area perfect for 2 or more ppl. We went with combo 1-chicken pakoras were replaced with Manchurian (Chinese fusion Indian veggie fritters), veggie pakoras -comes in 4 pieces (were really good), chicken tandoori x4 pieces, butter chicken in a light cream sauce, basmati rice, Naan bread, garden salad, chai and gulab Jamun honey balls for dessert. We ordered a side of shahi paneer tikka masala which is a creamy cheese dish in a nut sauce - my favourite.   They have a full bar including house wines which are very affordable. Definitely worth the trip here with family and friends!"}
