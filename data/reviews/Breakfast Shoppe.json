{"text":"For years and years there was no place in Ambridge to get a really, really great breakfast.  Then I stumbled upon the Breakfast Shoppe.

This place is great in every way.  The service and the food are top-notch.  It's as though they really care about what they are doing, while so many other local restaurants just slop things together.

I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"All the cliche's fit Great little hometown mom and pop resteraunt. The decore is plain like something out of a 1950's movie somehow familiar, friendly and reassuring. Great selection of hone made soup and specials change daily. Omelets are huge and expertly done and French toast my favorite  Staff is sparce but very attentive. Quick service so forget fast food this is the place for breakfast. Always  seems to be an old friend or two in there when I come in willing to swap stories about cars or local politics."}
{"text":"Good service. Low Prices. Food was really good.

Definitely a really good place to go for breakfast or lunch.

Not a lot of friendly places in that area. This one stands out though."}
{"text":"Always have been wanting to stop in this place but haven't had an opportunity because it's a Breakfast/Lunch establishment. Glad I finally did. Ordered a Breakfast Burger and it was very good. All ingredients seemed fresh and the service was excellent. The menu is limited but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Additionally the place is very clean. I'll definitely be back to this little Mom And Pop establishment."}
