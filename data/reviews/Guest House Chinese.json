{"text":"Guest House is one of East Yorks best hidden secrets. The appearance from outside can be described in one word, humble. The food suggests that it should have it's own T.V. series on A&E. They have a menu so large and extensive that I feel bad for the environment. But it is completely worth it. I have never had something from guest house that didn't leave me wanting more. From the basic fried rice, to chicken wings and fried pork, everything is good. And I recommend stopping by for one of their lunch specials which are such a good deal you'll think your reading it wrong. The General Tao chicken is not just your general Tao chicken. It's so good it could make the General salute. And the staff is very pleasant, always smiling and want to please you. The interior shows why it's a take out restaurant, it's your basic, white interior with some plants. Finally the prices are incredible. You can feed a family of 4 and have left overs for the next day. Overall I urge everyone to give Guest House a try, you won't be disappointed,"}
{"text":"This was my second time ordering take-out from this new business that opened up down the street.  They are a young family business where the Chinese food is plentiful.  I had the Singapore noodles the first time and it was the good dry curry of the Singapore noodles I normally get from a Chinatown location.  Also recently ordered the Chicken Fried rice for my son.  He loved it, and ate more than I've seen him eat in a while.   But even so, every order you have about 5 servings so be prepared for a lot of food.  Their kitchen is wide open, so you can see that their prep area is clean and well managed.  There is no decor in the place although they do look like they have comfy chairs.  If their lighting was not a bunch of fluorescents, they might attract more eat-in traffic.  But it's definitely a decent takeout location and well worth the walk over for pick up.   Welcome to the neighbourhood, Green Tea!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time recently and it was honestly the best Chinese food we have ordered in this area ever!  It was high quality and fresh! The meats were great and not fatty. Best of all the prices were very reasonable and the portions are great ! Beef ho fun was awesome as were the chicken balls and everything else !   Delivery was fast and friendly   I'll be ordering from here weekly  I wish I knew about it before"}
