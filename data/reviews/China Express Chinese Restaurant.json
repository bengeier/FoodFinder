{"text":"one of my favorite places to go for lunch and dinner.yummy...fresh...best chinese restaurant in pineville."}
{"text":"This is a quick take out chinese restaurant and comes with all the regular trappings of chinese menu. Went here last week along with my family and being vegetarian we ordered some bean curd tofu dish and some vegetable fried rice (these are the only two veg options here). I should say, both items were excellent and the service was great. The place was not crowded and the lady at the counter was taking many orders via phone. Am sure this place is quite popular for takeouts. Ambience is regular and standard (nothing exceptional). Very affordable options."}
{"text":"Ordered Kung pao shrimp and spring rolls.  Not my thing,  the kung pao \"sauce\" was the consistency of a light broth, (think flavored water).  I did boy care for the lack of body.   Three spring rolls were mushy and without flavor inside.   It was hot, it was fresh, the woman on the phone was responsive and helpful. The delivery service was great.  The diet Pepsi was exactly what I expected."}
{"text":"Great Chinese take out on the fly! Super friendly service and delicious food! Great prices too. I highly recommend it if you are in the Pineville, NC area."}
{"text":"I'm hard to please when it comes to food; especially when it's Chinese. Today I ordered take out from China Express and I'm very impressed. Food arrived fresh and hot and correct! I don't like onions and the chef took that into account with every entre that I ordered. This restaurant is now my official \"go to\" when it comes to Chinese take out from this point forward! Do yourself a favor and give them a try!"}
{"text":"We used to order delivery from this restaurant pretty often. The food is acceptable, nothing to complain about there. However, they are consistently unwilling to accommodate our requests to avoid the issues we kept having with the Styrofoam they use to package the delivery food in. Every time you order something fried, they put it straight from the fryer into a Styrofoam container without a liner of any sort. The hot food melts through the box, leaving holes and rendering all of the contained food contaminated and seriously toxic and inedible. You can taste the chemicals! Most of the dishes I always ordered were not fried, and also at times melted through the styrofoam. We've asked many times, that they either line the styrofoam, or use one of the sturdier containers that they use with certain dishes. They will only use those for specific dishes/sizes, even though they have the same capacity. They have never once accommodated our requests to avoid the styrofoam.   *update: they've recently started lining the styrofoam containers, so giving them another go :)"}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular about this place. Delivery was very fast but they charged my card twice. The food was pretty good nothing to write home about tho. Other than the cheese wontons those were delicious!!! This is the first Chinese place I've ordered from in Charlotte so I guess I have to keep searching."}
{"text":"Hunan chicken-lots of meat and vegetables excellent, steamed dumplings excellent, always consistent quality and flavor."}
{"text":"Been goin here for years. I'm a pineville native and this place set my standard on Chinese takeout. Aways great my parents love it as well. I always get house lo mein or general tsos. Always dank"}
{"text":"not a place you would want to eat in. but , it's got pretty good takeout or deliver food. the ribs are amazing and the chicken and rice soup is good and so is the fried rice and the egg rolls are good too."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and very speedy delivery. The shrimp are large with the hibachi shrimp special. Also they have a good gravy for the egg fo Yung. Only down side is the egg rolls are hot or miss. Over all beat Chinese food in Pineville."}
{"text":"I LOVE this take on traditional Chinese! I brought some co workers not too long ago, because I knew that they would like a consistent good meal. They thoroughly enjoyed themselves, and can't wait to come back the next time we're in town. We don't find ourselves in Charlotte that often but when we do, we make sure to stop by our new favorite Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"My favorite take out Chinese spot in Charlotte/Pineville!!! Been going here since I moved here 10years ago.  Food always the same...AWESOME!! Great taste, temperature, and fresh!! It's a great ran family business and always clean.  The couple that owns it are always friendly and easy to understand. Reasonable prices too!!  Oh and by the way...they have brown rice AND they have shrimp sauce/yum yum sauce. It's a little extra (maybe 35cents for a little cup?) but delicious!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese takeout place that I've found around the Ballantyne area. Doesn't look amazing on the inside but we never eat in. I usually order the chicken and broccoli and last time I went for the garlic shrimp. I'm always scared to try new things but I loved it! New favorite. The portions are huge. We often eat down for dinner and have lunch the next day too from one serving. We also order it with chicken fried rice which is way better than the pork fried rice most dishes automatically come with. Think it's $1 extra. They have the lowest prices of any Chinese food places we've been too around here."}
{"text":"This is such a good, inexpensive take out place. I can't eat too much from here anymore because of my gluten free diet. I find I don't have a reaction to the sa-cha chicken, yang chow fried rice, or the shrimp with lobster sauce. The sa-cha chicken with medium spice is so good. Everything is good. When I could eat them, the chicken wings, BBQ ribs bone-in, fried rice, Mongolian beef, general tsaos chicken, dumplings, crab Rangoon, schezuan beef, Hunan, sweet and sour, all so delicious. I've probably tried just about everything. They offer lunch and dinner combos. It's a good value for the price."}
{"text":"My favorite take out place in the area! I've had most of the items on the menu and haven't had a bad experience. The best items I've tried so far have been the chicken wings (my favorite appetizer!!!) and the General Tso's chicken. Portions are large so you really get your money's worth.   Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Simply put, NOT GOOD!!  A waste of money.. Very low quality chicken. The establishment did not try to make it right. I can say, I will NEVER! give this business my $$ again. I gave it 1 star because I had to rate it something. My wife's egg roll was desert dry."}
{"text":"This place is a staple in the Pineville area. If you ask anyone this is the go to for Chinese. They have amazing traditional dishes from their Orange Chicken to their Fried rice. You can't get much better. They also have very unique dishes and dishes of the day that you can't get anywhere else. I've had a whole fish here one day and it was out of this world. Very interesting spin on what I usually think when thinking Chinese. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Always go the extra mile to make sure you are happy with your food. Their sauce is great-- I always recommend paying for extra! If you haven't tried this I would say you need to asap!"}
{"text":"We got delivery from here the other night and it was not bad at all. We have the general tsos and broccoli and chicken dishes. Both were very hot upon arrival at my place. The gentleman was very nice. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"the food worth the price, very tasty, I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Everyone needs a good go to Chinese takeout place! This has become one of ours especially since they do delivery. Honestly, I love that you can get authentic Chinese dishes (like spicy fish and fermented veggies) in addition to all the classic American Chinese dishes (General Tso's is my all-time favorite). I highly recommend their crab Rangoon appetizer. Food is quick, service is good. Make It one of your cheap, fast weeknight go-tos."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and love a great Chinese take out restaurant.  We were very pleased with what we ordered. My husband loved the Sa Cha chicken  and I had the General Tso's chicken, which was great. We are looking forward to trying many other things in the year to come. The service was friendly and quick and the food was great"}
{"text":"Greasy, old food. The rice was old and soggy most of it was clumped together. The low mein smelled burnt and the cashier was not very friendly or helpful. I will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"No frills. No fuss. Typical fast Chinese food. Smelled very oily when I went in, but I wasn't deterred...yet. I got takeout, since I was in a hurry to bring nourishment to my family. Their prices are cheap, and our food was just ok. The egg rolls were sooo greasy. I mean, there was oil dripping out of the inside. Almost as if it had been taking a bath in grease. The fried rice was good, abc the chicken dish was just ok. My biggest complaint was that almost everyone in our family felt sick in some way after eating. Not pukey. But headaches and stomach cramps and weird neck pain. Could have been a fluke, but I am guessing MSG???   I don't normally like Chinese food (gasp! I know. Weird.), but a couple places in Charlotte made me like it again. This is not one of them. If you can handle the grease and possible high dosage of MSG, then by all means stop by."}
{"text":"If you come here thinking it's just another takeout place you are missing OUT! They have a secret menu with amazing authentic Chinese options. The owners were very patient in explaining them to me. My friend and I had the most delicious poached duck, crispy wings, minced pork with shrimp, and some type of greens. Everything was great and we had enough leftovers for another meal. Definitely a hole-in-wall that I'll be coming back to for my fix of authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend. Giving 2 stars instead of 1 just cause I've had worse.   1. Ordered at 7pm on a Wed. Took a little over an hour to delivery.  2. Boneless ribs weren't typical. It was just sliced pork with a sweet sauce on them. Not rib meat.   3. Sesame chicken. A pound of seeds. All I could taste. Very dry. Little sauce. Some funky tasting pieces in the mix. Don't expect all white meat.   4. Crispy noodles were actually tasty. Fresh made. But bags were COVERED in grease. I had to wash my hands just from opening the bag.  5. Rice was over cooked. Complete mush."}
{"text":"Place is stuck in a corner between Food lion and maccupuichu. The chicken wings and pork fried rice is on point the portions are decent for the price unless you wanted  a buffet like 2 min away.. Quick in and out service!! Its pretty plain inside but who cares Im just there for the food!!"}
{"text":"As Chinese delivery goes, which usually ranges from awful to meh, this place was impressive. Delivery was fast. The food was fresh and crisp; obviously had not been sitting around waiting to be scoops into delivery boxes. The portions were large.   My only complaint is that they mixed up one of my dishes, no big deal though. I'm definitely ordering from them again,"}
{"text":"It has to be mentioned here and the staff is extremely kind and warm the place smells terrific the food's great and thank you to the manager for the other evening helping me up I'll be back in there Merry Christmas to you and your wonderful staff thank you"}
{"text":"We've been ordering food from here for 15 years and it's still delicious. My husband loves their sweet and sour pork and chicken. I have always liked everything that they have, from the lo-mein to egg foo young."}
{"text":"We order from here all the time. Delivery is quick, the food is always good and hot. Have never gotten anything that wasn't good."}
