{"text":"Hardly lasagna! Meat sauce, pasta shells, a little bit of cheese sprinkled on top with absolutely no flavour would be an accurate description. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"Well, I've never had panini or pizza at Lenny's, but I've had their take-out lasagna meal, which has got to be one of the better deals on Italian food around. And they're not shy about it: there's huge signs advertising it which compete with the restaurant's own sign. I'll bet it snags its fair share of commuters coming along Dundas.

For twenty bucks, you can get a huge, fresh lasagna, salad, and garlic bread, which makes for a great (and apparently popular) instant meal to pick up on the way home. While the lasagna in the deal is your standard meat version, they make other varieties, and even bigger sizes for catering."}
{"text":"The quality has slipped of late. I brought home the lasagne special  and discovered that the layers of noodles had no sauce or meat or anything between them! 

To clarify, there are many layers of noodles, so every 7 or 8 layers had a little sauce but that was it. I mentioned this to the owner, the response was sorry but hopefully the next one will be better.

The special is often good, but when its not the owners take no responsibility.

I may try this place again, but not for awhile. I have difficulty supporting bad food and bad customer  relations."}
{"text":"Lenny's is apparently famous for it's take-out menu. You get the feeling for this as soon as you walk in. The dinning area is very small (sits about 18 at 6 or 7 tables) and there is a constant rush of people walking in and out for take out orders.

I ordered bruschetta and a Primavera pizza. Both were very large portions. The bruschettta was decent and topped with fresh, sliced oregano. The Primavera pizza was was topped with large pieces of prosciutto and artichoke. Nice portions but mediocre taste.

I got the feeling that everyone was a regular except for my table, which me us feel out of place. The small size of the dinning area coupled with the loudness of the reception area (receptionist loudly taking orders on the phone, customers picking up orders, paper bags being rumpled, etc...) made it feel more like a fast food joint than a nice Italian restaurant.

The meal was ok but I probably wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"Lenny's is ok. 
Ok.
By the way people rave about this place- I thought it would be absolutely delicious. It wasn't. It was OK. 
The take out special is good value.
It's convenient. 
The staff are pretty friendly- at least the woman who served me at the cash was. 
I think it's super popular because of the location. It's in a pretty terrible area- with not a lot of other options. 
Desperate times call for desperate measures- which is how I ended up there. I had messed up my own lasagna for a dinner party I was throwing-so I headed over for the pick up special. It was ok- but honestly- my husband makes better."}
{"text":"My family has been ordering from here for years.  The pizza is okay as I don't eat pizza usually but the veal parmesan sandwich is delicious!  Very filling and the bread is fresh.  Apparently they offer minestrone soup by the bucket."}
{"text":"I'm basing this review solely on the lasagna special that they offer from 4-6pm on the weeknights.  

When I read Wesley N's review, I should have ran for the hills but Lenny's is located in The Kingsway (a very established neighborhood in Etobicoke) so I couldn't quite understand how it could be open for years, have that customer base and be that dirty.  In any event, my husband had been bugging me to make lasagna for weeks but I convinced him to let's just try this place.

If you chose to go for the lasagna special, be sure to go closer to 4-5pm, as the parking lot is a little tricky to maneuver around when it gets busy.  However, the patrons were all very courteous and everybody waited their turn to get in and out.  It's a small, take-out restaurant that appeared to be very, very clean.  Contrary to the \"not recommended\" reviews on Yelp, I thought the customer service was excellent; they were friendly and I was in and out within five minutes.

All right, now for the lasagna itself.  Pros: noodles were cooked perfectly and it was hot and well packaged.  Cons: the noodle to meat sauce ratio was 75% (noodles) to 25% meat sauce; meat sauce had no flavor; lasagna did not hold its form due to no binding, such as cheese; there was just a little bit of some very low-grade mozzarella on top.  

Toronto is a very expensive city and I felt extremely ripped off.  My bad though for just assuming that it would be layers of tasty meat sauce, ricotta, parmesan and mozzarella.  It wasn't uneatable but we certainly didn't have second helpings - it was basically assembly line lasagna.  

I can't really justify giving them one star because I reserve that for restaurants with zero customer service and food that is repulsive.  However, I think they should be ashamed of themselves to offer such poor quality food and intentionally rob customers of their money.  The way they make those lasagnas in bulk, it probably cost them less than $1.00 for one - just because of all the low-grade and little ingredients it offered.  Will never return - consider my two stars generous."}
{"text":"The owners both - extremely unwelcoming and rude! When I asked when was the gelato made as there is no date on it, the owner Lenny said:  \"maybe 2 months ago and maybe 2 weeks ago... you don't have to buy it!\" I bought lasagna family combo - very far from good Italian food. Get Beretta's frozen lasagnas and you will enjoy full flavour and quality of meat. AVOID THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Lenny's was an absolute favorite of mine growing up and was a place that I was always excited to order from with my family. Just tonight we ordered three different pasta dishes and as I remembered there was fresh bread, a little dessert, and salad to go along with everything. 

Not sure how to write this without feeling even worse but as I was eating the salad and JUST finished remarking about how tasty the salad dressing was I opened my mouth slightly and a cockroach fell out onto my plate. I've never experienced that before and I just can't imagine ordering food from Lenny's again. 

So sad to have a childhood favorite relegated to \"never again\"."}
{"text":"Went to Lenny's with my hubby (Steeven L.) after reading Matthew B's impeccable review. None of the reviews are kidding when they say that this place is SMALL! I have a 640sq condo and I think my living room is bigger than the dinning area for this place!

As far as ambiance goes, choosing to expand their take out area was probably a good business decision, but it has most likely hindered their dine in experience. Even when we the only ones in the restaurant, it was loud and I felt like I was eating in a soup kitchen. It also seemed like the waiter knew every other dinner by name except us, which sort of made me feel like I was intruding on a private party.

The food itself was phenomenal. Starting with the bread basket being fresh, they used real oregano on everything and their sauces were think and tasty. I disagree with Steeven L. claim that the Primavera pizza was mediocre. I re-heated two left over slices this afternoon and thought it was amazing (I can only imagine how good it tasted fresh).

The Chicken Parmigiana with penne was awesome. The chicken was moist and the penne was cooked just right. I would definitely order takeout from this place... but skip the dinning room."}
{"text":"Wowza!  I'm shocked to see so many positive reviews of this place.  It is an Etobicoke staple, certainly, but the food is lacklustre at best.  

The restaurant is extremely small, so you need a reservation for sure.  Also, the way that the decor works, you are surrounded by ceramic tiles, so the voices of people you are talking to tend to bounce off the walls.  It's disconcerting.  

The staff are also slightly brusque.  

The food - I ordered the Pizza Primavera once and it was incredibly salty.  The kitchen had run out of plum tomatoes (side note: what kind of Italian restaurant runs out of plum tomatoes?!?!  It's like a pho restaurant running out of beef!) and they suggested that it be replaced with anchovies.  Needless to say, I was drinking copious amounts of water that evening.  

One of my companions had ordered veal - it had the look of dryer lint, and was quite tough.  

Good points: good value for money (particularly the lasagna take out deal), pizzas are not bad but watch out for substitutes

Bad points: staff, eating in"}
{"text":"I used to live in Etobicoke 5 years ago. I picked up the family lasagna very often. It used to be the best lasagna I've ever eaten. 
Haven't been to this place since almost 2 years. So yesterday we picked up a family lasagna. I was very disappointed. The lasagna has almost no meat sauce in between the layers. There is also not enough cheese. The lasagna tastes very dry. 
I drove 70 km to get this food but I won't do that again."}
{"text":"Last night I had dinner at Lenny's with my father. He's been a regular for 10 years, and I hadn't been back since I was a kid. They've renovated since I was last there, making the dining room more cozy and reducing the seating area from 40 to 18, in order to accommodate their high volume of take out orders. So if you're going during peak hours, call beforehand.

Upon arrival, there was a freshly made foccacia on the table, with olives, peppers and prosciutto on top, along with two glasses of red wine. Before we even sat down! My dad called in advance to say were were coming, and the server Alex, took it upon himself to have the food waiting for us. Amazing.

Next we each had a Calabrese salad, which consisted of huge hunks of provolone cheese, tomatoes, hot peppers, and onions drizzled in olive oil. Oh yeah, by this time Alex had already refilled out bread basket once, and we were still on the appetizers.

For our mains, I ordered the Chicken Parmigiana with penne, and my father had the Lemon Chicken with fresh veggies. We also ordered a side of rapini, like the good Italians we are - Nonno always said that nothing aids in digestion like rapini.

The meals were phenomenal, I was regretting mowing through  close to 3 baskets of bread by the time the mains arrived, and next time I will be more spartan with my table bread intake (even though it's freshly made and so damn good!).

For me the dead give away of good Italian food is the tomato sauce, a holy staple of most any Italian meal, and at Lenny's, the sauce was to die for (part of the reason I went through so much bread). The chicken breasts were large, succulent and tender, the rapini was blanched, then pan fried with garlic in a way that made me think it had somehow been bbq'd and was phenomenal.

All in all, I can't wait to go back next time I'm in Etobicoke, and if you are in the area, at the very least call for some take out, you won't regret it."}
