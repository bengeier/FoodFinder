{"text":"This owner has been linked to another pizza place locally and built it from the ground up.  When I first tasted and met the owner that night I knew he was making a winner.  Quaint little to go spot with lots of flavor that couldn't be contained by any amount of space.  Pizza is the go to option, the wings are good appetizer before you get to the real treat.  Get the Hawaiian pizza you won't regret it.  If that's not your preferred slice, get a classic cheese or pepperoni you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came in today at lunch time. 1 other table. The service was nice, if not a bit confusing for dining in. Wasn't sure to order at table or counter. Anyway, had a bacon cheeseburger. Burger was past well done. I will say, seasoned well for it being overcooked. Toppings were fresh. Fries (obviously frozen) were well seasoned. Table behind us pizza looked awesome. Work on the burgers please!!!"}
{"text":"OK, its obvious friends and family are leaving reviews for this place!
First tip-off was the abysmal health score of 95 (including 2 certificates for employee training). while the place is \"clean\" in the dining area, I can only imagine what the back looks like. The infractions on the Union County Inspections website should be viewed BEFORE your first visit here. I made the mistake of perusing their current and past inspection while waiting for the \"food\". Speaking of which, an 8\" baguette half filled with meat is not a philly cheese steak. I broke off the ends about 1.5-2\" and still ended up with a mouth full of bread on my first bite. All the diners seemed to be really friendly with the staff with a lot of chatting in a familiar way. this leads me to think they will not be here long relying on family to make them look good. The pizza I observed on one of the tables looked no better than store bought frozen. $24.00 for what amounted too 2 hot dog buns with a little meat and bruised fries is a joke of the highest caliber. Needless to say, ill let the family members who appear to frequent this place continue to be their loyal fan-base.
The wife wants me to add that the bread she found stale and fillings uninspiring."}
{"text":"Very good wings! Very good environment! Very friendly service! Will definitely come back and support this local business! If you're looking for wings, this is the place. French fries and chicken tenders were also very good. Can't wait to try the pizza and burgers next time!"}
{"text":"I am from New York and it is hard to find good pizza around here. We tried it last night and was very impressed. We also ordered the wings. My family loved it all. Would definitely have it again.  An additional plus is their drive up window.  Never even left my car!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time, place is nothing fancy, but the food made up for it, I ordered wings and a specialty Pizza, all I can say that I was pleasantly surprised, very reasonably priced  and the food was delicious. I will definitely go back again. this is my new Wings and Pizza joint!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good wings place. We are new to the area.  We think we found it! Ordered medium garlic wings and he made them custom to our order and they were great. Also enjoyed the zucchini sticks."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and the wings are pretty good too. Haven't tried anything else, but totally would. My go-to pizza place, for sure. I'm drooling."}
{"text":"We have passed over this place for quite some time because of its location in the back corner of the plaza - you have to drive by about 8 other restaurants to get to it - but finally, we did.
WOW - I haven't seen this type of a variety in ages. It has everything from burgers with a donut bun to fish and chips to open faced turkey sandwiches to...ok, you get the point. YES. They have the usual pub fare but also a lot more and a TON of options for customizing. Their salads are great, too and you can build darn near anything, with all the salad fixings being just the one price. What an idea, right?!
The mushroom Swiss burger my son got was laughably large. He got 2 meals out of it as did my husband with his burger. The fries are seasoned and unusual but quite good. They reheat well, too! I had the aforementioned fish and chips and they were definitely worth ordering again - super hot, 3 crispy filets that I ate the next day, too - atop a mountain of fries. Yes, they have a bunch of other sides but we're the kind of people that judge a place by its fries. If you can't do a fry right then why bother ordering anything else? 
Large, clean comfy place and very friendly. You could bring a group here and they'd all find something to entice them. The bar looked well-supplied and tended by a good-looking jovial kind of guy - the perfect bartender! :)
Prices were standard: the 3 of us had full lunches and drinks - which they also gave a brand new to-go drink for me! - which ran us around $35. We got a complete lunch the next day from all the leftovers. We aren't huge eaters (no lumberjacks here) but I would say you could not possibly have a meal here and walk away anything less than stuffed, happy and feeling like you've found a new go-to spot. We did."}
{"text":"This is a takeout joint, no frills, not really a place conducive to dine in. There are two tables, but very bare bones.

Wings are decent, better than average.  Pizza was average.  Not bad, but nothing to rave about.

Prices are reasonable.

Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"We've been several times and the food is delicious ! Staff is Great! 
Burgers like my mom made by hand! 
Pizza with the Taste of Italy! 
Chicken Tenders that are Thick and soft and juicy inside and crunchy outside! 
Fries are perfect not too light and not too brown! 
Pita Burgers are awesome! 
Great wings! Not tiny like some restaurants! 
I'm getting Hungry Writing this ! Nom nom nom nom! 
I will definitely be going back!  Try the Aloha Pizza!"}
{"text":"First time there. Ordered pizza & it was very good. Fast & friendly service. Prices are reasonable so I'm sure we will go again."}
{"text":"DO NOT BE FOOLED!!!!!!

This is the first time I feel like I was scammed on Yelp! 

I totally agree with the other review I just read (after it was too late) that family members must be writing the great reviews! Come on!!!! One guy actually mentioned the pizza was a 'taste of Italy'!!! Unbelievable! $48 for a pepperoni pizza made with ready-made frozen dough, 10 wings, small salad, and mozzarella sticks. Not at all worth it! 

Don't get me wrong it was not terrible food but the quality absolutely did not correlate to the price. Expectations should be set that this is a two star establishment at best and not a $ price. 

Positive: Agreed that the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place. I won't but a Philly cheese steak from anywhere else. Learned all of the wing sauces are homemade with locally source honey as well. Very cool place and cool people!"}
{"text":"I saw this little spot out on my way home from the Grand Asia Market (they are in the same shopping center). Based on Yelp reviews I thought I would try them out.  It seems to only be a takeout type spot although there was a couple eating at the small table they had in there.  I ordered pizza and wings.  Both were really good! :) Only thing I wasn't crazy about was the pizza had jarred or canned mushrooms instead of fresh.  Wings were great, I ordered the regular hot and the hot bbq.  The hot bbq was my favorite.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Such great pizza, especially the crust. The wings are meaty and cooked just right, and the blue cheese is really high quality. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great wings and service. The BBQ has a nice sweetness that isn't overpowering and the mild has just enough heat to be interesting. Drop in and visit these guys!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings. Both were fresh and tasty. Portions are big and prices are reasonable. Can't wait to come back. Never ordering from one of those chains again."}
{"text":"If you want a simple, quick burger with fries and friendly service, this is the place.  They even offered free ice cream when we left!  Will certainly come back, customer service is excellent and the food is cooked to order."}
{"text":"I will admit I was a little apprehensive about going to eat here after some reviews I read on Yelp. Not only the negative reviews but also the replies of the owner. 
The food was alright. I had wings & the zucchini fries. The wings needed more sauce, they were a bit dry. I wouldn't recommend the zucchini fries. There was a ton of breading and very little zucchini. They were also burnt. 
I will try this place again if I'm in a pinch for dinner. Maybe their pizza will be good. 
The owner's dad was there and was very friendly and welcoming. He was the nicest person there."}
{"text":"Best wings in North Carolina.  Made perfectly.  I usually do not like to eat wings but Dunwright Grill makes them the best I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"Have only done delivery and the food was still hot and super yummy!! Great wings, mozzarella sticks, zucchini sticks and the list of Panther watching treats continues. Service has always been excellent. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We stopped in after seeing some solid reviews, and looking for something a little out of the ordinary loop of restaurants we get into the habit of visiting. At first glance, if you were to throw a few pictures of (insert fast food here) on the wall, it could be just about any cuisine - most notably Chinese would seem likely. Put another way: This is not your typical pizza place. While friendly enough, it's just missing something that makes it feel a little homey. In fact, if you go down a couple businesses, to Enzo's Market, you will see what I mean - a completely different feel when you walk through the door.

Beyond the atmosphere, once the food is delivered, the feel continues, because the food you get is almost entirely what you would get if you pull something out of the freezer. It's not that it's bad,because I've been one to eat frozen pizza on more than one occasion, but if you're headed out to eat, you expect something different.

I can't speak to other food, like burgers and wings, but when it comes to the Italian side of the menu, there is definitely something lacking. For some reason my picture isn't showing up on my review, but if you look, you can see - the mushrooms and peppers are certainly not fresh, and the other veggies are likely not either (though they are less easily identified as such)."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick, good lunch and that's what we got. Super friendly staff, very limited menu. Only a few tables, but it is clean (restroom was very clean). Order at the counter, serve your own drinks and they bring the food to your table. We both had cheeseburger and fries and they were good. Fries were fresh and hot. Want to go back and try the wings. If you are looking for an extensive menu or anything beyond super casual, go someplace else. For what it is, it is pretty good."}
{"text":"Enjoyed pizza and the Panthers game tonight! Pizza was hot and delicious! Support this locally owned business!"}
{"text":"Dunwright has the best wings south of Buffalo! Great food, friendly people, a great neighborhood Resturant!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and great food.  So far i have had the pizza and wings both were very good.  The pizza is as close to NY as you can get around here and the price is excellent.  This place has got me through the Stanley cup play offs so far and i thank you for that!!"}
{"text":"I don't really want to give a bad review, but here's the latest problem.  I printed a restaurant.com certificate & the website said Dunwright had an additional requirement which I met.  Then I show up there & they said I couldn't use the certificate if I was getting wings.  So they added another requirement.

I was there for wings, not pizza.  So we left & they lost a bit of business that day & the future since I don't like two different rules put on me just to get an order of wings.   Very bad move on their part."}
{"text":"Excellent wings with very generous amounts of sauce in great flavors. I do wish you could do orders of 6 instead of 10. Love the honey sriracha and garlic parm. A good place for takeout."}
{"text":"This is a great example of a local family run business that should be supported. The pizza was fantastic and it is always good to have a little Cheerwine while in NC. The salad my wife got was basically iceberg with pizza toppings on top, but the pizza and subs looked great."}
