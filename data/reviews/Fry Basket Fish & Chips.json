{"text":"I have been to this place multiple times with my girlfriend and each time the fish has been perfect and the fries are great! The prices are reasonable, especially because of the sheer amount of food you get. $20 for the halibut and chips, but it's definitely worth it! 

Place looks old fashioned, but you're not coming here for that! The service is fantastic as they are always friendly and attentive. Best fish and chips I've had in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place

If you are looking for a fancy breakfast / lunch spot, go else where. The Fry Basket is a wonderfully cozy restaurant that serves up nice hearty meals. The portions you receive for the price you pay is unbelievable. I have never had a larger breakfast anywhere. 

My plate was heaped with 5 sausages, 3 eggs, 2 pieces of toast and a generous pile of home fries, and all for under $10 (before tip). The coffee is also quite nice, its a little thing but it makes a big difference with a breakfast. I have been many times and sampled a variety of menu items and have yet to be dissapointed.

The service is always fantastic as well. smiles-a-plenty accompanied by swift and efficient service. The coffee cups are pretty small but I have yet to see the bottom of one.

If you want a nice relaxed little place to grab a bite to eat with friends that won't break the bank look no further"}

The Fry Basket is a staple right on the Thornhill/North York border that serves up fatty, meaty, gigantic breakfasts and home burgers at good prices. If Norm and Cliff left Cheers at 6am in the morning, this is where they would head for an omelette.

People come here to forget their diets. The bacon and 3 eggs special ($7) comes with about 43 strips of bacon and a few pounds of tasty home fries. They are usually very good about service, and refill your coffee dutifully as you stuff your mouth with cholesterol. There's nothing healthy in here, but the value is great if you're looking for a filling meal at a good price. Regulars love the fish and burgers, but I would opt for the breakfast just to see the bacon.

They don't make them like this anymore.

{"text":"Food : Breakfast portions are very generous (see pictures). Our order of overeasy eggs were cooked just right. Three pieces of slightly overcooked but tasty peameal bacon are served. Home fries are slightly undercooked while the french fries is cooked just right! There are refills for tea and coffee and two toasted buttered breads are standard.  

Ambiance: There is a charming family business feel to this place. Fish decorations on the walls and diner style desks and chairs.On late Monday morning, the place had about 10 guests which seemed like regulars. 

Price: Breakfasts are very well priced,  approx $8 buys you (1-3) eggs, 3 pieces of peameal bacon, fries, 2 full pieces of buttered toast, refillable cofee/tea. 
What I really enjoyed about this place is their philosophy of NOT nickle and diming the customer: no extra cost for additional eggs (1, 2 , 3 eggs all the same price); one free refill of  your coffee or tea; and the huge portions of meat and bread compared to other breakfast places.

Service: The lady serving us was very kind, respectful, and attentive. Food arrived quickly and she refilled our tea and coffee without us having to ask."}
{"text":"I like the Fry Basket.  It is a greasy spoon, but it does the greasy spoon thing well.

The waitresses are very friendly.  The food portions are really big.  Decor is definitely old school, but I can dig it. 

The fish and chips is a bit expensive but they do give you a big porition.   I'd recommend the omelettes as they are pretty huge and tasty. 

There is some free parking behind the building and you can also enter from behind."}
{"text":"I think they should rename it Chips and Fish because that is basically what you get for your $15... a large halibut fish cut paper thin and covered in crumbly batter  and about 3 servings of fries... just ok fries .  Ended up throwing most of it away.   Last time I was there I asked why the halibut price was so high... just had not seen it anywhere I have gone.  She barked that the price has gone up everyday for months... Just too expensive for such a mediocre piece of fish.  For 15 bucks I expect at least a decent size of fish... If you check out the price for just one fish without the fries  it is just 60 cents less .   This is not a 12 dollar piece of fish by no means. 
The other poster must be a poser because no one would call this place cozy and the food good.   Two women walked in while I was waiting and took one look at the place and left.  If you like bad fried food this is the place for  you !!!!   
 I would give it a zero if I could."}
{"text":"tremendous fish and chips, the burgers aint so bad either"}
{"text":"Been coming here for breakfast the last couple years. Food is good and portions are large! I've had breakfast food, sandwiches, fish & chips, and have all been great. The batter they use for the fish and chips are different than a lot of other restaurants and is a good option if you're feeling fish and chips."}
{"text":"Nice joint to come for breakfast - your typical greasy diner food, perfect for a hungover morning. I had the french toast, and it was pretty good. Definitely satisfactory.

The staff here were so pleasant! Honestly, so friendly and lovely. I would come back just for them."}
{"text":"Came here for Easter Sunday lunch/breakfast as it's one of the only fish & chip places open. The place has an old school diner feel but everything was clean. There's also parking in the back which is very convenient. We ordered their special of chicken fingers, halibut fingers and fries for 20.99 for two people to share. After we ordered, the cole slaw came which was nice and refreshing although slightly on the sour side. When the main came, it was a very generous portion of food with lots and lots of fries. The halibut fingers were really yummy! The batter is light and thin, with lots of fish inside! Fries were very good as well, thick cut and mushy on the inside, I especially enjoyed the more crispy thin bits. Chicken fingers were adequate but nothing special. We would come back and order the halibut and chips! (the fish & chips is on the expensive side at 18.99 per order)"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular at The Midway and was disappointed when it got sold and turned into a Gaby's Pub. I went looking around to other restaurants like Kotsy's and Steve's, but The Fry Basket is tough to beat. It's a great greasy spoon, and has become my new Sunday morning go to.

The food is great, the cooks have no problem making something specifically the way you want it. The portions are pretty big considering the prices are cheap. And it's one of the only places I know that isn't stingy on the bacon. A regular meal will get you 5-6 pieces, a side order will nearly double that! A problem with their bacon is that it's too salty. I've asked them to hold back on the salt, but it doesn't help much. The fish and chips is humongous, it's their specialty, but I don't see it ordered as often as the breakfast.

The wait staff are great here, and after a few visits you'll quickly get to know everyone. They're always walking around and quick to refill your coffee when you need it. 

The only problem is how small the restaurant is. It makes for some great atmosphere, but on the weekends it can be pretty packed. It's not uncommon for my father and I to wait 5-10 minutes for a table. The staff are very quick, but people like to sit and talk for a bit after they're done. The open hours are also kind of weird, not open past the afternoon, however they're open on holidays and most times everywhere else closed down. They're reliable. 

Parking is pretty easy, front parking gets competitive in Yonge st. But there's usually a spot if you don't mind walking and extra minute and there's parking in the back (with an old midway sign that brings back memories) but it's tight in there, so be careful."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant.  I have been wanting to try it for a while.  I went in late afternoon.  I was the only one there.  The restaurant was very clean.  The service was excellent.  I did find this restaurant a bit on the pricy side.  I had Halibut and salad.  The portions were huge.  Missed not having lemon with my fish.  The fish was very good.  The dressing for the salad had too much vinegar in it.  The glass for my can of iced tea was small.  My server appreciated my business."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp for their highly rated fish & chips. A small mom and pop place. Unfortunately, they ran out of fish (2:45pm on a Sunday). I decided to try their breakfast. 3 eggs, choice of meat (5 sausages/bacon/ham), choice of toast and choice of home fries or chips (French fries) or slice tomatoes. Great price. All for $7.79, if I remember correctly. I got the chips because I wanted to know what they would be like with their fish & chips. Excellent chips. You can tell they are freshly cut daily. The whole breakfast was very good. Much better than Sunset Grill. Their sausage is bigger and bacon thicker (my wife got the same breakfast with bacon) than most breakfast places I've been to. The waitress who served us was friendly and attentive, always making sure our coffee or tea was topped up. 
I will definitely come back to try the fish & chips or have the breakfast again."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of 24/7 diners in Chicago. 

I usually come here for breakfast. Eggs are prepared fresh. Go for the bacon as their sausages are meh. I would also recommend that you get a side of French fries or tomatoes as their hash browns are meh squared."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with my spouse, and we were not left wanting! The restaurant is quite small, and the tables were more than half full, but the atmosphere was relaxed and quiet. The waitress was prompt, kind, and attentive. We split a 2 piece halibut and chips meal, and the pieces of fish were a bit larger than the average paper back novel - huge portions. The food was prepared within a couple of minutes from ordering, and we were impressed by the prompt service. We couldn't finish all of the fries between the two of us, but we both left very satisfied. 

For the lunch crowd, I would suggest giving this place a try. The service and food prep were so quick that anyone with an hour long lunch break can easily fit this place into their schedule."}
{"text":"This place is cute inside, has that old diner feel. Came here for all day breakfast at 1pm and the place was full of diners.

ordered the breakfast with sausage and egg whites, and a bason and 3 eggs breakfast. the home fries are better than the regular fries. It's a really big breakfast. there was 5 whole sausages (but it was so salty i could only eat 2 of them) the bacon was nice and big pieces also. they did not provide any jam for the toast. They kept coming back to refill the coffee, very nice and friendly service, but a bit too busy for 2 people to handle when the place is full.

I would come back to try the fish and chips, but wont be back for the breakfast."}
{"text":"Halibut and fries are amazing portions. Extremely friendly staff, with great service. When sitting down the restaurant itself is a bit antiquated, only reason for the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Missing London's Fish & Chip shops we have been regulars here and are satisfied! Portions are good and great customer service."}
{"text":"I come to the Fry basket for both breakfast and fish, but not at the same time! 

No Breakfast place that I know serves 6 huge pieces of bacon! A gigantic tasty order of  homefries. 

Just the one piece of Fish n' Chips is enough for me, the size and quality of the halibut they serve is nothing like any other Fish n' Chip restaurant I tried. I always change the fries to homefries.

Service is always friendly and lovely. Warm and cozy atmosphere and awesome food. If you like a really nice, well prepared home cooked meal, you really can't go wrong with any of the choices and prices.

The only downfall to this place is they have crazy hours and are not open late, but other then that, I like it!"}
{"text":"This is my go to fry-up brekkie joint in Thornhill. Classically old place that hasn't seen a revocation in decades. That my friends is a good thing. 

Today I ordered the 3-egg breakfast. I'm trying to make lifestyle changes so ordered it with a side of brown toast (no butter) and tomatoes. I wish I was young again so I could enjoy it like how I used to (eggs, peameal, home fries and gravy). 

The eggs were tasty and fresh. Bright yolks proved that point. In all honestly, the eggs were a tiny bit over cooked, but I'd still call them over medium as ordered. 

Tomatoes were served raw. I garnished them with some pepper. They were fresh and ripe. 

The toast was just the run of the mill bagged bread. Nothing to write home about. 

All in all a good breakfast, however, for this healthy version, I think it's a bit over priced. The standard breakfast comes with meat so when you substitute tomatoes for bacon/sausage, there needs to be a break for the customer. 

Also, a lot of diner such as this will still include home fires when you don't order meat and substitute tomatoes. This place does not do that. 

It would be a nice touch to add a 'light' breakfast at a discounted rate. I know it may not be their bread and butter but economically, it makes sense for both the consumer and operator."}
{"text":"The fish and chips lived up to their reputation. Portions are huge and the fish is flaky with a great batter, not overly greasy and no fishy taste. The fries were a bit overdone, and the tartar sauce came in little packets which was disappointing to more than one person in our party. 
The biggest downsides would be 1) the service and 2) the price.
The waitresses were friendly so I don't mean to say anything against them, but the restaurant was packed and at any time there was only 1-2 people managing all the tables. I do not blame them for not being able to keep up -- the restaurant should staff up during a busy sunday lunch rush.
The prices were great for breakfasts and I think I will return for this! I think it was $7 for an egg breakfast and you get 1 free refill on your coffee. However, the prices for fish and chips were steep. $17 for one piece or $27 for two. Everyone in my party still went for the fish and chips as the waitress said it was the best she ever had and I'd read the reviews on yelp. Most people ended up sharing a plate in pairs of two. The one piece itself was shareable as the portions are large as mentioned earlier, but a friend and I split a two-piece and I'm glad we did because the fish was great and I kept wanting to eat more. It was nice that the restaurant allowed all of us to share plates. However, I won't be frequenting this place for the fish and chips because it's still steep for a lunch, unless you're sharing. I will say that most people at my table said it was the best fish and chips they had ever had so the waitress was right!

Side note: parking isn't great, but try and nab a spot in the parking lot out back that can be accessed via Woodward."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago I was watching Diner's, Drive-Ins and Dives...BIG MISTAKE! This show is a heart attack in the making.

It also gives you cravings...often for food you can't possibly get, because they're making some crazy thing across the country that you cannot possibly find a duplicate for. 

Naturally I got a crazy craving for fish and chips...my mistake being that this was a Sunday and for whatever reason, no fish and chip places are open on Sunday. 

I did a lot of looking around, before I found this place, which wasn't too far away and was, most importantly, open! 

This is a quirky place, with wood panelling on the walls and some random fish hung around the place.

Fry's boasts full day breakfasts and the fish and chips. I saw plenty of people coming for the full day breakfasts, which are decently priced and looked pretty good, if nothing special.

We came for the F&Cs though! 

We ordered the single piece, which was MORE than enough food. Quite expensive though. You're looking at around $15/meal of one large piece of fish and some fries.

It was good, but it wasn't great. Worst of all, the tartar sauce came in sealed packages....ugh.

I'm sorry, but when I'm paying a premium for my fish and chips, at a place named after it's Fish and Chips...I WANT SOME DAMN PROPER TARTAR SAUCE! It's only like the EASIEST thing in the world to make.

Service was fine. No complaints. The waitress did her job...took our order, gave us our food and gave us the bill....that was her job and she did no more and no less.

The restaurant ambiance wasn't there, the food wasn't special and the prices weren't good.

Next time I get a fish and chips craving I'm going to try elsewhere."}
{"text":"Mom n' Pops know how to serve fish right and even though they serve it with tacky tartar sauce, freshly fried and perfectly battered halibut make up for the 'ketchup packaged style' tartar.

Homestyle fries that come with the meal are plenty and filling. Some may find the place a bit pricey but if they fry fish this good, go for their 2 fish meal and share it with someone who share the same appetite, or preferably a much smaller one. 

Haven't tried the breakfast here but judging from other people's plates, this place DOES NOT skimp out on portions.

Parking is sooo bad as it shares a back lot with money mart among other businesses (located behind the old plaza) and prone to drivers clueless on parking etiquette who fail to read designated areas meant for each business. 

But whatever, avoid it on weekends and have some good 'ol fish n chips to boost your mood on a chilly day with a cup of Jo. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Wow! I Just got a order of fries to go and these are hands down the best in the area! Not  too greasy yet very crispy! Loved them and the lady who serves them is a gem :)"}
{"text":"*PRICES HAVE INCREASED* 

Came here one Sunday to fulfill a fish and chips craving. I have never been but have driven by numerous times and was always curious.

Dated diner feel inside, with wood paneling on the walls and a bit dank and dim. Don't expect anything fancy. Not too big but we were able to get one of the last two empty tables around noon on a Sunday without a wait.

Reasons for only two stars:

1) Price - ridiculous. One piece fish and chips is $19. Two pieces is $35! This is insane for a diner meal. Yes, the portion is quite big (mainly fries tho, the piece of fish is large, but not large enough to warrant the price). I wish they would slim down on the hefty fry portion and then slim down the price with it. Although it was good (good. not great) (also - fries were overcooked and not hot) and gave me my fix was definitely NOT worth $19. 

2) Tartar Sauce - if you advertise as a fish and chips joint and charge insane prices for said fish and chips, at least serve some proper tartar sauce. Doesn't need to be 'house-made' but get a pre-made tub of good stuff like other restos do. Instead they serve those nasty solo packets that you would get in a food court setting which imo is the nastiest tartar sauce out there. But for real - if you are charging me $19 for one piece of fish and chips, you better compliment it with proper tartar sauce...

3) DON'T SIT NEAR THE BACK!!! - we learned this the hard way. Aside from it being very cold in the back, it is also right beside the back door, which is also the door to the washroom. And every. single. bloody. time. someone exits or enters you have a nice huge whiff of OUTHOUSE stank. Smells like musty sewer and the smell is overwhelming. How can I enjoy my overpriced $19 fish and chips with crappy tartar sauce while smelling and almost tasting TOILET& SEWAGE. Believe me. it's tough.

4) Service - tbh it wasn't terrible and they were friendly enough considering it IS a diner. But it lacked in a lot of ways. When we entered, instead of smiling at us or guiding us to a table or simply telling us to 'take a seat anywhere' the waitress who was holding a broom and sweeping just looked at us annoyed and asked us to move, as she wanted to sweep where we were standing. Not sure what to do we sat ourselves at one of the two last remaining empty tables which was covered in droplets of milk. We then waited 15+ minutes to even get a menu. We encountered the same wait time when trying to get a container for the leftovers and the bill. Yes, it is a diner. But if your 1 piece fish and chips served with fake tartar sauce and a side of bathroom is $19, I think you can up your service just a tad.

Overall, food is decent, prices are crazy, and seeing that we live in a city filled with great food choices, I would pass on this place."}
{"text":"The place is a dive, but mostly clean and the breakfast is a good deal.  The price of their fish has kept me in a no buy mood for years but I do remember is being quite tasty.  I think they should bring their sky-high fish prices down to earth and they would garner more business and more stars from me."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 portions huge. Fresh fish. They need their own tartar sauce. 

Service: 5/5 looks like family business. Very friendly

Location: 4/5 major intersection. Small but free parking on the back.

Price: 3/5 $25 for 2 pieces of fish and fries. But the huge and tasty."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Fry Basket with my kids for 14 years.  Without a doubt...best bacon & egg combo in THORNHILL. Service is great, refills on the coffee and good home made food!  Gotta try the burgers or fish and chips.  Equally as tasty with the BLT or chicken fingers and fries a close second.  Love this place...cozy and casual atmosphere that delivers great food and a great value for the dollar!"}
{"text":"Great service and although I initially thought price for halibut and chips was expensive, not when you see the portion.  I defentltly recommend these fish and chips!!!   Light batter and cooked perfectly.  One portion can feed two people."}
{"text":"This place has been opened for a long time!  Longer than the number of people who needed open heart surgery, gastric bypass, Jenny Craig...Don't get me wrong, this isn't my first time here and probably not my last time either.  This place is the place you go when you want to run through the culinary gambit with reckless abandonment and no care for the future.  Or...you just want to get some great tasting Fish and Chips or Breakie!

They have awesome F&C.  They also do a great all day breakie, hamburgers, and other \"foods.\"  Generous portions is an understatement here.  However, you will be out CA$H!  Halibut and Chips runs you about $20 before tax and tips.  Yikes!  Also, whether you order breakie with 1, 2, or three eggs...same price.

I usually get one order of fish and chips as we can share.  Today, there was 5 of us, and we ordered double fish with chips and a 3 egg Breakie.  That was it.  More than enough food.  The guy behind us had an order of F&C and a hamburger platter!  Wow insanity!

Enjoy responsibly....

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something else for breakfast.. away from the Wimpy's, Cora's and Daybreak.  Had an early morning breakfast business meeting and decided to try out the Fry Basket Fish and Chips.  When driving by I was immediately disappointed that it was directly against the street and there was no visible parking, so I turned right at the first street hoping to find somewhere to park and realized there was a massive parking lot in the rear available.  Once parked, I also realized that there was a big Open sign on the door at the back with a sign for the Fry basket.  Sweet!  VIP entrance!  And I didn't have to walk around.   Upon entry... this is definitely like an old style 80's greasy spoon.  Spacious, old, pictures of fish, and fish lures all over the wall. Waitress was super friendly, portions were HUGE with good quality.  When I'm in this area, I'll definitely head over to the fish fry.... Good parking for the area, Good value for good breakfast food, friendly service... and that's what going on for breakfast should be really about.  
Recommended.  I'd go back for sure."}
