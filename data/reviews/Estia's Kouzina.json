{"text":"This place had opened up 2 weeks before we tried it. We were looking for something different. We tried the htipiti which had a bit of a kick, nothing to be scared about though, it was subtle. It was delicious, especially with the the feta in it!  We also tried the crabcake's. They were small but good, definitely not full of breading!  Oh and they did have bread served before appetizers which has become rare. It was nice and warm!  I had the lamb chops that were tender and delicious. They came with great potatoes!  Hubby had the grilled bronzini with the rainbow chard. It was really good, and even better with some lemon!  Turns out that there was a Cavs game on so we decided to move to the sofas and have dessert there. We tried the donuts and the spiced walnut cakecake. The donuts weren't very sweet but I loved them, especially with the nuts and as cold leftovers the next day. The spiced walnut cake was absolutely delicious!!! We had some tea also and they had a nice variety.  One of the owner's family came out to speak to us and everyone, including our server was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"If you want Greek, it is more Mediterranean. Service was nice but the food was not what we were looking for. A Gyro made with pork, no thank you. Fries were Luke warm, rotisserie chicken tough, green beans Luke warm. Good luck."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this for the first time today.  Nice looking restaurant.  Service was ok.  The gyro plate was a chopped pork .  Greasy pork.  Not good.  I had the ribs which were good.  I would give them another chance. Flaming cheese appetizer was incredible . I don't know how to spell saganaki."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant on our way home from the Charlotte airport. Escaping from a heavy rain, we went for any port in a storm. To our delight, we discovered a new Greek restaurant with delicious food, lovely decor, and great service. My favorite: Spanokopita (sp?), a spinach pie on phyllo. We liked it so well that we've been back twice."}
{"text":"Went for Brunch fathers day morning and spent almost 100 bucks for cold food; so disappointing for this to be a new restaurant. Greek inspired restaurant but starting with the shrimp and grits it wasn't good. The shrimp was over cooked and the grits was under cooked. The beef that was served at the carving station was cold and on the rare side. The eggs, sausage, quiche, was cold; everything was cold. The chef that was serving at the carving station kept suggesting the pork loin on the buffet table not sure why. Beautiful location and great drinks but I would never go back. A lot of adjustments needs to be made to the brunch menu."}
{"text":"This is the best Greek/Mediterranean cuisine you will find in the Charlotte area. The food is great and the lamb chops is out of this world. They also have a very nice patio for a good sunny day, and a brunch buffet on Sundays."}
{"text":"Just blew back into town and found this place. I'll have to try more to give a solid review, but first impressions are really nice. It is a little pricy I'm comparison, though it is well worth it. Beer and wine list is nice, and everyone was friendly. For now, a five star from me, but I'll update more as I try it.  Edit: I've tried some more of the food, and I'm honestly pretty impressed. I expect this sort of dining in Charlotte, but the quality here is superb. If you like Greek food, this is a must try, and if you've never had it then come try it! My only issue is the price on some dishes since I know how much they would cost to make. It's not extortion, but I would love to see slightly lower prices."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here the other day. I order the pork souvlaki. Flavor was outstanding! Meat was cooked perfectly. Decor is excellent and really like the bottles of water left on table for anytime pour. Service was excellent! Treat yourself to this gem"}
{"text":"The positive- Wonderful atmosphere, beautiful interior, good service  The negative - the food was not good and is very overpriced. My wife had a lamb chop which she thought was good but came with 2 sides which were both bitter. I had a pork chop which was flavorless. I was also asked how I want my pork chop cooked which should not be a choice. I advised well done but it came out medium rare. I agree with my wife that the sides taste different/off, bitter and overly lemony for potatoes.   If I'm going to spend $60-$70 for 2 people, I would rather go to Webb's Custom Kitchen."}
{"text":"So wonderful to have a new restaurant in Gaston County that isn't a chain. We dined there for the first time about a month after they opened. It's a modern, airy restaurant much bigger than it looks from the outside. Good selection of food on the menu without being overwhelming. We had the head-on garlic shrimp appetizer. Very tasty. I decided to try the Bolognese, knowing it would have Greek influence, and I really enjoyed it. Hubby had the whole striped sea bass, grilled on coals. Our waiter performed the surgery to remove the bones, leaving only a few behind. The fish was terrific, mild but delicious with an excellent olive oil and lemon drizzle. Service was great and we look forward to exploring more of the menu on future visits."}
