{"text":"I was \"underwhelmed\" with this joint, the \"front of the house\" has no appeal at all, just t.v's and tables no art work, no posted Menu on the walls. When you walk up to order there's about 6 or so covered warmers so your left wondering \"what's underneath\" , I initially ordered a 2 piece combo which came with 1 rib and a boneless skinless chicken breast which was 2 bucks extra? I went ahead and ordered a 3 piece combo which added 1 additional  rib, with all the combinations you get 2 sides ONLY, my sides were greens and believe it Or not 1 piece of Cornbread is considered a side, Every rib joint in this nation offers Cornbread on the house unless you order extra !! I enjoyed the food better when they were in the Parking lot near downtown. I felt the food was Overpriced for what I ordered, I usually never write reviews but I really hope this place gets Better!! By the way wtf is  Sweet Potato Mash?? Instead of traditional Yams?????? Below is what $14 gets you"}
{"text":"Well I saw signs for BBQ, was originally headed for Chinese food, and decided to check it out. No signs inside, typical printed menu with over half the items not available, and the items that were there didn't look as hoped. Still I got a hot link and chicken-i think? Greens, potato salad and green beans and had to stare down/ask the guy just for some sauce, when you're handing out meat on the dryer side I think you should slap it on there! Food, service and appeal of the place gets a 3. The sauce isn't bad and it's hard to mess up a hot link that's not made by you..... Chicken was overcooked, greens EXTREMELY SALTY while the string beans were FLAVORLESS! Maybe half the salt on the greens and the other half in green beans. And I should've known better than to get potato salad that is made with mayo and not miracle whip..... I'm just saying Smith's is right next door for a reason."}
{"text":"I just have to say my wife and I went to this place for the first time and were amazed at the flavor of the ribs and the tenderness of the meat it was so good , and full of flavor, I couldn't believe it!! Then we had BBQ beans,some collared greens, and macaroni and cheese and everything was fantastic ,and that was toward the end of the night as they were running out of food ... so I highly recommend this place as their food and quality is fantastic ... Better than most rib places I've had.."}
{"text":"I have heard so much hype about this place that I had to go in today and try it out when I got there, there were two young ladies and a Gentleman and the owner up  front which they were very nice and somewhat helpful the girls was awesome though I ordered a two-piece combo meal which came with two different Meats I was never informed that it would be a $3 up charge for the beef brisket but I went ahead and pay for it anyway I literally waited 50 minutes just to get 3 slices of brisket and a boneless chicken thigh with mac and cheese and potato salad ,I also ordered a side of cornbread because it didn't come with my order which after me waiting 50 minutes and I start complaining they told me it will be another 15 more  minutes because the cornbread wasn't ready, once I got home with my food I look at it it look like something you will feed your dog the beef brisket and chicken thigh was so dry I had to drown it with my own barbecue sauce at home the potato salad and mac and cheese was very very disappointing and blend I also ordered a 10 wing combo with fries so once I open that up to look at it and taste it it was full of grease for $29 this is not what I was expecting that was my first time and it would be my last unfortunately I gave it to Star because I had to give more than one stars for the young ladies that was working there because they was so awesome"}
{"text":"Amazing bbq and had a pleasant talk with the owner. I def. recommend to anyone who loves some good ribs and their sausage. Honestly everything they have is amazing. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich and collard greens were absolutely delicious. The bun came perfectly toasted. Everyone I came in with finished all their food and we are all looking forward to coming back and trying more stuff! Staff was incredibly friendly and had excellent customer service. They made us feel so welcome.  Highly recommend giving them a try. What an excellent small business to support!!"}
{"text":"The food is dry. Bring your own sauce to cover how terrible the food is. **************************************** Edit: Business replied and asked why I didn't ask for more sauce since it was so dry? This shows how much they know about meat. Sauce is meant to compliment the meat and not disguise the dryness of the meat."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after reading some of the reviews but I wish I hadn't bothered.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was pretty bland. The gal was chintzy with the sauce, but it still wasn't fabulous after adding more.   Hubby got the ribs, they were dry and tough, and also needed more sauce.  Best thing we had were the greens, the macaroni salad and potato salad were both tasteless.  I seriously doubt if we'll return, and I don't expect them to be around long unless the food drastically improves. Sad, because I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"I truly think they've given up. I ordered a three piece combo and they gave me the thigh in two pieces and one rid. It truly is touch and go here. It's a hit and a miss."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for lunch today and we were very pleased with our meals. I got the brisket sandwich and my husband had the BBQ chicken sandwich. Everything was on point. The Mac N Cheese was slappin and the service was above and beyond. We will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"If you like good cheese burgers  like me then you gotta try the 1/2 pound burger they make nice and juicy seasoned just right with that char broil flavor...it's a shame they are moving from Charleston & Maryland pky to Craig rd... I guess I will be making that trip when I want a great burger!!!                                            #Burgerman..."}
{"text":"Damn Good BBQ, even the leftovers were incredible!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ. I will be back once they get their brisket on the menu. Owner is very friendly. I had a piece combo meal, ribs and hot links. The owner asked me if I wanted the sauce on the meat or on the side.The Ribs were fall off the bone delious, The hot links were not super hot , just like I like them."}
{"text":"My first time I was a little skeptical about the food but after having the mac and cheese, potato salad my chicken breast wasn't bad and I have to be in North Las Vegas on Wednesdays my new spot.  This is my second time at this spot. I had to come back to have my potato salad, mac and cheese,  oh ya my chicken breast was great. I drove home to southwest  Las Vegas. It is Wednesday, I can't wait to get home..."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The customer service is what sets it apart. Anthony and Danny really treated me and my family with the best respect. They gave the best suggestions on food. Further more the food. Ooh the ribs look like heaven. Come see it. Thanks Danny and Anthony!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try TIG after seeing friends on FB go there for months! It was great! We got 2 of the 2 meat plates, ribs and hot links, they were both great. Mac and cheese was perfect. Get down to this food truck before it's gone-they are opening a shop up on Craig in a few months!"}
{"text":"Best barbeque I've had in Las Vegas. Amazing service and a great atmosphere! Experienced cooks and  it's all based off family recipes, can't get better than that!"}
{"text":"The BBQ chicken breast was off the hook delicious. Ribs were ok, not falling off the bone, quite the contrary. The brisket wasn't cut cross grain which made it tough and stringy. I realize meats are cut in the back to be served up front and cross cut brisket falls apart which would be a problem. As customers pay a premium for the brisket, cut it to order but cut it correctly, it makes a big difference. The flavors are amazing, just a few minor things to fix. The staff were friendly and attentive. We'll be back if not just to have more of that chicken breast - WOW!"}
{"text":"Legit BBQ. Cool staff and friendly chefs. Try the peach cobbler! Best in North Las Vegas so far."}
{"text":"Glad to have a new BBQ restaurant in the area. The food is delicious, fresh and the customer service is exceptional those boys are very motivated and nice people all around. I've tried A lot of there food and I've never been disappointed. The onion rings are a MUST TRY."}
{"text":"I've only had TIG - BBQ  twice. But I'm happy to say that my food was great both times.  I love that it's fresh to order and the service is great.  They have the best soul food thus far in Las Vegas.  KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK TIG-BBQ!!!!!"}
{"text":"TIG or Till It's Gone is an awesome new BBQ spot that I had the pleasure of visiting recently. The food here is simply phenomenal!! First off the ribs are delicious... moist & succulent. The meat is fall off the bone good. The meat has a wonderful smoky flavor that is absolutely perfect! The hot link is wonderful. After you snap into it...this nice spicy flavor kicks in just right. The pulled pork is a must with every order, it had an amazing & incredible flavor. The BBQ sauce is right on point as well. The sides were magnificent too!!! I went with mac n cheese & greens. They DID NOT disappoint. Some BBQ spots sometimes feature a just ok mac n cheese, but the TIG mac n cheese is legit!! Certified & bonafide...legit. Same goes for the collard greens. The customer service was great and the staff was very friendly. Parking is good and the prices are excellent. I can't wait to go back to TIG!!!! Thanks to Anthony & Daniel and staff for treating me like family. TIG has stepped into the ring and now has to be considered as one of the best BBQ joints in Vegas!! Bruiser Approved!!!!       @bruiser_eats_vegas"}
{"text":"I for the first time went to TIG BBQ on W. Craig Rd. The food, the atmosphere, and also all of the staff are definitely a 10. I had the pleasure of also meeting with one of the owner named Anthony. They do catering and you also can order your meal in advance. It will be hot and ready when for you when you pick up. And make it a point to get a couple of corn muffin.....definitely yummy!"}
{"text":"Today was my second visit, always like to go somewhere twice if it's good before I blast them. Can you say yummmmy? Okay the ordering is a little different, 1 meat is just that, and 2 meats are like 1 rib and 1 chicken (breast or boneless skinless thigh) and so forth. They are not pricey so if you want more meat just order it. The sides are on the large side, no skipping. On my 2 visits this is how I rate them what I have eaten so far:  Pork Ribs: smokey flavor, great sauce, over all excellent. Boneless Skinless Chicken Thigh: same as ribs above, except I like skin Mac & Cheese: OMG, so good, both times wished I ordered more of it (I'm funny about people mac and cheese and potato salad, this is delicious). Greens: The Bomb! Sweet Potato Mash: Super bomb because I love sweets, it's sweet, not super sweet, just sweet! Peach Cobbler: Super, duber bomb!! Don't leave without it, it seems pricey but it's not considering the large portion they give you.  I'm new to this area, tried 2 other larger bbq places, this one beats them both. I will be back soon!   P.S. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Till it's gone BBQ IS GOOD! Also, the customer service was great! Very friendly. I had the ribs and had that neck yard taste."}
{"text":"This place is fire! We just ate there for the first time and I'm still picking my teeth! The staff was extremely friendly and engaging. They took the time to answer my questions and provided me and my family with some awesome eats! It's hard to find good quality bbq and a affordable price, I found the spot here with tigbbq. We will def be going back and I look forward to another rib or 10! Mac and cheese is so flavorful and the beans have a really nice smoke flavor too!"}
{"text":"The food was good and you get a lot of food for a very reasonable price.  Service was over the top as the staff was super friendly and inviting"}
{"text":"I ordered the 2 piece combo with ribs and brisket with sides of collard greens and sweet potato mash. I got one rib and 5 slices of brisket. The rib had a nice flavored rub, however, it was not tender and it had way too much fat. The bbq sauce wasn't too bad. As for the brisket, it lacked quality, flavor and tenderness. I took two bites and that was it. Adding the bbq sauce made no difference. The collard greens tasted on point like how southern collard greens should taste. The sweet potato mash was heavenly sweet and delicious. My husband also ordered a two piece combo with pulled pork and brisket. He says the pulled pork was ok and the brisket was not tender and you shouldn't have to cut brisket with a knife. He says the mac and cheese was tasteless and the sweet potato mash was too sweet. Overall, we came for the bbq and it fell short of our expectations. We paid over$30 for both combo adding additional $4 per combo for the brisket. The staff was great and we hope the best for TIG."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe that such delicious food can be gotten from a truck. It's nice to know that they will be opening a restaurant soon near their current location."}
{"text":"Food was so good! Will absolutely be back! Restaurant was clean and comfortable and also had cool mural painted on wall. The staff was so friendly and accommodating and everything was served so fast and fresh. 5"}
{"text":"Came here last week when it was almost closing but everything we got came fresh and sooooooo delicious!! I've never had anything so hot and stays hot through the whole meal! Our food never got cold and the fries were the best fries I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best bbq in the world. They are better then Famous Dave's, and any other bbq spot. The people are nice, the food taste amazing and it feels like home. This by far is where I am coming for my bbq and I live in Henderson! A Must try"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend loved it! We got the ribs and pulled pork with sides of baked beans, fries & mac/cheese. The mac & cheese could've been a little better (more seasoned) but our meal and the customer service overall was great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on our way out of town for a quick lunch.  They have really great prices on their combo plates starting at 8.95 for choice of 2 meats and 2 sides. I had ribs and they were exceptional. My son had ribs and chicken thigh (which was a huge portion) and really loved both.  The rest of the menu looks amazing as well. We look forward to coming back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Good points: friendly reception from staff and received food quickly.  Bad points: food tasted drenched in liquid smoke. Brisket wasn't available. Hot link tasted boiled.  We took a few bites and packed up the food to go so as not to be rude.  Second visit? Not never."}
{"text":"I had lunch here on 12/9/17, so late with my review anyway. I have been wanting to try this place because I see the food truck parked near the ATM that I bank with so I was thrilled to notice that they were going to have a restaurant as well so that being said I was looking forward to my visit... there were a handful of customers and I was greeted by a friendly gentleman... I ordered the 2meat combo but only wanted ribs so I thought I would get 4 but he only gave me two ??? My sides were Mac & Cheese and green beans, Mac & cheese was very cheesy but good, food was kept in metal containers with lids so food wasn't piping hot when I got it, ribs were tasty....Overall not bad and the price was decent, would like to return on a Friday for the fish fry or the wing Wednesday's"}
{"text":"Great service! Owner and staff are very friendly and accommodating. Chicken and pulled pork were  delicious!  Healthy portions. Good variety of sides. Try this restaurant! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So if you order the two meat combo, say chicken and rib... you get ONE rib and one piece of boneless thigh filet,  not a leg , not a breast, not a quarter, you get a boneless thigh filet... and the French fries... no good man.   Its like they went  to Walmart and got  the cheapest chicken thighs pack and the cheapest frozen bag of fries.  Make us go WOW and come back for more, not feel cheated (  ONE rib, ONE bone, really?) not impressed, that's just my two cents...  they just opened up, I wish them good luck."}
{"text":"Decided to come here after seeing some reviews online and it was a great idea!! Not Only was the food absolutely amazing but the staff was incredible! So friendly and courteous I would absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"$8 for 2 meats and a side got a rib and BBQ chicken with BBQ baked beans! Good for the price if your in the area!"}
{"text":"I was recommended to this place by a neighbor and finally got a chance to go over after church on Sunday. I am a barbecue connoisseur from Tennessee and this barbecue was phenomenal. The service was great the staff was friendly the owners were available. I couldn't ask for anything more. Can't wait to they start serving brisket."}
{"text":"The pulled pork was extremely bland and tasted like it came out of a crock pot.  There is not even a scent of smoke anywhere in any of the food.  They charge you for extra sauce, and damn near every store bought brand is just as good if not better. Both my sons ordered a meal off the student section, cheeseburger with fries and wings and fries but yet when I looked at the bill they charged me an extra dollar for fries. Fries were good.  Throw in waiting over 40 minutes to get our food.  Yeah the name makes sense I wonder how long till TIG is gone."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I have been here twice and are absolutely hooked! The staff is amazing, the food is phenomenal and the restaurant area is always clean! I love this place and know that it's worth a drive!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Very good, authentic southern food. Takes like what you make at home, and they're always helpful and friendly! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"First, let me start off by saying...I DO NOT eat/buy collard greens from anywhere besides family, but today I decided to take a leap of faith and added this to my side order. Did not disappoint! The chicken breast is nothing short of juicy. They're consistent with tasty foods and awesome service! Much success!!   One Happy Client."}
{"text":"OMG! LOL The brisket was as tough as the soles of my boots! Horrible! We went in at dinner time, 5pm, and they only had brisket and hot links. They charged us $8 more for the dried out brisket! So two $9.95 2-piece combos came to over $30!! They were out of most of their sides too! NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"I ate there for the first time on Sunday, I was Not impressed. Paid Extra for Brisket, and it was so Tough couldn't even eat it. Also, I thought it was rather highly priced for the little amount of food. I was really disappointed."}
{"text":"A BBQ joint with no BBQ. Apparently this is a common  occurrence with them. Shame I drove out of my way to get here."}
{"text":"Glad this place opened up in the area. We tried it out during their grand opening & definitely coming back. Someone else mentioned some items unavailable but it's called Till it's Gone for a reason. The most famous bbq places in the world serve till they run out for the day. So if you go late expect for them to be low or out of the best stuff! Definitely better than any bbq in the area."}
{"text":"I came from Texas and for 2 years, I have been looking for good BBQ.  This is not just Good, this is Awesome! BEST BBQ i have came across and i don't even feel like i need to look anymore. Thank you for this delicious meal. I will be back. I feel like im at home! Clean restaurant. Great artwork. A+ service!"}
{"text":"The food is super yummy, and the associates are very friendly. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"On Friday I was actually looking for a place to eat and had decided to stop at a Chinese buffet but on the way I happened to notice their sign and decided to try it instead. I am definitely glad I did the food was fantastic I had the two meat special with two sides, the collard  greens  and the mac and cheese were good though I like mine a little more crispy on top.  The co-owner introduced himself and was very friendly Friday is fish fry Friday and though I didn't order fish he happily gave me a sample and a free beverage certainly a excellent way to get customers coming back especially when the food is very good as well. Going back next Friday for the fish it was exceptional."}
{"text":"Well the mood was barbecue ribs.. Friday at 5ish. Arrive, was immediately told out of ribs out of catfish. I could see if we were here around 9ish, but this was still fairly early.  So at this point we figured we are here, let's try something else. Got the student wing meal ( 5 wings, fries ) then I ordered the 2 piece special. Chicken, brisket with a 4.00 upcharge ( while he was like its 4.00 additional is that ok ) I thought that was odd to inquire with me like that,  but I responded of course,  mac and cheese,  and potato salad. I don't drink sodas at all. They don't have bottle water options or anything other than HI-C fruit punch for ppl who don't drink soda. We sat waited for our food. Several ppl came in were told like us out of ribs and they turned around and walked out. I felt bad for the person who rang us up, as there were a few tables that needed to be cleaned even ours, and he had to come out and bus tables too. He was polite. The atmosphere was ok,  the location convenient, with ample parking. Also if you want to leave a tip, bring cash as their credit card reader doesn't have that option."}
{"text":"Soooooo good!!! All the sides were amazing & the meats were full of flavor! Definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Everything I've eaten here I've loved! I'm a big fan of the chicken thighs, greens and potato salad but the Mac n cheese and peach cobbler is legit too. Bring your appetite! Super friendly and accommodating staff, definitely one of my favorite barbecue places in the valley"}
{"text":"The staff and people who work here or very friendly and a pleasure to deal with. I hate to report that the barbecue is subpar. The cornbread was dry and the sauce wasn't very good at all. I hate giving them a bad review because of how friendly and nice they were in the store and that is why they get two stars instead of one"}
{"text":"This is a solid BBQ place.  My wife and I stopped here on the way home from work.  We were craving some good bbq outside of the chain joints and the overpriced casino places, and this was pretty much the perfect atmosphere.  It's got the small \"mom & pop\" feel inside, but newer.  The booths were new and pretty nice, but not built for a hefty guy like myself.  Still it was nice!  The food was pretty freakin' good.  We both had an order of the spare ribs, while I had some brisket and she had some pulled pork.  It was all good; the spare ribs needed no saucy bbq as the marinade and rub was awesome, her pulled pork was delicious too.  THe brisket was a little overcooked, but had all the right flavors.  The bbq had more of the vinegary style going, which I love.  For sides, we had mash sweet potatoes, potato salad, and corn bread muffins.  Both the potatoes were awesome; the mashed sweet potatoes tasted like they had some butter and brown sugar mixed in (but not over done) and the potato salad was perfect done with a little sweet relish running through it.  The only reason I didn't give it five is first, it was our first time dining there, and secondly, they were out of a lot of stuff, and we waited a long time for the muffins.  Again, they were awesome, but we weren't prepared for the wait, which was about 20 minutes AFTER the meal was served.  Definitely would try again though!"}
{"text":"Very good food.. the owner even gave us a free drink and free desert .. recommended to anyone looking for good bbq spot"}
{"text":"Just finished eating lunch here, my second time. Best BBQ in las Vegas!   I am from Texas and this BBQ is southern comfort. The sides all homemade. There is sweet potates, greens, macaroni and cheese and more. Honestly, I feel sorry for you if you have not tried till its gone ( TIG) BBQ."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, great service, friendly employees and management. Food is delicious for any meal, great tasting flavor in their bbq meats everything is wonderful."}
{"text":"My wife had some lemon pepper chicken wings, and I had a rib and chicken thigh with baked beans, peach cobbler, and a cornbread muffin (one of the new Senior Happy Hour choices.)  My wife went on about how good the wings were for a solid 10min. My rib had good flavor, as did the chicken thigh, and the thigh was cooked perfectly. The cobbler was quite good. The muffin was a sweet version but tasty. The baked beans had some burnt ends mixed in, a bonus, and were decidedly tangy.  Overall I found it to be good value (the portions are not bad at all, and the thigh was on the large size indeed) and I look forward to going back whenever I don't have my own smoker going."}
{"text":"Really good BBQ. The highlights were the link sausage and pulled pork. Possibly one of the best pulled pork I've ever had. The BBQ sauce is really flavorful its tangy and smoky. Really good sauce. Service is also really nice very friendly and always smiling. I was disappointed in the ribs, was hoping it would be good but it was alright. No brisket sadly but overall a really good BBQ place in north Las Vegas! Check it out."}
{"text":"Was craving some bbq and decided to try this place! Customer service was great!! Miss T was so nice and welcoming and the gentleman i didn't get his name but he was nice as well. The prices are really good in my opinion and the portions are good. I waited for about 20-25 mins which was a little upsetting, my food came hot and fresh BUT i did not like the flavor of the baked beans there's no flavor just a bunch of Bbq sauce and beans, the Mac n Cheese is ok, and my meats were tender and not dry. This is a nice place to try and give a chance but i probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Let me tell you, I had the ribs with two sides. Mac and cheese and baked beans. So good!!!!' You have to try it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food as there was great service. Met the owner Anthony and was impressed  Good portions and good prices."}
{"text":"Great BBQ place. I had a burger today and it was nothing short of spectacular.  It was a specialty burger that was juicy and full of flavor.  Their BBQ Beans are some of the best I have ever had.  The owners are great and are introducing new items all the time.  They have said they will be introducing brisket, and other beef items in the near future.  You can not go wrong with a visit to this establishment."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the tasty ribs and pulled pork. Sides are exceptional, especially the collard greens and mac and cheese. BBQ sauce is quite nice. Prompt and polite service in well designed layout. Although a journey for me, I consider it worth the trip. Highly recommend."}
