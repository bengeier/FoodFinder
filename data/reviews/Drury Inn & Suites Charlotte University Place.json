{"text":"I just wanted to start this review off by telling you all that the Drury Inn's have been the best hotels I have ever been to (I have been to their hotels three separate times). So yes, after the third perfect stay with this hotel chain, I had to write a five star review to show everyone how truly amazing this company is.
When we arrived with our family of six, our original rooms were not adjoining. They saw our facial expressions when they broke the news and immediately got to work on fixing it. We ended up with adjoining rooms thanks to the kind people behind the desk!
There was a great pool area (indoor/outdoor meaning that half the pool is indoor and the other half is outdoor!) that included a hot tub as well as tables and chairs. 
The rooms were clean and spacious, with a full body mirror, closet, desk, chair, TV, dresser, nightstand and obviously bed (we had two but it depends on which room you have). The bathrooms were spotless and had plenty of towels and soaps! 
There is also a free breakfast buffet in the morning that is absolutely wonderful!
BONUS: Until 10:00 PM there are free popcorn and soda machines to snack on :)"}
{"text":"Was disappointed in this hotel. Read all the great reviews and looked forward to it. Hotel is definitely outdated. I had to switch rooms because the AC in my room wasn't working properly.  The breakfast was ok but the afternoon snack they put out was not good at all. One day it was cold chicken fingers and the next it was cold hot dogs and poor looking baked potatoes. Both days we took one bite and couldn't eat anymore. The staff at the hotel is very nice and accommodating. I would say this is an average 3 star hotel and not what the other high ratings make it out to be."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this hotel.  Free wifi, free hot breakfast, good location but what differentiates this Drury from several others in Charlotte is the extremely friendly staff.  Very attentive and accommodating especially the manager.  I usually stay at the Northlake Drury but now I am staying at University location.  I feel like they went the extra mile for me."}
{"text":"They are pet friendly (with a small fee), give various discounts and give so many free perks!  This is the only hotel that offers free hot breakfast that is not only delish but you dont have to be up at the crack of dawn to enjoy. Dinner is also free and yummy did I mention they offer free drinks? YUP they do!
Room was nice and clean and pool and spa were a delight for this weary traveler
(this review is for Marion IL AND Charlotte NC THIS PLACE ROCKS EVERYWHERE :)"}
{"text":"Stayed here after a KISS concert at the Verizon Ampitheater. Super close to the venue, got a great rate ($75). Great if you are looking for a no frills place that is still comfy, but doesn't look like you landed in Skid Row. We missed the free Happy Hour, but that's a good perk as well. Room was very nice, clean, and the soap, shampoo, and conditioner dispenser in the shower was pretty cool. Would stay again!"}
{"text":"I stayed at this hotel since I was traveling for work, and it had to be the most pleasant hotel stays I've ever been a part of!  They greet you every time you come in the door, they check with you before walking out of the door to see if you need anything, and no matter what, if you walk by someone that works there, they greet you and see if you need anything and how things are going! The hotel was very up-to-date and though it's not the biggest hotel out there, it's as big as it needs to be for traffic coming through. If you have ever been curious, go stay there! You won't be disappointed at this Drury Hotel! I didn't pay for this trip, but if I had to next time I will most definitely! I was shocked at how low the rates are for what you get!"}
{"text":"I have stayed in this location before, a couple of years ago. I remember it being a decent place to stay for the night. We were expecting the same but got MORE! They have renovated the lobby area since the last time I was there. Arrived during a busy check-in time but was helped promptly. The smell of popcorn was amazing. We checked-in and helped ourselves to the popcorn and soda. Sweet! Our room was between the meeting room and gym on the main floor. We expected to hear lots of foot traffic as we were on the main hallway. We were pleasantly surprised that we had no noise issues. The bed was comfy and he room was neat. It was a great evening. The staff was very friendly. Definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"Stayed here for a week. The staff were exceptionally friendly. They had the best free hot breakfast I've ever had at a hotel. The free happy hour was good too. The room was nice and clean, had free wifi, and a great rate of $69/night."}
{"text":"Every employee greeted us happily and sincerely.  KUDOS
Rooms were comfortable, clean, and updated.
Breakfast buffet options were thorough and well done for a hotel/inn!
Sorry to have missed the awesome Managers Reception both nights.  We were caught up in local awesomeness.
Yes we heard the elevator motor and doors shutting, but the pro's outweigh the con's for sure, and really... best digs in the neighborhood.
We'll be back~

And \"Thank You\" to all the staff who made our stay wonderful."}
{"text":"My mom and I stayed here for two nights over a holiday weekend. The room was very clean, and the staff were the friendliest of any hotel I've ever stayed in. It isn't fancy, but we were very comfortable. The place is going through renovations, so it was quite loud on Saturday afternoon, but it was quiet through the night and all day on Sunday. We came to Charlotte for IKEA, and this place is very close. It was also really easy to get to NoDa and uptown. We enjoyed the free hot breakfast of eggs, biscuits, sausage, and gravy. Each night, we each got two drinks and snacks (could easily serve as dinner). I highly recommend this hotel. Again--nicest staff ever!"}
{"text":"Lots of amenities, but lacking in the basics. This hotel is fairly priced, and includes a hot breakfast in the morning and an evening \"kickback\" with a rotating menu. There's also a popcorn machine that's free to access all day and a soda machine for your convenience. Upon checking in, those of us 21+ receive an evening drink card, good for two complimentary adult beverages. Sounds great, right? 

Now, here are the negatives. The bed is a glorified trampoline. It is very hard and even the slightest move will jar your bed partner. The shower/toilet room is very small, and if you're taller than 5' 5\" then your knees will touch the door while you're using the facilities. The bathtub is very small and the soap dish is the perfect height to hit your head on (if you're my height) or your shoulder on (if you're my husband).

Overall, I would say this place is just fine for a quick weekend stay, but anymore than 2 or 3 nights and you should find a different hotel."}
{"text":"It's a nice place to stay. It's clean and a friendly staff. Complimentary food and drinks if you want to partake. Places to eat within walking distance too."}
{"text":"Stayed here for one night last night. I have absolutely no complaints. Very clean, good breakfast and nice staff. Probably the best hotel I've been to in this price range."}
{"text":"Excellent  hotel!  My husband and i stayed here for the Coca Cola 600 2014 and it was very nice. Employees are great and very helpful, the guest were great also, very nice people in Charlotte, NC. Would stay again for sure."}
{"text":"This hotel was a little pricey to me but for what I paid we got the suite and it was worth it! The pool and hot tub were great for the kids. I got two free check in drinks and there is free popcorn in the lobby all day for the kids. Melissa and another gentleman helped me check in and the bartender was also a pleasure. All in all I recommend this hotel."}
{"text":"Nice hotel. They were In the middle of renovations when i went but I had no complaints. Its no Hilton or anything but a lot more reasonably priced and still decent."}
{"text":"Great price for what you get.   Very comfortable beds!!!  Very very clean rooms.  Indoor/outdoor pool.  Great for kiddos.  And to top it off.  I free cocktail for the adults during their kickback.   Great food for all during the kickball and breakfast.   I'm talking restaurant quality!!!  Kudos to a great hotel with a friendly staff.  Be Proud!!"}
{"text":"We stayed here after a long flight back from Aruba and had wanted a nicer hotel to stay at.

We chose the Drury due to the reviews we saw about the 'added' perks. The popcorn/soda and movies they show in the evenings as well as 'happy hour' with free drinks & food. We came too late to enjoy some of those perks but it was a nice stay overall. The rooms were decent with free wifi.

The breakfast was above average and was very crowded. There was a huge line (unsure if we had a few groups staying there or what).

Would recommend."}
{"text":"The service in this hotel is beyond excellent. We stayed for several days with a 93 year old, and the staff went above and beyond the call of duty to accommodate our special needs, with a smile, every time. The rooms are clean, the pool is lovely, and you couldn't ask for more at this very reasonable price."}
{"text":"I can't wait till next month till my birthday I love the Drury and Free food and drinks I'm legally to get alcoholic beverages"}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a night when we were in Charlotte for a concert.

Located in the University Park area of Charlotte, it is about a 15 minute drive from downtown (uptown), however, it is much more reasonably priced than the hotels in that area which is why we chose to stay here. There are lots of chain restaurants nearby with TGI Friday's sharing the same parking lot.

We arrived in time for the (free) happy hour. We were given two drink tickets, good for beer, wine or mixed drinks. My husband and I both went for cocktails, which were good. They also had a lot of food set out, including pasta with meatballs, hot dogs, nachos, veggies and salads. Definitely much more than expected from a free happy hour and enough to make a light dinner if we didn't already have other plans.

Our room was a pretty standard hotel room, but it was noticeably clean and clearly well-taken care of. I think they allow dogs at this hotel, but you would never know by how clean the whole place is. Wifi was also free in the hotel rooms.

The bed was a little on the harder side from what I'm used to at home, but still pretty comfortable. In the mornings they have a free breakfast buffet with items like biscuits and gravy, waffles, scrambled eggs, etc. Unfortunately, we slept too late after the concert to make it by the cut-off time (9:30 AM).

They also offer free soft drinks and popcorn all afternoon until the evening for guests of the hotel.

Overall, as mentioned, this is a pretty standard hotel as far as the standard rooms, but the extra free perks, the reasonable price and the cleanliness of the place make this a hotel that I would definitely recommend to others when looking for a place to stay in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good price, Pet friendly, great location, and clean! Nice areas to walk your dogs!

Downfall....I felt like I was sharing a room with my neighbors. I heard them moving around, opening and closing doors, talking, arguing..... it was hard to sleep because of that and the fact my dog kept thinking they were coming in our room. Limited sleep."}
{"text":"Booked this hotel from the reviews I read. The hotel is pretty outdated...but makes up for it in the hotel staff. My flight from Ca was delayed twice and I did not end up getting in to Charlotte till 2am. When I first got there an older gentleman greeted me and immediately made me feel extremely welcome. He checked me in quickly, gave the quick run down on all the hotel amenities and even offered me some warm pop corn and said I could get some soda from the beverage machine in the dining room.  I had room 303 which was super clean and comfortable. 

The next morning with very little sleep I was starving so I headed down to the complementary breakfast. The small buffet had scrambled eggs, sausage patties, home frys, biscuits & gravy, bagels, oatmeal, yogurt and you could make homemade waffles. They also offered coffee & juice plus soda if you want. I personally did not care for it and that was only morning I ate there. It wasn't cause the food was bad... I  don't eat eggs, sausage or oatmeal....it is a texture thing. I much prefer the freshness of Embassy Suites breakfast. Again it is just a preference thing. 

Later that afternoon was the evening reception. Each adult is issued a card where they can order 2 alcohol drinks for free. I don't drink alcohol so I can't really say what the offered...however I did see wine and beer on tap. They also offer a hot buffet..most nights it was pasta, meatballs, baked potatoes, chili, another soup of the day, a very very tiny salad bar, hot dog and nacho bar plus the soda and pop corn. 

During the first nights buffet a HUGE group of teenage rugby playing boys all came with their chaperons to the hotel...later that evening around 10:45 pm they were all still downstairs in the lobby / atrium doing rugby moves jumping over furniture and being as loud as if they were at an outdoor concert. To heighten the craziness the hotel does allow dogs and my neighbor had a small dog that they had left in the hotel room for most of the day and almost all of the evening. when a small dog is lonely he barks a LOT... Because of these two issues I went down stairs the next morning and went to speak with the lady [Amy] at the front desk. Amy was EXTREMELY apologetic..Poor thing I was like the 6th person to talk to her about the issue.  she changed my room, she also discounted my bill which would have been fine just those two things however 10 minutes later there was a knock on my new room door and it was Amy holding a bag with a handwritten note. In the bag was 2 bottle of water, fruit snacks, cheese and crackers, candy bars and a bag of trail mix, Talk about going above and beyond, you never see that anymore. The rest of my stay was very quite....I am now a lifetime customer Drury hotel chain."}
{"text":"The room is clean, the bed is comfortable, the hotel is quiet. I like that the bath/shower is separate from the sink. They offer free wi-fi, free breakfast, free long distance, and free happy hour drinks from 5:30-7pm. The room has many charging outlets. Good quality TV. Overall, a nice room for a good price. My one complaint is that the \"heater\" blows cold air when you turn the heat on, so it is better to just have it off or you make the room colder instead of warmer, which is not what you want in January."}
{"text":"Excellent stay...pet friendly clean hotel.  Comp Breakfast a great way to get your day started.  Comp lite fare and drinks in the evening are a great way to end your day.  Staff is helpful courteous and friendly.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have stayed at the Drury for work somewhere probably north of 100 nights! 

The staff are amazing! For the money you can't beat it at all!

I have accumulated a lot of points and now I can use them when I take my family on vacation to Disney!!!"}
{"text":"We will  be staying here again!  Katie, the check in employee, was very friendly and helpful. They gave us an anniversary goodie bag at our departure.
Great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended hotel for the $80-$120/night price point.  The staff is very friendly and always have a great attitude.  They offer a great free breakfast and two free drinks for happy hour.   The rooms are very clean and comfortable.   I will definitely stay here again."}
{"text":"Clean room and comfy beds! Staff were super friendly and rates are very reasonable. They allowed my three dogs for $15! Hotel is very clean and didn't have a funky smell like most pet friendly places. Breakfast had large variety of items (hot cooked oatmeal, waffle station, yogurt, bagels, donuts, pastry, yummy buttery scrambled eggs and to-die-for fresh biscuits and gravy). Will def be back if we ever come up this way again!"}
{"text":"OK so a Drury Inn isn't a Hilton or Marriott, but you're not paying the same rack rate. This hotel was clean and furniture looked pretty new. Staff was very friendly (or maybe it's just the South) and helpful--the manager helped clear garbage cans from the breakfast area. They offer a couple of free happy hour drinks, which I alas was unable to partake of as I was out and about at that time.  Room was clean and TV worked. They have a popcorn machine in the dining area so the hallways smell of popcorn. Kind of odd but also kind of pleasant."}
{"text":"Another great Drury.  May have to make them my permanent travel choice.  One of the few places that has a true breakfast.  They even have donuts for those of us who start our day with coffee and donuts. The evening get together can be used as a dinner place.  Staff was very helpful in helping us locate area businesses.  They were more than happy to leave us to ourselves.  When I travel I only need clean sheets and not full maid service.  Only draw back is there are no local newspapers or USA Todays available."}
{"text":"Very friendly service; freebies galore: Internet, parking, breakfast, dinner, 2 drinks per night. Nice indoor/outdoor pool with swim-under divider and cozy jacuzzi. Easy access in and out. Love it!"}
{"text":"Free soda, free popcorn, free breakfast. Complimentary everything!!!! Service people are all very nice! scored a Priceline deal and honestly one of the best hotel chains I've stayed at for the price. No complaints considering it was everything I needed and under my budget. Jacuzzi and Pool were nice also and the room was clean"}
{"text":"We stayed here for our nephew  high school graduation for two nights. Great customer  service , clean room , pet friendly.  Free breakfast  but was same menu daily.  It would be nice if they mixed it up breakfast menu. This is why I gave them four stars. Also had difficulty finding somewhere to walk my two dogs."}
{"text":"Great hotel at a good price. We came in late and needed a room. Everything I looked at was booked. Michael at the front desk was great. He was friendly and helpful.  The room was clean as was the bathroom.  I would stay here again."}
{"text":"Never stayed at a Drury Inn before. That's gonna change, hospitable employees, free food at night, free hot breakfast, 2 free drinks at bar between 530-7 for all guests. Don't book through hotels.com or booking.com prices don't change and they just pester you with emails falsely advertising 50% off. Great AAA discount almost 30$."}
{"text":"First time I've stayed here and it was amazing! Great, friendly staff that went out of their way to make us comfortable. Free drinks at Kickback Hour and good full service breakfast. Will definitely be back!"}
