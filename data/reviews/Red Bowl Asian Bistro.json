{"text":"To start on a positive, the prices are great! The service is fantastic.  However, the sushi is mediocre. I would compare it to what you can get at the grocery store. So if you aren't a sushi snob, this place is worth heading to. If you are, come anyway but order something else."}
{"text":"Good local Chinese!  I have been to the Red Bowl twice.  I must say, I thought it would be the no-atmosphere fast food Chinese restaurant since it sits in a strip mall next to Harris Teeter in Mountain Island Lake. You would probably only go there if you lived in that area or were stocking up at the nearby Walmart. YOU WILL BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED! The restaurant is bigger than expected with a two tiered dining room.  Both times the servers were nice and attentive to our needs. As for the menu- there was no lemon chicken. I thought that was a staple on a Chinese food menu. Who doesn't like lemon chicken?? I got the sesame chicken instead and it was a little over cooked, which was disappointing. The second time I got the hibachi steak which was excellent.  This place has specials during the week like $4 cocktails and other sushi specials which I always appreciate. I have seen a coupon in the Valpak that comes in the mail for half off an entree which is always a plus."}
{"text":"I always enjoy coming here the sushi is really good! They are my favorite. Their red curry shrimp is really good. The staff and service are great. Their always so sweet."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy.  We went there for lunch. Ate so good that I didn't want to go back to work.  I had enough food for dinner, it's 6pm and I'm still  smacking my lips.  Get the bowl, lots of food for lil money.   I hope to convince my coworkers to go again tomorrow.  Hmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner on a Monday night. Ordered a martini, it was not received till after I got my dinner which was cold veggies.... The avocado rolls are pathetic in size. Save your money, fast china is better than this place."}
{"text":"The first word that comes to mind when I reflect on my visit was \"sticky\". There was nothing glaringly gross or unhygenic at Red Bowl near Callabridge but I feel the restaurant definitely could've used a though wipe down of it's surfaces. Pushing that out of my mind and automatically deducting one star off my review, I pressed forward with my meal. Our server (Tara, a lovely young lady) was prompt with our food and drink orders and the atmosphere was relaxing and uncomplicated. I ordered the Bento box, a relatively popular order from what I can surmise, which came with your choice of soup, 6 rolls, an entree, and a styling of rice for 11.95. The food itself was pretty unremarkable. I enjoyed my meal but wasn't blown away/didn't taste anything that would entice me to return.   Red Bowl is deserving of the three star average it currently maintains. Nothing special; the word mediocre comes to mind but I feel that may have a more harsh connotation for most people than it does for me. It's...ok"}
{"text":"I really love coming here when I get a craving for some Asian cusine!!  A friend told me about this place years ago and I have been going for about 8 years or so.  And since it is on our side of town that's a bonus!  Have tried many different things on the menu.  And have enjoyed them all.  Everyone is always so friendly when they greet you and wait on you.  We particullary like Eddie!  Always happy :)  We have also been to 2 of the other ones.  The one in Cary and Burlington.  They are also very nice."}
{"text":"Ive eaten at this location 5 times of which the last 3  since moving here from KC. The first last August on vaca here was awesome with great food with a short wait and one of the best waitresses we've had!   The next visit was last November while we were looking for a house here where it was still  great with friendly wait staff but the food wasn't as good as the first time but was still very good.   However, we have moved here now and have been back three times since mid Dec.  Very convenient on Sundays.  Gradually and regrettably the last 3 have gotten progressively worse.  Food quality and consistency as well as trained wait staff have both suffered. Staff is still trying and polite but seemed to lack training and leadership from the management. The last visit today, the Pad Thai (which I love) was bland, overcooked noodles and the shrimp smelled and tasted funny to me (almost tainted).   I told the obviously new waiter and asked to order something else of which he gave me the courtesy of.  BUT, the manager came over afterward to inquire and I explained as nicely as I could. He then scolded me for expecting to get an exchange dish for free after sending the first back because I must have ordered something I just didn't like and there was nothing wrong with his food. He announced that he would let it go this time but in the future if I ordered something I didnt simply \"like\" he would charge me for the inferior dish and be happy to sell me another dish if I'd like to try something else. He got on to the waiter (I did see him do the same thing to a different young waiter over another customer the last time we visited) and told my waiter he was paying for the bad Pad Thai dish that I returned.  I wasn't going to let this happen as the Rookie did the right thing. I paid for the bill ($24) and gave my waiter a $14 tip to cover him and the dish he said he would be charged for. That seemed ridiculous to me, poor kid was trying to do the right thing.  I don't ask for anything free and offered to pay for the Pad Thai to the manager, which was when he told me he'd \"let it go\" this time.  Really? My 16 year old was so embarrassed by his rude behavior that she doesn't want to go to that location again.   Just thought I'd offer my experiences. If you go I wish you better luck with the manager than I had:-)  Bon Appetit. I'm 47 years old by the way and was there with my 3 daughters."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. Great value for what you spend and how much food you get. Wish it was closer to my house."}
{"text":"Prices were reasonable, but the food not that impressive. Sushi roll didn't have much fish in it, and the bourbon chicken was only ok, and would have better if had more veggies, like broccoli, etc.  It still gets 3 stars because for a cheap chain one doesn't have high expectations."}
{"text":"We go once or twice every couple of months. The food quality is pretty consistent and what you would expect for a place like this. I have never gotten a dish that i was disappointed about. The Singapore street noodles are great and the egg drop soup is fantastic. We can get out with a family of 3 1/2 and pay less then $30. A+ in my book!"}
{"text":"I'd like to give Red Bowl more stars because the food is really good and the prices are very reasonable,  especially the lunch specials. Plenty a food that tastes great.   Management needs to focus on customer service. No one was rude and seating was quick. The wait staff was busy (maybe understaffed?) but friendly. With better staffing prices could probably even be reasonably increased without customers noticing or complaining.   Keep making great food. Help your team out with better staffing or training. That's all that is needed."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this location and everyone is always very friendly, especially the bartender. However, I was not as impressed tonight (Labor Day 2016) because the male host did not seem very friendly. I work in restaurants and he just didn't have good customer service for what I am used to here. I would still recommend though because I think (I hope) maybe it was just an off night for him."}
{"text":"I arrived at 9:37 but they stopped seating at 9:30pm. The lady at front desk seemed unapologetic and did not seem interested in our business."}
{"text":"I like coming here for the sushi that is fresh and alot of selections to choose from, but the restaurant is stifling hot- for some reason the owner does not like to turn it down to make it comfortable for the patrons as well as the staff- it's not like a recent A/C issue with the unit, it has always been this warm from the get- go ( several years now) Other than that, if you like sushi in a \"tropical climate \" than you're good to go-"}
{"text":"N.B.  The prices shown on their website-- and on their Take Out flyer-- are for Lunch only. At dinner time the price almost doubles.  Since I haven't been to lunch, I have no idea if the portions are also doubled or if you get more protein with your entree at that price.    Food was just okay.  Not memorable, except for the surprise when the bill was presented."}
{"text":"I feel the woman that takes orders for takeout should be a little more friendly towards everyone. I noticed she seems to be friendlier towards people who are non-black but I thought I was imagining it and never said anything to anyone. I continued to get take out because my 12 year old liked the food. I wasn't crazy about it. When my 12 year old child mentioned out of nowhere when he ordered take out how he noticed the same response from the woman. When my child notices that's where I draw the line. I don't think I will be returning there. I can find somewhere else to spend my money and where the food definitely tastes better."}
{"text":"Used to be very good. Has gone down hill. Bang bang shrimp was not fully cooked (could see and taste uncooked batter).  I gave it a couple of tries at the new location. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food, but if you do take out, be sure to check your large orders. Other than that I love their sushi!"}
{"text":"Horrible service . Walked in about 3pm Sunday. Got totally ignored by the waitress. She saw me and did not acknowledge me at all . I had to ask her do we just sit down ??? She said you can . I wanted to walk out but my girlfriend said let's stay. The food was tasteless I order the red curry chicken I had to keep adding soy sauce to give taste. The person who ignored us looked like she was in a rush to go home ... she had short wavy blondish hair just incase the owner wanted to know which women it was ..."}
{"text":"We had a terrible lunch here. In my opinion the beef was not really beef, something very fatty I've never tasted before. I returned it for the chicken which was not good either. My husbands scallop meal consisted of one scallop sliced very thin into four pieces. The manager did not care about our experience, if he/she would have cared they would have asked. Would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is okay given the location and that there isn't any other real options unless you want to drive out of mountain island area. I have had their sushi which is good, but nothing special. Their chinese dishes are lacking heat. Location is the only reason I gave it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch hours and it wasn't really busy, but for some reason it took 15 minutes before I got any service. Two people walked in after me and got service before me. The food is ok, nothing spectacular. I use to love this spot, but they've fallen off."}
{"text":"We have been eating here for 5 years and I'm sad to say the food has become greasy and the recent price increase is ridiculous.  3 dishes, no egg rolls with and only rice with 2 for $40.54 is just not good.  Also this was carry out with no drinks."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Went here for a last minute birthday dinner. I ordered a spicy tuna sushi roll for an appetizer and the mango chicken for my main course. The sushi was awful. It tasted as if it had been sitting for hours and not fresh at all. My chicken was undercooked and cold. And my steamed rice was crispy and cold. The wait staff was more concerned with cleaning up for the night than they were being our servers and the store had plenty of time left for closing."}
{"text":"I love this place. We live across the street and are so glad they moved from Promenade to the Fincher Farm location. Lots of sushi options and great bento boxes with lots of food for the money. All of the Asian staples and a nice atmosphere to sit down and have a meal. We feel comfortable bringing our kids but it also makes a good date night away. Welcome to the neighborhood Red Bowl!"}
{"text":"Decent food. Ordered some sushi rolls. What stands out about this place was the hostess's attitude. It was down right rude and extremely chilly. I didn't get that vibe when she seated the patrons in front of us. Hate to bring race into the issue but I am of Asian decent and the patrons ahead were Caucasian. The funny thing is the hostess is Asian as well. Sad this place gave me that vibe. I will not be coming back. Our servers attitude was a little warmer but at least she treated everyone the same. Bad experience"}
{"text":"Meh.  2nd time dining at this location. The first was back in July and it was fine. Tonight was a little disappointing.  I got the Moo Shu Pork and it looked a bit old and really watery.  There looked to be about 3 pounds of the stuff.  Not much flavor but I ate it with 2 of the pancakes and called it.  I picked through the bowl and took home the rest of the pork but I will probably end up tossing it.    The Sesame Chicken was actually really good so I would stick with that or some fried rice."}
{"text":"Not bad for take out. Decent prices, staff is always nice. Only complaint (not really) is that when I tell them spicy they never really make it spicy. I guess American spicy? Generals chicken is good as is wonton soup. Bang bang shrimp was gross but I didn't realize it had spicy mayo on it. I hate mayo :(."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town love it you have to try Red Bowl Deluxe sushi roll. Service is terrific. Prices affordable"}
{"text":"Way more expensive than the Red Bowl & NOT WORTH IT. I paid $36 for two obviously old spring rolls that were soggy in the middle and had some mysterious black stuff in them, two over cooked shrimp tempura rolls, a sweet potato roll & two side salads that were ok. Slow service and a high price tag!"}
{"text":"This is our 2nd time at Red Bowl at this new location at Fincher Farm in Matthews.  We haven't been in a long time, as we prefer Thai Food.  But Red Bowl is very close to our house.  Wow.  In a bad way.  We have never had such flavorless food - ever.  And that's saying a lot.  This was a carry out order, so I don't know if that makes a difference.  We got chicken with asparagus, Seafood Double Pan Fried Noodles and pork fried rice.  The rice had a hint of flavor, but the two main dishes were bland and tasteless.  Thank God we had some sriracha sauce and soy sauce at home.  The seafood dish came with a box of a glob of hard noodles.  Yuck.  We did order the pork pot stickers, and they were really good.  My husband says there were very few people in the restaurant when he picked up the order; now we know why.  We really wanted to like this place, but will not be returning.  We paid a lot for all of these orders, and rather than having some for leftovers, we had to pitch it.  It's hard to imagine how anyone can prepare a Chinese dish with no flavor."}
{"text":"Excellent service, very friendly, and great food. Here is a picture of their spicy scallop!"}
{"text":"We always get take out and are never disappointed. They seem to knock it out of the park everytime!! Some of our favorites are mongolian beef, wonton soup, pad thai and the sushi."}
{"text":"Omg!!! FINALLY AN AMAZING CHINESE FOOD IN MATTHEWS!!! We had the sweet and sour chicken with fried rice! Love that the chicken has large cooked slices of carrots, onions, and red pepper, & pineapple. Also had the Teriyaki chicken with sesame seeds and grilled veggies!! Broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, onions, zucchini! All sautéed together in an amazing sauce! White rice is good too. Egg rolls are very good too! Worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"We had lunch there today 4/29/18 because we havent been to Red Bowl in a while. When we walked in there was a smell that was a turn off. Waitress came and took our drink order which took forever to get. When taking our food order I wanted sweet n sour chicken and was advised they didnt have sweet n sour chicken today. Not sure why because harris teeter is right beside it and if they was out of something could have went there and got what they needed but i settled for seasame chicken. My wife ordered beef n broccoli and 2 spring rolls and I had an egg roll. The egg roll tasted like it had been sitting most of the day and was barely warm. When our food came out it was just as awful. The fried rice wasnt good and was like it had been sitting a while. Seasame chicken had a funking taste to it and wasnt that good as well. We had to ask another waitress for our bill to leave because our waitress was missing. When our waitress did take our bill i asked for a coke to go and that never came either. Needless to say today killed it for us going back to this Red Bowl!!!"}
{"text":"Good local Chinese restaurant. Usually quick and inexpensive. Large portions. Service is friendly and the food is tasty. Their sushi is decent as well. Call in your order for pickup as they can be busy at certain times. Recommend trying Red Bowl out for a quick local stop."}
{"text":"Just ok, Boubon chicken was bland and stir fry is double the price as other regular menu items and same portion size.  Good for a one time try.  Not value enough to come back again."}
{"text":"I love this place for their sushi. I usually have the Crunchy Roll, Red Bowl, and the Spider Roll. The sushi tastes fresh and some of the best I've ever had. Additionally, sushi is offered at a special price ($3.99) on Wednesdays! The dining area is warm, cozy, and offers a nice environment to conversate with friends and loved ones. I really enjoy eating here and always ask for Krystal as my waitress. She is overly eager to please and my tips always reflect her service. The only drawback about this place is that it can get busy and you may wait a few moments longer to be seated at times. Other than that, excellent bistro!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place in the Mt. Island area!  The service has always been great and prompt. My wife loves their sushi selection. I'm fond of the bento box, which is a great deal. Their sushi is very well prepared. Their grill/wok items are so fresh and well cooked, you'd think you were paying double what your bill comes to.   The atmosphere is great. Good lighting, almost like a good kept secret tucked away next to Harris Teeter. We can't recommend this enough."}
{"text":"The shrimp fried rice is awesome and only been here 3 times but the sushi has been great. If you are local to the Denver area it's worth stopping in."}
{"text":"Although this is the closest Asian/Sushi place close to where I live I would much rather take a drive to get food that's actually good and authentic. I've been and on and off customer hewre for almost ten years. Ten years ago the food was good and the sushi was excellent. Over the years every aspect of dining here has declined to the point where we will NEVER go here again. The sushi is OK if you eat it there, to go orders always suck. All the other dishes are just very ordinary fast food Chinese-take-out stuff. Always very greasy and oily even when you request very little oil. Why does it take half a cup of oil to make Lo Mein? Service is embarrassingly bad and the managers or owners are terrible. Red Bowl will never see another penny from this household."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here for dinner. I was a little turned off after the very unenergetic/annoyed hostess begrudgingly walked us over to our booth. Seriously?! Get it together!!!  Our waiter made up for the poor first impression. He was prompt and funny and made some good recommendations. We both went with the Bento Box which offers your choice of soup or salad, sushi roll, entrée and fried or steamed rice.   I went with the Hot and Sour soup. It had all the flavors I was expecting and the crispy wontons added a nice touch. For my sushi roll, I opted for the Spicy Tuna Roll. It was classic. But it didn't knock my socks off.  Finally for the entrée I went with the Spicy Mango Shrimp with steamed rice. The shrimp were large and the mango sauce was good.   This place isn't bad my any means, I just wasn't overly impressed. I may give them another chance if I'm in the area, but I'm not rushing back."}
{"text":"I'd say 3-3.5 stars, but there isn't much other good food in the area.  Sushi is good and asian fusion dishes are decent.  Lunch special is worth checking out, but I wouldn't drive out of my way for this place."}
{"text":"The best way to put it is, this place is what it is. Its super cheap and you get what you pay for. At least they have a full bar!! If you want take out type Chinese that has a little better quality then regular Chinese take out joints than this is your place. I will definitely go back and recommend that you try it at least once. Its the best place to go for Chinese if you don't want to spend a lot of money or if you don't feel like being over crowded at Pf Changs."}
{"text":"It's ok. Think about it like think about an aunt that smells weird and makes you kiss her but always gives you $20. The experience isn't the best but you end up happy."}
{"text":"I go here often and really enjoy the blend of japanese and chinese cuisine. The food is excellent, but the service can be sketchy depending on who you get. Also, don't order an expensive bottle of wine. We did, and it tasted like vinegar. The manager would not provide us with a different bottle so it just sat there full. I've asked to return a bottle of wine perhaps twice in my entire lifetime, so I don't make a habit of doing so. Was very disappointed with the response we got that night."}
{"text":"I have been eating from Red Bowl for years. The food is good. Classic Chinese style. Usually get Lo Mein, and other dishes. The folks working there are always nice and attentive. Your food is always hot and fresh."}
{"text":"A nice local option for dinner.   We were surprised how lard the bistro was, from the outside it looks like a hole in the wall but it's large enough for families of all sizes and has a cute bar area up front.   Priced right, the menu has lots of options. We decided on crab Rangoon's to start. They came out very hot (always good) and had lots of crab flavor in just a small bundle of filling. The sweet and sour was tasty with a nice pineapple flavor in there. The opportunity here would be just to plate them on a paper of some sort or even just some chopped cabbage, the plate had the oil which isn't a surprise since they are deep fried.   The entrees we shared were beef lo mein and Mongolian beef. Both had that awesome wok flavor I'm looking for with Chinese food. The lo mein could have used some more veggies for some color and texture. It had a nice flavor of garlic and savory all the way through. The Mongolian beef was also good with a hint of sweet in the dish. The dishes were a little heavy with oil but it's normal for most Chinese food. The chile oil was not spicy to us... which was a little sad.   The service was attentive and they worked as a team so that helped keep things moving."}
{"text":"Not impressed...had a Bento Box -- based on reviews.  General Tso' Chicken was nothing but fried batter with sauce, the egg roll and \"fried\" rice were mushy. Sushi roll was OK, nothing special.  Our waitress came across disengaged, not sure if she lacked confidence or hated her job."}
{"text":"I am glad that Red Bowl moved from the Promenade to Matthew (near Siskey YMCA). I went there for sushi on a Tuesday night and enjoyed a half-price bottle of wine and a Pacific Fried Roll (which was previously off the menu at the old location). I talked my girlfriend into going back on Friday night and we enjoyed a Phoenix Maki roll and a couple of bento boxes. The Phoenix Maki roll was the best roll I had in a long time. We ordered a couple of specialty drinks which were good."}
{"text":"My first time at Red Bowl ever....I was pleasantly surprised. The food was a little sweet for my taste but the tea (oolong) was great and the SERVICE from my waiter (STEVE) was outstanding! He was very attentive and provided me with great suggestions and even brought me hot oil without my request (I would have asked).  The food I would give 4 stars but STEVE gets 5 stars. What a great experience.   I had lunch - oolong tea.  Thai Basil Chicken.   Request Steve! You will have a great time."}
{"text":"Trash service.Stopped into this location to order carryout. Needless to say I'll never visit this location again, as soon as I entered a woman at the front was on the phone seemingly having a personal conversation and did not look in my direction as I stood in front of her, acknowledge me, or say she would help me. After a long while  of standing there (ignored) a man came from the back and noticed me and asked what I needed and proceeded to try to take my order...I was so frustrated I told him no thanks and walked out.   If you have another red bowl location go to that one instead."}
{"text":"This place is very convenient to my house so I stopped in one day to check it out. Ever since then i keep going back. The place is never super packed so you don't have to wait too long to get a table and the service is spot on. I only had to ask once for anything i needed and the refills/replacements kept coming without me saying a word. That to me is great service and means an excellent tip! The bento boxes are such a great deal and the food is delicious! Very flavorful and healthy portions. Try the egg drop soup, it's perfect! I always leave stuffed and have never been disappointed. They have amazing sushi specials and the sushi is fresh and taste great! i hope more people check this place out because I'm sure it's a little underrated compared to the more popular places uptown."}
{"text":"I usually get the General Tso's Chicken. It's excellent and always very tender. The atmosphere is good and the service is great as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my favorite restaurants!!!  You can find local Asian food anywhere you live. But this place is a shining gem of a bistro. Great cuisine ready to be devoured.   Everything from the food, industrial style interior design, to the staff makes this place an enjoyable eatery. Not to mention the prices are very reasonable for the quality of food you are served.  Great seating with plenty of room.   When wanting some of your favorite Asian dishes this is a place to dine!"}
{"text":"EVERY SINGLE TIME I come here, my order takes no less than 35 minutes.. what is the hold up you ask? Sushi.. doesn't matter the circumstance.. dine in, to go, sushi as an appetizer... it never fails.. this location is apparently DRIVING the struggle bus.. I honestly feel bad for the servers and to go specialist.. this is absurd.. the food is ok. Not worth the wait.. good thing the tega cay and rock hill locations are on point.. we won't be back here. (Not a huge loss for you I'm sure but hopefully this review will help you gain a better perspective of the ridiculous amount of time your guests are waiting for something that is so simple) .. and if you were wondering, 3 sushi rolls should not take 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Pot Stickers  Happy Family White Rice  Really enough said right there. Generous portions.  Taste and flavor profile was inline with what you should get.  Disappointed with the faux crab meat at the price paid for the meal. But expected."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy this restaurant when it was located in the Promenade; however, my husband and I just visited the new location for lunch.  We ordered an appetizer and meal.  My food just tasted bad. The waitress did offer to bring me something else when she noticed I did not eat my food but I declined.  Since I did not like the appetizer or the entree I didn't see the point.  I left hungry.  I don't know if they have changed their recipes or if they have new cooks but how do you mess up chicken and broccoli?"}
{"text":"I genuinely like Red Bowl. Everytime I go to eat there my food is fantastic. I always get a bento box with california roll, mongolian beef, miso soup, and brown rice. The service is always a little slow but most of the waitstaff is really nice.  Last night however I ordered takeout. I ordered the mongolian beef, my favorite, and the curry shrimp, my moms favorite. When I got home I realized my mongolian beef didnt even LOOK like it did when I dined in. Not saucy and it didnt have as much flavor. My mom said that her curry shrimp was normally not as runny as it was either. So I guess this place is PERFECT for dine in up don't order to go because they dont seem to care as much about the food then!"}
{"text":"The general tso chicken is awesome. I also loved the Singapore noodles and their house rice!"}
{"text":"Go often food is alway good. They have a diverse menu and the service is great. I enjoy the bento box as you get a complete meal including sushi for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Our waitress was nice and knew what she was doing. Very good service. The dining area is dimly lighted and nice. As for the food, it was alright...   -The bang bang shrimp is sweet, not spicy whatsoever unless you mean pepper? -Viet summer roll does not have vermicelli noodles just to let you know (but it was okay for me because I prefer extra lettuce)  -Peanut sauce for the roll is salty. No need to dip a lot or its overpowering, it should be sweeter. -Sushi is normal, not bad at all.  That's about it... I'll probably come back to try other dishes --- any recommendations?"}
{"text":"A little bit pricey but the food is incredible. Best Crab Rangoon I HAVE EVER HAD. I don't think I have ever ordered anything from here that isn't good. Try the Bento Box!"}
{"text":"There's not much to choose from in this area so I frequent red bowl as they have a nice variety of asian cuisine and a nicely priced lunch menu. They also have a sushi menu.  The food is pretty good. Good enough for me to come back.  The ambiance is also good. Though I personally don't like that it's kind of dark during lunch hours but for dinner it's fine.  The service is awesome. My drinks are never empty and the servers are always checking on us."}
{"text":"The food is descent but what I didnt like is when I went to pick up my order I handed the lady my money. She gave me my change but placed it on the table.  I hate that because that's not how I gave her the money.  Obviously her mannerism is lacking.  I may be back, but we will see."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed lunch at this place. Very reasonable prices as well as quick service. The restaurant is clean and tidy as well. I ordered the chicken and broccoli and egg roll lunch special. The food was tasty and fresh. I also ordered the pan fried dumplings which were also fresh tasting and nicely made. I would recommend this place for a quick bite or even as carry out."}
{"text":"This restaurant, located basically in my back yard, is making my Yelper mind crazy.  It is terribly inconsistent from visit to visit.  My basic 2-star rating still holds true, but recently we had a very positive dinner with three other couples which was just fine.  Conclusion:  like buying a British car, it depends on when it is made, what day and time of day and if there is not a soccer championship or other event going on at the same time.  What that means is that at this Red Bowl it totally depends on who is working the kitchen.  Won Ton soup was golden yellow chicken broth which tasted like chicken broth.  The won tons were not their usual storage systems for sage, but were lightly seasoned, delicious and cooked through.  Although I had planned to just have some appetizers I did maintain loyalty to Yelp! by ordering a meal.  I had the vegetable spring rolls and black pepper chicken.  Wife had green chicken curry.  Spring rolls were perfect, accompanied by horseradish and plum sauces.  My black pepper chicken was delicious, full of pepper and cooked spicy and nicely.  Rice was fresh, not gummy or burned.  Green curry also flavorful and although not as good as Thai-made, was OK.  Both wife and I were as pleasantly surprised as we were stunned.  There might be hope here, but I will need to be dragged there to give it another reluctant try.    Wonder if I can find out which crew cooked this time and ask when they will be in kitchen again?    Hummmmmmm..."}
{"text":"Terrible experience tonight, ordered food as we walked out from Disney on ice at time warner arena because we wanted to stop and grab it quickly to get the kids home in bed.... Informed it would be 20-25 minutes but more like 20 minutes. We arrived and paid and was told 5 more minutes. 10 minutes later no food and at this point our food had been called in 35 minutes, we ask for refund. Of course a manager had to process the refund transaction, so the lady calls for a manager then proceeds to take other customers orders, the manager walks up and I guess they only have one computer, so we are still waiting... Waiting without food and without a refund.... I looked at my husband and said we can dispute the charge with the bank. So 40 minutes later no food that we paid for and no refund. They didn't even offer us the rice that was ready for our order."}
{"text":"We hadn't visited this location in quite sometime. Went there Tuesday, 1/8/13, no wait time to be seated. For 15 minutes, no one came to our table to get drink orders.....absolutely nothing! After waiting a few more minutes, we got up and walked out. WILL NOT BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 5-6 times and honestly I've been underwhelmed. The food tastes like imitation Chinese food or something. It's like it's almost good but it's just not."}
{"text":"We had a good lunch here today. My biggest disappointment was the little pepper icon that let you know if a meal is supposed to be hot/spicy really let me down. My Red Curry Chicken was delicious, but a pretty mildly spiced curry sauce. It had zucchini and probably a whole onion worth of onion. No complaints at $5 with a tea, spring roll and fried rice. This was our first trip here and seems like a decent lunch stop if you're planning on getting groceries at Harris Teeter or the Walmart and don't want to shop on an empty stomach.   Their menu had plenty of choices that peaked our interest, but i'm guessing the $5 General Tso's is next on my list. If we do come back for dinner, i'll finally get to use that coupon in the Entertainment book."}
{"text":"I ordered take out today and made my order and was told it would take 15-20 minutes.  I arrived at the restaurant at about the 25 minute mark.  I checked in and paid and was told it would be a couple more minutes.  10 more minutes went by and I asked again what was taking so long.  The girls looked at each other and then went back to the kitchen.  At the 15 minute mark the girls came back up and were talking to each other.  I could tell by their body language something was off.  I asked them, did you give my food away to someone else?  They looked at each other and said they didn't know.  I then asked for a manger.  John came up and I pulled him aside out of ear shot of anyone else and explained my disappointment.  I asked him to knock off half my bill due to my food being given away and he reluctantly comped my entire order.  I was so happy!  He said it would take about 15 minutes.  He credited back my $40 bill and then came back 5 minutes later asking if I wanted some water or a beer.  I said a beer would be great.  John was amazing.  He is what all managers should strive to be.  Standing up when a restaurant messes up and fixing the relationship!  I was so happy with how John treated me.  I will never hesitate to come back to Red Bowl.  When and if they mess up, they will admit it, and fix it.  Thank you so much John, the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"I've had the food a couple of times with my significant other and their family. I was not impressed both times. This last time, my boyfriend got me take out sushi, I know that sushi is meant to be enjoyed in a restaurant and not out of a plastic container. He told me got some sort of crazy or spicy tuna. The tuna was subpar and all that came in the roll was the tuna and avocado....which is kind of pointless, not even crabmeat or cucumber base.  The most disapproving point of the sushi was this bright orange thick paste on top of it. It was almost like thick mayo sriacha paste with tempura flakes on top. It was disgusting. Never again."}
{"text":"Went for a late dinner. Wasn't busy so had great & fast service as expected! Brooke our server was very attentive & sweet! Food was excellent! Was our first time here & we will be back!"}
{"text":"Not the best, not the worse. Red Bowl fills that need for decent take-out which we get more than dine-in. They could step it up a notch with better quality sushi but they haven't and probably won't. Mongolian Beef, Calamari are the main reasons I go back. Also, they're in the area so convenience can trump the medium quality meals. I'm glad they're here!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is In one word amazing. You need to stop here the food is amazing and some of the best Asian food I have ever had. The staff is very kind and has excellent Customer service. I can't stress enough on how great this place is and the price are very great."}
{"text":"I tried to order take out but kept getting put on hold with barely a greeting. I called three times and was put on hold for over 5 minutes each time before just showing up. When I did arrive, they were not busy at all, most of the restaurant was empty. The young lady who took my order was nice and went to get the bartender so that I could have a drink while waiting on my food. He finally appeared, went to the couple at the end of the bar (walking by me) and then talked to a few others, walked by me AGAIN and left. No service. The lady taking the orders even noticed. The food was OK. I tried something new. Likely won't go back."}
{"text":"Our waitress was great and didn't bat at an eye at several special requests due to children and my crazy (no sugar, no grains) way of eating. The sashimi was delicious and I loved the seaweed salad. I would try Red Bowl again!"}
{"text":"The owner is incredibly rude and not a nice personality. My server was good and food was greqt..in spite of its location next to work I do jot want to return for how the owner treated me. And I witnessed him prohibiting an easy substitution requested by anothwr customer. ..who she and another guest walked out following this. Menu even suggests willingness to provide menu requests and substitution.  It is too bad the owner has such a foul personality and doesnt respect his customers."}
{"text":"The menu is a little overwhelming, but they have a separate bento box menu which is easy to navigate and you get so much food for $12. The restaurant, while in a shopping center, is nice. Its a good middle of the road restaurant when you want Asian food but you don't want to pay a fortune and you don't want cheap Chinese."}
{"text":"Not sure about the rest of the food but the hibachi bowl (chicken & shrimp) was soo salty I couldn't eat it. Boyfriend bit into a piece of chicken and said it tasted like it was injected with saline. He said his sushi rolls were OK. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is not to expensive and Really fresh and yummy great date night Service is okay the china guy with tail ponytail is super slow try to avoid him as your eaited"}
{"text":"My dining mate and I had lunch here the other day. We were the first customers and immediately seated at the first both by a friendly waitress.  As we were looking over the menu we noted how dirty the table was with sticky caked on residue so we moved to the next booth. The manager apologized, said it was very busy the evening before and did not check all the tables. Anyway we ordered soup and appetizers for lunch. The menu features a large variety of  Asian dishes in all categories  and even vegetarian choices as well as a variety of sushi, rolls, maki, Bento boxes, lunch specials, stir fry bar, customized requests, plus other Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese and hibachi dishes. The atmosphere was comfortable, prices moderate. So we ordered: miso soup, hot and sour soup, plus the Red Bowl ultimate combo for 2 which consisted of, potstickers, crab wonton, chicken egg rolls, grilled chicken satay, and Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls. Presentation of food very attractive. Both soups were tasty. My soup was  just lukewarm, dining mates soup was hot. Concerning the combo plate: chicken satay was just ok and the peanut sauce was overrly spicy, egg roll and summer rolls were tasty, wouldn't know  by taste if any  crab was in the   crab wonton.  May try here another time but not impressed at all with what we ordered."}
{"text":"Love it here! I have been coming for a couple of years and it never disappoints. Hot n sour soup, Pad thai and red chicken curry are my favorite! Friendly service &  nice ambience"}
{"text":"Great place with great food for the area. We go to this restaurant more frequently than any other. Mongolian beef and orange chicken is great!"}
{"text":"It was average in atmosphere. Not busy or even steady for lunch on a weekend. The hostess and waiter appeared they wanted to be elsewhere every time I have gone. I can cook better than this place. So this is a definitely will never do again. I'd rather do fast food to get by instead, not a place to take a first date or any date."}
{"text":"I was unable to upcharge my rice to rice noodles. This simple request was met with this response... \"Our chef refuses to do that\".  I wasn't looking to exchange but to pay for it as a side because I love Asian food but hate the rice texture. Rice noodles are usually a perfect option for me. I ended up having to get a different dish that came with rice noodles which was dry and bland in taste. I'm still confused why they wouldn't do this when I was willing to pay more to cover any extra expense.    Positives: fast service and a pleasant waitress."}
{"text":"This is my 2'd time in a week. The food is great!!  The atmosphere is horrible. Not one smile out of anyone. Tonight. Not one pleasantry. Once we finished we were finally asked about meal. It was depressing. Bartender snapped after found out I was not drinking and said Husband had to order 2 beers to sit at bar.  Just love to find a place we love to hang and have a bite and watch ballgame. Guess I will just have to get it to go and hang at home."}
{"text":"I've been to 3 different Red Bowl's and I've decided this is my go-to place for a quick, consistent Asian dish.  Each location seems to do a great job with creating specials like Bento boxes for $11, 3 piece rolls for $3, and half price sushi after 8pm.  I like a good sushi deal and that fits the bill for me.  Service is hit and miss depending on the location but this one in particular seemed to be just fine even though they seemed a bit understaffed.  I've noticed that places that require their waiters or waitresses to bus their own tables seem to have slower service.  Hmmm.....  In short, Red Bowl is a solid option for a quick bite when you are trying to avoid drive through fast food, etc."}
{"text":"Asian restaurants are always hit and miss-- overall and with individual dishes. We live close to Red Bowl so we figured we would give it a try. The Pad Thai was not great and the potstickers were good, but they were small and pricey.   However, the sesame chicken and orange chicken were amazing and would highly recommend both. They are pretty big portions-- my husband and I will probably just share one dish next time. But I can tell this will become a staple take out place for us."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for a few Years now. Needless to say service.m, the quality of food and NOW the quality of drinks have declined. Came in today and learned the bartender John quit :( he made the best Long Island ice teas. So I ordered one from the new guy and it was Horrible!! I won't order another drink from them. The meat: chicken and beef in the house lo mein and house fried rice taste \"weird\"   Besides the sushi here, I do not like the meat. Service sucks because they have maybe 2 waitresses tried to care for 20+ tables and it's not working. I love close by but it's time to find a new restaurant. We use to eat her 3-5 times a week now it's maybe once a month."}
{"text":"I got a chance to try Red Bowl yesterday evening for take out.  We checked them out online first and decided to go to the restaurant to place the order this first time.   They just recently opened so things were a bit hectic and there were tons of people waiting.  Being that this location is right next to Sun City there were plenty of people there as well as other \"locals\" who were no doubt excited for a decent restaurant to make it's entrance into this heavily growing area.  First impressions were that they did a nice job on the inside, there is a nice bar with very friendly bartenders.  While waiting for my food they hooked me and my daughter up with cold beverages.  Be warned, as Mitch said this menu is like War & Peace there are SO many choices.....Create your own Stir Fry, Thai Dishes, Chinese Dishes, Sushi, Bento Boxes it will blow you away.  I placed the order and, since it's new there was some confusion as to my special request but it was all worked out.  Wait time of 15 minutes for the food.  My wife got the Spicy Red Thai Curry (Add basil which was the confusing part).  The portion size was huge and the dish was very tasty.  Nice and spicy like she likes it.  I had the Beef Chow Fun, which were al dente strips of wide rice noodles and large strips of beef.  I enjoyed it.  My daughter had the kids Chicken and Broccoli (sauce on side) which was $3.95 and a tremendous value.  One complaint is that they stapled her to go container shut.  I get why they did it, but that is a huge no - no and very dangerous!!!  All in all, I will be back if nothing else to try the sushi.  Great value, kid friendly which will mix well with the Sun City crowd.  Since this is in such a restaurant poor area this location will do well as long as they keep up the quality and service."}
{"text":"I cannot believe the Bang Bang Shrimp costs $6.25 and I had to wait over 25 minutes for my order; I have never received an order with small, almost salad size shrimp. I also ordered the 88 Roll and it was mediocre. Jimmy could be friendlier as well."}
{"text":"Great Asian Restaurant! Delicious and fresh food for a reasonable price. Great location and beautiful decor"}
{"text":"Food is predictable but not great. The red curry chicken is probably the best thing on the menu.  We have spent a lot of money here over the years because it's convenient and close and there are not many options this side of town.  Sushi is tolerable, but expense for what you get (e.g $4.50) for two pieces of nigiri salmon. They need to get new tables as the tables always feel sticky. Luckily we have never gotten sick from eating here. Hope more restaurants come to mountain island lake."}
{"text":"For the Mountain Island location: I always have a great experience here. Although I've never dined-in, the carry-out is always fast, the service is always friendly, my order has never been incorrect and the food is two thumbs up delicious! I love their potstickers!"}
{"text":"The servers and food are fine! The owner on the other hand has no business in this business! He was rude to my coworker when she asked for help with the wi-fi and then I asked for a substitution! Oh my goodness you'd think I asked for a kidney! I offered to pay an up charge or something but he said I'd have to get what I didn't want and buy the other item(spring roll versus summer roll not a huge difference)!  I don't eat the fried items and didn't want to waste the extra food! The biggest problem is that we work in the same shopping center and have 100 office employees here that go at least three times a week and I myself go  about 3 times a week! $0.45 is worth losing loyal customers? I will not return and neither will my co-workers!!!"}
{"text":"So done with this place. The manager, Marsha, is so hard to deal with. We like the mustard sauce that you get when you eat in the restaurant but she hates putting it in to go orders.  She would have an attitude and shake her head when I would ask for some mustard sauce to go. A couple of times ago I got in an argument with Marsha about getting mustard sauce. I have never argued with a server or manager before. I told her that I would happily pay for the sauce even though you get it free when you eat in the restaurant.  Each time we order to go there it is a battle.  This time I said on the phone to include it so there would be no surprises and so she could charge me if she felt she needed to. I got my order and she said the mustard sauce was in the bag. I knew it wasn't so I asked for additional. She shook her head, said something in a different language and got the mustard sauce.  I got home and as I predicted there was no mustard sauce in the bag other than the additional ones I went back for.  It's not like this sauce is difficult to include, it is in plastic to go containers. I really don't understand it.  I do know that I will not be back."}
{"text":"best food around. i love this place because their menu has so much variety, and is not confined to just one set of taste buds. they have japanese, chinese, vietnamese, and even more food.   i really love their sushi-- i would recommend the \"pink lady\"!! their egg rolls (chicken with duck sauce) are amazing!! i grew up going here and it will always be a comfort food of mine!! if you're unfamiliar with the menu and it feels overwhelming i would recommend either the chicken fried rice or bento box (which is like a taste of everything). enjoy y'all!!"}
{"text":"Been here many, many times. Liked it a lot when they first opened. Good sushi, but they have become very inconsistent with the rest of the dishes on the menu. It's gotten to where we get a good meal only about 30 to 40% of the time and now usually leave disappointed. Money is best spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place doesn't have better reviews! I've gotten several to go orders from here and they were always correct. They customize your food if needed. Mongolian beef was good. Restaurant is nice and fancy looking. Staff has been great. Food comes out quick especially during lunch time. Egg rolls always come out piping hot! Chicken and broccoli is good too!"}
{"text":"Really not impressed with this place..It's over priced for the quality of food you get. I have been here 2 times just to give it a second chance. The sushi is subpar. If you remember the commercial about gas station sushi and not eating it, thats how I feel about this place.. The food is not that great also. It's doused in sauce and thats all you taste. I wont be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food in south Charlotte. I have never had a bad dish! Good portions, a little pricier but great quality... General Tso chicken is perfect, mongolian beef, great soups!! Check it ALL out!! Too bad, no delivery."}
{"text":"Standard Asian fair.  Not bad, but nothing outstanding.  Server was pleasant and quick."}
{"text":"I love Red Bowl and the food here. I've never had a negative experience until today. Tell me how much sense this makes. I was going to get a bento box which includes an appetizer, sushi roll, entree, and rice. I asked if I could get the sushi roll deep fried and the girl says no but you can get it deep fried if its not in the bento box. The difference is we have to send it from the sushi bar back to the chef. Um...wouldn't you need to send both back to the chef?  So she goes to check on it with another waitress comes back and says yes you can do that on the bento box but it costs $1 extra. REALLY?!?!?  What logic is that???  I can understand if they're hurting me for money or if there was an ingredient addition or change but really?!?"}
{"text":"The bourbon chicken was not bourbon chicken. It was death in a to go container. I was throwing up all night. Just don't eat it. Please. My weekend was ruined."}
{"text":"Just like all the other Matthews dwellers I was happy to find a new Chinese restaurant  in town. I was all ready to love it however, it was mediocre at best, not good not bad-meh. Bland is the best word used to describe the Pad Thai, curried chicken, and Wonton soup. .   The place is clean, the service is good, the portions are decent, and the wait for the order was quick to average. It is a store front, across from the Siskey Y in the Publix lot. Casual dress, parking lot, tv's, beer/wine.   Bottom line: Probably will not return"}
{"text":"I went to Red Bowl the first week they opened and have been a semi-regular patron for all these years.  The quality has been up and down over that period of time but mostly wavered between 3 and 4 stars with a brief, early foray into 5 star territory.  I have not written a review, mostly because I thought I had already reviewed them which turns out not to be the case.  A couple of less than stellar meals recently have made me put pen to paper, or finger to laptop key in this case to give my opinion of this long-lived Westside restaurant.  I remember when this space was a hardware store, so I have a long history here but I will limit my comments to the most recent visit.  My wife and I ordered takeout from Red Bowl for dinner and the ladies at the front desk were efficient, and very nice as always.  They have never messed up our order and are always very close in the estimated time for the food to be ready.  Aside from one \"creepy\" waiter, all the staff are usually nice when I have sat in the dining room.  The food...We got potstickers which were limp, not fried, and cool to the touch.  The dipping sauce was right out of the fridge cold.  The eggroll was cool, not fried nearly enough, limp, and worst of all tasted like old grease.  Hot and sour soup was a hit, great balance, hot and spicy with lots of goodies.  House Lo Mein had a good flavor and was hot but the noodles were too soft, and the shrimp was way overcooked.  Beef and broccoli was about as good as you get at the average buffet, beef was tender and flavorful but too much sauce and very salty.  I hate to see this place go down hill but with the great number of good Chinese restaurants in this city, I refuse to go down hill with them."}
{"text":"Food Taste: 10  Food Temp.: 10  Order Accuracy: 10  Speed of Service: 9  Server Attentiveness: 5  Host Friendliness: 8  Environment: 8  Cleanliness: 8  Restroom Clean: 9  Always good. Always! I must come here two or three times a month. The food is always hot and fresh. I love the chicken egg rolls. Pad Tai is one of my favorite dishes. The Drunken Noodles is a must try. The Singapore Rice Noodles is another fav. The service is probably the weakest link. There are a few amazing servers, but they are few and far between. What a gem for this part of Charlotte that desperately needs better/more restaurants."}
{"text":"I love red bowl so I was super excited when I saw my new work had one across the street! Food is always awesome and hot!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My husband and I go here at least 3x a week. They have daily specials. I love Thursdays...definitely go check it out!!"}
{"text":"It is delicious, consistent and a great atmosphere! I go there like once a week yum!!!"}
{"text":"More buffet quality, than cooked to order.  I've never been impressed.  Find yourself a family owned \"New York Style Chinese\" restaurant and you'll be much happier.    If you're looking for a half step above mall food court chinese, then this is your place.  But who wants that kind of experience?  Not I."}
{"text":"I have not been here in seven years but I was not disappointed.  Chicken Lo Mein ordered spicy was great and the Hot and sour soup was on point.  My two friends also loved everything they ordered.  Nice to have a good Chinese restaurant around even if it is a drive for me."}
{"text":"Very tasty compared to the other Asian restaurants in the area.. They are probably the best. Not the cheapest by far but def the best quality. Inside is nice and customer service is good but not a good place to pick up Chinese food and take home for the family. It will end up costing too much. Eating inside and enjoying the venue is better."}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars for service but 1 star for food .. stopped by and ordered 2 sweet and sour chicken dinners to go .. the portions very large but the chicken was cooked to rubber .. i mean it looked amazing but it was so so overcooked it was like trying to chew on piece of wood .. we were very disappointed.. we haven't been back .. maybe it was just the cook that day .."}
{"text":"This place was delicious.  I am glad they opened this up so close to us. I had the kung poa chicken with noddles and it was full of flavor. I wish it was a little spicier but I will ask for that next time. The portions were large and I was able to eat half and take the other half home. Can't wait to go here again."}
{"text":"Fantastic food quality - better than most I have ever had. Crazy night to go - Xmas Day - but, other than packed house and wait, staff super-friendly, food out in reasonable time looking great, 4 nice/big TVs tuned to big games, and lots & lots of smiling faces with their faces stuffed full of delicious food. Can't wait to go on a slow night!"}
{"text":"i like this place 1. bc is close to my house 2. is cheap 3. they have thai&japanese&and chinese food all together and the combo box is cheap compares to pf.chang and others asian places around charlotte.  i like the stuff they're really helpful. i will be back again soon"}
{"text":"I like coming here when I'm craving for Chinese and am on my boyfriend's side of town. The place is nice and I like their big booths. The servers are pretty nice and quick with things also. I like most of the foods that I've ordered but the house fried rice that my little sister ordered, in my opinion is a waste of money it's nothing special. Other Chinese restaurants make better fried rice so just don't order that. Everything else is fine."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in this place! Spent over $30 on a takeout order and ended up throwing it all in the trash after a few bites! Tasteless and mushy were the only two words that came to mind. Didn't seem like salt was even used, much less any other seasonings."}
{"text":"I loveeeee red bowl. We have been ordering from red bowl for years now. They never disappoint. The staff here are friendly as ever, they know my boyfriend John by his name every time he comes in because he was definitely a regular when he lived closer to the location. I always for the most part order the flour chicken and rice. Not your average flour chicken ,it's drenched in a brown wine sauce that taste oh so divine. I never was very fond of Asian food until I started eating here years ago. One of the best!"}
{"text":"This used to be my preferred chinese food spot, but quality seems to have really diminished. Don't get me wrong, it's still light years better than many places, but it just isn't the same anymore. Kinda like Ladainian Tomlinson.  This location is clean, modern and nicely decorated.  If you haven't been, Red Bowl is a fusion gourmet style asian restaurant. Prices are a couple bucks cheaper than PF Changs but preparation here is a little more traditional.   Since it's fusion, you can get everything from Generals Tso's, to Thai Basil Chicken, to Sushi and even Singaporean noodles.  Red Bowl is still good, it just isn't great anymore. But their $5 lunch specials with tea, now that's greatness."}
{"text":"I can not believe what has happened. We went on 6/23 for a family meal to celebrate my sons birthday. The seating was good but the meal turned way different than before.....  There were 8 of us including two children. We place our orders at the same time. In about 15 minutes my soup was delivered and in another 15 minutes my salad, then it took about 10 minutes for my wife to get hers......we had two kids and they had to get some of my noodles as they were anxious and hungry too.....  Then... about 15 after the above 2 other adults got their plates however one was wrong and had to be corrected..... now about 45 minutes after order placed, the last two adults got their and one child..... by this time most had eaten some to keep from the food getting cold.  Overall bad experience!!  No more!!"}
{"text":"This is a Regional Franchise with locations in North & South Carolina.  This location is just adjacent to the Harris Teeter at Mt Island Lake in North Charlotte. James has been here several times and recommended it.  We each had the Bento Box which is a good deal. For $11.50  you get a salad or spring roll, choice of sushi and then an entree with fried, white or steamed rice.  I had the salad with ginger, crunchy roll sushi, hibachi chicken with fried rice, We also had a pot of Jasmine tea, It was all quite good and the service was very good, Eddy is professional and has an easy manner.  A fair price for a decent meal, it's not exceptional but the food quality is good and the dining room is nice."}
