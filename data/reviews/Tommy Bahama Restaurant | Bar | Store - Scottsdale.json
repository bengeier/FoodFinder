{"text":"Of course the food and drinks were perfect like always! Cocktails are a must and you can't go wrong with any one (especially their Mai Tai). We always do a full meal of appetizer, entree (the snapper, steak salad, or fish tacos are my favorites) and dessert when we go because everything is just so good! Hands down my favorite restaurant in the Scottsdale area; you just can't pass up a beach paradise atmosphere in the desert."}
{"text":"The butterscotch on the dessert menu is perfect. Even James Bond thinks so."}
{"text":"While shopping at Kierland Commons, we decided to have lunch at TBR&B. The waiter was most accommodating and helpful but my entre came out lukewarm to cold from the kitchen. Most likely it sat waiting to be taking out too long. Certainly the restaurant can do better than that. Eventually the manager came by the table and offered to redo my selection but by then all the other people in my party were practically finished. She had with her the boxed sandwich I had ordered and gave us a card for a free desert. Now I still have a cold unwanted sandwich. No lunch, the manager should have taken the item off my bill and disposed of the sandwich as she saw fit."}
{"text":"the best fish tacos EVER!  and you really must try the pina colada cake (and I don't ever get dessert)!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant for a while now and finally made it out for Arizona Restaurant Week. Unfortunately I did not have a good experience. The waiter my partner and I had was so unattentive. After we were seated we had to specifically ask for the restaurant week menus since they weren't provided to us to make sure we were only charged the special price for Restaurant Week. Not once throughout our entire meal did our waiter come by to refill our drinks and we were never offered a bread basket that all of our surrounding tables were provided by other waiters. It took forever to get our food while parties that were seated after us were receiving their meals before us. We both ordered the pina colada cake dessert it took over twenty minutes for us to receive our cake slices. Food was okay, service was horrible."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for a late dinner. We were greeted professionally and waited on with a smile. However, I was not impressed with the food at all. My mother-in-law enjoys this place for lunch and I think her taste is usually spot on, but dinner was disappointing. Dishes were more sweet than savory and were just average; nothing I would go back for. Also, considering there were only a few other tables in the restaurant at the time, our food was served warm and not hot, felt like it may have been \"up\" for a few minutes before served. I also not a big fan of the decor, felt a little too tropical vacation rental to me."}
{"text":"This review is solely for their bar.  I love fruity, tropical cocktails and Tommy Bahama's never fail to disappoint. Whenever I come here I feel like I am on vacation. They have an awesome Happy Hour--half priced cocktails. The happy hour appetizers that I had were the tacos, coconut shrimps and the 3 dips. All were yummy."}
{"text":"Their happy hour menu is very good. However the service at the bar sucks! A little better service sitting in the dining area in the bar."}
{"text":"It has been a couple of years since I have eaten at Tommy Bahama's and it will be many more before I return. My party and I had a very disappointing experience dining at this restaurant.   Five of us had dinner and drinks, beginning our evening during happy hour enjoying cocktails and appetizers.  After four alcoholic beverages and several food items each over a period of four and a half hours, we were told by our server that we could not order another drink until each of us ordered an entree.  We were quite surprised by this information and asked the server about it.  She said it was a city of Scottsdale law that clientele must order an entree to be served more than four drinks.  We were certainly not aware of any such statute and have been dining in Scottsdale for many years.  After questioning this, she said that all Scottsdale restaurants had this policy (which they do not) and we would have to order an entree if we wanted another drink.  We politely asked why several appetizers and other food items over a timespan of several hours was not sufficient for a food to alcohol ratio and why she insisted that we order an additional entree for each of us. This made absolutely no sense.  We were a quiet group, spending quite a large sum of money, in a restaurant with several empty tables, and felt that it was ridiculous to blame the policy on Scottsdale law.  After talking to the manager and receiving no salient explanation, we asked for the bill and left. On the way out, the manager offered one of us a coupon for a free appetizer with the purchase of an entree upon a return visit.  Are you kidding me? With a bill in the hundreds of dollars and a ridiculous policy based on a fictitious law just to get us to or order more expensive food items,  does he really think we would return to Tommy Bahama's?  Absolutely not!  May I add that on top of this unacceptable turn of events, the alcoholic beverages were overly sweet, light on alcohol and heavy on fruity juice mixers.  The goat cheese appetizer was so tiny that we had to order multiples.  The appetizer duo of guacamole and cheese dip came with some sort of \"cheese\" concoction that tasted like granular tofu, dyed orange with a grainy texture and bland flavor.  The pork was dry, the coconut shrimp small and lacking flavor, and scallops rubbery. Other food items were a disappointment as well, either lacking in flavor or portion size.  Overall, it was an expensive and very disappointing evening.  And shame on Tommy Bahama's manager and server training to try to get more entree orders based on a trumped up phony Scottsdale law.  There are plenty of other excellent restaurants to enjoy in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Thank you Austin!  Great food recommendations!  We will be back!  Hope to see you again - The Thompson Trio Albuq, NM"}
{"text":"The best spot we have found in Scottsdale Kierland area!  The bisque is too die for......the butterscotch dessert is without a doubt the best dessert I can remember ever having....and the sangria is wonderful!!!  Only thing that keeps this from Five Star is the cost.  Pretty pricey place."}
{"text":"I would give this a 5 Star rating. We hit it during restaurant week and had the coconut shrimp, fish and chicken dishes, and the tri-dessert was to die for.  Atmosphere was friendly and comfortable.  Certainly a good meal with a few tasty cocktails.  Will be back to check out their Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Derek was amazing!  He made our first experience one to remember!  Great food and service - we will definitely be returning!!!"}
{"text":"After a 1 star review on 12/8.I was contacted by the west coast regional manager who apologizes for our previous experience and asked us to try their Restaurant again.We returned on 12/12.The dinner was a 100% turnaround.We were waited on promptly and Bruce took great care of us and was very professional.The food was excellent( try the scallop sliders) and we very much enjoyed it.The managers Zane and Dana even stopped to make sure we were being taken care of.All of the other diners appeared to be enjoying the meals as well.This is a resturant that showed concern with a poor experience and was able to turn things around on our next trip  Thank you."}
{"text":"All I can say is that I attempted to go there for lunch and waited close to 15 minutes at my table without anyone even approaching my table to greet me, bring  water, take a drink order or anything.   The restaurant was not over crowded.  The other tables around me appeared to be well taken care of with drinks and food.  What appeared to be a manager checked on tables around me   To make sure they were taken care of and then proceeded to walk past my table without  uttering a word to ask the bartenders how they were doing.   Very insulting!  I then got up from my table and informed the same manager what has occurred....she was clueless....I ended up walking out without eating.  It's a shame as earlier in the week I mentioned to my husband that I can't wait to go to this restaurant as I have had great experiences at other TB restaurants across the country.  We are in the process of relocating to the area....Good thing there are plenty of other restaurants to enjoy as I won't be coming back to this one.  I would rate this a minus -10 if able.  Don't waste your time here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in there on a lovely Saturday afternoon.  I must say that the service was FANTASTIC!!!!  We didnt even get seated and our server came by and ask us what we wanted to drink.  We asked her to recommend a drink and she recommended the Classic Mojito.  It was so refreshing and delicious.  We had the Ahi Tuna Tacos which were amazing!!!!  Just want to say thank you to everybody at Tommy Bahama for making our Saturday afternoon very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Four of us came here Saturday late afternoon to enjoy the downstairs patio and the steel drums. We had a great time and the weather was fantastic. Our server, Ben, took great care of us. This was my second time visiting Tommy Bahamas. On a previous visit I had a cocktail (Grapefruit basil which was fantastic!) and dinner upstairs which is also a very cool bar and the dinner was great. A lot of seafood dishes on their menu which I LOVE.  Dining upstairs is a totally different experience than downstairs and I highly recommend trying both! It is fun to mix it up!  On this particular visit I was in a vodka mood so I just stuck with vodka/cranberry with lots of lime.(so much for mixing it up-ha) :) Our table decided to do appetizers and dessert as opposed to a full dinner which was perfect. We had a couple of orders of the Ahi poke which was wonderful, the pork quesadillas, (not my fave..the sauce was sticky/syrupy), and the lollipop jerk chicken which had an awesome kick and was super delicious. It was definitely super spicy but in a flavorful non obnoxious way.  Ok now to review my favorite dessert maybe EVER! I tried the pineapple creme brulee..I am a total creme brulee girl...not as much a pineapple girl but it just looked really cool and sounded good. I was not disappointed. The creme brulee was creamy deliciousness and the pineapple was light and not overpowering at all...so yeah!   I love a nice patio as it always makes me feel like I am on vacation and Tommy Bahama's patio fit the bill."}
{"text":"My husband and I were vacationing at the Westin Kierland and looking for a place to eat, based on the reviews we decided to try Tommy's. The food was excellent! The goat cheese appetizer was amazing. My husband had the Mahi Mahi with spinach instead of the quinoa. He said is was good but a little dry. I had the macadamia nut encrusted snapper which was fantastic!! My husband who isn't typically a rice lover finished off my almond rice. We ended the night with the delicious butterscotch pudding. Overall an excellent meal. Would certainly go back."}
{"text":"I went to the Tommy Bahama's store in Kierland Commons and was excited to find out they also had a restaurant. My wife and I decided to give it a try and were very happy with the meal. The drink menu had an awesome selection of rums from around the Caribbean and the seafood we had for appetizers and the main course was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for happy hour.  Good apps and drinks!"}
{"text":"Reliable and good is the word that comes to mind. Always reliably good. Good (and large) Margaritas and martinis; reliably very tasty food (the ribs are great, and so are the chicken dishes) and servers are very knowledgeable and well trained. The only negative if it is one at all is that the menu could be updated more often. I have been going to tommy bahama for years and the menu is pretty much the same it always has been. But that also means they still have my favorites there."}
{"text":"We live very close to this Tommy's and head there at least once per month.  The downstairs patio and upstairs dining areas provide a great vibe.  Upstairs gives you a cool view of the sky and allows fresh air to flow through the restaraunt.  Downstairs they typically have steel drums playing or a one man band providing cool music.    Happy hour is a great time to come because they have drinks and food on special that allows you to try some of their food if you have never or branch out and try a different cocktail.  The staff has always been friendly and the food has never missed.    Recommend...  - Blackened Fish Tacos - Grapefruit Basil Martini - Lump Crab Salad - Lobster Bisque"}
{"text":"First, it's easy to find parking, something that's hard to say about most restaurants in Scottsdale.  You can park on the street (a little harder to find but very convenient), or park in the ample parking behind the restaurant.  If you like an island feel, this place has it along with calming island music.  If you can't get to the islands, you'll still feel like you're there at Tommy Bahama's.  The food is fantastic and the service was some of the best I've ever had.  I had the sea bass.  It was flaky, moist and delicious.  My wife had the filet mignon which was equally delicious.  She had ordered medium well but it came out medium rare which the waitress quickly corrected.  After dinner you can stroll through some of the many stores in the Kierland Shopping Center.  Very relaxing."}
{"text":"Service was great! I wish I remembered his name, but he was very helpful and attentive.  We were there during the 4th of July and he went out of his way to give us info on where the fireworks were. Food was good but I  was a little disappointed by the portion.  I had the sea bass and it was sooooo small!  Maybe about 2 oz for $35!   The sangria was delish... Atmosphere was nice and relaxing. I would go back and try again."}
{"text":"Great for lunch, dinner and HAPPY HOUR! Make sure to go hungry.   The fish tacos and crab cakes are amazing. Haven't ordered anything that we didn't like.   Highly recommend the happy hour. Great drinks and food.  AND the malted chocolate pie is delicious!!! As our waitress suggested -- if you have any leftover it's great for breakfast too :)"}
{"text":"Best ever Carribean Food in city . Whether it's ur B'day or anniversary it's a perfect place for a romantic dinner n spend some quiet time with I Ur loved one. One my Fav place. Try their pineapple Brûlée in desert which is delicious. In appetizer I love chicken lollipop N coconut shrimp.Lovely place with lovely atmosphere"}
{"text":"Mmmm...!!! Loved the location, loved the staff, loved the tropical feel and nice big comfy booths to sit and relax in whilst chowing down amazingly good eats, and talk about good eats! Oh, there are great things to be had here at Tommy's. For starters, their World Famous Coconut Shrimp! YUM!! And their Loki-Loki Tuna Poke is stunning -- what a fabulous presentation! They have a wonderful Sea Bass with an incredibly tasty olive and walnut sauce drizzled over it -- so delish, and the Garlic Smashed Potatoes (OMG), even my 13 year old picky as picky about food in general son ate these like they were going out of style, no questions ask. But the ribs, oh my goodness, the ribs. (shaking my head out of delirium) are perfect and made with a blackberry brandy barbecue sauce. TO DIE FOR. The meat was so tender and literally falling off the bones. You must try the ribs. But don't walk away without having had dessert -- just buck up and find room for it because they have this brownie concoction with coconut that is just sick (I mean sick in a good way, of course), and it is covered with chocolate and caramel sauces, topped with vanilla ice cream. Holy Moly... You know, they have a Tommy's in Maui too, we ate there while on vacation a few times because it's so good and because it's much cheaper than hotel food, and come on, way better in taste! So, if you're ever in Maui, check out the Tommy's there.  For a chain restaurant, they really don't come better than this."}
{"text":"Every time we come the food is amazing and the service is exceptional! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love this place !!  When there are so many choices in the area hands-down Tommy Bahamas is the best.  The fish tacos are outstanding the tuna is superb and everybody is so friendly and helpful!!  It's the greatest place in town  I would definitely recommend you go check out Carl, Tony and Jack's special hospitality"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience this past weekend! The service was superb. Very attentive and knowledgeable waitress (Alyssa) and the manager (Chad) was accommodating and very friendly. The food was outstanding. The Coconut Cloud martini is to die for! We are going back tomorrow night and taking friends!  Highly recommend this restaurant !"}
{"text":"I had ignored Tommy Bahamas for the longest time since I wasnt sure how a company sells food and clothes, its like \" pick a side!\" . I was pleasantly surprised this week when i visited for AZ Restaurant week. Firstly, restuarant week was a great deal because you get to try a three course meal for $30. Secondly, all the choices were very good. I had the lobster bisque for appetiser, the snapper for entree and pina colada for dessert and all three were spot on.  The ambience was very good, though seems to cater to an older crowd. Regular prices are on the steep side but not out of pattern for the Kierland area. Service was very good. I wil be back. As for buying the clothes.....um....Let's just say \" I picked a side\". :)"}
{"text":"Go for the cocktails!! My friend and I sat on the patio and each tried three different cocktails on the menu. The bartender was easy going and friendly. She made some great drinks. I love the mojito especially. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today and Shane was our server. It was a busy beautiful sunny day on the patio but he was always available to meet all of our needs. Drank a fantastic pineapple mojito, enjoyed the crab cakes and steak salad. All were absolutely fantastic and would recommend them! The bread with the cinnamon/honey butter is definitely my guilty pleasure. The reason why I couldn't give them 5 stars today is because we split the large proportionate steak salad and they had us separate the food ourselves on the small 2 top table."}
{"text":"They do this cucumber melon vodka drink that is super refreshing and the perfect cool down needed on a hot day. I like all their vegetarian options. I've yet to try a dish I didn't like. My fav is the fried green tomatoes. They always accommodate us no matter what size our party."}
{"text":"Monday 1/2 price bottle wine, very good selection.  For me the best place in this area on a Monday"}
{"text":"Didn't know Tommy Bahama did food. We were walking around in the shopping district, and my in laws suggested we go there to eat. It was amazing! My mother in law and I had salads (which we took home due to them being so large) and husband/father in law had the fish tacos! Paired with some of their freshly made lemonade (so good). Even though they were going through a Reno, it was very clean, fast, and staff was very friendly. You also got an AMAZING sunset view to watch the sun dip behind the palm trees. Very close walk from our Westin boarding. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a nice relaxing spot to grab dinner that could offer both an intimate feel as well as fun and not uptight.  Tommy Bahamas nailed it for the atmosphere it provided on that.  Steel drum music and an island feel was perfect.  So that was a great start.  For drinks they have a great selection of rum cocktails as well as non-alcoholic drinks.  We got there an hour before our reservation so we grabbed a table in the bar area to enjoy some of those.  I recommend the Kraken Up for a good cocktail.  My wife doesn't drink alcohol so she enjoyed a few of the other tropical non alcoholic drinks.  We got our table a bit ahead of time which was nice and were greeted by our server Bryan who was on top of things providing great service the entire time.  He suggested some dishes and we started with the Ahi Tuna Tacos and the Ahi Poke Napoleon appetizers.  They were 2 things that looked great on the menu (we wanted fresh, light dishes) and so I was really hoping they would live up to what we wanted.  We're both from NY and I worked in the restaurant industry for years and ran a bar, restaurant and catering company in NY so when it comes to good food we know what it should be like and we expect a higher end restaurant to be able to produce this!  (We do not expect great Italian food from Olive Garden as a contrast.)  For us, since moving to AZ, finding restaurants that wowed us has been like finding a needle in the haystack!  The apps arrived in great time and they were awesome!  Fresh, flavorful perfect portion sizes and done with great presentation!  For the entrees we both went with Hawaiian Style Miso Marinated Black Cod.  Again they nailed it with this dish!  Good portion sizes and great flavors!  By this time word had gotten around that we were celebrating a special occasion and the GM of the restaurant, Chad, made a point to stop and spend some time talking with us to make sure we were happy with everything.  He sent over some complimentary champagne with strawberries which of course was a very nice gesture.    For dessert we were treated to another light but good sized piece of Pina Colada Cake.  If you go there save room for this!  It was awesome!    In the end, I obviously would highly recommend heading in here if you want a fun night out, a nice date spot that isn't boring and stuffy or just some really great food with great service that isn't overpriced.  We will 100% be going back in the near future when my business partners come to town!"}
{"text":"For the price, Tommy Bahama's is not overly special in my opinion.  I've been here a couple of times and while there are some yummy offerings to be sure, specifically the Sea Bass, the Ribs, & the Beet Salad, but for the high price point, I would suggest trying elsewhere.  One of the best things is the live music, very relaxing and it fits the decor & atmosphere perfectly.  Props to the musician(s)."}
{"text":"I loved the food, the service and the great atmosphere.  However, I also wanted to mention the personal treatment I received.  Approximately 24 hrs. after eating there I realized I had foolishly lost my credit card.  I called the restaurant to see if I had possibly left it there.  I spoke with the Manager Timothy Carlos who told me that they had found the card and secured it in their safe.  Their concern for the customer saved my vacation."}
{"text":"The shrimp appetizers are to die for.....even with my little bit of shrimp allergy that gives me lips like I just had some bad lip injection job....I still take my Benadryl and go to town on this dish!!!! Love the atmosphere. The family goes here all the time....and from my hubby's grandparents all the way down to the 8 year old, we all love this place. Food is great (sometimes inconsistent), service has been unanimously be fantastic, and they store is generally accommodating..... I recall once, we started with just the two of us and had  people keep joining us and our party got as large as 12 people, and never once did the servers seem inconvenienced....they just moved us around to fit us alll!!! The desserts are great, and drinks even better.....I find the entree options to be too big for me, and usually opt out with 2-3 appetizers, and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Escape to a tropical oasis! Food is always great! Service and staff are excellent!"}
{"text":"This 5 start review belongs to the absolutely fantastic bar at Tommy Bahama staffed tonight by the fabulous bartender Carl with a C. Happy hour here is like a mini vacation. Love the drinks, and the appetizers. What really made our night was Carl and his delectable tropical drinks. Another wonderful night at Tommy Bahama, I already can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!! It was our first time and our waitress treated us to a complimentary goat cheese flatbread appetizer. It was incredible!!! The goat cheese was macadamia nut encrusted-could've eaten tons of the stuff! The blue cheese burger was awesome and the pork quesadilla was great. We also tried the crab bisque and the chicken tortilla soup. Both were great, but you have to get the bisque. You can taste the sherry and there are huge chunks of crab in it! The shrimp tacos appetizer is also great- big enough to eat as a meal. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I came here 10 years ago and remember an amazing patio and wonderful tropical drinks. This time, when I brought my book club here, they would not let me make reservations for the patio, and we found ourselves facing a two hour wait. They were not accommodating at all. We ended up squeezing onto some couches in the waiting area. No one ordered food; too uncomfortable. So had some drinks. They were pretty good. So my rating would have been higher 10 years ago!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was surprisingly really good! The macadamia nut encrusted snapper is amazing. You will be surprised"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday. We sat inside upstairs. The atmosphere is loud but extremely comfortable.  Our waitress Adrian was great. However the Crab Cake Benedict came with overcooked with solid yokes. The sevond time around they came completely raw. The third came with uncooked eggs and broken hollandaise like on the same plate like they ran it through the kitchen and brought it back with a little more sauce.  The manager refused to apologize until the third time at the table when he was propted to. Talking about their last egg girl was great and the new guy isn't. A could have been good afternoon spoiled by bad customer service."}
{"text":"Not recommended...  Decided to take my daughter out for a nice dinner.  We had reservations for 6p and arrived a few minutes early.  After being shown our table, we proceeded to wait 25 minutes without any acknowledgement from any of the servers. There were plenty in the area - just none that decided to come to our table. ;)   I then went up to the host stand to see if they could direct one of the servers to our table. Instead, one of the female managers came by to take our drink and appetizer order.  By this point, my daughter and I had to log into our phones to check-in for our Southwest flight which was scheduled to depart the next evening (those who are familiar with the Southwest Airlines check in process understand the need for timely check in).    As a result of the restaurant's original delay, we had no choice but to check in while our drinks and appetizers were being delivered.  Much to my dissatisfaction, the manager proceeded to then make a snarky comment on how we should move our phones to make room for the food \"as our phones are 'clearly' very important to us\".  IMO, this comment was uncalled for given she had no idea why we were on our phones and after the lack of any service for almost 30 minutes, they had no right or need to pass judgement.   For a relatively pricey restaurant that, on the service, takes pride in providing what should be a positive dining experience, they did everything but. Do yourself a favor and pick a different restaurant at Kierland.  There are plenty of other great options to choose from."}
{"text":"I went here a few months ago for a special occasion. I am not concerned with the age of the other patrons. There was a very mixed crowd.  The food was great and in line with the area, service excellent and Martinis were great, but pricey.  I loved the creme brulee in the pineapple!  My only complaint was the location where we were seated and now I know better. They sat us upstairs in a room with 3 glass walls and no AC ( temperature was about 99 deg outside). There were slow moving palm ceiling fans swooshing the hot air downward. We were first seated next to a west facing window at sunset. The heat radiated to the table. We asked to be moved.  We moved to a table on the other side of the room. There was just no air movement.We got a few laughs watching 3 other couples seated at the hot west tables asking to be moved!  We enjoyed the meal, but did not want to linger in that room."}
{"text":"We had NYE dinner with friends and the food was great! The atmosphere reminded us of Hawaii. The coconut shrimp was the best I've ever had and the filet was perfection. Just be sure to save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Five star happy hour!  If you're going to be near Kierland Commons/Scottsdale quarter between 3-6 this is the place to be.   I can't rave enough about the service. My happy hour buddy and I were waited on by Kimberly. Prior to being seated, Kimberly asked if she could get our drinks started while they wiped down our table... Unm yeah! Crazy Cuban for me and CoCo cloud for my buddy; the alcohol was definitely in the drinks :) The food is top notch as well. For food options we went with the ; fish tacos, poke , and coconut shrimp. For desert, large portion of the pina colada cake and of course the pina colada drink.   It was the best Happy Hour that left walking a little side ways but full!"}
{"text":"A staple restaurant for me! It hurts a little to add a staple restaurant to my list that's a chain, but I am NEVER disappointed. I usually start with a key lime martini or a glass of the Cohn Silver cab followed by coconut shrimp over a bungalow salad paired with soft plantains. Service is consistent and they have a great patio."}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing atmosphere and AMAZING food. If youre in this area and looking for a great experience for yourself and your taste buds, tommy bahamas is the place! A simple chicken sandwich was heaven on earth with lime hinted sauces and spicy undertones. Definite must."}
{"text":"Great food ... great place to enjoy dinner with a large group after a business meeting or a conference ... or with your family to cap off a nice vacation at Scottsdale. Definitely expensive ... but plan for that and you will enjoy the experience. Really good wait staff also. Try the scallop sliders for appetizers and key lime pie for dessert!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back soon when the weather is a bit cooler at night to eat outside.  The evening we went there was no wait and quite a few families in the restaurant mixed in with a few silver streakers.  Dress is very casual.  * Mojitos were yummy and pricey and yummy. * Had the artichokes at the Laguna location but Scottsdale did not have them at their location.  It was a sad moment until we moved on and ordered the Chilean bacon wrapped shrimp from the seasonal menu.  They had just the right amount of spice and were delicious.  * Red, white & blue salad was good. * Short ribs were tasty but extremely fatty.  I recommend trimming some of the fat before you serve it.  The veges accompanying this dish were simply amazing:  brussel sprouts with bacon and mashed cauliflower.   * Key lime pie is their signature dessert - we ordered, we ate it, we left FULL."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere; I took my family a few days ago, we ordered steaks and salads, we sat upstairs and the open air seating next to the patio was heavenly. The crab & avocado salad was great, all the steaks were excellent, but to top it all off, the service from our waiter Alex was excellent.  He was very personable and made the whole experience wonderful"}
{"text":"We love coming here for the ambience.  The food is just \"ok.\""}
{"text":"Really nice vibe. The drinks are delicious. They have something for every pallette. The servers made the experience. Very nice and friendly a very positive dinning experience. The environment is worth the visit but the food will make you come back."}
{"text":"Me and a friend went for lunch Sunday afternoon and had a very nice experience.  I have been to this location many times over the years but this was my first time since the remodel was completed.  Let me say the remodel was much needed as the old space was dated looking.  The new look is contemporary and comfortable with increased downstairs patio seating.  We sat downstairs on the patio and although it was a little chilly, the overhead heaters worked great to keep us warm.    I ordered the Ahi Tuna Burger and my friend ordered the Crab Benedict.  Both items came out fairly quickly and both were ample portions....in fact, the Ahi Burger was almost TOO large for consumption but I did manage.  LOL.  FYI, its not really a \"grilled\" Ahi patty.  Its literally chunks of Ahi tuna patted together like a patty with breadcrumbs, onions, and some other spices, then placed on a delicious bun with a garlic aioli sauce.  It was absolutely delicious!  My burger came with a side of fries and my friends benedicts came with a small salad.  Service was good and our waiter was friendly.  After lunch we went into the store and purchased a few items from the help of the very nice young salesman Charlie.    I live in central Phx where there are now plenty of great places to eat and growing, but I love Kierland Commons and have always enjoyed Tommy Bahama.  I'm glad to see the new space and know the food and service is still great!  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Good happy hour appetizers, great mojito, don't sit outside where the birds can land on the structure above you... They eat lotsa fries and well, if it goes in... It's gotta come out... Sit upstairs...crab bisque is good and a kid menu...pricey but overall pretty good."}
{"text":"Best Mai tai in Arizona. The food is great, service is spectacular.  You have to try the roasted artichoke and any of the burgers. Primo place to take the family."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but the key lime pie left was absolutely divine. One would think the slice is too little, but it is a quite rich, so the serving is more than enough.  Also, try their mojito with jalepeno; it has a real nice kick!"}
{"text":"It's actually really good.  I say it's \"actually\" really good because I wasn't expecting much.  It's called \"Tommy Bahama's\" for heaven's sake; it's named after the shorts (and I have no problem judging a restaurant by it's name, or a book by it's cover).  I got snapper, but not the endangered kind (no food-inspired hate mail, please) and it was expertly-prepared.  The fish was cooked just right and flaked apart perfectly, and the seasoning was delicate and delicious.  My mojito was SO GOOD.  Just sweet enough.  The atmosphere was great, too -- I felt like I was on a tropical island, but not in a campy way.  Here's what:  I felt like I was at an upscale resort on a tropical island.   Except for the Tommy Bahama store downstairs.  It does trouble me that you have to walk past racks of shorts and tropical shirts on your way upstairs to an expensive meal.  I feel like it was bad marketing to combine the two.  I'm a little disturbed by the combination to be honest.  But my meal was excellent."}
{"text":"Love their fish tacos!!!!!!!!!! They are out of this world. Also their bread rolls are like none others. We first went to a Tommy Bahama restaurant on the Big Island. Yep fish tacos. We were hooked (no pun intended).  Then we found them in Palm Springs. Now that we have moved to Arizona, we found one in Scottsdale. Yeah!!!!!  The service is great and the remodel is nice.  It's our to go place here in Arizona. Service and food is very consistent. Oh yeah deserts are sooooo delicious. Give them a try"}
{"text":"I can't even believe I actually went to this restaurant.  My feeling was that if the Tommy Bahama clothing and its wearers were any indication of the dining experience, it was going to be unoriginal and in poor taste.  Alas my friend wanted to go there was his birthday lunch so....  Let me be clear that I'm not a food snob at all.  Just last week I enjoyed a lunch of Nachos Bell Grande and a bean and cheese burrito at Taco Bell very, very much.  That was far superior to this lunch at Tommy Bahama.   The decor was comfortable and breezy.  Everything else  - not so much.  1st it's nice that they bring you bread and butter, but a sweetly flavored butter?  Why mess with the pure goodness of butter?  The glass of lemonade I ordered was sickeningly sweet, and I am a notorious for my sweet tooth.  It was undrinkable until I cut it with water.  The coconut shrimp also had an overly sweet sauce.  So much so that we could each only eat 1 of 6 shrimp.  I got the crab bisque which was crazy salty, and in my opinion, contained previously frozen hence rubbery crab meat.    As it was my friend's birthday, they brought him a complimentary dessert.  Very nice. He got the newest one which was some sort of chocolate/caramel-filled cake with oreo crust, chocolate mousse topping, sprinkled with crushed Heath bar.  Sounds good, right?  Vile, absolutely vile.  Overly sweet except for the oreo crust that was saturated in butter.  On an update note - it was not the nasty sweet butter they serve with the bread though.      My final issue was with our young, highly attentive server.  He was very sweet and well-intentioned.  However I feel that every server in the world needs to stop speaking to customers in the collective.  Don't say \"are we enjoying our coconut shrimp?\" or \"are we ready for dessert?\"  Unless I've badly misinterpreted our relationship, \"we\" aren't doing anything together. Just a pet peeve -  I still tipped him 22% and kept my mouth shut about this odd little quirk.    oh and the bill for coconut shrimp appy, quesadilla, cup of crab bisque, lemonade and glass of white wine?  $52.  for lunch.    Tommy Bahama and I just didn't work out at all."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this restraint more than five stars. Although it is expensive it is so worth it.Personally I  the macadamia crusted snapper and the key lime pie. PERFECT"}
{"text":"I took my mom for lunch and loved the atmosphere,.the service was excellent and food very good. I loved the outdoor bar area downstairs and will surely be back for happy hour when the temps cool down"}
{"text":"Best mojitos by far. Like, ever. I love the whole Tommy Bahama thing anyways (food, furniture, clothes, decor, etc). I always feel like I am on vacation there. The drinks are the best. The meals are okay. They have a decent ahi tuna salad. This is how you do it right. Go on a nice spring day, sit outside at the patio bar, go with a pal (I worked in Kierland for awhile, so this was like my after work hang out) order a mojito or margarita, order appetizers like the coconut shrimp or the macadamia nut goat cheese, and get a slice of the best dessert ever created: the pina colada cake. Literally, the best cake in the world. I order a whole one (like $60... YIKES!!!) every year from my moms birthday. You gotta order those in advance! Seriously, it will be my wedding cake."}
{"text":"Actually I question the need for the renovation.  The acoustics are beer hall loud and add the ability to seat large groups...total distraction.  We were surrounded by a group of 16 and 10 respectively.  The hostess contented she was unaware of such a large group scheduled for lunch....hello, the tables were joined and set for a large gathering.  We found this disingenuous.  The food was average, not the great fare of the pre renovation.  Apparently a waste of resources with an inferior outcome.  You must like loud to sit on the second level...."}
{"text":"The food was great! The atmosphere awesome and the service was even better. The manager Chad was super and the waiter Jonathan was great. Great restaurant with a wonderful staff. I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"There are few times in dining life when you instantly connect with a server. It has been that way for more than a year with Andrea at Tommy Bahama in Scottsdale.  Andrea has been providing us outstanding service that keeps us coming back an average of once a week since. Whenever possible we ask for her and you should do the same. Food is great, service even better, and we always feel like we've escaped to some tropical place. Relax and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go for a quick bite and happy hour drinks or for a complete, more relaxing meal experience. It always feels like we are on vacation here even though it's right down the street from home.  The outdoor patio is a great place to sit and relax, and the upstairs bar is also great fun.   The fish tacos are tasty with just a little bit of spice and crispy slaw. The crispy plantains are also good as well as the burger sliders. On the regular menu, the Macadamia Nut Encrusted Snapper is excellent with the wasabi soy butter and the almond rice.   From the drink menu, I recommend the Coconut Cloud, the mojito, or the Crazy Cuban."}
{"text":"if you follow my rants, then you know i am not a big fan of chains of any kind. i rarely spend my money at these establishments, much preferring to give local chefs my hard earned money, and keep the money in the valley. but i have a friend who loves going to tommy bahamas on kierland, so i figured what the heck, i will give it a try. and i was pleasently surprised by the lunch, which i enjoyed. the sour dough bread was fresh and the butter tasty.  i started with a crab bisque, which for a bowl, could have been a bit more generous sized portion. but it was a rich concoction. and very good. there was a miscommunication in the kitchen and another one arrived at my table, which they allowed me to enjoy at no extra charge. for entrees, i had fish tacos, with mahi mahi. the food was fresh, though i prefer a bit more spice. the inside of the taco was rather bland, perhaps blackening it would have helped. but my guest had a delicious arugala salad, with HUGE scallops and shrimp, cooked just right. he said it was his favorite dish there, and i can understand why. our waiter was just starting his new job, and dave did the best he could. i wish him the best. he was nice, polite and gave us space and territory allowing my guest and i to have a conversation without any intrusion. he offered to show us the dessert tray, which i thought was rather pedestrian. the only one which may have tempted me at another time would have been the key lime pie. all in all, i would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great tasting food and service, but they must use preservatives or MSG because everyone in our party of 4 had an upset stomach afterwards even though we all ordered something different.  Next time I will ask about preservatives in the food."}
{"text":"As is our tradition, we have lunch here every time we are in Scottsdale.  Today may have been the best of several visits.  Brandon took excellent care of us. The bartender helped my husband pick out a new rum to taste and came to the table to see how he liked it. Chad, the manager checked in and was most helpful.  In addition to the food being very tasty, the entire experience is one we look forward to.  Thanks."}
{"text":"A terrible experience. One of six entrées delayed by 20 minutes, while others ate luke warm food. A second entrée was inedible. Another 20 minute delay, to replace it. There was zero acknowledgement by management. I would avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went in a few nights ago, and was blown away by the atmosphere of this place. The multi story seating, live entertainment and the fact that the store and restaurant are connected make this place so unique. They were busy but the staff were all very helpful and on point. Our waitress was a tall brunette, I wish I remembered her name. Her menu suggestions were fantastic, her service even better. I had the \"Blackened Fish Tacos\" and probably would have traded my soul for another serving. Absolutely Incredible. I'll be back many times."}
{"text":"was in town for business and came with a group of people because it was across from the Ocean Club, where we like to hang after a day of meetings.  what a mistake.  I ordered a cup of tortilla soup, which was OK, and the Island Cowboy, which was the center filet cut.    The steak looked the part but upon my first bite, I realized all it was missing was a Wilson's Leather price tag as this was the worst steak I've ever had.  I ordered a medium rare and I get a well done steak.  wtf?  how do you make that mistake?  who eats filet well done?  I gotta say that the cocktails are made pretty stiff.  I guess the guests need to be inebriated quite a bit to buy a lame ass shirt for $100...."}
{"text":"this is a review for the restaurant.  my friends and i went here for the kitch value only.  obviously, this place is mostly for the experience factor of going shopping for clothes then ending up eating at a restaurant.  the food was decent though i wouldn't call it stellar by any means.  stick to the specialties and don't venture too far off this place's sweet spots.  i went with the wine and didn't love my wine.  i should have gone with the mixed drinks.  i did have one of those island type of entrees though and was more pleased with that while my buddy  tried something that he wanted to eat BUT was outside the sweet spot of this establishment and he paid the price.  it was not that good.  if you want to get the experience, i think you'd be better off just giving yourself over to the experience.  don't fight the wave, just ride it.  it's an island/boat-drink kind of place so go with it.  order the boats drinks and the island dishes."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch.  The food was all freshly made.  We shared Jerk Tacos and a Cuban Sandwich.  The tacos were just spicy enough, with tender chicken and fresh veggies.  The pork on the Cuban sandwich was wonderfully sweet.  The drinks were top-notch also.   We definitely plan to go back sometime during the week and sample some other offerings."}
{"text":"Always fresh food with a little island twist. Staff is always courteous and on point. The chicken lollipops, macadamia rolled cheese and coconut shrimp are always delicious, but they've been on the menu forever. A little menu revamp wouldn't hurt, but I'm sure that has to come from corporate. This is the time of year to enjoy the patio with the space heaters and live music."}
{"text":"Great place!!  Service, staff, food and drinks were perfect.    I went there on a date and both of us truly enjoyed the evening!   Highly recommend and we will be back soon"}
{"text":"Ate here with my family. I had the fish tacos which were phenomenal. The beer on tap was solo good. This place caught me off guard considering it's connected to the clothing store. Great food! Very pleased :)"}
{"text":"Once again....Superb food and service. Miroslav was outstanding as usual. Will definitely be back and most certainly will be recommending TB to others!"}
{"text":"Three stars for cleanliness and flavorful food. Would never have gone here on our own, but out- of-town friends asked us to meet them here. Even with a reservation, we waited for a table for about 40-45 minutes. Hostess was super nice and did keep us informed though. Once we got a table, we sat with empty drinks and no water for another 20-25 minutes. Manager finally came over and offered free apps which were very yummy. The food was surprisingly, for a chain restaurant, very good. Unfortunately, we had to ask for more water several times and once we paid, the waiter never returned... ever. We asked for more water yet again with a minor refill all around, and were dry again within minutes. Again, crickets on the waiter, and the water front. Not a horrible experience by any means, but come on... If you keep us hydrated, maybe, just maybe, we'll (probably) consider more wine instead of just desperately craving hydration. Thank goodness for great dinner companions; even so, we will not go back here."}
{"text":"If I was a tourist I could get into this but it's just not worth the trouble. The service usually leaves something to be desired and the food - while yummy - takes longer than necessary. It may be because they were busy every time I was there (3x) but my feeling is that they should accommodate the volume with more staff. If you go try the fish tacos. I hear they have good tropical/island themed drinks as well. It's also awkwardly attached to a Tommy Bahama store front. If you're in need of a Hawaiian shirt or khakis  after lunch you're in luck."}
{"text":"We came for HH last week and ordered a lot of food! Coconut shrimp was one of my favorites, the sliders were also delicious. I would also recommend the crab bisque soup. But to make the evening even better was first, the atmosphere, it's so fun and I'd say definitely sit outside if you can! Second, our server Jennifer! What a kind, attentive, woman. She was always smiling and service was fast. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I will say this - if you are in the mood to shop for overpriced Hawaiian shirts at a store while getting terrible service at their restaurant, then this is your place.    I went there with a very large group and the service was terrible.  We sat at the bar for 10 minutes before I asked the guy behind it if I could order a drink.  He actually said, \"Well sometimes\".  The problem was not the wait staff, but the manager.  Don't put your employees in a situation where they are short staffed.  We called ahead of time to advise them of a large group and you just chose not to staff it accordingly.  Also try to teach your employees to smile at least once in their shift.  They looked annoyed that we were bothering them.  I'm sure this is a good place when they are not so busy, but my review is to skip it.  They really don't care if you are there or not."}
{"text":"Chain, chain, chain...somehow we always spend more money here than I would like. That aside, the grilled fish tacos are so good, we come back  each time we go to Kierland Commons. They have consistently good food but lose a star over $/ chain."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the Tommy Bahama restaurants.  They might be a small chain but the do a great job with food quality.  Excellent fish tacos, pork sandwich along with other items I enjoy.  The service can be hit or miss but overall a great experience."}
{"text":"We try to eat here at least once when we are in town because the food and atmosphere don't disappoint. This time our large party was seated with a reservation immediately in a lovely private room. Our server was friendly, professional and had great recommendations. Most of us opted for meat dishes and they all were prepared correctly with appetizing presentation. The drinks were flavorful and festive with orchids, sugar cane, etc. Kids menu has some nice options such as filet with veggies. The desserts are massive but they offer a half portion which is more than enough for one person. Overall, this restaurant still doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite stops in Scottsdale. Great food, a lot of which you won't find on other menus in the area. Wide variety of specialty drinks, including some fun \"zero proof\" drinks for the kids. The pain Chiller is my kids' favorite.  Chicken Lollipops make a great starter or small plate if you're just enjoying some cocktails at the bar. Highly recommend this restaurant, and of course, they have a great store if you enjoy the island style clothing."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in Scottsdale!  Cool place to eat and drink wine and visit with friends.  Every time we go it's busy so we grab a spot in the bar.  The ribs are incredible, meat falls off the bone.  It's like being on vacation.  I did have a small problem with one of the servers, so I asked another waiter to take care of us, and everything was great."}
{"text":"We have been to many locations and always enjoy TB. The drinks are great and so is the ambiance. At this location in Kierland, they were renovating the store and part of the restaurant.  The room is normally open to the balcony.  It was too hot to keep the sliders open.   My wife and I had to yell to be heard over the other patrons.  Way to loud.  The staff seemed new. Our bread order was delayed because (I can't believe the waiter told us this) the other waiter stole his order!  Later while we were eating another waiter stops by with appetizers for a different table.  Opps!  This was the most disappointing time we have had at TB."}
{"text":"Very fun place, especially for al fresco dining.   Good service and food.  A little pricey so couldn't afford to go for lunch daily but certainly every so often. Have always enjoyed the food and they are good with soft drink refills.  Gets a little more \"pick up joint\" at night so I usually stick with lunch.    They have also done some theme dinners where they pair wine and serve a mutli-course chefs choice menu, the one's I've gone to have been outstanding and well worth the price."}
{"text":"New remodel is nice! Fresh new interest in hitting this stop once again!  Great happy hour prices. Ahi mini taco appetizer is nicely presented and ahi was good. Shrimp Mango Noodle Salad with peanut dressing was generous & berry good!! They still serve the filet salad with the potatoes & shiitake mushrooms! They are plating it slightly different but still a crowd pleaser!  Their desserts are always good here!!  Restaurant was a bit warm inside.   Brandon was a very kind server and was very patient! He never complained about our multiple rounds of coffee! Thanks Brandon!!"}
{"text":"Was a regular at this restaurant. No longer! Hostesses are rude and indifferent to seating request etc. greeting area has excessive turnover. Management clearly the problem. Store is complete opposite. They couldn't be more helpful. Too many great choices for dining at Kierland to choose this one. Too bad. Great food but screams indifference  Maui restaurant is excellent and completely different attitude."}
{"text":"AMAZING PLACE!! Love the food. Our server Eddie was so great! He's so attentive and nice and was so good at recommending food. Service was 10/10! I got the grilled chicken sandwich with the fries and it was so delicious. Would recommend, great for lunch! Also if you sit upstairs...there's a view!!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite afternoon outdoor lunch spots. Great ambiance and super attentive staff. The food is amazing from the pulled pork sandwich to the nice selection of fresh salads.  I highly recommend Tommy Bahama"}
{"text":"Easily could have been a 4+ review as the service from Benjamin was outstanding and the food is always good.  Unfortunately the start was a little rough.   We arrived for dinner like one of the blue hairs at 4:30, had to wait about 10 minutes to get a hostess (there was one other couple ahead of us), then we were told \"sorry we don't have any tables available in the dining room.\"   Since there were almost 30 tables available,  I asked are you sure there aren't any tables open.   I was looking at the reservation list so knew the answer before I asked.  By some strange coincidence one was suddenly open.   When we left three were still 15 tables open.   I get the need to honor reservations,  but also know tables are held back. Maybe we didn't have the right look.  Who knows.   Hopefully things will start out better next time..."}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant!! Our service was outstanding, Jeff H was so attentive, friendly, and on top of EVERYTHING!  We started out with the coconut prawns, YES, if you like shrimp, this is a must! To die for! My son and I had the halibut dish with risotto, amazing! My husband had the ribs, fall off the bone, great flavor! My other son had the fish and chips, and my daughter had the salmon! Everything was amazing, and cooked perfect!  We ate outside, atmosphere was perfect! Jeff, even shut the sun shade even more closed, when he saw the sun on us, and we were all arranging ourselves to be in the shade. Very nice touch!  We were all too full from our meals and appetizers, but the desserts going by looked so delicious! Can't wait to try those next time!"}
{"text":"A small taste of the tropics in North Scottsdale.  A lovely place for dinner, happy hour, or a business lunch. Located in the nice outdoor Kierland Mall. The food here is scrumptious and if you are thirsty, I recommend the Mai Tai.  2nd story is awesome. Top notch service too."}
{"text":"LOVE their cocktails. Also the tortilla soup is the best in town. It's a perfect blend of spices. I'll usually stop in with friends when we are shopping and eat at the bar for a quick snack."}
{"text":"Our dining experience at Tommy Bahama last night was wonderful!   Service (5/5)  Our server was exceptional! She was sweet, fun to talk to, and very attentive. Our appetizer took a bit longer than expected to come out and she was apologetic an communicated this to us promptly. She offered helpful recommendations and we thoroughly enjoyed all dishes she recommended   Food (5/5) We truly loved everything we ordered! We started with the coconut shrimp, which is a must have when coming here! We also split the miso glazed salmon, the Thai shrimp and scallops with delicious coconut rice, and the filet mignon salad. All dishes were cooked perfectly. Most entrees range from $18-32 which I believe is fair for the exceptional quality of the food.   Ambiance (5/5)  The restaurant is like an island oasis. The weather was beautiful so we sat outside on the patio. The restaurant is spacious yet cozy and very clean.   I can't wait to visit Tommy Bahama again! I have my eye on the coconut crab cakes for next time...."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch with my office on a beautiful spring day, so we sat outside in their patio area. They were a bit busy considering it was the lunch time rush. The food was so tasty! We had the chips with guacamole and cheese to start with. For lunch I ordered the blackened fish tacos, which were so yummy and very filling. My dish also came  with some plantains that were in this white creamy sauce and OMG it was so scrumptious! I loved that my dish came with its own desert :) The cons was the service! Our server was nice, but so SLOW! We ordered our drinks when we first sat down and it took him about 10 minutes to bring them out. Plus we had to flag him down to remind him about our appetizer we ordered. I'll definitely give this place another try based on their food and great patio, but the service definitely needs to step it up."}
{"text":"Not sure why no one talks about this place, but it's really good and an excellent choice for a nice evening out. Be sure to make a reservation!! There is a happening patio with music which is great if it was cooler, but the dining room upstairs is much cooler. It's a bit loud at 730 with all the chatter, but it didn't bother us at all. We started with the larger appetizer of 2 mini coconut crab cakes and the smaller coconut shrimp (4) and it was fab. If I only had that for dinner, I would've been happy. I ordered the hunger steak and substituted the asparagus with their almond butter rice. Oh em gee! The steak was delicious and I could not stop eating the rice! My husband ordered the fish and chips and it was good, but I think there were better things on the menu. For dessert we opted for the pineapple creme brûlée (it's in a pineapple bottom bowl). It's a crowd pleasure for sure and was able to scoop out chunks of pineapple. I would definitely come back. It doesn't hurt that they have a huge Tommy Bahama store to shop in after with lots of cute stuff!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here 3 times in 10 days.  Nice atmosphere.  Sat down stirs ll 3 Times.  Very nice wait staff.  Filet salad very good. Fish dishes excellent.  Plantains with sauce is unbelievably good.  Good cocktails. Nice wine list."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to grab a drink or two and a bite on the patio this St. Patty's Day with Twyla and Jim and did rather enjoy it. Sampled the Classic Margarita and shared a bit of the Macadamia Crusted Goat Cheese, which consists of a Mango Salsa, Sweet Soy, and Flatbread. Pretty tasty. The Margarita was nice and tasty, not the absolute best I've ever tasted but well worth having a few while enjoying the patio setting; I'll have it again. The ambiance is casual with plenty of seating options, including a nice looking sofa area with adjoining fire wall, which could be ideal on those chillier evenings with friends. Our server was attentive, outgoing and made the experience all the more pleasant. First visit here though I'm a fairly frequent flyer to the Kierland Commons area, so 3 stars for now pending further samplings from Tommy Bahama's.  #vino2ultimate #twylytephotography #vinosquared #vino2"}
{"text":"I used to go for their amazing crab cakes and the sauce that went with them.  They changed the cakes to these skinny little things, still good just not amazing.  Our server was great and knowledgeable, quick and nice.  I love the relaxing atmosphere and they have a nice wine selection.  I will go back, just not for the crab cakes until they switch back ;)"}
{"text":"Delicious food, magical atmosphere, incredible desserts, great management, great waiter! Thank you Tony for your generosity. It was completely over the top and we appreciate the gesture! If I knew how to make heart shaped icons on here, I would do a thousand in a row. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Be sure to arrive before 6pm to take advantage of their awesome \"island time\" menu (aka happy hour), even available on Saturday. Our foursome enjoyed cocktails: grapefruit basil martini, mojito and margaritas. Everyone was happy. There are great apps on the HH menu too -- the ahi tuna poke is great, and my husband liked the fish tacos. My gluten free friend had a hard time, however. She settled on a salad, but the GF entree options were disappointing. Everyone enjoyed his or her meal. Great ambiance!"}
{"text":"Another great meal at Tommy's.  Wonderful greeting from host with the most Helen!  Then waited on by Brooke.  Her suggestions of coconut shrimp and the bean salsa with the plantation chips were both a winner.  This is always a great place but even greater because of Helen & Brooke!"}
{"text":"Julie the Bartender makes the best drinks, she is great. Great personality, awesome Sunday fun day."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Ahi tuna burger was amazing.  My husband, a veggie burger connoisseur, said it was the best veggie burger he ever had (and it wasn't even on the menu).    They serve brunch even though the website does now show that!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Patio is wonderful for brunch, covered with fans and a light mister.  Great blood Mary and prosecco.  Moderate pricing and very good food."}
{"text":"I get excited when a drink arrives and there is an umbrella in it, well it was lunch so I skipped that but saw the same excitement in my son's eyes when his hot dog arrived with an umbrella.  I really enjoy the way this restaurant looks the outside/patio dining make this time of year feel heavenly.  The lunches aren't cheap but high quality for the price.  I had fish tacos that were excellent.  Menu has choices for everyone.  Our waiter Tommy (how could I forget) was great.  Would definitely make a trip back."}
{"text":"Patrick,  I responded to your message 14 days ago, and never got a response. It's very clear that the entire management team there doesn't care about their customers."}
{"text":"We only came for drinks. Creative cocktails. Great service. Friendly staff. We'll be back."}
{"text":"UNDER CONSTRUCTION but they are still trying to serve diners, which is ridiculous. We went in thinking they must have made progress if it says open for business, but they're encouraging you to sit in the middle of one side room with loud construction noise, covered windows, and workmen all around the dining room. It would be like trying to eat in your home in the middle of a kitchen remodel. Insulting to guests. They really should just shut down and reopen. Poor judgement on their part. I really hope it's awesome when they are finished and I can give a four or five star review."}
{"text":"Back to Carl's hydration station. You can never go wrong here. Great food great service and the best drinks. Thanks Carl"}
{"text":"Great place for HH!! Our go to fave place to chill. Live music is always great and service is always excellent!"}
{"text":"Great sea food i loved it! Will be seeing yall again soon! The foods great never hadsuch a pleasent time at a resturant!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here for dinner on a Friday night. We did make a reservation and even though we had to change the time at the last minute they were very accommodating. We both drank Mai Tai's all night and loved our meals. He had the Mahi Special and I had the Salmon. Both were very good, I cant wait to come here again! Bonus....the store is downstairs and I got a dress on sale with an additional discount for dining upstairs. I wish I could remember our servers name...there were 3 people taking care of us.  I would suggest the coconut shrimp as an app!"}
{"text":"My first time here and wow! The hostess Andrea, was phenomenal in making the reservation on the phone and had a wonderful sense of humor.  The waiter, Benjamin, was extremely knowledgeable of the menu, helpful with our selection choices and questions and extremely attentive. Now, the food was just as amazing. Highly recommend the coconut shrimp and the macadamia nut snapper. Absolutely delicious! And don't discount the sides, along with the bread, they too were very tasty. We ordered painkiller beverages and they tasted exactly like the ones I experienced in Grand Cayman, excellent! I cannot say enough about the dining experience except that I wish I had left room to try dessert!"}
{"text":"Gotta love a place that came up with the best team building idea ever!    Yeah.  you know what I'm talking about.  those \"mandatory fun\" things that companies make their employees suffer through to create \"espirit du corps\" and to have pictures of colleagues painting pottery together. freedom falling together, line dancing, anyway- you know what I'm talking about.  So imagine my surprise and delight when this year's corporate team building activity was a drink competition between the various teams as we had to create a new cocktail with the liquors  and mixers provided and then the chef and head bartender would judge the winning concoction!    Talk about fun!  First we're drinking for a couple of hours to try to see what we wanted to make, and then we not only get to taste our teams drink but the other team's drinks as well.  Clearly the best \"mandatory fun\" I've ever participated in.  And then we got to eat some of the specialty items off of the Tommy Bahama menu.  For appetizers- the coconut shrimp and goat cheese skewers were quite good.  for my entree, I had a  pounded chicken served with potatoes that was delicious and for dessert, the pina colada cake was a decadent indulgence.  The decor is beachy, you can buy a Magnum PI shirt on the main floor and many of the drinks come with flowers in them.  But say what you want cuz Tommy Bahama's is okay in my book.  Afterall- they let me concoct my own new drink . . .we named it the Western Sunset.  I'm guessing you'll see it on a menu there soon!"}
{"text":"I always used to forget about this as an option for great seafood in town. But after I went to recently have been back a few times. You can't really go wrong, but the tuna poke napoleon and macadamia snapper are always exceptional."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations. We had a fish sandwich appetizer and jerk pork with mofongo, which was excellent.  The server was really nice and the atmosphere reminded us of being in the carribean .  We commented that it felt like we were backin our honeymoon in st lucia! I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Really good restaurant along with really good food celebrated a birthday and it was a great experience"}
{"text":"Loved food, refreshing cocktails, relaxed setting, will return!"}
{"text":"I have dined here a few times I think initially the delicious Sangria draws me back each time.  Then once I am there I remember how wonderful the food is.  First of all - save room for dessert.  The pina colada cake is out of this world - its is $10 a slice and worth each and every penny - wow.  The last time I was here I had the NY strip - perfectly cooked.  The bread is very good with sweet butter.  The service was great we sat at a long table in the bar area.  Our server was very busy but stayed on top of things."}
{"text":"First time visiting a Tommy Bahama restaurant. This particular location had a lounge downstairs by their clothing store and the main restaurant is on the second floor. They had someone playing live music which was a nice touch. Found the food to be ok but a bit on the pricey side for the quality of the food. Sort of like an upscaled Bahama Breeze which I like a lot."}
{"text":"We loved everything about this place. All our dishes were great, plus the pineapple coconut cake at the end is not to miss. Delicious drinks, great service and location. Fun restaurant vibe."}
{"text":"Three words: Key Lime Pie...As in the best you will ever have. Every entree I have ever had has been good as well. I gave this rating 4 starts only because the service can be off at times. Other than that this is one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley."}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance, delicious drinks and dessert and the staff was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour today. The entire experience was great. Our server Gene was wonderful. Hubby and I shared the sliders, jerk chicken lollipops, & fish tacos. The sliders were the best. My drink was tasteless (classic mojito) so our server took it off the bill. Besides that the place was such a pleasant surprise! Beautiful patio dining, wonderful food, great service!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for my boyfriend's birthday and it was even better than I was hoping for. The drinks and the food were incredible (definitely give the lollipop drumstick appetizers a try). The staff was friendly and we're quick with our food. We will definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"This would be a 4-5 star restaurant if it had better servers.  We were here on a weeknight and it was not especially busy.  It took 10 minutes to be given water, 20 minutes for our drinks and over 30 minutes for bread, which we had asked for twice.  Our waiter, Sean, was polite but clearly disinterested. The food is good, so if you have time on your hands, give it a try."}
{"text":"ALWAYS great service with Miro and yummy food!  We love it here!!!  We love all their dishes.  Our favorites are the Char-grilled Filet Mignon Salad and the Blackened Ahi Tuna Salad.  We also love the Crab Bisque and Ahi Poke Napoleon appetizer.  But everything we've tried here had been delicious, that's why we keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been many times to this place and it can be hit or miss, through no fault of Tommy B's.  This place could be a great scene but it definitely seems to bring in the older crowd...60 plus.  Great patio and the food is good along with exotic drinks.  A bit on the high side on drinks and food so you should know that going in (it's located in Kierland Mall, don't expect cheap)  If you are younger crowd, my take is it's great for a Friday, Saturday, Sunday drink and lunch vibe but not ideal for dinner.  Good place to take your parents."}
{"text":"We haven't been to Tommy Bahamas in a while showed up Saturday night with no reservation but we had luck on our side and they slipped  us in. The appetizers we yummy Scallop sliders and coconut shrimp noteworthy. Our entrees Scallops  & shrimp my Halibut special were just that special.A little Pina Colada cake to end the night delish."}
{"text":"Take me away to Tommy Bahamas! Let's face it, this spot is downright FUN and there's nothing else like it. From its tropical vibe, beach-like getaway décor, open space, and breezy spirit--this place puts you at ease and has phenomenal energy. Their concept is truly different and very special.   Apart from that, the service and food are great. Our waitress was vibrant, pleasant, and helpful. I chose a glass of white wine, which was crisp and refreshing. The cinnamon butter for the bread starter was unique and actually too good (I had to seriously refrain from diving into the whole loaf). I ordered the Lump Blue Crab & Avocado Salad for my entrée, which was light and fresh. Finally, for dessert I devoured the Pina Colada Cake (I highly recommend this-YUM).  Not to mention, their dessert platter is so whimsical and festive.   I greatly enjoy coming here and look forward to my next trip!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended. I went here on a Tuesday night for dinner with my son. The restaurant has great ambience and is very open and inviting. We were shown to our table immediately and our waiter, Eric, was fantastic. He helped us through the menu and made the whole process effortless. He was professional, knowledgeable and yet had a great sense of humor and was attentive. The food was absolutely fabulous. We had four courses and each was more delicious than the previous one. Very elegant presentation, the correct temp and excellent preparation. We expected an above average experience but we were both extremely impressed. Great place, nice surroundings, live entertainment and fabulous food. We will be back again soon. Thank you for a very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Food is great.  Service was very good.  The sangria was fantastic.  The bird poop all over the patio, well, not the best part of the experience.  I suppose we expect more of a place like Tommy Bahama's than to be surrounded by bird crap everywhere!  Eliminate the bird problem and you have a near 5 stars.  Sorry, TB, just being honest."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for a weekend lunch with my Hubby.  The ambiance was really nice and we sat upstairs at the bar.  First things first, I couldn't believe they had the keylime pie martini on their menu!  It's a favorite of mine and I'm always looking to see if it's on the menu...Typically it's not and if the bartender can make it, it's usually not that great...So I was excited to see it on their menu here.  We both ordered the crab bisque which was to die for....It was perfectly prepared.  We were both shocked at how tasty it was!  Their bread is really good too, which comes with their homemade cinnamon butter.  It was really good with just the right amount of sweetness.  I ordered the short rib tacos, which were just ok...They were super fatty so I had to pick around that, but outside of that, it was good and the flavors were there.  We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"We came here in late July to celebrate a friend's birthday. I didn't know there was a restaurant for Tommy Bahamas until she chose to go there for her birthday. She had made reservations, but more people then expected showed up and the waiters were more than happy to add onto the end of our table. Crab cakes and some other appetizers for our table were ordered to share and they came out pretty quick, but service was slow to take our order and bring it out and we were famished by the time the food came out an hour later. We passed the time by chatting with each other and having drinker The slow service and delay may have been due to our large and growing party size, but they were great about splitting the checks into multiple groups at the end and didn't mind us staying late until closing. They did not rush us out and checked in with our group a few times. I had the pork belly fried rice and it was delicious. I brought the leftovers home to have for lunch the next day. We were also up on the second floor and the sunset views from all the windows were really nice. This would be a nice place for a date night or to treat your parents."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for either lunch or dinner. I like the happy hour selection, as the prices are a bit more reasonable. I had the ahi tuna mini tacos  the other day, and it was perfect for a light lunch. My mango ice tea was always filled, the service was wonderful and our server was very aware of my meeting so he allowed us to talk without interruption. You can either eat upstairs inside, or downstairs with the misters and fans. Either way, you will have a great time."}
{"text":"I love the food here. The atmosphere is always so nice. I live for the pina colada cake it makes the drive up worth it. They have a nice happy hour menu which I think is the best way to try some of the best things on the menu. The ahi tuna tacos and the fish tacos are my favorite. I don't mind paying full price for the entrees they are always a good size, very flavorful. They have great drinks at well. My only problem with this place is every time I've been my boyfriend and I always have very strange interactions with the host. Which kind of makes it difficult to convince my boyfriend to drive all the way just have our dinner soiled by the host. Never had a problem with any of the wait staff."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  I have not been here for a while and I have to say this place has definitely improved.  Our server was prompt and upbeat bringing drinks and water right away while also working a very busy room! I ordered the special which was a filet of swordfish with a wonderful buttery bacon dressing and a side of brussel sprouts and arugula with grana padano.  The fish was cooked to perfection with the sauce not overwhelming the nutty tasting white fleshed fish. The arugula salad has the right amount of lemon and vinagrette, with an outstanding parmesan ( which was my addition, by the way.) For dessert the girls had the Pineapple creme brulee, which was devoured within seconds!!  I highly recommend this restaurant and will be returning soon!  Thank you Brandon for the outstanding service and also to Chad who is the manager for being so attentive to our needs throughout the meal!!"}
{"text":"A local merchant down the street earlier that day recommend this restaurant to us. Sooo glad he did! It was so good and relaxing sitting on the sofa sipping delicious drinks, listening to great music and people watching! We had a mai tai and a creamy coconut drink( after returning a delicious but too spicy habanero drink). Then we were brought a delicious hot basket of bread and cinnamon butter (not real sweet). Then, after discussing our tastes with our awesome waiter, we ordered dinner ( the Cuban sandwich , cup of crab bisque, and the coconut shrimp). Plenty of food and scrumptious! And since we weren't at a regular table, we were able to lay back and relax after dinner. I would highly recommend this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, great staff, great food and love the attached Tommy Bahama store where you can buy his clothes too. The bar is wonderful and all the drinks I've tried here were delicious."}
{"text":"Highly recommend to check out their Happy Hour Menu.   Cheese burger slider:  Burger patty was cooked perfect juicy and it has all the goodies. Crispy bacon, tomato, lettuce and dill pickle on top. So yummy!  Fish Taco:  Very generous size for a Happy Hour menu. It was very good.    Coconut shrimp:  It was very disappointing because it was soggy and not crispy at all!!!"}
{"text":"The server upstairs was both beautiful and intelligent;  she helped us find a place to sit after I messed up on our reservations. Our waitress at the bar section (dyed blonde hair that was up in a pony tail) was extremely patient with me as I tried to figure out what to eat. I fell head over heels for my bisque soup!!! Too bad we ordered sandwiches because that was good but pretty standard. I can't wait to go back and try out some real dinners."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. I called to have a bottle champagne set up at the table when we arrived and Scott was so accommodating, I really appreciated it. The halibut special was over the moon and needs to be on the menu permanently!! This comes from very picky eaters I must admit. They made my special evening (asking my friend to be maid of honor at my wedding) a memorable one. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"The most delicious soup I've ever eaten, period.  Tommy Bahama Crab Bisque.  Imagine a stick of butter with crab flavor and a delightful crostini--there it is, the Tommy Bahama Crab Bisque.  So rich, so buttery, so wonderful.  If you like how it sound so far, go get it.  Sometimes you order iced tea at a place and it's all cloudy and gross?  not here.  The iced tea is brewed to such perfection that you can actually see through the glass.  They have a steak salad that is really good and their food is tasty, all around.  But I will tell you that for what it is, it's pricy as hell and to be totally honest the food quality is not commensurate with the price tag.  But it is still worth going, at least once, because it is a great location and they have the best soup known to man."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant using Yelp and was so very happy with it. Fabulous service, great food and nice atmosphere. Food was amazingly good, everything made fresh in the restaurant. Attentive friendly service. Only down side was the atmosphere was a little noisier than expected."}
{"text":"My first time dining at Tommy Bahama. It got off to a ruff start and continued through to the meal. The food was all excellent, but the service was slow and food was coming out slow and sporadic. The server wasn't very personable  and lacked in customer service. We had the manager come over because it was pretty ruff. The managers name was Zack, he made it right with us and because of that and the great food, we will definitely be back. Thanks for turning that bad dinning experience around zack."}
{"text":"It was my first time here even though this place has been around for quite some time. Our boss took us out for lunch today and we decided on this restaurant because the menu seemed perfect for this warm weather.   I ordered the grilled chicken & mango salad, except I ordered mine with shrimp instead of chicken and opted out of the feta cheese. I've been feeding myself chicken and veggies all week so that I can squeeze into my new bikini a little better for our upcoming Mexico trip. It was a very refreshing salad and I would definitely get it again but I would much rather try some of the other items on the menu.   I won't lie - majority of the other customers here are 50+ years old and that is what I imagined before we showed up because that is basically their consumers for the attire they sell. Not that this has anything to do with what the food tastes like but that's the scene you're getting. If you sit outdoors, you can people-watch all the Scottsdale moms and retired people you want. Who else has this much time on a Friday afternoon to wander around the shops and enjoy lunch like this? My coworker and I are just lucky our boss like to go out to eat.  Anyway, I knocked a star off because of service and I just didn't think it was a five star experience. We saw our server when he came to our table to greet us and took our order, after our food came, and when we paid the bill. My boss got one drink refill and it was because his glass sat empty for majority of the time.   I'll be back another time to try more menu items and have a drink. Hopefully then I can give this place five stars."}
{"text":"I always want to like Tommy B's more than I experience.  It's one of those hit or miss places.  Folks rave about the coconut shrimp.  I've had them twice and have been disappointed both times.  The tuna salad was good last time, but the tacos this time were only 3 stars.  I do enjoy the \"virgin\" drink selection."}
{"text":"I only ate during happy hour. Reasonably priced and a couple of key items I would stick to. The sliders are good. So is the goat cheese appetizer. The Tuna Tartar is absolutely amazing. I would just order 10 of these for the table and a couple of cocktails and call it a day. Outdoor seating was cool with misters that keep the AZ heat at bay. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go eat while I'm in Phoenix.  Try the goat cheese appetizer and you will not be dissapointed."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! I have been here a few times with friends or my daughter and her teen friends :-) The last time I went with a group of teenagers and friends.  The bill was well over $100, and the manager said dinner was on them! They wouldn't take my credit card! So awesome, since this was a birthday dinner; what an awesome surprise! And their food is great! Awesome management & staff - great place! Oh & nice clothing downstairs :-)"}
{"text":"Delicious food and I love the atmosphere! Feels like i'm on vacation every time i'm here."}
{"text":"Happy Hour here is happy! Great drinks, my two mai tais were really good. The ahi tuna appetizer is delicious and at happy hour prices it's about 50% better! The steel drum music takes you away to an island the moment you arrive. No peaking TSA searches required!"}
{"text":"Every time we come into town we stop by for Happy Hour. This place has great atmosphere and the food is delish. Today food and drink were no exception. I must say the girls at the hostess station were just ok. There were 2 of them, the dark haired gal was very nice. The blonde, not so much, I said thank you to her several times, no response back. We then just sat at the table for about 5-10 minutes w/no server stopping. This was starting to go down hill fast. Then a very friendly server stopped and asked if we had been helped. We replied no & she stopped what she was doing to take our drink order and introduce herself. This server single handedly changed the whole experience! Thank you Lauren, job well done! Your customer service and happy personality saved our dining experience!"}
{"text":"Dont like to hit corporate eateries when exploring new towns but we were tight on time and we had to choose somewhere for lunch close to our Westin Kierland Hotel.  Tommy Bahama was a pleasant suprise. We loved the airy and bright 2nd flr dining room. Jeff provided warm and effecient service.  The BBQ chicken lollipops were good but would be better if it were white meat   The Bungalow salads were extraordinary. We just lover the honey vinaigrette.   The roasted vegetable entree plate was generous and done perfectly al dente.  My bbq island pull pork was excellent. Could have used a little more sauce and the slaw on it could have been creamier but it was still a great fork and knife sandwich served on a great brioche bun. The jerk spiced dusted yucca fries were a great touch.  Diverse menu and reasonably priced. If in Kierland area of Scottsdale, recommended."}
{"text":"Party of 4 went after the remodel. We were all stunned by the sleek, modern look rather than the relaxing tropical paradise feeling of yesterday. No booths, no dividers, no privacy. Noise level incredible as the waitress had to go to each diner for the order to be heard. Noise level so high you could not hear the person across from you. 2 of the 4 had not such a good meal but dessert of key lime pie outstanding. We have all been many times but this is the last visit. Ambiance simply gone, décor like so many in Scottsdale. I wish they had stayed unique with the tropical and not dropped some of our favorites from the menu."}
{"text":"I need to start by saying the food was great. My Thai shrimp and scallop dish was excellent. My wife loved her chicken and mango salad.  The plantain chips were interesting. Dessert was unneeded but tasty.  The drinks were a little overpriced but interesting and good. The wine list by the glass was a little overpriced but adequate.  The ambiance is terrible. It is very loud, so loud you need to shout across the table to be heard which means the nearby tables are shouting too and so on. The place is under construction which makes it less attractive.  I would not come back without checking on construction progress. It is supposed to be done but isn't yet.  Parking has never been easy at Kierland.  Right now work is being done on sidewalks so a lot of the street parking is not available.  For whatever reason, valet parking is not at this end of Kierland so my mobility challenged wife has serious problems.   It would be wise to ask about that too if you make a reservation. But the food was good and our waitress friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch during a shopping trip to Kierland Commons and it was great.  Our server Brandon suggested the grilled steak salad and blackened fish tacos. My wife reported the salad to be excellent.  It had an actual tenderloin, not a cheaper cut, and was done perfectly medium rare as requested.  I've always found fish tacos to be a mixed bag, sometimes an excellent dish but more often tasteless and disappointing.  I'm happy to say these were in the former category!  Plenty of tender fish and spiced up with a chipotle aioli sauce.  The prices were reasonable too.  Perhaps they feel a tad guilty for selling $160 shirts?  I'm not sure.  Anyway, I digress.  Nice restaurant."}
{"text":"My sister and I went to eat at this location. We had our 9 lb. dog with us. They were very accommodating; the host informed us that we would have no problem bringing our dog as long as we sat in the patio. They had live music playing at the time outdoors which was perfect. We were a bit cold so our wonderful server LuLu and another wonderful young man (I wish I had his name) tried to light the heat lamp next to our table. The lamp next to us was broken so they actually had to move it away to move a new one that works next to us. They checked on us regularly and we didn't feel out of place. Our food taste great! I had the lobster and steak. The only thing is this locations is pricey but you really do get good service so \"you get what you paid for\" but in a good way!"}
{"text":"I went on a quest several years ago to find the best fish tacos, and Tommy Bahamas won hands down!  Love them!!  It's hard to decide what to order since they are so good, and so is the steak salad, and the blackberry brandy barbeque pulled pork sandwich.  Carb bisque chowder never disappoints either.  Save room for their famous pina colada whipped cream cake.  Haven't met anyone that would turn it down.  A perfect way to end a perfect meal!"}
{"text":"I have been here at least 10 times and have never had a bad meal. Food is surprisingly above average. The location is great and the restaurant has a nice relaxing atmosphere for a dressier spot. This is my go to restaurant."}
{"text":"We love the Tommy Bahama stores and restaurants!  We when at home and in neighboring towns and even Hawaii!  Food and service are great!!!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went here not thinking much of it since it is a clothing store first. But we liked the look of the place so why not. We did not have to wait to be seated and were greeted by the waitress right away. I think we were the last table available at the time. Our drinks were brought about three minutes after we ordered and our lunch was in about ten more minutes. We both had soup and a sandwich. Neither was stellar but good enough to think, hey this is not bad. I would go back and give it another try. So our food was good, the service was good and a nice place to sit."}
{"text":"I love bringing my 88 year old Grandma here.  Great food, great service & a shop 2 boot!!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant with excellent food and service. The management staff is excellent and ensure that the food quality is consistently high quality. With a great team of servers it is a place that I enjoy frequenting with large groups and with small social gatherings. Many great easy to love items, like sirloins steak salad- get it well done and the meat quality is high. They make every dish with love and this translates into the food you consume. Thank you for the memories and excellent experience."}
{"text":"We popped in here for dinner the other night after a meeting with our financial advisor and had a delicious meal! We sat at the upstairs bar because it just happened to downpour right before we arrived so everyone took cover!   The bartender was SO nice and attentive. To our surprise, bottles of wine are 50% off on Mondays! WHOO HOO! It was definitely needed after talking finances for 3 hours! We ordered their bottle of Riesling {dry, not sweet} and it was only $17.   We were pretty hangry when we arrived so we quickly ordered their poke appetizer and it was a major winner! I can't forget to mention that they bring you WARM, doughy rolls with cinnamon butter as you sit down. Um, yes please! For dinner, I ordered their chicken sandwich with jerked sauce and crispy onions. They've had this on the menu forever and i'm so glad because it is SO tasty! I get it every time. Their jerked sauce is off of the charts.   Thank you for the amazing meal and service, TB team! We'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Yes, I know this is corporate.  But it is pretty darn good and heaps of fun.  Especially if you are in the courtyard at night!  Food is yummy, deserts are terrific and huge.  Drinks are quite competent as well."}
{"text":"The staff is great and the Pina Colata cake is work the cross valley drive."}
{"text":"My husband and kids came in last weekend, I loved the atmosphere.  I felt like I was on vacation (has an island feel) with the decor and sitting upstairs with the open balcony. My husband has the filet and it was amazing! Melted in our mouths, I had a cheeseburger which is great as well. I gave it a 4 star just for service our waiter was kind of slow it took 10-15 to take just our drink order. But also he was the only waiter for about 8 tables."}
{"text":"I cant believe what I'm reading? People like this place?  The first time I went it was a part there for my girlfriends work. They had layed out a huge assortment of food. Each piece I ate it got worse and worse, it was weird.   For some reason I thought , well it could be because it is made in huge quantity. Almost anywhere has sucky food when catered.   We a few weeks later decided to go there since it was 20 ft from my girlfriends work and after picking her up we were too hungry to wait.    BIG MISTAKE. We got ignored for about 20 Min's, then when I asked some questions on the food or recommends. She looked at me like I told her her mom was fat. She acted soo insulted for no reason it was weird.  Aside from the bizarre waitress who didn't get our food out till our bodies ate our own stomachs(35 mins extra totaling 55 min wait)  The food finally got there and it was soo gross I actually had to send it back.I was too scared to reorder for fear it would be tampered with andI would have to wait longer and it would be just as bad. i had to argue with her for 5 mins saying I just want it off the bill, im sure its normally good but its inedible. Dont worry ill tip you as if I got it still. Jeez, real professional.   My girlfriends food was equally as bad and she was too scared to tell the waitress after my ordeal.   I told her Ill do it.   It shouldn't be this hard I told her we just cant eat any of this and told her this is for you and put a 5 on the table and left.   I should have said this is for you and spit on the table rubbed the 5 on it and left.    PS, your outfits are gay"}
{"text":"What a wonderful dinning experience! Daniel, our waiter was superb! Attentive but not intrusive. The food was over the top. Lump crab soup was rich and flavorful. The Kona rubbed ribeye was the best steak hands down! Don't forget to enjoy the key lime pie. Wine list was varied enough that we could make a nice selection. First time here but we will be back."}
{"text":"I came here for a night out with my husband and we really enjoyed ourselves.  I was a bit disappointed with the patio as I heard it was amazing but I would disagree.  We ate upstairs in a nice booth.  Great food, great service.  Can't really ask for more.  But it is a bit expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"My family and I came here yesterday for a celebration dinner. The atmosphere is relaxed and inviting and they even have pillows in the booths, as if you're lounging in someone's living room (very comfy and fun!) We came around 5 so it wasn't very crowded or loud.  Our waiter was very nice and even made some excellent dish recommendations to my parents which I thought was great! (My dad can be kinda scary so this took some courage on the server's part :P)  I can't recall what my parents had but I had the scottish salmon special and my husband had the seared ahi tuna. We both loved loved our dishes, really well seasoned and great flavor with a yummy vegetable medley. We also tried their lobster bisque which was super rich and full of flavor.   Everything about this place is great EXCEPT the prices are a bit much. I think it was about 30 bucks for each dish so it's on the pricey side but it's pretty fun to go every now and then :)"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed coming to Tommy Bahama.  Ever since I went the first time a bizillion years ago to the Sarasota, FL location.  They are very competent with their meals and their drinks and desserts are out of this world.   I went with a group of 12 women, since we were staying at the Westin for our annual twin mom's weekend away from family.  We had a fantastic server, Alisa.  She was so attentive and kept everyone happy.  All of us were super impressed with her.  I had as usual my coconut shrimp.  I had a taste of one of my friends tortilla soup.  It was very tasty.  Our drinks were so good.  I had the Pineapple Jalapeño Mojito and the Raspberry Mojito.  Both were sensational, I think I liked the pineapple jalapeño a little better.  Not as sweet, but equally strong.  For dessert this time I wanted to try their newest one, the Pineapple Creme Brûlée, I was happy to share it with several friends, since all of their desserts are super rich and delicious but full of calories.  You can feel your hips expanding with every bite.  I stopped at three.  Now I will have to work out a little harder to compensate for all the fun I had this weekend."}
{"text":"Come to Happy Hour early - the word is out that this is GOOD and the tourist come on droves Come early and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. From the minute you walk in, you smell the aroma of the candles...which is like being on a tropical vacation. The fun drinks are sooo good. You feel like you're at the beach! I usually order off the lunch menu, even if I'm there for dinner. The atmosphere is awesome, and it's great to take a stroll around Kierland afterwards. I have never been disappointed here. Make sure you get a good seat...either on the patio or facing outside."}
{"text":"Crusted mahi mahi was very good. Nice happy hour specials as well. Service was good and nice atmosphere/ patio seating."}
{"text":"Open air layout. Bread is good, Shrimp dishes under par, mediocre at best, prices not unreasonable. Waiter Bl--- acts cool but in poor mood and simply unprofessional holding the blade end of a table knife ware and half threw it on the table. My wife was surprised. Just one of those cool stud who feels he is too good for you. This place needs more staff training."}
{"text":"Brunch was amazing!! Shrimp and Grits and Peach Bellinis made my heart skip a beat!! Awesome ambiance and exquisite cuisine! I will return"}
{"text":"Met my boss for dinner. Ordered the fish special. Pecan encrusted Sea Bass. It was OK.   The service was excellent. It was kind of loud and difficult to carry on a conversation.  Love the shirts. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The service is bad we have the ceviche excellent the steak filet mignon was average cool spot I would go back for the ceviche the service was a little slow"}
{"text":"We decided to have an early Mother's Day dinner here and it was a great decision. Atmosphere was relaxed and breezy! You truly feel like you are on vacation somewhere on a tropical island!"}
{"text":"This was our 4th trip to the restaurant and if I would have written this review after the 3rd trip, I would have given it 5 stars.  Needless to say, the food was spectacular as it had been the last 3 times we had been there.  I gave it 3 stars on this review due to the poor service.  We waited at least 10 minutes to have a server come to our table after we were seated with no apologies for the wait and that was after I went back to the hostess stand to ask where our server was.  She had indicated he was at the bar getting drinks....10 minutes!  Really!  Asked our server about the \"Foodie Friday\" special and he did not seem to know what I was talking about but finally the light bulb went on and he said he had to check on it.  Waited a long time for our drinks to come out and another long wait for the food.  I will state again that the food has always been excellent and it was this time as well.  We ordered a slice of their Pina Colada cake to go and that took another 10 minutes.  I had already paid the check and we were just sitting there waiting for the cake to go box to come.  Poor, poor service and top that off with a waiter who seemed to be clueless and lacking in any sense of urgency....not a good combination.  I will go back and will actually ask to speak to the manager on our next visit.  Can't say enough about the quality of the food and that is the reason we will give it another shot."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh seafood.  Try the Scottish Salmon when it's a special.  On the menu the Thai prawns and scallops are excellent.  Desserts are scrumptious."}
{"text":"Happy Hour Review:  After two years, it's time for an update.    We really like the Happy Hour at Tommy Bahama's. It's one of our ole standbys, along with Brio Tuscan Grill.  Tommy Bahama's works hard at that laid back, island feel. Downstairs you have a small bar and patio surrounded in a U-shape by the retail store.  The water misters actually do a great job and you wouldn't know its over 100 degrees outside. Really!  Upstairs they have an additional bar, with the main dinning area, along with some private rooms  AMBIANCE/MOOD: As I mentioned there's a relaxed feel here.  Or, maybe it's their delicious and yummy Mojitos. The crowd is a mixture of all ages.  We had a few teenagers behind us, along with a few out of town'ers.  But it's really hard to categorize the group, except to say that everyone is usually laughing and having a good time.  MENU: I've attached the  two sided HH menu(photo) along with the appetizers from the regular menu.  The food is very good. Some regular menu items can be pricey, like the salads that start at $16.00.  But, almost all of the HH food is $6.00. Our favorites are the Sirloin Sliders(photos) and the Fish Tacos, but everything is good.  SERVICE: We have never had any problems with the service. You have your regular server, but everyone pitches in, and I don't mean when you put your credit card down.  Water glasses are refilled on a timely basis.  Inquiries are made about your food and if you are ready for the next item. Nice.  FOOD: Their Small Plates menu has: Ahi Tuna Poke for $6.00; Fish Tacos for $6.00; Prime Burger Slider for $6.00; Edamane Hummus for $5.00; Crispy Plantains for $5.00; yummy Macadamia Goats Cheese for $5.00; also yummy Jerk Chicken Lolloipops for $5.00 and Candied Spiced Nuts for $5.00.  All delicious.  As for drinks, the Cocktails are $6.00 and include: Mai Tai, Mojito, Sangria, Margarita, and something called a Crazy Cuban and Spiced Hurricane. So you won't go thirsty here.  PRICES: Our most recent bill came to $43.00 including taxes but not gratuities. But, it's usually in the $31.00 to $37.00 ranges with two drinks. This time we shared a salad and there was no upcharge for a second plate.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Tropical atmosphere, clean and well decorated. Connected to the TB Store. Unique choices on the menu, fair prices, fun drinks... Although I decided to stick with the iced tea.  Exactly how I pictured it to be!  Would surely have lunch here again!"}
{"text":"Great place for a happy hour! Relaxing atmosphere on a patio. Drinks are amazing and with the tropical music sounds, you may feel you are on a vacation somewhere.  A must if you are in this area!"}
{"text":"Service was really great! I tried the fish sandwich and it was HUGE. But the sandwich was good and the tarter sauce was particularly good! I did not care for the complimentary bread and cinnamon spice (something like that) butter...just too sweet for a bread with a meal. Other than that, I liked this spot!"}
{"text":"I guess I have been spoiled by my international travels and it is hard to find a special place to go to eat at...This is one of my favorites! The atmosphere is so relaxing, easy and positive that it just makes me feel on vacation every time! The food is always perfect and the servers always professional and attentive.And one more thing...Love the music! The final question is: which way to the beach?  :)"}
{"text":"There is a time when you need to be transported to the Caribbean and when you in scottsdale Tommy Bahama it is!"}
{"text":"Had 6:30 res. Arrived on time. Hostess was les than adroit. Advised 10-15 minute wait. My pet peeve. Couldn't sit outside , must go inside. Outside was for walk ins. Open outside tables. Doh!! Food and beverage was good. Apps are very good. Entrees ok."}
{"text":"I was on a staycation with the hubby hanging out in Scottsdale at the westin when we decided to try out dinner at here. I researched the menu to make sure we could both find a couple options to try. I found the dining after dark promo where you get to select an appetizer, entrees, dessert and 2 Mai Tais for $50. Total bargain for a first time visit and not sure what we were going to end up with.  We selected the poke appetizer and was so impressed with presentation and the freshness was awesome.  Next for entrees where I selected the macadamia nut crusted halibut and the hubby selected the jerk rubbed pork tenderloin. And WOW wow wow!! The halibut melted in my mouth and paired with the almond rice took it to another level. The pork was perfectly cooked and the balance of the rub was amazing.  Desert was eh, just okay. Hubby opted for the key lime pie which was so-so. We should have tried the coconut rum cake instead but was so full from dinner already!  I have to say that the place blew my expectations right out of the water. I would definately take the 45 minute ride out to dinner again! Definately pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"We moved tables due to the sun and the manager gave us the riot act. The restaurant was nearly empty and he told us that we couldn't move tables because he had reservations coming. Also, we are  adults and they put us next to a kid table. Whole thing is a turn off and disrespectful to the client-will not be coming back. Place was also empty upstairs-unbelievable. Food was not memorable."}
{"text":"Excellent steak salad.  The only thing missing  was my blind date that didn't show but there was room and a great atmosphere.   This is the second Tommy Restaurant I have been to and I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour. It must have been a shift change because we had three different waiters. One of them was the bartender who made it very apparent he was going to be too busy to help us. He leveraged the services of his peers, but I watched them walk out of the restaurant because their shift was over! We sat there with no service for 20 mins. I finally had to walk up to the bar for change, flag down another server to get our bill. Poor, poor service."}
{"text":"Friendly service, tasty food, relaxing ambiance.  Great wine list--try the 14 Hands Cab."}
{"text":"Everything I've come to love about Tommy B's was here the other night. Friendly staff, great patio vibe, delicious cocktails, awesome food with generous portions and great deals.   We came in on a Monday and it was half price wine bottle night. Yay! Ordered a Cakebread Chardonnay that I rarely order because it's usually too $$$. I had the filet mignon salad that was cooked perfectly medium rare. The husband had a huge ahi tuna salad that had fantastic Asian flavors.  Our friend ordered the French dip sandwich that quickly disappeared. And we topped it off with a peanut butter cake that's to die for.   With our $50 off coupon I received in the mail the whole thing was a heck of a deal. Sign up for their mailing list, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Nice food and a beautiful place. The service started off very slowly and the hostess didn't seem to know how to sit server's sections in a better way so that our party of five didn't have to wait 10 minutes for someone to walk up and start our meal. After we got things started though, it went well. Wonderful scallops entree and a special striped bass that was not very good. But excellent  drinks and very generous portions."}
{"text":"They really aim for impeccable service here. Nice! Because service can make all the difference in your dining experience. Our waiter was fantastic. He was knowledgable and friendly. And he let us sample several wines until we found the perfect pairing.   I wish he could do something about the flies though. We chose to eat indoors so we could still enjoy the balcony view and manage to escape the bugs and flies outside. It wasn't his fault but we spent the entire night swatting away all the little buggers despite being indoors. Ugh.   Came here for restaurant week and got to taste their jerk pork. It was fantastic! I should let you know that I was dining with my Jamaican girl friend band she attested that it was seasoned just right. She loved it too. Score! Dessert was great too. The rum cake and the key lime pie were both delicious. Yummy!   The restaurant called me the next day to check on how my meal went. Wow! I haven't had a customer service follow-up call in light years. Everything was great.. Except for those darn flies. They were out of control."}
{"text":"Great location! Tasty food and friendly staff.  Blake at the bar was was excellent!  Was helpful with explaining things on the menu and was always smiling! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As far as the atmosphere goes,it was nice. Sat out on the patio which,even though it was pretty hot out, was cool from the mist system.There was a guy playing the steel drums which was very nice also. The food,although good, was way over priced for what you got. The tuna appetizer was mosltly avocado with one small layer of tuna around the top. The jerk chicken entree was a pretty good size but the thai shrimp and scallop entree was disappointing. There were three scallops that were just average in size and three shrimp that were really small. The flavor was good, but for what you paid for it, the scallops and shrimp should have been much larger. Basically you are paying to eat at Tommy Bahama. If you can make it in for Happy Hour, that is the way to go."}
{"text":"Great place to come if you need to feel like you're on a vacation. Great location, excellent service and decor is island stylin'. The food is good and the drinks are even better. I highly recommend the key lime pie martini and coconut creme. They are even like a dessert drink.  Ordered the scallops as an appetizer hoping they were the real winner, but they were just okay. Craving a filet mignon, I ordered as well hoping to have the best lunch and that also was just okay!! The sauce that was lathered on wasn't my favorite.   Tommy Bahama's has a great vibe going, but I would probably come back just for happy hour."}
{"text":"The service was good! However, the food was not. I ordered the roasted prawn papardelle pasta and it was lacking flavor and sauce. The description eludes to a citrus gremolata and parmesan sauce which sounds bright and flavorful so it was disappointing that it was bland and left a strange aftertaste. The fish tacos were a bit oily and loaded with a mayo based sauce that took over and made them pretty unappealing. I have enjoyed lunch here so I'm thinking it's best to stick to the simpler items on the menu. Sandwiches etc...."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. we didnt like the pine apple signature cake since it had too much cream. But I was impressed that the manager came out and brought all the other choices for deserts and explained them individually and said we could pick anything on the desert menu..very professional and friendly staff...very prompt services. i do recommend the place. out door space is nice"}
{"text":"My coworker and I came for dinner tonight and sat on 2nd floor facing out to the street at a nice little bar area. I am NOT high maintenance whatsoever but this was THE worst service I have ever experienced! My soup came out with no spoon. He never came back for 10min. My coworker had grilled artichoke and neither of us were given silverware or napkins! I specifically asked for a different dip with my tuna, and he suggested a different one but the one I didn't like came out on my plate. Then we asked for water.  He came back to ask if we're all set. We said no we need water. We asked for separate checks. We received one check, which was slapped in front of us as we were still eating!!!  Wow - needless to say we are extremely disappointed here..."}
{"text":"Went there for my dad's birthday dinner and we loved it! We sat on the top floor and loved all the windows! Truly felt like we were in a tropical paradise. We tried their coconut shrimp appetizer as well as the BBQ chicken lollipops and loved them! At the time we went they had a cauliflower steak that my sister got since she's vegetarian. One of my sisters loved their salmon. I enjoyed their steak but it wasn't the best I've ever had, so maybe next time I'll try something different."}
{"text":"Ok, so I read a few of the other reviews before writing my own and I feel I have to state the following before continuing to my real review:   Disclaimer: I have never paid for food here. We always hit this place up when my family is in town and I have never seen the bill.   Sometimes the service is slow. When it's bad, it's really really bad. But when it's good, it's top notch.  I love the food here. I love the decor. I have swiped my fair share of the quality match boxes, but I'm sure I'll be swiping more before I'm done.   Limited vegetarian options, but I have always loved whatever I end up getting. The whipped yams are lovely. The drinks have the potential to knock you on your sandy ass. Desserts are big and delicious.   I recommend this place. Just have a snack on the way there."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on Friday night for 1st time.  Everything was amazing.  Food, drinks,  background music and our waiter Derek.  He helped us make some good food and drink choices.  Love the patio.  Cannot say anything negative. Can't wait to come back and try a different menu item."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat (so far) at Kierland. I honestly didn't know Tommy Bahama even had a restaurant, but hey! It's pretty delicious food!   The last two times I've been here I had the Habana Cabana Pork Sandwich (my all time favorite) and the Old San Juan Shrimp and Scallops (in this amazing curry sauce). The price is, quite high. However, you can't beat the beautiful patio seating, friendly service, great drinks and delicious food!"}
{"text":"I  love this store and I  buy nothing but your  clothes. I have not had the greatest luck with the restaurant but today we a a fabulous waitress named Lauren who did a wonderful job. This was one of the best waitresses I have ever had. I will now keep coming back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! There wasn't a single thing our group tried that wasn't delicious in every way. Thoroughly great experience and will recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"This is a great and fun stop for happy hour! Great service and the food is tasty and beautiful. Great people watching and good conversation with a friendly environment."}
{"text":"Never been to a Tommy Bahamas before.  This place was delicious!  The service was great - live music, great drinks, delicious food.  I wish there was one near me in Mission Viejo.  I thought Tommy Bahamas was only a clothing store!  Very cool to find this place while visiting Scottsdale - will definitely keep it on my list of likes when we are in the area again.  Give it a try for sure!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. I've been there several times over the years for lunch & dinner and have NEVER been dissatisfied. My favorite appetizer is the Tuna Poke-all 4 of us shared it and everyone loved it, the goat cheese app is also amazing.  Last night I had the special-Halibut on sun dried tomato risotto. I finished every morsel of this plentiful portion.  The atmosphere here is beautiful inside or out and the staff is always pleasant and happy.  I love happy staff, thanks Arnold.  If you like dessert you'll love this place. All of the choices are as tasty as they are beautiful. Their presentation on all their dishes is phenomenal,  compliments to the kitchen staff!"}
{"text":"This was our first time to TB restaurant.  We had a Sunday afternoon lunch.  The setting is amazing.  Very nice patio.  Great service.  Attentive to every detail.  A fabulous bar with fresh drinks.  We had mojitos.  Fish tacos great.  Crab bisque excellent.  The crispy fish was good, but pedestrian as fish sandwiches can be.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Only came here for after dinner tropical drinks and dessert  Found the ambience to be nice, and we sat on the upstairs patio and were able to enjoy the beautiful weather  To drink I had a key west colada.  It was awesome.  Truly awesome.  The rest of the people in my party enjoyed various mojitos from the drink menu, and no one was disappointed.  We eventually ordered the Butterscotch dessert, and while it was only 1 dessert, it served all six people in my party. The dessert was HUGE and very rich  Very good though.  It was sugarcane and whiskey all whipped together with creme and then topped with chocolate ganache and caramel sauce....  MMMMM.......  So yeah, we had fun!  I would recommend, if only for after dinner drinks and dessert."}
{"text":"Having a long week of meetings in Scottsdale and needed a place close to my hotel for a simple dinner.  Decided to hang out at the bar upstairs and grab a bite.  Dinner began with a key lime martini.  It was delicious with a graham cracker rim.  When it's 111 degrees outside an ice cold martini like this one is heavenly.  What followed was an exceptional bowl of a creamy crab bisque.  I never expected something this good as I can be a food snob at times.  However, the crab bisque here is a solid and undisputed 5 star delight.  For a main course I opted for the avocado crab salad appetizer.  It was huge and clearly qualified as a main course,  Taste/texture were perfect and the dressing was light, crisp.  I was surprised to have something this good.  The bartender whom took care of us was awesome.  The level of service was a solid 5 stars.  When I travel to AZ I am typically in Phoenix.  However, tonight was an exceptional experience that will bring me back to Scottsdale for more of Tommy Bahama's delicious cuisine."}
{"text":"For a concept that could've been hokey, touristy and overdone, Tommy Bahama's Restaurant is the exact opposite: tasteful and fantastically executed.  They really make you feel like you are sitting in an island paradise.  The service is fantastic and the food is even better.    We had a ton of stuff, but the highlights for me were definitely the scallop sliders and the Sanibel chicken.  The sliders were an awesomely unique concoction, with a perfectly seared scallop served on a toasted buttery brioche bun with a chipotle aioli that was the perfect glue for this mini-sandwich, providing a welcome richness and heat that tied the entire thing together.  I could easily eat a meal of four of these.  The sanibel chicken was another killer presentation.  A butterflied chicken breast, breaded with panko and baked to perfection while leaving the meat nice and moist.  They stuffed the breast with just a enough cheese to give you a creamy texture without being overwhelming.  The whole thing is surrounded by a delightful red pepper cream sauce, and served with some haricot verts and TB's chive mashed potatoes.  This meal was awesome.  Go here, and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time the whole experience was fantastic the waiter Jeff was awesome food was great overall in great experience. The crab bisque was One of the best I've ever had. The wine list is very impressive and the prices just a little over market value excellent value at the restaurant as well. Highly recommend this restaurant to any one who wants a great dining experience and great food and drinks. Everything is fresh and house made."}
{"text":"We went here for a special occasion with our kids and it was great because I had the best Pina Colada and Mai Tai. They were strong and went well with our coconut shrimp, ahi poke, filet mignon, fish and chips and fish tacos.   I think anything with guacamole is a star! That's why I ate most of it but it was supposed to be shared. Fresh ahi tuna + creamy guac + chips = happiness.  Good for well behaved kids. Great happy hour, too."}
{"text":"Perfectly fine corporate dining.  The food is good but the feeling that I get is that this place is another impersonal experiment in which profit and focus groups take precedent over a genuine dining experience.   And by the way, your shirts are nothing compared to an original Reyn Spooner."}
{"text":"Great place for excellent food and fun! We've eaten here many times and the food and service is always great."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoyed a delicious dinner at Tommy Bahama on New Years Eve.  The food, drinks, desserts, service - all of it was fantastic.  We were in a large group, and the server was kind enough to split up our bills, which was very helpful after a few glasses of wine!"}
{"text":"It was the first time having dinner at Tommy's, I had experienced many happy hours on the tropical patio (that is under construction now till November). We began on the upstairs outside patio are with nibbles and cocktails! The service by Kimberly was helpful and she had great suggestions off the menu! We then moved indoors for dinner, we had a lovely table with a view by the window!  Our service there was wonderful as well. The meals were beautifully presented but we all were hoping for more from our meals. Mine- the crab salad was fresh but was lacking a Wow flavor impact. Was like a classic wedge salad with crab on top. My fiancé had the fish and Chips- fresh fish but it wasn't properly drained so oil pooled on plate causing sogginess. The fish tacos were enjoyable but our guests stated that they have had others with more impactful flavors. It was a super pleasant date night experience with another couple! The service was on point but the entree game needs to be following suit! We were there the night before the last night the restaurant was open till they reopen in November! I'm eager to see what they do with the outdoor area! Till November!"}
{"text":"Great men's clothier with bad restaurant...Tommy should stick to what he does well.  It's very good for drinks in the bar.  As far as the restaurant it is; an over priced, under serviced tourist trap. The food quality is god but the ambiance and service do not live up to the prices."}
{"text":"Lovely laid back, but nice atmosphere. Surprisingly cheap lunch & happy hour.   When I'm not wanting meat or pasta this is one of my favorite places. Their grilled vegetables main course dish is spectacular.   The grilled artichoke has been a hit or miss before, but as long as your sipping their sangria you won't mind."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic dinner not too long ago and I just had a wonderful brunch with my son and his girlfriend today. The setting is one of the most gorgeous in Scottsdale and both times the food and service were Excellent!!! This is a perfect setting for millennials and boomers-especially if the weather is nice and you can sit outside! As a local I would love to keep this a closely guarded secret (because it wasn't crowded at all) but it was so good I feel they deserved the recognition!"}
{"text":"Kirkland Commons! Love and miss going to that place... Tommy Bahama is a great place to go for happy hour.  A must to try while there: their mojitos... which are out of this world! Appetizers were great to."}
{"text":"Patio, Patio and more patio... This location sits on the west end of the Kierland Commons main drag. The food here is very good and ambiance inviting. My favorite thing to do is sit outside with a nice bowl of Tortilla Soup and enticing glass of wine and soak up that beautiful AZ Sunshine in the spring.  I love the menu as it offers a plethora of items to please any palate and they are also Gluten Sensitive and that is very important for Twyla and I. They are located near the Westin Kierland Resort which is just a short walk; a 1/8th of a mile I would say. So, if you are staying there, come and enjoy some great chow.  They have an upstairs dining area too and all of the staff that I have encountered here were very attentive and personable. The pricing is very reasonable and the crew knows the menu too.  There are a ton of other venues here for shopping (Lucky, Brighton, Pink and more) and the Scottsdale Quarter just to the east with a movie theater, tons-o-dining and more shopping. Pop in and check it out! It is a great place to to kick it!  #Irishcatv2 #Vino2 #Vinosquared #Vino2ultimate #Rebelfoodandwine"}
{"text":"Now here is a way to earn an extra star for excellent customer service in my book! Recently, I was in the mood for a beach vacation and unfortunately, Hawaii was a little too far away so I opted for Tommy Bahamas instead. Second best right? When I sat down, I ordered a nice Bahama Mama Hurricane and jokingly asked for a side of beach to go with it as she was walking away. Moments later, she returned with my drink and a side of beach! Literally...she brought a plate with sand, two shells and an umbrella! Tommy Bahama should give this waitress a raise for having such good customer service skills that she goes out of her way to think of something like creating a makeshift beach for a customer!"}
{"text":"Chimichiri steak with heirloom tomatoes was amazing! The pineapple creme brulee was insane! Delicious cocktails, fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"We met friends af the end of the mid-week lunch crowd on the 2nd level patio on a warm sunny day.  This our first visit and  had the special of the day \"fish tacos\" while the other couple had the fish sandwich.  The \"fish tacos\" are apparently not always available but we found them to be excellent.  We had great service including the manager checking periodically and bringing new drinks as opposed to re-fills."}
{"text":"\"Save Room For Dessert\" is what a sign should say when you walk in. The coconut cake looked delicious, along with the other options but I was too full from my delicious Parmesan crusted chicken and the jerk chicken tacos! The jerk chicken was almost as good as what you will get down in Jamaica.   I also loved the mango ice tea that they kept flowing."}
{"text":"The dining area is noisy and the food is adequate. I would not recommend this as a seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"The one thing I love about this restaurant is the atmosphere. The second you walk in it feels like you're in California, or even on an Island. They sometimes have live music which is always a nice surprise, and the food was incredible.  I had a burger for dinner and a price of chocolate cake for desert, so although I cannot speak on behalf of their more exotic dishes.. I can say that the meal I had was amazing, and I hope to come back soon."}
{"text":"Honestly I wasn't expecting this place to have very good food but I was pleasantly surprised.  The hot bread they served came with a nice honey butter that I think had specks of nutmeg in it.  I loved it.    Ahi Tuna Tacos and a glass of mimosa to start off the day.  For lunch I had a steak salad that was prepared with just the right amount of dressing. The shiitake mushrooms were crunchy which made each bite an interesting one.  It was a lovely day and we sat out on the patio.    Bartender took great care of us.  Apparently there was a backup in the kitchen and he seemed to notice before we did.  Now that's what I call attentive."}
{"text":"The macadamia but encrusted goat cheese is to die for!! Salads as well   Leap of faith drink is amazing!! As was our server Brandon!"}
{"text":"I had the fish & chips, my brother had to had the Kona. We both have very upset tummies now. Up all night going to the bathroom. It tasted real good but someone probably did not wash their hands completely."}
{"text":"Enjoy a meal in a very nice environment.  it captures a beach like setting.  The drinks and food are very good.  The only down side is the food prices are a little high for what you get."}
{"text":"The food was adequate, as were the drinks.  It's location in the middle of a clothing store does not endear it to me either.  And to top it off, very pricey for what it was...."}
{"text":"An unexpected gem! We arrived for happy hour and ordered the Macadamia Goat Cheese and Ahi Poke appetizer off the happy hour---which far exceeded my expectations. Seriously, you must try these! For an entree we shared a Cuban Sandwich which may very well be the best sandwich I have had in my life (hands down). We sat at the bar and had a great experience with Tony who was just attentive and friendly enough without getting in the way of our experience. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Coconut shrimp and Mai tais to start in the bar. Great service and everything tasty. Then Jamaican jerk pork tenderloin and a chocolate mouse Oreo dessert that was perfection.   Wonderful experience once again."}
{"text":"Liked this a lot better than I had anticipated! Was afraid there wouldn't be many vegetarian options, but there were a few that sounded fabulous! I went with my family, we sat inside on the upper level and it was cool, we had reservations. I could see a mountain from my seat which I liked.  Our waiter was good, service was a tad slow but just because it was busy! They gave us each a tiny goat cheese bruschetta and it was delicious. Also gave us bread and this butter to put on it that was cinnamon-y and very tasty. For my meal I went for an appetizer and got the apple wild mushroom flatbread. All of the ingredients tasted fresh and it was absolutely delicious. I also got a glass of wine and I don't remember what it was, but I liked it. My sister got a chicken sandwich and it came with these really good huge fries and the sauce they came with was fabulous as well. Everyone loved their food. Only complaint was my sisters basil mint lemonade was almost unbearably sour. We also got a slice of chocolate cake to share for dessert and it was very good, though very rich! This place is pricier than a restaurant is typically go to, but worth it for sure! I'd like to come back."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! I can't say much about this place since I only ordered their $6 dollar mimosa during their happy hour menu. But their service and professionalism is on point. Also, their prices for food is decent during brunch."}
{"text":"I always enjoy this line of restaurants where you can be transported into a relaxing vacation even just for a meal.   Food: 3.5, Atmosphere: 5, Service: 4  Cost to worth it rating: 3   Highlights:  - Atmosphere: islandy calm and relaxing fun. Everything smells like pineapple and coconut. Big bar area upstairs, patio downstairs, as well as open window patio upstairs as well are nice seating options.  - Blackened fish sandwich: white fish cooked well and slightly crispy on the seasoned top. Only thing is I could have used some more spice. I appreciated the soft, slightly sweet grilled bun as well as the pairing with the refreshing cucumber tomato salad.  - Cocktails: huge menu list of fun mixology and tropical items  - Bread: big hat-shaped hunk of soft and warm yeasty goodness  - Desserts: the tray always looks enticing especially the pina colada cake, but I usually don't have room. I do like that they have a half portion option for a smaller taste.   Lowlights:  - Pork sandwich: sauce was way too sweet and I like sweet bbq. The southern hub couldn't even finish it.   Pleasant tropical retreat for a meal and I would return."}
{"text":"Who would have thought Tommy Bahamas was anything but a clothing store?? I've eaten here at least three of four times and despite some of the mixed Yelp reviews, I really like this place.    I recommend going early for drinks at the bar. Ok... I recommend going to the bar almost always regardless of where you go out to eat.  It makes it for a \"good time\" with your friends, especially at Tommy Bahamas due to their topical-tropicana-beach-esk theme they have going on.  They will make you almost any kind of \"fruity ~ tropical\" kind of drink known to mankind.   We sat outside in their patio area under an umbrella. Very enjoyable and a high recommend when you go.   The tropical music they pipe through the air and the Magnum-esque clothing worn by the staff all make for a relaxing atmosphere. We were there on a weekday, and it was pretty empty until the conference crowd showed up just after noon. The food was surprisingly good.  I had the Lemongrass encrusted Ahi, seared rare, sweet chili sauce, cilantro oil, island almond rice, shiitake mushrooms, minus the toasted sesame seeds with baby bok choy.  It was a little pricing at $30 - but very good! The crab bisque was also good. They also offer some Gluten Free dinner and lunch selections as well.  The real surprise here was the service. Our waiter (I wish I remembered his name) was amazing. Very friendly and attentive. for example, I asked for more chili sauce and he brought out both the chili sauce and their spicier chili sauce which he thought I might like better. AWESOME!  Yes this is a \"Touristy\" kind of place and it's over priced, but it is also a good dinning experience to have with your friends and a cool place to shop for that special Magnum-esque attire you've always wanted : -)"}
{"text":"Nice happy hour with half priced bottles of wine...need i say more? Very good bartenderand while I didn't eat it the burger looked good!"}
{"text":"I arrived about 5:45 PM last night, a Saturday night. The upstairs Dinning room was empty, but the rest of the place was packed.  I asked for a table in the upstairs dinning room by the balcony.  I was seated in the middle table facing the views of the mountains and the Kierland shops.  The place gives out that old world charm, wicker chairs and ceiling fans, forged steal veranda, a very cool tropical experience.  I was the first seated in the room, the rest began to trickle as the evening went on.  My waiter was very nice, and friendly and gave very attentive service.  I ordered the Fillet Mignon with broccolini (explained to me as a broccoli/asparagus combination), with mashed broccolini purée. It was simply superb.  The steak was so tender, I could have sliced it with a butter knife, and the Broccolini was amazing.  I did order a salad ahead of the meal that was very tasty, with nuts and feta cheese, also delicious.  I left very happy, since both the vibe and the food were excellent.  It's not cheap, but definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"What a night! Had a wonderful dinner, excellent service provided by Carl M. Mixed up a tasty crazy Cuban and a sweet Mai Tai on a unique birthday night. Staff serenaded our night up stairs. This night man!! What a night. The shrimp. Chops. One in the books  enjoy your taste of the islands my friends :)"}
{"text":"Great upscale casual atmosphere. The food is pretty good but the coconut shrimp appetizer steals the menu. The menu is a little on the pricey side. I highly recommend making a reservation unless you want to wait a while a have a mai tai downstairs. Women please take the elevator if you are wearing high heels and or drinking a bit. I have seen many women trip while climbing the stairs to the upstairs dining area. If you are looking for a change of pace, this is a good choice but plan on allocating at least $120 per couple (with tip)."}
{"text":"We returned to Tommy Bahamas to celebrate my daughter turning 21. We had a great experience the food fabulous and the service was just as good. Looking forward to my next visit. Special thanks to Dana for inviting us back, see you soon.  Post below was from an April Visit when I gave them three stars. I have eaten at this restaurant at least 7 times in the last year.  My daughter took me to our favorite restaurant for my birthday. We were seated promptly and was told our server Summer would be our server and she will be with us shortly. After about 10 minutes Summer showed up and took our drink order I had asked to also put in an appetizer at that time. Summer informed us she would return with water our drinks and bread. Another 10 minutes went by and Summer returned with our beverages but no water and no bread as promised.  Once our appetizer was delivered and consumed Summer informed us that the kitchen is baking bread as we speak. So now we have waited 30 minutes for bread and water. Finally the bread showed up and shortly there after so did our entrees. The food was hot and good. Still no water my beverage was empty while ate my entree.  The service was the down fall of what was a special night as my daughter took me out to dinner to our favorite restaurant. But all of the delays and not bringing items to the table in a reasonable time period ruined the evening.  We were asked if we wanted desert and at that time we were frustrated and refused. A gentleman approached our table and asked how everything was and informed him of our displeasure with the service. Not sure who he was since he did not inform us but I am sure he was the manager. After hearing our reason for displeasure he returned to the table and discounted our check and apologized for the service we received.  The gesture was appreciated and we will return and hope that the service has improved. Our server seemed overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Pretty average place.  Good location, nice decor, good service and average food at above average prices.  Went here for lunch with a friend on Friday. We were seated in the nice dining area upstairs.  We ordered the coconut shrimp appetizer.  Six large shrimp with a sweet dipping sauce was a nice start to the meal.  My friend ordered the fish tacos which he said were good.  I ordered the Cuban sandwich.  Plenty of meat and presented nicely.  Not a fan of the yucca fries.  They were thick cut and not very crispy.  Tasted more like eating a piece of cooked, starchy something similar to potato.  The dipping sauce for the fries must have been made a while ahead of time because when I dipped into it the color inside was lighter than the color on the outside.  The bill before tip but after tax was $53.  I don't mind spending that much for lunch occasionally, but not here."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. My husband and I used to eat here all the time until we relocated to DFW. We eat at the location in Maui every year as well and when we were missing Hawaii, we'd immediately head to Kierland to get our fish taco fix!  The patios are especially lovely during the three months a year when the weather is absolutely perfect! Service has always been friendly and food is always fresh and delicious! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with the food at all.  My husband and I dropped over $90 on food that was mediocre.  Service was horrible, our server never checked on us, and we were sat at a table with no condiments like salt and pepper and no bread basket was given with our soup.  (We paid over $10 each for our soup.). Food wasn't bad, but certainly not worth the inflated price.  Service and food were both extremely slow and disappointing.  Plenty of better restaurants in the area more reasonably priced.  Second experience:    We gave Tommy Bahamas a second try.  So happy we did!  Night and day difference from our first experience.  Our server Jonathan and manager Dre were both very attentive, personable and had great suggestions.    The view was beautiful sitting on the second floor with open windows overlooking the city/mountains.  We ordered the scallop sliders as an appetizer, they were incredible...my only complaint is I wish they had more as they were so tasty!  The kitchen was much more prompt  this time.   The lobster bisque soup was amazing with a spritz of lemon.   I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Sanibel Chicken which came with cauliflower mash and broccolini very tasty, and I will definitely be back to order again.  Both my husband and I throughly enjoyed this dish.  My husband ordered the Ribs which came with a cabbage island slaw and cauliflower chive mash, all very good.   For desert we had the pineapple creme brûlée.  Light , refreshing and definitely would order again.    My husband and I were extremely impressed from start to finish.  From the service, to the kitchen and the food, it was definitely an experience that will bring us back soon and on a more regular basis.  Thank you Jonathan, Patrick and Dre for doing such a stellar job!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience.  Last night's dinner was superb - terrific service from waitress and the manager - food perfectly prepared - will dine here over and over again!"}
{"text":"We came here for restaurant week.  The crab cake was ok.  The signature coconut shrimp was rubbery.  Entrees were the ribs which were ordinary and seared tuna which had zero tuna taste.  Truly the WORSE part of the meal was the \"dessert\".  Again signature coconut cake and chocolate brownie with ice cream.  The Coconut cake was topped with this layer of stale coconut.  It wasn't soft and fluffy or toasted crispy.  IT WAS STALE as it had been sitting in the kitchen exposed to the elements for days!  The chocolate brownie was actually EVEN WORSE.  It was hard as a brick.  They could have very well been serving us those fake desserts many restaurants bring over at the end of the meal to show what they offer.  Save your money and go ANYWHERE else."}
{"text":"The blue crab avocado salad is to die for! A lot of healthy choices in the menu. A little on the pricey side but worth it. Ask for bread and butter!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with the fish entree's. Pricey and just not that flavorful. The bread is tasteless like I imagine cardboard would be. I've dined here a few too many times.   The waiter I had twice was just ok and for the price of my lunch $27. no drink or dessert I'd like him to fawn over me and my guest.  The HH is a good deal and I liked the fish tacos.   We've sat upstairs when the heat was bad out and that was pleasant and outside when there was a slight breeze, ha it's Az what breeze, but it's not even a good spot to people watch."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant and this would absolutely have been a five star review minus a couple of small service blunders on their parts.  This is a 3.5 review if such a thing was possible.  On vacation in Phoenix and celebrating our wedding anniversary, we booked a reservation here on our actual anniversary.  I asked to please have a nice table on their outside veranda for the special occasion.  They were apologetic when we arrived (and gave us the option to wait for one) but had a table that was basically on the edge of inside/outside and we accepted it.  Then we sat there for 10 minutes watching waiters, waitresses and busboys whiz past with drinks and trays of food.  I was getting frustrated and finally made eye contact with a very nice waitress who came over, was sweet and said she would \"take care of us\".  I'm not sure if it was her table or who dropped the ball, but we were lucky to have her, as our service from that point on was quite good.    The food was amazing.  Crab Bisque and Scallop Sliders for apps, Shrimp Pasta and Ahi for entrees.  All prepared beautifully and delicious.  It seems petty to mark them down for this, but I did see desserts with candles coming out for birthdays, and we had been very clear from the reservation, to conversation with our server that this was a special anniversary-- So I was expecting some kind of complimentary dessert.  When we had finished our meals and she showed us the dessert tray, we said we'd discuss it, and she disappeared.  I thought aha, they are bringing us out an anniversary surprise.  Nope, she literally was gone for 10-12 minutes, then came back and asked if we had made a decision.  My wife was done at this point, so I asked for our check and we left.  I sure would have enjoyed a slice of Key Lime or something as a token anniversary gift.  It isn't like we didn't spend $140 for the meal, they could have done something thoughtful at the end.  We stopped for Fro-Yo on the way home, and that worked out just fine."}
{"text":"Carl was the best!! Exceptional service and so friendly and personable!! Food was great but he made it even better :)"}
{"text":"Service was very good. Food was expensive for what it was. Not a great value in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and delicious food. The menu is unique and I've loved everything I've tried. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the north Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ate at Tommy Bahamas with his boss from out of town on Wednesday! This was our first time dining here and I was super excited because I love the way the restaurant looks from the outside. It's beautiful.   Our server was very friendly and nice. She gave us a lot of time to decide what we wanted because we were those people who talk more before ordering our meal. I ordered the sangria which was delicious.   I was contemplating two dishes, a pasta dish with mushrooms and shrimp or crab stuffed shrimp. My server recommended the pasta and she was so right! It was the best pasta dish I ever had out to dinner. My boyfriend had shrimp and scallops and that too was delicious.   I loved the butter with the rolls and I truly enjoyed my evening and meal. I like this place because it is a little pricey but nothing to break the bank. You and a special friend can walk out of there paying less than $100 and get a quality meal.   I recommend this gem to any foodie in AZ! :)"}
{"text":"Thanks to Tommy for taking in two weary travelers and providing much needed sustenance. The Dark and Stormy was particularly enjoyable, followed by an excellent meal."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND   Am I the only one who walks into a super high end business and wonders where all it all came from, who is behind it and what makes it stand out?  So I Googled Tommy Bahama and found out a lot of cool stuff.   Now I know where Tommy Bahama headquarters is, if Tommy Bahama is a real person or not, and whether or not Tommy Bahama stock is publicly traded.  But let's talk about my experience.   THE STORY  The Mai Tai was pretty, but not my favorite. It's definitely for someone who LOVES rum.  The coconut shrimp were delicious. The Ahi Poke Napoleon was good, but the chips were so-so.  The fish tacos were scrumptious.  SERVICE EXPERIENCE  The entire staff was outstanding. Our server, Polly, was very helpful and very fast.   CONCLUSION  The view and environment are stellar.  5/5 HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"Grilled veggies with shrimp was fantastic, and Carl was very attentive and personable. I must come back for happy hour! I love when a restaurant has food AND drink specials. The varied seating options at this location make it special."}
{"text":"Coconut shrimp was really good.    of course they ought to be for $3 per shrimp..... and they were not the big gulf shrimp either.... but they were OK.   nice vibe throughout the restaurant   good location   drinks a little pricey at $12 a crack."}
{"text":"You're in 120 degree Scottsdale weather and you need a casual change of clothes, a bite to eat, and a refreshing adult beverage; Tommy Bahama can do it all under one roof. A retail clothier on the bottom floor and a decent, predictable place to eat and drink upstairs...ok, I'll work with you Tommy. There is nothing special about this place except I found their service in both their retail space and restaurant superb. Try their grilled crab cakes and their twice shaken martini."}
{"text":"Ethan & Ron are amazing!!! If you are in the area you've got to come check out this outside bar area!!!!"}
{"text":"Can we say Overpriced?? The Manager was beyond nice and comforting. Which wasn't a problem if  only the waitresses had the same attitude and  attentiveness as their manager things would have been a little more pleasant in my opinion.  I hate it when they only time they want to ask if someone wants a refill is my boyfriends alcoholic bevareges. It's like geeze people my amazing lemonade has been gone for over 30 minutes and you do not want to ask me if I would like more?! YES I WOULD HAVE. The food was severely minimal for the price. I had ordered the Thai shrimp and scallops with the coconut curry. Not bad. But not good enough for 26 dollars. I wish i had gotten their tiny filet instead.  Just disappointed just like I am sure the rest of our large party was.  It seems like they barely asked anyone at our table besides my boyfriend if they wanted more beverages. Which I really quite sad if you ask me. Because with as little food they give you, you would think people might like a refill on whatever it is that they ordered drink regardless if it had alcohol in it. I mean seriously its my hard to ask that question. Actually it's more polite and expected of a waitress especially with as big of a table bringing in the profit off of gratuity. Probably the reason they felt they didn't have to do much since they are getting tipped anyways so I'm sure they felt they didn't have to work for it. Sad. If I'm ever around the  area I know where not to come for food. An that would be this place."}
{"text":"Great vibe ...  Love the Burger & fries aee delish The upper level deck gives a nice sunset view. Good date spot  guys"}
{"text":"We love the food and atmosphere but we will have to say that we have not been 100% impressed with the service in the past. The outside bartenders have not been very attentive.   Until today---Sean, the bartender was amazing! Very knowledgeable, very friendly, and attentive. We love the roasted vegetables with shrimp. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for some afternoon drinks with the S.O.  We loved the ambiance, the bartender was really cool, and the drinks were spectacular."}
{"text":"Disgusting!!!! The bartending was cold and offended my boyfriend numerous times. To top it off the food was inedible! I used to love this place but I will not be returning"}
{"text":"This place really does have such a relaxed atmosphere. I've been there with both friends and family for their happy hour and it's just such a pleasant experience overall.   Drink-wise I'm absolutely partial to their Sangria but I also love their Crazy Cuban. Their Crazy Cuban is a lovely mix of Mt. Gay Eclipse, Cruzan Coconut, 99 Bananas, and pineapple.  Tommy Bahamas is actually weakest in the food department in my opinion. The fish tacos have gotten the best reviews from my panel but it's a smaller amount of food for a good bit of money.  What really has me writing this review is their desserts...well, one dessert in particular. I love their Piña Colada Cake so much that I haven't been able to try anything else because I can't bring myself to order anything else. It's so tropical and has the flavor of a rich dense cake while still being as light and fluffy as a cloud.  I have my suspicions of how they accomplish this feat, but as far as I know they suse a vanilla cake doused in rum, with layer of a light and fluffy white chocolate mousse with diced pineapple in between. On the outer rim of this cake is a very light application of shaved coconut. Now normally, I'm not a fan of coconut and I would just remove whatever coconut I could from the cake, but on this one it's really a nice compliment.  Overall: food is decent, but the drinks and the ambiance more than make up for it. If you do go and you like tropical flavors, you MUST try the Piña Colada Cake."}
{"text":"My sister and I had lunch here in Scottsdale on her recollection of us enjoying the TB in Orlando so much a few years back... I'd actually been to the Scottsdale location a few times for dinner since that first time in FL so I was totally up for it if she was paying. Another great experience! Long, leisurely lunch on the patio on a beautiful day... The warm bread with cinnamon butter was a great start with crisp mango iced tea. Then we had the Scallop Sliders and they were just as good as the first time; not too spicy and so juicy! Also tried the coconut shrimp--huge shrimp; sweet dipping sauce (might've benefitted from a bit of spice...) Absolutely LOVE the Crab Bisque!  And the Grilled Chicken Salad was much like you find in many other places (with Gorgonzola and Granny Smith Apples and bacon) but the homemade croutons add a satisfying, sweet crunch. And you simply CANNOT leave without trying the Piña Colada Cake! So light, not too sweet...and they offer a half portion so NO excuses. Try it, you must (as Yoda would say...)"}
{"text":"FIrst of the event coordinator Annie is AMAZING.  She is spunky, beautiful, and so nice.  She made me feel so welcome!  The patio at Tommy's is breath taking.  You feel like you are on an island.  The atmosphere is so calm and breezy.    The staff welcomed me as if I was a regular.  I had this amazing steak salad called Saba Steak Salad.  And I had the Island Goat Cheese.  I can barely explain them because I will talk myself into going back there.  The steak in the salad melted in my mouth and was seasoned to perfection!  The dressing had a garlic aioli that added so much flare and flavor.  There were 3 potato coins on the side that were a great addition to the salad.   The spring mix and romaine was fresh and I was very pleased.  Now to the goat cheese.  HOLY COW.  So tasty!!  It wasn't overwhelming is was perfect.  There were tortillas strips on the side that were dangerous because I really wanted a bag of them when I was done.  There was also a mango salsa with the cheese and I will admit I had a spoonful of it on its own.  As you can tell I HIGHLY recommend Tommy Bahamas.  What would be great is everyone bought tickets to the Original Taste this weekend and you can taste 36 restaurants in one event!!!"}
{"text":"Strolled in here during an appetizer crawl through Scottsdale Quarter. We had a couple of drinks plus the macadamia nut encrusted goat cheese. Amazing! There were a few other apps I wanted to try, but you just can't do that all in one night! There was live music of the genre that you would expect to hear at a Tommy Bahama's. The bartenders were attentive, and the patio bar is amazing."}
{"text":"Went today for the first time. The quesadillas were the best I've ever had. My husband had the Cuban sandwich, which of course I tried...it was equally delicious! The atmosphere made me feel like I was back in the Bahamas. And not to forget the staff. We sat at the bar, and the bartenders were wonderful and so nice!"}
{"text":"this was my second visit here and all the food was acceptable and even quite good my entrée was excellent. However there must be some measure of cost for all reviews. Ambience along with good food and this place is still not worth it, just overpriced beyond belief"}
{"text":"Yummy! It was my Friday day in Phoenix and we were staying at the Westin Kierland, so we mozied on over to the shopping center and decided to try the Tommy Bahama Cafe. It was such a cute little place. We started off with the chicken lollipops and those were pretty good. I had the fish tacos and those were delish! There were 3 of them and I gave my boyfriend one b/c there was so much fish and toppings, it was a lot of food! He had the Ahi Tuna Salad and that was very light and refreshing. Since we were staying at the Westin we actually received 10 dollars off our meal, that was a nice little touch. We each had a mojito as well, I had the original and my boyfriend had the pineapple and they were made really well! Not too sweet or sugary. They actually came with a sugar kane in them, which we both enjoyed munching on. I would definitely recommend Tommy Bahama to anyone shopping in Kierland or in the area."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue... I wanted to come to a restaurant I've never been to for happy hour on a Friday afternoon and found this place on Yelp. I tell my husband to meet me here and he's a little confused, \"You want to go to Tommy Bahama, the store?!\" Haha.   We didn't want to sit on the patio since it was a little chilly so we decided to dine in the restaurant which is located upstairs. Our server/bartender was very friendly. I ordered the sangria which was delicious and we started ordering items off of the hh menu: ahi poke, macadamia crushed goat cheese, and sliders. Everything was so good. We were impressed. It helps that you feel like you are dining at a restaurant on an island too. Made us miss Maui.   Anyway, we decided to order desserts: the peanut butter and chocolate pie. Both were rich and sweet, a little too rich and sweet that we had to take them home to indulge in later. Overall, I had a great experience and I highly recommend visiting!"}
{"text":"Cool, open air design of the restaurant is fun. The furnishings are comfortable. The server was attentive but didn't offer much when asked for advice on \"what's good?\"  We enjoyed Mojitos which were tasty. Appetizers of scallop sliders (delicious), guacamole (also delish) and beer cheese dip (avoid).  For entree, I had the shrimp ramen which was pretty good, but the shrimp still had their tails. Rather stupid to have to fish (no pun intended) them out of the soup to remove the tails. Ten extra seconds of prep work is all it would take to fix that so no excuse for them not to.  My date had the pork belly fried rice which was okay but a little dry.  Portions for both dishes were more than we could finish, although my date lost interest in the rice.  Spending close to $100 for lunch, I would expect higher quality food and better trained wait staff."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a Sunday, ordered a Mimosa and Crab Cakes. Both were very good. The service was excellent, the waiter was very attentive. I would definitely recommend for a nice Sunday afternoon brunch place. They were fairly busy when I went as well, but still received excellent & quick service and delicious food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love it here! My boyfriend and I come here often and we've never had a problem with food or service. The restaurant environment is very nice, you can also sit outside. It's a perfect lunch spot and they have great desserts for after dinner. Healthy food and big portions, also the location is perfect. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Fantastic selection of dishes and they never disappoint. Upstairs, they have great views of Kierland Commons and the golf course (it's magical at sunset). After numerous visits to Tommy Bahama, I still haven't found an item on the menu that I don't absolutely love. It's great for a date, a business lunch, casual dining or just about any other occasion you can think of. It's even (relatively) kid-friendly. We've brought our two young children with us multiple times since they were three and one-and-a-half and the staff has always been welcoming, friendly and hospitable (no matter the size of the mess!). Needless to say, we'll keep going back."}
{"text":"Everything was great as usual.  One of our favorite places to go because it is always consistent on the food, service, and ambiance."}
{"text":"I dont know what the issue with this place but a year ago!, the service and food were great! But recently about a week ago, was there with my son and the service was poor, server with an attitude!! Many other places to go NOT to have an attitude with dinner, i am done with this joint!!"}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic!!! Brandon took amazing care of us! Got the ribeye and shrimp special and It was amazing. Finished the night off with a pineapple crème brûlée and a malted chocolate pie. Definitely would recommend this place service was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I'm going to make this as short as possible because I can seriously keep talking about this place for days. This is the BEST find yet. My boyfriend and I were roaming around several weeks ago at Kierland Commons looking for a place for dinner. After browsing through all the restaurants, we decided Tommy Bahama, just because the atmosphere outside seemed great and romantic.   They have this Dining After Dark after 8 pm until August 31..so today..so if you read this today hurry up and grab someone to go!! It's $50 for a couple, and you get 2 super yummy Mai Tais with a real flower on top, an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a dessert. The menu for this is very limited, but everything we had on there was heaven.   We went here again last night and I really have to yelp this place because they deserve it. Last time we sat on the first floor listening to the music, this time upstairs sitting by the window looking out. Also, I was wearing a black dress and our hostess came back and gave me a black napkin instead of the white ones on the table. What? Wow, I was so impressed. If I dine in Scottsdale too often, I would be way too spoiled.   Anyways, to the food. We got the goat cheese appetizer again and it is OMG SO GOOD. There's macadamia nuts, mango salsa, soft and fluffy goat cheese, and I just want some more now!!!  We've tried all 3 entrees, and I would say the Snapper is the best. Their almond rice is delicious!! Although my boyfriend says he can't taste the difference between regular rice..  Then of course pina colada cake for dessert. We were so full by then that we had to take the cake home. Had it for breakfast this morning and it is still oh so soft and moist :)   Oh and by the way, their warm bread is SO warm and soft too :) The service has been great the past two times, and I would go back even without the dining after dark deal!"}
{"text":"Food and ambiance were fine but the service was terrible. Server was very slow and did not know much about the drink or menu items. He couldn't answer any of our questions. Then he became defensive and gave us an \"attitude\" the rest of the evening. He kept explaining he has only been there a month and a half. You're there for a month and a half and don't know what is in the Planter's Punch drink among other things? The bus boy was very friendly and explained what was in the butter. The bus boy knew more than the waiter. The bus boy also answered our questions about the salad and was right on the spot with more bread. The food and drinks were good and it is a fun island atmosphere.   Some of the items ordered in our party were, Pineapple Jalapeño Mojito, Mai Tai, Jerk Chicken, Filet Mignon, Red, White & Blue Salad, Mandarin Asian Slaw, Pina Colada Cake.  The food was all fantastic.  No problems there.   Hopefully in the future the service will have improved since the food is definitely worth returning for."}
{"text":"We sat outside it was on the 1st floor and it was OK but not the best. Summer our waiter was very helpful, thanks Summer.  The food was good but not wow. I had fish sandwich it come with french fries. I wish they serve sweet potato fries instead of regular potatoes.  The coconut shrimps were over-cooked and it was a hard to cut according to my mother-in law.  There were few flies lingering our food during our lunch, so it was what!  The coconut cake was way to sweet for my taste.  Still don't get it, why they have the patio fire place and the torches on-on day light and it was a warm day.   The price I thought it was a bit to pricey for a regular food like that."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner with great service. The waiter ( Carl) was exceptional and did whatever he could to ensure we had a great dining experience. Plus they had a great selection of wines. Very nice. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've been to Tommy Bahamas for many celebration dinners, but for Father's Day we decided to enjoy our dinner on the patio.  The atmosphere was wonderful. Since it is summer we were nervous about it being too hot but the misters made us forget about the triple digit temperature happening throughout the day. The best part about the atmosphere was the beautiful steel drum being played. There were some familiar tunes played but the entire set was perfect for setting the Caribbean mood.  The food was delicious as always. I order the Blackened Fish Tacos, which are listed under Bungalow Favorites. The pico de gallo added a mild and sweet flavor while the sauce drizzled on top of the tacos gave it a nice spice. My only complaint is that the chef missed the middle taco when drizzling on the sauce. This caused the tortilla of the two taco which received the sauce on the outside of them to be a bit soggy and difficult to pick up. The tacos also come with three plantains in a coconut cream sauce. I'm not the biggest fan of bananas/plantains but thought they were tasty enough to eat. However, the cream had too much of a coconut flavor for me to consume.   Our server was average. He got the job done but wasn't personable or outgoing.  I will definitely be returning and would order the  fish tacos again!"}
{"text":"This place has the location and ambience to be great, but the food limits its potential. The food by no means was terrible, it was simply average and boring. The coconut shrimp needed a little kick and my snapper was somewhat bland. While my fish was paired with excellent sides, but it was presented with the enthusiasm of Bill Belichick in a post game interview. While the food was uninteresting, the service was amazing and my table hammered down some excellent adult beverages as well. The dessert was also exciting. Beyond this the service was outstanding. It is a place with potential, but the food simply lacks."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place and have eaten there several times. They just recently changed their menu but I like the brew additions. The coconut shrimp are awesome and the ahi tuna salad is to for for!  I did have the chimichurri flank steak sliders but they weren't good. Our waitress was great and offered me something else."}
{"text":"Every time I visit my friends in Mesa I force them to take me to Tommy's.  They never disappointment me.  Love everything I drink and eat here.  I also love to shop downstairs."}
{"text":"What a fabulous spot. The atmosphere is just as wonderful as our server, who was amazing. Food was delicious and prices very reasonable. Why don't we have this at the Bay Area?"}
{"text":"An island paradise in the desert! It's become our weekly getaway. You'll find us at our table by the bar. Every time we visit the service is always cool like a island breeze. The menu is island inspired.    It's always one step up from expected.  Coconut shrimp, chicken lollipops and artichoke begin the festivities along with mango iced tea. They have my favorite trio of Tequila's ready to pour! Never sure if in a silver, repo or anejo mood. Ask for Carl at the patio bar. Lunch today will be a chicken sandwich and I think the pineapple cake to finish. Just my favorite place to hang out!"}
{"text":"Seeking tropical excape in the oppresive Phoenix inferno? I'd suggest trying Tommy Bahama's.   Went here for first time yesterday for lunch w/a friend.   Decor was delightful - I felt like I was perhaps in Barbados again? *sigh* They used a lot of light colors as well as wicker/rattan (sp?) furniture, which worked well.   I tried their Steak Salad (yum) and Pineapple Jalapeno Mojito. They paired nicely together. The cocktail was refreshing and unique, served w/a sugar cane stir stick. NOTE: be weary of the pepper seeds shooting quickly up your straw!   Overall, it was a great experience! I only had the ask our server 1x to pls refill my water. But since I'm 1/2 camel, I couldn't fault the server."}
{"text":"Good service, good happy hour, good wine! The waitress was friendly and made some jokes. We surprise ourself and decide to seat on the patio (In the middle of the Summer can you believe it?), it was really relaxing with the misters, the birds and the music. I will be back as usual!"}
{"text":"Yum! My future in-laws treated me to dinner here tonight. I had shrimp and scallops with rice in a coconutty sauce and it was awesome! Correction: Jumbo-sized scallops and large shrimp. I inhaled my food and enjoyed mine so much I didn't notice what anyone else had! Great-tasting food and excellent service... i docked one star because the dishes, while delicious, were a little pricey."}
{"text":"Came to here to see Julie..one of my favorite bar tenders...unfortunately she had the day off..so Carl had helped us. He was great. Fun and full of energy and kept the drinks flowing... 3rd time around of having a great experience at Tommy Bahamas!!!!"}
{"text":"Was there for Happy Hour on Thursday, August 28th.  Service was excellent and the food matched the service.  Our waiter, Carl, was extremely helpful and made the experience extremely enjoyable.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"I was really impressed that the regional manager, Patrick, actually reached out to me and my team regarding our previous experience at Tommy Bahama's.  He advised that this is not the typical dining experience at Tommy Bahama's and asked that we return to experience the true Tommy Bahama.  Boy did they truly meet the newly set expectations. Our server, Brenda, was a complete 180° from our first experience. She was amazing. So cheery, helpful, and full of energy. She engaged with the table, making us laugh and everything!  The food was also much, much better. I wanted to order the same thing I did the last time so I had something to compare to. My burger was cooked to the correct temperature and no bun! The 3 other diners with me raved about their food as well. Very impressed this time around.  We will definitely be returning to Tommy B's in the future and will be asking for Brenda specifically :)"}
{"text":"This visit was a long time coming, and I chose Tommy Bahama to celebrate my birthday with my family. It was easy to make a reservation and subsequently change it when we wanted an earlier time. We arrived right on time and was told to head upstairs to the hostess stand there. We were seated promptly and got our menus. First impressions: it was busy on a Friday evening and they had a steel drum player on the patio which was neat. Since we had a reservation, we got to sit in their upstairs dining area which had a great view of the mountains and felt spacious enough that we could have our own conversation despite the many groups dining around us. I liked the atmosphere and setting here, simple yet comfortable. Our waiter Brandon was excellent and kept our waters full and answered all our questions. He shared which dishes were popular and we ordered all three of them.  We chose two appetizers to start: coconut shrimp and macadamia goat cheese. Not a big fan of coconut so I only had a bite, but the latter was delicious! I love goat cheese and I liked the corn that came alongside it. For my entree, I went with the blackened fish tacos (a house favorite) which were so good. I don't usually care for corn tortillas but I thought everything came together very well in this dish. I enjoyed the spicy chipotle aioli, the island slaw, and the charred fish. I was able to try from the filet mignon, the halibut (really nice flavor, charred too), the fish and chips, the Thai shrimp and scallops in curry sauce, and the macadamia crusted snapper. My dish also came with a side that wasn't listed on the menu: fried plantains in a coconut condensed milk with pineapples. It was intriguing but not my favorite.   Since it was my birthday, Brandon brought out their dessert plate and I chose their peanut butter chocolate pie. It was brought out with a chocolate disc that says Happy Birthday and he lit a candle. I liked that he emphasized that he wouldn't sing and dance, I like things low key. The pie was incredible, the chocolate was more of a dark and it had a graham cracker crust. I took half of it home to enjoy later.   Overall, I really enjoyed our dinner here. The prices are on the higher side, but the service is wonderful and the place itself is charming."}
{"text":"I have been coming here a few times since my last review, one thing that I can say is that the service has declined. The happy hour prices is what makes me come back, $6 for a cocktail in Scottsdale Quarter is very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Great service, food and ambiance. The ingredients are fresh and the atmosphere is bright airy and clean. The server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Delicious wine list and the cocktails are to die for. They use flor de cana rum from Nicaragua and Van Gogh vodkas which are my two favorite of each liquor. If you like seafood you will definitely be pleased with the fish selections. Happy hour starts at three and the bat was hopping. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ever since moving from Phoenix to Scottsdale, I haven't wanted to drive to downtown Phoenix since it's such a far drive, especially after work during rush hour. Unfortunately, that means I'm missing some of my favorite restaurants! With a specific craving in mind, I went on a search and found Tommy Bahamas. After looking at their menu and their Happy Hour, I told my husband we were going here after work last Friday. I'm glad we did, because we had a really great time!  We arrived about 5pm and it wasn't too packed. We had the option of sitting outside for Happy Hour, or going upstairs into the restaurants indoor bar. We chose outside since the misters were going and wanted to unwind after being inside all day. Our waiter was quick to arrive and take our drink orders. Both of us ordered the Crazy Cuban off the HH menu - a cocktail of rum, pineapple juice, and banana liquor. It was one of my cravings and it definitely hit the spot! Then we ordered the fish tacos and edamame hummus off the HH menu as well. My husband ordered the crab bisque off the dinner menu. The food arrived quickly and we dug in. The tacos were great. We both really enjoyed them and would order them again. The hummus was okay. It was cold and came with long rectangular crackers they called flat bread. To me, flat bread is like pita bread and they were crackers. There's a difference. My husband thought the hummus was good and he ate more of it than me. Still a little hungry, we decided to order the Cuban. Oh god, I am so glad we did. It had pulled pork, ham, gruyere cheese, pickles, and spicy mustard. This was a flavor combination of the gods. My husband and I really enjoyed this and it's our new favorite. It came with Yucca Fries, which we decided to try, but you could sub them for something else. (Yucca Fries are made from the root of the Yucca plant and are like deep fried potatoes - they weren't anything special in my opinion.) Finally, the dessert tray came circling around. They had so many delicious looking desserts to try. A chocolate cake, a butterscotch pudding, a pineapple crème brulee, a pina colada cake, and a chocolate malt tart. We ordered the chocolate malt tart but it was a tough decision. (We'll have to come back to try some of the others.) The tart was delicious was very heavy. We took about 90% of it home to enjoy later.   Overall, it was a great experience and we'll be back. I'd recommend going during Happy Hour especially!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience! Our server Summer was on top of her game. Every time we needed a refill, she was there with a new one. As this was our first time at Tommy Bahama, we asked for recommendations which every drink and entree turned out delicious. Definitely recommend this place and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Always a great stop for Happy Hour. Excellent value for price versus quality. Ahi poke, fish tacos mx coconut shrimp, all excellent. Drinks at the table included mai tais, martini, and wine. Throw in a couple of deserts to share and live music and we had a great evening."}
{"text":"If I was 60 years old and rich, I'd give Tommy Bahama 5 stars...That is the it crowd at Tommy.  With that said, I like it here a lot. The food is good and reasonably priced, the desserts are great and the service and ambiance are very nice.   I've been here a few times, most recently for NYE. On New Years, there was a live band outside, complete with dancing Kierland Cougars. It was a really fun environment, in all seriousness, and it added some nice before and after dinner entertainment.  Food is very good. They offer a whole leaf Caesar salad, which just feels classier to me than the regular option. You get bread with delicious butter, and they have a full bar and great drink menu. When I'm there, I get the Sanibel Chicken for my entree. It's a Parmesan crusted chicken breast, stuffed with herb cheese, then it's pan fried and finished with a red pepper cream sauce. It's just as good as it sounds, and comes with a chive whipped potato and a vegetable (I prefer asparagus). My wife had the ribs and thought the sauce was good but the ribs themselves were a little fatty.  I've had the chocolate cake and the pina colada cake, both are delicious. Word to the wise: Order the \"small\" size of your cake. The large is more or less a whole cake...My chocolate cake from Saturday would have fed a family of 6.  I'm sure I'll be back soon enough with a hunger for that sanibel chicken."}
{"text":"Best food ever, the serve Eddie was amazing and so kind and attentive. If you come here ask for him!!  Also the atmosphere was great and he view was gorgeous. It was a little pricy but worth it. I highly recommend eating here for lunch with friends! Also there is great shopping around and lots do around it"}
{"text":"We walked up to the greeter on the first floor - she seemed to be asleep-at-the-wheel.   I think she told us they didn't have much seating avail on first floor (low talker).   But, she then limbered her arm towards the stairs and said something to the effect of \"you mite be able to find sumpin' up there\".    Well, we thought 'what the hell' and climbed the stairs.  Arrived at the top and told those greeters we had no reservations but could they seat us?   A little silence, some grumbling amongst themselves, next thing you know one of them signaled to follow and walked us to a sweet table.  This table was overlooking the Ocean Club (or whatever that place was across the way) and a great sunset!  The wall was removed effectively seating us 'almost' outside yet in a climate controlled environment.    The drinks (tried a Mai Tai out of the blue - great).   The waitress (sorry, forgot her name, she was blonde though LOL)  Appetizers scallop sliders were great!   Goat cheese was great as well.     3.75 stars for this:  Short rib.    Short Rib.   Short Rib.   Short Rib.  Short Rib.   (but I round down to 3 because 4/5 is incredibly difficult and elusive)  Ahhh....nice view, nice service, nice drinks, kinda pricey, don't buy the clothes, short rib!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here one night when we were in the area. It's a nice place. Kind of feels like dining in a villa somewhere. They had a one man singer/guitar player that was playing a choice selection of atmosphere appropriate tunes from the 70's on up. Some great classics you don't hear often. It really set the laid-back vibe of the place.  As far as the food goes, I had the Cuban and it was great!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with my wife and daughter today. Server was okay. Nothing special, was all business.  My wife split the coconut shrimp and Macadamia Crusted Goat Cheese with my daughter. I ordered the Shrimp Cobb Salad which was very good except the bacon was over cooked was was hard like rocks. Still a nice venue for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I came in a whim one night. We had both had a long week at work and grabbed a drink at another bar first and then randomly decided to mosey on over after doing a little shopping. The only time I had been to a TB was two years ago in Hawaii so that is really all I had to compare it to and I was not let down. From before we even walked in we could hear the relaxing live music coming from the downstairs patio. We were greeted immediately by the welcoming host and we informed him we wanted to grab some drinks from upstairs and sit on the balcony. Shortly after we took our seats our friendly waitress, Jaymi, was on point from the get go. Even though we weren't dining that night she was not reserving any attention from us. By the end of it we were singing praises to the manager, Chad, (who was very nice as well) about our great experience that night. We actually enjoyed it so much that we went back on Saturday night for dinner with the family. Now that a couple of weeks have gone by we actually received an unexpected post card (which is pretty humorous considering we live less than 3 miles away) from our server. Overall, the service is top notch here and we will continue to visit!!"}
{"text":"After moving to the valley last fall this was the very first restaurant our friends took us too.  What a treat!  Love the setting and atmosphere.  Really makes you feel like you're in the islands.  Drinks were amazing (one of the best margaritas I've ever had...good and strong!!).  I had the jerk pork tenderloin...every bite was amazing.  Hubby had the shrimp and scallops.  Finished the meal off with the Pina colada cake (again...amazing) and the evening off with a nice stroll around Kierland.  What a nice welcome to AZ!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful venue for group dinner.  Started with a Mai Tai on the patio watching the sunset through the palms and listening to live music from the guitarist.  Next was coconut shrimp apps. Fantastic! Service never let either my water or wine glass go empty...and I really tried to challenge them with both!  Had Thai shrimp and scallops for main. Curry was very light, and made a perfect pairing with the seafood.  Some sort of tropical cake dessert...coconut and pineapple. Again light and refreshing."}
{"text":"Yummy tacos, great view, 5 star waiter! Delightful first experience, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Tone down the live band. I shouldn't have to shout to talk to somebody 2' away."}
{"text":"Steak salad for lunch, a great choice. Tender thick slices of filet mignon over greens, served with citrus dressing, and roasted potatoes. Perfect! Crab cake appetizer was tasty. But be sure to order the large, as the small portion is only ONE crabcake. Pina colada cake was heavenly, but again, order the full size portion because if you order the small portion you will get only a quarter piece of cake, not a half portion.  Good coffee. Attentive, personable server. Pleasant atmosphere unless you have a party of eight Ravens fans that get seated next to you. There were plenty of other booths available by the way. You would think a hostess would realize that two people dining out do not want that noise."}
{"text":"We stopped on for a drink and snack. The upstairs was so nice with comfy seating and our server was ahhmazing! Def coming back to this place for a nice patio and drinks. And nothing beats excellent service'"}
{"text":"Food good, prices fair. Patio bartenders couldn't keep up, bordered on rude. Upstairs dining area is very small and loud- people were literally shouting!"}
{"text":"Terrible service went to put our name down and the hostess said it would just be a minute and she said we didn't need to take our name. We waited ten minutes by the hostess stand and then asked how much longer and the hostess said we never put our name down. That does not make sense. Never going to try there because they are incompetent."}
{"text":"These restaurants are always very nicely done... decor and construction is amazing, so you get the comfy, island feel while dining there.  The coconut shrimp is OK, but you really need to like coconut to enjoy it.   The macadamia crusted snapper was tasty, but the crust seemed a little too over-cooked, some was charred from the sautéing process.  The Thai Scallops and Shrimp were REALLY tasty, but slightly cool, rather than being as fresh and hot as it should've been.  Their piña colada cake was tasty!  The key lime pie wasn't so tasty, it tasted heavy raw egg custard.   The do have a very nice wine menu though, with many selections, at decent prices.  Service was got was nice.  Our server was friendly and smiled and was attentive."}
{"text":"What a vibe this place has going on! Totally relaxed, huge restaurant with different kinds of seating everywhere. We grabbed a snack and a drink during happy hour at the downstairs bar and we loved the atmosphere down there. We had the mai tai, crazy Cuban and the mojito and all three were delicious and highly recommended. I used to make mai tais as a bartender and the one they served was better than I'd ever had. Bartending staff was great and attentive. Coconut shrimp was awesome! 3 big pieces for $9 but totally worth it. Definitely would recommend for happy hour especially since they do happy hours on Saturdays wooo!"}
{"text":"Lost customer.  We made reservations for 6:30 to celebrate our wedding anniversary .  We asked to sit in the first floor area.  We were told there would be a 45 minute wait.  After an hour and seeing other people without reservations being seated,  we left to go to Zinc Bistro.  It was a great place to eat.  As a long time Tommy Bahama customer, I felt we were treated terribly.  I will no longer rat or shop at any Tommy Bahama store.  They just lost a dedicated customer who used to shop and wear their clothes.  I will now move to other brands.  The service and treatment was inexcusable.  Avoid Tommy Bahama at all costs or enjoy waiting and being treated like a second citizen.   Goodbye TB."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. Ambiance is amazing, food is consistent and wonderful and service is stellar.  Perfect for all types of events.  Corporate dinners and wedding rehearsals.  Love their Seabass and the Ahi Poke is  perfect.  Desert Selection is amazing.  My personal favorite is the Butterscotch pudding made with Dewars Scotch!!  Key Lime Pie is great as well."}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday night for HH. Got seated right away on the patio. Nobody comes to the table. Waiters and waitresses waited on tables all around us but nobody comes over to us. Hostess recognizes we have no drinks or menus after 15 mins so she finds a waiter. He takes our drink order and another 15 mins goes by. He comes back and apologizes but offers no explanation. Other tables have been served drinks and food by now! We got up and left, walked to the Mission a few blocks away, had drinks in about 1 minute, had great food, left a very large tip. Thanks for nothing Tommy."}
{"text":"I don't live in Arizona and I absolutely love this place! There is a great happy hour with beer and cocktails and food. You can shop for clothes and grab great food and drinks all at the same time. If you are in Scottsdale this is a place you want to check out. And don't forget to try and sit outside since the weather is always perfect in AZ."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant. They have some great food options. I'm gluten free so it was nice to see that they offer gluten sensitive options. I had the fish tacos in lettuce shells. They were excellent but I ate them with a fork it was too messy to pick up lol.  My mom has some salad with steak in it. The steak was over cooked and tough. All in all it was a good afternoon afternoon lunch"}
{"text":"*3.5 stars* Tommy Bahama...the clothing company...yes...has a restaurant beside their store. It comes with good reviews.  I agree with the service. Very good. Friendly, attentive, funny and personable.  The ambiance is superb. It feels like you are in a tropical location. Outside seating is scarce and no reservations are allowed. Uptairs and inside they take reservations. Opt for upstairs near a window. Nice breeze on a warm night...ahhh.  The caribbean theme is a nice touch. Fits the location well. It's definitely a wanna be upscale chainish spot inside a high end shopping center.  The food was alright. Nothing different than other chain spots.  Not on the menu is a 3 layered tower of apps. You're limited to what you can get but you will save money and it's enough to feed 4. We decided on: Chicken Lollipops, Coconut Crusted Crab Cakes, World Famous Coconut Shrimp (seriously, world famous?)...CL's were good and worth a try, CC are a pass next time around and CS was very good.  For entrees we split 3 sandwiches:  Cuban Sandwich - a major miss...no one at table enjoyed it. The bread was over toasted, the pork was blah and it seemed like it was missing something, oh that's right, Flavor!  Grilled Chicken Breast Sandwich - was a hit. Everyone enjoyed it. Chicken had great spices and the jerk sauce added great flavor.  House Roasted Pork Sandwich - 2 out of 3 of us liked it. Truth be told I didn't try it because I was stuffed but otherwise it looked good.  Dessert - we all passed but definitely opt to take a look at them. They all look good and the cheesy presentation is worth it. :-)  Drinks - not very potent and pricey. Just go for beer or wine.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved the ambiance with live music, outdoor seating and shopping. So I as afraid the food might be a let down and that was not the case at all. I enjoyed an item featured on the Sunday brunch menu with a homemade buttermilk biscuits, a fabulous southern fried chicken breast topped with a sage sausage gravy and a side arugula salad. These flavors were an unbelievable combination. I will return for the entree!!!My husband stuck to the good old fashioned hamburger and said it was perfectly prepared and he too would return."}
{"text":"What a fantastic evening ! I'll start with our server , Carl ! What an amazing person & waiter , he really was so personable & had great suggestions. The musician was also great for the tropical feeling of the evening .. We felt like we were sea side in Key West ! The dinner was also superb .. We had bacon wrapped scallops, blue crab and avocado salad , lobster fettuccine, Tahitian limeades and wrapped up the evening with key lime pie !  We will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Our meal was exceptionally mediocre.  We don't go on date nights often.  My husband had suggested North or Dominicks.  I'd always wanted to try Tommy Bahamas.  The food was fine, but when you pay $100 for a dinner for two, it should be better than fine.  My husband didn't want to go there because it was a \"chain\".  I had to concede that it tasted like chain food.  The coconut crusted crab cakes were good and had a lot of crab, but they had a \"prepackaged texture\" to them.  I was looking forward to the macadamia crusted snapper, but it was more like macadamia flavored breading, hard to detect the nuts.  My husbands thai (I think) shrimp and scallops was again, decent, but nothing amazing.  I was planning to get key lime pie, but lost interest but how unimpressive our meal was.  Our mai tai was good.  Looking through a handful of reviews I think I'd only consider returning for the happy hour.  The big plus was the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went the other day for restaurant week. They have an absolutely wonderful and delicious menu to coincide with their warm, island-styled environment. We had the Ahi Tuna Tacos and Coconut Shrimp for our appetizer. Both were amazing, the Coconut Shrimp were the best I've ever had. For our entree, we had the Sanibel Chicken and the 6oz Filet Mignon. Again, both were fabulous. I highly recommend the chicken. Our dessert was a triple layer chocolate cake and piña colada cake. Again, both were fantastic. Our server, Cheyne was awesome and I highly encourage anyone who has been thinking about dining here to go now during restaurant week while the prices are a bit more reasonable."}
{"text":"I don't think I've had a bad experience at a Tommy Bahama yet!  This particular location is ultra cool and just a short walk from the Westin Kierland. The downstairs has a HUGE open air patio with a fire pit and an island bar that you can sit all the way around.  The downstairs lounge is definitely prime for people watching at Kierland!  Inside the restaurant is open and very light/airy with some subtle island/resort style accents like a cool succulent mural.  There is another bar upstairs along with two seating areas with floor to ceiling doors that open up.  I sat on the western side upstairs and had a view of the best Sonoran Sunset!  As far as food goes, they had a daily fresh sheet, but I couldn't resist my TB favorites so I opted for the Macadamia Nut encrusted Snapper for my entre.  There are two appetizers that I have to have whenever I am at a TB restaurant.  They are the Goat Cheese and Ahi Poke.  The goat cheese is smooth and creamy formed into an 1\" or so tall circle then topped with pineapple.  It's light and refreshing but also packs a HUGE flavor punch!  The Ahi poke is served with guacamole and capers and is always fresh!  For dessert I had (cant remember the name) but I think it was the PB crunch or something like that.  All you need to know is that it tastes like a giant Reeses cup... no. Joke. GET IT.  The service was insanely fast (I didn't go during peak season) and friendly.  Our server, Sean, was a pretty funny guy and took the time to get to know the personality of our table and then played off of us.  It was a really great time with great friends and great food!  Definitely check them out if you are ever down in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Short walk from Westin Kierland. Fish entrees were good. Enjoyed the crab and avocado salad, which is enough as an entree. Halibut ceviche was disappointing, did not have much halibut."}
{"text":"Go here for the happy hour from 3-6. The other items seem overpriced for what you get. I ordered the happy hour poke Napoleon, shared the goat cheese appetizer and ordered the fish and chips as my main entree. I also had the coco coffee martini as a drink.   The poke was nicely presented with guacamole on the bottom layer with poke on top. I enjoyed the creaminess of the avocado with the well seasoned poke. I would have liked more flatbread chips to go with the poke though since I ran out part-way through eating the dish. The goat cheese was a delicious blend of creaminess mixed with the crunchy macadamia nut crust and sweet, slightly tart mango layer on the bottom.   I wasn't too impressed with my main dish. The fish and chips was a nice presentation of 3 battered pieces of fish, yuca fries and coleslaw. While the fish was flaky and tender on the inside I didn't care for the bread-like, more doughy nature of the batter. I also thought that the coleslaw might have been good as a component in a sandwich but too acidic for my tastes on its own as a side. It needed more sweetness to balance out all the acidic flavor. The yuca fries were well seasoned and lightly fried. I also didn't care for the flavor of the chipotle aioli (Too sour tasting) and the tartar sauce (Also on the verge of being too sour). At $22 for the plate I thought it was way too much money for what I received.   I didn't really like the coco coffee martini ($6). It was way too sweet and had too much of a one dimensional taste.  We sat on the patio and had a lovely view of Kierland Commons, enjoying the perfect mild weather. The patio is the way to go during happy hour!  Service was overall decent although our server seemed a bit peeved at us towards the end of our meal. Who knew we would be causing him such consternation by asking to have separate checks for a two person table?   At $38 for a happy hour small plate, entree and non alcoholic drink the price was way too steep for the quality of the food I received. If I go here again I'll just stick to their happy hour small bites since I did enjoy the poke and the goat cheese dish."}
{"text":"If there was an option for 0 stars I would do that. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Mother's Day lunch was supposed to be perfect and relaxing. NOPE. We made a reservation for 1:15 pm. Didn't get seated until almost 1:35-1:40. Our server didn't come for 15 min or so. Took 25-30 min to even see our server after our drinks and appetizers were served. We originally told her we were in a bit of a hurry due to my sister who had to be at work by a certain time. We gave plenty of time to eat and be back into town for her to be at work. We waited an hour and 15 min to receive food and guess what.... we never even got to eat. We couldn't wait any longer. We said we just wanted to pay for what we already drank or had for an appetizer. They were very rude about it and talking back to us about how long we had waited. Absolutely ridiculous. Ruined my Mother's Day today. I've never had such a bad experience anywhere. I've had a better experience at the DMV!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I have has in a while. Great staff, fantastic food, and beautiful view. Must have the coconut shrimp and the chicken pops. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere for a bar or a restaurant. Good food and great staff.   My wife & I tried the coconut shrimp, filet mignon flat bread, chicken lollipops, scallop sliders, and pulled pork quesadilla. All of it was delicious. She also has a special sangria and I had a jalapeño & pineapple mojito. Similar to the food, the drinks were delicious.   Being from LA, it was our first time here. If you're in Scottsdale, we highly recommend it."}
{"text":"What an incredible night at Tommy Bahama! The latest renovation is highly welcoming to any looking for a relaxed experience outdoors with great service and tasty food/beverages. Drink of choice- mojito with cilantro, cucumber and jalapeño. The mixologists are very talented and landed the perfect mix each time. Also recommend the coconut shrimp and ahi tacos. Whether you're in for a happy hour (3-6pm) or first romantic date- or a private event, as they offer two large all-windowed rooms upstairs, one having a breathtaking view of the mountains- you're set for a great night. In addition to dining, cap your night off with a trip to the TB product lounge. Plenty of apparel and clothing to please the casual heart!"}
{"text":"Celebrated mom's 90th birthday at Tommy Bahamas in Scottadale with this sisters! Great food,(steak salad, coconut shrimp), great company and our server Miroslav is the best. He took great bare of mom! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour for a few drinks with friends. Service was great and the drinks were even better!   Our server was so kind, even gave my friend a free dessert for his birthday.   Cloud nine martini on the happy hour menu is absolutely delicious!   Will surely return. Love the live music! Looking forward to taste different martinis.  5/5"}
{"text":"I came here tonight to meet a friend for a drink.  We haven't seen each other in awhile, and I have to say that this place was a great place to meet somebody and just talk.    Of course we ended up getting an appetizer (the quesadilla...which we asked for without goat cheese.  I never had asparagus in my quesadilla before, but I have to say that it was really good!) and we got iced tea to drink.  If there was something that impressed me was how many times the waiter came by to refill our drinks...without ASKING!  I never knew they did that anymore....  I loved the atmosphere of this place.  The staff was very friendly.  What I really liked was that I didn't feel like I was sitting on top of anybody.  Everything was laid out nicely and spaciously.  The only thing that was negative was the prices...they were a little outrageous.  But I never really complain if I get great food and great service."}
{"text":"I have finally found my favorite happy hour place ever ! Well except for one by the beach in San Diego:) BUT ! If there was an ocean near this restaurant, it is the epitome of perfect. I love the vibe, decor and music this place has; it screams tropical. Their patio is nice and open and if you were to close your eyes, you would feel you were in a bar in Hawaii.   Not only am I in love with the decor and ambiance, but the food was INCREDIBLE! I was here for happy hour, so I was able to try a few different things. It is no wonder it says world famous coconut shrimp. I could have ordered 5 orders of those and it wouldn't have been enough. The macadamia crusted goat cheese is soft and flavorful. I love poke so I always get it everywhere, and it actually was my least favorite thing I got. I also ordered the fish tacos ( on happy hour ), per our servers recommendation, and they were extremely satisfying , I ate two and they are not small. For drinks, I of course stuck with the Mai Tai to fit with the theme and not only was the drink pretty but the perfect amount of alcohol.   I have already recommended this place to a ton of people ! I would recommend it for happy hour so you can try a bunch of different things, but I'm sure their dinner is just as top notch. I keep trying to come back with other people, schedules just haven't worked. But I can't wait to come back and ear some more of that shrimp !  Just truly in love with this place :)"}
{"text":"Quite upscale. The atmosphere was amazing. We sat outside. It was a tad chilly, so they had the heaters on. There was also a musician playing a piano on stage.  Very mood-setting.  The drinks were \"ok\".  Seemed fairly weak in strength, for the price. The apple/goat cheese risotto though......YUM! Food overall was very good. We will be back."}
{"text":"Horrible service and overall experience!! Cups were dirty and service was horrible and to top thing off we found a hair in our food... Disgusting"}
{"text":"Aside from the 'chain restaurant' feel to Tommy's, I must say that the food served was pretty good....the Sea Bass was described as 'Long Line Caught...' I guess it sounds better than just plain line caught SeaBass???  More time for the bass to say goodbye to his sea friends or less diesel fuel tastes....Anyway, it was excellent in all aspects...served perfectly on a generous plop of mash potatoes with perfectly cooked asparagus inserted into the mash bed with a nice chunk of SB.  Several other in our group of 40+ ordered the same and all raved about it.   Desserts trio was also good and the service made up for the over commercialization of shirts, shorts and appetizers.  Live steel drum/singer dude throughout the evening made us feel a little tropical.  It's within walking distance from the Westin Kierland Resort if it's not 105 dry heat!  Shuttle service is offered of course."}
{"text":"We visited on a warm afternoon for happy hour.  I ordered a Mai Tai and my husband tried to order a Bud Light.  No Bud Light.  He managed to find an offering the bartender suggested and it worked.  We ordered the coconut shrimp appetizer. The shrimp are big and come with a dipping sauce.  I am not a shrimp fan but tried these anyway and they were pretty good.  My husband is a huge fan.  Items are a little pricey but the quality of the food is on point and the service was impeccable.  I loved my fresh flower in my Mai Tai!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Best margaritas and fish tacos so far in the valley. The Hawaiian Poke is cut a little too small for my liking, but my girlfriend loves it like that. FYI- we are from Hawaii, and she would end up cutting her Poke pieces small just like TB\"s.  Haven't had full meals here both times we visited so I can't really coment more on this place."}
{"text":"Great mojitos! The sea bass was to die for, it far exceeded our expectations."}
{"text":"Who wants to ruin a rare date night by sending the food back?  So with brave smiles we fought our way through our meals and tried to focus on the positives:  The perfect table that the nice greeter sat us at , The friendly and solicitous server, The great crab bisque, The perfectly cooked sea bass.  But really, how hard does one have to work to make pork ribs tasteless?  And who in the world thought it would be a good idea to comprise half the ribs' side dish with raw red onions?  For the life of me, I couldn't tell what that side was supposed to be.  The sea bass special that was supposed to have this delicate horseradish sauce turned out to be oversauced with something better described as gloppy than delicate.  Its flavors clashed with the sea bass, as did the mashed potatoes...though the three did make a nice white monochrome statement on my plate.  The accompanying baby bok choy was overcooked/mushy.  We were so disappointed (disappointed doesn't describe how my stomach felt all night) that it ruined date night anyway, so we should have spoken up."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place!!! We have been there for lunch, dinner and happy hour and all were 5 star experiences! The service is always amazing and the food is DELISH! The coconut shrimp, the artichokes, the goat cheese app, the cold cod entree, the fish tacos, snapper entree and the fish and chips are legit! Don't forget the raspberry mojito (off menu but AH-MAZING!) all the monitors come with real sugar cane garnish. Come here! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We went here for Mothers Day and experienced a very disorganized manager and staff. After being called by the restaurant to make sure we arrived on time or you would lose your table, we made sure we came early only to wait another 45 min for a table to be ready. The manager seemed to not care about this long wait and was somewhat condescending in his responses to us. I have dined here many times and it has been great, but the general manager is not very good."}
{"text":"The best happy hour in town! 100%! Amazing fish tacos, shrimp, sliders & more. The amazing thing? Happy Hour is 7 days a week! Indoor & outdoor bar with live tropical music."}
{"text":"The remodel is great! Took my son here for his first time and he loved it! He's not a big seafood lover so he got the bacon cheeseburger. I think he was drooling. :-). I got the crab cakes again! Can't help it!   Zack our waiter was on top of it, very professional and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Food was good - atmosphere was everything - we will go back."}
{"text":"I can't say enough wonderful things about this restaurant! It is a favorite for special occasions, business lunches, holidays, and happy hours. Management and staff are genuinely wonderful people, and the restaurant itself is gorgeous with a tropical ambiance truly missed in the desert! Menu is delicious and I am not a dessert person but can never say no to something from their spread. A great escape and place to go when you want to impress a guest!"}
{"text":"HUGE fans of the clothing brand not so much of the restaurant.  Dined here for the first time a few weeks ago. Made reservations prior for my husbands Birthday.  Our server was ok, but down played what I wanted to order which was the ramen. I appreciated his honesty however, I ended up with the French Dip Sandwich and there was nothing special about it. Very bland. My son had the Cuban Sandwich which was dry, bland and pretty disappointing. My husband had the Smokehouse Bacon Burger which was ok, but pretty pricey for what it's worth. My daughter had the appetizer shrimp for her main meal & it seemed to be one of the more popular plates.   The best part of the meal was dessert. Peanut Butter pie-rich & decadent. The pineapple creme brûlée was divine, just wished it had, had a little more custard in the section of pineapple. Presentation was perfect for this place.    Atmosphere is just as a would imagine the Bahamas to be! In my opinion  the vacation would have been better than the dining experience."}
{"text":"You know, I thought this would be full of a bunch of old people, and it was.  But their happy hour was great (order the fish tacos) and the cocktails were decent (though you guys need to learn how to make a Mai Tai the proper way)."}
{"text":"We couldn't decide were to go the other night and finally decided on Tommy's. Tommy's is right on the edge of the Kierland's. Walking in and the bottom floor was packed so we went upstairs and we were able to get a table. Very Hawaiian and ocean like atmosphere. Very calming. One thing, the booths has wooden seats (no cushions).   So we started off with the World Famous Coconut Shrimp with Asian slaw. The shrimp was good but when you state World Famous then my expectations are really high. This was really good but world famous? The Asian slaw was really good too. All I can say is everyone was ordering the shrimp. My wife ordered the Crab Bisque which she enjoyed but made one mistake. She let my son eat some and only got back an empty bowl.   I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Sanibel Chicken which is a chicken breast split and stuffed with a red pepper cream sauce with mash potatoes and Broccolini. The chicken was very moist and the cream sauce was really good with a little of crab meat in it. The sauce wasn't too rich but really good. My wife ordered the Mahi Mahi and I was really surprised that it was really moist and really good. She enjoyed it and gobbled it up.   So we ended our meal with Piña Colada Cake and Key Lime Pie. Oh my goodness. You talking about desserts. These are so good. The cake was so light and smooth plus they gave us a huge piece. I enjoyed it so much I couldn't stop eating it. The pie was so good. It had a graham cracker crust. All I can say is outstanding.   Our server was really good. He kept our drinks filled. One thing is that I know he was new because he just didn't feel confident and kept stumbling on the menu but he did know the menu very well. So I will give him a break. He recommended the Parmesan Crusted Sanibel Chicken so I give him a lot of credit for that.   Overall, good food, good atmosphere, and good service. Both times I've been here at Tommy's it's always been loud and lots of energy in the room. So enjoy"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with some friends after a meeting and it was a great find. We sat outside and enjoyed a great atmosphere and equally great food. Next time I am in town, I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience. This is a bit of a splurge for us ($150 for 2) so we only go a couple of times a year.  Nice atmosphere to unwind and enjoy a relaxing  meal.  Crab cakes and lobster bisque were outstanding.  First time having pina colada cake and it was delicious (normally share key lime pie or malted chocolate pie, both delicious too)."}
{"text":"This place has a beautiful open-air bar. Gorgeous tropical environment and great food. But very pricey. My husband and I stopped in late one evening to have a drink. It was about an hour before closing and only a few other people were there. We ordered a Greyhound and a draft. It wasn't until we got home that we noticed our bill. The bartender charged us $20 just for the Greyhound! After tip, we ended up paying about $30 just for two drinks. I think the bartender must have been trying to meet a quota..."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend checking this spot out. Me and my girlfriend felt like we were out on a tropical vacation being here. Also, the happy hour menu on there tropical drinks are great. We tried there mai tai, crazy Cuban, mojito and coconut shrimp. All were so delicious and flavorful. The happy hour and regular menu items looked so delicious. I will be back to try there normal dinner menu. Staff was attentive and professional. Love music and 2 bars with lots of seating. Also being in Kierland, you can walk around and check out some stores after dinner. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Took my wife out for our Anniversary Dinner to the newly reniveted Tommy Bahama Resteraunt at the Kierland commoms.  We could not complain about the food or the service which was good but not great for the price.  This was our third visit to their flagship restaruant, the atmosphere was  comfortable in the past, not now.  Although it looked liked (not sure of) they were still under renivation the direction they are going is missing the mark, charm, romance and ambiance of the past.  I must say this restaraunt is not deserving of the standards of being in one of the most exciting places in Phoenix, Scottsdale, The Kierland Commons.    The new look does not fit to the Tommy Bahama Theme, I should have felt like I was on vacation taken to a romantic beach get away, but I was not.  I am was very disappointed with the atmosphere it did not matter how good the food or service was.  We spent the evening joking about the cheap desert mural on the one wall that was out of place even for Arizona Standards.  The desert mural yes desert boring mural was off base with any theme they are going for. Not only boring but the worst pictures of the desert and catus they could have picked. I just wanted to jump off of this cliff.  They should have consulted with Arizona Highways before picking these horrable pictures.  The interior decorator problably not even from Arizona or has ever picked up an issue of Arizona Highways.  I am sure Arizona Highways has plenty of pictures for sale.  I am sure Tommy Bahamas could afford to pay for a photographer or pay for better pictures, looks like random pictures from the interent an insult to photography and photographers sorry if I insulted the amateur photographer that took these pictures, so so sorry.  Bash me if you want but the blame falls on the interior designer hired, who should be fired as well as the branding consult who probabl works in dreary office and has no idea whats is going on, in their own Scottsdale Resteraunt or just does not care.  Do not make any future mistakes the designer most go before its too late.  Tommy Baham restaraunts should live up to the same standards of its fine line of clothing.  One other note, the unfinished hideous closet in the main resteraunt should be dismantled and relocated, although it does fit right in with the hideous desert mural on the adjacent wall, the whole wall what a blunder....  Just trying to get my point across, hoping it might help.  Time for awake up call to get your restaruant back ontrack, or maybe get of the restaraunt business and stick to what your good at.....  Paul G"}
{"text":"Fantastic, had the ribeye and chicken lollipops. Food there is always delicious and has a great atmosphere:-)"}
{"text":"Came here for my mom's birthday, I wanted to do something special! We got a little of everything my grandma had the sangria! Very tangy and but sweet super tasty , the crusted macadamia snapper was excellent!!! Id highly recommend that , the servers are great ! We did have reservations because we had more than 5 , it would've been nice to know sooner about the private dining room but nonetheless its a heads up for next time. I will admit it was a little loud and hard to hear my family members but it was the weekend , either way i had fun , great food and great experience"}
{"text":"Strong drinksss.  I walked over here with some other folks from the Restaurant Leadership Conference next door.  Tommy Bahama was actually our second choice, we couldn't get in at the first spot.  We managed to snag seat in the upstairs bar area.  Service was fast and friendly throughout the meal.  We shared an appetizer of Big Island Goat Cheese which was coated in macadamia nut pieces and served with strips of thin, crunchy flat bread.  It was pretty good.  I had a bowl of lobster bisque which was also very tasty.  It could have used more lobster, but still, very good.  I had one cocktail, the kumquat.  I don't recall what was in it other than a 5th of some sort of alcohol.  What sold me on the drink was the house made sours.  Very good drink, good size and I would say two will knock you on your ass, one gets you half way there.  At $13 it's a pricey drink though.  3.75 stars, a strong showing for me, an anti-chain kind of guy."}
{"text":"Love coming here for lunch and happy hour! Meals are always fresh and very yummy! There's a variety of drink options. There's an outside bar/patio/lounge area as well as space inside and it's always been a fun time every time I've been!"}
{"text":"Very nice outside bar. There's an upstairs bar happy hour 3 to 5. wonderful martinis,  friendly bartenders. Blackened fish tacos were amazing. Great environment close to shopping. Kirkland commons is a nice shopping and restaurants"}
{"text":"We are locals and have been to lunch here several times in the past and had always enjoyed the experience. Today was a real disappointment. The new decor is a major step backward and the noise level was off the chart. It is nearly impossible to carry on a conversation due to the poor acoustics. The service was O.K. but certainly not what we had experiences in the past. The iced tea was served warm with 2 or 3 ice cubes which melted in minutes. Had to request more ice which eventually showed up. C'mon folks ice is cheap. Sorry Tommy but we will not be back."}
{"text":"The best place on Scottsdale for great good, friendly and fast service and awesome drinks. I love this place, (sorry Toby)!!! My server Andrea giving me the goose (Grey Goose that is) and Brandon who just had to get in a head shot...but a nice guy who is there if you need him  If you visit, and you should, their encrusted goat cheese is to die for and their salads are yummy too!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Very relaxing upstairs and of course, I came home with a new shirt."}
{"text":"what did i like about this restaurant...everything. we came here on a monday for lunch.  it was not crowded so was seated immediated while we waited for another couple to come. got their wonderful ice tea and some bread and butter spread...beautiful thing. clean restaurant and the service was terrific. we then ordered. our food came out all together and it was all great.   the scallop sliders...the basil and tomato in there just brought the beautiful taste to it.  we then realized the kobe burger was very done while we asked for medium rare. the waiter came and wanted to have another one brought out ASAP for us.   we decided to just keep it and shared the burger instead. the manager came by and stated he heard what happened and will provide us free dessert plus remove the burger order from our bill. he then also came back with coupons for some amounts off our next bill when we come back.   now that's awesome service! our ice tea glasses were always full.  the bread/butter spread were came out a few times as the waitress realized how much we liked it. the dessert was the bomb!  If we were ever in the area again, i will definitely eat here."}
{"text":"Nice and convenient to the Kirkland commons shopping center. The outdoor seating is warm when misters are not operating. Food is average. Had French dip: messy and just ok. Yucca fries are bland, regular potato fries were pretty good."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and have not been disappointed each time I've been there.  Tonight was no different.  While the food alone is worth the trip to Tommy Bahamas, the service has always been excellent.  Our server was friendly and provided excellent advice.  He was not kidding when he mentioned that a lot of staff love the Mac and Cheese from the kids menu.  Our youngest ordered that and it was very good.  I had the special and it too was delicious.  The piña colada cake was very good and not too sweet.    Will definitely be back the next time we are in Scottsdale.  NOTE: They do have a discount for guests staying at the Westin Kierland resort."}
{"text":"My  boyfriend and I went there for drinks. The drinks were good but I ordered the crab bisque to go and tasted it later. It tasted like cream and butter. Where is the crab or seafood broth?  It was horrible. I can't image what their entree would taste like."}
{"text":"Great ambience, either indoors or outdoors. Both the appetizers and entrees are excellent. The menu is not too exotic, but covers the gamut between seafood, steak, and chicken."}
{"text":"I came in on Saturday night for dinner and had the best service I've had in years. 5 star all the way around.  We had the filet minion and the mahi mahi, both suggestion from Jeff our waiter.  My date was celebrating a birthday and he made it the perfect experience!  Thanks Tommy' s. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Thoroughly unimpressed with this place. Food was mediocre, considering the price. Hostess asked if we had a reservation, then frowned when I said no. We were seated within 60 seconds, so what's the difference with no reservation? Staff personality was lukewarm.   We've been coming out to Scottsdale for the last 9 years, but we won't be coming back to TB."}
{"text":"We loved the Tommy Bahama on the Big Island, so we thought we would give this one a try. I would compare it to an Apple Bee's. Service was extremely slow and the restaurant was dead. Food was mediocre at best. Since there are so many amazing dining options in Scottsdale, I would suggest skipping this one."}
{"text":"Love TB! Place had amazing ambiance, a great menu, and a very nice theme. Staff is super friendly and food delicious. We had a birthday lunch here for my husband and they were very accommodating when we had extra guests arrive!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is comfortable and the food is pretty good.  We went for lunch one day.  My Sister had the tuna salad which was excellent.    The downsides?  The service was pretty bad, and the menu is totally overpriced.  When you pay $20 for a salad, the service better be exceptional.  And it was not.  I probably would not go back."}
{"text":"Came to Tommy Bahama for dinner/happy hour with my company as part of our annual sales conference. Granted, this was in mid/late August but still totally worth the 5-star review as the amazing event still resonates in my mind. Whoever from the restaurant helped plan and execute this event with my co-worker did a wonderful job. Our conference was at the Westin Kierland, so all we had to do was cross the street and be there.   The hosts kindly showed the bunch of us who over walked together up to the private upstairs dining area where some people already were ready with a drink. We had drink coupons for two special house drinks - mojitos and mai tais. Since there were a few people who didn't care to drink, I was able to imbibe in both! I could tell that both weren't just pre-made mixes, everything was just better. The mai tais had a little too much rum, but just my personal preference. As the sun began to set, we were moved to the more formal dining area. Since our menu was already set, all we had to do was select our appetizer, main course & dinner. I'm a huge fan of their coconut shrimp so it was easy to select that as my appetizer. Our server suggested the scallops for the main course and I have no regrets going with that! He also suggested the Key Lime Pie over Peanut Butter Pie. Definitely tasted like what I had experienced in Key West.   Thank you to the Tommy team for the fun evening!"}
{"text":"Can't speak for the food, but probably the best spot to grab a drink (sit at outside bar) in Kierland Commons. Beautiful bar atmosphere, clean, minimalistic, yummy tropical drinks and very friendly bartenders. Nice view of palm trees and Westin Kierland. Right on the main corner so easy to access."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere in this place. Makes me really feel like I'm in paradise. Ordered the small plate of fish tacos for happy hour and they were so good that I ordered them again. Fish was cooked perfectly and the creamy slaw on top was refreshing and a tad bit acidic. I will be coming back to order these again and possibly the plantains as well."}
{"text":"Really nice place. Enjoyed our lunch outside on the lower patio. Crab and avocado salad with lime and caper vinaigrette. Our server, Ben was very attentive.   Would love to try the upstairs cafe next time."}
{"text":"I'm on a business trip and desperately needed to get off the \"reservation\" after three days of catered food at the same place.  My friend and I asked for a recommendation from the Fairmont staff and they steered us to Ocean Club. After looking at the menu prices, we decided we couldn't do swing the extremely high cost. That's how we came across Tommy Bahama's.  Not only was the food cheaper, but the restaurant vibe was much more chill. Exactly what we were looking for.  I ordered the parmesan crusted sanibel chicken which also came with a side of mash and broccolini based on my waiter's recommendation. Great call. I especially enjoyed the red pepper cream sauce which went nicely with everything on the plate.  I wish I had room for dessert. All of it was enticing but I had to pass for the sake of my waistline.  Great service, location, food, atmosphere, and place to go for food, drinks, and to chill out with co-workers and friends."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Tommy B's many times I love the ambience and the decor. I love the scallops sliders and the goat cheese appetizers. The steak salad for lunch is my absolute favorite, as for dinner I am also a fan of the Ahi Tuna prepared any way. The staff are very attentive and make you feel welcome. If you become a regular as I have they all come up and talk to you and make you feel welcome. The only minor dissapointments I have is the Sangria it is inconsistant and can be bitter at times and the desserts are okay but not the best."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Perfect for a special occasion, like a graduation or any family get together."}
{"text":"Large party of 8, no reservations and got lucky that two open tables available at bar/lower level area. Our waitress was attentive and friendly.  Picked this restaurant because of being mistaken for Bahama Breeze so expecting Hawaiian Applebees so pleasantly surprised. Vast menu with some well layered offerings. For a chain, interesting menu mix. Chef tasting brought to table of lump crab on fried wonton, nice touch and very delicious. Crab bisque was quite good and recommended. Crab salad for two people, ahi poke, shrimp Caesar, macadamia nut crusted snapper with almond rice and grilled asparagus . kids meals don't count- chicken fingers x2, all American burger. Snapper was good, asparagus was decent and rice was over cooked on verge of no texture.  2 out of three not bad. Nice beachy upscale ambiance, should have worn board shorts to fit in, but didn't."}
{"text":"Went this last week ! Food was great! And while it wasn't packed it took an hour and 1/2 for lunch at 1:30 ! Won't be back real soon ! Offered no explanation about how everyone around us got their late lunch , and we waited ! To many other choices !"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday Night with a group of 6. The menu, while not extensive did offer something for everyone's taste. My wife and I did splits on a Pork sandwich and a shrimp pasta dish. Both were very good and for a change, I did would have been OK with  either meal (which happens occasionally when the Mrs. doesn't want one because its too spicy and I like spicy :).    And given the cost of their clothing line, I was pleasantly surprised that the restaurant prices were not outrageous!"}
{"text":"Great Service, especially at the bar!  Fabulous, Zaya Rum tastes as good as cognac.  Food to die for.  No complaints here.  Relaxed, carefree, resort-like feel."}
{"text":"Happy hour s great...loved the sliders, pulled pork quesadilla and sangria.  Staff is very friendly and efficient. Love the bar area upstairs. All in all and without a doubt it is a relaxing environment...  The dinner menu also looks great but  haven't had a chance to try it out yet."}
{"text":"The reason why I am giving this a 1 star is that I cant give it a 0 star. My husband and I were stuck in their elevator for 20 minutes.  Ok I know things happen, but for the emergency call button not to work was TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE! I am in the food industry, and knowing that their elevator is the on way for disabled to get to their restaurant is via elevator. I was very pissed and I am still broken out in hives and traumatized from the experience last week. However, the food was good. And the presentation was beautiful. Yes, we still dined there, despite our mishap."}
{"text":"Carl and Beth in the outside bar are amazing!  Eggs Benedict with crab cakes was delicious. Carl even resrarched our favorite old Tommy Bahama drink called the captains orders and made it perfectly also had martinis with blood orange"}
{"text":"I love this place the drinks are so yummy always makes you feel like you're on vacation"}
{"text":"It was a cold, rainy day. My former roomie and I entered TB's store. Now stop right here! I do not shop at TBs. I'm trying to get to the restaurant. The store? Pahhhleeeze....it looks like the changing room for a bunch of Magnum P.I.'s extras. When I see, the older, white, Scottsdale men, wearing these hideous shirts, tucked into their pleated khaki shorts and their tassled loafers, I seriously want cover them in burlap and throw them into a van. That said, I had a delicious sea bass preceded by perfect crab cakes. We downed a bottle of Pinot Noir and waited for the storm to pass. And waited. And waited. The dining room has windows on three sides and we felt as though we were witnessing a true Bahaman hurricane. ALthough service was great and the food was good, all in all, too overpriced for what you got. But the next time it monsoons, I'm gonna rally up the gang and head to TB's for some mai tais and to make fun of the Tom Selleck wanna be's!"}
{"text":"Andrea can multi-task  better then any one else. Bartend and waitress without interruption!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday for happy hour (September 14,2017, catching up on reviews).  I ordered a pineapple paradiso martini. Very delicious and refreshing with a beautiful presentation.   I ordered off the hh menu the coconut shrimp but didn't get full bc I had a light lunch that day.  Next my friend and both ordered the filet mignon salads and they were so yummy and such a treat. Return factor is high."}
{"text":"Great choice for the family! We enjoyed the fish and chips, fish tacos and burgers! Wonderful space with lots of open seating."}
{"text":"Environment is so nice. Decorations are exotic, gets me thinking about vacation! Try the coconut shrimp it's awesome :)) and ask for emily!"}
{"text":"Tommy Bahama for the win tonight!   My crazy family showed up on a Friday night before a holiday asking for a table for 12.  With a bit of a wait (expected) they said they could accommodate us.  Well our family (note the crazy part) was actually going to be a party of 16.  The staff totally worked with us to accommodate the whole group at a very busy time.  Then we had excellent and attentive service, drinks kept moving and flowing and the food was very timely!   I had not been before and the food was great - those mango chicken \"lollipops\" were delicious!   The crab bisque was very good and the fish tacos were awesome. Then the desserts were shared and were also excellent.  Plates were removed promptly and the service team was pleasant and kind and just did a super job with our rowdy group."}
{"text":"Holy moly. So who knew they even had a restaurant? We've now been twice. The first time we found walking around, checking out Kierland when we first moved here. We walked up to take a look but they were closed for a private event, but because we walked up and asked they gave us a $20 coupon for our next visit. Awesome! First time we went for dinner. I could have buckets of the crab bisque and baskets upon baskets of the star shaped, soft rolls. i got the appetizer sampler with coconut shrimp, goat cheese and crab cakes as my entree and Greg got the scallops. All really excellent. I don't like scallops usually because they are too fishy. I tried these, so, so good and sweet. 2nd trip, we took my mom for drinks and appetizers at happy hour. Drinks were tasty, appetizer sampler again and I got the scallop sliders, decadent! The decor is nice, think tommy Bahama store and you've got the idea. Nice bar and great patio. The service at dinner time was really great, the server was very nice and attentive, bit busier on the patio at happy hour, but clearly they operate with good service in mind."}
{"text":"We ate at Tommy Bahama's for the first time tonight, but it sure won't be the last. The food was delicious, the staff friendly and accommodating, and the management team professional and incredibly attentive. From the moment we sat down, our bartender Brian was there to help before we could ask. It was almost as if he could read or minds. On top of that, the manager Zach was awesome!! I mistakenly ordered a side dish that was not allowed with my diet. Zach came by, asked what I was allowed to eat, and had the kitchen prepare a custom side that was absolutely incredible! Not only will we come again, we will recommend this place to all our friends. Thank you Tommy Bahamas, and thank you Brian and Zach!!"}
{"text":"Umm TB was great i would be back for Saturday brunch and happy hour! Daniel was great funny and they helped us celebrate my friends bday! The ambiance in this place is just do die for! I just have to go back"}
{"text":"We have lived in the area for 2 years now. So many times we would say, \"We've GOT to check this out\", but would end up somewhere else. We FINALLY made it in for dinner. It was Saturday night on Labor Day weekend, but we got there early enough to sit at a nice table on the downstairs patio. The atmosphere was reminiscent of our honeymoon in Kauai :-) Our server David approached immediately and was very attentive throughout the meal. Even though he was obviously very busy, he never appeared rushed and made us feel very welcome. The live music was wonderful and added to the experience. The food defies description. Beautiful presentation and flavor off the hook! My husband had ribs that are honestly among the best we've had so far in AZ. I had the black cod. FANTASTIC! Very moist, tender and flavorful.   I am meeting my sister there for lunch tomorrow :-)"}
{"text":"I recently had a private event at Tommy Bahama and was so pleased I needed to post!  Alli Manz, event manager was so accommodating, easy to work with and an all around professional.  She went above and beyond taking care of all pre-event, and on-site day of needs, with the result being a seamless event and wonderful time had by all! Brandon our party server gave excellent service and was also extremely helpful and accommodating!  If you need to host a private event in a beautiful space with amazing cuisine- do not hesitate and go see Alli Manz!  She will take great care of you!"}
{"text":"OK....here we go again... Name brand... very sceptical... My wife had the filet, mushroom reduction sauce... actually quite good... I had the French dip... Better than expected. The margaritas very good. Why only 4 stars ???? No salsa for the guacamole and chips ....OK lame... but I have no other excuses. Kimberly (Kimmy) very good wait person, very attentive!"}
{"text":"John our server was the best  A hit all around  Birthday fun day!  Crab cakes, coconut shrimp, Ahi Poke and blacken fish tacos were the fare.  Mai tai with Flor De Can are the best"}
{"text":"I had a lovely salad today. A bed of shredded lettuce on sliced tomatoes, topped with avocado, a mound of blue crab and crowned with feta cheese. A glass of passion fruit tea and warm bread to round out the meal. The setting was upstairs in a quiet air conditioned part of the restaurant. The service was fast and friendly. If you haven't tried this place, it is worth a visit."}
{"text":"We had another very enjoyable meal at Tommy Bahama's. There's such a wide selection on the menu (as well on the cocktail & wine menu) that there should be something for every palate. Not that I can seem to deviate from the Scallop Sliders. I always get them! This time, though, they were over-seasoned. The Black Sea Bass entree was excellent.  The \"Orange Curtain\" is a sweet n sour rum treat ~ a nice way to begin.   I want to make a special note that the hostess was exceptional. She truly embodied a \"welcoming\" attitude and gladly gave us a different table than the one originally selected. It set the tone for the whole meal. Our table service was friendly as well, but on the slow side.   The dessert servings are huge ~ note that you can get a \"half slice!\" Pina colada cake, I'm coming for you. Next time!  Geez! I almost forgot to add one tidbit important to some: it was VERY low-lit on the night we were there.  I don't mind it, but it was a struggle to read the menu. Check out the menu on line to help yourself out if this bugs you. I did have a nice photo opp with a backlit water out of it!"}
{"text":"The food was good but after being at the Naples location there was no comparison. Naples has it hands down on the setup - with the fabulous live entertainment, larger patio area with an open access to the restaurant where the bar is just blows Scottsdale out of the water and I believe the food is one notch better as well."}
{"text":"I did not eat the food here, but we did have two drinks- a mai-tai and a mojito.  They were pretty good.  Although I don't think the bartender muddled the mint in the mojito which is what you're suppoosed to do.  Service was good at the bar and it was surprisingly packed on a Monday in the summer.  I like the view from upstairs.  The building is newer and has a very nice decor for the most part.  I will be back for a drink or two."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch and was pleasantly surprised. The waiter Jene was very good and friendly. We had the Scallop Sliders which were incredible. We also had the crab and avocado salad which also was delicious. Both dishes were very fresh and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I just had lunch with the girlfriends At TB and was pleasantly surprised.  We had a party of 16 chatty women and our server-Derek- treated us like royalty!  He gave descriptive menu recommendations that were spot on.  He managed to keep all of our orders straight, with a number of special requests, and his pacing was spot on. You always worry that service will be sub par with a big group-but Derek never missed a beat.  To top it off I ordered his suggestion, the Chicken Mango Salad-and it was the perfect meal for a hot summer day.  It had sweet, sour, crunchy, yumminess in every savory bite!  I will certainly look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Very nice birthday dinner. Ahi Tacos, Filet and pineapple creme brûlée were excellent as were the tropical drinks."}
{"text":"The service here just was not good. It seemed like the waitress forgot about us.  Then the food just wasn't good. Blackened fish sandwich was hard and the salad just could not get it right."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to the TBs in Naples, FL and Sarasota, FL, and this one in Scottsdale ranks a distant third.  Our waitress, Lulu, was no lemon though.  She was attentive and knew the menu well.  Food was average, and the ambiance was sub par.  Felt cramped and very noisy."}
{"text":"I'm so happy we came here for our dinner on our vacation to Arizona!  The menu was interesting and different and highlighted fresh fish dishes.  The food was yummy and delicious and fresh.     I highly recommend the coconut shrimp appetizer and the scallop sliders!  For entrees, I ordered a crab and avocado salad that was full of lump crab.  Husband ordered shrimp and grits that were hot, spicy and flavorful.  Our college kid ordered grilled shrimp ravioli that I had to keep \"sampling\" :).  The drinks were great, the service was good and the atmosphere of the restaurant- beautiful.   I'll definitely come back next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Took my Mom and other family for Mother's Day. Made reservations and got to the restaurant 5-10 minutes before our designated time. Went to check in at the hostess stand and was rudely informed that I needed to wait. There were 3 employees at the hostess stand, I said I am just here to check in as we had a reservation...was told eventually that the \"table is being cleaned off\" and waited another 10-15 minutes. Really? The booth request was totally disregarded that we had made and instead we were given a table near the front and about 1.5 feet from the next table over. Honestly. I asked about our request and was told nope. No apologies. Wow. Service was horrible...no drink refills, no extra loaf of bread even though our food took an hour to arrive and when it did it was cold and incorrect. We were told to understand because the kitchen was really busy and overwhelmed? Honestly. The entire experience was so bad that we will not go back for a while or maybe not even ever."}
{"text":"Tommy has become our favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. Not only is the food great, but the atmosphere and staff are FANTASTIC. Chris, is an amazing server - and has a great song to intro the deserts, Brenda is also a fantastic server, and their manager Chad is also awesome. And, did I mention their Mai Tai's - best ones outside of Trader Vics. My wife and I really LOVE this place."}
{"text":"Disappointment, like a McCormick and Schimcks but not as good. I was very disappointed from the awkward server to the food that was just a bit above  Applebee's. The bar downstairs will fool you on the ambiance upstairs that is not as good"}
{"text":"Love all things Tommy Bahama! I am a beach style person, grew up at the shore so this place makes me feel right at home! Great staff and great menu options! Recommend to anyone for a great atmosphere and a fun night out"}
{"text":"The 4 stars is because of the wait staff...crab cake appetizers were mushy (the waiter did warn us), also had the coconut shrimp and chicken lollipops which were ok. We were a party of 6, team/work dinner. I picked the restaurant based on Yelp reviews. Dinner entrees were 4 satisfied and 2 not so much and sadly they were the Skirt Steak 'special' menu item. Both complained that the steak was tough (so disappointed that food was left on plate). Bok choy was an odd side dish and cole slaw was everywhere...accompanied 2 of the appetizers and 1 entree. It was tasty but a lot was wasted. Dessert was had by 3 and the pineapple creme brulee was the winner. Grateful we were advised that small portions were available.  Bar area was so crowded when making way to restroom and exit I'm surprised it's not a fire hazard with all the weaving and bobbing that was necessary. This was on a Wed after 5pm, can only imagine a Fri night."}
{"text":"This is a great place to dine for a casual night out.  We had made reservations and were seated immediately.  The food was very good.  I would highly recommend trying several appetizers to share, especially the quesadilla and the ahi tuna tacos.  You will also have to save room for dessert...we had the pina colada cake and it was light and good enough to share.  On the down side, service can be slow at times.  Overall, it was still a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Love Tommy Bahama's food.  I've never had a bad meal here.  The fish dishes are especially awesome and all of their appetizers are delicious and perfect for sharing.  They have an interesting drinks menu with a strong island theme - and their bartenders really make great drinks (including some fun non-alcoholic options like the mint and basil lemonade).    Their plantain chips (if you're a banana fan) should not be missed - they're a delicious side... as is their cauliflower.  My only complaint is that if they are busy - the service is slow and frequently it takes a long time for drink refills and anything you need with your meal (i.e. nobody 'checks' on you and how your meal is going once they take your initial order... they just get the food out to you).    Food rocks!"}
{"text":"I'm very appreciative to the management at Tommy Bahama addressing the noise level of this location. I recently dined here again for a date night with hubby and it's difference between night and day. We chose to sit outside because weather was beautiful and they also had live music. It was so nice and romantic. The noise level was perfect. When I went inside to use the restroom, I noticed it was pleasant inside as well.  Our waiter was also very attentive and knew what we needed even before we knew it ourselves. Did I mention the food? It's amazing. I always wonder how they get their chicken so juicy and moist with perfect seasoning. I highly recommend every single dish here; can't go wrong. Sometimes I order couple appetizers instead of a meal. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks and a very attentive knowledgeable staff. The bartenders are very experienced and make the drinks perfect time after time. They also have a Great Happy Hour everyday from 3-6 including Great drink and appetizer specials. Overall a very well run restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely spectacular food and if you sit at the bar I highly recommend Carl! He's a phenomenal bartender with a personality to match. Try the Key Lime Martini, you won't regret it. Cheers."}
{"text":"Came here on Sat June 10, 2017 for happy hour with a travel MeetUp, before attending the Kierland concert Chuck e Baby.  Seating was very crowded.  Nine of us sat upstairs.  Server did come and ask me what I wanted to drink in a timely fashion. I said glass of ice (water was already on the table) and lemon wedges and several packets of Sweet n Low (I always make my own lemonade).  I did not place any food order at that time.    Lemon and ice came about 15 min later, but not the Sweet n low.  I had to ask 3 times, 3 different people for the Sweet and Low.  Hey, I wanna drink my water!    My food order was the $7 pork belly sliders (2).  The pork was the size of a Pink Pearl eraser (remember those?) in each slider, with pickled veggies (like what you'd find in Vietnamese restaurant sandwich).  It was good, wish the pork belly piece was larger.  3.5 stars.    Having to ask 3 times, 3 different people for my Sweet and low, knocks the stars down, but what really makes me give 2 stars is the place is SO NOISY, YOU CAN'T TALK TO EVEN YOUR NEIGHBOR, SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.  Someone at our table commented that the walls and floors do not absorb sound.  Cos the person sitting directly across from me could not hear what i was saying, I had to stand up, lean over the table and then YELL AT HER!    So if you wanna get together with your friends to \"say something to them\", besides just eat, DO NOT COME HERE!  Maybe sitting outside is better, but I did not sit outside, too hot.    My bill was so slow in coming, everyone else got their bills and paid them already, so I had to go to the counter and ask for my bill.  Someone had to tell my server.  I shouldn't have given her a tip, but she was busy, she was not rude, so I gave her a tip.    Dinner entrees are expensive, so not coming back here.  The Living Room has more appealing happy hour food for less money - Good value!"}
{"text":"Finally visited the remodeled facility. Apart from uncomfortable chairs, not much has changed upstairs. The previous cozy downstairs bar was changed to an enlarged uncomfortable feeding area, with chairs way too low. This newly created industrial atmosphere will stop us from returning. The designer missed what Tommy Bahama is about. Food however was excellent, but over-priced."}
{"text":"So my review is based on the service not the food! I would give a 4 based on food, our waitress was absolutely horrible. She never introduced herself to our table of 4 , did not check on our food , took our leftovers away (which we wanted) and threw them out, did not ask if we wanted desert , did not bring water promptly, had to ask for things multiple times , and even acting annoyed that she was waiting on my family.  On top of that she took forever to bring out check.   The food was very tasty , however I have not been to a restaurant with this bad of service in Scottsdale in a long time. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing bartenders. Me and my mother came on right before closing and they were nice to us even beyond their opening hours."}
{"text":"LOVE the outdoor courtyard but the food isn't worth the hefty price tag, if you ask me. The crab bisque didn't have much flavor. My mango chicken salad had a funky, musky, fishy flavor. I couldn't nail it down but I thought maybe it was a truffle oil (which I like, but not on a salad) but the sever said it was truffle and fish free. Maybe the feta had gone bad?! I hope not!"}
{"text":"We recently went to this restaurant 3 months ago and had horrible service. We decided to give it try again last night. They did a complete 180 with flood and service. We were very please with everything. I would highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"We made an online reservation for happy hour one winter Saturday. We chose to sit outside which was perfectly alright since it was still mid-afternoon and the sun was out. In addition, the restaurant had the patio heaters set up. We got several food items off the happy hour menu. Everything was delicious and nicely-presented. Our favorites were the coconut shrimp, macadamia crusted goat cheese and the burger sliders. The drinks were top-notch too. I then decide that we were going to take the plunge and get dessert. Our waitress brought out all the available desserts that day, which I think was a great idea because it made it easier to decide once we had a visual. We opted for the malted chocolate pie. The moment I laid eyes on it, I couldn't help but cry (inside) with happiness and awe. It was decadent and heavenly.  I recommend dropping by the restaurant and store on a nice, lazy weekend and embracing the tropical vibes of Tommy Bahama!"}
{"text":"I'm not the type to have an imperfect experience then give one star, but maybe I'm super petty when things don't go my way so here goes.  Went on a Saturday afternoon so as expected, was a pretty busy day.  Our server (I wish I could remember her name but there were drinks so...) was super nice and attentive and checked on us often.  Never had an empty glass and she gave good recommendations.  There were 2 issues I had--one was they were out of Tito's.  Kind of confusing as to why on a weekend you wouldn't be overstocked, if anything with popular alcohol for the bar.  Tito's, in my opinion is a frequently ordered vodka choice and one of my personal favorites.  Not a massive dilemma; I didn't cry about it or anything.  The second problem definitely put a damper on my experience.  I ordered the filet mignon salad, and multiple times said absolutely NO dressing and NO vinaigrette.  People call me crazy for that but it's just my preference.  If they really knew me they'd know there are plenty of other reasons to give me that label.  I do not like salad dressing and I loathe vinaigrette--the taste is repellant.  I also know if you put it on a salad it's not like it can be blotted or wiped off to get rid of the taste.  So I made sure to say at least three times to not put any type of dressing or damn vinaigrette on my salad or anywhere on my plate not even on the side.  I don't blame just the server or just the kitchen staff because sometimes the communication between them gets skewed and confusing but of course there was f-ing vinaigrette on my salad.  Ugh!  We didn't have a lot of time at that point so I ate just the steak pieces and the potatoes since they hadn't drenched those parts in the disgusting yuckygrette.  The pieces of filet were absolutely delicious and cooked exactly as requested.  I wouldn't touch the salad which sucked because I thought the filet would pair well with the rest of the salad as that's the reason I ordered it-duh--and If I had more time I would have sent it back but shit, I mean, what I asked for equals less work--I said to NOT include something so you'd think it may be easier but who cares when you're not paying attention and you're not the one disappointed, right?  Ah well, I probably won't be back because of that and as small of an issue as it seems, I don't care; if you can't NOT put vinaigrette on my food after asking several times, then I equate that in my head as you having Cartman swagger (\"I do what I want, I do what I want\") and giving me the finger."}
{"text":"I went yesterday with friends for one my friend birthday also with her dad and his fiancé the waiter was fantastic and the service was great and the food was delicious I would definitely go back again oh the dessert was fantastic as well"}
{"text":"Always a friendly place with great food and drink. A bit expensive for my personal tastes but a great place for business.  Will be back the next time I am up in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"So let me first say the ambiance of this restaurant is great! Typical Tommy Bahama feel being a laid back tropical vacation. The drink I had was a mango habanero margarita and it was alright...there wasn't much of a tequila flavor. It was overall a weird combo but refreshing at the same time. I then had a grilled shrimp Cobb salad and it was not good...there was no flavor anywhere on the dish. I may or may not come back depending on the amount of alcohol I drank beforehand."}
{"text":"Highly highly overrated.  Quality of food was below mediocre. Everything was sweet tasting and over priced. Service was slow and the drinks were horrible. The best part about it was the steel drum player."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite line of clothes, love the the casual feel, yet class of smooth silk and durability.  Living in Arizona, can wear it as a dressy casual and to nicer events.   As far as the restaurant is concerned,  have eaten here twice and love the feel that compliments the feel of their clothing line, it is like you are eating in the tropical islands of Hawaii or the Caribbean.   Tried the World Famous Coconut Shrimp, Carribean Rubbed Mahi Mahi and Shrimp Miso Ramen. The World Famous Coconut Shrimp is very well prepared, crispy yet not dry and accompied with a dipping sauce. As far as World Famous .....The Mahi Mahi is very tender and fresh served on a bed of Quinoa Succotash which compliments the dish well. The Shrimp Miso Ramen had a good number of shrimp, but the Miso style soup base just did not hit the spot. Being spoiled by Ramen from CA, this is \"lo-fon\" style.  I would stay with the Seafood and the sandwiches and you will have a good experience,  restaurant is nice and casual yet the high end side."}
{"text":"Ehh.  Average food.  Fun tropical atmosphere, however."}
{"text":"Whoever decorated this place did a great job!  You walk in and feel like you're on vacation.  Sadly, I've had a few bad experiences with the staff.  The worst of it is that the waitress just forgets to come back.  It always takes a while from start to finish (compared to other restaurants).  I hate to say it, but everything is over-priced as well.  You can get the same quality of food and drink (and better service for that matter) at almost any of the other restaurants in Kierland.  All 4 times I've eaten there, I've walked away still hungry and wondering why I paid so much."}
