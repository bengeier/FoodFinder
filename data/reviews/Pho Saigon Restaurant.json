{"text":"Those who actually gave this place a 3-5 star rating have absolutely no idea what real pho broth taste like 
Went here and ordered the special pho 

Then broth wasn't hot enough,lacking flavour as all it tasted like was a bowl of warm water,salt msg 

I can definitely tell the owner is not viet as this wasn't a true viet authentic style pho that I've had other places

Even their vermicelli with sausage was bad 

Def won't be back I had no other choice for pho as this was the only spot in the area when I was there"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us and now I recommend it to you!  The food is out of this world delicious.  Its a bit of a hole in the wall, its clean its nice it isnt fancy but wow is it tasty!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Pho is ok. Not the greatest. Wouldn't waste my money here again. One of the owners (blonde woman) is extremely rude and needs a  refresh course in customer service. You would think that being a business owner you would be more polite to your customers. After All we are what helps your business thrive. Oh well."}
{"text":"Below average pho restaurant in the GTA. Their owners are cheap. Wooden disposal chopsticks were given to dine in customers and their pho didn't come with any of the typical garnishes such as green onions - which don't cost very much. Their pho is also $1 more than most comparable restaurants."}
{"text":"Went to this place because of convenience, but there are many better places that are worth travelling to. The service was mediocre at first, then became extremely terrible. When we were sitting down and about to order, our waiter decided to say one minute and leave to clean another table and attend to other customers. I found this extremely unprofessional and rude. 

Next the food. The broth was not as flavourful as other places, nor was the beef. The portion was good however, I'd rather a smaller portion of flavourful and tasty food than a large portion of flavourless. If you're in the area and would like to eat here, I'm not saying pass it completely, but just expect less so you aren't disappointed.

I'd also like to add that the price of the pho here is higher than your usual pho place which ironically serves better pho. I say change the dollar sign to $$"}
{"text":"Ordered a house special large pho and a fresh pork & shrimp spring roll to share with my boyfriend for a quick dinner. Pho portion and the spring rolls were decently sized so I would definitely come here again since I live in Scarborough. I only wish that the fresh spring rolls came with fish sauce to dip in instead of the one they offer."}
{"text":"Went there the other night to celebrate the firing of Chris Nutall-Smith from the Globe & Mail. I'm so glad they got rid of that hyphenated pseudo upper class twit. Anyway it was time for a bowl of pho. We also had mango salad, fried tofu and their deep fried spring rolls, everything was served fresh and hot. Service was prompt, friendly and professional. The pho came after our apps, it was very good with nice tasty broth that was not over seasoned. Portions are very generous, I ordered a large pho and couldn't finish it cuz it wuz so big. I took it home and finished it at breakfast. Very enjoyable meal, will go again soon."}
{"text":"I can always count on Pho Saigon for fast delicious vietnamese food. They have a reasonable vegetarian menu and all of it tastes great (TIP: Make sure to ask for vegetable broth! Most of the broth is chicken).

Four stars only because they take a while to give you your bill and you have to plan your trip to the restaurant based on how busy you think the parking lot may be. Weekends are busy in the plaza because of the flea market."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!! This pho is great, I don't know all that much about vietnemese food but the beef pho here really hit the spot. 
I went in last night for take out, got the brisket pho (medium) and my food was ready by the time I paid. 
I got TONS of food, it came with a huge container of broth, tons of beef, bean sprouts, basil, chilies in a little container, and a huge heap of noodles. I don't really know what the other people meant by dry noodles but my were moist when I received them w/ the meat on the side. 
I got through about 1/3rd before I gave in. For 7 bucks I'd say it's a pretty SWEET deal."}
{"text":"Awesome place overall. I wasn't a big fan of pho until I went here. It's cheap as well. Make sure you order the rice + chicken combo with the fish sauce!!"}
{"text":"Typical pho joint except the decor was bit more modern.  The staff were friendly.  

Reasonable prices for decent tasting food.  The pho was bit too salty and wished for a bit more meat."}
{"text":"Canteen food, average taste. MSG. Bean Sprouts not fresh. Sad place, depressive. Dirty ceiling. 
Ok for regular Vietnamese families. Not a favorite. I do not know if I will give them another chance to prove contrary. 
Pro: not so expensive, but is slightly higher than average per dish. I prefer to pay more and have better food and service. 
Anyway, because of sad faces of the servers I offered 20% tip."}
{"text":"I love a good soup.. I had ordered takeout from this spot before and the grilled chicken Pho soup was recommended. When i got home and started eating i realized the grilled chicken wasn't for me. A bit to fatty and a few knuckles are not my cup of soup. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't that disappointed as it was just a recommendation. The soup was great besides the grilled chicken. I went in today and ordered the Thai curry chicken # 67 i believe? It was amazing! The portion size would cater to anyone's hanger. I didn't finish it all but did my best. Friendly staff and great prices. I also noted that the washrooms were being taken care of properly... Nice and clean. I know quite a few people who eat at this spot and, i have never heard anything bad. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Good pho place. Good food, friendly service, always a good experience. Pricing is slightly higher than average per dish."}
{"text":"My go-to spot for pho since its close to work. Very consistent food...always on point. Good portions but slightly over priced for pho compared to other places. 

I've never had anything else other than pho but it's about what you'd expect...good portions. Good value and always consistent. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Average pho joint. I always get the rare beef noodle soup. The medium is quite large but the broth remains hot and delicious. Stay away from the Thai spring rolls unless u love sesame oil. Vegetable spring rolls are just average."}
{"text":"Really like this Pho restaurant and their portion sizes are well worth it at reasonable prices (Not expensive at all). My family and I came here as our last stop from a road trip that day and I can assure you that it was the best pit stop after hours of driving. We were so hungry and tired so this definitely fulfilled our hunger and revitalized our system. Pho never ceases to disappoint me! Service was pretty good too."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have had the following:

Deep Fried Tofu over Vermicelli 
Spring Rolls over Vermicelli (the spring rolls are vegetarian)
Mango Milkshake
Strawberry Milkshake

The deep fried tofu dish is simple, yet so yummy. The tofu is nice and crunchy.The dish also has cucumber, carrot, peanuts,  green onions, vermicelli and daikon. If you are vegetarian, this is the dish for you. I actually think that the deep fried tofu tastes better than the spring roll version. I am glad that they have a few veggie items on the menu.  I was thinking of trying the veggie red or green curry next time. The serving size is always the perfect amount. 

The milkshakes are the best! It is not overly sweet and they use real ripe fruit. Highly recommended. 

I am a regular customer and I find the service is really good. Overall, I give this place an A+."}
{"text":"This was my favourite place for Pho. I especially loved the pork vermicelli with spring roll. So I was disappointed when I ate there a couple of weeks ago. The price has gone up but the food has gone downhill. The spring rolls used to be light and crispy. The one I had was oily. It tasted like it had been reheated in a microwave. The vermicelli was undercooked. The dish used to have fresh cilantro but there was none to be seen. The decor and service have never been especially good, but the food used to more than make up for it. I'm going to hope this was just a bad day and try them one more time. I couldn't help but notice that it wasn't nearly as busy as I'm used to. (I've been eating here over the last five years)"}
{"text":"As someone else noted here: the pho broth is average. Not the best, but it won't kill you. (But that's not exactly a glowing endorsement, is it?)

The pho prices are higher than you'd expect in a Vietnamese place: $8-$9 for a large to extra large.

The service was underwhelming: While my three co-diners had already been served, I was still waiting for my pho. I saw the two waitresses standing at the front counter talking, so I knew they had forgotten my order. (Doesn't a good server look over at a table and wonder why 3/4 of the diners are eating, and 1 isn't?) I asked if my pho was coming. If you know how easy it is for a restaurant to cook pho (the big pot of broth is already simmering, and they just have to add already-soaked noodles + meat), then you know that the only explanation for the pho to be coming after the grilled items is because they simply forgot. When one of the waitresses came back with my order two minutes later, she didn't offer any kind of apology or explanation.

Do yourself a favour and cross the street to Spring 'n Fresh Rolls on Warden Ave. (east side). The pho is tastier, is less expensive, and the service is better."}
{"text":"May 2018 Update

The food is good as always, waiters/waitresses are still hospitable; however, the food has skyrocketed in price (in the double digits for all pho sizes, combos, 4 spring rolls, etc.)"}
{"text":"I sometimes lunch here and always order pho with chicken #74. Service is good. Food is consistently yummy.  Parking is sometimes a challenge but still worth the trouble."}
{"text":"Very quick service. Friendly staff. Your typical Pho House but the kicker is that their pho soup is SO good. Nothing can compare. We can it at around 4pm - just a few hours before the dinner rush - and it was not busy. 

I always get a house special when I get pho and the house special here is so good! I'm definitely going to come back."}
{"text":"This place is my hubby's and my tried and true go-to for a simple and tasty meal. We find the service is fast with the charm of a family-run joint and the food is reliable and comforting. Unfortunately the parking lot is pretty crazy on weekend afternoons for lunch though."}
{"text":"Decent Vietnamese food. Summer (fresh) rolls were better than the spring (fried) rolls. Beef pho broth was good and light, but the beef itself had a slightly weird flavour. Would eat here again if I needed some Vietnamese in a pinch, otherwise I'll stick to my regular pho place."}
{"text":"Average pho restaurant. Not the best in Scarborough as Pho Metro is a strong competitor. Since we didn't want to be disappointed with a bowl of pho, we opted for grilled chicken with vermicelli and spring roll and an old classic grilled pork chop/chicken on rice. Both dishes tasted pretty decent and portions were adequate. I must give credit to the cleanliness and the service of the restaurant. Overall, it was average for this part of Scarborough."}
{"text":"I use to frequent Pho Saigon years ago when I use to live in the area because there weren't many places to eat Pho in Scarborough 10 years ago.

This past Saturday, I decided to drop by for a bowl of Pho before seeing a movie.
The place was quite busy but that doesn't necessarily reflect the quality of food or the exorbitant prices.

I ordered a small Pho Dac Biet which is essentially the special that includes everything ($7.75 for a small) and my friend ordered a Pho Tai Gan which is rare beef with tendon ($7.75 for a small). 

The Pho Dac Biet was a really mediocre bowl of pho that had quite a bit of msg. They also skimped on the tripe and beef balls. My friend's Pho Tai Gan also had quite a bit of msg and was essentially void of any tendon.

Pho Saigon is probably one of the higher priced Vietnamese restaurants in the city and I have been to the majority of Vietnamese restaurants in the city and they seem to skimp on items as mentioned above. Your essentially paying a very high price for a  very average bowl of Pho. A small bowl of Pho at one of the better Vietnamese restaurants in the city located in the west end goes for around $6.

The service was mediocre, the server missed items but they were somewhat quick to rectify anything they had missed.

Also, one criteria I usually use in telling how good and authentic a Vietnamese restaurant is by seeing how many Vietnamese people/families frequent the establishment. From my experience, not many Vietnamese people frequent Pho Saigon and I think some people who have mentioned a lot of Vietnamese people eating at Pho Saigon are confusing Vietnamese people with Filipino people."}
{"text":"I really like this place because there's a lot of meat in the house special pho.  The food does not disappoint.

They do not have the utensils sitting on the table, they bring it to you with your soup.  They do not have a small cup on the table (to put the oyster sauce/hot sauce), you have to ask for it.

I think Pho Saigon has decent prices in comparison to the pho places around the same area.  The food is good, the place is clean and inviting. There's also parking in the back and front of the building. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Average food. Service was not very good. I was here for a lunch meeting. I would prob not come back"}
{"text":"Went here again and the pho was still excellent, however, the service was terrible.  I swear it was everyone's first day.  

Ingredients the pho I ordered:
1. noodles
2. raw beef
3. tendon

Pho Saigon attempt #1:
1. noodles
2. flank
3. tendon

Pho Saigon attempt #2:
1. noodles
2. raw beef
3. tripe

What the hell?  Not only did it take about 15 minutes for everyone's pho to come out, with the two errors on my order, everyone was done their lunch before I started.  I hate to penalize Vietnamese joints for service, but they must know that a lunch clientele have time restrictions!"}
{"text":"This place used to be really great. Key word. Used to be. I've vowed not to come back here anymore ever since discovering other Pho places that make this place look sad. If I do come here, it's always last resort. Every time we order Pho, the portions are ridiculously sad. Their house special pho is disappointing, there tiny pcs of meat and a whole lotta noodle and lots of soup. We've even ordered a XL once and it just had more soup in it same portion size as a medium/large. They're just not worth going to. I'd rather go eat Mc Donalds."}
{"text":"The waiters look MISERABLE there. No joke. 
The food was okay, a bit overprice than usual nothing fantastic. 
My brother ordered pho and he said the broth was a bit sour.

But seriously, when I went the waiters looked like they really hated life. Esp the Tibetan one!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very crowded in terms of their layout. They have seatings for eight, which makes it difficult for the waiter to get the bowl to the person in the middle. I find the pho here tastes cleaner than typical joints probably because there's no MSG. I think after reading reviews and seeing what others ordered, the rice & vermicelli dishes are probably what you should order here instead of the pho. Also, in terms of competitive pricing, 10$ for spring rolls seems a little high in my opinion. I believe pho 88 price is around 7.50?"}
{"text":"I remember the first time my husband and I ate at this restaurant: it was freezing cold outside and we were starving. New to Canada at the time, we had no clue where to eat. We were at the Salvation Army Thrift store when we both thought, a nice hot steaming bowl of pho would be good right about now. Lo and behold, Pho Saigon happened to be in the same plaza.

Several months later and after a number of follow-up visits, I found myself having a quiet lunch alone. I looked around and I was surprised that I didn't notice the beautiful artwork and decor scattered throughout the restaurant. The owner told me that her branch in Pickering is even better and is a more formal sit down restaurant; however, this site is her \"baby\" (first restaurant) so you'll find her here most often.

Stellar customer service during the day (can't say the same for the night shift) when the owner is there! I grilled the younger female waitress about dishes I was unfamiliar with and she had an answer for everything. The waitresses would periodically check in on me; but if I needed something, all I had to do was look around (no waving your hand around or yelling \"excuse me\") and one of the waitresses would come to my table. One instance a waitress was in the kitchen and the other was with another customer; I happened to look at the owner (personable Portuguese woman with spiky blond hair who mans the cash register) and she knew to call one of the waitresses to check on me. A++ in my book!

As far as the food, the Pho and Vermicelli dishes are solid picks; I wouldn't recommend the shrimp paste in sugar cane (chewy and the sugar cane wasn't sweet), nor the meatballs (chewy and hard)."}
{"text":"I came here during the winter looking for some hot pho to warm me up. I ordered the beef meatball pho and mango bubble tea. It wasn't the best pho I've ever had, but it wasn't the worst either, just average. It's a convenient location and if you're in the area and need something more than just starbucks, eat here."}
{"text":"This was delish.  We stopped in this evening, and I ordered the vermicelli with spring roll, shrimp paste and pork something or other.  It was really really tasty.  We started with some fresh shrimp rolls, which were also delish.

My DC ordered the rice with chicken and beef and was delighted.  
Recommended!"}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise after my recent traumatic experience at the nearby Pho restaurant -- by traumatic I meant food of course.

The Pho here can definitely hold it's own. The broth is clear and flavourful but somewhat lacking in depth and complexity when compared to the elites. The prices are slightly more expensive than others but they more than make up for it with their serving sizes. Their large Pho had an exorbitant amount of noodles and enough meat to last you to the end (which is extremely rare). What I really did enjoy was the care they had in their selection of meats. The cuts of beef are all above average grade and their grill meats are prepared very well.

All in all a great place to stop by for your pho fix!"}
{"text":"Ordered for pickup via telephone today. The woman who took the order was unbelievable rude when I had to change my order while I was making it. She said \"Now I have to cancel the order,\" sighed, and hung up. How is it an inconvenience to take an order from a paying customer? This person represents the restaurant and it is unfortunate that they can't even do that right. Once getting the food home, it was tasteless and awful. Never again."}
{"text":"I probably wander into this place every couple of months for lunch takeout or a quick sit down lunch. It's a solid three in my opinion. Clean restaurant, good food, fast takeout. A creature of habit, I'm all about the vermicelli with chicken and spring roll. Hard to screw that up.

I really would prefer to find chopsticks rather than a fork in my tied up bag when I get back to the office to eat it though. I get chopsticks when I eat in."}
{"text":"My friend recommended me this place about 2 years ago. Looking at the reviews, I probably should've tried this restaurant 2 years ago and not last week.

I ordered the stewed beef pineapple and carrot rice noodle soup, while my dad ordered the bun bo hue. It was okay...normally the stewed beef noodle soup would come with a tomato-like soup base, but there was a lack of that taste. My dad liked the bun bo hue, but told me he's had better (Kim Po).

This restaurant probably has some of the cleanest washrooms I've seen for an authentic Vietnamese restaurant. Vietnamese restaurants aren't known for clean washrooms (in fact I think they are some of the worst in that field), but this one was very clean. In fact, you get your own stall for the urinal in the men's washroom; something you don't see in most other restaurants.

Service was poor. The waitress we had was not very knowledgeable of the menu, and had to repeatedly ask another waitress about questions we had. Perhaps she was someone new?

I can't see myself coming back here unless I'm in the area and want Vietnamese food. It is the only Pho area in the Golden Mile neighbourhood as far as I know."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place for pho. Especially in this area. Sizes and prices are average. Wait staff are a bit sluggish and the place seems to be owned by an old mid eastern couple. Usually gets pretty full at dinner time. We also had the calamari appetizer which was good."}
{"text":"I have lived in Scarborough for a long time but never been here.

Decent vegetarian red curry and rice ($9). I was told that the curries do not have fish sauce. 

Service was pretty good and they even helped us with a high chair."}
{"text":"Food was great but we waited forever! We sat down (4 of us) when the restaurant was nearly empty and after waiting about 30 minutes they only brought out mine! After about 15 more minutes they bought out 2 more then finally about 5 more minutes for the last. Not happy with the service at all!"}
{"text":"Pho noodles were overcooked and my soup came with a free ladybug. Given the amount of pho shops in the area, I probably would not head back here."}
{"text":"Very bland pho.  Satay was on the side.  Big bowl with not much stuff.  Tea was just hot water.  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Been passing by this place for years since its near the movie theaters but never went in.  So i decided to give it a chance.  Not a good experience here, services was poor.

As we walking in, the restaurant was at most quarter full, but they herded us like sheep's and stuck  all the customers in 1 small corner while the other 3 quarters of the restaurant was empty.  The tables in the corner was very tight, you could hear everyone talk.  Waiter didn't want to talk to us, just pointed at a table that wasn't even cleaned yet.  And then, no tea was served to us, had to flag a waiter down for tea and it took 10 minutes.

Food wasn't that good, was kind of tasteless and the meats were too chewy.  Prices were also about 2 dollars more than other pho places.

All through the meal we were just looking at the other partsof the empty restaurant, why couldn't they spread us out a little more.

Would not go back, terrible service, waiters that hate their life, and tasteless overpriced food."}
{"text":"No MSG!!

Good broth. Was here on a Mon evening. Good service. No complaints. It is almost impossible to find a Pho restaurant that doesn't use MSG & I know because I am extremely sensitive to it. The lemongrass grilled pork was delicious & it was one of the best I've had. I reccomend them for a nice bowl of Pho if you are in the Warden & Eglinton area.

Yay for no MSG!!"}
{"text":"It's not my favourite pho experience, but it will do if I'm in Scarborough and I'm in need of noodles.  Wherever I go, I always order Bun with chicken and a spring roll because the soup never sits right... MSG allergy foils my options.  The bun's not bad here, but at close to $9 for a small serving, it's more expensive than better bun I've had elsewhere.  

The service is okay, but I have had to wait a few occasions longer than I deemed reasonable."}
{"text":"Good place for pho. Great for lunch. I used to work in the area. Its cheap and filling. Fairly tasty. 

Meal for under $7"}
{"text":"Based on my experiences with similar places in the past I got pretty much what I expected. Cozy ambience, good portion soup, reasonably priced and pretty satisfying to the taste buds. Ordered a Pho soup with Grilled Chicken. The soup was nothing extraordinary. It was pretty much what I was expecting. But what I liked was how the grilled chicken was offered. I was expecting a blandish sort of Chicken but what came was a nice and flavourful plate of grilled chicken that I chose to half enjoy as a side dish and dump the remaining half into my soup."}
{"text":"Pho Saigon Restaurant is ok as a Pho Joint! But I don't think I would have go out of the way to have a bowl of Pho here.

I was here for lunch on a weekday afternoon. This restaurant was quite busy. Most of the patrons were not Asians.. haha... I did stood out like a sore thumb! 

I decided on a medium Pho with rare beef. It arrived quickly but I was not offered any bean sprouts. My pho just got dumped on my table and I have to wave another waiter down in order to get my bean sprout/basil/chili pepper. BTW I don't think any of the other tables was offered fresh chili, he has to go inside the kitchen to look for it!

The broth is nice and flavoured with a lot of depth. The rare beef were a little cooked... but still ok. But here the medium is like a size of small compare to Vietnam Noodle Star.. and that is quite pricey for $7. The noodle is also a dried type.

They accepts Visa, Mastercard and Interac."}
{"text":"I've had the rare beef pho and my husband had the grilled pork vermicelli.  My pho was good, however, I've had more flavorful pho with larger portions of meat at other restaurants. My husband also felt that the meat portion is smaller here than at other Vietnamese restaurants. I will still grab the pho on a chilly day as it is a good option. I will try some of their other pho options next time. I've been told that the grilled beef noodle soup is quite good."}
{"text":"Top quality food and service if you are looking for the best pho in town. The staff are kind and nice but the prices are very high. Expect to spend 15-20 dollars on a meal to feel pho. There are better prices around town such as Giner and Pho 88 up at Warden and steeles but the quality isn't as great as this. They almost have the best soup in town if you ask my opinion."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Been here a few times and have always been happy. After last night will never go again. Took forever to get food and when I asked about our appetizer fresh rolls they got offended because I was unhappy to get our mains before our apps. Hostess tried to blame it on the new chef and due to our ordering everything at once. They waitress had an attitude that won't be forgiven. The fresh rolls that we got seemed none to fresh either. More like last nights rolls. Good thing there are lots of Vietnamese restaurants around for me to give my business to."}
{"text":"worst pho ever!!!!!!! i have tried a lot of pho and this one by far is soooo disgusting. overly salty broth no authrntic vietnamese flavour!!!! i went there today ordered a large pho took 2 sips payed and left...absolutely disgusting and a waste of money. please do not spend your money at this restaurant. also inside looks dirty very nasty pho noodle soup!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Count on enjoying this place; clean, fast, delicious and incredible value. Very friendly management."}
