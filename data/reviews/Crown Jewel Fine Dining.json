{"text":"We came at 1:30pm on Saturday and the tables were not filled. We had excellent service compared to many other Chinese restaurants. The dim sum dishes were very good. Above average. This was the first time we ate there."}
{"text":"White walls, cheap carpet, flood lights instead of chandeliers.  This is a Crown Jewel? Way too crowded, restaurant was like sitting in a can of sardines under a heat lamp.  Unfortunately the food was also like the environment.. Tasteless and disappointing.  Perhaps the restaurant is not quite ready?"}
{"text":"Came here tonight with a table full of doctors at a drug company sponsored dinner, on a quiet tuesday night so you'd think the kitchen would put their best effort into it.  Unfortunately, the food is very lackluster.  We had probably a 12 course meal, and while I was completely stuffed at the end and could only eat a bite or two of the later courses, there was not one single memorable dish I could recommend (including all the various seafood dishes we had)."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE!!!!! My family was driving around north york looking for a place or a quick dinner, and figured we should try this restaurant. Right of the bat, they completely dis regarded us and took the names of the people behind us just because they spoke chinese. Afterwards, we ordered peking duck and some other dishes, which took 30 minutes to get to us. We were actually about to leave when we saw a whole duck be wheeled to our table. There is no way it shouldve taken 30 min to get a duck off the rack with pancakes. When i wanted to express my concern for our long wait, the manager didnt acknowledge me or apologize for the delay. None of our other orders also didnt arrive, which makes me wonder. One of the worst dining experiences ever, and try and avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Service was amazing!  For a Chinese restaurant, got to say we got so much TLC.  Food is decent, order food before 11am, the M and L dishes are the same price as a S dish.  For those with msg problem, this place is packed with it, but presentation of the food was great!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner! Good service and great food!!  The pervious staff were rude! I'm glad they changed the people!!!"}
{"text":"Newly opened Crown Jewel Fine Dining has replaced the former Sam Woo Seafood.  A dim sum and Chinese food restaurant,   There is still some renovation work required on the premises, but they are open for business now.  Tried their dim sum which was competent...we liked that every dish came out very hot.  They have early bird pricing before 11 am.  A nice successor to Sam Woo Seafood which was one of our previous favorites in the area.  We will return to sample more of their dishes."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for chinese new years dinner and lets just say their service at this restaurant does not even deserve 1 star. We had a reservation for two full tables at 6 pm. When we arrived there were maybe 4 or 5 tables so I thought service would be good. Wrong. Servers were rude and did not give you the experience one high end chinese restaurant should. Portions of dishes have increasingly become smaller and smaller (definitely not worth it for the price we pay). The worst of it all is that the manager was cleaning our dishes and he flicked soya sauce all over my shirt! I was furious and no appology was provided. Worst service ever. Will definitely not return"}
{"text":"It's a decently sized restaurant and there were lots of people here for dim sum.  I really appreciated their service here as I found the staff to be courteous and more polite than some other Chinese dim sum restaurants."}
{"text":"I like the fact that we didn't have to wait for a table on a late Saturday morning. Probably because other restaurants have deals for ordering before 11:00am. Not here. So, price conscious Chinese would come here out of necessity or convenience. We were the latter camp.   The food was average and in my opinion slightly over priced.   We entertained the set menu for dinner at just under $500, but it lacked the wow factor for that price. We'll return someday for dinner and order off menu and see how that fares."}
{"text":"Not bad, but I've definitely had better. Portions were not bad. Highlight was their Crown Jewel BBQ pork buns. The bun was pillowy and the sugar crust on the outside was a nice touch. However, it could have done with a lot more BBQ pork on the inside. Very little filling. The braised pork hock with peanuts is tasty as well, but pricey for the portion.  They do have some kind of early bird special before 11, but you probably want to get there quite a bit before 11, because they do tend to have a line up."}
{"text":"I came here on a thursday morning and was quite surprised with the quality. I came here before and the dim sum here was just meh. Nothing really stood out but taste wasn't excellent or bad either. However this time around I thought the food wasn't bad for the price. Monday-sunday before 11:00 am, dim sum is $3.10 for s/m/l. Food came out hot and fresh. Tea price is $1.20/person. I really enjoyed the chive and shrimp pancake. It was fried so crispily. I came into the restuarant right when it opened, so they lacked staff. It was hard to wave down the staff, but when they were around, they were quite tendative. The place is quite clean and decoration is somewhat modern."}
{"text":"I would give this place NO STARS if I could. We've been sitting here for an hour and counting waiting for our order to show up. It's pretty busy in here but all the tables are full of people just waiting for their food to arrive. Every time you follow up with the waiters they just say it's coming really fast. If you come on a Friday/Saturday/Sunday you can forget about it. I do not recommend anyone wasting their time here."}
{"text":"??warden?steels???plaza?????????????????????????????????????????????????????d????????????????????????????????d??????????"}
{"text":"This place has a decent price for the dim sum in Toronto, but compared to Chicago (where I'm from) the dim sum is a bit cheaper. The dim sum specifically the sui mei which contained black caviar on top was the best i ever tasted in sui mei dim sum."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here since before I was born. We've stayed with them this whole time from when it used to be called Sam Woo and have gone through many changes in ownership.  It was \"renovated\" recently in that it changed hands again. Interior looks the exact same but the biggest difference was the food. We went for dim sum. It wasn't great but not bad.. but it wasn't really to our tastes given what we were used to. Some things got better  (the bbq pork buns were great - juicy inside with a soft fluffy bun) and other things were worse.  Then we went for dinner. The experience would have been two stars but I'm giving it three for sentimental reasons. We spent $600 ish for about 20 people and all of us agreed that the meal was quite unsatisfying given the quality of food and we probably won't come back until it changes hands again. Nothing really stood out and some things were downright bad. The fried oysters for instance. literally just huge fried oysters and it looked so unappetizing that no one at our table ate it. Fried noodles were served at the end when it should be e-fun and they were mediocre. The beef with maggi sauce got worse because they use lower quality beef now. It used to be so soft and tender, now it's really hard to chew and not as flavorful. The worst was the peking duck. The duck was fine but the wrap was horrible. What should be fluffy and soft and light was soggy and chewy and broke apart as we were trying to eat it. they've always done Peking duck well and it's my favorite so it was really sad. It just seems like cost cutting everywhere.  the one saving grace was their sweet and sour pork. Still the best in Toronto I feel. It comes out hot, is crispy but when you bite in the meat is still tender. Perfect balance of sweet and sour.   again, we've gone through many changes in ownership but it was never a bad change. This time though, we're keeping some distance."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday afternoon at about 12:00 for dim sum (Family Day holiday). There was a small line up, but it was only about a 5 minute wait. The service was really fast. Right after ordering the food started arriving within a few minutes. All the food was pretty average though. Nothing really worth mentioning but nothing to really complain about either.   Overall, its a decent place to grab some dim sum"}
{"text":"I often come to this place with my grandma. Close to home and also they have early bird special. If you come before 11, all small, medium, and large dim sum is the same price. The problem is actually getting a seat at 11. So I suggest go 30 mins earlier. You'll most likely get your order in before 11.   The dishes are all pretty good. Not over priced okay for a normal weekend dim sum. Get the special pineapple bun also."}
{"text":"Came here because the line up for dim sum at Crown Prince was ridiculous.  Ended up finding a place that's not too bad for dim sum.  Pros: Nice Decor Staff is pretty friendly  Cons: Prices are a little high Dim Sum is just OK  When we first came in, we were surprised not to see a line up at all during the early bird special.  Usually most dim sum places are jam packed before 11am.  We were seated almost immediately.  The restaurant is pretty bright and spacious.  The restaurant was full but never over flowing at any given time.  Like most newer dim sum places you order from a sheet and then they bring it out to you after.  The dim sum comes out fast which is pretty good.  I found the dim sum pretty average.  Nothing horrible but nothing really special either.  The prices are a little high for early bird.  It has gone up since Jennifer K reviewed this place.  S, M, L are all $2.90 now during early bird hours.  For $2.90 you expect a little more.  The staff were very friendly and fast for the most part.  Any concession we needed for our little one was met with a smile and promptly attended too.  This is a place I can see myself going back to when I'm craving dim sum in a hurry.  There are other places I prefer but I wouldn't hesitate to come to Crown Jewel if the opportunity arises."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant for dinner, great value for the quality. I personally prefer their dinner service, Dim Sum sometimes could be a hit or miss, as with most Chinese restaurant, it is understaffed. Reservations recommended for dinner."}
{"text":"First time given one star to a restaurant because of the services. 1)there's a dish told to be wait for 40mins, we said we don't want it at first, then pops up at the bill and yes the dish took one hour (steam rice) and was given when we ask for the bill. 2)server took away menu without permission 3)ordered 4dishes, first 2 took 20-25mins, other 2 took another 20mins/ total 40-45mins for 4dishes? Only ordered fried dishes... Shouldn't be taken that long. And the restaurant weren't full of people. 4) no napkins given until ask for it 5) sever mixed our dishes without permission again! That was very rude, just because one of the dish were almost finish doesn't mean they can put them together without asking the customer's permission! From all those reasons, I will not recommend anyone to visit this place"}
{"text":"Mmmmm...started our food trip with an early morning discounted dimsum here. That means making you you get a table and order before 11am. We don't fill out a check list to order in NYC. Love the checklist ordering that they have here. It guarantees that you can get what you want as long as it's on the list. No need to rush the carts. From what my Canadian aunt tells me, there is only one dimsum place in the area that does the carts while everyone else does the checklist. Must gets: har gow, and the house special buns. The shrimp were fresh and large. The dumpling was the size of my one years old's fist. We got 4 baskets of them. The buns were loved by the kids. Was sad that I couldn't get shrimp rice rolls until after 11am. But was too stuffed to order it when the time came along. Definitely much different than NYC but they were much tastier! I wish we had more time in Toronto."}
{"text":"Loved the slight changes to traditional dim sum dishes.   I hardly venture out of the Richmond Hill/Markham for dim sum but here I am for a family dim sum brunch.   Did not have any high hopes here, as there wasn't line up out the door and found parking very easily on a Mother's Day Sunday, which is like winning the parking lot lottery! But they actually made me go WOW that's neat!  Char Siu bao (roasted BBQ pork bun) - served on a husk boat, this delicate light bun already made everyone say, this is the char Siu bao?!  The bun is the lightest and fluffiest bun I've seen/had for dim sum not that tradition bread at all, which compares as dry and heavy to this. The meat ratio to sweet sauce is in great portion and makes this bun a must try.  Taro puff was shaped into a bird nest, topped with a peeled boiled quail egg, it had lots of minced pork and mashed taro inside.  Har Gow- a favorite, it was filled with lots of plump shrimp, no fillers here. Rice wrapper was steamed well but had a nice chew to it.  BBQ pork baked pastry was filled with lots of meat in a very flaky pie crust based wrapper, these would be great reheated later unlike most dim sum dishes.   Early bird pricing is before 11am so get your orders in before then!"}
{"text":"my friend took me here because this place os her family's favourite restaurant for dim sum and I can see why. we went early on a weekday for their special: 3.10$ any dish before 11am if paid by cash. 99.9% of the food we ordered were amazing!  My favourite has got to be their own special bbq bun - a perfect balance of sweet and savoury, with a nice buttery ending from the dough.  Custard buns were hot and fresh. Buttery and sweet and the filling had a texture when you bit into it which I enjoyed.  Their fried squid tentacles were not the typical fried ones you normally see - they look like they've been grilled and they were thick ones with 100% deliciousness.  Sui Mai's were juicy and full of shrimps and pork - you can't go wrong here. I also really liked their steam roll with dried shredded pork - the peanut sauce that came with this dish really made it stand out   I didn't like the steamed shrimp rolls because it was not the usualy taste that i expected. Theirs came with vegetables and it was different and tasty in a novelty way but I preferred the old way without vegetables...and that's pretty much the only thing I didn't like about this place"}
{"text":"Last time i come 3 dim sum has metal debris. Today I come and there is a dead mouse beside my chair. This is a horrible restaurant.   I will make complain to food safety canada for sure.  Also people. Don't risk your life over there."}
{"text":"Very good selection of classic Dim sum dishes. They provide a menu where you can select what you want instead of waiting for the carts to come to you. Quality is pretty good compared to other places, but can get pricey depending on the \"size\" of the dish you're getting. If you order before 11am, all dishes are $3 regardless of size. Service is relatively good, but not consistent all the time. Overall I've had a good experience here, would definitely keep coming back"}
{"text":"Crown Jewel Fine Dining is a new Chinese Cantonese restaurant that replaces Sam Woo Seafood Restaurant at Bamburgh Circle.  A much needed renovation resulted in a more open and brighter dining environment.   Price point for dim sum is at the higher side: S ($2.80) M ($3.80) L ($4.80) XL ($6) SP ($8) J ($9.80) but it is a baragin during Early Bird Special: $2.80 S/M/L before 11 am everyday!  We ordered a few items to try, most of them were well made with high quality ingredients and nicely plated.  Har Gar (L) - excellent, jumbo shrimps with excellent bite Sui Mai (L) - excellent, caviar didn't add much taste but looks good for photos San Tau Dumpling (M) - The wrapping is a little doughy  Beef Balls w/veg (S) - I prefer the bigger balls and water chestnut version for more bite Chicken Feet (M) - The sauce is well flavoured and the braised feet is soft and nice Deep Fried Pork Dumpling (M) - Looks pretty but just too doughy with hardly any fillings BBQ Pork Rice Roll (M) - The pork was just too lean/dry and healthy , meh   Sadly, I didn't take advantage of the Early Bird Special and ended up paying full place but still worth it.  Service is attentive and friendly.   I will be back to try out other interesting items on the dim sum menu during Early Bird Special!!"}
{"text":"Came here with the family and family friends on a Sunday morning. It didn't get too busy until we were about to leave (about noon). As some other Yelpers here mentioned, you ought to make a reservation before heading down.  The problem I found with this place, the food was just decent, despite the prices. The taste relative to the price isn't there for me. The service was pretty good though, I'll give em' that. They're often checking up to clear the the tables of empty trays, and they are especially good on filling up your water for tea, which is great!   When it comes to dim sum, one of my biggest head-scratchers is the the incompetence in filling up water and I go thirsty. This place will keep you teased, no joke.  By the way, morning special before 11am with non-special dishes just under $3 a piece. Order before then, you'll be good. Still a little pricier than many other restaurants I've visited, but I suppose it is to be expected coming here."}
{"text":"Goods:  -crown jewel bbq pork bun -lua sa bun -fried dough rice roll -har guow (best I've had in toronto, had fresh shrimp and a chewy casing)  -shu mai  Bads: -hu gok (small and flavourless) -rice rolls (too thick ) -chicken feet (too salty)"}
{"text":"Went here for my kids first birthday party. We ordered a few dishes including the Peking duck.   My updated review for this place has gone down. I would think this place will slowly deteriorate into nothingness and get replaced by something else unless they improve the value of their restaurant food and service.   For one they need to hire more English capable staff. Although they are more patient than other cheaper places it still gets very difficult to communicate with them and you just end up giving up when something sounds.   I tried to order the Peking duck one way in the hopes that at least we'd get more meat on the first course. Unfortunately that experiment didn't pan out. I noticed a large chunk of the duck was being taken away. Rather than waste it I just spent a few dollars more to get the second course even if I am not too fond of the second course.  The duck is still good though.   I ordered the stuffed crab claws. They're pretty pricey at $6 each. It was good the first time I tried it a while back and I was hoping to indulge myself with it. Unfortunately this time around it had significantly less crab meat and more shrimp paste.   We also ordered a seafood soup dish. It was a tad bit too salty for almost everyone on the table though. Barely tasted the seafood because the salt was overpowering it.   Finally we also ordered the Cantonese wedding noodles. Though it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. Something about it was lacklustre. Fortunately there was some left over duck to make it a bit more tolerable.   On its saving grace they gave us some complementary dessert which wasn't too bad. At least it wasn't red bean. Tapioca taro soup, sesame balls with green tea paste and lychee jello with goji berries.   Honesty I am just being nice giving this three stars it's down to 2.5 stars in my opinion. I feel bad that this place is deteriorating. It started off so well.   Even their signs are not fully lighted up."}
