{"text":"Best wings in Pittsburgh!!! This place has a HUGE variety of sauces . Everything taste great and the people that work there are friendly.  The only negative thing about the place is the smell sticks with you as its a small joint."}
{"text":"The food here is very good.  I've had the wings, subs, salads and all have been a 5 rating.  Taste wise, I really like this place.

The problem I had with this place is that they don't have a very accommodating menu and are not very accomodating themselves.  For instance, I like to order wings and would love to have fries with it.  But an order of fries there is for a group of 2 or more and like $4.  I asked them if I could just have a single order of fries and they said no.  Another example is they have a wing day ($.40 wings, eat in only).  I called to order wings because sometimes it can take a while to get your food, expecially if there is a line.  Even though I am a regular there, they wouldn't take my order ahead of time.  Refused. 

So, their food gets a 5, their ownership gets a 1, overall they get a 3."}
{"text":"They was very rude, cooked chicken on top of garbage, they got mad because I asked them to wash their hands, dirty kitchen, cooks and servers was digging in noses, scratching their body without washing hands and dirty clothes."}
{"text":"I knew the chicken parm sandwich was gonna be fried frozen chicken strips with sauce and cheese.  And it came out exactly like I expected but the sauce was just straight tomato puree. It was cooked fine. The tomato paste out of the can taste was just too much to bear though.
 Had plenty of fresh cut fries with it.  Those were better than most fries."}
{"text":"Excellent wings at a reasonable price. Probably the most meaty wings in the burgh. Highly recommend.  Would give perfect 5 stars if the place was bigger an had a bar."}
{"text":"food is yummy, but my favorite part is bringing your own beer from home....i enjoy comming here"}
{"text":"I've ordered from Wiggy's on numerous occasions and they are never a let down.  In my opinion, they have the best wings around.  If you like crispy wings and a large variety of flavors to choose from, this is the place to go!  In addition, their loaded fries are pretty amazing as well.  I would highly recommend Wiggy's if you are in the mood for some good wings!"}
{"text":"Wiggy's is a little slice of Americana. 

My fav wing joint. The most crispy wings in the burgh! Just ask for extra crispy -- which is hard to find around here, I feel. 

These wings are really special. I like to get the garlic parm and then a few extra sides of sauces to dip in. I've been ordering these for 7 years. Ranch is homemade and delicious. I've also tried them with fries and cheese bites. Also good. 

Did I mention they're also BYOB?!"}
{"text":"We recently relocated to the area, from a county over so not too far. And, every area we live in we try find our new favorites for our staple foods, i.e. Wings, Chinese, Pizza. This has become one of our top two wing places, ever. The wings are great size and crispy with any of the sauces or seasonings being well covered! Great pricing for the quality and over food experience. My only suggestion would be to change to a new location or vamp the current one; it'd be nice to feel comfortable staying and eating. The current venue feels too...cafeteria like and leaves a lot to be desired. There's a fine balance between laid back and cool verse cheap; this walks slightly on the cheap side, underselling it's great food!! We've tried various other items, none has disappointed!"}
{"text":"Its a small establishment but a clean one.  Plenty of tables (no booths) and a small/medium size television in the corner.  Its enough to listen or catch an end of a game but nothing to watch a whole game or anything.  The wall to the right is decorated with black and white sports photo memorabilia.  There are plenty of wings to choose from.. \"Asian Ginger\" were outstanding!!!  Buffalo Garlic Parm were pretty good.  I like the unusual flavors such a siracha. The menu offers other items such as potato pancakes etc. If you love fried food - this is the place for you.  There are 37 wing flavors.  

Fresh cut fries.  I like this trend. .more restaurants are getting on board!  Wiggys fries are the best (fresh cut) I have had recently.  The oil wasn't \"old\" and they were fresh. Today (Saturday) was a wing day $.50 cent wings.   Good deal.  If you want a to-go container they are $1.00 and a side of ranch $.75.  wow seriously? You can get decent ranch for a dollar these days.. 

50 Cent Wings on Wednesdays and Saturdays.. Dine in only.  
MASTERCARD/VISA accepted for dine in only
Cash for deliveries (no credit cards accepted)
BYOB if you want to bring your own beer (must have ID) 

***Why only three stars? 
$.75 cents for a side of ranch and $1.00 for a freakin to-go foam container on a
wing day? Also,  questions I asked when ordering.. received irritated response.."}
{"text":"Great wings with a very large sauce selection.  Very reasonable prices and excellent service."}
{"text":"So glad I discovered this awesome wing joint right down the road from my new apartment! I never thought I'd find wings that compare to those from Drover's Inn (Wellsburg, WV), but these are honestly just about as good. Pro tip: you can request \"extra crispy.\" Will keep ordering from this place"}
{"text":"Best Wings in Pittsburgh - Weds and Sats they run specials."}
{"text":"Let me just say that I never would've stumbled upon this slice of heaven if I wasn't driven out of the Hop House and their smoke infested box of a restaurant. Thank goodness I did. While I love a good Mikes Hard with my wings...Wiggy's may not service booze, but their FOOD 
The best wings hands down in all of PittsburgH IMO with an overwhelming amount of wing flavors to choose from!"}
{"text":"Greentree has some great food but this restaurant is perfect. The wings are so good ! They are fresh and the sauces are so good. There are so so so many to pick from and the fries are good too.

Saturday is a great day to go. 50 cent wings with so many sauces! You can not lose with this combo. You do have to eat in i believe , so be prepared to hang out ! You will not be disappointed and you will leave full!"}
{"text":"Their food is ok at best. The thing that creeped me out is that I HAVE NEVER SEEN THEM USE *kevin hart voice* gloves at all

Prices are cheap but I threw this food away... So yeah"}
{"text":"First off, Wiggy's should have a higher rating, there are several reviews here that are praising of them and the food but only give three stars???? 


I have been to Wigg'y on several occasions and have NEVER been disappointed. 
Their wings are arguably the BEST in Pittsburgh, and you can beat the price.  

Large size, lots of meat on the wing, Great seasonings, and Value you get so much food for a great price!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!! We use to order here all the time but today we went to dine in because we were out and about. We had our 4 year old son and 3 month old daughter with us. Our son does not eat many things because he is autistic and has texture problems so we decided to get him Wendy's(which is one of few things he will eat). My wife and I wanted Wiggy's so we went there and brought his Wendy's in with us. We just finished ordering our meals at Wiggy's which was going to be close to $40 worth of food. We then were rudely told by someone behind the counter that we couldnt have our son eat Wendy's in here. I can see nicely telling us this but this guy was a real asshole!! I just don't understand if we are ordering $40 worth of food from Wiggy's, why its such a big deal for my autistic son to eat Wendy's along with us. I'll never give them my business again and will tell everyone I know to never order from such a insensitive and ignorant restaurant."}
{"text":"Two Things you WONT say about WIggys:-

- I wish they had more flavor options
- I wish the wings were bigger

They do a great job on both, its a \"Hole in the Wall\" type place and I have been several times when I have been in the \"Burgh\" on business. The Portions are huge and I am always stuffed. The Prices are very reasonable as well.

BUT - if you are going to take the wings to go, make sure you have somewhere to dispose of everything afterwards, otherwise your place will reek of the smell.

Also they are not too flexible on the menu, I wanted a couple of flavors - and I wasn't ordering a small portion and was told I could only have one flavor, but it is their place, so play by their rules or there is other options.

If you want to support a local family owned business you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The best wings in pittsburgh period also very good salads. My son loves the chicken finger wrap. I always get my food to go and it's always ready by the time I get there"}
{"text":"Lots flavor choices. Good wings. Last time I went the decor wasn't great. Small single TV so not great place for sports."}
{"text":"Best wings in the West End for sure.  Id actually be hard pressed to name a better wing in the entire city.  Their Siracha wings are amazing, along with every other flavor we have tried.  The place itself is pretty plain (though clean) and the person who answers the phone can be a little gruff from time to time.  But none of it really matters as the wings are the star here."}
{"text":"The best wings in Pittsburgh.  I now live in NYC, but every trip back to Pittsburgh I have to stop at Wiggys.

Plus the staff is awesome."}
{"text":"Love their wings and so many options on spice!!!  loaded fries are very good as well...you won't leave this place hungry!!!  delivery and customer service is excellent"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Husband and I are extremely picky when it comes to wings- these are the best in Pittsburgh! Salads are also amazing."}
{"text":"I was actually really surprised that this place had such variety of wings!! They had a lot of flavors to choose from and the prices were pretty reasonable. We got take out for 32 wings in which you were allowed to pick two flavors. We got the Jamaican Jerk and the sweet chili. We also got an order of cajon fries. The wings smelled so delicious that it filled the scent in my car for a week! I really did like both flavors and also the cajun fries which had a generous portion. The Jamaican jerk was a dry rub which I liked and the sweet chili tasted like duck sauce with flakes of chili peppers. The wings are not that big but just a decent size. The fries were really good as they had just made them. The only downside to take out was that the food was so hot that it had burned through the foam container. 

The place itself is clean and there are plenty of sitting area. While waiting, they even had arcade games in which you can play. I would definitely go back for wings! My order actually didn't take too long. We waited for probably 15 minutes or so which wasn't too bad. 

NOTE: $0.50 wings on Wednesday and Saturday for dine in only."}
{"text":"Ive decided to update since I've actually dined in and experience their wings & wing night a few times. 

FYI Wing night is on wednesday til 930pm. The wings are 50cents each. There is no limit on the number of wings or number of sauces you choose (basically you could order one of every flavor if you'd like---- but dont lol) The wings arent jumbo but the number of sauces that they offer and the freedom of choosing your amount makes up for it. Their fries are fresh cut so that is also a plus.

Last night my bf ordered 5 buffalo garlic parm & 5 honey bbq. Since i wasnt sure if id finish them (& you cant take them with you) i only ordered 3 teriaki w/ sesame seeds which was actually the perfect amount.  We ordered a large fry (4 potatoes) and couldnt finish them! The ranch was awesome and they gave you a large amount for 75cents.

Deff worth a wing night experience. The workers are super kind."}
{"text":"Worst wings I've ever had and terrible service how can you be this bad and be this expensive. The sauce is just dumped on these wing and they taste like shit not to mention rockafellers and wingstop have better wings for cheaper. When I got there I couldn't even find a table. This need a remodel for the inside of he building also it's embarrassing. The funny thing about this place is its somehow has gotten worst I came here a few years ago and it was mediocre now it's awful save your money and time with this place please. I was so pissed with the service I made my first review"}
{"text":"I have been hearing about Wiggy's salads for a while at work and I finally decided to try it last night, my first time. I placed my order for a steak salad over the phone with a young man who was very nice. When I picked up my salad, it was around 8:30pm and people were still coming in to pick up their orders. I hadn't eaten all day and I had a long drive ahead of me so I decided to at least eat the french fries on my salad.. who likes cold french fries? I sat down and tasted the fries, which were cut fresh and tasted great. The homemade ranch dressing was very good as well. I noticed that the steak had black ash falling off if it so I tasted a piece and all I could taste was the burn. I was bummed because I didnt want my first experience at Wiggy's to be this bad. I took my salad up to the counter and the young man asked me what was wrong. I told him the steak was burned and he looked extremely annoyed and did not apologize or say anything other than \"Guess I'll make you another one\" then he stomped off. He was so rude that it was off-putting. But, I figured he had a bad day. I took a few dollars out of my purse to tip them for remaking my salad. I got up and threw the cup of ranch dressing away. I ate half of it with my fries and the rest had gotten warm while I was waiting for them to re-make my steak. I sat there another 15 minutes waiting. While I was waiting, I heard one of the other guys who was working there arguing with the rude cook about having to re-make the steak that he burnt to a crisp. He was complaining about it and I think the nice guy who took my order was telling him to suck it up. Anyway, thankfully, the rude cook did not bring out the salad. It was someone else. Unfortunately, all he re-made was the steak. So, I was staring at a steak thrown on top of lettuce without the fries or the cheese. I already threw the dressing out .. at this point, I felt like I was in a Seinfeld episode. I was looking at steak and lettuce, minus everything else. I guess I was expected to eat what was left . It was really bad. If anyone was reviewing this incident, I think they would be horrified. If you burn the steak in a steak salad, you re-make the entire salad for the customer. You would think that's common sense, but apparently not?"}
{"text":"Good taste, good price, lovely staffs! Great for quick lunch, I will go back next time when we visit Pittsburgh in the future!"}
{"text":"The wings are good and there are plenty of sauces to choose from. And they come out crispy! Wednesday is wing day so you'll get a pretty good discount. The food comes out pretty quickly and the prices are reasonable.  The place itself, isn't anything fancy or nice. Just a seat and a table. Don't expect any atmosphere, which is no big deal.

What I don't like about Wiggies is the lack of ventilation. YOU WILL SMELL LIKE WINGS! If that doesn't bother you, you'll be fine. But unfortunately, I only go there if I know I don't have to be anywhere important. I avoid this place for lunch because I simply don't like smelling like a grease pit in my work clothes. I'd rather go after work or on my day off."}
{"text":"Best wings in Pittsburgh, hands down. Pro tip: Ask for your wings to be cooked \"extra crispy\" if you're into that. Recommend calling for pick up. They're super quick despite staying busy."}
{"text":"The wings are really good but the reason for my 5 star review is for the steak hoagie. This may seem like an unlikely place to expect a phenomenal steak hoagie, but it's awesome. The meat is a slab of grilled sirloin! No mystery meat here. It's so good. Probably my favorite steak hoagie in Pittsburgh. It's pretty big and comes with above average fries. The ranch dressing is delicious too. I've always had good interactions with the staff and typically call my orders in for pickup without any issue. Their buffalo chicken wraps are pretty fantastic too. So if you're there and want to try something other than wings, you'll leave with a full belly of deliciousness."}
{"text":"My friend has been raving about this place for awhile and I finally got to stop in while I was in Pittsburgh. 
First let's start off that they have 31 flavors of wings!!
Nothing fancy but a great wing place. Very clean and neat. 
Very busy.... Seems like a lot of take out since they don't serve beer and only have a small TV. 
We tried 5 flavors today. My favorite was the Buffalo Garlic Parm..... Delicious!!!
Also had; Mild & Hot Buffalo, Teriyaki, and Supersonic (my son's favorite. I would also recommend Cajun French Fries..... Good stuff.
Save room for funnel cake French Fries with chocolate dipping sauce..... Amazing!!!
Overall a must stop if you  are in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"I came here because my buddy always said when in Pittsburgh go to wiggy's.  This was my first trip to Pittsburgh for work and my first time to Wiggy's - ahhhmazing!  38 wing sauces was mind explosion - fresh cut fries and everything made to order!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I randomly went to Wiggy's last night while we were out. We had no intentions of going out to eat but we got sort of hungry and it happened to be close by. We've walked by a handful of time while stopping in the wine and spirits next door but never really think to try it.

I'm not a huge wing person so I lucked out when I saw they had boneless wings. They have about 30-40 wing flavors if I had to estimate. All of which sounded delicious. Being that it was our first time we wanted to go somewhat basic just to scope it out. I've had terrible buffalo sauces so believe it or not that alone can give me all the information I need to know about a place. We got one order of buffalo mild and one of the honey bbq. 

Our wings came out covered in sauce which was already a great sign. I hate food that isn't saucy enough. Sauce gives food flavor so let's not be stingy. We absolutely loved the buffalo wings. I will say for a mild buffalo it had some heat so depending on you heat tolerance be mindful of that. The bbq however wasn't my favorite. It was very bland in my opinion and the sauce was thick. Almost \"goopy\" if that's even a word. 

In addition to the wings we got a order of Mac n cheese bites and spicy fried pickles. The Mac n cheese bites were every bit as amazing as I expected. The fried pickles however were not. Far too much breading on them and they weren't spicy at all. All the breading took away from the taste of the pickle.


All in all I would recommend Wiggy's to someone who enjoys wings. The actual wings looked a lot better than the boneless. Even if you aren't a wings person they have plenty of appetizers, salads, and sandwiches as well. We will definitely be back to try some of the other wing flavors!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love!!! Why would be anyone ever go to the winged bison place when an awesome hole in the wall like Wiggy's is available. Wonderful wings, great service."}
{"text":"Hands down best wings in Pittsburgh. I love all of their dry rubs and their garlic Parmesan. They have so many flavors, the wings are the perfect amount of crisp. We go every week. Everyone should have them"}
{"text":"Some of the prices are a little high for certain things, but man the food is high quality (for bar style type) and tastes amazing! I agree with another poster, the wings are the best in town! They are big and crispy!!!!! People there are always very nice. Kind of a dingy old looking place that kind of makes you feel like you are in the 80's with a lot of their old school Pittsburgh photo's but I think that gives it a lot of it's charm. If you are in the Ingram, Crafton, Greentree, and Carnegie area and want a quick bite, this place is a must! GREAT FOOD!"}
{"text":"Simple little family run place with tables and TV with sports on.  Wings are specialty but have wraps, sandwiches and salads.   There must be 9 or 10, maybe more, types of wings with cajun, bbg, honey bbq, Hey Mon jamaican, and more.  Was with a friend who likes the wraps and jamaican wings.  Tried the hot bbq wings...they were good.  Also had some fries, that look to be fresh cut on the premises.   They do delivery to the area."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 2005.  I have tried many wings at many different places, but have not found anything better than Wiggys.  I love their Buffalo Mild and Buffalo Cajun wings, but that doesn't touch the tip of how many choices they have.  Their portions are huge when it comes to fries and salads.  The wings are hot and juicy and have plenty of sauce.  You can ask them to make any flavor you want, but they have most of the bases covered.  They have excellent ranch by the way.  Check out their wing nights on Wednesdays and Saturdays!  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing. Great prices and bettet food I suggest that you get the hot bbq. The best wings in the  city"}
{"text":"The wings are GREAT. That's why you go to Wiggy's. The fry baskets are HUGE.

The angry owner guy, well, he's not very pleasant. It's a shame too, because the place always has local high school kids there.

I still go even though he's THERE. But, really, appreciate the fact that people come to your establishment.  I had given it four stars but had to down grade it to 3.

Yes, I love the wings though."}
{"text":"As a wing aficionado, I have had it all.  I have traveled the country and sampled the best.  Wiggys... is not the best... but if somone asked me to pick one place to eat wings regularly it is wiggys every time.   The price, variety,  and consistency wins me over.  There are better wings... but when it is 2 dollars a wing, you can keep it.  There are wing places that are the same price, but your choices are bbq and mild and thats it.  I could eat here everyday for a month and get a different flavor each time.  This is what they do and they do it well.  If you dont like wings... they have a whole menu to provide you without losing the spacial designation of \"wing place\".  Sweet asian chili wings and buffalo chips... tears of joy."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place.  We ordered take out last night.  I had the lemon pepper chicken wings and the Mr. had mild buffalo then we ordered the ranch and cheese fries and an order of the funnel fries.  The portions are huge!  One side of fries could easily be split four ways. They put way too much seasoning on the fries and my lemon pepper wings. To the point they weren't even edible.  So disappointed!  They also forgot our cheese for the fries.  The mild wings and blue cheese were right on point though!  The funnel fries with Hershey's chocolate for dipping were delicious as well! I will definitely try them out again because I love wings and they deliver!"}
{"text":"Big ass buffalo wangz, right to my suite!"}
