{"text":"Well worth the drive (in traffic) for my birthday dinner!!! So happy to have dined at Elia! The food and atmosphere transported me back to Greece (as much as possible.) The location is unassuming, the space cozy and inviting. Excellent service, lovely waiters! We shared a variety of small plates and several entrees, all cooked to perfection. Highly recommend dining here. I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"After finishing an intense day of mountain biking, we stumbled across Elia on yelp. Our experience was stellar. The octopus, grilled feta, and beet salad were spectacular starters. The medium rare lamb was divine. I can't spell or pronounce the dessert we ordered, but it was extraordinary. I rarely write yelp reviews, but this dining experience inspired me. As a native New Yorker, I was more than pleasantly surprised to find such authentic Greek flavors in vegas. Definitely worth the visit :)."}
{"text":"You must go and have lunch or dinner here.  The place is a little gem that sits around 40 people.    We went on a Sunday for late lunch so it was quiet and more intimate.   Alex, our servicer, was attentive and answered all our questions about the restaurant and the menu.  The food; zucchini appetizer, gyro, and chicken kabobs were fresh and delicious.  We also had a dessert, take out Greek salad and with tip cost us around $88.  Anxious to go back to check out the fresh fish dishes."}
{"text":"Fabulous find. Without a doubt the freshest food in town. Where do they find those tomatoes. We tried many appetizers and one was better than the next. Great beans, octopus, zucchini and Greek salad. New favorite of discerning diners!!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Greek food at it's best.  We made reservations for 4 persons and were greeted at the door with a warm welcome.  We started with the octopus grilled and roasted organic beets that was laying in a mound of dandelion Greens called Horta.  I was transported back to my Greek roots the minute I ate the beets and Horta.   Horta being a staple dish in my house growing up....my mother would go into the fields and pick the most delicious greens for us.  I had the Tspoura (grilled sea bass) that was cooked to perfection and my other half had the Colorado lamb chops that were fabulous.  Our friends had the roasted chicken with potatoes and her husband had a pasta with shrimp dish.  I am so looking forward to returning to this fine restaurant.  The service was perfect as well as the atmosphere.  If I could give it more stars I would.  ps.  don't skip dessert...it is delicious no matter how full you are."}
{"text":"This is the best Greek restaurant in Las Vegas. The food is great, and the service is amazing. I definitely recommend going there."}
{"text":"The best Greek food I've ever eaten! Try the pork gyros and Greek salad. Amazing! Service was great too."}
{"text":"Went for the first time this past Saturday for lunch with 4 others. Great experience!! Every dish we tried was excellent and very authentic. Grilled shrimp, pork souvlakia, grilled tsipoura fish, baklava and even the rare galaktobouriko dessert! And good value in $ too. We'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Best Greek restaurant ever.  This restaurant remind me my beautiful memories with my family.  Best staff and foods.  Thumb up!!"}
{"text":"Just found this new Greek restaurant.  The food is flipping amazing!  Tony and Alex the owners were so personable.  Southeast corner of Flamingo and Durango.  You guys gotta check this out! My favorite was the Greek salads."}
{"text":"Wow, best food I have had since traveling through Europe! We tried many of the apps, and each one was better then the last. Grilled octopus, Greek salad, the meatballs, all spectacular! Everything was so fresh and with recipes prepared by a passionate owner, we have found the best Greek food in town."}
{"text":"This restaurant was rated top 10 new restaurant in 2017 according to weekly magazine so we came today. We ordered spanakopita for appetizer, tsipoura- grilled whole fish and solomos -grilled organic salmon and they were all delicious. The place was so nice and servers were excellent."}
{"text":"This was just AMAZING LUNCH  ! I had Chicken soup, it was  lemony and fresh ! Followed by there Greek salad which has the best tomatoes and cheese with touch of home made dressing and chicken pita sandwich that was to die for accompanied by the fries from heaven!  I would give it a THOUSAND STARS  ! The staff is on point !  I WILL BE BACK FOR LUNCH OR DINNER"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and had a fabulous meal both times. It's small and the staff is very attentive. I look forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"The last Greek restaurant we tried was Zaytinya in Washington D.C. and Elia beats it hands down in terms of authenticity and taste.  The lamb chops was exceptionally prepared to perfection.  For appetizer we tried the octopus and it was the best we had tasted recently, the fried cheese and fish roe spread did not disappoint either.  Service was prompt and friendly.   It is a small place, so go early and go often to keep them around in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"First off all, I'm reviewing this place coming from not only a Greek family first generation... but all Greek food has to compare to my mom's, which coincidently is better than anyone else's moms food and that's just the truth.  That being said, I've been in vegas almost 20 years listening to people recommend Greek places like \"hey try that place behind the gas station\" or \"this one place had great Greek food... the chef is Korean so it has a Korean flair..\"  Anyway after so so so so so many disappointments in this town, my spirits have been lifted finally, and I found honest to goodness Greek food. I'm going by the soup and how the chicken was prepared, the breads tsatsiki tomato coffee and galactobouriko. All were quite good to excellent. My favorite soup the kotosoupa was $6! (You hear that Milos you robbing overpriced bastards charged me $28 for a crappy tomato) and way I digest.  For those that complain about the service sometimes, it wouldn't be a Mediterranean restaurant unless you get a little attitude back for your stupid requests or questions so that's a plus here!  Were they out of a dish tonight on my first visit? Yes. Am I gonna leave a negative review? No! That's also a really good sign. It means they ran out of a dish they prepare by hand or take care to make it perfect for your enjoyment and if they're out that's fine, I'll check back next time.  Things are meant to be, I got stood up on my date and this place was her idea. So I got something good out of tonight, my new favorite Greek place!  Anyhoo, even though I only see Mom my twice a year, this place will do just fine... just fine."}
{"text":"Not too familiar with Greek food but I guess we don't have too many in Las Vegas.. service was exceptional during lunch, not too crowed yet they only been open for 3 months. The food was excellent I order a chicken sandwich giro instead of bread it was delicious. I'll definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"The best Greek food in town and actually one of the best family dinner places in town. If you are looking to not go to the same routine, try this place out! The food is fresh and different. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Three owners and no chef. The octopus was very chewy. The Zucchini was great but not for the price. Just okay. They really need to step it up based on the amount of people that advertise for them. Very disappointed. I have no problem spending money if it is good. The Great Greek in Henderson has amazing Greek food for the value."}
{"text":"Fabulous Greek food served by a very friendly staff!  We've enjoyed dinner here three times and highly recommend it. Portions are generous and prices are reasonable.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So happy this place opened! We get Milo's quality food with reasonable pricing. Cute, small and familiar place with a welcoming staff. The food is absolutely delicious. We love the grilled fish, baked feta, all of the salads and dips and lamb chops"}
{"text":"We are blessed to have so many great Greek dining options in Vegas! Elia is one to pick for a nicer lunch or dinner out. You don't need to dress up, but don't come fresh from the gym either (like I did my first time), there's a more formal feel here from the white table cloths to the demeanor of the servers.   Their standout is the grilled octopus appetizer, which I consider a must-get item despite the high price ($16) because it is so fresh and tender, comparable to Milos on the Strip. Their lunch specials include a pita sandwich (get the pork) for something hearty and several light salads if you're not too hungry. Some items, like their kolokythakia (fried zucchini) are only available on the dinner menu, so multiple visits may be necessary to try all the good stuff."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and even better service!!! If you come to Vegas this is a must!  A bit out of the way but sooo worth it!! Nico provided great wine recommendations and every dish was perfect.  So glad we found this place and we will be back!"}
{"text":"We were meeting friends for dinner and wanted a restaurant with a fairly quiet atmosphere so we could talk, good food, and reasonable prices. Our friends had eaten here many times and thought it would Meet all our criteria. Boy were they right. Immediately on coming in, Alex, our server, we lost with a big smile and showed us. to the our table. The restaurant is very small, but the tables are nicely spaced so you can have a private conversation even if there is someone at the next table. Based on the rave reviews on Yelp, we started with the grilled octopus app. Great choice. We also shared the horiatiki salad. Lots of tomato, cucumbers, feta (really good feta!), and peppers in an oily dressing - delish!!! For my entree, I opted for a dish who's name had 16 letters in it (garidomakaronada). Alex was kind and tried to teach me how to pronounce it without any luck whatsoever. Basically translated to shrimp with pasta and red sauce. Outstanding dish. My wife went with a different dish that also had about 10 letters but translated to a more diverse seafood dish (lots of mussels and clams in addition to shrimp) over pasta with red sauce. Also excellent. Looking for a small, classy Greek restaurant with excellent food, attentive service, and reasonable prices. This is the place"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and the Koto salad was amazing.  I loved the fresh dill and feta.  The dressing was light and very tasty.  The chicken was the best.  I'm not sure if it was organic or what, but it wasn't super thick like some of the GMO chickens other restaurants serve.  The service was excellent too.  I've been craving this salad all day and looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall, which would be ok if the service was pleasant. The owner should not be interacting with the customers as he is obnoxious. For that reason alone we will not go back."}
{"text":"My co-workers told me the best Greek food you can find! Had to try! Grilled octopus was simply amazing! I could have ate the whole thing. Lamb chops with warm bread was great! Was so full we didn't have desert! Next trip! Excellent service!! Defiantly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Our first time here and we left feeling disappointed.  The food was good, not great (especially for the cost), but service is definitely lacking.   While I understand smaller restaurants can't always accommodate seating requests, it's unacceptable to refuse one customer's request, then accommodate the very next customer behind you.   We arrived on time for our reservation (which at first they weren't able to find). They seated us at a small table in front of the kitchen. We asked for another table and they said this was the only one available. But the couple behind us arrived 30 minutes early for their reservation and they were seated at a 4-top in the corner (we were both a party of 2). Huh? I thought there weren't any other tables available??   We sat for almost 10 minutes before a server came to take our order.   To start, we ordered the scallops, octopus and zucchini. The zucchini was my favorite - fried, thinly sliced and served with tzatziki. For our entree, we split the seafood pasta (mussels, shrimp and scallops). Besides the zucchini, everything was good, but not special enough to make me want to come back.  Our experience started off rocky, but if the food blew me away, I'd give them a second chance. This was not the case."}
{"text":"It's actually 4.5 stars.  Why- I had better octopus but theirs is good.  Pasta dish is very good and taste well. I had the fish- great they give you option of whole fish vs debone the fish.  Bread for starter was good.  Love the EVOO.  Service helps you and able answers questions.  Small place but busy.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Excellent local gem!  The owners/servers will certainly make sure that the food and your experience is the best that it can be.  Their ingredients they use are the best.  OMG!, the meatballs!!!!  Finally made the way they should be....to die for!  It was so delicious I could eat this everyday.   A must if you live on the west side of Vegas."}
{"text":"WOW! This place is fantastic!   The moment we walked in, we were greeted by friendly staff, and the ambiance was lovely.   We ordered the calamari, the keftadika, the Greek salad and the tarama for appetizers. Everything was DYNAMITE!   Try the Tsipoura for an entree, it is outstanding. Five stars!  So happy to have come across such a gem of a restaurant so close to home. I will absolutely spread the word and come back regularly!"}
{"text":"I went to this place with my wife and in-laws. We are all Greek and can be extra critical of Greek food. This place knows how to cook authentic Greek food. If you're looking for mall cone gyro, go somewhere else, this place has the real pork gyros that they sell in Greece, not the cone stuff that was invented in the Midwest United States.  We had gyros, horta, souvlaki, octopus, and a horiatiki salad. All were incredible. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Best greek food in Vegas!! Great staff! Prices are reasonable.  No need to go to the strip for Greek food anymore. We highly recommend !!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the most delicious authentic Greek food in town. Run down there ASAP.I've tried everything. My favorites are the Horta, chicken kabobs (souvlaki) They offer 2 whole fresh fish options; which are flawless. Better than Milo's."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic food and it feels authentic. They should definitely expand and I hope they do soon. The service was great and the gentleman waiting on our table was fun and made us laugh a few times as well. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This is the most charming restaurant I think to in years, great shrimp , spanakopita is mouthwatering, the meat platter with homemade pita was sensational ,anything on the menu so great . The tomatoes felt like they were picked outside the back door with creamy feta.  The wine list is great,  Alex will help  you with suggestions if you're not familiar with the wine. The  guys are perfect that owns it , and they know how to treat you right to feel as comfortable as you can."}
{"text":"This small hole in the wall spot blew my mind.There is not really a hostess area as one is not really needed due to the size of the space. My friend enjoys Greek food more than I do. I am Lebanese and eat middle eastern food at home all of the time. I honestly didn't even want to go. What was I thinking!!!?? This place has Authentic/Gourmet written all over it. Talk about mom n pop shop. They have about 15 tables. And the place is clean. They do sell beer and wine. This is not your regular whole in the wall Gyro Spot. This is a place where you can go and enjoy an intimate meal in your local neighborhood. without dealing with the fanciness or dealing with the hustle n bustle of the city.   For appetizer I had to try the Spanakopita!   (spinach feta, fresh onion, dill, served at room temp) Awesome!  We also tried the Roasted Feta. HELLO! Flavor explosion!  This tasted like an authentic pizza without the crust OMG a must try.  For the salad we ordered their version of a Greek Salad . The tomato's were so fresh!  I went out of my comfort zone and actually ordered the Gyro since I normally don't order Gyros and man was it good, The pork was cooked perfectly. (portions are good sized portions FYI) We also ordered the chicken with lemon potatoes Very good ! Big portion too!  I will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"My first ever to try Greek cuisine and I must say I was super satisfied. The seared scallops were perfectly seasoned wish it was a little tender, but good overall.  The jumbo shrimp pasta, seared salmon with beets and sautéed spinach were perfectly cooked and flavors were well incorporated. Chocolate tart was good.  Customer service and presentation I would give 4.5 rating. Opened July 2017, fairly new.  Definitely recommend especially for locals. Ambiance was very intimate, cozy, romantic!"}
{"text":"This is my new go to for Greek. The food was amazing, service was excellent, it's very clean, omg the food!! For a brand new little restaurant, they have it together. They kept the menu simple, the prices are so good and it's very easy to find! I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants outstanding Greek food."}
{"text":"Attentive staff (5 stars)!  Which dish will I be coming back for? The GRILLED OCTOPUS!!! It was so tender, flavorful, and among best! This is a must for grilled octopus lovers! Portion wise, it made it a great value too!  My next favorite was their organic beets on a bed of horta (boiled greens seasoned with evoo and lemon juice) topped with garlic mashed potatoes. It was hearty, nutritious, good for the heart as well as your tummy! Another great value and a must if you like BEETS!  The BF enjoyed his grilled chicken pita sandwich, which came with a side of hand cut fried potatoes. He said the chicken was juicy and he loved the tzatziki sauce! I tried some of the fries and it was delicious. For their sandwiches, it can be served with both the hand cut fried potatoes AND a side of Greek salad for the price of $14 including the sandwich. Again, a great value.  We were super hungry so we ordered the full order of their Greek salad (Horiatiki). It was refreshing and a great finish to our meal.   This is a casual restaurant with an upscale feel because of the white table cloths and cloth napkins vs paper napkins. Good for dates, business lunch or special occasions. They can accommodate large parties if you make reservations in advance. They are on open table and I was able to book a reservation on my mobile app.  To summarize: great service, great value and delicious Greek cuisines!! Needless to say, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GREEK RESTAURANT!   There's plenty of parking in the shopping center."}
{"text":"I have been searching for the perfect baklava in this city for years. It always ends up being too dry, or underbaked. However, the first bite of Elia's baklava sent me plummeting into ecstasy. And their homemade organic egg and lemon chicken soup is absolutely phenomenal. The quality of their food is equally matched by their service. I will certainly be frequenting this restaurant from now on!"}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful.  Great local Summerlin restaurant.  Intimate venue, attentive service, delicious food, and great price point.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately had to give 1 star due to not honoring our reservations!!! Hopefully will get to correct this review after eating the food!  So here is the edition  The food is delicious and made up for the reservation fiasco! Started with the Spanakopita, grilled octopus, tomato and feta salad and Lavraki! Everything was exceptional! Will definitely go back with a proper reservation"}
{"text":"2nd great meal here.  If you are looking for authentic flavors at an incredible price this is the spot. Both times I came here were because Meraki Grill was closed (Monday's) but this place is now a go to spot in my book.  Octopus was tender and tasty Taramasalata was perfect I could have a second order of Meatballs and sauce Both the fried Zucchini and the shrimp dish are clear winners as well. Had all of this and a couple glasses of wine for all under $90"}
{"text":"Came here because the reviews were good and a friend recommended - we were celebrating our anniversary and our son joined us. Staff friendly and attentive but the whole place needs work if it's going to make it in Las Vegas. Environment - does not look or feel Greek except for a few old movie  photos in dark frames on the wall. Window air conditioner is used to cool the very small( 12 tables) eating area . Yellow and green decor looks tired and dated . And to top it all off there is no bathroom on premise - you have to go outside and use the single co-ed stall - with no air conditioner - cooled with a fan - very much like a rural gas station . Menus are brought out on clip boards - which could have been cute if they are nicer but these clipboards looked like they are from the dollar store   Food was not bad but do not bother ordering appetizers - we had the skordalia and I am not joking there was less than a cup on the plate - they also low balled the serving for the salad and calamari which were both priced way too high for the amount .  My son and I had the gyros- and we are Greek - Greeks do not typically use pork in their gyros . My husband had skewered meat- again pork which is not the usual meat for a kabob . Tables also did not have salt and pepper or condiments on them . We would have had dessert but are heading out for some at another place instead as we are so disappointed with the value of our meal and the overall environment .  As people who really love Mediterranean food we were hoping this was going to be our new Greek place but it's won't be . we are sticking with the Greek Bistro in Henderson as our go to place for great Greek food and a much more reasonable  price outstanding service and better serving sizes ."}
{"text":"Greek - the way you'd expect it to be (as though you walked in your grandma's house and she was feeding her own children). The spinach pie and Greek meatballs intended as appetizers were my lunch and quite filling. Linen tablecloths, authentic Greek music playing and friendly service. Good place for a date or office lunch break. Happily plan to return with family and try their grilled octopus."}
{"text":"Went for first time  last week had the sea bass and it was excellent.  My friend had the pasta with shrimp. This a gem of a find in an obscure location. Service very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I went to Elia because I heard they served octopus, something hard to find in Vegas, and they did not disappoint. By far the best octopus I've had in Vegas. Nice, tender, and a good flavor. Unfortunately the octopus is an appetizer, so it wasn't as much as I would have wanted. As for my main course meal, I went with the sea food spaghetti which consists of scallops, clams, and shrimp. Absolutely blew my mind how good the food was. Really high quality and great taste.  The only con is that the food is on the pricey side, so expect to spend a lot because the food is so good you'll want more. The serving sizes aren't the biggest either, but i managed to get full somehow. All that said, this is a really good place to enjoy some high quality Greek food. Great service from the employees, kept our water full and table clean without hovering over our shoulder the whole time. I'd recommend and definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We dined at Elia for the first time this evening, drawn by the favorable reviews.  We were not disappointed.  The food was excellent, another level or two above the normal vin ordinare Greek restaurants in this town.  The Gyros is perfectly cooked pork (on the crispy side), not the smushed meat concoction you get at other Greek restaurants (which isn't really bad).  This is a level above for Gyros, accompanied by bread slices, great tzatzika sauce and seasoned fries.  The grilled octopus was similarly excellent, as was the salmon.  They do serve wine and beer and the Greek Chardonnay we had was very nice.  This is a small but very clean and well-appointed restaurant.  The vibe is quite European and the service was very good-attentive but not smothering.  It is nice to find a hidden jewel occasionally and Elia qualifies, having been open only 3 months.  If you want a first-class dining experience, casual and at less than Strip prices, try Elia."}
{"text":"Romantic and cozy restaurant. They start you off with a warm welcome and deliciously toasted bread and olive oil. We ordered the Horiatiki salad and it was mouth watering. Perfectly seasoned in addition the Greek meatballs literally melted in my mouth!! We also shared a grilled dorade Royal that was deboned for us. Delicious!! And ended with dessert and a greek coffee that was to die for."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this restaurant. The food and atmosphere were great!  The owners did everything they could to make sure we were happy with our meal. I noticed they often greeted their customers with a hug and a smile. The grilled octopus was amazing!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is wow real greek food!! This place has real  Greek food and is truly Greek not some Turkish guy pretending  to be Greek"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!  Bad service, cold food!  Will not ever go back!  Small, uninviting restaurant with bad ambience.  this restaurant was completely dead with no patrons, and yet they asked me if I had a reservation! As if they did not want my business. I had Extremely bad service, rude waiters, and the food was blah."}
{"text":"Probably the best Greek food in Las Vegas. The the pork souvlaki and the tiroaferi is AMAZING!!! Try the grilled octopus it melts in those mouth. I have had everything on this menu and I have loved all of them !!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was so amazing and I'm in awe of everything! My dad isn't a picky eater, he'll eat anything but it's hard to impress him. His exact words were \"I don't remember the last time I ate this well where everything was really good.\" I was shocked. To start we ordered the octopus and calamari. The calamari is very lightly friend and tender-- not chewy at all. Same for the octopus. It came lightly dressed yet somehow was packed with flavor.   For the main course, my dad had the salmon with beats, and I had the Tsipoura with horta. Both were cooked PERFECTLY, and my dish didn't taste \"fishy\" at all. My dad's salmon was medium rare and the perfect size.   It's a little pricy considering we didn't have any alcohol, but you get what you pay for! I'm already dreaming of my next visit."}
{"text":"Best Greek Restraunt ever. The food and everyone that work there are the best. Went with friends two weeks ago and been back 5 times in two weeks. The food is top quality and is just like you are in Greece. Appetizers, wine and the meals are amazing. They serve a great Lunch as well. Great quality food. Thanks to everyone there for a great restraunt in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I went for lunch during the weekday and had a chicken skewer pita sandwich.  First off, the meat was outstanding.  Freshly cooked and thick chunks.  The pita thick and hearty and fresh.  The rest of the pita sandwich was good and filling for the price of $8.  And being a formal Greek, restaurant, we were served some free bread and oil as an appetizer.  Really good bread - toasted and crispy - perfect for dipping.  I was hoping for a lunch special as other Yelpers had spoke about, but a fantastic pita sandwich for under $10 is definitely solid at a nice place like Elia.    During lunch, there was literally no one else in the restaurant but us . The place is tiny already but felt even smaller with us as the only patrons.  Service was fine but he seemed a little annoyed at us ordering lunch food rather than entrees.  Weird part was the outside bathroom - clean, but not in the restaurant proper which is atypical for sure.  In and out in less than 45 minutes.    Being the only higher end Greek in the area, I hope Elia survives.  But offering lunch species or Happy Hours might help out for the less adventurous in the area that aren't willing to drop $25 on authentic Greek food."}
{"text":"One word:  AMAZING!!!!  Run!  Do not walk. Get to this restaurant before everyone learns about how great this place is!  We had 5 appetizers and the whole fish. Everything was prepared and presented to perfection. And the prices are extremely reasonable for a restaurant not on The Strip. Bottom line--you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I would never eat here! I order a plate that I didn't even eat it, the meat was so old and smelly it made me want to throw up so nasty and I over paid for something I didn't even eat. The worst part about it was we waited one hour to get the expired food!!!"}
{"text":"Elia is a hidden gem.  Delicious food and great service.  I've been here a number of times and have never left disappointed!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best homemade Greek restaurant I have ever had. The people working are actually Greek and I'm pretty sure the owners mom and grandma are in the back cooking. Overall the food was delicious fresh and very reasonably priced. Tim and Niko are great with customers. 5/5 must try if you like Greek food."}
{"text":"BEST LAMB SOUVLAKI I'VE EVER HAD. And Greek/Mediterranean food is my favorite, so I've had A LOT of it. This place is hands down the best in the city. Grilled octopus, thin fried zucchini, saganaki, baklava... all mouthgasms."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped I for lunch. We had shrimp in tomato sauce and feta, grilled octopus, gyro plate and souvalaki. Everything was great as well as the service. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow! Fresh made Greek food! Delicious! Everthing is fresh and you can tell. I had the gyro with salad and fresh cut seasoned fries. Best greek food I've had in Vegas. Also the staff is very friendly and the resturant is clean and nice. Perfect for a dinner party! If you love Greek food then you need to check out this place!"}
{"text":"Whoa! This place was a find. Delicious Greek food, welcoming service, and an excellent selection of Greek wines. We used to love Milos on tbe Strip but our recent visit was underwhelming. If we lived here, we'd be here every week! Definitely worth stopping by for a visit. Will be back anytime we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love this nice little Greek restaurant! The food was delicious and the service was amazing. Things I had...  Tzatziki ($6)... tasty and refreshing yogurt with pieces of cucumber sauce. I ordered Tarama but Tzatziki came out. It's all good.  Grilled octopus ($16)... Must order this dish! So tender and not salty like the other Greek joints' grilled octopus. Small portion. Like someone here said, I could eat 10 orders of this dish. It was that good.  Souvlaki ($6 each)... Chicken and pork skewers. They were perfectly cooked. Moist and flavorful. Pork one was a little too fatty for me.   Horiatiki ($16)... Large sharable salad. Simple tomato, cucumber, green pepper and onion salad. Feta cheese was good.   Tsipoura ($29)... Whole grilled Daurade royale. Not many places offer this fish grilled. Tasted very fresh. Simple lemon EVOO and salt pepper seasoning but super rich flavor.   Both waiters were so attentive and friendly. (From Greece) The bathroom is located outside of the restaurant. Was not air conditioned when I went in. It was like 110 degrees inside, lol. Other than that, I LOVED everything and can't want to come back here ;-)"}
{"text":"The Yelp reviews let us down on this one. Based on those we took our oldest and most favorite Chicago friends here for dinner last night. Although the service was good, the food was the worst Greek food, and possibly any restaurant food, I have ever eaten. Burned bits of Gyro meat, inedible Greek potatoes, some kind of white fish being passed off as Sea Bass, all very disturbing, disappointing and embarrassing. Maybe it was an \"off\" night for them. I won't know because we will never come back."}
{"text":"Went to Elia for lunch on a Saturday . Hate feeling like I'm doing the restaurant a favor by showing up but that's how we felt . Ordered terokefteri (sp) which was very creamy and good  But when we asked for pita to go with it the server acted like we were idiots and of course the pita was on the way. We next got the wonderful tomato and feta salad which was great and still \"the pita was on the way \" .  The service came off as rude and put off ish . We understand there's only about 10 tables and the servers may know every person that comes in but us . Also ordered the octopus and it was unavailable for a \"couple hours\" . Maybe we caught them on a bad day . The gigante beans were good . The spanikopita was cold which maybe that's how it's supposed to come out . I usually had it warmed up a little . Overall was really looking forward to this spot and it was a disappointment .  Might go back because wanna try some other dishes and the octopus ."}
{"text":"WOW!!! The octopus, calamari, meatballs and Greek salad are a must. Very attentive and friendly staff.  Our entree was the \"tsipoura\". Honestly I can't wait to come back and try the other appetizers and a different entree. Will be back soon and often!!"}
{"text":"Great food and superb service, everyone's is really attentive to the comfort of the guests, this is the third time there, found the food quality and service consistent as the first time, you can see that the owners has great experience in the restaurant business prior of this, they managed a 5 stars restaurant on a strip restaurant.  We had the Branzino, ribeye steak and meatball. Great food and real fresh.  Richard A"}
{"text":"Great little joint hidden off Durango.  Very good food!  Tomato salad a must!  Meatballs were big hit!  The chicken kabobs were awesome. I had sea bass was very tasty!  My only complaint is my fish had too many bones for being filet already.   Little on pricey side but great food. Service was adequate. Will return sometime"}
{"text":"I have such mixed feelings about this place and was deciding between 3 and 4 stars.... overall, the food is what makes a restaurant going to but service definitely matters. The personality of the owner serving us was so cut and dry that it made out dining experience uncomfortable.   I highly recommend the pita sandwiches and grilled octopus starter. I will say everything we had was heavy on the salt but still very tasty   I'm interested in giving this place another shot"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! If you are looking for authentic Greek, Elia is for you. The service was amazing and the food was out of this world!"}
{"text":"I am so glad to see more and more authentic restaurant in Las Vegas Suburb . If you go to Elia you will have a real Greek experience ,not the one you see in movies, but a real Greek experience. From the Greek waiter to a Greek chef and Greek wine, you feel like your are over there. I am glad to found some appetizers who were Vegan and Vegetarian. My friends hate some octopus and meatballs and they told me, it was of the best they ever had. Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Such a great experience at Elia! The customer service was amazing and most of all the food was delicious. We started with a bottle of Biblia Cora. Very light and sweet. I reccomend this bottle if you are pairing your dinner with any seafood. It is a perfect match. For appetizers, we ordered the grilled octopus which everyone on Yelp reccomended! So good. The texture and flavor was cooked to perfection. Another stand out appetizer was their meatballs. It had so much flavor. I reccomend that too. For our entrees, we ordered the lamb kabobs and the sea bass. Both dishes had so much flavor. I was surprised. Since it was my man's birthday, they surprised him with one of the desserts on the menu. It was called galaktoboureko. Soooo good! You know when you get those free birthday desserts, it is usually alright but man this dessert was pretty memorable haha.  Going to go back and check out their lunch!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty amazing, a friend of mine had told me about it.  We came in for dinner on a Tuesday surprisingly it was pretty busy. We ordered the octopus OMG it's freaking ridiculousness!! I think they add CRACK to it because it's amazingly addicting. We also had the fried zucchini chips witch wore really good, also had the Greek salad I'm really not a fan of tomatoes but wow it was really good. As far as dinner we ordered another order of the crack octopus we had the lamb and the grilled Tispora, the fish came out grilled whole it was just what we wanted so rich buttery flakey nice and lite, the lamb was amazing 3 chops in the order came with fires.. over all this place was a life changing experience, man that octopus I would just go back for that.."}
{"text":"I cannot begin to say enough about having quality, authentic Greek food with superior service!  Everything from the spanakopita, souvlaki, and marouli salad was delicious!  I recently saw a segment about this restaurant on the local morning news and I was not surprised to learn that the recipes are from the owners mothers back in Greece!  Truly authentic!  A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"First, the critical deets: Make a Reservation! They serve Greek beer & wine (YAY)! It's Dee-Lish!!!!!  I am sooooo happy to finally have a great Greek restaurant that offers linen service and doesn't make you eat off plastic plates or out of tin foil circle pans!!!!  Service is familiarly phenomenal.  They treat you like you are a long-time friend of the family.    Responsive to every request (except ketchup for the hubs and I don't blame them for that....i woulda ignored that cray-cray request too!!)  Cannot say enough good things about the food.  Complimentary bread is grilled & crispy in all the right places.   Saganaki...simplistic & yummy!  We had the cabbage salad (could easily serve four) which was exactly as described uand exactly what i expected with a basic vinegar/EVOO \"dressing\".  I love cabbage so was happy, but if you aren't a cabbage lover, stick with the classic greek salad.  I had the grilled octopus appy as my entreé.  The octo was grilled to perfection with some char here & there and amazingly tender. It was a huge portion (especially compared to other restaurants) and shareable....unless you're me.  I shared exactly one tasty kibble and was selfish with the rest!!   Warning tho....if you don't like onions, stay away.   You could probably ask for it without them, but.......        Hubs had the gyros with fries and the pork was tender & moist.   Fries were, well fries and nothing over-the-top.  But hey, I didn't come here for French fries!!!!    We ended up taking home nearly half the gyros and pita so dish could easily be shared.  The perfect end to the evening was the custard (5/5), baklava (4/5) and smooth-as-silk cappuccino  Apologies for the lack of pix....we were so eager to dig it, some were after a bite or two & most were missed completely.    We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was there for dinner. What a great addition to the Las Vegas dining scene! Elia is terrific. It is authentic Greek cuisine, not the dumbed-down Americanized stuff too many \"Greek\" restaurants serve. Three of us shared five appetizers (the gigantes, spanakopita, pantzaria, octopus and kolokythakia) and we enjoyed them immensely. Dinner: the gyros (made with pork - common at numerous Greek establishments all over the world - not the food service beef-lamb combo one sees far too often) - delicious; the salmon (we requested lemon-roasted potatoes as a replacement side, cheerfully accommodated) - both fish and side were terrific; the pork souvlaki - an excellent choice. Can't wait to go back to try the rest of the menu. Elia will be a restaurant we visit often. No question."}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant. Very little to add to previous 5 star reviews- other than that this is not the place for you if you expect a quick bite! But if you enjoy lingering over delicious food and wine and conversation then this little gem will delight you."}
{"text":"I did take out tonight. Tues night and they were full. No empty table. They were so helpful and because the wait was 30 min I got a free taste of some red wine.  Every customer looks so happy kissing each other!  Must be a Greek thing.   The sea bass that passed by me looked so tasty.  I took out the octopus, calamari, meat balls, pork and chicken skewers and gigante beans and a gyro entree. My family loved the food.   We paired it with a super Tuscan at home and was in heaven.  I would rec a reservation since this place is hot."}
{"text":"Loved the place the grilled octopus was amazing they whipped up a special suvlaki w lamb for us."}
{"text":"My friends and I chose this restaurant because of the 2 $$ rating on Yelp. Great location, and that is about all. I posted a review on Facebook about my experience at this eatery with my friends, and instead of saying thank you, is there something we can do better, the owner basically insulted me online. The food is not what you would expect for an average price of $38, it is mediocre. The soup was cold, and tasteless. The fried zucchini was so oily, the bread crumbs slid off as it cooled. The music was so loud it was hard for us to talk, so we sat and ate, and brooded about the ok food. The decor leaves much to be desired. A few pics of \"famous Greeks\" and absolutely no ambiance. Dismal lighting, and very uncomfortable chairs, the dining room is laid out very awkwardly, it would be hard to get around if the place was actually full of customers. I would have given 1 star, but the waiter was very handsome, the only saving grace. I give this place a year before they close up. Gordon Ramsey, here is a project waiting for you!"}
{"text":"Horrible place.  Rude owner. With the attitude we encountered they will fail within a couple of months."}
{"text":"This small, table clothed restaurant was packed on Friday night and we witnessed 2 parties being turned away at the door.  Fortunately, I had secured an OpenTable reservation well in advance so we were escorted to our table by the owner.  Though there was a large family gathering, the service throughout our meal never skipped a beat.  We received a basket of grilled bread along with EVOO.  Next came an order of horta, greens with EVOO, that was quite fresh though I could not tell you what greens were used.  My wife ordered what turned out to be the best farm raised salmon dish she has ever experienced.  My Colorado lamb chops were cooked to medium rare as requested and accompanied by lemon potatoes. The lamb had none of the funky flavor associated with Australian lamb and proved to be tender as could be.  Will we be back?  You can bet your sweet bippy on it."}
{"text":"Elia brings back wonderful memories of the tavernas I visited in Santorini. The food is amazing and we are so fortunate to have a great local spot for elevated Greek cuisine, basically eliminating the need to visit Milos on the strip.  You begin with smoky grilled bread and Greek EVOO that is fantastic by itself or good to utilize with their many small plates.  Tarama ($6): Cured fish roe purée/dip Grilled Octopus ($16) Calamari ($12) Roasted Feta ($10): Baked feta, tomato, serrano peppers Kolokythakia ($12): Pan-fried Zucchini Pork Souvlaki-Entree ($18) Garidomakaronada ($25): Jumbo shrimp, spaghetti, tomato sauce  Seriously, everything is delicious. I'm just trying to make it through their menu! I recommend all the dishes I've had! The pasta was particularly outstanding and of course, the Grilled Mediterranean Octopus is a must. It's dressed with the usual EVOO, fresh red onion, and parsley, however, it's missing the beautiful capers. I'm assuming this is a preference of the chef or owners?  Their Pork Souvlaki is the BEST Pork Souvlaki I've had outside of Greece. The pork is really tender and the flavor is on point. The entree version is accompanied by grilled pita bread, Tzatziki, fresh tomato and red onion, and Greek fried potatoes. Everything is wonderful. The potatoes (Greece's version of fries) are the most true rendition of Greek fried potatoes in Vegas and they're so good!  This is already on my rotation of favorite restaurants! They also offer Lavraki (Mediterranean Seabass) at market price and I look forward to trying it as that was one of my favorite dishes to eat at Milos."}
{"text":"It pains me to give local restaurants fewer than three stars, but after bringing a client here for lunch, I was almost embarrassed to have suggested this restaurant.  Thank goodness my client is also a good friend and she was very understanding.   As soon as we walked in, there really is no reception area.  We waited for a minute or so before a gentleman appeared and begrudgingly seated us.  There was no smiles or any kind of welcoming emotions throughout our time there.    There were about another four tables of twos while we were there and there was only the man serving the entire restaurant.  The food was slow and ordinary and our drinks were empty at times.  But most importantly, we felt like an inconvenience to the server.  The icing on top was that this is not a economical meal. The prices are relatively high for lunch and even dinner with the lackluster customer service.    So I am sorry to say I will not be returning and I hope someone else has a better experience than I did."}
{"text":"We were in town for 3 1/2 days and deliberately chose to eat at this restaurant twice. The food is excellent in every respect! The flavors are truly authentic, and the service was excellent! Greek and Middle Eastern is our favorite type of food and we try it everywhere we go and cook it at home quite often. Everything we had here was clean, fresh, not greasy, extremely flavorful, and delicious. We particularly liked the fact that they had several organic ingredients in many of their dishes. I definitely recommend this place if you are in the mood for authentic Greek food.  we will definitely back next time we are in town. Our waiter Alex, is from Greece and was very attentive and knowledgeable we really loved making his acquaintance."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious authentic Greek food it's not in a popular shopping center... But  It's great for a intimate dinner or a casual lunch they serve wine which is a plus!  Very clean Very friendly and Very fresh"}
{"text":"this place is a diamond in the rough. the chef recently came over from another greek restaurant called Milos, which is at the cosmopolitan. the food is excellent and the staff are so nice. the food is also costs was less than at milos. i always recommend this place to friends and family that come in. definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"Upon first arriving to Elia restaurant,  it looks like a hole in the wall.  The bathrooms are actually located outside of the restaurant.   The seating area is rather small.  However the service and food were excellent.    We went as a party of 5.   Everyone was very satisfied with their food selections.  I personally tried the octopus appetizer.   It tasted fresh, in a light EVOO  marinade.  For an entree I chose the gyro dinner.   It is not your traditional gyro meat; it reminded me more of shawarma as it is prepared fresh.  The meat was very tender not overly spicy.  What it lacks in space, it makes up for with delicious food.   Some may consider it a nice date spot.  While others might think it's not classy enough.  They use fabric tablecloths and put candles on the tables for dinner.   I would say go for the delicious food,  then decide from there.  The prices are a little above average, but for the quality of the food I think it was worth it."}
{"text":"Warm and intimate dining experience. Delicious food and wonderful service. Try the zucchini off of the appetizer menus. Delicious."}
{"text":"Attentive service.  Very fresh and sweet tomatoes in the Greek salad. Perfectly grilled octopus, not over salted.  Zucchini chips appetizer are addicting! I will be back to try more menu choices in the future.  Thank you for a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"Finally! I grew up in a Greek house where the cooking was unbelievably good. Elia is all that and then some. Wait staff is courteous to go along with all the great food. Look out Chicago Greektown. Not wanting to come back for my Greek food fix anymore."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place!  The owners are warm and friendly.  Their whole fish is magnificent!  The bread is delicious.  My fav is the grilled octopus.  The lamb is sensational.  The fam loves the cheese appetizer, the bean appetizer and the very fresh salad.  It's a locals favorite and selfishly, I hope it never gets so busy that we can't get in!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Was down for a week in Vegas on vacation and found Elia! Had to come back a second time before we left to go home. The owner is so sweet, he came from Athens. Their food is so authentic. Very great flavor and the atmosphere is inviting. When we come back to Vegas, we will definitely come back to Elia. Thank you for two great meals!"}
{"text":"It's all Greek to me.  And at Elia, it really is. Everything, from the food and the wines are Greek.  Trusted Vegas Yeeps told me to check this place out.  Defectors of Vegas' most impressive Greek restaurant, Estiatirio Milos brought some of the restaurants great dishes here for all to enjoy.  Lunch features a wide assortment of outstanding starters including the incredible grilled octopus almost identical to that served at Milos for a fraction of the price, and an assortment of pita sandwiches and salads.  Dinner, replaces the sandwiches with a wide array of grilled proteins.  For starters, simple, get the grilled octopus. Extremely tender, a hint of bitterness from grilling, A generous pile along with slivered raw red onions is dressed in a peppery Greek olive oil, splashes of red wine vinegar.  Outstanding. Also, do not pass on the kolokythakia (pan fried zucchini with tzaiziki for smearing).  Another dish, straight from Milos, an ethereal thin, crisp batter surrounds finely sliced zucchini.  Oh so good. Other great starters include a great, tangy, blistered slab of uncrumbled feta over roasted tomatoes and Serano pepper's, and an uber flaky, an ungodly good saganaki (crisp fried molten block of kafalograviera cheese), and spanakopita (spinach and feta pie with cross made of flaky phyllo).  Standouts mains:  lavraki (whole grilled Mediterranean sea bass) and paidakia (grilled lamb chops). Both straightforward, no puff and fluff dishes.  The Seabass, perfectly grilled, aggressively seasoned, a drizzle of Greek olive oil and fresh lemon is all that's needed to round out the dish. The lamb chops, grill to temp, again, simply dressed with peppery olive oil and served with a side of lemon scented roasted potatoes.  Very nice selection of Greek wines.  Reasonable markup.  Service is very friendly, i.e. Greek taverna friendly.  Order a bottle or two of wine, enjoy some lamb, and always have the Windex at the ready!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wow!! It has been a while since I have said \"wow\" with every course from appetizer to dessert at a restaurant, but I certainly did at Elia tonight. I have been a long time lover of Milos on the strip, but only go a couple times a year since we never walk out of there with a bill less than $400 for 2 people. Elia is my perfect solution.. Absolutely amazing food at a perfect price point for the HIGH quality ingredients! I cannot wait to return! This is definitely going to become part of our local restaurant rotation. Everything was absolutely fabulous, but the chicken souvlaki was off the charts! So simple, yet so good, do not miss!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant!  The food is truly outstanding.  We took a group last night and we all had an amazing experience.  (So good that we will be going back again tomorrow night.)  I've tried many dishes and everything is incredible.  From the grilled octopus, gigantes, roasted feta,  fried zucchini and delicious salads, you cannot go wrong, truly.  But the salmon (I know what you are thinking, how could salmon be exciting) is SO good!  The lemon roasted potatoes are irresistible.  The desserts are a perfect ending to a great meal!  Alex, who runs the front of house, does an amazing job.  You never feel rushed or ignored.     The only negatives I have found so far is that the bathroom is outside, which is beyond their control & the space is small so I fear by telling people about this place it will make it tougher and tougher to get a table!    Perfect neighborhood find!"}
{"text":"This place is our new lunch spot! We were a little bummed they were out of both fish entrees but the service and food was so excellent, we will be back to try them next time! Best Greek food in the neighborhood. Authentic, not too much garlic, all fresh ingredients. The octopus is the best we've had in Vegas & was just as great as when we had it in Santorini (minus the view of course). The baked feta had just enough spice, the salads were easily  shareable, & the zucchini chips were also a hit. Everything was so well executed and flavorful. My only regret is that we waited a year to try this place!! Well done Elia, well done."}
{"text":"Greek done GREAT!!  From start to finish, this little local joint was an absolute delight offering a step up from the gyro/fries segment making for a delicious, slightly more than casual evening.    The \"Grilled Octopus\" was my primary reason for coming and it totally delivered!  The super tender, tentacles with the addition of EVOO, red onion and red wine vinegar was superb.  I made an oath around the 3rd bite to order it every single time I go here.      \"Roasted Feta\" featuring a block of oven baked cheese over tomato and hot serrano peppers arrived sizzling on a skillet and was a total cheesegasm.  I had no idea feta could be prepared like this as it was kind of like a tender, more robust paneer.  The pan fried zucchini known as \"Kolokythakia\" lived up to the Yelp hype; luxurious veggie chips with a cool, thick tzatziki yogurt dip were addictive as hell and all magically disappeared.    There were many other starters we considered including the saganaki (fried cheese), calamari, and the mussels.  We almost opted for a six starter, no entrée meal, but so glad we didn't!  That's because missing out on sharing the whole grilled seabass would have been a goddamn shame.  Wonderfully grilled, simply seasoned and then drizzled with olive oil and lemon juice let that beautiful fishy flesh shine; fantastic for $30!  Yet another solid spot in SW Vegas!!!!!  4.58888888 stars"}
{"text":"Great place with real pros running it. Food is amazing and service is great. We had the Greek salad, meat balls and the octopus for the appetizers. The salad is to die for. The meat balls have mint leaves and really flavorful. The octopus was really tender  and flavorful. For the entree we had a steamed fish. It was great too."}
{"text":"Favorite Greek restaurant at all time! Grilled octopus and fish entree are must! All the ingredients are fresh. From decor to service, it definitely reminds me the NYC dining experience :) owners are so passionate and knowledgeable about the greek cuisine and culture and they are all from Greece! can't rave enough about this cute little place!"}
{"text":"Awesome Greek food!! I love this place. Very authentic and great Greek wine. Strongly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here for 2 times. First visit was on weekdays lunch. Second time was weekend. Their food was good, their atmosphere is okay.   One of popular menu Grill octopus taste was amazing at the first time, but the second time was salty and taste was not same as first time.  On my first time, I FOUND A HAIR ON MY DISH. I don't remember exactly food name, it was kind of wrap sandwiches. I wore the cap that time and I found it on my last bite. I told our server, Of course they can't charge me this kind of shitty food but I can understand sometimes they can do a mistake. So I just want to let them know about some hair was on my food and said generously. However the server didn't apologized to us and just said their cooker doesn't have any hair. I felt so uncomfortable to call other server, and he tried to give that food for free. i rejected their offer and they gave us 2 deserts on the house. But it was not tasty and I left more tips for the deserts cost.  On my second time was on weekend late afternoon. The last time wasn't good experiences but I want their octopus. Weekend food menu was over price, and waiting time after we order was so long. Even our table seat first but we got an appetizer after later table. Also we got the main at the same time with appetizer and the sever told us this food supposed to be go other table(later one after we seat) Until this it was okay, the octopus was salty and not taste same as last time. My gyros plates was served with small amount yogurt sauce and I asked them is it possible to get more this sauce when I left 1/3 amount of food. They gave us some big portion of sauce(almost 4 times amount as on my dish) and they CHARGED ME $7. If they want to serve the exactly same portion that on the menu, they should let customer know about there's an extra charge!  Overall my experience  Their try to run a homemade greek food, taste was okay but over price over all. Around 10-12 small pieces octopus legs, onions and olive oil is $16. Their wine is $12 per glass, it was not that differences with other wines that you can get $7 wine per glass on other restaurant. Their attitude was not bad but they need to learn more how to care the customer. I WON'T COMEBACK HERE, AND I'D RECOMMEND YOU FIND ANOTHER GREEK RESTAURANT!"}
{"text":"My lunch (shrimp salad) was nice, with large, fresh-tasting shrimp cooked well, against the greens with a little block of cheese added in. Though I must say, I do think they work better as a dinner place, where the dishes seem to be a bit more creative and where the general ambiance would be great for a romantic dinner. The service was attentive and professional."}
{"text":"Elia is a gift from the Greek gods. The service is outstanding each time we come. Our regular plates are calamari (light, flaky, and tender), grilled octopus (you'll taste the time and effort placed into this plate), zucchini chips (THE most light and crispy = a winner), and chicken souvlaki.  Keep going with spanakopita and saganaki. We can attest to the jumbo shrimp, pasta, plentiful lamb chops, sea bass and grilled chicken. My only regret about Elia is my lack of photos."}
{"text":"This is a nice, small restaurant. My friend and I were the only ones there when we arrived at 6:30 but it got busier as it got a little later. The wait staff was great, attentive but not overbearing. We shared the baked feta, which was super tasty! It's a bit spicy too. I had the 6oz filet which was cooked perfectly. I didn't think the lemon roasted potatoes were anything impressive but they were still good. My friend had the regular French fries with her entree and said they were on point. Would definitely go back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh! Note that the seafood is market price. This place is a Strip quality restaurant without the hassle. The interior is extremely small and you have to go next door to use the restroom because it cannot be accessed from the dinning area. The Greek tzatziki was absolutely delicious and smooth. I had the chicken breast which was pretty cooked and seasoned perfectly. The potatoes were very lemony but tasty. Excellent menu but pricey. Great place for a fancy date night. They also take reservations.  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I've noticed a little inconsistency, but on a good day it's the best Greek in the city, and even when it's a little off it's still pretty damn great.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Eatery done right! I have no cons with this delightful restaurant. This is a hidden gem. Foodies go eat and be merry. We arrived on 6/30/18 for a late lunch early dinner.  Starting with the ambiance it couldn't have been better. The colors, tables, music playing and wall decor of wine bottles made the place simple and elegant . We were promptly seated. We had the place to ourselves. I'm sure any later it would be packed. Lucky us.  You won't find salt and pepper shakers here. Which I love. To me that screams confidence! No need to worry because your meal is coming out perfect. That it did.  PLEASE don't hesitate on getting the grilled octopus. It was perfect! This restaurant captures simplicity at it's best. High quality ingredients using very simple flavors. You can't go wrong. For my entree I had the Lavraki (Whole Mediterranean Sea Bass) with a side of asparagus and fresh cut French fries. Troy ordered the Paidakia  (Grilled Colorado Lamb Chops) which I also tasted. YUMMY! 5 Stars can't wait to return.."}
{"text":"If I was a nitpicky person, I could say a few things they can improve overall but they cannot improve the food. It's perfect. Simple dishes made perfectly. A lot of care was put into it - lightly oiled, lightly fried, not too over seasoned, perfect portion sizes. The food does all the talking at this restaurant - which is good because out waiter certainly didn't have a lot to say but in his defense, I think there was a language barrier.  The batter on the calamari was textbook and the feta taste homemade. All the ingredients taste fresh and looking around, there was a lot of clean plates. It wasn't cheap but I'd rather go here than the strip any day!   It's a very small place, maybe 10 tables and no room for a hostess stand but I could see it being romantic at night when they turn the lights down. The bathroom is outside and it's done very beautiful and modern but unfortunately when I made a visit, it wasn't the cleanest. And it's pretty hot in there so make your trip quick. At the moment, they only serve wine and beer but it's a nice selection and it pairs great with the food. For a family night out or a romantic dinner, this place is worth a visit!"}
