{"text":"im shock to give a chain a perfect score, but here's why.

food
-ordered the fajita platter for two containing ribs, shrimp, steak and chicken
-unlimited flour shells
-unlimited condiments (cheese, lettuce, salsa etc.)
-portions were more than generous and worth the money
-flavors were there!
-plus free chips and salsa why u wait for your food

service
-above average, its as expected 

overall i'd come back for the fajitas, i saw they have weekday specials and tuesdays is cheap!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Took forever for us to get our food and the waitress's don't seem to know what they are doing. Get frazzled very easily. Food is good but service not so much"}
{"text":"Just your average Canadian food restaurant.. all the staff were sooooo lovely, gave recommendations, were so helpful which I appreciated cause there was little vegetarian options.. went there for Canada 150, so marked the occasion with a glass of wine! Overall lovely experience"}
{"text":"I hate to give such a high star rating to a chain restaurant, but 3 things to consider:

-I'm rating this with typical chain restaurants in mind
-I had a great experience here
-I'm a little ticked at the crappy rating the other review has, and the whack reasons behind it. New customers had to wait 45 minutes when the barely-open-a-month restaurant was too full to seat them? The nerve! Unprofessional! Surely additional tables could be set up in the Men's room. Chop chop!

Anyway, because I've noticed the massive lines since the place opened, I decided to wait a while until it died down to give it a shot. I'm glad I did.

The hostess was very nice, greeting me with an enthusiastic \"Howdy!\" and was sweet enough to ask if I was a new customer, and filled me in on what she likes from the menu.

Being new, the restaurant is obviously clean. Like, really clean. Eat off the floor clean. While I opted for a booth, it was refreshing to know that I had the floor as an option, in case the evil restaurant decided to something mind-bogglingly inconceivable, like have me wait for a table.
The style is VERY Texan: Country music playing, many references to steer, hardwood floors, even the uniforms. I especially loved the faux-candle-lit chandeliers. I just wanted to grab one and swing across the room. Then I realized I wasn't 12 or Zorro, so I left it alone.

To my surprise, a complimentary basket of tortillas and salsa was brought to the table. While the salsa seemed a little watered down, you can't argue with free.

My attractive waitress (affectionately named after a tasty beverage) was very sweet, gave her own opinions of the menu, and was very prompt with everything. The prices on the menu were also fairly reasonable. Certain items do appear to be pricey.

Those familiar with my Toronto adventures as of late know that I'm on the quest to achieve maximum burgasm, by locating and consuming the GTA's tastiest burgers. So, with that in mind, I decided to forego my desire to check out Lone Star's apparently famous fajitas, and opted for a bacon burger instead.

While waiting for my food, I also had another server pass by, said hi, asked what I'd ordered, and responded very positively to my choice. Very soon after, I had a different server from another section look over with goofy hand-gestures and a big smile. This level of friendly interaction is something I've never experienced in a restaurant. Ever. It especially blows me away that some of it is coming from servers having nothing to do with my table, so it can't be argued that they're looking for a big tip.

And as for the food, the side of chili I got was very tasty, not a single complaint with it. As for the burger...what can I say?
BURGASM ACHIEVED! We have a new front-runner! That's right, tastier, fresher, melter-in-your-mouther than everywhere else I've reviewed thus far. The buns were also by far, the freshest I've had. Who knew I would have found such an amazing burger in Brampton? I mean, Sonny's is great and all, but holy dead cow delight!

If you think this ends with me walking off into the sunset, spurs-a-jinglin', satisfied with my burgasm, you'd be hideously incorrect! While we have a new champion, my search isn't over. There very well could be a darkhorse burger-peddler just waiting to make me O.D. on burgasm-fix, we'll just have to wait and see. In the meantime, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"It's a Lonestar, the food is ok, and the service is ok. The waiter was a little obnoxious, it was almost like the obnoxious waiter from \"Office Space\". I can't say this place is bad, but I wouldn't call it great either."}
{"text":"After havving a bad experience two years ago at the Airport location (poor Service) I decided to give this location a try, considering it was down the street from my house, its was new(thing the service would be better) and I crave fajitas. But unfortunately it was the same deal, long wait to get in, inexperienced server (young girl) and average food. We went in waited 20 minutes for a table, we observed the greeters 4 of them kept turning people away saying it would be 45-1 hour wait, not good business for a new business. Overstaffed and undertrained, turning away business is a no,no, wonder what the owner would think????Anyways finally got seated the server was nice but not all there and you can tell she wasnt on the ball, the bill was 80$ overpriced for a small steak my wife had and some fajitas..might try again in two more years or NEVER AGAIN......Hire the right staff and organize it properly thats the best advice I could give the management....."}
{"text":"To be honest, I expected to hate this place, but I loved the food, and the server was a delight. It is standard burgers, steak, ribs, etc., but for a middle class family joint, it is just fine! Check it out."}
{"text":"Like others, I am surprised to give this place a five star review but it also deserved it. The service was great and friendly, I arrived late for a friends dinner party (ten minutes late to be exact) and was surprised when I got there and the whole party was already seated with drinks. It was a Saturday night and I expected much slower service but what a pleasant surprise. 
I ordered the \"pink cadillac\" as a drink and it was huge, frothy and delicious. I am unsure exactly what it was but it seemed to fall somewhere between margarita and daiquiri. We had two bowls of corn chips and salsa for everyone that is complimentary, lovely setting. 
My boyfriend and I split the calamari and it was delicious, it wasn't too breaded and the breading had a sort of savory and pepper flavor to it which was really yummy. For dinner I got the fish tacos and was a little disappointed because the fish was battered and nowhere on the menu does it say that the fish would be battered, I was expecting flaky fresh fish tacos and this saddened me. However, I did not take a star away from my review because 1. it's a Texas-style restaurant I should have known battered and deep fried would be a must.  2. The service and fun that we had in the restaurant was so great I forgot about my battered woes. 
Since it was my friends birthday we did the birthday singing with the giant cowboy hat and birthday shot for her. She is a shy person but really enjoyed this part of the night. So I guess the reason I gave this a five star was because the establishment made my friend's birthday a great time for her and our group. I would go back another time without a doubt."}
{"text":"This is this first time I have been to this location, but I was pleased to see how clean it was.  The wait staff was friendly and the food was enjoyable.  Speed of service was a plus, as was the attentiveness to our beverages."}
{"text":"Great place very friendly staff. I eat here a lot and the servers go out of there way to make you feel like a some body. I all ways leave with a smile. I'll be seeing you again girls. Keep smiling because you do a great job of it. P.S. I miss the cowgirl hats. :-(  plus the steaks are very well priced and tasty. The ribs are huge and so good. If you have not tried the Deep Fried Ice Cream you must it's out of this world. See you soon Liberty"}
{"text":"Six of us came for my birthday dinner.  We all ordered something different. But all of our meals tasted exactly the same.  Like bbq sauce.  We were all really disappointed"}
