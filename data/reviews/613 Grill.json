{"text":"Absolutely love the lamb burger!  The owners are super friendly and the service is pretty quick."}
{"text":"My meal here consisted of the 16-oz steak with sides of beans and Israeli salad. The steak was wonderfully flavorful, while the sides were only passably good.  The downsides to this restaurant outweigh the good aspects. The restaurant's d√©cor is cheap as can be, but the prices are anything but cheap (my meal was over $30). The service is horrible; we had to wait and wait to get the check. What's worse, they charge customers extra for using debit or credit cards. The final straw was when the waitress began cleaning off our table while we were still sitting at it! She told us that the couple behind us wanted our table. RUDE."}
{"text":"Food was overpriced & service was slow and unhelpful at explaining menu options. I won't go back."}
{"text":"This place recently opened find God in the try them it was okay but when I have my shawarma I do like the Arabic wrap up bread not a pita and some pea soup to go with it their house sauce for the sandwich is odd Sriracha still better the service is little slow considering I was only myself and another table in there but I'll probably give him another chance try something else"}
{"text":"We've been there twice now... Food is REALLY good!  Schnitzel is my favorite (so far).  They have the most amazing pita bread that they import from Israel.  The pita pockets don't fall apart.  Firecracker Chicken was also REALLY good!  My wife loved her falafels too!  Owner/Cook was very nice and he mentioned that the burgers were AMAZING (will have to try next time... they looked great...as one passed by)!  The food is Kosher and very fresh!  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'm going to this place every day. They have the best Israeli food I ever ate. Great service and a nice authentic feelings. I would highly recommend it to anyone who looking for a nice kosher Middle Eastern restaurant."}
{"text":"Best burger joint in Arizona! My friends got Pastrami  burgers and I got a Lamberger. Try the poppers."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food was delicious! I especially liked the ambiance of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food here is consistently good. We really like the burgers and baby chicken in pita. Staff is friendly and always happy to help."}
{"text":"So the biggest problem with my visit was the temperature. At night the place was 94 degrees according to their thermostat. There is no excuse to not air condition a business in the summer.   The Burger and fries were good.  The egg for the sabich was a bit funky looking and we skipped eat it.  The falfel is very dense similar to a mix from a box.  The Israeli salad lacked color, the tomatoes were a pale pink not nice ripe red."}
{"text":"The 613 Grill is a very small kosher restaurant that serves a limited menu of Mediterranean Food and Hamburgers. 613 is very significant in Judaism because it stands for excellence and the 613 commandments listed in the torah. With a name like 613 Grill this little restaurant has some big shoes to fill.  I noticed that on the menu there are some items I never tried before like the Moroccan Cigars and the Fire Poppers so I came just to try those items.  They were out of Moroccan Cigars. (seasoned beef filled pastry that looks like a cigar)  I tried the fire poppers. They were white meat chicken that seemed fried and was covered in a very sweet sauce served with an herbed mayonnaise kind of sauce on the side. The chicken was a little chewy but not bad. They could have used a little heat since they are called Fire Poppers.   The best of what we shared were the Falafels and Pita Bread. The Falafels were the soft meatball texture kind and weren't the most herby but were full of good traditional flavors. The fresh hot pita bread was VERY GOOD.  The Pastrami Burger was highly recommended so we shared it. I did like the beef taste of the burger. They made the pastrami crisp. The kosher beef does have a better beef taste but technically there is room for improvement. The texture of the patties was dense and packed too tight like a meatloaf and the soft white roll fell apart. They gave us a large portion of skinny fries that are similar to Burger King Fries.  The man that served us was very pleasant and kind. The dining room seemed clean and appealing.    They are new so maybe they are still working things out."}
{"text":"I've been there twice. First time was ok. Second time was a disaster.  The food was over salted , they totally forgot one of the dishes we ordered. The french fries, which came with the hamburger reminded me of McDonald's,  from long ago before i kept kosher. Lots  of grease, no potato flavor. Our waitress seemed to disappear midway through and we wondered if she had gone home. We waited and waited for our bill. I asked another waitress to find our bill, twice . Everyone from my party left, we had children who were tired of  sitting. Finally our non waitress came over with a piece of paper with a number on it. She said the machine wasn't working. The number seemed high so I got up and got a menu to add it up myself. My number was a lot lower and all of a sudden the girl showed up with a complete bill. I did not have the patience to see if it was correct--the tip was added in by them because we had 7 people and perhaps they tipped on the food and tax, which is wrong, I don't know. But I do not trust them. They also charge a surcharge if you use a credit card and this was Not listed in the menu. I will not go there again. I CANNOT recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend it the best place located in central Phoenix ,Glatt Kosher, cute & cozy"}
{"text":"Whether you love your meat dishes or are a vegetarian, 613 Grill can accommodate you with many options. From fresh and delicious Israeli salad and hummus to shawarma and kebabs, you get plenty of food for your money. Authentic spices and precision seasoning for every dish prove this place is the real deal. Pleasant staff, fast delivery  and a home made shawarma alone make the trip there worth it. The place is on the small side and fills up fast around lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"This is a terrible, horrifying restaurant--don't be fooled. I have personally seen things happen here that could very well cause illness, the spread of disease, along with poor treatment of staff and customers, and general uncleanliness. I was tempted to call the food inspectors but haven't yet. I saw the \"cook\" drop a plate of falafels and ordered a server to place them back on the plate, before the server proceeded to bring the plate to the customer's table. The kitchen is dirty, all the equipment and tools are caked with old food. The poor staff are treated terribly for poor pay, and the place is understaffed. Please be careful."}
{"text":"As a Jewish and Israeli, this place feels like home for me. I love the Schnitzel and the Shawarma they serve. Great Kosher food but just a little bit pricey... the location is about 35 minutes away from where I live and you can still find me eating there at least once a week. The place is always cooled and clean, as you expect from a highly rated restaurant. I will definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a good tasting Kosher food."}
{"text":"I can't believe the average rating for this place is only 2-1/2 stars! We ate here for the first time this week, and the food was very good. We asked for a sauce to go with the Schnitzel (tender but a bit dry), and were brought a lemony pesto and eggplant sauces. Both were full of great flavor and the best things we tasted! (So happy to take home some of the pesto that was left over.) One thing you should know is that the \"cubed\" chicken entrees are served as Shish Kabobs, although that is not stated on the menu, even though they do show beef \"Shish Kabobs\"... The Basmati rice was cooked perfectly, however, the side salad of chopped tomato and cucumber had no flavor [needed at least S&P], but we added some of the pesto and made it yummy. We chatted a bit with Chef Sefi about the food, and he and our server were very friendly. The prices are higher than most comparable Middle Eastern restaurants, but the food is all Kosher, so worth it if that is important to you. Two negatives are: they are closed on Saturdays in the summer due to Shabbat (I'm sure lots of those who are not Jewish would eat there, being a weekend night). And they were out of Schwarma! We were told that it is always gone by dinner time. Makes me wonder why don't you make more Schwarma if that is your biggest seller? :-) We will be back!"}
{"text":"Kosher restaurants are generally a niche market, and we were mostly pleased with the food and service of the restaurant.  My wife ordered beef kabobs medium well, and they were  very good. I ordered a medium well done steak which was pretty well done (not a tinge of pink anywhere). The chef came out and said that there should be no pink at all when it's medium well.  That's not my experience.  Yet he was kind enough to offer to put up another steak which he did which was VERY good, albeit somewhat fattier than I would have liked.  The chips and Israeli salad (cucumber and tomato) were just fine. The decor was cute and the restaurant was well lit which l liked and the wait staff was quite friendly. Unfortunately, when we asked for the bill we learned that the prices were \"cash only\" prices, and that there was a surcharge for credit cards.  I believe that this is unfortunate and very off-putting.  We had enough cash, but I think that taking credit cards is a necessity for restaurants and that they should absorb the costs associated with taking them  - and pricing the food accordingly. We want to support Kosher restaurants, so we'll probably be back. And we let the server know that we were disappointed about the additional credit card fee. They said that they're working on getting rid of it. Overall, three stars... I would have given it another star had they taken credit cards like most others.  I was very pleased that the chef put up another steak for me.  Food was very good, but not great."}
{"text":"Great little place. I am not Jewish or Kosher but my good friend from New York is. He was in town found this place so we went to eat. Like a moron I still tried to order cheese on my burger but quickly remembered that was not allowed. The owner was great and understanding, still apologized not wanting to be disrespectful to anyones beliefs and traditions! I ordered a burger and fries, my friend ordered on of the k-bobs which to me was just like meat loaf but tastes so much better!   In the end, this was the best burger I have ever eaten. Fresh, cooked perfect, and was just awesome. I would go back here in a heart beat, great food, and friendly people."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Try the burger, especially the 613! I ordered a schwarma plate with high expectations, but I guess I was expecting more (i.e. pita, hummus, tahini, etc.).  Was just a plate with meat and potatoes. Also note, they charge you for using a credit card."}
{"text":"Very satisfied with my shawarma pita! Was STUFFED with meat (chicken/lamb), had great flavor, and was reasonably priced, particularly for kosher - $12.  Atmosphere was nice enough and the service was quick and friendly.  Would definitely go back to get my shawarma fix!"}
