{"text":"Im always looking for a good spot for a family dinner that has great food at a reasonable price.  This fits the bill.  I have been here twice with my wife and my 2 year old.  Both times the food was excellent.  I hold back the fifth star because the service could be better.  There is only two waitresses working on a friday night and they are responsible for seating guests, taking drink orders, clearing tables and delivering the food.  A hostess and a bus boy would really improve this restaurant experince.  
The roasted vegetables are amazing as well as the greens and beans.  Ive also been impressed with the chicken milanese.  I really enjoyed it and the pasta that came with it.
I will definitely be back to this restaurant in the future.  The portions are huge.  Ive taken food home both visits."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant twice in one week and each time the food was served lukewarm at best and during our second visit 3 of 4 main courses had to be sent back.  They then came back no warmer than when first served.

During our first visit, there were 10 of us and the place was not crowded at all, but it took at least 5 - 7 minutes from the first main course to be served to the last main course being served.  
During our second visit, the appetizers, soup, salads and main courses, served lukewarm, were served within a total of 10 minutes.
There appears to be no coordination between the service staff and the kitchen staff.

The food looks great, but for some reason they cannot get it to the table while it is hot."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. It was a recommendation from friends that they liked it. But they gave us a warning that service was slow.

So we arrived with our wine in tow. And a little extra protection if you know what I mean. Now it's not the best part of town. So leave the Range Rover at home and take the older car if you have one. 

We arrived and sat down with the rest of our party. At 7 pm the place was packed and loud. There was no sign on any servers.... made me start wondering what was going on. 

After 20 mins we still had no waters and no one had come over to us yet. Oh boy was this the start of a bad time. 

I had to go to my car just to get a water because my wife was dying of thirst. 

When it came to the wine there was no cork fee. T that's because they gave us a corkscrew and said have at it. I ghee the server doesn't open the wine for you. 

At this point there were two servers for the entire place. Was this a joke! It was the worst service I have ever had in my life.

We started to read the menu and it actually looked pretty good. Lots of good Italian options. 

We order a few apps which took about and hour at this point. Greens and beans was good. Stuffed peppers were good but very hot. And the veggies were just mush but we were so hungry at this point I would have eaten anything. 

When it can to order the waitress made her rounds. I noticed the menu said freshly made pasta. So I asked and she said no it was not fresh. Immediately I started questioning the authenticity of this restaurant.

I opted for the standard fettuccine Bolognese. Thinking that with such a simple order and they can't mess up such a simple dish. Oh but what I was wrong. When I got my meal there were about three noodles on it and about a pound and a half of giant chunks of meat. Normally I like my Bolognese to have a nice meat sauce that is finally chopped up with lots of noodles. It's unfortunate because I left all of the meat on the plate and the waitress didn't even notice anything. I would expect in a restaurant for the waitress to at least mention or ask what was wrong with my meal. But this certainly didn't happen at this place.

Overall the rest of our guests enjoyed their food. It wasn't anything to rave about but when you're making standard chicken Parm or veal Parmesan or breading anything for that matter it's not that hard to make. But with the service being so terrible I would never come back to this place again."}
{"text":"I have been hearing good things about 1905 Eatery so I met a friend there for lunch today.   
We ordered the appetizer \"fried provolone\".  I am a huge fan of the fried provolone  and often order this appetizer when I go out to eat so I expected the typical wheel or stick shape... but folks what I didn't realize is that I was about the eat the best fried provolone in town!! I am so glad I ordered it.  It was bursting with flavor ...it was like real homemade fried provolone.  Accompanied with a side of their sauce .. our taste buds were singing! 

We both ordered a house salad with our meals and had the homemade dressing (oil and vinegar or Italian not sure) but it was good. The ingredients in the salad were fresh. 
 
My friend ordered the cap egg and cheese sandwich and told me that it became more delicious with each bite. The sandwich was oozing with fresh ingredients and had a nice aroma.   
 
I had the lasagna and it was good.  Plenty of flavor and it wasn't all cheese.   

The service is a little on the slow side since there is only one waitress working. I wouldn't  expect to be in and out.  BYOB- fun to bring your own bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is known for great Italian food, 1905 proves that to be true. Excellent sauce, menu selection and fantastic desserts. Seek out this neighborhood treasure, you'll be glad you did. Byob adds to the fun of great food, friendly service and fair pricing for the quality and quantity of food received."}
{"text":"Two things you need to know about this place, the food is great and MAKE A RESERVATION! 

Located on the corner the dining room is small and tables are at a minimum. Servers are very nice. Some menu items are not always available, which I don't take as a sign of a bad restaurant but that the food being prepared is so fresh that they make their dishes from scratch and once they run out of something they simply take it off the menu till next delivery.

We started with fried provolone and cups of wedding soup, both very good. My wife had Penne and Sausage and I had Penne with Chicken Marsala. The sausage had a little spice to it but not hot. The chicken was very tender and delicious!

Coffee and a piece of tiramisu finished off the evening.

Not going to lie, but the location is not in the nicest part of town, but don't let that dissuade you from going to this amazing little Italian gem."}
{"text":"What an incredible experience!! I live in Los Angeles, but grew up here in Pittsburgh and look forward to eating here every time I come to town!! It's family-owned, high quality, prepared to order, authentic, and tastes like something you'd eat from grandma's kitchen. And the next door \"bakery\" with homemade donuts, eclairs, cannoli, cookies, and chocolate is delicious, too!! I dream of this food and am obsessed with so many food items they serve!!

My favorite foods are the homemade falagones, wedding soup, chicken romano, stuffed peppers, greens and beans, and eggplant!!!

Love love love!!"}
{"text":"The food is still delicious but... the waitress had on dirty clothing. The owner was out and about and never came over to our table.  Our party was one of two or three small parties.  It was not busy.  We had to ask for coffee, ask for dessert...we did get refills on water.  I felt sad."}
{"text":"The service is amazing.  They have fantastic food I've never been disappointed. My entire family can come here and everyone finds something they enjoy. I recommend the linguini in white clam sauce."}
{"text":"Over all pricey for that neighborhood but in line for the food.  The service was personable and accommodating. My comments were relayed to the kitchen and acknowledged. 
Why only 3 stars you may ask well the beans and greens had the bitter taste of using too much of the water used to boil the chard. The tripe was chewy and the lobster ravioli was salty in spots like the cook was saying my tripe is chewy f.u. have extra salt.
Next time I will try the muscles maybe."}
{"text":"Nice Italian restaurant. Byob with no corkage. We had Audette waiting on us who was very nice. Large portions and very good home made  Italian food. Good bread with a very good dipping sauce. Excellent veal and chicken dishes. Salad and wedding soup were very good.  Pretty cool looking restaurant. Would recommend."}
{"text":"If it was based on food alone I would easily give this place 5 stars. Everything I've ever had is delicious. Huge portions too. To be honest though the service is so close to being downright disrespectful at times that based on that, I would give a 2. I'm not
Someone who cares if it's taking awhile, or if the waitress is busy, or if a mistake is made. I work customer service and I completely understand these things. However, just be NICE. I agree with the gentleman who said when his wife called about the reservation how rude they were to him - I get the same treatment. They literally let out the biggest sigh and are sarcastic as hell. Just not cool. If they had a talk with customer service and they learned how to be polite., this place would be perfect."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian! This little gem gets 5 stars. It is a byob (which I love) and they DO have wine glasses. Maybe they didn't have them when they first opened, but they absolutely have them now. The food was to die for! There were 5 of us, and everything I tried was phenomenal!! Very clean, excellent service. Highly recommended, and defiantly plan on going back."}
{"text":"I've had lunch twice, the Italian food is really pretty good. It its very fresh and portion to price ratio is very good. The restaurant is a bit noisy and the neighborhood isn't improving, but the food is worth a trip, I'm still not sold on the bakery. It was better on my second trip but still really pricey."}
{"text":"1905 is PHENOMENAL!!!!! Everything was fantastic. Our server was so nice and kind, she always made sure we were comfortable and happy. The restaurant is small, so there's limited seating- make sure to get a reservation like we did. 

First, we had the greens and beans and fried calamari. Our server also brought out complimentary bread and dipping oil. The bread looked great, but unfortunately the gluten free diners can't have it. Bring your own bread if you are GF!! The dipping oil was excellent, same with the appetizers. The greens and beans broth was so buttery and rich, and the cheese on top was wonderful. The calamari and marinara was top-notch. 1905 knows how to make awesome marinara! Our salads (came with our entrees) were superb. Ask for blue cheese. 

The best part of all...PASTA. I had the Veal Suzanne. Oh my gosh. You have to try it. The veal was perfectly cooked and they have gluten free pasta!!!!!! It's GF penne, BTW. The portions are ginormous, they give you 8 ounces of veal and 12 ounces of pasta. That didn't stop me from eating it all, though. I was really hungry. For finishing of all my meal, they gave me a free slice of chocolate cake. The cake was divine- the frosting was heavenly, and it tasted like a chocolate paradise. 

I cannot wait to come back here. The restaurant is not in the nicest area of town, but I will come because of the food. I highly recommend 1905 to anyone who wants authentic Italian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Everyone was wonderful! The food was amazing best Italian food around and prices are extremely reasonable. My new favorite restaurant. Thanks for the great experience 1905!"}
{"text":"Nice little family run place with good food. They are a BYOB with no corkage fee which is nice!
The atmosphere is nice in a remodeled early 1900's building with period correct decor. The wait staff is nice and the chef stopped by to see how our food was. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Let's just say it wasn't the greatest experience...first off when my wife called for a reservation, that should have been he clue.  Not very nice and basically hung up on her.  Then when we did get there, it took about 20 minutes to get water.  Never did get any better.  Once we ordered, it took nearly 2 HOURS to get the food.  If it hadn't been for the people we we're with, we would have been out!  About an hour into the wait we were told that the owner was the ONLY person cooking and would not allow anyone to help, hint, hint, he never cooks she said.  Well, needless to say, if he doesn't cook, then I didn't trust that the meal would be right.  Well, food was ok, just not totally hot and we didn't even want to send it back because who knows how long it would've taken then!  So,  to help offset the long wait, they gave us dessert.  That wasn't too bad, but it will be a long time to never going back.  Because of the owner's actions, he lost some patrons.  I know it probably doesn't matter to him, but it does to us.  By the way, if I could have given 0 stars, I probably would have."}
{"text":"We are new to Pittsburgh so we have been taking suggestions from friends and friends of friends for new places to try.  We went to 1905 Eatery last night and we had a great experience.  We ordered 2 appetizers, the stuffed hot pepper and the beans and greens and both were wonderful.  The greens were garlicky and very flavorful and the peppers were good.  We ordered salads and one wedding soup.  The salads were good with a tasty dressing and I was told the soup was out of this world.  Our meals were plentiful and delicious.  We got 2 veal parms, shrimp scampi and carbonara with chicken cutlets.  The service was fast and friendly.  We met the owner and enjoyed chatting with him and hearing about how the restaurant got started.  Everyone agreed that this is a place we would come back to."}
{"text":"Totally a fan of this cozy, clean lil eatery serving wonderful italian food.  No skimping here on portions.  I've tried several dishes and havent been disappointed....except for some very mushy angel hair....which I love...but they graciously changed it out for linguine which was AWESOME!! Cooked perfectly al dente.  Their wedding soup, chicken parm, veal Romano, salads, grilled veggies on the appetizer menu...YUM!!! You cannot go wrong. Call for reservation, especially on the weekends, packed. Workers very sweet, very 'homey' feel. I love the BYOB, and no price gouging for the cork fee...it's FREE!! I will be a frequent flyer!!"}
{"text":"Yummy. Loved it here. Just tried it tonight love the fact of byob and no fee. We had the fried calimari. It was very good. The wedding soup was also tastey. For dinner I had the gnocchi Tuscany. That sauce was so good I could have lick the plate. My partner had the chicken parm. Which the portions are huge. The chicken was excellent moist and a nice breading. The sauce was really good. Overall I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Food was a 9.5 (delicious, huge portions) 
Ambiance was a 6 (clean, but very noisy)
Service was a solid 4 (and pretty weird, tbh)"}
{"text":"This is an update to my original post. Found ourselves out and about with friends on a Saturday night. They suggested 1905. I held my tongue, given my first experience....but they were persistent and raving about it. We called enroute...it was 8:30ish, knowing they would be closing soon. The owner was welcoming and said they'd wait for us. We arrived a few minutes later and were treated very well, given the late timing. We had wonderful bread with dipping oil and beans/greens to start. Both were plentiful and delicious. My husband had a veal/pepper dish, I had white clam sauce, friends had pasta primavera and a chicken dish. All were huge, hot and well prepared. I am converted."}
{"text":"1905 is one of those restaurants that offers good food and friendly service.  On our recent visit I had the Crab ravioli with some veggies; think it was a daily special.  While I enjoyed the ravioli it seemed to just be OK, I guess I was expecting more flavor.  The meal came with a tossed salad and some fresh bread.    
1905 is small and noisy.  There was a table of 12 that was very noisy."}
{"text":"We had a large group, about 22 people, from our wine class for dinner. Everyone loved the food. We had a set menu. Loved the Eggplant Parm, Chicken Picatta and Veal Marsala.   All were great.  You get large portions and spaghetti with some of the dishes.  It's byob and they don't charge a corkage fee. The service was good. I highly recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times.   It has been great every time!  Great authentic Italian food. 
Lots of choices on the menu. 
You cannot go wrong with any thing they have to offer. 
I would recommend the Eatery to anyone who enjoys delicious food. 
Great friendly service too!"}
{"text":"Service was a little slow with one server, but the food was excellent! Can't wait to get home to try their desserts."}
{"text":"It didn't live up to the hype as the food was not hot enough and the service was inflexible to do something slightly off the menu. There are a lot of better BYOB places in the Burgh."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night for the first time. Food was great and portions were large. It's a byob with no corkage fees. Service was very good. One of the owners brought home made cookies and chocolate turtles to our table. The owners couldn't have been any nicer. I would absolutely go back there again. It might be wise to make a reservation because the restaurant is on the small size"}
