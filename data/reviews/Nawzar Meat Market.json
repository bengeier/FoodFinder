{"text":"The food is too good to mind the attitude!  It's been 12 years that I'm going to this place and the quality is still high.  Keep it up.
Try the ground beef kabab\"koobideh\" and the stews...."}
{"text":"I was going to try China Cottage and then parked in front of Nawzar Meat Market and decided to try it instead. The meat at the BBQ section looked super fresh and I ordered 2 chicken skewers with rice. While I was waiting I took a look at their butcher section and their cuts also looked great. All the meat looked really great and I ordered a half dozen chicken legs to cook for home. 
When getting home with my food, the chicken legs smelled fresh and I marinated them using some pomegranate molasses that I got from the shop.
The BBQ meat was excellent. A couple of things that make it stand out compared to other places is that the meat is fresh and not frozen, it is well-seasoned and not too spicy, and also the cooking time on the grill is excellent and not too long. This is my new favorite spot in the area for sure!"}
{"text":"Oh my god. My mind has officially been blown. I don't know how there aren't already reviews for this place on Yelp?!? 

Discovered this place after dinner one night at the Thai place next door, and vowed to come back another time. It's a meat, not \"meet\" shop, first and foremost. Lots of Chicken and Lamb parts in the back.

However, when you walk in there is a beautiful hot table display of amazing Persian Fare. Beautiful jewel-like rices piled high and adorned with Barberries and Saffron, a collection of stews and veggies. Everything looked incredibly tempting! There are also a selection of raw kebabs on display that you can get grilled to order.

I got the Chicken Shish Kebab on bread (Pita) with vegetables. Like OMG, best Persian Kebab I have ever eaten in my entire life!!!! Totally puts Shomal (North) to shame. And at $7, I really felt like I was robbing the place. Such amazing value!

I also got the Baghali Polo (Rice with Dill and Fava Beans) and Mahiche (Stewed Lamb Shank). Just brilliant! The lamb was fall of the bone tender, and the rice was wonderfully fragrant. So yummy! And damn, the portion was HUGE! Only $8 for that bad boy!

I am really looking forward to my next visit here. Remember guys, this is a takeout only place, so don't come with your aunts and uncles hoping for a sit-down meal ;D"}
{"text":"sooooooooooooo good, fresh, quality, inexpensive...
this is a butcher for fantastic halal meats, but above that, is their grilled m eats and hot table of Persian foods that will blow your mind... I LOVE  coming here for lunch, I can't think of a better place in the city for grill and Persian food at this price"}
{"text":"If you are having guests at your house and looking for persian kabab,  or any persian dishes this is your destination , the food is amazng and the staff are really  nice ."}
{"text":"I didn't know how to order as I entered there was a line up and a man eating rice in a cup lol I think he got a sample of the green rice with favsa beans....the green color rice. It attracted my attention so I got it with grilled chicken...thry said to wait 10 minutes...total was $11. I had to order to the guys who were cooking and then pay yo the lady at the cashier.
I even saw the Persian ice CREAM sandwich which is yummy I had it long time back. It's like waffles with ice cream in it....must try. Refrigerator is on the right hand side....as you enter."}
{"text":"Hurray for Yelp! I never knew what the name of this place was. I too walked in here randomly, saw the hot table, and fell in love. I'm a small little Chinese girl, so walking in here was like being a fish out of water. So much to try, and try I did. 

My absolute favorites are the ghormeh sabzi (almost like a spinach stew with meat chunks in it) and the dill rice (with kidney beans). The two together come out to $7 flat. If they have it, ask for the tahdeeg (almost like crispy rice from the bottom of the pan they cooked the rice in). It's free of charge (with purchase, presumably) and it's incredibly tasty. A tad oily, cuz all the flavorings and whatnot they put in when they cook the rice drips down and soaks into that bottom layer of crispy rice, but it's totally worth it! My second recommendation would be their beef kebabs (2 skewers) with choice of rice, tomato, onion, pickle for $8 flat. If you order their chicken kebab, you only get one skewer.

Should they have it, their lamb soup is pretty tasty too.

Portions are generous. Takeout place. No tables, not much space.

Meat market in back. If you don't like to see what animal you're eating, don't go there. =)"}
{"text":"We used to eat takeout n buy meat as well.... but stopped  going there completely when the owner was being abusive to the girl working there n then he was so rude to me when i tried to talk... they need to treat their employees n customers better...and the guy needs to show respect to women....such a shame!!"}
{"text":"This is a middle-eastern grocery/meat market that has a takeout hot food counter and a bbq station. I come here for the kabob and it is the gold standard I compare everything else to. They have beef and chicken,  cooked to perfection on charcoal. I always get the basmati with lima beans and dill. The rice is perfectly cooked and so fluffy. You can get the kabob with rice or bread, if just bread you get 2 pieces. You still get a half piece bread with rice. With each kabob meal you also get grilled tomatoes, raw white onion and a wedge of lemon. Kabob with rice is $10 (all in). This place never disappoints!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing rice selection and kebab style meats but the biggest down fall is that there is no menu and bad customer service. All three times I went they gave us attitude (made us wait like 20mins before making and order, rude) and all we wanted to do was order some good takeout. Such a shame for such good food but guess I have to go elsewhere to not be treated that way."}
{"text":"Fantastic little meat (they spell Meat wrong) shop and hot food place.

Nawzar is run by this friendly eccentric owner who really made a place like this welcoming. As soon as you walk in, you'll realize there's very little room to maneuver around. The place is narrow where the hot foods and kebabs are up front while the meats and some dry goods are in the back of the place. 

The smell of the BBQ is what lured me here. They use a charcoal grill inside to cook some of the many kebobs they have displayed for you. For $8, you're getting a giant chicken skewer and a large takeout box of rice and bread. The chicken skewers take some time (20 min) so take a nice walk around if you have to or call in advance. 

The chicken meat is so tender and juicy. That charcoal aroma is the epitome of what summer should entail. The meat is lightly seasoned but the chicken and the charcoal do all they need to. They also have other kinds of kebabs, but chicken breast is so damn good. Other hot food items include lamb shanks, chicken leg quarters, and spaghetti (Persian kind?). The rice mixtures they have are good such as cranberry rice, veggie, and lentil rice. 

When coming here, you can't leave without picking up something to eat. The hot foods counter looks good early, but can be a bit of a downer the later in the evening you go so come early. The weekends can be pretty packed so be ready. Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area as there aren't many great places around."}
{"text":"These guys grill kebabs to order on charcoal.  I have expert bbq and grill skills and was pleasantly surprised with the high quality of the kebab.  Nicely charred on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside.  My chicken kebab was a generous size and served on top of seasoned rice & beans with 2 small pickles, a small red chili, onion chunk and a halved and grilled tomatoe.  A lemon wedge and thin bread came in the container as well.  At $11 incl tax this was a steal.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place seems totally random to get some take out but it's SO GOOD. It's in a plaza and looks like just a small grocery store but it has a hot table of amazing eats as well. 

The store is lined with a huge variety of fresh breads which are all very tasty. I got the beef kebob (come with 2 skewers) which comes with rice (your choice of 3: fava bean and dill, dried cranberry, or plain) I got the cranberry which goes surprisingly well with all the savoury flavours. It also comes with a charbroiled tomato, onion, warm pita, and a cucumber pickle, all of this for $8.

FOOD GOOD so why only 3 stars? Food was good and the portions were hearty but it's not like my life is now complete that I've eaten here - it's good and simple. The one downer is this place feels like a secret kebab club. There is no indication on where you place your order and there is no menu or menu board. I kind of stood there looking confused trying to order not to be acknowledged by someone for a good 6 minutes which is a long time to stare a someone looking bewildered in a semi empty store."}
{"text":"I have only bought there Rice, curry ,  & Kabob. Awesome place, Food is mind blowing, very Tasty. 

very very Great Service,"}
{"text":"Half grocery and half take-out food joint. There is no menu to order from. You just order what they have somehow. Got a beef kabob with rice. Meal comes with flat bread, pickle, grilled tomato, rice and two skewers of beef kabob. All this for $9 taxes in. Beef was soft and tender. Flavours were amazing. Very filling meal."}
{"text":"The food is very fresh as they grill your meat to order at the shop. The food at the hot plate station was very fresh too- three different types of rice, some more meats, beans, and a pasta dish of sorts. It's quite difficult to order since there is no menu or food labels to know what the dishes are. The man behind the counter was nice though didn't seem to have the patience to really explain. We got beef skewers and chicken skewers - one as a rice plate (came with a large serving of rice, half a pita, a quarter grilled tomato and a quarter raw onion) and a bread plate (two full pitas, a quarter grilled tomato, a quarter raw onion, and fresh dill)"}
{"text":"Yes this is still under the category of fast food or takeout if you buy their kebabs or their premade entrees.  There is no place to eat what you order on their premises, so essentially it is takeout only.  But for such a small shop space, you can order food, get some Persian/Iranian groceries (even those gorgeously large pistachios), and their meat market has marinaded BBQ meat ready for the grill.  Of course, you can take it home and you could make just a sample to see if you want to add anything more in its seasoning to suit your tastes but still, what a time saver!  They do sell their metal skewers should you need some to BBQ what meat you bought there.  Their prices are reasonable and you will definitely be full or have leftovers."}
{"text":"Good luck finding this place if you search online. 
Hole in a wall kinda place. Just like one review, it is a secret kebab club. No menus anywhere. Just come in, order your dead grilled animal (either chicken &/or beef) with rice combo and work your way on to the cashier. Wait for your cooked animals and enjoy. Food is fresh and it tastes great."}
