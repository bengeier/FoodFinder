{"text":"Why are the falafels not kept behind glass? This was my go to lunch until I found a nice curly hair stuck to one in my meal. Disgusted and will not return"}
{"text":"Food is really tasty and fresh at this place. There's always a lineup during lunch hours, but they are really fast at taking you in and out."}
{"text":"This place used to be called Sammy's Gourmet. I don't know the details behind the name change, but all of the same people are still there. If you've been to Sammy's before but haven't seen it since, they've really gone through a huge makeover.  They specialize in salads and chicken. They also have fish, grilled tofu, and falafel. For the most part, I come here for the grilled chicken, whether it's in a box with rice, potatoes, and salad, or sometimes in a wrap if you feel like getting something you can eat on the go.  It is always busy during lunch time. Expect to be in a line of 10-15 people. However, they have 3 or 4 people taking orders and have really streamlined the process so that you can go through your order in less than a minute: what chicken do you want? Rice or potatoes? Mushroom sauce? NEXT  For under $10, you can get a nice big box of food with a pretty big piece of grilled chicken. It is understandable why this place is always busy."}
{"text":"The BEST food court outlet in the financial district. A great alternative to the usual chains (i.e. ManchWok, Jimmy, Pumpernickel, IQ etc.) Freshly grilled chicken available in a variety of different flavors with a plethora of tasty and healthy sides ranging from brown rice to mango salad. All of this for $10 - what more could you want for a quick lunch option in the financial district?"}
{"text":"Juicy chicken...in a food court??? No, your eyes and mouth do not deceive you. Look at that line stretching all the way down the hall. Look at the consensus across all of the reviews. Do you need more validation?  The concept seems simple but is such a rare find in a food court. Fresh-cooked food, variety, fast service, good portion sizes, and affordable prices. It's the holy grail of food court finds. It's like Chipotles but with salads and without norovirus. No wonder this is the most popular place in the court. They serve up the fast-paced financial district crowd with super efficiency.   If you're new to the Harvest Green experience and feeling overwhelmed, they've got pre-determined options for you like the Cajun Chicken Cobb Salad, or the Fish Taco salad. Modifications are allowed. Or pick and choose from the proteins and bases yourself.   Of their ingredient list, chicken is clearly the star of the show. They've got like 10 different flavours of chicken (Tandoori, Honey Garlic, Peri-peri, etc.), lightly fried fish, and falafels for our vegetarian friends. Basic bases at no extra cost include brown rice, potatoes, romaine, KALE, and all types of salad dressing. You see how excited I got with kale? Usually they mark that stuff up now that it's a \"superfood\", but not here! Premium salads include mango salad, tuna salad, bean salad...and so on.   But you know what, who cares? Mix and match however you like, it's ALL delicious! The chicken is flavourful and tender, the salads are super fresh. Orders are filled so quickly, your meat is always hot off the grill. And no matter what, it usually comes in around $10, which is basically the same as a combo meal at McDs. You don't need to break bank to eat healthy. There's hope for fast food after all!

{"text":"DuuuUuuUUuUde! This place is the PLACE. I thought I was dreaming! So good!! It's in the path - honestly I can't really direct you here but I know the path I take to get here.. only. There's always a line FOR GOOD REASON - it's bomb af. & don't worry, their assembly line method the staff use is SO effective. It's never taken me longer than 5 minutes to get my food.  I've only tried one thing here and that's the only thing I need. F A L A F E L P L A T E ... aka heaven. Two sides I choose - salad with sweet spicy thai dressing + rice with the mushroom sauce. Oh my geeerrrd, every bite was worth every macro. The falafel balls, let me tell you - they're the hugest falafel pieces I've ever seen in my life. Like, the size of a fist. It's crispy on the outer layer and warm fluffy goodness on the inside. Every vegetarian/vegan's DREAM.  Also, did I mention the portions are huge?!?!?! Like.. food coma huge.. for $7-8. Every time I forget to pack lunch, I come here. Right in the financial district across RBC. Convenient, fast and cheap. #thatswhatshesaid  Ugh, don't ever change, harvest green, don't ever change."}
{"text":"Ok, horrible!  The service was not good at all! We literally saw the place on Yelp and it happened to be close by. The reviews bought us.  The only reason I give two stars is the location with a very nice food court.  Our food was dry and we had a very hard time explaining what exactly we wanted. Servers had no idea what dairy-free is and couldn't confirm anything. Come on, aren't you in the food industry?  They were rude and rushed us through the check-out.  I mean, I get it. It's a food court. You shouldn't be expecting much. But hey, why do you have 4 stars then?!"}
{"text":"The PATH's best kept secret! The protein options - chicken, fish, tofu etc. - are extremely fresh and served in generous portions! Always tender never dry unlike a lot of fast-food options.   They offer a TON of bang for your buck in the side options when building your own plate. I selected a mango salad (my favourite) which was one of the best I've ever had AND a generous portion of quinoa in addition to my protein. A huge plate of tasty and clean food for....wait for it...nine. dollars. I almost turned around because I thought it was a mistake! This is my second visit to Harvest Green but definitely not my last!"}
{"text":"Only been here once, but you can tell by the lineup that this place is the coolest kid at lunch.  Serving healthy, but affordable and fresh food, this place is a gem. The line up is also quick, so what's there not to love?  I got the chicken platter for just about $9 incl tax. Unlike the other food court food, this chicken was NOT DRY but actually juicy.  There's a variety of options from fish to falafel. From what I can tell from the chicken and from friends, getting lunch here makes you feel satisfied but not too full, so you'll be hungry in time for dinner.  You can have that burger king across anytime - go for harvest green."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an alternative from the usual salad places (i.e. Freshii, Fast Fresh, IQ), this place is definitely worth a try. The quantity and quality that come with their salads is phenomenal! For the price you pay, the portions are huge. Probably the most affordable lunch you can get in the downtown core.  I tried their signature salads, the cajun cobb and the honey bowl. The salads themselves are jam packed with ingredients, finished off with a generous piece of freshly grilled chicken. This place is unquestionably a bang for the buck!  Located in the metro concourse food court on Wellington. The lines may look a bit intimidating at first but it does move quick.   Highly recommend this place! And I will definitely be going back :)"}
{"text":"A very good food court option!    This is a breakfast I look forward to when I run out of the house without eating. Not very often but it is really nice to have the backup.   The reason I like the place?  They cook the food in front of you. Fresh. And they are good with exclusions like, no butter or margarine.   Standard fare for me is the egg sandwich with an over easy egg with lettuce and tomatoes on rye bread. Filling and reasonably healthy. And all for $3.40.   They are fast and the employees are pretty nice."}
{"text":"When I came by yesterday there were about 8 people ahead but, the line went super quick. Try to figure out what you want ahead of time and everyone will be a bit more appreciative because it is during the lunch rush!  Ordered the spicy grilled tofu with tahini and hummus on top, roasted potatoes with mushroom sauce and mango salad.   The tofu was tasty and spicy. The mushroom sauce on the potatoes was so good! Mango salad was sweet and crunchy.  Overall the whole meal was pretty filling and total cost for a grilled tofu lunch was less than $9.  The quinoa salad and the Greek salad looked fresh and delicious!   The person ahead of me and the two people behind me ordered the Cobb salad - seems like a popular pick maybe il give that a try next time."}
{"text":"This is the hidden gem of salads in the PATH. The lines are deceptively long at lunch, but the staff are very efficient so the wait is less than 5 minutes. Meals come out to under $11-12 incl. tax and will leave you very satisfied.  You can either choose a pre-made bowl or choose your own ingredients (base, protein, toppings) My go-to is the Honey Bowl when I'm too lazy to choose all the different options.  Honey Bowl ($9.55) - kale base, honey garlic chicken, and toppings like sunflower seeds and dried currants - the dressing is a honey lemon vinaigrette which keeps the salad light and refreshing  Their chicken is GREAT. It's never dry, and always very flavourful. I've tried several of the flavours and they've all been pretty good.  They definitely need to open another one in a more central PATH location but this one is still close enough to most office buildings being in the underground of the Metro Hall. In the meantime, make the walk to Harvest Green for lunch. It's well worth it."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. It's a frequent lunch place for my coworkers and I. I always get a plate with rice and extra mushroom sauce (to die for) as well as the kale salad and honey garlic chicken. I've tried a few of their flavoured chicken but I still always get their honey garlic one. honestly, it's so filling with such large portions and it's not too expensive. It's less than $10 for a plate.  The kale salad is so good I usually get it with balsamic dressing. The entire meal just makes me feel a lot healthier than usual.   The line up is always long but for a good reason but it does move very quickly. I don't even know what I'm going to do if I work too far since I believe they only have one location. Gotta cherish it while I can."}
