{"text":"delish! went here last night while visiting the city, found it on YELP of course. it was yummy and the service was great! i got the wasabi roll and the crispy salmon roll. both awesome. but..... and there is always a but. the bathroom smelled like someone had upper decked  the toilet tank and it had been sitting there a while. but other than that good experience. just hold it til ya get back to your hotel."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Toronto! I've had sushi all over the city and this place has by far the best sushi. Why? I'll tell you why. It's the rice. That's right. The rice makes the sushi. If you got nasty, over-sticky rice, you've got nasty sushi. The sushi at CR is JUST right, and the quality is evident in the food. The atmosphere is casual and fun and the staff is friendly and attentive. Great for a fun sushi dinner with friends."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I've got friends who are ALLL OVER this joint, like to the point of naming it \"HQ\". But me? Ehhhhhhn. I'll go there to eat with you, sure, but if I'm gonna have sushi, I'll take it to the streets instead. I just said that to sound hardcore. I meant I'll take it to HoSu or something.  Maybe the problem is with me. To be honest, I've only had the sushi once, and I didn't love it. Maybe I should give it another try. After my sub-par feasting, I went through this phase where I only wanted bland foods, and so I'd go in and order like, rice, edamame and miso soup. I know, I know, what the funk. Sometimes I just feel like rice, okay?!  But I must admit, lately I remembered that chicken exists and Lo!! The chicken teriyaki is AWESOME. Comes with zucchini and broccoli (my faves!!) and perfect steamed rice. You're growing on me, Crispy Roll... now, should I give the sushi another try?  Best Friend Edit: \"I can't believe you're sending people to HoSu instead. You're crazy.\""}
{"text":"This is another one of my \"I am surprised these guys don't have a better overall rating\" reviews. I should make a list.  Anyways, as aforementioned.. why not a higher rating? I used to visit CR more often when I lived nearby, and liked it. I visited again yesterday as I wanted some udon soup and was nearby. Still Good! Yelped from the table and was surprised.  CR has consistently higher quality fish. I generally don't like these low-cost sushi places for fish and usually grab veggie sushi. Here, I find the fish to be fresh and tasty, never had a problem. Their Udon Soup is really good, and my SO (who lived in Japan) thought the Katsu Don was good. It had the egg on it, lending to authenticity.  The \"Crispy\" rolls are tasty. The tuna has tobiko, crunchy bits, spicy mayo and cucumber.  The hamachi maki has spring onion which is a nice touch.  The service is ok. Theres always a lot of \"hanging out\" and \"having fun\" amongst the staff - meaning I don't get my tea refilled as much as I like but whatever. Its cheap and the lunch specials are decent.   For Cheap, Fresh, Decent Quality, Queen St Sushi this is the place to go.  They do delivery.  3.5 -- 4 stars to be given if I ever get more than one tea refill and if they switch to reusable chopsticks."}
{"text":"Sorry Connie, I don't agree with your review.  But then again, I have never ordered the garlic pepper beef stir-fry. I'm certain if I was chewing on gristle or fat, then I would feel the same and not bother coming back.  BUT ME LOVES ME SOME SUSHI! And Crispy Roll is where I often get my sushi fix. (If I were rich than I would be at Ki (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/ki-sushi-toronto) all the time, but sadly I'm not a lottery winner yet.)  You won't be able to wipe off my smile as I eat the seaweed salad, spicy hamachi sushi pizza and spicy salmon crispy roll.  They know me by face and my ego loves how the waitress disregards and removes the reserved sign at the booth for me. Ha! LOVE IT! :)  Fine, I may be biased because they slightly spoil me, but I always return to places that treat me ooh ooh soo good!"}
{"text":"Red rice inari maki set!!!  Inari is fried tofu - and the version served at Crispy Roll is slightly sweet and all deliciousness.  For $7.99 plus tax and tip, I indulged in a set of delicious avocado cucumber rolls, avocado inari crispy rolls (the 'crispy' is tempura flakes rolled into the maki) and a pouch made from inari and stuffed with red rice and sesame seeds - all this plus salad and miso soup.  The red rice was also quite the unique indulgence.  I wasn't in the mood for fish and this healthy vegetarian maki set left me smiling and absolutely satisfied.  Much love!"}
{"text":"6 international visits later, having most of the rolls on their menu, and becoming personable with the chefs, I now have enough information to make a review. So let's get started.  Firstly.. I don't know what it is about the sushi places in Canada with people not wanting to sit at the bar. I've walked past, stepped in, and glanced over more than enough places and each time the bar has been empty. Call me strange, but this is the best place to be. You can interact with your cook, you can ask him questions about what he recommends, and you can even watch what he is doing.  It's all quite fascinating. That being said. the first time my fianc√©e and I were here and I sat down at the bar, the servers all stared at me like I had 3 heads. \"Take out?\" she asked. \"No We're eating in\". \"Table?\" was her next line. \"No thank you I enjoy the bar\".. \"You sure?\".....\"Absolutely\" I would love to tell you this was the first time it happened, however it occurred 2 more times until they began to recognize who we were. Now the cook sees us, smiles, makes a nod at the bar inquisitively, I confirm with a smile and a nod of my own, and he waves off the servers. It's kind of become a quiet conversation between us.   The routine has become pretty safe at this point.  I choose 2 rolls, 1 Appetizer and then give the chef free reign to make me 1 item of his choosing. Out of all the different App/Salad choices I have seen the 2 that I found quite tasty over the others would be the Mangosa Salad and Evi Avocado Salad.   In terms of the actual Rolls offered I have yet to order any that are bad. On top of the ones on the sheet, I cannot remember the ones made for us that were not on the menu but were of the chefs own creation. Particular rolls that come to mind, Dynamite, Spider, Green Spider, Dragon, (All Maki) I have ordered each one of their own \"Crispy Roll\" selections and they are all stellar. I can't really think of anything negative with the exception of needing to have that awkward moment from when I walk in and sit at the bar and get stared at like I am growing a third eye. Hit this place up, definitely."}
{"text":"Crispy Roll is now officially added to my FAVE SUSHI PLACES in Toronto!  When I was working as a PR gal for MuchMusic and MTV, I was in walking distance to Crispy Roll and had my first taste of their delicious sushi on a lunch break one day.  Since switching jobs, I haven't had as much Crispy but since moving downtown, I am close to this amazing place again and cannot get enough!  In my most recent visit to this wonderful place, my boyfriend and I had a delicious dinner of sushi!  We split 6 rolls, which are ones I would totally recommend:  - Crispy Wasabi Roll (Crab, Salmon, Avocado with spicy tempura bits and Wasabi mayo)  - Crispy Hamachi Roll (A mix of fish meats with green onion, Avocado and tempura bits with mayo sauce)  - Crispy Salmon Roll (A fresh yummy salmon roll with crunch tempura goodness)  - Crispy Tuna Roll (Same format as the salmon with the crunchy deliciousness)  - Spicy Salmon (So fresh and delicious, one of the best I have tried)  - Crispy Rainbow Roll (The inside is like a California roll, with tempura bits and finished off with different fishes wrapped around the outside)   The BEST rolls at this place though include the word \"CRISPY\" in its title, hence the name CRISPY ROLL!  With the 6 rolls my boyfriend and I ordered, the bill came to $36, which I would say is very reasonable for 6 HUGE rolls, with 6 to 8 pieces per roll.  Go and enjoy the crispy, crunch and freshness of Crispy Roll!"}
{"text":"STOP RIGHT THERE - turn around and run, don't walk towards Queen and Spadina. Head past the intersection about 2 blocks (past the American Apparel) and on the lefthand side you'll see Aji Sai Sushi.  All the same stuff (and I dare say more variety with cooler rolls) and all you can eat for, get this, $20.99!! Save yourself a ton o' cash and eat just as awesomely 5 minutes down the road. Who knew???  P.S. you're welcome :D"}
{"text":"On a Saturday evening at 6pm, the place was pretty quiet.  The food was delicious but the service was a little on the disappointing side.  My friend and I ordered a couple of dishes to share (Rainbow Dynamite rolls, Spicy Crispy Salmon Rolls, Gyoza).  All of that was great :)  The problem came when we asked for salad.  Granted, there was a language barrier so they didn't get that we both wanted miso soup and salad.  So, they brought us one of each, we clarified what we wanted and they brought us Wakame salad.  It wasn't what we wanted but we thought that it was complimentary.  When the bill came, we realized that they had charged us for the Wakame salad, which we didn't ask for.  After arguing with them about it - we didn't order it but ate it because we thought it was complimentary - they agreed to take it off the bill.  Also, the server took forever to come to our table.  Would I go again?  The food was terrific and I figure you can't blame someone for a language barrier so, definitely returning!"}
{"text":"The sushi was pretty great, but I found everything else to be slightly bland. Pricing is pretty decent, and the interior is very cute. Service was good. Overall, a pretty solid place, but not nearly the best sushi in the city.  I wouldn't hesitate to go back, but on the sushi-packed Queen Str W, it definitely wouldn't be the first place that comes to mind, either."}
{"text":"Find sushi elsewhere.  Good sushi is hard to come by off the coasts (and arguably outside of Japan!). The chef at the Queen St. Crispy Roll is Cantonese. Staff is a mix of mainland Chinese and Cantonese. (Race doesn't matter, just setting the tone.) Service was mediocre. They lost the sushi part of our order, despite us being the only customers in the joint at lunch time. The food took over 20 minutes from when we sat down despite us being the only customers. The staff was chatting and cursing in Chinese. You can walk by this place at lunch and notice they rarely have customers.  Had a dynamite roll, some nigiri, and katsu don. We had to explain to the waitress what nigiri was. (Between my friends and I we spoke English, Japanese, and Chinese. Not sure where the communication problem was.)   The katsu don was a bit soggy and overly fried -- they may have refried it after screwing up our order.  The salmon nigiri was nothing special and the fish fell off the rice. Yes, there was wasabi there, but the rice wasn't sticky enough.  The roll was okay, not too great. I'm wondering if we had the wrong chefs, since the other Yelp reviews are fairly positive?"}
{"text":"I've come here many times and all I remember is that their menu is in comic sans. Also, they have these weird bobbing head toys near the entrance. Also, also, their washrooms are subpar. Also, also, also: they have these cozy booths with tall backs that make them almost private. But most also of all? They serve sushi here. And it's fine.  Not great, not bad, not terrible, not awesome. It's A-OK. A good standby if you are looking for affordable eats on Queen West. I just barely kind of sort of recommend this place.  Obligatory Title Pun: Yeah, CRISPY ROLL/Lemme see that CRISPY ROLL  Menu Readability: Comic sans.  Need to mention: It's not as bad as other reviewers will have you think. But not as good either.  What this place teaches me about myself: I'm kind of torn on this place. Can you tell?"}
