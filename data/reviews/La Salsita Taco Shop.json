{"text":"Fantastic, cheap tacos. Quick service and friendly. Great for take out. You can't go wrong with any of the meat selections and the salsas are serviceable. I haven't had a chance to try the platters or other dishes as the tacos are so good!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. FRESH HOMEMADE Horchata!! Nothing powder and fake like other places. 

The carne asada tacos are delicious. The caldo is a wonderful treat that taste just like your mother made it. I recently had the menudo and I will rate 
it a 3 star. Needs a bit more sal and just a punch of a little more hotter red chile. Although, I would buy it again. All in all, this place leaves Filibertos or any \"Betos\" places like Filibertos, macayos, garcias, south of the border, etc......in the DUST!!!

The place is clean and  there is an outdoor sitting area as well. The staff is friendly and the music gives the place a nice touch."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times and I can now make an honest review.

The parking lot is small and at first spot is not very \"inviting\" and it's no fancy place so if that's your thing, seek elsewhere.  Yes, it's probably open but u have to pull hard on that door as it won't budge easy and it fools you that's it's close.  This Salsitas here is more of an old fashioned traditional taste fast food restaurant where appearances are priority 3, taste is 2 and profits is their 1st.

This is something you might not be aware of but when  it comes to your sweet tooth Salsitas got your covered....from Fresas con Crema (strawberries and creme) all the way to Escamochas (no translation on this tasty treat).

The food is great but the taste still not all the way authentic.  You can still appreciate the effort and enjoy the food and if you haven't taste the true original traditional Mexican flavors, you will love this place.  As for me, the ratings will still remain at 3 stars as I've been exposed to absolute originals from the mother land.
One fact that pushed me away from Salsitas, at least from this location, was the assistance of an uninvited crawler on the wall; yes...u guessed right, it was a small roach!  I saw it by the wall close to the exit door. -_- Far away from the kitchen but close enough to keep me away from this location.
The tables are old and they wobble and their look is out of date, as I mentioned, their appearance is not their 1st priority, I might be wrong, but it's how it appears.

In a nutshell, Salsitas has a great variety of food with taste improving opportunities, authentic Aguas frescas, sweet heavenly snacks and a lack of concern for cleanliness and equipment failure.

If u can get past the thought of the roach on the wall,  do give it a shot...as for me, it's the only thing keeping me away as I don't mind the wobbly table nor the outdated look, but I'll b going to a different spot.
I'm hoping that after this review they take care of that issue as all places have the ability to be better and become great as I know this spot can be.

Well, may the taste Gods be on your side.  'til next time."}
{"text":"Great food from a nice little place a little off the beaten track.

We have been here for lunch a few times. The tacos were authentic and very good, as were the salsas. Kids meals (quesedillas) were huge and they loved them.

Good value overall."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous Mexican food! I stayed in the area for two weeks and visited four times. All the food is delicious, great service and great prices!"}
{"text":"so far one of my favorite places to eat.  i always get sopes which are alot bigger than the other salsitas in the area."}
{"text":"The taco al pastor is the best i've had. They only serve it on weekends and its made to order. The al pastor meat is slowly spining on a spit and the cook cut the meat as the order comes in. 

The carne asada burrito is grilled on charcoal and not cooked on a flat top so it has that chared smoky flavor unlike most carne asada around where its cooked on a flat top. This maybe the best mexican restaurant in my opinion. This is my go to mexican restaurant. F*** filiberto!"}
{"text":"I go here for the authentic mexican flavors.cabesa,chile verde,buche,lengua,al pastor,asada always on.point in my.book.shrimp.may be overpriced but im.here for tacos and  burritos most.of.the time.love it when.i eat inside and.get the hand.crafted tortillas.well.they taste like fresh made tortillas.whe.im.craving Mexican tacos .ill be there"}
{"text":"Very clean spot.  Well maintained salsa bar and carne trays.  Meats all cooked to perfection.  No complaints."}
{"text":"Food is just good!...almost remind me of home (Cali) from the menudo to the nachos...everything was on point"}
{"text":"Best Asada Tacos ive had around this side of town!! The asada had the grilled taste a taco should have and homemade tortillas , all the fixins available.... rice is on point for me im jus happy i found this place... open late too."}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican food in the valley. Everything is 100% authentic Mexican food. Can't say enough about this restaurant. Really tastes likes Mom's cooking."}
{"text":"Do not let the look of the building turn you away, the food here is amazing. Food is always amazingly flavorful, and fresh tasting. The staff are very polite, are willing to take special requests that aren't on the menu and make excellent recommendations. 

The carne asada burrito is my favorite thing on the menu. The meat is spiced, marinated and grilled on site. It comes with guacamole and pico de gallo, I usually just get it with the pico (not a huge fan of avocados) - tastes amazing! They have a fresh salsa bar with lots of toppings you can add to the burrito or what ever you decide to order - the smokey red salsa is incredible. 

People I've taken tree have also loved the el pastor tacos, breakfast burritos, and many other items."}
{"text":"I ate here with my mom because we were hungry and looking for something on mc85. I got a quesadilla with shredded beef and it was the biggest quesadilla I've ever seen. There was more meat than cheese and it was big enough that a fork and knife were required. I was really hungry when we got there and was feeling full after I finished the first slice. I also had a churro and it was the best."}
{"text":"How is this place even open for business. How can anyone eat in a so called restaurant with a bug infestation. Please guys get your restaurant up to code. While attempting to eat my breakfast burrito I saw a few roaches climb the table and fall on my lap. Where even afraid to come out during daylight. 
Man o man I hope the owners of this place take this review and do something. I can't even imagine how they got their license to operate."}
{"text":"Best food ever. My family loves this place. Amazing food. The workers are always super nice too. I recommend it to anyone who loves real Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great tasting food!!!! Best tacos I've have had in the Phoenix area!!! I recently moved here from a border city and this is as close as it gets to traditional Mexican food. They have fresh food, great tasting salsas and a very friendly staff! Open 24 hours on the weekends"}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant, but the food is good. I had great service as well. I had some carnitas tacos and a shrimp cocktail. I love that they are not cheap with the all the extras when pretty much everywhere else is. The tacos came with grilled onion and a grilled Serrano pepper on the side and the shrimp cocktail came with lots of avocado, no extra charge. And they have a salsa bar with radish and carrots plus the salsas they have are tasty. Good place to eat!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever, never plan on going back to this salsitas at least. They took our order and added extra charges for things that already come in the food, when we asked about the charges they told us that's what we ordered. We did not question it, then we got our food and the order wasn't even correct. Just a terrible experience they workers didn't even seem to care. Would not recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Best tacos! Always fast service and great salsa! My official taco spot! Yummy rice too!"}
{"text":"It was good food, a little over priced compared to similar places. Beans and rice were good."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best damn burritos around. I have been craving carne asada burritos a lot lately and this place always comes thru. 

It fills my fat kid self up. It looks like a little hole in the wall but you should give it a chance. 

The staff have always been so friendly with us and for the price it can't be beat."}
{"text":"Wasn't bad but wasn't the best. Clean, nice inside. The lady taking my order got a little rude and frustrated when I couldn't  talk to her in Spanish and didn't even try to talk in English. I got rolled tacos and they were pretty good, my boyfriend got the supreme nachos with carne asada and they were not that good, the chips were really soggy and the meat didn't taste authentic"}
{"text":"The food is great....The service is horrible lately.  I miss the old staff. My order was so messed up today,  I just walked out and went across the street to Taco Bell. 

I have been there so much,  I earned a free meal,  I left it all at the counter,  based on the customer service.  I will get my free meal and never patronize them again."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning here and had no  bowel movement  control for an entire week I ate the huarache and it tasted really good but there was some cross contamination.  I'm  just glad my pregnant wife  didn't get her sick."}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be... Great selections and awesome salsa bar. Unfortunately the last couple times me and my family ate there the portions got smaller and felt that my Super Nachos weren't very supper. Very skimpy on meat and beans for the amount of chips."}
{"text":"You can't beat the price.


You will want to eat  three or four of these street tacos to satisfy your craving, and at La Salsita there's never a  financial impediment in order to satisfy you hunger because these prices are very reasonable.

The carne asada, al pastor, and green chili beef  are top-notch. The tacos at La Salsita are served with a generous amount of  grilled meat piled on top of  delicious  housemade tortillas and topped off with cilantro and onions.

In addition to great tacos, La Salsita has some of the best chips and salsa around.  The chips are made to order and served piping hot.  The chips are hot, light, and crispy, there are a  meal in itself.

If your in the area and craving tacos you should stop by.  You won't be disappointed . Great food, reasonable prices, and friendly staff.  It doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"I came to this location for convenience, I was very disappointed. I ordered a torta de milanesa de res and was definitely not the same as other salsitas locations I only got one little piece of meat when at other locations you get like 3 or 4 layers of meat. Not worth the price at all and this location has bad service as well."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight on a whim. Food was excellent. Cashier wasn't very customer friendly or patient. May return, but hopefully cashier will be friendlier."}
{"text":"So sad.  man my mom went here today to get tacos and she seen 3 house cockroaches. OMG. I'm upset cause I loved their food but I can't do cockroaches at all."}
{"text":"Came in on saturday night looking for late night snack after DODGERS game food was good had the carnitas plate w beans and rice horchata was awesome too good service ! Have lots of stuff on menu .."}
{"text":"been here well over 50 times since i live down the street, but i got white guy charged last time i think lol. my burrito was 60 cents over the menu and a credit card fee of 49 cents. and the lady sat there a swept the floor for 5mins at least while i stood there. probably will not go back n i liked there carne asada. have fun with my extra buck guys!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Im not an expert on mexican food but this is for sure my favorite so far! The food is always fresh and everyone is very friendly. I could eat there everyday!"}
{"text":"Like this place for a late night snack. Specially those buzzed nights. All meat burritos are delish, greesy but delish, again only on buzzed nights!"}
{"text":"Never.again. 
Stopped on my way home from work. Ordered a bean and cheese burrito. Can't mess that up, right? 
WRONG!
First- the wrapper was dripping with grease from the fake cheese. 
Second- tortilla was dry, flaky and inedible. 
Third- beans- flavorless. 

I took two bites and tossed it in the trash. 


The chile was decent but that's about it."}
{"text":"Honestly we loved coming here the food was great but the custom service is horrible! They messed up our order and said we were in the wrong when we go there almost once a week and order the same thing and the lady with blonde hair kept on saying we were wrong and refusing to give us what we ordered for about 10 minutes then she finally put the order in ... ridiculous! Sad how good this place is but we won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite mexican food places in Avondale. And trust me, I am hard to please. I always get their tacos and my bf gets their burritos and I am always satisfied. I've only tried their asada, pastor and chicken, and I loved it. Their horchata os also yummy! I always like asking for their grilled onions and hot peppers, they add extra flavor to my meal. This is definitely my go to place when I am hungry and do not want to wait forever for my food. And before I forget, their salsas are authentic."}
{"text":"Food was amazing but when I had to go to the restroom the restrooms was full of trash. Even though  the restroom was nice the trash made it worse. Please have someone keep checking on the restrooms"}
{"text":"After a long drive from California, my sister and I wanted to indulge in some tasty Mexican food. It was Easter Sunday, so we made sure to call prior to coming in. This was the only place that answered their phone and confirmed that they were open, so we decided to give it a try. 

The location was in a pretty deserted and \"shady\" area, in my opinion, so it was a little intimidating/scary as we parked and walked in. There was no one there, but it looked like the food was fresh and hot. I tried the al pastor taco with carne asada fries. It was honestly nothing spectacular, and I think Mexican spots in SoCal are much better! I did like the sauce bar though."}
{"text":"Good food, poor (attitude), but speedy customer service. Try it, but don't expect the help to be too friendly.

Update, Oct. 2015

Service is still piss poor. They don't seem to care."}
{"text":"Had carne asada tacos meat is cheap no flavor at all,asked for chile's asados I got what looked like a smashed boiled 
jalapeno will not come back here again."}
{"text":"Food was ok tasting once we actually got it, it took about 40 minutes to get our food not a good place to go if your starving lol but after all the waiting and diving into my food from sitting for 40 minutes there was a hair in my freaking food  all nice and whipped in the sour cream that was in my tacos I was done with my mean and so was my whole family they gave me a whole $2.20 back and not even an apology. Never again!"}
{"text":"The tacos with pastor are awesome. They seasoning on all of their meat is tasty especially with some horchata to wash it down. Customer service is great, family owned. Everything is reasonably priced. Love to go here as a late night snack. Much better option compared to Jack in the Box or McDonald's."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new Mexican place and the reviews here were good so we gave it a go. When we pulled up it did not look like the most inviting place. There were no cars in the parking lot. Is it open? It was. When we walked in, all of the booths along one side had been pulled out and a young lady was cleaning the wall. The floor didn't appear to be in the best shape either... Mexican music was playing and it was a little loud.
We walked over toward the food and saw some really good looking meats behind the window counter. It was tough deciding what to get! The girl who was cleaning the wall came over to ring up our order. She did not seem happy to be there and wasn't very friendly. My boyfriend ordered carne asada fries for us to share and I got the 3 rolled tacos combo (beef only, I could not mix & match with chicken) w/ rice & beans. They don't have regular iced tea here so I got Pepsi. The drinks were filled up so much that when I put my straw in, the soda started overflowing onto the table. My boyfriend got up and asked for napkins. We used those but the soda continued to spill over so a man came over and wiped it with a rag. What a debacle.
It occurred to me that they might put guacamole on my taquitos. My boyfriend saw them putting guac and pico on the fries. Oh no! I didn't even think about that! In my mind it's just meat and cheese (and maybe sour cream). So he went back up and asked them not to put anything on my taquitos. They proceeded to ignore this request and had to remake them. Ugh.
When we got the carne asada fries, we very meticulously scooped off the pico chunks, but there's no way to erase the liquid guacamole, so I had to eat around it. Aside from that, the fries were pretty good. But I was reminded why taquitos aren't that amazing. They were mostly corn tortilla with very little meat inside. We asked for a side of sour cream. It cost $0.65, even though it probably would've come on my plate in the first place. Whatever. The rice and beans were pretty decent.
As we were finishing our meal, a COCKROACH ran across the floor and under our table. My boyfriend squashed it and I suddenly lost my appetite. For me, a cucaracha is a deal breaker. We will definitely NOT be eating here again."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos are to die for. Very friendly. A must stop for real authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food is good, open 24 hours and very convenient when craving for decent Mexican food."}
{"text":"Took our good to go so I can't comment on the taste yet, but the food smells amazing.  The service was fast. And tho the line was very long out wait was not."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good taco place in Avondale for a while now. We have finally found it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a sub par chain Mexican food restaurant with chips and salsa this is not the place to go. If you want some authentic awesome Mexican food then this is your place. I had the rolled tacos plate and a gordita. Everything was amazing. Service was great and the salsa bar was super clean and had lots of salsa options. Good sized portions and friendly staff. This is for sure on my list of go to places."}
{"text":"I, or friends, have not had anything from this place I didn't like.

Good food at good prices with great service to boot.
The condiments are delicious and universal to any dish on the menu.
The location is pretty lame, to be honest.
Though, the location of restaurants with great food usually isn't that great."}
