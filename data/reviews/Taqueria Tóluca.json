{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant what I usually get is menudo, tacos al carbon, fajitas, carne asada, coptel de camar√≥n or many other dishes for breakfast all of them are great please stop by and try anything that I mention above"}
{"text":"Awesome prices for the amount of food!!! Very authentic! Nothing Tex mex going on here!!! Servers were very polite, music was good, tables were clean! I would recommend it to anyone and the menus were in English as well!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't great, and our waitress wasn't the brightest bulb. My daughter wanted apple juice, but she didn't know if they even had it. When we asked about cheese dip, she had no clue what I was talking about. She had to go ask the manager if they served it.  My water was never filled, to the point that I had a completely empty glass. My husband had to add flavor to the guacamole. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Food was great. You get a lot of food for the price. The waitress was very nice. Only drawback is the neighborhood is a little scary."}
{"text":"I printed a voucher off of restaurant.com and when I tried to redeem it the server told me they don't accept them because they are fraud. 

I still ordered off of the lunch specials and had two chicken enchiladas. It was ok. Not much flavor in the chicken or the smothered sauce. Rice and beans were typical. Chips weren't warm and the two different salsas were just ok. One was more of a chunky salsa and one was a spicy salsa."}
{"text":"If you don't speak Spanish, it is not a problem there will be someone to help you. Unless you look Spanish but aren't Spanish and don't speak Spanish. This is always a problem for me because I get treated a certain way for not speaking Spanish when they think I should based on my looks but I just gotta deal with it and get over it.

I haven't sat in and ate here, so I can't testify to the service of being waited on. First time I walked in and took my order to go and second time, I called ahead and placed my order to go. Calling ahead, saved me a little time but not a lot of time. I still had to wait a bit to get the food.

The food overall is okay. Not the best and not the worse. But for a quick Mexican lunch it does the trick. The refried beans here are actually okay and not so bland. Some of the food can be on the greasy side but it is what to be expected from a place like this.

I would come back if I wanted a quick Mexican lunch again just wouldn't be my first choice."}
