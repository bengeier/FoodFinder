{"text":"I just can't buy anything from this place. I know I'm in an airport and there is a premium to be paid but they have taken price gouging to new levels. Everything is about 20% more than the highest price I'd be willing to pay. $2.60 for a bag of chips, $2 for a small apple...I can't enjoy a purchase if I'm angry at the price. There are some products that are widely availible in other nearby places that are priced less. Just put a Timmy's kiosk there since they dont gouge and they have long lines (go figure!)"}
{"text":"Located on the domestic side.  Nothing really different from the others, as being a franchise, you get the expected.  Pre-made sandwiches, the lady in front of me couldn't even change her bread from white to brown.  Just got my chips and bottled water, if I'm going to be ripped off, at least not on a crappy sandwich lol.  Sell fruits too.  Amex good."}
{"text":"2$ oranges, hopefully they are good!!  What I like here is the salad bar (liking is a big word since it's average) but at least we can get a healthier option here. You can also buy sandwiches here and coffee. Good!? Very average!  Prices are definitely high. $$   No airport staff discount, big fail!"}
