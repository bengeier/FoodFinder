{"text":"You can't go wrong with pub food at a pub. We got the jake's platter and everything was great. Not over fried, perfect crisped, and better than expected. Service was decent and attentive, they helped recommend drinks for my wife which helped the experience. She had a Blue Hawaiian which was ok, not overly strong. Needed more alcohol. Overall I was happy and will definitely return for the great neighbourhood patio experience."}
{"text":"What I enjoy most about jakes is the out door patio. It's an awesome place to chill with friends, have a beer and enjoy the food. The food isn't amazing but it's good. And the waiters are friendly"}
{"text":"Went there with friend just before midnight. Location is great, service could be much better. Food quality - ehhh nothing special ( in my opinion mid to low end). Patio is good for summer and cold beer, do not expect more than that."}
{"text":"Jakes is definately the hotspot on main street. Great bar, and the food isn't bad either. I only wish the beer was cheaper, but who doesn't. If I had to suggest something to eat here, I would recommend the Jakes chicken burger with sweet potato fried, or the fully loaded nachos, or the spicy bbq chicken pizza. Very friendly service as well."}
{"text":"me and wife both hated the lobster grilled cheese sandwich. the fries were good and the wings were alright. the pasta was my wifes fav the restaurant looks like an old house good service good location poor vibe inside"}
{"text":"Probably the worst service and worst food I've ever had at a restaurant. Food is overpriced and the looks like it was made by a 10 year old monkey that they keep in the kitchen. Service is horrible."}
{"text":"Unfortunately,  I don't even think this place deserves a 1 star.  I've been here quite a few times over the years and honestly this place has gone down with every visit.  The service just gets worse every time I come and I think I've given this place more than enough chances to change my mind.  It's sad though because honestly they had an advantage over all the other places due to their big patio area which would be the ideal summer hang out.  However, poor customer service always kills the mood.  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place with a large patio and lots of shade on Mainstreet Unionville, this is definitely the place to go!  My friends and I were here on Saturday night, the place was busy but we were able to get a seat very quickly. There were lots of options of the menu and they also had specials which were at a reasonable price point. Just a note, the specials aren't listed on the menu, so you either need to ask your server or look at the special board in front of the patio entrance. There were also an array of drink options available and some cocktails especially were very unique. For beer fans like myself, there are lots of beers on tap to choose from and they are not watered down.  I order the Mediterranean Quiche and it comes with a side option (I got Caesar salad) for $9.99. The dish was great and loaded with ingredients. The only little complaint is that the Quiche could have been baked a little longer for that crispier texture. My friends ordered a thin crust pizza and chicken wrap also with a side of Caesar salad. The pizza I would say is a must try. For those looking for finger food options, I would say the nachos are a must have. I noticed many tables ordering it and boy was the plate of nacho massive!   Definitely, will be back here again to try out the nachos and other cocktails and beer on tap."}
{"text":"I with my friend come to this restaurant on labour day. After we sat down and placed our order, we want to change to another empty table. Supprisingly, I was told the tables are divided into different sections and not allowed to do so. What!!, This is your problem, not mine, I just want a table I like. The whole mood is spoiled by this particular server, and I will not come back again. The food and price are ok, definitely not worth for 3 yelp stars, as food, price, environment and service come in a package to rate a restaurant."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out on a nice stroll down unionville. I cant say I was overly happy. It was ok. Not the best. I guess what makes it ok is the nice patio and sipping on a nice cocktail on nice spring day. The food was pretty blah. We ordered nachos and they were cold. The waitress was to busy and forget to bring us a new set when we told her they were cold. Their menu wasn't something to rave about chicken wings. fingers , hamburgers, nachos etc.. Usual pub fare. I was thinking something a little more unique considering the area. However lots of young people on the patio in early 20's getting drunk acting dumb.  I give it a 3 because maybe they were understaffed that day and I am trying to be fair.  Other than unionville is beautiful I dont know if I will give this place a second try.  Their should be another more upscale atmosphere on unionville for the older crowd."}
{"text":"Went to Jakes for a quick dinner as we were hungry and wanted to enjoy the patio. Ordered the Steak Frites and requested the steak to be medium rare. The steak came out well done. I was hungry and was willing to eat it. When the waitress came by to ask how the food was, I told her that my steak was overcooked but that I'm fine with keeping the meal. She offered to ask the manager for a discount on the meal. Well when the bill came, the waitress was quite embarrassed to have to tell me that all the manager would say was \"sorry...\"  I completely understand busy long weekends and dinner rushes but I do not understand the lack of customer service. I was not expecting my meal to be comped but the fact that the waitress felt it was worth a discount and the manager refused...that's just poor management.  All in all, other than the overcooked steak, the rest of the food was ok. A little pricey but is comparable to the other restaurants on Unionville Main."}
{"text":"the food was ok and the patio is nice but the service was slow :-("}
{"text":"I gave Jake's one star because that was the lowest rating. I have been living in Markham for over 15 years and I have to warn you to stay away from this place.  Jake's is famous for it's horrible and overpriced 'food' (if you want to call it that), and the service SUCKS! All of the waitresses/servers are ignorant and in need of a major attitude adjustment, and they will also STEAL YOUR MONEY  For Example: Let us say that your bill comes up to a hypothetical $15.00 and you decide to pay with a $20 bill. The waitress will take your money and inform you that he/she will be back with your change. However, he/she will NEVER come back. Instead, if you decide to confront the person, they will tell you something along the lines of, \"I thought you said I could keep it\". And if/when you actually get your change back (which should be $5), you will only get back $2-$3...   (Jake's, will it kill you to hire staff that is capable of smiling, not stealing/messing up your order, and treating the customer with maybe an ounce of respect/common courtesy? It's a two way stream, am I right?)  Oh, . Lastly, and I hate to say this or even think of pulling this card, but if you are an educated/polite/well dressed visible minority, do not be surprised if you receive some pretty OVERT and in your face racism... and that last bit was realized after a non-visible minority colleague who I was with pointed it out.  Overall, I have to say that Jake's is situated in a great place (Historic Main Street Unionville, and the patio, although big, is not necessarily better). However, this establishment is in dire need of new management, knowledgeable staff, and an ideology centered on mutual respect and customer service. I sincerely hope that one day things will change for this establishment but until then, I will not be returning nor recommending Jake's to anyone- including you.  As a customer we all deserve better.   Cheers."}
{"text":"I eat here about four or five times a year during the Toronto Bicycling Network's cycling season. It's one our favourites. We get great service, usually starting at the end of March. We've been lucky the past few years that the early spring weather was warm enough for the patio to be open. For a large group of about 20 people, the service was consistently attentive and the food was very good. We keep coming back. So I give it four stars because if we didn't like it, or had lots of complaints, we would go somewhere else. Keep in mind, I only ever eat here on Sunday afternoons, or holiday Monday afternoons, so I have no idea what this place is like in the evening."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Will never eat here again. Had to prove to a very rude and snotty waitress that our daughter was 12 after giving us dirty looks and questioning our daughter's age. The food quality was as if it was ordered somewhere in Cuban resort. The plate that our food was served on was dirty with leftovers from the previous serving. Very bland food and cold fries probably done few hours before our arrival. Penne pasta served without souce and with bread served with traces of salad dressing from  previous customer. We had to wait 50 minutes. Very dissapointing experience.  Would not recomend this place and please be ready to show credentials if having children up to 12 years of age.  High price for very low quality."}
{"text":"This is pretty much my go-to bar in the Markham area. All of my friends who I've taken here have loved it.  The patio is really nice in the summer and it's usually pretty busy outside if the weather is nice. They have free popcorn inside that I always get and the poutine is absolutely amazing. Definitely one of the best poutines I've ever had. The service is friendly but not always the fastest because it can get very busy."}
{"text":"Who doesn't want to love this place? Great big patio on Main St Unionville sounds like an ideal way to spend a summer afternoon. No matter how perfect their location may be, their lack of service will definitely keep me far away from this place. The food is very mediocre, regular pub food, nothing more nothing less. The servers are impossible to get a hold of. Last time I was there, I waited for over 30 mins for my bill, and in the end, I had to go find her inside the restaurant and asked to pay on the spot by the cashier.  They only get business because of the location... I've stopped coming here for years and you are much better off to go across the street to Arms Pub's patio."}
{"text":"Burger quality is so bad, poor and cheap. Mcdonnald $1 burger tastes better than $16 burger here. Food quality is very poor compared to price and location."}
{"text":"Despite the horrible Yelp reviews, I came here for the first time on my friend's birthday. The 12 of us were seated upstairs by the pool table, and it took awhile before our waitress showed up.   I wouldn't say that the service was too horrible. Our waitress was actually pretty friendly, however, the service was SO SLOW. There was at least a 15-minute gap from when she took our drink order to when she came back with the drinks to take our food order. When we ordered the food (around 8PM), we didn't see the waitress till 9PM. By the time everyone got their order, it was around 9:30PM..   The food was A-OK, surprisingly. The portions are enormous! 1. Steak & Mushroom Poutine - We asked for the steak to be done rare, and it came closer to medium rare. The chunks were tough to chew on, but overall not bad.  2. Fish & Chips - The fish was a bit dry with tons of batter! The fries were super crispy and piping hot!  3. Chicken Caesar Wrap - In the words of my boyfriend - \"Too much lettuce, too little chicken and sauce\"   The kitchen may be understaffed, but the food was still decent. Prices weren't too pricey either, comparable to any other pubs/bars. Service wasn't awful, just extremely slow.   I'll have to come back to test their consistency, and enjoy that nice patio when the weather gets warmer!"}
{"text":"Overall a mediocre experience at best.   First off, the interior itself is already a turnoff. Seems old, dirty and the menus are sticky and unflattering. This place really needs a revamp in order to get with the times. We were a party of nineteen but only one server was available for us. It was a decent time but i just feel bad for having only one girl deal with all of our shenanigans.   Now for the food, the prices are sky high and super inflated, especially for the quality of the meal you receive. However, I can say that some of their dishes are actually pretty tasty! The sweet potato fries were on par and the fish and beef tacos as a whole were pretty tasty. However, I would stay away from ordering from the salads... nothing special and insane price. Alfredo was bland and oily.   Was celebrating a birthday and they give free cheesecake so that was delicious :)"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended Jake's so I decided to give it a shot. It has a very nice patio space that would make this restaurant ideal during the warmer seasons. Inside was on the noisier side, which makes it a bit difficult to talk if you're a larger group.   I ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich with a side of fries. While I wasn't ecstatic over my food, I also wasn't disappointed. The servings were fairly large but the taste was only mediocre. Although my sandwich was good, it felt very ordinary and \"store bought\". I expected something it to taste more unique/special for the price I was paying. The food was also too salty for my taste. Overall, the sandwich wasn't worth $14 - I've had better for cheaper.   My friend had the Lobster Clam Fettuccine ($19) and this was really good. It had a very creamy, rich flavour without being overbearing. I highly recommend this dish - although it's one of the pricier menu items, it's probably one of the only items that are worth the price.   Customer service was decent but nothing special - our server was friendly and performed all the basic roles but didn't go beyond expectations.   Overall, I would recommend Jake's for the location and the patio seats, but not for the food. The food is mediocre at most and definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"I was at Jakes this past weekend.  Great weather compelled me to go to Jakes because they have a great patio.   Ambiance was incredible, but the food was a huge disappointment.   I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with lobster and crab.  The bread had a nice dark color which led me to believe that the cheese would be melted.  Unfortunately the cheese was not properly melted and the lobster and crab centre was cold.  The side of poutine was not any better.   Gravy lacked flavor and they topped it with shredded cheddar vs cheese curds.  My wife had the chicken fajitas and the chicken looked and tasted like it was precooked chicken taken out of a cryovac bag.    The only way I would go back to this place is to have a beer and nachos on the patio.  The arms pub is a much better option."}
{"text":"Horrible wings. They were dry and tasted peppery with zero flavour. One positive is the patio. Only return if I'm just getting drinks."}
{"text":"I usually avoid Jake's in the summertime because having gone to highschool in Unionville, you will most likely run into someone you once knew and awkward small talk about what you're doing with your life ensues.  Aside from that, it's very spacey, great for groups, the bartenders and servers are pleasant and the food is pretty typical pub food, nothing amazing but usually it's enough to soak up the beer. The upstairs is fun for a small party if you're into pool."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend couple of weeks ago. I love there patio .. Great location.. Close to a nice park ...  Food.. I like it there. We had French fries with chill and fajitas. It was very good. Very fresh.   It's a busy place especially on the weekend but its a nice place o sit on a nice summer day and enjoy yourself..."}
{"text":"The patio is a great place to enjoy a drink.  Skip the overpriced, mediocre food."}
{"text":"Probably the best patio on Unionville Main St from 11 AM until maybe 12:15 PM. But after that I would prefer to sit across the st at the Arms because I like sitting in the sun and the Arms is the best for receiving the afternoon sun. Jakes however has much bigger patio and very prompt service and they even have tons of attractive and very expensive heaters outside if the weather is not quite warm enough. Plus it's where all our friends go,and they always have great free national Trivia network for those people who like playing trivia like me."}
{"text":"Service is very average, beer not cold enough. Menu was covered in grease and part of a pickle dried on it. Food was okay - about what I expected. Huge patio and probably a great place to go with friends on weekends but if you want to dine somewhere there are way better choices in Unionville."}
{"text":"Came here with my parents a few Fridays ago. Our server Mel was amazing ! So friendly,personable and helpful. Our food came out fast and hot,and we were all happy with our meals. I hadn't been here in a few years. The last time I was I remember the food was pretty bad, hense why I never went back. My parents had been for new years and they were quiet impressed with the menu.  I was a little hesitant to go back after my prior exprience but glad I gave it another shot!"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews of all you fab-tastic Yelpers, I decided to take some friends to Jake's On Main recently to see what all the hype was about.   Going in I had managed my expectations knowing both that the pro's I was aware of were that Jake's had great food, a fantastic patio (best in Unionville) and that it was the place to be for a summer night party. On the other hand the cons were that the food was a miss, the prices were high and the service was poor. With a split decision like this looming I felt I needed to venture in and see for myself.  Overall my experience was pretty good, I have to admit. My friends and I enjoyed our drinks (how can you not enjoy beer on a patio in the summer) and we all agreed that for a Tuesday night the large patio was a frenzy of activity. Congrats Yelp, your reviews were on par.  This being said, and I hope that someone from Jake's reads this as constructive criticism and not as me slamming them, but there are some core issues that contributed to less than stellar star rating.  1) Yelpers get another point for being ON POINT about pricing. A wee bit extreme for the GTA, this is isn't down town on college street - its the historic village of Unionville Main street. Most notable faux pas was $25+ for a pitcher of Sangria, especially when I knew the wine they are using and it retails for around $7/bottle. I've never paid more than $18. (-1 star)  2) Yelp! This food isn't so good. We placed an order for something simple that we could all share and something that is impossible to mess up - Nachos. Not a fan. I wanted to be, I really did, but there was way too much chilli con carne and salsa on these CHOS, to make me want to CHOOSE to eat them again. Yes the portion size is astronomical, but I think quality is far better than quantity here folks. Within minutes the chips were mushy and the cheese was hard. (-1 star).  3) Yelp, for 3...SWISH. Look I understand a bumping patio can get busy and but still no excuse for not doing quality checks on food (would have sent it back) and making us wait forever and a day for drinks and the bill. Maybe Tuesday night got unexpectedly busy and they were understaffed, but perhaps this is a Needs Improvement area. I wasn't awful, but not great (-0.5 stars).  I give Jake's On Main 2.5 overall, but 3 officially. I will be back because we did have fun, and heck I'm all about 2nd and 3rd chances. Good job on all you Yelpy Yelpertons, way to stay true. Stay tuned for my updated review in the weeks to come. I'm rooting for Jake's."}
{"text":"you need to clean your ice machine. every drink with ice had dirt in it. SO GROSS"}
{"text":"We came to Jake's tonight for the Yelp drink special. As others have noted, the prices here are a bit high. I enjoyed the BBQ chicken pizza, but I'm not sure it's worth $15!   I've been here previously in the summer, and the patio is indeed nice.   Overall, this is a decent spot with a nice atmosphere and decent service (except on the patio in the summer), but expect to overpay.  In the area, I prefer the Unionville Arms and in terms of patios in Markham, I prefer the Duchess of Markham."}
{"text":"Awesome patio. Beautiful friendly servers. Great food great prices and amazing beer and food specials"}
{"text":"Wanted to go to Jake's, tonight. Couldn't because the place isn't wheelchair accessible! Was given an excuse that the building was a heritage site. Sorry, but not acceptable!"}
{"text":"I don't usually vote a restaurant two stars and to be completely honest the place might have been five stars to someone else but for me I just wasn't feeling the vibe. My food was mediocre, I didn't think it tasted bad but it was nothing special. I wouldn't have come back for it. I got the spinach and beet salad, and no it's not because I ordered a salad that I didn't enjoy. I quite frequently order salads and thoroughly enjoy them. I do want to point out that it's possible I didn't enjoy my food as much because we were seated outside by the fence on the patio far away from any heaters. I have a 10 week old puppy that I'm unable to leave at home for long periods of time and it was a beautiful day to venture around main street Unionville however as dinner time approached and my company grew hungry I was told we had to leave my puppy on the other side of the fence (of the fully outdoor patio). I am familiar with the restaurant industry and I have respect for the rules and regulations of an establishment however under the circumstances I thought it was excessive they make me leave my puppy alone on the other side of the fence. The hostess seemed unapologetic and uncaring of the fact that I was uncomfortable with the situation. It was very cold (even for us) and so you can imagine the puppy with no coat sitting still not getting movement to keep him warm. Another thing was that because our table was  by the fence (far off to the outskirts of the patio) me and my company were even cold. The patio had heaters but none of them were close to the edge they were all positioned relatively close to each other in the middle by majority of the guests. We asked if they could be moved but the staff simply said no. I felt that if you insist people sit their dogs on the other side of the fence and that they sit along the edge of the patio you should accommodate heaters close by. Now I know this post sounds very complainy and I'm not one to typically complain but I honestly did not have a good time I was very uncomfortable. The only good part of the experience was out WONDERFUL sever Melissa!!!! She was fabulous. Very sweet girl, me and my guest both made sure to let her know she went above and beyond to serve us well."}
{"text":"went on st patties day great atomsphere and spirit. food is bang for buck. service is decent. and is almost always busy there"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening to enjoy their large patio.  Our party of 4 put our name down on the wait list at about 6:45pm and waited about 30 minutes before we got our table.  I noticed their dining room was actually empty but we were never asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside, so for those of you that don't care for the patio, inquire about sitting inside!  Our server was great! She was very outgoing and talkative.  Her timing was good and she was also able to give recommendations when we asked about the menu!  Food was OKAY.  Our party ordered wings, a burger, fajitas, fish tacos and a side of fries.  The fajitas tasted good but when it came out, the pan wasn't sizzling!  The burger was a good size and had good flavours.  The fries were not fresh cut, but tasted decent!  They had a couple of beer specials on a SATURDAY night, which was great.  They had PBR and Red Racer Tallboys for $3.99.  To end, great service, average food."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Friday and it was pretty empty. Expect typical bar food, with large portions but not the best dining experience.  We ordered the Reuben sandwich and calamari.  Reuben sandwich with Caesar salad- I really appreciated that the kitchen was able to split the order so that I could share with my brother. Caesar salad was decent. But I was not a fan of the sandwich. Tasted bland and old. Really had to douse it with the mustard on the side in order to get any flavor  Calamari- seemed like the calamari was in the freezer for a while before they deep fried it. Also had some fries, which weren't too bad  Overall, I don't see myself coming back to this place unless I came to watch a game. Food was bland and unpleasant. But if you're looking for value, I guess you get decent value because of the portions they serve."}
{"text":"Giving it 4 stars because it's an excellent location with patio seating (great for the summertime!) and our server was very nice and organized. We came with a big group (about 12 people) and they were able to do separate bills, with no default tip included. I had the pulled pork sandwich with ceasar salad. The sandwich was good, but the lettuce from the salad was kind of limp so it probably wasn't very fresh. Other than that, we had a great time!"}
{"text":"I travel for work, so I tend to like restaurants that make me feel at home.  Jake's On Main in Markham, ON is one of those places.  I like to sit at the bar...so I did.  The bartender Jeannie was a pleasure and gave me great service.  There is a nice selection of draft beer and the food is good (not \"blow me away\" good, but certainly good for a casual bar type environment).  I will go back the next time I am in Markham - which I hope is soon!"}
{"text":"Just your regular bar when you want to go see a fight or a game. The crowd is definitely lively during games and mildly quiet during regular days. Unionville Main Street is quite the scene, so I was expecting a bit more from Jake's. I went during a game night.. It was jam packed! Love the crowd here, but the food and price did not do justice.. Just because it's Main Street doesn't mean pricing has to be set higher than other bars that makes the same or better tasting food."}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled chicken breast which came with rice, Greek salad and garlic bread and it was simply delicious. The chicken was cooked on point, still juicy, and had that delicious charcoal taste. Not a big rice fan, I had one bite, it wasn't bad. We also ordered a steak and blue sandwich with a poutine, I have that a bite and it was cooked the way we asked, medium well. So it's approved for food!   Ordered a Somersby on tap and it tasted like apple juice, that wasn't a good sign. I did end up changing it to bottled stuff.   I really like their patio with the cute Christmas lights, although it's summer right now.   I just wanted to add more pictures of the food, didn't seem to have much on here.   Really, try the food. It's pretty good!"}
{"text":"This is one of the lowest ratings I've ever given and I would definitely never come back. I gave this place one star because the food was still edible, but the service was mehhh and it made me sick enough to not feel like eating dessert (which almost NEVER happens).   I ordered the fish taco, with a side of caesar salad. The caesar salad was the best thing on the plate. The fish tacos, on the other hand, needed a lot of improvement. There was a strange-tasting bright orange sauce that covered everything in the taco, which made it very hard to avoid while eating. The sauce also soaked into the soft taco and the lettuce. The best word to describe this taco: soggy.  My friend got the All-Star burger and a strawberry daquiri. She took one sip of it and regretted ordering the $6.99 drink. Her burger looked really sad and after she ate it, she was sad too. Her drink also slowly separated into two distinct layers, which may have been exactly what was happening in her stomach.  I do not recommend this place because it is overpriced and it makes you physically incapable of eating dessert :("}
{"text":"This place has hit a new low ! For all my 13 years living in Unionville and occasionally eating at this place they have never been particularly famous for their cuisine or (especially) for their service (after many changes of ownership), but last time they have dropped their bar even lower. First I had to wait endlessly observing how inefficient and unprofessional their staff is, chaotically moving around cleaning tables, serving customers and seating new patrons .. it looked so ill organized.. I think that chaos alone increases the line wait time by 30-40%. The worst was yet to come though. Once seated we were left without attention for 15 minutes - again, helplessly observing many servers chaotically running around but no one paying attention to our table.  Only after directly confronting the server at the door somebody showed up to take the order.  That being said . They have the nice patio, that's their only saving grace and what makes me come to this place in summer .  It's just a shame that such a nice patio belongs to a place with such a lousy service."}
{"text":"Jake's can be a really great place to hang out. I say \"can\", because sometimes it just misses the mark. For example, I came here on a Saturday for some dinner outdoors and enjoyed a couple beers with my friends. I had a fantastic time. The week before that, I came here on Friday night to hang around the bar and again, enjoy a few beers with friends. This time, it was not so fantastic.   First, let's talk about the good. They've got a wonderful outdoor space that's large and comfortable. They've got a great drink and food selection with some hearty pub favourites like meat pies and burgers. The servers were extremely friendly and even though they were very busy, we didn't have a huge problem getting their attention.   But what happened the Friday before?? My friends and I got here at around 10 pm. It was pretty empty for a Friday night, but it was also chilly outside so it was understandable. All we wanted was a place to talk, chill, and drink so we took seats by the bar. For some reason, there were kids running up and down the stairs. Not Jake's problem at all, it just got me thinking about how it was past their bedtime.   It was nice for the first 30 minutes or so. Then suddenly, they decided they needed to pump the place up or something. Not that it was the crowd to do it with; there were maybe 10 people on the ground floor, and probably families up on the second floor since there were kids. The DJ started blasting some clubbing music about 2 feet away from us. So here we were in a nearly empty establishment, unable to hear each other talk, beats blasting into our ears, with kids knocking over popcorn from the popcorn machine. At some point, we even heard one of the waitresses telling the DJ to turn it down.   Was this a bar? Was this a family restaurant? Was this a club? I left very confused with my ears ringing that night.  (47/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"My friend and I ate outside on a perfect sunny day. The outside patio was perfect to grab a drink and spend time with others. The price was relatively affordable. The price ranges from 10-20$. I got the smoked salmon club, perfect for brunch. The portions was large enough to be full. My other friend got the butter chicken, don't recommend. Overall, the place is suitable for a couple drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"There was a wait outside due to the sunny day and everyone wanting to eat, went up to the staff me ever and asked how long for the wait for a table, was told 20mins   30 mins later I saw several people being seated before us who just wandered up, just brushed it off as they had booked or a table for their party size was available, watched again for 10 more mins and finally I went to ask why .... Was told they were wanting seats inside .... Erm so .... I've been waiting on a seat for 40 mins   Oh I assumed you wanted outside  Don't assume ..... Explain that the waits for outside but there are tables inside .... Let me decide   Wasted 40 mins of my life   Then inside service was slow and the meal was bland and nothing special   Lucky to get the 2 stars"}
{"text":"If you're from Markham, you might have went to Jakes or came across this place sometime in your lifetime. The summer patio is really nice, especially during the Jazz festival. There's a live band that plays right there and it's an awesome time to drink a beer while sitting outdoors.  In the winter, there's not a lot of people who come, but it's a homey place for people to grab a drink, eat some pub food. Despite the wonderful space they offer, I'm not a big fan of the food at all here. I tried their honey garlic wings. These were a little dry (the wings themselves), the fries were also mediocre in my opinion. For a lb of wings, it's $14. I rather pay for St. Louis wings. They're sweet potato fries are alright, $8 and served with Chipotle.   If it was for the food alone, I would probably rate this place 1.5 - 2 stars, but their environment (especially during the summers) are quite nice."}
{"text":"Officially my new favourite summer patio! Came here on a Saturday afternoon and had a great time. They serve typical pub food but I loved the ambiance of the outdoor patio. I ordered the beet and quinoa salad and it was absolutely delicious. Portion sizes are fairly large but I was able to finish my meal (it was very light).  Prices were fair and service was pretty good as well.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"On a chilly fall day, I passed by for drinks with my buddy. There was only one table with people on the patio. We opted to sit inside the bar and order a few drinks with some snacks. They actually had some beer specials and gave away glassware with every order.  My friend order the big Octoberfest pint and convinced me to follow before my dinner plans. It was 36 oz of glory and the glass was pretty heavy.  It's a great place to have a drink and the glass giveaway was a bonus. There is also a Stella beer and glass special. I may stop by for that souvenir.  Service overall was great."}
{"text":"The ambience of the place deserves a solid 5 star rating, as long as the place is not overcrowded.   The attitude of the staff is friendly and helpful, so combined with the above, this sounds like a winning combination, right?  Unfortunately the food is really mediocre and the so called kids menu dishes are not kids friendly - some are spicy, some are overcooked.   To summarize, this place is great for having a beer on the patio, and maybe a bite of pub fare to eat. If you are not into pub fare, don't bother with the food.  If you happen to be there with children, avoid altogether."}
{"text":"I've been here before and the food is amazing but the service... Not so good. My waiter came her once to check on us and that it. Never again. I've being trying to hunt my waiter down for over 20 mins and when she finally notices is she still at a different table.   The atmosphere was great but not when u wanna go after u finish your meal and had enough of the music. It's no the point where I had a drink felt great and because of all the wait the feeling has left and left me with impatience for my bill.   Maybe it's better for takeout then sit in."}
{"text":"So.... who HASN'T been to jake's? I remember turning 19 and hanging out here almost everyday in the summer (WOW, DID I GET POOR). With that said, the pricing is high, even for a main street. I guess they make it work though, because boy do they get a lot of customers.   The patio is the main treat in the summer time. Being a passerby, you are always envious when you see groups of friends drinking on the patio, swaying to the music and generally having a great time. However, as you approach, you get stopped bluntly by 'security' that think they're downtown bouncers. The power trip is unreal. The power trip is so unreal to the point where you think you'd have to pay customs to get in.   The inside is like a giant house party, to be honest. Different rooms, upstairs, downstairs. It's LIT. The crowd is mixed, young teens with fakes to older groups of what could be hells angel's gang members. I don't remember the food being insanely amazing but I don't recall it being barf-worthy, ONLY hella $$$$.   Service depends.. it seems like they can't handle it when it gets busy because servers get overwhelmed and either visit your table 20 times in two minutes or none at all in two hours. I don't even know.  Jake's, please step it up. With pretty much the BEST spot on main street Unionville and a sunny summer coming up .. please."}
{"text":"I went to Jake's about two weekends ago with some friends to grab a couple of drinks and catch the NBA All Star Weekend.  Coming into the restaurant, I expected to have about average pub food, a good selection of beers and other alcohol options, and some TVs that would show the game.  Jake's on Main met all those expectations.  For my meal, I ordered a burger with mushrooms and cheese and some French fries. I also had a couple of pints of Stella Artois and our group ordered finger food appetizers ( I remember passing around the nachos).  The burger and fries were about what I expected (to be fair, it is pretty hard to over- or under- achieve on a burger or fries).  I enjoyed my meal and liked to spot we were seated which gave us a good view of a couple of TVs and we could watch all star events.  The verdict: Good food. Good atmosphere. Good service. Met all of my expectations and did not WOW me in any area.  3.0/5.0"}
{"text":"We got here at 620. Been sitting here for 25 minutes,  our server never introduced herself. Asked the waitress to get our server and we are still waiting. Literally 5 servers are standing around talking to each other.  Had the \"spicy\"  chicken breast with seafood.  Chicken was way overcooked.  It was honestly rubber,  it made it salvageable because of the red sauce.  Overall,  pretty bad service,  food was alright,   Did I mention my utensils were dirty?  Had to ask for another set."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday dinner. Situated in the heart of Main St. Unionville and probably the best pub/patio there.  The food was surprisingly better than I expected of pub food. Ordered the New York Steak that comes with Sauteed mushooms, garlic toast and a choice of a side ($18.99) and it was quite decent.   Service was quite slow, even when that patio wasn't packed. But at the same time, when you're enjoying the weather and a couple of drinks, it didn't bother at me.   It gets quite packed on most nights, so make reservations. Definitely my go-to bar place in Markham now."}
{"text":"The patio is amazing and it creates a good vibe.  Overall, it is a friendly atmosphere.  I don't find the drinks to be really good and the food is just okay.  Nothing great for pub food.  Overall it was an okay experience but I would go back for the overall vibe."}
{"text":"This place is considered a local landmark pub along beautiful Unionville Main St. Summertime! This is the place to be, whether it's for drinks, food, dinner or a date, Jake's has the ability to accomadate.   The service was efficient, our server was sweet,  knowledgeable and personable.  My buddy and I decided to order a pitcher of Creemore beer along with their popular jumbo size of nachos.  Usually Nachos tend to be my go-to thing when visiting a new pub/ restaurant.  They say that you can TELL A LOT about a Restaurant by the way they keep their restrooms clean, same goes for NACHOS.  The portion was gratifying, the amount of cheese, pickles, hot peppers, etc they put a lot of effort on both portion and presentation.    The place is overal good! with a decent patio space to accomodate a lot of people, and is a popular hangout for locals.  Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights the crowd tends to be a lot younger in their early 20's and its a lot more louder lol... overall great place to chill and enjoy Unionville Main St."}
{"text":"Jake's reminded me of a high school house party. The bar is actually inside a mansion and there is a massive patio out front. Didn't have a lot of food, split a poutine, but it was pretty good. The selection of beers on tap is alright (Keith's Mill St. Organic, Guinness) and they have a live DJ playing every weekend. It's generally a younger crowd like 19-mid-20s, and its a great place to have a few drinks."}
{"text":"Location is great, right in the midst of Main Street. Huge patio. Service is alright. Seems to only have 2 waitress working on a Saturday night. Food came pretty quickly. I had the pulled pork sandwich: pretty standard as well as the halibut melt sandwich. Poutine was great. Most likely to  come back for pulled pork poutine."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. If you are in a rush or hungry this isn't a place to be. It takes so long for the waitress to come serve you . The food is average and it could be missed. The plate a dirty and the seat are dirty. I would never give more then a 3 star for this restaurant."}
{"text":"I think the reason people like Jake's is due to the fact they probably have the biggest patio in the area. The food is never really all that great, and it is just like any other pub.  Dropped by here last Friday for lunch and my friend ordered the nachos which were clearly covered in pasta sauce. The menu claims it's chili but it wasn't chili.   Our server brought us our check without us asking for it.. and we weren't even done yet. Service was a little iffy."}
{"text":"For some reason, Jakes has been our go to place every time we've a last minute celebration to do. It's really not bad as its open late and doesn't seem to be busy every time we've gone. Lots of tables inside and outside (if weather is permitting).   If you're going to order chicken wings, they happen to taste like the Costco ones. Although they don't have Cajun flavour on the menu, you can ask for it.   Other then that, the service is not bad. The food does take a while to come but when you go with a group it's not a big deal as you just end up sitting and talking anyways."}
{"text":"The location of Jake's patio is unbeatable on sunny summer day. It's a perfect spot to drink a beer and people watch. You will occasionally spot a wedding party or a group playing Pokemon Go wandering around. In the summer, there is plenty of food traffic on the street, so it keeps the scenery interesting. There are plenty of tables outside, so it's easy to get a seat.  The food itself is not that impressive, typical pub food of ribs/wings/burger/fries. I had the steak and mushroom pub pie which was good and filling. The side of garden salad was simple, mixed greens with a couple chunks of tomatoes and cucumbers thrown on top. However, some of the greens were a little wilted and had to be sorted into a reject pile. The dressing was served on the side without me even asking, which I appreciated. In conclusion, great summer patio location with meh-level food."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great service. Asked the bartender to make me something fruity and she was right on !! Even took the time to have small talks with us even though she was super busy. We will be back! Thank you!"}
{"text":"First time here despite walking through Main St. Unionville fairly often. I'll start with the not-so-great and then end with the positives.   Cons: - Quite a long wait for a table without reservations, (45 mins - 1 hr) but it was a Friday. - Food was meh. Just meh. - Waitresses slightly in their own worlds.  - Bouncers/Security were kind of douchey.   Pros: - The best outdoor patio in Unionville (porch seating is fab. Con, no smoking). - Sangrias were delicious.  - Lively crowd come 11PM.   Overall it's a great place for drinks if you can get a seat outside. Most people weren't interested in porch seating but if you're not a smoker, go for it! Best view overlooking the rest of the patio + you're outside.   I'll definitely be back. 4 stars purely for the location itself."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5 Service: 2/5 Location: 5/5  Highlights: It's all about the ambiance. Perfect place to go on a warm, sunny Sunday afternoon for a little patio get together with friends. Smack dab in the middle of the scenic and quaint Unionville Main Street.    I ordered a spicy Caesar to go with my fish tacos. My bill came to around $20 with tip. The food itself was fresh and I was a fan of the chipotle mayo they threw on top of the tacos. I've been here a couple times before and the food is consistently tasty- although the Caesar may have been verging on the edge of being TOO spicy.   The service here is slow. however, the place was packed so the service lag was understandable. If you're really in a rush, this isn't the place for you. But general you'd come here to enjoy a chilled out evening on the patio.   The parking on Main Street is a total nightmare. Especially on a nice day, the entire place is jam packed with cars. The parking behind Jake's is very cramped and poorly laid out. TIP: Park further out in quieter areas of the neighbourhood and enjoy the nice stroll out to Main."}
{"text":"Since everyone was complaining about the poor service I decided to go right when it opened at 11:30am on a Monday. There were about 5 tables being served outside on the patio and there were 5 waitresses ready to serve. Service was quick and friendly.  Beef dip sandwich $11.99 - comes with option of fries and or salad. Thick layer of thinly sliced beef. The au jus dip made the sandwich so flavorful. Definitely a drinkable gravy sauce. The fries were some of the best that I can remember. It was so crispy and seemed like it had an outer layer of crispy batter. (4 stars)  Lobster and crab grilled cheese sandwich $14.99 - also comes with option of fries or salad. Loads of real lobster meat. None of that fake filler crap you find in other places. Salad was fresh and crunchy. (4 stars)  Fried crab cakes $11.99 - two pieces. Totally not worth it. Outside was crispy and inside was soft just like I expected but it just failed to impress. (3 stars)"}
{"text":"Jake's is simply one of those pubs everyone under 25 who lives in Markham seems to know about. In fact, it's probably one of those pubs everyone under 25 who lives in Markham seems to have been to! So of course when I mention to my friends I've never been to Jake's, they were completely shocked. Herp derp, I don't go out to Main Street Unionville that often!  Anyway...I only ordered a rum and coke here since I didn't want to be too drunk (my parents aren't those kind of people). Surprisingly I was only charged $4, even though I was told it was $6 (I gave a $10, double checked and I got three toonies in return). It tasted okay, I mean it's hard to screw up alcoholic drinks unless you simply can't taste alcohol at all.  Service was meh. I had $10 out for a long time, but the bartender never came to take my order until my friend yelled at her because he wanted another drink, in which she finally realized I had the $10 out. Other than that I didn't have many problems with this place."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, average service but a great location & patio for summer days makes Jake's on Main still a place to hang out for some pub food and drinks (but probably only when it's nice out).   Located on Main Street Unionville, Jake's is one of the busier spots on the street when the weather is nice out. I actually visit often but mainly just for a place to hang out and enjoy the nice weather with a cold beer. The food is average but I think makes the cut for a basic local pub. Menu consists of a mix of apps (nachos, calamari, etc...), burgers, pastas and such. Stuff you'd expect at a typical pub. Service is typically fine but may get slow when it gets busy (and it sometimes gets really busy). The best thing about this place is the large patio, and there are def great vibes here on summer weekend nights sometimes even with a live DJ.   I'd recommend visiting for a drink on the patio when it is nice out."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out, was given a table on the patio but becauce it got chilly we requested to move inside. Our server Rachel was very nice and press prepared a table for us instantly. Live music playing and people gathered around to dance, simply enjoyable.   I was not impressed with the food, average. Ordered the Clam chowder (soup of the day) - not bad but loaded with veggies, bacon cheess burger poutine - the beef on it was too salty, seafood fettucine- lots of seafood, worth every buck,  canadiana pizza - normal.  Service went downhill after we were moved inside. Rarely she checked on us and we need to ask other servers for our bill. Only to be told she will get our server to give us our bill which took a while."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are slowly trying out all the restaurants in Unionville. After looking at all the menus, we settled on Jake's since they had reasonable prices.   He got a beer and I ordered a virgin lime margarita ($3.99). The virgin lime margarita was very sour (which I like). We decided to share the all star platter which includes deep fried pickles, onion rings, fries, potato skins and jalapeno poppers (I hope I'm not missing anything). There's a lot of fried stuff in this platter so I would suggest sharing it between 4 people instead of 2 if you don't want to feel sick afterwards. The jalapeno poppers weren't spicy at all and was stuffed with cream cheese. The highlight of the platter was the potato skin because it was loaded with bacon bits topped with melted cheese.  I would be coming back to try some of the other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"The swiss burger was amazing.  Came here on a friday evening and the service was waaaaay to slow,  took about 50 minutes for our food to arrive.   The patio is nice though."}
{"text":"I've been to Jake's many times before but i think this will be the last. Two words to describe my experience: HORRIBLE service.  To start off we waited an hour for a table of 8 and they assumed we wanted the patio so they didn't even offer us a table inside (there were free tables inside). Afterwards when we were seated, our server took our order and disappeared for pretty much for the rest of the night.   I would say almost half our orders were wrong. - We ordered Mexican fries but they gave us coney fries instead and even tried to convince us that they gave us coney fries. (We had the menu in front of us so we knew the difference) - my friend ordered fries and got salad instead -another ordered double fish and chips and got a single instead -all the orders came out at different times and they even missed one of our orders -one order did not even make it to our table, my friend had to eat at home afterwards.. - we asked 5 different waitresses before our water was refilled -asked for the manager a couple times before he showed up to our table  The manager did give us 15% off after we complained but I don't think it was enough for us to return another time.  Overall the food was good but not sure if I will go back after this experience!!"}
{"text":"Spent the afternoon on the patio at Jakes having some lunch and drinks. Patio is huge and gives a nice view of Main Street. The drinks were extra cold which was perfect on this sunny afternoon. We started with the Nachos which were good. The chili made them a bit soggy but we gobbled them up. I wish there was more cheese on the lower levels but they were still good.  I had the cheeseburger which was two patties but they weren't homemade which was a little disappointing.  They were still moist and cooked perfectly.  Fries on he side were good.  The wife had the California Club and she enjoyed it. The food is typical pub food which is fine. We always come to Jakes for the patio and drinks. It's a great atmosphere for hanging out as a couple and also with friends. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came to Jakes at a great time! Weather was just right, people playing street music, people watching by the street with many different dynamics. The servers were pleasant, but Mmm if you saw the nachos, you'd go Mmmmm . Then again I speak on behalf of cheesy nacho lovers ;)"}
{"text":"As a Markham local, Jake's is one of my favourite places to grab a quick lunch with mom and/or engage in hours of serious 'girl talk' with my friends.  When I come to Jake's I typically order the grilled chicken breast fillet. However, about a week ago I wasn't feeling too too hungry so I thought I'd give the chicken fingers a shot. I split the average sized portion with a friend. Although the fingers were not freshly breaded (or didn't look like they were) they ended up tasting pretty good! They were significantly crispier than your average frozen fingers, not too greasy with a hint of spice. To top it all off, the fries here are also fabulous - VERY crispy and not drowning in oil! What is more, unlike most places, Jake's doesn't charge you extra if you want to substitute the fries for a caesar salad.  Despite being fairly impressed with the fingers at Jake's, I will continue to order my usual grilled chicken breast fillet when I revisit this place because it is healthier and offers a larger portion with many different sides (e.g., fries, salad, garlic bread) for nearly the same price.

{"text":"About average. Service was average as well. Our waitress was likely tired from her shift that day..as the place was extremely busy. We were lucky to have only waited 5 mins for the table.   The patio area is wonderful on a nice warm day. Had lunch here and ordered a Goat Cheese pizza (Pesto, garlic, red peppers and goat cheese). I love this type of pizza but thought they could be a little more generous with the ingredients. It was still good though.   Tried a bite of the lobster crab grilled cheese. Imho, not the greatest. A bit bland, not enough ingredients, & a bit fishy tasting (like it sat out too long). Eks!"}
{"text":"This place has okay food and mediocre service. There is literally nothing special about it. It's not even super cheap for me to want to go back. I say skip this place and check out something else in the area."}
{"text":"Went there for Sunday dinner with my wife and 2 kids, wasn't busy, food came out pretty fast but the food itself is subpar, and overpriced."}
{"text":"Wings and nachos are great. The various poutines are huge servings and taste great. The beer is cold and the patio is great for taking in Unionville sites."}
{"text":"Very busy on the long weekend but they managed to squeeze us in. We just had a few light snacks but boy were they filling and good. Had the chilli fries and it was huge! That could have been a meal in itself!   Staff was friendly and fast despite how busy it was. Everyone was outside and it was a beautiful day for it."}
{"text":"Giving it a 3 star for the price. It is overpriced for the food. Don't get me wrong, service was amazing and the drink selection was good too. All I have to say is that they have kronenburg blanc on TAP!! Very rare to find a resto with this on tap and it makes me go wild! But if you're there order a pitcher or a pint of it if you can!   Food- I ordered the lobster grilled cheese. It was pretty good. At the end of the day nothing too spectacular but kudos for the grilled cheese idea. My friend ordered the steak frites. Their gravy is amazing, rich and savory. Didn't let out with the yam fries which were pretty good as well. The steak, a bit thin, but good. I would recommend the steak frites. As for the grilled cheese, I would try something else on their large menu selection!   Patio- best patio on main street unionville. Would definitely come back on a sunny day to grab a drink!   Parking - right behind the resto. Might be packed sometimes, but there's parking in the curling arena most days. :)"}
{"text":"I went to Jakes on Main for Victoria day to meet up some friends from high school.  The previous night I made a reservation before 10:30pm, and left my name and the party count.  When we arrived at our reservation time a bit after the time I set (7pm), the girl at front said that the restaurant was packed, and when I left my name she said that they did not take reservations.  After asking who I spoke with last night (I did not get his name), a guy who works there said that they did not take reservations.  Looks like miscommunication there.  Other than that the food was good for a pub, and would have given 4 stars if not for the miscommunication.  Ended up the wait only was like 20 mins even though they said it would take an hour, for my party of 6."}
{"text":"Jakes has a great patio for beers and wings. In fact the menu is large and long. However the cleanliness inside and out is bad enough that I will not go back. Dropped food is not picked up, trash left on the indoor restaurant floor.  But worst in the disgusting conditions of the bathrooms. I can't believe it passes inspection."}
{"text":"Best patio anywhere.  I did 11 am till around 1am yesterday during the Unionville Festival (aka Canada's own Mardi Gras).   Food is alright... like any bar.  Waitresses are friendly and make you think you have a chance with them, which is appreciated.  The best part is that when you're stumbling home from there and walking down beautiful Unionville Main street, you feel like a guest star on the Gilmour Girls...only you're that guest star they wish they never hired because you're ruining the show.   great times always.  Easily the best patio  in southern Ontario."}
{"text":"Used to go here when I was younger. It is a large house converted into a pub. There is a large bar inside and to the left. When the weather is nice, they open the front area with seating and another bar. There's an upstairs level with pool (I think it's still there). Lots of tables, lots of chances to have a good time. Of note, I did puke my guts up on the stairs of Jake's. Thanks for the good times."}
{"text":"Have passed by this place numerous time while walking down Main street, and thought it was time to check it out. Came during a nice sunny day, the best time to take advantage of the large patio area.   Was surprised how busy it was, but I suppose it makes sense given all the traffic walking by, and this place having the largest and most visible patio. We were lucky to get seated almost immediately, as pretty much everyone after us had to quite a wait to get seats (20+ minutes).   Seeing as how busy it was, I can understand the servers seeming a bit stressed out/overwhelmed. We had to ask our server twice to give us a new napkin (it was a bit dirty with what was probably dirt/leaves), but I guess this comes with the territory when you eat on a patio with several large trees above you. The view was quite nice though on a beautiful day, and all the outdoor tables had umbrellas available if you wanted some shade.  I picked the lobster and crab grilled cheese - although it was grilled nicely, it had a strong 'fishy' taste to it that kind of overwhelmed the cheese flavour, and any other ingredients that were in the sandwich. It was not bad, but definitely not the best I've had. Fairly standard string fries, with decent portion.   Food here is just Ok, but is a great spot to have a drink, do some people watching, and take in some rays."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of co-workers on a Saturday night. The environment is cozy. Looks the it used to be an old house. We mostly had finger food and beers. Service was great and the food was on par with other pubs. There's plenty of TVs to watch game. Parking can be limited if the place is busy."}
{"text":"Went there many times since getting a job nearby during summer. Food is great except for a few items on the menu. The best items are the poutines, nachos and fish chips. I would avoid the fish tacos and wings, they were mediocre.   The food is $20-16 for most menu, it's worth the money. They could easily raise the prices compared to other places with similar quality. I feel that the people who give bad reviews don't realize it's a casual place, not high end. The washroom could be cleaner and the service faster but it's acceptable. The food is probably the best part, love the fries!"}
{"text":"I really want to like Jake's On Main..  The patio is huge and it will be so cool to hang out here and have a drink under those umbrellas on a hot, sunny afternoon...  But.. Services here really sucks!!!  The hostess put us at a table close to their roof with water dripping on my friend's head.. and when I told her that, she just said it is just too bad.... and there were tons of empty tables around so I just move myself to another table.  Services extremely slow... but luckily we were not in a big rush.. but our lunch last almost 2 hours on a weekday?! Maybe I just look like I am retired and have plenty of time.  Food wise is meh, but I don't expect much from a pub style food establishment.   Meat Pot Pie ($9.99) is on the salty side... really really salty but an excuse to have more beer??  Fish Tacos ($9.99) is not bad but the side green salad is like days old.. a little rotten and little soggy...  I should have go back to Blacksmith's Bistro instead! Sorry, Kris U, I should have read your review!!! FAIL!!"}
{"text":"Bland, tasteless food and horribly slow service. The waiter we had seemed nice at first but very fake  and even threw in some petty remarks when taking away our half eaten plates. When we gave a small tip, she looked at the machine for a good 10 seconds, rolled her eyes and walked away."}
{"text":"The patio is nice, the food is alright, but where this place really lacks is the service. Don't come here if you're starving, you may pass out waiting for your food. I liked my pulled pork sandwich, it was really great"}
{"text":"Jake's reins supreme in patio seating on Unionville Main Street.  I enjoyed a Coors Light at Jake's in the afternoon before Canada Day.  It was heavenly, as if daily stress was a far away memory.  It took a while for the food to arrive.  The calamari was average at best, even though it washed down well with the beer.  The services was polite and effective, and was a saving grace to the overall experience.  I have to give a premium to the well maintained and spacious patio.  The rating is 4 stars if you get to enjoy the patio in a warm summer afternoon.  If you dine indoors, food is 2 stars, and service +1 star."}
{"text":"I wanna say this is the worst experience I had...  the location is good. Not too close to the street so not too noisy and no worries that dust might go to your plate. The waitress looked friendly and smiled too.   BUT  1. when my friend and me were at the entrance of the fence, there were still plates on our table.  The reception lady cleaned our table with a dirty cloth nearby... She just moped away the food residues on the table.   2. We sit down. I wanted to go to the washroom. It,s downstairs. I did not find it as the sign was blocked by someone when I entered the house door.  I asked a waitress, she told me it was downstairs, but did not show me where were the stairs to get downstairs... I even walked out of the house... Then I see a customer coming up from the stairs and found it.   3. The washroom was the disgusting part. There were a  few used toilet paper on the floor. I went to the innermost one. After I did some cleaning and sat down, I felt something on my leg. Yes, I believe it was a bee! If it was not a bee, then some insect, some kind of disgusting creature in a washroom, near a toilet...... But I was afraid that it would bite... and there was no phone signal in the washroom as it was in the basement. I gently moved it away with some tissue. Then the bee crawled to the neighbor seat.    4. I was scared, went out and wanted to clean my hands, and leg... The liquid soap box was empty.  Then I tried to at,least dry,my hands. There was a dry machine, but no tissue for drying hands.   5. The food did not take too long. We grabbed the fork sets on our own as the reception lady forgot and was busy. It was ok.  We all ordered ribs and Buffalo chicken. I suggest do not take the Buffalo chicken. The fries tasted good.   6. We asked for the bill when a young male took our finished dishes away. Then we had been waiting for the bill for around 15 min. It did not feel good as the day got chilly fast at night. Then the lady came and we requested again. Then another 5 min until another lady put down the bill fast and a little unfriendly... We were going give her the card so that she could avoid a second trip. She just walked away too fast to talk. Then another 5 min to have the first lady to fetch the card machine, but we waited for around 10 min for her to grab the payment. We just tipped 10? and left asap. Two of us got cold...  Today is May 7. I hope they can improve after today."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm pretty sure everyone knows the area itself is nice, and the vibe at this pub is pretty good. However, the service.. not so much. Our waitress did check up on us, but hardly. Whenever we needed her, she was no where to be found and we had to order with other waitresses. At the end our bill had 2 random items, and luckily our waitress realized before we checked the bill, apologized and reprinted us a new bill (apparently it was supposed to be for two tables behind us).   Our food was okay. I got the BBQ chicken pizza, while I was eating a slice, I'm like wow it tastes good, then I started getting to the bottom and realized how burnt the crust was. It was so burnt I had to rip off all the crust before eating it (pretty sure you can tell on my picture)."}
{"text":"I really tried to give this place a chance despite all the bad reviews below but I have to agree with them 100%!  My party and I waited 45 minutes for a table and kept checking with the hostess to see if there were any tables ready. After a while, they finally realized we were willing to go for any table and did not prefer to sit at the patio as they assumed. We were then seated inside where many vacant tables were available.   When our waitress took our orders, we were surprised she didn't write anything down. Sure enough, the orders were wrong and had to be corrected. Even as our food came out, the busboy didn't even call it out properly.   The waitress also asked if we wanted some of our appetizers as starters which was pretty useless because it came later with the table's entrees. As the entrees came, more mistakes came but we didn't bother to correct them as it would have taken longer to get our food. On top messing up orders badly, a whole entree was omitted and when we checked the status with the waitress, she claimed we didn't order it at all!   Everytime I needed assistance, I had to walk up to get the waitress which is very unacceptable. I had to ask three different waitresses for the manager and he luckily helped out the situation in the end as much as he could after the fact. Paying the bill was another long waiting period but at that point I was used to waiting for any type of service.  The only thing that saved the day was the steak and mushrooms poutine which was amazing. None of my party of 8 was satisfied tonight."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend. This place has a huge patio which is nicely shaded with trees.  Perfect place to grab drinks and snacks with a friend. Food was okay, wasn't bad but didn't stand out either.  I had fish tacos and my friend had a burgers. Both came with fries. I enjoyed the fries more than the tacos; crispy and delicious . Will come back for more patio sitting"}
{"text":"Crammed, slow service (what service?), dirty, and what did they serve me? This place used to be good, the last two times I was there it was disappointing. First of all the indoor seating was crammed. Once I got to my table it was dirty, crumbs everywhere; on the table, on the floor....  Service was bad, waited a long  time for a waitress to come ask us about for drinks or food. By the time she came we were ready to order.   I ordered the Calypso Mahi Mahi (which took more than 25min to get here), suppose to come with rice but it came with fries? Sauteed vegetable was definately not sauteed it was more on the raw side like a salad but the pieces they gave me were garbage quality; crumbs of broccoli and cauliflower florets. The overall portion was small.   Getting the bill was also difficult, the waitress was at the back talking to another waiter. Even after asking for the bill it still took a while for it to come. They handed the machine to me asking me to insert the card but what was my total? I had to ask for the total.... seriously I don't  know why I even tip them.   Btw my other experience, if you sit in the patio on  a warm summer night, once it gets dark, you might experience rats running around."}

{"text":"TLDR: Decent place to grab a drink and catch up with some friends. Typical bar/pub restaurant. Interior is a bit old looking.   After a walk around Toogood Pond Park (just north of the restaurant), my friend and I wanted to grab a drink at a sit down place. Every time we walked down Main Street, we always see a crowd of people at this restaurant, so we thought to try it out. There wasn't a lot of people since we came around 2:30pm! Prices are similar to that in downtown toronto (pint of beer for $7-9, burgers for $13-17).   Anyways, about the food: I got the rancho burger (onion ring, bacon, mozzarella and ranch sauce) with fries, and my friend got the pub's daily pie, which was the steak and mushroom, and a side of the French onion soup.  The burger comes with 2, 4oz patties! Yum, but I can tell that the patties are not made in house (is it much like the m&m burger patties). The fries were super crispy, just the way I like it!  My friend's steak and mushroom pie was mediocre, I couldn't taste must mushrooms from the 3 scoops I had, but there was decent amount of steak inside! I wasn't a fan of the French onion soup (I just don't like French onion soup :P), but my friend loved it.   Will I be back? Well, maybe, their selection of grill cheeses/tacos/poutines looked very appealing :)"}
{"text":"Jakes on main, where to start. I feel like anyone that lives in Markham/unionville has been here at least once, for most people, that's enough to realize this place is nothing great.   The food, horrible. The prices however, would have you wondering where the hell the rest of your meal is.. I seriously do not recommend coming here for dinner. Or any food for that matter. Unless frozen calamari and soggy nachos are your thing.  I have had better food from a stand on a Cuban beach.   At the end of the day this place has its patio and a great location. That's what keeps it busy. Beer on a patio on a nice summer day? It's a no brainer. And that's why it's always bumping in the summer. Come here on a Friday in the winter, it's either a ghost town or a wanna be nightclub full of teeny-boppers.   Avoid, head to the arms across the street instead."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a drink on a summer night. 1 night they had a live singer there taking requests. They used to serve Hoegaarden, but the waitress said that people weren't ordering it as much, so they took it off their menu. The foods okay, typical bar food, nachos, wraps, etc, nothing really stood out. What I love about this place is the atmosphere. Good place to chill if your within the Richmond Hill/Markham region."}
