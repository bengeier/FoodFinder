{"text":"Let's get this out of the way: I am Italian born and bred so I have more than a passing knowledge of what Italian food should be and taste like.My daughter and her family were in town and having read of Piazza al Forno we decided to stop at the Phoenix location for lunch after a morning spent at the Science Center. What a mistake! There were six of us and most of us ordered the pizza. The dough was undercooked or should I say chewy and almost raw, The tomato sauce was a poor imitation of Italian tomato sauce, watery and awful, and the little bitty pieces of mozzarella on the pizza were pitiful! What a disappointment! To add insult to injury the water they served had a metallic taste that made it undrinkable.Overall I wish I could give a -2 review. It was that bad!"}
{"text":"Called ahead to let them know we were coming. When we showed up, they wouldn't honor our call ahead saying they had since \"gotten busy\". What is the point of a call ahead queue if they won't honor your spot?

There were tables available, they just wouldn't put them together to accommodate us. Even worse was their attitude about the whole thing. Went across the street to Hanny's, much better attitude and friendly service. If you are considering Piazza, check out Hannys which also serves pizza and is just across the street."}
{"text":"Wow! A gem and a find. These guys know what they are doing. Got a margarita pizza and it may have been the best I've ever had. The crust was a little chewy but in a flavorful way and the sauce and spices kicked in with subtle timing that speak to their expertise. Great interior and staff. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"There are better pizza places then this. I'd rather go to Pizzeria Bianco, Pomo, or Nook even. 

Service was so-so. Understandably, there was a large party also in the restaurant, but besides them, the rest of the room was empty. 

The quality wasn't bad, but I think they are missing something in their pizza dough. Some kind of seasoning, a little bit more pepper or salt, something. I doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"I will give only one star, but that is even too generous.  We were excited to go and try La Piazza Locale after hearing positive reviews.  It was the worst pizza we had ever eaten in our lives.  We come from an Italian background, my husband was born in Sicily.  They advertise San Marzano tomatoes, but we saw cans of Nina's tomatoes in the hallway.  You can purchase these tomatoes at Sam's club for $2.75 for #10 can.  The pizza was raw and inedible.   No one approached us to ask what was wrong.  We ate one slice a piece, then asked for the check.  The waitress packed the pizza, but we left it behind.  I will never eat there again.  I would highly discourage anyone from eating at this establishment.  I am embarrassed that they would call themselves Italian. Carmela R."}
{"text":"On business travel and found this place as I walked by. Dinner for one, so I sat at the bar. Ordered the Margherita D.O.C and Calamari Fritti. The pizza was good and the calamari was ridiculously good. It was a weeknight and quite busy so the waitresses seemed a bit stressed with each other. I was sitting alone so I observed everything going on around me. However, the young waitress that served me was kind, gracious and attentive even on a busy night."}
{"text":"The service is not as good as its food.  The waitress forgot to bring forks to is until we asked. She seemed to feel not interested in her work that day."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had. This place is perfect. Try the Rubicon IPA it's delicious. I had a veggie pizza everything was perfect."}
{"text":"love this place. simple delicious food. friendly and impeccable service. makes you feel like a regular from the first visit - which will likely really make you a regular."}
{"text":"Found myself here by mistake - dried out contacts. Decided to stay after seeing the attention to detail the staff exhibited and the food delivered to the table next to me. As I was done the owner stopped to check in - wonderful business I would seek out again."}
{"text":"Great quality food! Make me wish I lived in PHX!"}
{"text":"I wandered in knowing nothing about the place.  AMAZING pizza.  Terrific service.  Alisha was a great, friendly server.  The owner was there and super nice guy.  They've only been open a month, but they have it figured out.  Put this on your must go places in downtown Phoenix. I'm going back for lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"La Piazza is always consistent and always fabulous! Love their daily specials as well as the classics. I've enjoyed pizza, salads, panini's and most recently puttenesca. I try not to get the same thing twice to continue to try all of their great dishes. Never disappointed. 

Try it, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"My husband and I returned this evening and had the Burratta e Speck appetizer, Margherita DOC pizza and Cannoli.  We love this place, which is VPN certified so you know you are getting true Napoletan style pizza.  Honestly, I can't  seem to get excited about anything other than this style of pizza ever again, so simple and flavorful that my eyes roll back into my head every time I eat there.  I can't wait to try their pastas.  The Cannoli was amazing.  The texture was beautiful and the serving was probably twice as large as what I expected.  I had it was a double shot of espresso; the perfect thing.

The only thing that we would have changed was the music, which was sort of rap influenced, American Idol style mainstream stuff that I'd expect to hear in a gym, or some run of the mill college pizza pub. But this is not college pizza pub pizza but pizza designed for a more sophisticated palette so homogenized pop/rap just doesn't suit.  I'm not saying they need to play Mario Lanza recordings or anything but something that connects a little more with the food and Italian culture would be sort of unique and special.  We've been in a couple of times this summer and the music just doesn't make any sense.  Maybe if they streamed in an Italian radio station, with contemporary Italian artists it would be an even more stimulating sensory experience.  Of course, if they wanted to have Puccini and Verdi playing some of the time, I'd just bring my cribbage board and never leave.

We arrived on our bicycles by the way and it was nice to find bike parking right out front, by the way."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Phoenix! The crust is amazing from the imported wood-burning oven! And the toppings are very high quality! Really delicious and a great value! My husband and I typically split the arugula salad, then a pizza and top it off with a heavenly cannoli. Super friendly family-run business. I take all my friends there."}
{"text":"O...M...G...So AMAZING! First, I admit I don't write reviews, I read them, BUT, I had to for La Piazza Locale.  This place is the real deal. Like you are IN Italy.  I have been raving about their pizza for a few years (seriously, super authentic), and I always crave their calzone (pizza fritte) which is like heaven in your mouth (get extra sauce to dip the amazing crust.)
BUT...then I ventured to the pasta, and I was blown away.  I am a back east girl, grew up eating authentic Italian food and Sunday gravy, and I am telling you their Ragu Nepoletano (with cheese--a must) was absolutely unbelievable. Each bite I could not believe this was from my little unassuming downtown joint. The pasta was delicate and perfectly cooked (tasted homemade to me), and the gravy, mmm mmm mmm the gravy (pasta sauce) was heaven: savory and rich-but-light and perfectly seasoned, the meat was super tender and melted in your mouth with the pasta, and the imported cheese topping it off; I am telling you it is the BEST Italian food I have had in 25 years (and that includes when I go back home I admit!)  Plus, the portion is so generous, there is enough for two. I am obsessed and you will be too.

As I mentioned, the pizza is amazing, the flavors just burst in your mouth, whether a simple Margherita or a more complex choice - everything is amazing, fresh and satisfying.  They use products that are certified Italian (D.O.C.) and you can taste it.

I haven't tried everything because I am prone to cave to my obsessions, but I cannot imagine there is disappointment on the menu.  The restaurant is unassuming and simple, but it belies the amazing food within. Delicious."}
{"text":"The up beat casual atmosphere was overshadowed only by one of the most tasteful italian sausage pizza on the perfectly baked thin crust."}
{"text":"I've been to the old Glendale location a few times and have now been here now 3 times, and this place just keeps getting better every time I visit. There's one waiter I get every time, and he always gives me great recommendations on new things to try or old favorites I might have missed. My favorite pizza with toppings (possibly of all time, competing with the similar \"Zoli\" at Il Cane Rosso in Dallas) is the Italian Stallion, and the last time I went he also suggested the Montanara which is effectively a margherita pizza but they take the dough and flash fry it before putting on the toppings and then tossing it in the brick oven to finish. Now I have to order both or I feel like I'm missing out! Their calamari is great as well as the burratta for appetizers (ask for focaccia to go with the burratta), and they usually have some sort of delicious dessert that involves Nutella to finish it all off. Since it's not their fault, I can't take anything away from them for this, but since it's downtown Phoenix parking can be a little challenging. For some places I wouldn't bother, but La Piazza PHX is always well worth the trip. 

P.S. It's also deservedly the New Times \"Best of Phoenix\" Best Gourmet Pizza 2014: http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/bestof/2014/award/best-gourmet-pizza-4454001/"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza & excellent service.  Pizza takes a little long but it's because everything is prepared fresh.  Kid friendly too.  I'll definitely make it point to come back next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Not an expert in styles of pizza, so walked in and asked what would be awesome for my tast. And ended up with one of the best pizzas of my life."}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant based on other reviews on \"YELP\" and we were not disappointed!  Our party of four split a lettuce house salad and a spinach salad and two pizzas, a Margherita with  Pepporoni and one with home made mozzarella and sausage.  The crusts were crispy outside and very light inside and arrived at our table piping hot despite how busy the place was!  Our server and even other servers who checked on us were very friendly and efficient!  We will return whenever we are downtown for an event!  Very close to the U S Airway Center?"}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful atmosphere. If you are in Downtown Phoenix definitely stop in!!"}
{"text":"This place had amazing food that came fast. Our group ended up getting about 4 extra meals just to try as many things as we could."}
{"text":"We were going to the symphony hall nearby for a concert and chose this place for dinner. The line was not long and we got seated in 10-15 minutes. We ordered the Italian Stallion pizza and Poronoma (a name like this) spaghetti and they were both super delicious! I love the spaghetti very much because every ingredient inside matched quite well with each other. However, I am a little bit disappointed about the service. It was getting busy at that time and we waited for over half an hour for the pizza because they mixed us with the table next to ours. The two ladies sat down later than us but got their pizza more quickly than we did. This made us a bit annoyed but the flavor of food could make it up."}
{"text":"Yelp didn't let me down. Very good, authentic (and authenticated) Italian bistro. Good service nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"La Piazza PHX is my favorite place for pizza in a city with many great pizza choices. I work downtown so it's easy for me to get here but I'd make the trip even if I didn't. The pizza is authentic and made with high quality ingredients. I'm vegetarian so the only pizza I can really talk about is the Napoletana. It is the perfect balance of crust, sauce, cheese and toppings. The meat-eaters I have brought here loved their pizzas as well. The servers are friendly and reasonably knowledgeable. I hope La Piazza has a long life in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town awesome staff to must check this place out awesome repeats it was cooked just right again by far best pizza in town"}
{"text":"So, rarely this happens. It started with the caprese. The mozzarella was clearly made there. The pizza is something I have yet to find in the southwest, terrific. I had the Don(meat pizza). This one of the best I have and in some time.  No surprise this family owned jewel traces its roots back to New Jersey and beyond that , Italy. Admittedly a Jersey boy , I was impressed. Do yourself a favor if you are anywhere near downtown Phoenix, check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding. Great service unbelievably delicious flavors. We drove from Chandler to try it the first night. Amazing. Second time we came we were just in the neighborhood. Consistent. Delicious. Worth every penny.

As for the spaz who wrote \"people who like this place must be sheltered\", I've worked at some of the best restaurants on the west coast and have a sommelier degree.  I can't speak on your experience here on a particular night. But I know food. And this place has amazing flavors.  Good luck with any other foolish generalizations you will certainly make in the future."}
{"text":"I never am one to complain openly about an experience at a restaurant but felt compelled to share ours.  We were a group of 7 on a Tuesday night. Waited maybe 15 minutes for our table...no big deal. 

The service was by far the worst part of our dining experience. Sever brought water, but failed to ask for additional drinks. Appetizers came out rather quickly and we're delicious (fried mozzarella), but the server took our orders and seemed to disappear. I had to ask a different server for another beer. 

When the food finally came everyone received their food except for me. Also, our salads arrived with the pizzas instead of being brought out prior, maybe this is a standard for the restaurant, but odd nonetheless. 

My food arrived just about the time everyone was finished.  Pizza (montanerro) was good, I wouldn't say worth the wait. 

Finally, when it was time to pay the bill it took over 45 minutes once the server took our cards (7 different checks). The server ended up losing one of our cards in the 10ft walk between our table the POS. The card hasn't been found and ended up had to be canceled through the bank. 

Food was good, but not worth the terrible service."}
{"text":"Yes! Italian hubby approved! Nice little gem, great for families, fresh ingredients and very friendly staff. The portions are good and they can customize the pizza's to meet your dietary needs. Wish I would have taken a picture before we inhaled the appetizers and food! Need to return!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza here I really recommend this place to anyone who is a pizza lover. Place is conveniently located really close to my office so I usually stop by after work."}
{"text":"First time in Phoenix, so first time at this restaurant.  In a group of about 36 people (volleyball girls and families).  Place is small, so it took awhile to get seated.  Our group was segregated into three subgroups.  Servers could not (or did not want to) make out separate checks for each family, so we had to figure out the bill per subgroup.

But all the somewhat frustrating stuff aside, the food was excellent, the service was excellent, and we all enjoyed a great meal together.  It was a fun night for our team and we would definitely come back again next year should we choose to play in the Volleyball Festival."}
{"text":"What's not to love here?  Food is awesome. Services is quick. Ambiance is relaxed and chill. And on this particular Saturday night our soundtrack was 80's rock. Does not get any better than that!!!  Take a walk from your downtown hotel and come to this place. You will not be sorry you did."}
{"text":"Seated immediately. Nice decor more rustic meets modern. Set up so it's not too crowded. Cool temp not cold. Waitstaff and owner were personable and friendly. Made suggestions and were descriptive. Dolce Diavolo pizza was surprisingly delicious. Enough spice to taste the other flavors. Risotto Balls were crispy and great sauce on the side. Overall enjoyable experience & plan to come back only if they incorporate Craft Beers!!! *hint hint"}
{"text":"Good food, but they're way too skimpy on the toppings. I had two pieces of basil on my margarita pizza. Two. I'd go back for a cheese pizza but not much more."}
{"text":"We came here late after a volleyball tournament with our kids and were absolutely blown away.  This is authentic Italian pizza.  Everyone in my family loved the food. My wife and I have both been to Italy and this is as good as anything you would find in the best pizza locations in Sicily... Great, friendly service too!!"}
{"text":"I was pressed for time today so I ordered the Calzone (Pizza Fritti) to go.  From the moment I opened the box, I could tell this calzone, was different from any other one that I have had in the past.  Unlike other calzones that you get in other \"pizza\" restaurants, these are fried, instead of baked, using the same \"certified authentic\" dough used to make their wonderful pizzas.  The result is a soft and chewy dough that holds the fillings in check, and is a delicacy all on it's own.

The calzone comes filled with salami, ricotta cheese, house-made mozzarella, and San Marzano tomatoes, all playing together in harmony as they dance across your palate.   And although not listed on the menu, mine contained a few ripe olives which at first surprised me, but added a whole new complexity to the experience.

La Piazza Locale continues to impress me, and if YOU only remember one part of my review during YOUR visit, it is this:  \"Experience as written!\"   A lot of thought went into the items on the menu and they are beautifully crafted with flavors in perfect balance...Do not mess with perfection."}
{"text":"When you stop and think about it Pizza is pretty simple food. Good crust, sauce and cheese. This place rocks all three with a home made feel and taste. To top it off the music was like revisiting the 80's best rock.

Great food with fair prices. A must eat when downtown."}
{"text":"Chill staff; good food; good beer - dropped in for beer and pizza on my first night in downtown Phoenix.  The crust is really nice and the sauce delicious.  I had the Caprese followed by the \"Italian Stallion.\"  The Caprese needed more seasoning and the tomatoes could be more zesty and more fresh basil would've been nice.  The pizza was very satisfying. I'd come back again."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the BEST Italian restaurant I have been to In the US.  I live in San Francisco, home to many outstanding Italian restaurants.  Who knew the best is in Downtown Phoenix?!  I am in town three days and came back for a second visit because it was that good.  The pizza crust is perfect, the service delightful, and the ricotta cheesecake (homemade) out of this world.  I wish I could pack this restaurant in my suitcase and bring it back because there is so much more I want to try!"}
{"text":"Don't stop here. Extremely bad service..... in the middle of taking my order the server walked away to deliver food to another table then came back and finished taking our order then about 1 minute later my wife got her food and where told the rest will be out shortly so 25 min later the rest of our food makes it to the table by then her food was cold.This is a horrible establishment. reason the server got a tip is because he added gratuity. Bad pizza. It was very bland and their food is overpriced. I can guarantee you'll find better pizza places downtown, just not here."}
{"text":"I was really excited to eat here. My husband is a huge proponent of downtown areas.  Me, a little less.  It was busy downtown maybe a game going on.  Parking was a little dicey and although there is parking available on the street and a small lot across the street we still found the parking a little challenging. It is certainly not a deal breaker.  

We started out with the Palle di Riso.  I thought they were light on seasoning and had one small piece of rapini and mozzarella.  They also left a bitter after taste that I attributed to oil that was dirty.  The tomato sauce was also lacking flavor and was very flat. 

We next shared the Rucola salad.  We added the prosciutto which was a $2 up charge.  The salad was lovely.  The prosciutto was very good and very good tasting.  The arugula was sweet and nutty.  

We chose the napoletana because of the more unusual ingredients.   It was good and salty which you would expect with capers, olives and anchovies.  I would have like to have seen more basil on the pie.  The basil did a good job balancing out the saltiness.  Again I thought the pie sauce was a little tasteless and the cheese in the pie was a tad light.  The dough was Excellent.  Some of the best I have ever tasted and I hail from the east coast.  It was really the best thing about the pie.

The wine list is mostly Italian and we found a Malbec that was nice to drink.  Would I come back?   Probably not.  There are other pizza joints I have enjoyed a lot more.  I usually agree with howard on his reviews.  Unfortunately, this one didn't meet the mark."}
{"text":"We walked into this restaurant and were not acknowledged. We waited for a while as servers walked by avoiding eye contact. Finally, we approached someone and he said he will get a table ready for us in the back (despite the open tables in the front that were ready). He then comes back and says, \"just to let you know we are no longer making pizzas.\" Uhhh. Okay?

You close in one hour. 
You have a restaurant FULL of people. 
It takes 15 mins tops to make a pizza. 

I call bullshit. I call racism. Your staff is disgusting as is your service. 

**UPDATE**

Someone from the restaurant messaged me regarding the review and stated that they were out of pizza dough and that's why they couldn't accommodate us. If that were the case, why didn't that guy just say that instead of \"we are no longer making pizzas\"? Those are two completely different statements. I rest my case."}
{"text":"Great classic Italian Neapolitan style pizza done right. Been here many times and it does not disappoint. Friendly staff and expedient service. 
On concert or event nights be aware that the wait can be longer than usual.
Another solid addition to an amazing downtown pizza scene."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza and  pasta. The food is well prepared    It was difficult to decide what we wanted to eat - everything is so fresh."}
{"text":"Killer pizza, was in town for business just around the corner from my hotel. Had the lasagna pizza... awesome!"}
{"text":"If anything, get the pizza. Margherita bufalo was good. Nice thin crust and very tasty.

Salad was meh, just dry arugula and a few pieces of shaved pecorino cheese. 

Italian soda is from the can.

Staff is really nice.

(I feel badly about negatively reviewing downtown businesses since I think it's so important for downtown Phoenix to thrive. I do have to say that the last time I went here was a few years ago, sat at the bar, and we saw SEVERAL cockroaches crawling ON THE TABLE. I even lifted up my plate and tried to smash one. Last night was cockroach free however so I think they fixed that situation...)"}
{"text":"Honestly, the best dining experience I have had in a while. Lights were dim, music was unbelievable and the pasta!! I will be here regularly, count on it."}
{"text":"It's great to see a place in downtown Phoenix that gets it! Great food, great service-we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great pizza with a super nice staff. I highly recommend starting with the Misto Tavola. The fresh mozzarella was great. We enjoyed the Italian Stallion the most out of the 5 pizzas we tried. Also, my sister was in with her family, which includes 3 boys between 8 and 2. The boys were pretty rambunctious, but the server was very accommodating even when one of the boys spilled his water all over the table."}
{"text":"3 pasta dishes. The amatraciana smelled sour- they seemed to try to mask it with copious amounts of salt; inedible. Puttenesca was so fishy that it was off putting. Pomodoro had no garlic. Only salvageable item was our focaccia appetizer & we skipped the heavily salted marinara; we opted for butter. Unfortunately this was a takeout order as we would have sent all the pasta dishes back."}
{"text":"Not only is the wood fired pizza delicious, but the service here is fantastic. Our waiter was friendly and helpful, the pizza is made quickly and the toppings are generous. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My family are regulars at La Piazza Al Forno in Glendale and whenever we get downtown we make sure we stop by to see Rachel or Justin!  We love love their pizza's.  The Italian Stallion is the bomb.  Great family owned restaurant and SO much better than Bianco ANY DAY!!!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty great. My daughter and I were looking for a nice spot to try and we definitely found it here. The staff was awesome and the food was fantastic. Pretty laid back atmosphere. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"If you like hair in your food, this is the place for you!  Food was ok.  If you like to pay $8 for a salad that is just arugula and olive oil and vinegar, just come to my place and I'll rip you off for half the cost.  Meat and cheese plate was good, pizza ok, but kind of soggy.  Service was terrible.  Apparently having hair in your food is not a big deal to this place.  Go to cibo or Pomo pizzeria for better service and food.  I wanted to like this place, so bummed they suck."}
{"text":"Great pizza at an excellent price for a wonderful cause. It was really quick service. I only had a few minutes and that's all it took."}
{"text":"Margarita pizza is great, Bianca pizza had no flavor. Pasta was delicious but the portions are way too small. The cannoli was not good. Service was great."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and salad. The server was very accommodating. Recommend this place for a group."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had...period. Great service and cool ambience. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Many reviewers here on Yelp seem to dole out 5-star reviews like candy on Halloween. However, I feel an establishment needs to really earn 5 stars, and rarely bestow such high ratings. 

To the owners of La Piazza Locale - you earned it!

Wow. Just freakin' WOW! I left your restaurant completely stuffed, and raving about your pie to whoever would listen to me for days! Thank God I don't live in AZ, or I'd be 450 pound regular in a matter of weeks.

I wish I could say I'll be back soon.

Order the pizza diavolo. You're welcome."}
{"text":"A fan of La Piazza in Glendale and being in Phoenix, I decided to dine at the \"sister\" restaurant.  Nice location, nice atmosphere.  Simple, clean decor.  The first thing I noted was that the menu is much smaller than the Glendale location.  No chicken marsala.. etc.  Ok, we accept that.  Decided to order Pizza margarita with prosciuito (extra charge).  Hubby ordered pasta puttanesca which was to include anchovies.  My pizza came out with very, very thin and scant prosciuitto.  I ordered this at the Glendale location and it was much more generous on the prosciutto.  I also recall seeing more basil on it.  It was good, but not the greatest.  The puttanesca was the star of the two dishes.  Garlicky red sauce with NOT an anchovy in sight.  The portion was small.  It was like being back in France where restaurants serve you like you are on a diet whether you want to be or not.  Flavorwise, I thought the sauce was good.  My husband's take was that the sauce was almost as good as mine (Thank you, darling).  Puttanesca sauce requires anchovies end of story and they were not there.  
Although it was happy hour, our server did not offer any happy hour drinks.  We had to ask and after we did, he put a menu on the table which looked like their regular drinks list.  When we asked, he said everything was on there.  Don't most restaurants highlight what is part of the happy hour and how much it is?   I think if we were prompted, we would have imbibed some of the offerings.  Management:  you may want to let people know what the happy hour offers.  Why  don't you try offering an appetizer of the day with a signature cocktail, wine and beer of the day.  MAKE US WANT IT is what I am saying l!!!   
Remember most of your customers are weak and waiting for an excuse to have a drink.  
Well,  all in all, this place does NOT compare to the Glendale location.  Those of you who are giving this place rave reviews, go to the Glendale location first and then we'll talk."}
{"text":"The wait staff was friendly and inviting.  The menu was super & offered a very nice variety of dishes, food was promptly delivered and was absolutely delicious! We had the barrata appetizer, a green salad (balsamic dressing excellent) pizza; crust fresh, buttery, like I would expect at a really good quality pizzeria, pasta was absolutely fresh & delicious, and we topped it off with a dessert of freshly cooked dough with drizzles of Nutella, this needed much more Nutella but otherwise delicious. Very reasonably priced!!!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza! Stopped in before a Suns game around 5PM (right when they open) so we were seated quickly. The waitress was really kind, and informative of the menu and beers (there is no fountain drinks or beers). We ordered the Italian Stallion, Dolce Diavolo, the Rocca, Pizza Fritte (Calzone), and I cannot remember the last pizza. But they were all so delicious, and you could really taste the fresh ingredients! Though, we all agreed the Dolce Diavolo was the best out of our pizzas! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Remember pizza is subjective people.  Different people from different parts will have different tastes.  We stopped by here for lunch today after visiting the team shop for the Suns.  We were fortunate to find a parking spot in front of the place too.  I ordered just a pepperoni pizza and it was really good.  The food taste so fresh.  Me and my coworker split a order of fried mozzarella also.  it was pretty good too.  I have eaten at the other place in Glendale and it is just as good too.  This location is closer for me coming from the house or the office.  The owner was really fun to talk too also.  I like this place and will recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Went with friends who regularly attend locale and they had nothing but great things to say about it. Got to meet Justin the owner and he recommended the Italian Stallion pizza which was incredible!!! Had a great experience. Justin is also a hip hop head so nothing but great beats coming through the speakers! Can't wait to go back and try more things!!"}
{"text":"Came here 12/26/17 between 6-7pm with a group of four. The rating of 4 1/2 stars is what drew our attention since you can rarely go wrong with that. 

1. We were not greeted but instead had to go get an employee to seat us. 
2. Never received drinks but were charged for them 
3. Had to get our own silverware 
4. Did not have anyone check on our table even once
5. We waited for about 20 minutes after finishing before asking for our check and they made it seem like an inconvenience

I've been using yelp for years and leave both great and negative reviews. In the restaurant business you need to be consistently great. 

I will also mention I was at this place with other people who use yelp and will leave similar reviews shortly. If you have any questions feel free to contact me through yelp. 

Every restaurant has a bad night, but you can't rock 4.5 stars and perform like you did today.

{"text":"Got the salciccia. The smoked cheese overwhelms the pizza. You can't taste anything else! 

I've been here before - the previous experience was much better."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in Phx metro area. If you want the good stuff this is where it's at. Little on the pricy side but worth every cent."}
{"text":"O mio Dio!! My friends know I don't like pizza, so believe me when I say this place is phenomenal. (My friends are also probably sick of this word.)

I was introduced to this place while looking for a place to dine while working Phoenix Comicon this year. My friend wanted pizza and I was too tired to argue with him. I'm so grateful I didn't. We were seated immediately and the server was very friendly and attentive.

My friend introduced me to burrata. It was a little ball of heaven. It melted in your mouth and was creamy. It came with speck (prosciutto) and Rob said it was delectable and perfect. I don't eat pork, so I'll take his word for it.  Following this was the quattro formaggio pizza. Oh sweet baby Jesus.... I loved it.

Then came the tiramisu. The owner's wife makes it daily from scratch. I've had my share of \"good\" tiramisu desserts that people raved about, but I could never fathom ever eating a second time. Hers was amazing. It is rich and the lady fingers are perfectly soaked with just enough of the coffee liqueur. The marscapone is creamy, smooth and layered equally. This is the only place I will eat this dessert now. Just delicious and a dance for my taste buds!

Since then, I've brought my sister, niece, son, mother, co-workers and friends to this place. They all love it. I've tried their burrata pizza, their regina margherita pizza and also the bianca. All of these are fantastic!!

I was finally brave enough to try calamari when one of my friends ordered it. Both my friend and my mother are extremely picky about calamari since it can be quite rubbery when not cooked right. Their calamari came out perfect. Not one bit was bad and the garlic and Italian chilies are very good with it. We were stabbing each others' hands with forks to get at the garlic.

Here's one thing that I found to set them apart from other restaurants. When I ordered the burrata and speck the last few times I was there, the server remembered that I do not eat pork, so he substituted artichokes and tomatoes so I could enjoy the entire appetizer. They didn't up-charge for the substitution like most places would.

For those with a nut allergy - Their pesto is made with almonds. It is not on the menu, so if you don't ask, you won't know."}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here. The mixed drink I had was great! Forget name but vodka and grapefruit juice. The pizza was not good. Ricotta was cold and undercooked on top but the crust on bottom was burnt and tasted awful. Would not go back again. I am sure there are other pizza places that have better pizza cooked correctly."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix hands down!!!!  True European style pizza - so nice of a change from the usual greasy pizza...  Will definitely be back! 

In addition to the Italian Stallion and Salciccia E Friarielle, we had the misto tavola with fresh baked focaccia bread - to die for!!!!

Alisha was great too!"}
{"text":"Taste of pizza excellent but it arrived lukewarm on the table and the dough was \"mushy\", wet and not cooked enough. Nice place with helpful waiters but  we came to taste the pizzas that were described as great by the Arizona Republic food critic. Too bad but we will not go back"}
{"text":"We had an hour before we had to be at a Rattler's game. I've been to the place across the street at least 20 times but I've never even noticed this place. My buddy had been here once before and recommended the pizza. 

The restaurant has a very 'urban' vibe. The server was very friendly but the service felt a little abrupt. 

I started out with a craft beer in a bottle. No taps here. And spent some time looking over the menu. All the pizzas looked unique and different. After going back and forth between two, I took the recommendation of the server and ordered the Dolce Diavolo. I was a little worried about the honey, but the slight sweetness balanced out the spice of the Calabrian Chilis.   The toppings were used sparingly and allowed for a different flavor profile with each bite. The basil was the perfect note to finish off the slightly charred flavor of the crust. 

I ended up getting the 'Sour Elder' as a cocktail and loved it!  I was expecting it to be sweeter than it was, but was pleasantly surprised at the sour notes that shone through."}
{"text":"Coming from New York, we're pretty fussy about pizza, and this place was one of the better spots we've found in the Valley. I'd call it better than Bianco, maybe on par with Grimaldis, but not quite as good as Pomo or Il Bosco (note this is not necessarily family consensus). Prices were reasonable and the service was prompt and pleasant and very friendly -- we were a little pressed for time before a comedy show, but had no problem making it on time. People seemed to be having a good time in this joint -- not a bad place to get ramped up for an evening downtown."}
{"text":"WOW!! I debated even writing a review. I don't want to share any of the limited number of seats!! I came here before a comedy show and was just driving around aimlessly looking on yelp at random places with good reviews. I sat right at the bar in front of the wood burning pizza oven, ordered the Italian stallion (don't forget to ask for basil and oregano!!) and a glass of wine. The pizza was incredible!!!! The sauce tastes just like my Italian grandfather taught me to make. The crust was devoured and even ate all the little meat crumbles off the plate. The servers were all very nice even with it being so busy on a Saturday night. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The real deal , delicious pie and perfectly cooked. The crust /dough is one of the best I've had and along with all the quality ingredients makes a great pizza."}
{"text":"I'm was in the area and wanted pizza. So we decided to stop in based on the reviews. 

The spot was pretty cute and cozy. They make personalized sized pizzas. About 6 good slices. Everyone's pizza looked good and we all placed an order. I wasn't impressed at all. The sauce had a funky taste to it that I couldn't really get into and I love pizza. I got the Montanara, where they flash the crust then they cook it. The crust was really delish. But I ended up unable to finish the one slice. 

Our service was kinda slow which made no sense because they weren't that busy. The tap water is horrid. Don't get it. Lol. All the drinks come in a bottle...a very large one I might add. 

The price per pizza was a bit pricey for the size $10-$16. And the bottle drinks were almost $4. 

Overall, it's safe to say that I did not like the food and even though the service was slow, the people were nice."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic, very friendly service, and super delicious! A true gem of a place has opened its doors to the diners of downtown Phoenix. Go here NOW!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Great pizza. Amazing crust and flavor. But what makes this place even more enjoyable is the staff!  The servers and cooks are very kind, considerate and just great service. They were humbly nice people grateful for its customers. Will return again definitely. Highly recommend it!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I enjoyed it.  I ordered the white pizza and it was pretty decent.  The dough they use is delicious.  If I'm not throwing away your crust, your restaurant is doing something right.  The different cheeses used were delicious, but I have to say it wasn't as flavorful as other white pizzas I've had.  Maybe add a little more garlic or some sort of drizzle (think pesto or balsamic).  They serve Coke in a glass bottle (my favorite kind with real cane sugar).

The service was average at best.  I love going places that have exceptional service, so this fact might stop me from being a regular here.  It's not a very big place, so I was disappointed in the limited interaction we had with our server.

I'll most likely go back again and hope the next dish I try is out of this world and that my server is more friendly."}
{"text":"I'm from San Francisco, and this $30 meal would easily be $50-$60 in north beach. We had the locale salad, margarita pizza, and pomodo pasta. I would give the meal 5 stars and our server was not only attentive but super sweet. They were closing and they let us finish our meal and take our time. If I'm ever back on the Phoenix area I would 100% recommend this place. It was honestly some of the best Italian food I've had in quite some time."}
{"text":"\"My Death Row Meal\". Since my 2016 review, I have been back 5 or so times.  On Saturday, We returned for our favorite pizza.  We were lucky to get a parking spot right out front and the friendliest (and handsome) server.  This time, we tried the Misto Tavola appetizer.  It was almost too beautiful to eat.  

Then it was time for pizza. After the first of six slices, my sweetie said that La Piazza's Italian Stallion pizza would be his last meal request if on death row.  It IS that good!"}
{"text":"Eating their pizza was like a taste of home - that being Italy. I haven't had Neapolitan pizza that delicious since I was in Italy. The prosciutto and mozzarella panino was equally as delicious. Will definitely go back before we leave town!"}
{"text":"This restaurant, in a comfortable, relaxed setting, serves some of the best Neapolitan pizza I have had the joy of eating!  The crust was delicate, crisp and flavorful, not like some cardboard crusts.  The toppings were fresh and richly flavored.  The house made motzarella cheese was amazing!  Service was quick and friendly, prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our visit and our food ... can't wait to come back!  I had the Carbonara (weakness for me) as I was going to have Pizza originally.  Great flavor and portion size.  Wife had the Marinara and loved it too (added sausage to hers)."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! We ordered the Italian Stallion for my husband and I and a pepperoni pizza for my stepdaughter. She ate 4 slices which is unheard of and both pizzas were demolished. The service was fantastic and the experience was amazing!"}
{"text":"Excuse my Italian... But HolyShit! This was the best damn pizza I have ever eaten! We also had this cheese meat plate I don't think is on the menu but the (buff guy) as the waiter calls the owner blessed us with was out freaking standing! My taste buds were in heaven... the Italian heaven where Jesus is... anyway can't go wrong here! 
TRUST in Piazza!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best pizza joints I have been to! Great customer service, Justin is awesome! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was an interesting restaurant! We had never been to an Italian restaurant that played hard rock, but we enjoyed the music. The food was good and they had an abundance of pizza options with different sauces. They were accommodating on my vegetarian requests. I would eat here if I lived in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Their food here is really good. Pizza is the best I have had in Phoenix. However, this restaurant couldn't care less regarding the comfort of their customers in here. There was a large gangster group of people dining here tonight. Walking in loudly and not once simmering down until their food came. The chattiness of the group wasn't the issue tho, as many places have that loud table. The large group found the restaurant's choice of music playing not their taste and proceeded to blast (yes blast on a fucking speaker they brought in) their ghetto rap music for the whole restaurant to hear. There were two couples and a few single diners there with me, who looked with disgust to this group's lack of manners. This by no means was an offense to the restaurant. But how the waitress working tonight handled the situation I was utterly befuddled! The music blasted for a good 10 mins before I proceeded out of the restaurant. How long it continued I do not know. But the whole duration I was there I witnessed the waitress apologizing to each table she went to and then sing along with two of the songs being blasted over the music that was already playing in the background! Not only did she not ask them to at least turn it down, but she was joining in on the party. It sounded like a fucking nightclub in there. An older man walked up and then out during this time, I'm assuming because of the loud gangster rap. I don't know... Maybe the waitress was friends with these people. As she proceeded to take several pictures for the group and did not once acknowledge the fact that 1) the music was completely inappropriate for a public restaurant and 2) was so loud no conversation could have been had. I dine out a lot and I can honestly say that I have never been in a restaurant setting where a situation like this could have been handled more poorly. I will be taking my business to the Glendale location instead until they hire a staff that has more respect and manners for their customers."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  Delicious crust and fresh toppings.  Great service - even during busy times.  Extensive beer and wine list.  Close to convention center."}
{"text":"La Piazza PHX is an easy to miss, small restaurant tucked away in downtown. I just didn't find it to be 4.5 stars on Yelp good. The restaurant had the UFC fight on with the volume turned up and nothing else on, which set a weird ambiance seeing as how it's not a sports bar. Service was okay. We ordered an appetizer, salad, and pizza to share between two of us. 

The fried mozzarella was okay - I was expecting something novel from the menu description (house made mozzarella) but what came out looked and tasted like normal fried mozzarella sticks from the freezer. My arugula salad was fine, it came out dressed though I ordered it dressing on the side which took some time to get someone's attention to fix. No big deal though. The Margherita pizza was pretty good, a little burnt on some parts but the sauce and cheese were quite good. It was a fine meal, but not very memorable or one of my favorite pizzas in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Slowly becoming a big fan of this place.

I am already a fan of Pomo Pizzaria, just up the street for La Piazza Locale.

Yes, this is the smae style of Pizza as Pomo, Cibo, Federal and la bianca (though not as gourmet as the last two),

Good solid Napoli pizza (thin quick cooked, a bit soupy at times).

There are special pizzas every week, ask your waitress or waiter.

Great crust, pizza made to order.  

The woom is a bit dark and simple, but good pizza."}
{"text":"My husband and I were attending a concert at Comerica Theater, and wanted to grab dinner nearby beforehand. I've read a few write-ups about this restaurant, and decided to give it a shot. Our go-to Neapolitan pizza restaurant is usually Pomo, but after eating here La Piazza Locale has stolen that prize.

After being seated our server explained to us that they have draft cocktails. He described the cocktails in detail, and then offered samples if we would like. I sampled the Italian Margarita and the Lost Leaf. They Lost Leaf was quite good, and I liked it much better than the other one, so that was my drink of choice. For our entrees we chose the burrata pizza and the carbonara pasta.

The pizza came out super fast, as typical neopolitan pizza is cooked quickly. The pizza was parallel with the pizza we've had in Florence. The sauce was perfect, just the right amount of sweetness, but not overly sweet. The burrata was smooth and creamy, the basil was fresh, and the crust was cooked perfectly. Our carbonara came out a little later, it also was quite good. It had a rich cream sauce with egg, guanciale, peas, and pecorino. The crushed black pepper added a nice bite. We were offered dessert of tiramisu which was made that day. This was also fantastic, with rich layers of mascarpone and liquor soaked lady fingers. After a great experience here, we can't wait to return and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"5 for the food but 2-3 for the service. Delicious! Nice fresh and simple salads and the pizza is so tasty. I recommend the pizze Bianca! Service was a pretty slow and the waitress was kind of rude about splitting our check, however."}
{"text":"I love these guys! Pizza is wonderful, owners are very community oriented. The owner shared on my last visit that the new parking meter rules downtown actually make visiting easier as US Airways event owners can no longer tie up spaces for the night. So if that kept you from stopping in...give it another shot! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am in love with the La Piazza  mozzarella sticks, calzones, and pizza were perfect!!!"}
{"text":"So I have had all the local pizza places (Pomo, Bianco, etc.) and this by far is my favorite. Dolce Diavolo hands down best pizza ever! Chilies and honey on top! The best!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but it really fell short. I had the montanara pizza which was soggy and was topped with only 2 pieces a basil. I only ate the crust. We had made reservations and were told that we could have a discount as parking is not provided (nice surprise!) We mentioned the promised discount when the check arrived, but our young waitress had great difficulty figuring it out.  We reminded her that the check would also need spit two ways and when that happened the discount disappeared. She told us that we just couldn't see the discount... sure lady we couldn't see it because it was no longer there. Not a big deal as the discount was just a nice surprise, but she should have had integrity to ask for help. 
I do plan on giving this place another try, and hopefully I will have a better experience."}
{"text":"Everything about our dinner here was perfect. The waiter was super nice and friendly. The food was absolutely delicious and I really enjoyed the imported beer selection. Thanks for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Came back here on a night where the owner Justin Piazza was putting part of their profits to work for their upcoming re-branding.  They are changing their name from La Piazza Locale to La Piazza PHX effective 9/1/2014.  Apparently Chipotle (yes, that Chipotle) is opening a chain of pizzerias called Pizzeria Locale nationwide and sued Justin to change his restaurant's name.  Not wanting to go broke fighting a corporate titan, they instead opted to re-brand.  While La Piazza isn't my favorite of the Downtown Phoenix pizzerias, its still great and more than worthy of support.

The place was much busier than my last visit.  This despite the fact that there were no sporting events or concerts this night.  Justin himself was manning the pizza oven and the restaurant was pretty close to full when I arrived.  I just came by myself this time.  They have a tiny bar area near the oven, but I opted for a small corner table instead.  This time I went with arguably their best and most popular pie, the Italian Stallion.  Four meats (sausage, pepperoni, cotto, and sopressata) on top of house-made mozzarella and San Marzano tomato sauce.  Its a pretty manly dish.  I've had this pizza before at their location in Glendale, but tonight it was especially awesome.  The meats were cooked perfectly and the crust was spot on.  This is the first time Justin himself has made me a pie so I'm guessing that made the difference.

Looking around the restaurant its pretty clear there are quite a few regulars as Justin and his wife were hugging and shaking hands with a lot of the patrons.  The wait staff is super friendly and laid back just as they were last time I was here.  The setup here is still a little bit quirky (particularly the bar area), but it seems like they're coming into their own.  I would still rank this 4th on my list of Downtown Phoenix Pizzerias (behind Pomo, Cibo, and Bianco), but the product and the pace of business is definitely improving.  Their name may change, but as long as Justin is making the pies, my enthusiasm for his pizzerias will remain the same."}
{"text":"I would give the pizza here four stars but everything else 1. Save your time and money and go to any of a number of other pizza joints nearby. Cibo is my favorite but there is also Pomo and nook. 
Service- waiter hovered and repeatedly came over to ask for food and drink orders when we weren't ready. Which is fine, he was nice about it when we weren't ready. But after we ordered, the guy was nowhere to be seen. Needed napkins, a straw, chili flakes, more wine. None of that was attended to. 
Food- we ordered the \"lasagna\" pizza which was good. Not great but good. And we also tried to order the carbonara pasta but they were out of peas (on a Friday in season) so we went with the pesto pasta. My husband makes homemade pasta and I make a decent pesto. We also eat out, a lot. To our disappointment this pesto pasta was the worst we'd ever had. So so so oily!!! See photo and that's after I mopped up half the oil. It was like they made the pesto earlier and then reheated it. And when we told our server, see above. He tried to tell us all pesto was oily and acted like we didn't know what pesto was. From that point forward he was attitude City. I understand if management doesn't allow comped dishes that suck but no need to be rude. We weren't expecting a comped meal but we were expecting at a minimum, acknowledgement. 
Finally- their wine pours suck. For $10-12 a glass I'd expect more than five sips."}
{"text":"I would recommend having lunch here!!

The margarita pizza (with house-made mozzarella) was really good! The red sauce was great and it had just enough cheese! 

The soda comes in cans/bottles which is interesting..."}
{"text":"Wow, wow and wow. As I walked into this dope little spot that was jamming out to Jay-Z I just knew....it may be true love. I was greeted promptly and happily by Matteo, who was also my server. I sat at the little bar area and ordered a beer and hung out while browsing over the menu. I was going stag that night, and everyone was super friendly! Not in the manner of \"wow this chick probably has no friends, what a loser\" type fake friendly....but genuinely super cool, including the owner who was manning the oven. 

It finally came time to order some food, so I decided to go with the Pizza Special, the Tricolore. It was perfect because I couldn't decide on just one pizza, and this pizza was split into three different sections. I added some anchovies to one part and wow. Took the first bite and wanted to punch someone in the face because of how good it was. The cheese, you could tell was fresh and made in house. The crust was the perfect amount of crispy and soft and all the ingredients were great. I also saved room for a cannoli and couldn't be happier with how good THAT was. Just the right amount of sweet, perfect crunch of the shell, none of the extra added BS like chocolate shit drizzled for no apparent reason. 

I'll definitely be coming back and bringing more people. Thanks La Piazza."}
{"text":"Having opened just a few weeks ago, La Piazza Locale brings the 2nd VPN-certified Neapolitan pizza to downtown Phoenix.  The first thing I thought when I found this place was, \"What, don't we have enough excellent pies downtown?\"

But we had to try it anyways.

My friend went with Rocco, and I went with the special of the day Don Matteo (smoked butternut squash puree as the sauce, with speck and mozarella).

My first observation was that the crust had the soupiness that a real Napoletana pizza should have.  The crust was perfect.  This is knife-and-fork pizza, and if you think their crust is too soggy, you're wrong.

The smoked butternut was phenomenal.  I'm not sure that's a real authentic ingredient for Neapolitan pizza, but it was probably one of the top three pies I have ever eaten.

My friend's Rocco was pretty good, too, but the Don Matteo was definitely at a whole different level.

My only real complaint about this place was that the music was a little too loud and too trendy.  When dining, I don't like it when the music is too noticeable.  I usually prefer restaurants not to be too trendy, but everything else about the restaurant was great, so I can let this pass.

Locale is now on my short list of best pies in the Valley.  It's not as good as Bianco, but it's top tier."}
{"text":"The locale was clean & the staff was phenomenal & welcoming.  Pizza was good but could have been better. The place was crowded b/c it was the first night of the U2 concert."}
{"text":"THE BEST ITALIAN FOOD YOU WILL EVER EAT!! The staff is super cool and can help you pronounce the names of the dishes ! I would book a flight with a long layover just to stop here and eat!! They know my wife and I and we really feel like family when we come in!"}
{"text":"So glad to have found this gem! Authentic Italian, amazing wood fired pizza, & great local business."}
{"text":"Service was good. The food was barely worthy of eating. The ingredients seemed fresh and the makings of a good pizza are there, but the execution by the kitchen staff was abysmal and sloppy. The ratio of ingredients was off with too little cheese and too much sauce on a soggy crust (that wasn't at all crusty). It was like eating bread and pizza sauce. The kitchen staff were also very unprofessional. He didn't wash his hand before making food after hanging out talking on the phone and filling out paperwork in the dining area. There was a stray meatball on my non-meat pizza further showing the sloppiness of the kitchen staff. Will not return."}
{"text":"La Piazza PHX is absolutely a solid Four Star experience. 

We've been here many times for the pizza/ pasta and found it exceptionally good. Our benchmark for these wood fired Neapolitan places is the original Pomodoro on Scottsdale Road before they moved.  

As the photo shows, they've earned the Verace Neapoletana Certificate and we can attest to its yummy goodness. 

We've tried most things on the menu, from the pastas, to almost all the pizzas(photo) and desserts.  We really haven't found anything that we would give less than Four Stars to. They're just solid. 

About a year and a half ago Guy Fieri came through town and liked what he saw. On your way out you'll notice the DDD poster and his signature attached. 

Now we've learned, that this isn't always a good housekeeping seal of approval, since he also likes Dives. But the food at la Piazza is good and we always come back whenever we're in downtown PHX. So enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is SO GOOD. I love eating here. The first time I came here, I was surprised at how fast the service was for how good the food is. (Usually food quality degrades depending on how fast it gets to you, but they were really fast AND really delicious!) I suggest the carbonara. YUMMY!!!!!"}
{"text":"I got takeout from here for my girlfriend and I and it was underwhelming at best.  First, after seeing two very different pictures for the regular Margherita pizza and the Regina Margherita DOC, I was told the only difference was that one had buffalo cheese.  We also got the pesto pasta, which tasted more of pine nuts than pesto.  And finally, we had a cannoli for desert and it was dreadful.  I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking to be blown away, or even moderately impressed."}
{"text":"I don't leave many reviews but I would be completely wrong if I didn't leave one for this place. Absolutely THE best pizza experience I have ever had!! Truly legit Napoli style pizza! And that come Aron a group of guys who spent 4-5 years in Naples! If you're near this place, GO!!!"}
{"text":"Great new addition to downtown Phoenix, but not quite as good as Bianco or Pomo!  I think downtown Phoenix is becoming a hotbed for amazing, authentic pizza and this addition helps solidify that!

Good location, friendly staff, quick service and tasty pizza.  The margherita pizza was good...sweet but still savory!"}
{"text":"Authentic brick oven pizza with a San Marzano tomato sauce is what sold me on their margherita pizza. It did taste as great as the menu described it! I'm definitely looking forward to getting into my leftovers later...

On their beverage menu, an Italian soda with an assortment of flavors was listed. I was a little bummed that I was brought a canned Sanpelligrino; definitely not what I expected, but still good nonetheless."}
{"text":"After reading about this place in The Wall Street Journal I had to stop by. Based on \"Authentic Napoletana\" pizza, it was a target on my list. With that being said, I have never been to Italy. 
     But the food was really amazing for the price. I Spent 35 bucks and had an 3 course meal of high quality tasty food.  
      However, I am a stickler for service. Even though I did not see anyone wait very long to get seated (self included), It took 5 minutes to get acknowledged for a drink - and I sat at the bar. Followed by me flagging servers down to take my order plus asking the owners wife for a utensils and my napkin. 
      Bless the owner and his wife. He is busting his butt cooking for quality and trying to keeps things moving and his wife was very nice and tried to do the same. 
      Rare is it that I would consider going somewhere again with bad service. But - I under stood the issue, not the food, location, price, quality of restaurant - but staff. I will come again. lol."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I will NOT give this place a try! HAIR in food! That's the worst. It ruins the whole experience."}
{"text":"Maybe we came to this restaurant at an in-oportune time. There was definitely a packed house in this rather small pizza restaurant. 

Server seemed very friendly, but the attention was lacking.  We had to ask multiple times for parts of our order.

Ordered the calamari for appetizer- it was average. 
Ordered the Italian Stallion Pizza. Serving portion was pretty large.  It was pretty descent but not as good as expected.
The best part of the meal in my opinion was the dark green salad, which was very fresh and the dressing was excellent.

For the price, I would expect more. The waitress was very very nice but did not pay enough attention to our order or detail."}
{"text":"Pizza & pasta are all amazing. Lived in Italy for 4 years so I'm pretty picky when it comes to pizza. Their pizza tastes just like authentic Italian pizza!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while on a layover in Downtown Phoenix. Atmosphere is pleasant and centrally located. My waitress seemed preoccupied and not very attentive. I inquired about an item on the menu and she didn't really sell the pizza. I was never offered any water until after my meal. Soft drink was brought out to me in a large soda bottle. No glass or ice. I had to ask for that too. After I paid my check I was brought only one copy (store copy) of the receipt. I asked for my copy and she told me it was a new system, so no copy for me. Really? That goes against every customer rule I've ever heard of. So I took a picture of my receipt instead. I should follow up with the owner but didn't have time this evening. The pizza was good and tasty but this place needs to close the loop on their customer skills. I can't recommend this place due to mediocre bordering bad customer service."}
{"text":"I did a take out lunch order for my first visit. I will certainly be back to enjoy the decor and atmosphere.  I had the tomato e mozzerella Panino- lunch special. It was delicious and a great lunch (as I had left overs) for $7.  
If you love brick oven - wood fired pizza, go to this place."}
{"text":"I am a super fan of any pizza place that has the Verace Pizze Napoletana Associazione , VPN, seal from Italy. CERTIFIED! This was one pizza place near us that we had not tried so on a Friday we found ourselves here. I was surprised that they were not very busy and the hostess gave us a slight attitude when we asked to be seated at a small table against the wall rather than near the door. Our waiter however was completely on his game. He was helpful and super patient as we generally take a good twenty minutes drinking our drinks and catching up and barely looking at the menu in front of us.. YES. We are that annoying couple who works a lot and meals out are for catching up sometimes. We were served waters and our drinks, bubbly Prosecco for me and an Italian beer for my husband, almost immediately. For you cocktail types, there are a few on the menu, but mainly you will find beer and wines here. Some great ones, I might add! Next door is the Kettle Black though, when you are done with your meal, if you are feeling like you need more libation! We love great calamari and we just had a feeling based on Yelp reviews that La Piazza would not disappoint us with their version.. They did not. This is the best calamari I have had in all of the desert. The calamari is crisp and spicy with calabrian chiles and and garlic and the chile sauce is to die for. I could have made this my entire meal! BUT fear not, Kimberly will get her pizza pie! We ordered the Italian Stallion.. Oh my. This Italian Stallion comes laden with lots of amazing-ness: The local Schreiners Sausage; Pepperoni; Prosciutto (cotto) and Sopresatta, and then San Marzano tomatoes and mozzarella to perfect this stallion of a pie. Your mouth thanks you when you take your first bite. We also ordered The Blanca and added Sopresatta too. So tasty .. i loved this white pizza and the ricotta combined with EVOO and mozzarella.The crust is crisp from the wood fired oven and you know that VPN seal has been earned for a reason! There are many things on the menu at La Piazza that look so tasty that deciding on what pizza to get was a challenge. A good one! There are fresh salads , calzone, paninis, lots of antipasti, and desserts. Our dessert on this particular night was a house made Limoncello. It was not the best I have had and unlike the 'other' amazing VPN certified pizza place in PHX, you will pay for it as its not gratis. But it was still sweet and nice to try! La Piazza is a perfect location for finishing dinner and having a night cap somewhere in the vicinity of CityScape or again, Kettle Black next door. Another great wood fired pizza place in PHX to add to my list of pie greatness!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow.    Exceptional service and over the top good food.   As a guy who grew up in Italy (summers) this is THE most authentic Italian pizza I have had on this side of the pond.   Host, waiter, and Matteo (from Italy within the past two years) were so genuine and warm.     We had the Rocco and it was amazing.    The Nutella dessert was incredible."}
{"text":"Man my panini, salad and pizza were great! They were under staffed but it was a week day and I was in town for a conference. The food and ambiance were great! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Love this pizza place! The \"Dolce Diavolo\" pizza is the bomb! It has arizona honey and it's amazing. Can't get enough of it. My girlfriend and I also get meat and cheese board. It's just super good as well. The Mexican Coke always hits the spot with our meals. I love coming to this place. Also they play good music, I like the way they throw \"MANA\" on there lol always like coming here and will always recommend people."}
{"text":"Pizza is good but cheap on the cheese and basil. Also why does this show up on craft beer search when no options really for that. Fail"}
{"text":"Walked by this restaurant and decided to give it a try.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I tried the fresh mozzarella appetizer.  It was lightly breaded, fried and served with a marinara sauce.  I ordered the spinach salad, which turned out to be one of the best I'd ever had!  It was full of spinach, goat cheese, bacon and a tasty dressing.  Very hearty size too!  If I'm ever back in Phoenix, I'd definitely go back for that salad!
If you want soda, just know that it's served in cans."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal. We did takeout one night and it held up well also."}
{"text":"Excellent wood fired pizza, pasta, salad, appetizers, etc. Incredible service. I was in town for a convention and the guy working was the host, waiter, bus boy, and ran the cash register. Very impressive."}
{"text":"There are a few pizza places here so  I have a ton of choices...this one is ahhmazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my time at La Piazza PHX. 

   Food: we ordered the Regina Margherita DOC pizza as well as the Rucola salad topped with Prosciutto. Pizza was absolutely delicious and perfectly sized for sharing (also could have easily eaten one to myself). Flavors were simple & delicious. The only thing I would have changed was the crust, which seemed a tiny bit underdone towards the middle--still tasted excellent!

   Service: was quick & friendly! Our waitress was knowledgeable and helpful when we were trying to decide!

   Ambiance: I loved that the restaurant was not too dark and didn't play the music too loudly, it allowed for easy conversation without shouting over the background. 

      Would absolutely return to try some more dishes!"}
{"text":"First off the glasses are cold enough to give me some ice in my beer.  Always a plus for me.  The selection of pizza was excellent and the wood fired  crust was even. The edge of the crust had just enough doughiness."}
{"text":"This is seriously the best pizza I have had anywhere during my entire life. It is utterly delicious. The location is great, right downtown near all of the sports arenas. It is a perfect spot to grab a bite to eat before a game or a show. It has a great atmosphere and very nice and informative staff. We have had the margharita and Italian Stallion, both were amazing and cooked perfectly in their brick oven. One of my absolute favorite things here are their desserts. I have heard that their house made tirimisu is amazing, but we tend to eat late and it has been sold out. So we have had their house made cheesecake each time and it is the best cheesecake I have ever had. I highly recommend everything about this place. A must hit in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This place was great!  We came in on a Friday evening and were able to sit down right away.  Mateo was our server.  He knew the menu well and seemed to like everything on it.  After some deliberation, my wife and I ordered.  She had the pizza burrata and a grapefruit cocktail that was really good.  I had the Ragu Nepoletano.  The pizza crust was PERFECT!  Seriously, it had just the right consistency and the smell and flavor were spot-on.  The combination of fresh tomato sauce and cheese was excellent.  My Ragu could not have been better.  It had a combination of beef, pork and sausage.  The meats were tender but not over cooked.  The pasta was al dente and it was baked with mozzarella on top.  Very tasty.  
Mateo, our server was attentive but laid back and ambiance was comfortable.  I recommend this place for anyone staying downtown in Phoenix.  I will be here for two more days and I plan to go again."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for dinner while in town for work. Wasn't very busy and got seated right away. Ordered a Divaolo without the meat and it was decent. I had wanted to try the combination of the chiles and the honey but to be honest it just didn't work for me. The pizza was fresh and the ingredients were very solid but just the combination didn't work for me. Service was friendly and the pizza is definitely on the pricier side but still not bad. Will return here again but might just stick to the margherita."}
{"text":"Have you ever eaten at Pomo? Cibo? Bianco?  If yes, then you know what to expect of this neapolitan-style pizza.  It's delicious, super thin, and yes, a little soupy (as it's supposed to be). 

In my own humble opinion, the two winners for this type of pizza in Phoenix are Piazza and Pomo.  They are very similar, and even have a similar ambiance.  Piazza is located more downtown, whereas Pomo is in the Roosevelt district.  

My boyfriend and I ate there on a Friday night.  We went in around 7:30, and were seated immediately.  We started off with two of their signature cocktails. By the end of the night I had tasted three out of four, and let me tell you....FANTASTIC!!!!! Especially the bourbon-based drink, nice and tangy. 

We ordered the calamari and mozzarella appetizers. The calamari was very lightly breaded, and cooked perfectly.  I find that many restaurants tend to over-cook, and the calamari ends up chewy and rubbery.  This was absolutely perfect.  The mozzarella was great, although I'm not a huge fan of fried mozzarella,  but for what it was, it was yum.  Both appetizers were served with their tomato pizza sauce for dipping.  It's a traditional pizza sauce, best described as watery and runny (again, that's how it's supposed to be).  SO GOOD.  

We ordered the margarita pizza, because I like to judge restaurants based on how well they do the simple stuff, before getting all fancy. The pizza came out perfectly, nice and hot, with chewy crust and melty cheese. Seriously, this pizza is amazing.

The staff is awesome, very attentive and friendly, with great suggestions.  We chatted with the owner, who liked us enough to send over a complementary slice of their ricotta cheesecake.  Now, I usually hate cheesecake.  It's too rich and dense for me.  This cheesecake couldn't be more different from the usually Cheesecake Factory heart attack on a plate that you usually see.  It was very light and fluffy, with a hint of lemon and drizzled with honey, perfect complements to the tang of the cheese. 

In all, fabulous pizza, fabulous people.  Definitely going to be going back there.  The nice part about it is...They are closed on Sunday, whereas Pomo is closed on Monday.  Now we can get great pizza seven days a week!"}
{"text":"Tried this place after reading yelp reviews and we are thankful we did. Staff were helpful and welcoming, service prompt even with a full restaurant. Pizza with fresh made ingredients and Italian tomatoes was beyond delicious. Will definitely return. Do yourself a favor and try this local place. Top notch."}
{"text":"First time coming into this location and it surpassed my expectations.  Great place for a lunch appointment.  Service was quick and the food was terrific.

We ordered the Dolce Diavolo and Italian Stallion.  Chilies and honey on a pizza?  Are you nuts?  But it works so well.  The problem with most all meat pizzas is they're too heavy and too greasey, but not the Italian Stallion.  Great meat but without  the grease."}
{"text":"I travel to Phoenix on business often. This place has excellent service, Rachel, and excellent food. I was here June 7, 2016 and ordered the Amartriciana. Wow, was this simple dish full of flavor! The sauce was simply amazing and should be their 'go to' dish. I liked it so much I came back June 29 and ordered the same thing...same result...amazing flavor.

Their tiramisu is outstanding as well.

This is a good family restaurant that has their ingredients and pizza oven imported from Italy. You can taste the difference in these authentic ingredients.

I will always return to this place and eventually try their awesome looking pizza.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have ever had and try to go anytime I'm at a Suns game, concert or even passing near downtown. Matter of fact, I plan my day or night around being able to eat here. The Italian Stallion (meat pizza) is unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Had the Italian Stallion pizza. It was very good and took about 2 minutes to arrive at my table after ordering. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"We visited La Piazza for lunch on a visit to Phoenix. We ordered three pizzas, the Bianco, Italian Stallion, and cheese pizza for the kiddos(Margherite minus the basil). The pizza had a nice charred crust and was flavorful. 

The Bianco needed salt, which was a surprise; however, I prefer more salt on my pizza than most.

We also had the warm spinach salad, which was very tasty.

I would come back here, I can appreciate real wood fired pizza, which is miles better than those \"fast fired\" pizzas at those popular chain pizza joints."}
{"text":"You need to eat here, you have to. La piazza is absolutely incredible. Their pizzas, appetizers, desserts - all of it. 

I've been to plenty of Italian restaurants around Phoenix, and until I had La Piazza, The Parlor was my favorite. The next part may sound ridiculous to you, but the moment I bit into a slice of the Diabolo, I was hooked.

Seriously, I couldn't believe how good it was! I couldn't believe I could be surprised by pizza, an item I've had millions of times, but not like this one.

The dough, incredible. It tastes fresh, like my grandmother hand rolled it in the back there. The sauce, amazing. You could taste each ingredient in it and it was as fresh as picking a tomato and taking a bite right out of it.

I don't know what else to say, other than the food is phenomenal. I recommend this place to EVERYONE. My friends are probably getting tired of me talking about it lol but it's something you have to experience. Do it."}
{"text":"We totally enjoyed our dining experience.  From the moment we walked in the door, we were made to feel special.  Everything was delicious from the wine, salad and of course, Matteo's masterful pizzas. Bravo!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in the valley!  Everything is really good, pizza/pasta/appetizers.  Their red sauce is my favorite, their crust is delicious and the toppings are very high quality.  My preference is always pizza, but for those that prefer pastas you will not be disappointed.  The Angioletta Fritti is amazing, fried pizza dough with a little marinara...amazing!  I definitely don't come here enough."}
{"text":"Possibly some the of most fresh ingredients I've ever had on a pizza! I literally watched them shave the meat. The sauce tasted like mouth watering vine ripe tomatoes with fresh herbs and spices. Fresh is so incredibly important when going out to eat and this place did it just right! The service was OUTSTANDING! Our server John even had such a wonderful Italian accent when pronouncing the true to Italian specials :) the cook came by more than once to ask how we liked our pizza! The atmosphere was comfortable, neatly decorated and not to big. I highly recommend brick oven pizza from this place if you are in downtown. Hands down the best pizza I have had in a long time! A+++ for the service and fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza I have ever had and that includes the pizza in NY!  The service is fast and friendly and the atmosphere is wonderful.  Great cocktails too!  I will be going there often!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Great atmosphere and amazing pizza! By far best pizza in Arizona. If u haven't eaten here ur missing out!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've had plenty of pizza in my life but I have to say that this is the best pizza there is! My favorites are the Italian Stallion & The Dolce Diavolo, but you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Had an incredible lunch from this 4 star gem. La Piazza PHX downtown served one of the tastiest authentic Italian cuisines I've ever had! It was a piece of Heaven!

Antipasti - Angiostatin Fritti:
\"00\" Bread Sticks, Sicilian Oregano, Imported Pomodorini Tomatoes, Sicilian Sea Salt, Shaved Parmesan, Basil

Panino (Sandwich) - Capo:
Prosciutto (Crudo), Pepperoni, Salami, House-Made Mozzarella, Mixed Greens, Sicilian Oregano, Extra Virgin Olive Oil

Dolci (Dessert) - Home-Made Cannoli"}
{"text":"Wow, this place... walked here from the convention center and am so happy I found it. Had 8 people in my party and every single person got amazing food. Great service, too, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. I'm incredibly picky with pasta, but I gotta say this pasta is really good! I never like restaurant pasta, no matter where I go, but i liked it here! More than my pizza actually! The salad was delicious and perfect to start. Ha! As far as drinks, nothing stood out, not even the wine. No worries, sometimes I love enjoying dinner without a drink and going somewhere after instead! We sat at the bar, our waitress was sweet who always made sure we were taken care of. Occasionally, another waiter would come over and he would double check on us too, which was really nice. It seems like they all work very hard and independently - which I personally love! Sometimes I hate when it's TOO friendly and work ends up slacking because of its looseness that usually follows with that, but not here! For as much as I've gone to Hanny's (across the street) I'm surprised it took me so long to come here! Will definitely come back and I look forward to trying the cannoli next time!"}
{"text":"I was left speechless..... What more could you ask for in a  pizza that cooks in a minute AND is perfected in its taste and ingredients. We split two pizzas, the Italian Stallion and the Dolce Diavolo (which comes with Sopressata, Calabrian Chiles, Fresh Basil and Honey) crazy combo but totally works! 
I equally loved both pizzas so much and killed almost two whole ones by myself (the other couple that came with us couldn't finish all their and I gladly helped.) Like other reviewers, the crust was perfectly charred and the only thing I could compare it to was a marshmallow. When you roast marshmallows and make that perfect one that has that golden brown char on the outside and it's cooked just enough on the inside to where it's creamy and tender... Thats what this crust is like! Best pizza I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I prefer this place for dinner to lunch.  At lunch it seems hectic and I want to be able to savor my pie.  At lunch too I find the pastas saltier than they are in the evening, and can't have a glass of wine to enjoy.  The pizza's have a great amount of char and for those who like a more tarte tomato sauce this place is for you.  They take their pizza seriously and have the awards to back it up.  The best starter and can't miss is the burrata.  Creamy, served with charred bread it makes for a lovely carb laden starter.  The pizza's come out super fast and I can't say enough how this is a great place to grab a bite before a show downtown.  The portions are not huge which is good, then you don't feel guilty about leaving the leftovers in your car while you catch the concert.  But I never feel like I'm leaving hungry.  Pretty solid overall."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. I've had the Burrato and Quattro stagioni as well as the calamari. Although the Burrato was delicious, the middle was quite soggy and I might have found 3 basil leaves if that. 

The other two dishes I've had were awesome! Great flavors, textures yum! Definitely will come back to try other menu options"}
{"text":"The selection of wood-fired pizzas are great but prepare to receive a small pizza and pay the price. But the price you are paying is for the location - eating at downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"The best Pizza in town,  a must have. They love and support the military. Friendly service, great prices, great location."}
{"text":"This place is a great downtown gem with some seriously fresh and tasty food. Locally owned and operated, in here they treat you like you're part of their big Italian family. The menu offers up a nice selection of pizza options all with a yummy chewy crust. They also have a few homemade pasta dishes available although I've not yet tried them. Do not miss out on the balsamic vinaigrette if you opt for salad! And for dessert? Cannoli for the win! 
I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Burrata and the Italian stallion pizza. Trust me. Just let it happen.

Waitress was bubbly and sweet. Recommended a great bottle of Barbera wine.

True neopolitan style pizza with a chill, laid back ambiance. We had a ball!"}
{"text":"Margarita pizza was weak. Don't be in a hurry. I split one with a friend and we both left hungry.
$12 for a tiny pizza so I advise getting one per person. Other pizzas at our table looked way better.
There was minimal cheese and literally only 2 bitty pieces of basil on my Margherita pizza ( don't get that one).
WEAK!"}
{"text":"The pizza was burnt, and when I told the waiter he made a discount by removing the coke from my receipt! In addition my pizza was the worst and long waiting time. I don't recommend it at all."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Nothing we got was terrible, just not really notable. The pizza was rather bland, but not awful. The spinach salad left much to be desired. Spinach, bacon, goat cheese, and dressing. I dunno...cranberries or differing would have been nice.

Also if you're going to serve \"Italian soda\" it should probably be pointed out on the menu or at least when ordering that it is in fact a can of soda from an Italy and not a traditional Italian soda with cream and such. And $2.50 for a can of misleading soda? Please. Our whole group was disappointed and sent them back. 

There most irritating thing though was the broken speaker. They had loud music playing over an extremely staticy speaker which kept jumping the volume up and down and annoying everyone there. I'm curious how long that problem has been going on.

The 7 year old seating tables was a nice touch though. That was cute.

But still. Grumble grumble."}
{"text":"We all shared different styles of pizza and they were awesome, filling.  Service was very fast.  Great place to go before a show or concert."}
{"text":"For starts...NO CRAFT BEER...IN DOWNTOWN PHX?!?!  Haha I ran into the owner and asked him about it. He recommended a good beer from Italy. 

I got a delicious pizza and the cheese ball deals, both were amazing. I don't know why I've seem elite members on yelp rate this place wayyyy below than where it should be.

Last I got a canoli. The shell was deep fried (out of the ordinary) again, delicious! 

Hats off to the owner and the crew. The one lady who was our server, eh, could do better. More personable."}
{"text":"Cute spot tucked in downtown Phoenix. Stopped in for lunch with a coworker on a Friday afternoon and the place was almost empty. I ordered the Bianca pizza. It was Delicious! I prefer my pizza a little more well done, (it was a bit soggy in the middle) but all in all it is a great place. Service was phenomenal, our waiter was very attentive but not too overbearing. I'll definitely be returning"}
{"text":"We had a party of 15 and they said they wouldn't take us unless we were all in one ticket. We were a few families in the group and we decided to find another restaurant.  My husband insisted and we went back the next day. This time they were able to put us on separate tickets. The service was better and the food was delicious. I had the Carbonara, Calamari, and my husband had the lasagna pizza (so good). I would definitely recommend this place. Everything is so yummy!"}
{"text":"Looking for a quick bite before a show at the Herberger last Saturday night (ATC's Xanadu), Jared and I headed into La Piazza Locale...

There were a handful of other diners in the place but several tables open.  When the hostess offered to seat us at a two-top, Jared kindly asked if it would be okay for us to take a four-top instead.  She hesitated but allowed us to do so, however told us that if a party of three or more came in, she would have to move us.  Understandable but kind of weird how she communicated it - with a bit of an attitude.  

I did like the casual atmosphere and noticed that the have Coke and Coca Cola Light (not Diet Coke) bottles in a cute refrigerator.  I asked about them and learned that they are imported from Mexico.

Matteo was our server and he was knowledgeable on the menu and very friendly.  We ended up ordering a mixed green salad, a meat pizza (the Italian Stallion), and a pesto pasta to share.  Read: we haven't started our new year diet just yet ;)  The salad was chilled - it almost tasted like it was in the freezer prior to arriving to our table though.  The pizza was good and so was the pasta... although it was super creamy.

We skipped dessert as we were both pretty full.  The meal was fine but nothing to rush back for.  I also learned the hard way that carbing up on pizza and pasta is probably not the best pre-show meal.  I felt like I was in a food coma and Jared had to knudge me during the show to keep me awake!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best pizza in the downtown. A friend and I came in for lunch, mid week, got sat right away. The pizza came out fast and hot, and the taste, crispness and toppings were excellent. The pizza was huge! Almost couldn't finish it and pretty much made myself sick doing so but it was too good to walk away from. Staff was friendly and attentive. So here's my only beef with this place. Canned soda? Really? That's just stupid. These guys need a soda fountain in the worst way, because the canned soda thing is so lame I almost don't want to come back just on principal. Fix that problem, and I'll be a faithful patron."}
{"text":"It's good.  The Italian Stallion and carbonara are very good.  It's fairly clean inside, but could stand some aesthetic enhancement IMO.  Prices are too high and they have occasionally run out of menu items which indicates a degree of amateurism.  But specific menu items are good so I deal with the imperfections when I'm in the mood for those items."}
{"text":"Yes, every bit of yes, would I go here again when in Phoenix. It's wood-fired pizza and it's phenomenal. We got the focaccia appetizer and the Bianca and Diavolo and it was great. Both different flavor profiles and delicious. The fresh basil really goes a long way. 

It's a cute and small place, and the service was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Great service. Some of the best Neapolitan pizza in the valley for sure. Tough parking situation but definitely worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza...hands-down, the \"best\" pizza in Phoenix...yes, better than some of the more well known places in  town (won't mention any names)

And not only are the ingredients top notch, the pizza oven they use (a very expensive import) bakes the pizzas in record time...wow!!!!!! Love this place and my new favorite pizza joint!!!"}
{"text":"We ended up here on Valentine's Day, when a bicycle-taxi driver recommended it. I'm so glad, because this was the perfect place for a decadent and sexy meal that wouldn't break the bank. The wait staff were my favorite part, as they were much friendlier (hunkier) and more helpful than most. 

Waiter helped me to choose a great table wine that was delicious but light so we could polish it off quickly. We had tickets for a show, so the kitchen rushed our pizzas out of the wood-fired oven in record time. The pizza on special was the Valentino, with mozzarella di bufala, zucchini, prosciutto and  the best crust ever. This was honestly the best crust, no kidding. 

I wish I could have stayed and savored longer. There are plenty of appetizers and small dishes to mix-and-match, including the house antipasti platter, which was also incredible. I had to take my cannoli to-go, because I was so stuffed. It made a scrumptious post-Valentine's breakfast."}
{"text":"As a self-diagnosed pizza elitist, I fully endorse this fine establishment.  I have often said there are 3 cities in which you can purchase an amazing pizza - Naples, Manhattan and Chicago.  I stand corrected - time to add Phoenix to the list.  This gem of a place imports everything from their tomatoes (San Marzano) to their cocktail ingredients (Campari, etc.).  The resulting pies are as good as anything you'll find in Naples, maybe even better because you don't have to deal with the autoestrada to get it.  If you are in Phoenix, go here - I will every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Was there for opening day for lunch.
Best pizza I have had in years. The ingredients are fresh and nothing is heavy. The staff is quick and friendly. Great for business lunches and dinner. I plan on coming back often."}
{"text":"I had such an amazing time hanging out on the patio for the Brunch and A Mixtape event. It is very important for my family to support dog friendly patios and La Piazza did such a wonderful job accommodating us. 

I ordered the caprese salad and it was the perfect portion. The mozzarella was fresh and dressed well, not drowned. What I loved most is seeing the owner happily greeting customers and working alongside the friendly staff. I'm a business owner myself and those are the two things I value most about running an establishment. 

Thank you La Piazza, see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Great pizza place with interesting toppings. Stopped in for lunch and was not disappointed. The smoky flavor of the crust added just the right flavor to the pizza. 

The decor reminded be of a Brooklyn pizza joint in the heart of downtown Phoenix. Lots of locals enjoying lunch.

Menu has a bit for everyone. A little pricey, but I thought it was worth it!"}
{"text":"I see a lot of good reviews for their pizza, but the pasta I order today is only three star. 
Tiny portion, heavy and salty sauce, not very welcome service. 
if I would be back again, maybe I will try the pizza instead of pasta."}
{"text":"Stellar pasta and salads. Good pizza. Service can be slow at times but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh... That's all I have to say! La piazza was so delicious! I will definitely be returning!:)"}
{"text":"Best marinara sauce I've ever had. I'm leaving downtown soon, and will miss this place the most."}
{"text":"We wanted pizza and since we are working the local comic convention, had to get something on the go! We found this place & it smelled quite delicious! Inside is roomy but I do imagine if it got super busy, you would defo bump elbows with your neighbors. The guy, who I think was also the owner, was very charismatic, loved the vibe he has!

We got the Rocco Pizza, and it was so good! Really enjoyed this place, if we have time after our work, would love to stop by again and try another one of their pizza's!"}
{"text":"On a business trip, we went here because it was near our hotel and the reviews were great.

We shared a calamari and then I had the all meat pizza. Everything was awesome.

We ate at around 2:15pm and they close at 3pm for a break before dinner. The chef walks out in a shirt. We start talking with him and he's an FOB (fresh off the boat) from the old country whose English is a little broken. So this place at least has a chef who is actually from the place where the food is purportedly representative of."}
{"text":"ATROCIOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE.  A few weeks before my spouse's birthday, I called ahead to reserve a table for 12.  They informed me that they don't take reservations, but would do their best.  Four days before the birthday dinner, I called to let them know our party had now increased to 20 and to ask if this would be a problem, as I would change our dinner venue.  They informed me they should be fine to accommodate and took my contact details.  The birthday evening, we arrive ahead of time only to be told that another party of 15 was expected and whichever group got there first would get to be seated.  I was annoyed, but thankfully, our party arrived soon and they offered to seat us 10 inside and 10 outside. ??? Not exactly the birthday celebration set up I wanted, nor was this ever mentioned as a logistics challenge.  We reluctantly agreed to be seated only to continue to be treated rudely by the wait staff multiple additional times.  Enough was enough and we left.  Not once during our visit did we hear a polite, welcoming or grateful phrase from the staff.  Give this one a miss.  Hanny's across the street is a MUCH better dining choice with FAR superior service!"}
{"text":"You're all doing it wrong.  

While I like their pizza I have equally good pizza right next to my house in Cibo.  Their Calzone however...That's what you should be ordering.  They fry their calzone as opposed to baking it.  It winds up like an italian fry bread filled with sausage and cheese and olives.  It's like going to a fair in Italy.  

I worry about Locale.  In a sea of fantastic pizza that is Downtown Phoenix it's equally good but for some reason gets none of the love as the surrounding pizza spots."}
{"text":"First, I absolutely loved the staff. I went in to get my food (I ordered) and we had miscommunication, and they fixed it. Not just fixed it but redid my order and asked if I wanted the extras.

The food:

Was good but a little burnt on the bottom of the pizza. Did not take away from the flavor of the meat. I will say that the dough is amazing. Will not say \"loved\" it because it was a little burnt but the pizza was really freaking good, mainly because their dough and meats (meat pizza) are good. So good that I will order it again when I am back in Phoenix.

The best thing on the menu is that Nutella dessert. If you do not get it, then you should slap yourself in the face."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food. Everything was super fresh and the service was excellent. I found the menu to be a little pricey for the portions you get."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place.  4+ stars on yelp, featured on Food TV, and voted best in Phx 2014.  Well, I can name at least 4 places in Yucson with MUCH better pizza.  The crust was burnt, the sauce had no flavor and the pizza had very little sausage on it.  On top of all that the ricotta they put on must have been put on after the pizza came out of the oven because it was cold and threw off the senses."}
{"text":"Hidden Jewel in dtphx!  Perfect spot to grab a super tasty lunch or dinner before a Suns or Dbacks game.  This place is in the old Cartel spot.  It is cozy but comfortable and inviting.  Both times I have dined there the staff is super friendly.  The pizza is AMAZING.  I would rank local joints like this: 
1) Bianco's
2) La Piazza Locale
3) Federal Pizza
4) The Parlor
5) Cibo
6) Pomo
So since Bianco's is ranked nationally this place is holding its own in a close 2nd.  
Check it out ASAP."}
{"text":"I never had a pizza with so much flavor before. Very delicious. Decent size for one person that likes to eat. Italian Stallion is a great way to go if you really like flavorful meats. Service was terrific."}
{"text":"First time there for lunch today with friends.  They had been before, I have not.  It was great pizza and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  From what I understand the wood fire pizza oven is imported from Italy by way of New York.  It was formerly used in one of Mario Batali's restaurants.  The sauce, meets and cheeses are fantastic and if you love authentic Italian pizza as much as I do you need to check this place out.  The service is good.  Of course at lunch it can be busy but the service is good.  They do not want you to wait but know the food is good so you should. Chef-Owner, Justin Piazza, assured us he would secure a table for us quickly despite the heavy Friday lunch crowd.  Thank goodness my friends faces are regulars, he came out of the kitchen to greet us. I had the Montanara, and it was so good. My friend had the Italian Stallion and it was also fantastic, great for meat lovers. 
I would like to go back and seriously, try one of everything on the menu.  
They intend to add outdoor seating with a railed patio that runs the store front which will be nice."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place. We waited for a table and another group just jumped in and sat down. If that's their policy, they should have let us know.."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I actually love both locations Phx and Glendale. We decided to try a new Italian restaurant nearby and were greatly disappointed. We then decided to walk over to La Piazza Phx for dessert. Best decision of the night. 

The food at both restaurants are great. The pizza from the brick oven, the fresh pasta, and the homemade desserts. I tried the fried risotto balls (arancini nepoletana) while the others had the ricotta cheesecake and a cannoli. 

I learned my lesson not to stray from a sure thing."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza with great homemade mozzarella. The salad and beers were also  very good."}
{"text":"Excellent quality. Loved the pizza dough.  Sauce is light and bright. Fried mozzarella for an app. Fresh made in house!!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Phoenix.  Period, it's better than Pomo, it's better than Chris Bianco, it's better than LGO, it's better than East of Chicago.  It's also less pretencious than all of those places.  Don't mistake their unassuming ambiance they are creating Italian art.  Regina Margh and Diavolo are where it's at."}
{"text":"A fantastic Napoletana pizza. I'm already going to be a regular- I'm totally in love. Some of the best pizza I've had on the west coast period."}
{"text":"Out of all of my favorite pizzerias in Phoenix, it has taken me awhile to get around to reviewing La Piazza Phx (formerly Locale). For those of you unfamiliar, this is the sister-restaurant of La Piazza al Forno. The menu has similarities, with the addition of some unique items that are excluded from their Glendale restaurant.

Make no mistake, the pizza served here is identical to Al Forno in regards to taste, but that has both its pros and cons. 

The Regina Marghertia D.O.C. (Denominazione di Origine Controllata), which is just a fancy way of saying that it adheres to strict VPN guidelines, is a textbook example of how simplicity and tradition always win. No BBQ chicken/sauce to be found here thank goodness!

Additionally, they also serve another personal favorite, the Dolce Diavolo. I've had various versions of this style of pizza at many places, but the addition of honey gives this creation what I'd refer to as a power-up! I've often said that if I opened up my own pizzeria, this would be one of the pizzas that I'd shamelessly rip-off and rename for my own menu. Additionally, the Pizza Fritte, which is a fried calzone, appears to be unique to this location and comes highly recommended.

All the ingredients they use are top notch, but I've often found that their dough is very dense, heavy, and often times, just way too damned salty. This makes the dough far more filling that you would expect from this kind of pizza.

They don't offer regular bread as a starter, so you're stuck getting a focaccia, which is basically like eating a bare-bones pizza before eating an actual pizza. If you order the Angioletti for dessert, you end up coming to the realization 95% of what you've consumed for dinner was essentially just a bunch of dough.

Their pastas are okay, but nothing I'd really go out of my way to obtain. I previously vouched for the carbonara, but found it to be unusually salty on our most recent visit.

Sadly, I've never been a big fan of Al Forno's desserts. Finding a cheesecake or cannoli in Phoenix is as easy as locating a QuickTrip. We usually opt for the Angioletti con Nutella, but I find myself preferring the more liberally prepared Nutella calzones, crepes, and pizzas served at other joints.

Overall, I like and respect what they're doing here in terms of adhering to tradition. And while I'll admit that their pizza is usually decent, I do feel there are better places to go if you're familiar with the surrounding area's pizza scene."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I work nearby and whenever I get the chance I suggest this place for lunch with the co-workers.

All three times I have been there I have gotten the same thing, the pesto pasta. I think the pasta is homemade because it melts in your mouth. The sauce is delicious. It is a very generous serving and I always tell myself I am only going to eat half but I end up eating the whole thing. Gluttony. 

Although I have only been here for lunch, this would be a perfect date night spot. The inside is quite romantic and they have a great wine list."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Would highly recommend this restaurant. Loved everything!!! I had the Caprese and the Carbonara. The menu has wines paired for each dish which is helpful. Must go if in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Had great reviews, however there is much better quality in other competing pizza restaurants. Service was more interested in Whatever drama was happening amongst employees that night and was outside on front sidewalk most of the night.  Plus, they don't have a full bar and was out of just about every beer on their menu. Pizza was good, however is comparable elsewhere with fresher ingredients and better service and more selection Overall, there is better places to go, but edible."}
{"text":"The first night we tried to come here, the place was packed because of a nearby concert so we ended up leaving instead of waiting (even though we waited a while to be acknowledged). When we came back the following night, the place wasn't as busy and we had a much better experience. 

Even though I was craving pizza previously, I ended up ordering pasta. We got the fried mozzarella appetizer, and it was SO GOOD. We were expecting mozzarella sticks but it was more like mozzarella squares. The cheese was great. My pasta was good, but I tried one of my coworkers pieces of pizza and the pizza was EXCELLENT. So much better, and I would definitely order pizza instead if I ever go back. The menu is a little confusing because it looks like 6 pizzas are the same thing but with different types of cheeses, but ask the waiter and you'll figure it out."}
{"text":"Came here with some Yelp Elite friends after touring POPology at the Arizona Science Center, as one of them suggested we go to take advantage of the $7 pizza deal (it was for National Pizza Day only). We showed up to find a mostly empty restaurant which led to great attentiveness by the wait staff. We ordered 3 margherita pizzas and between the 5 of us it was a perfect amount of food. The pizza was fresh out the brick oven and looked/tasted as much -- 10/10!

So why the -1 star, you ask? Well, the chalkboard when you walk in invites you to ask them about their \"New Craft Beers!\" When we asked the waitress, she advised that they do not have any craft beer yet. Soooo...why put that already on a sign? It was a bit disappointing but the pizza definitely provided a rebound to the experience. I will be coming back and recommend the pizza for sure."}
{"text":"Service was prompt. They didn't tell me about the specials. The food is meh.  It wasn't bad. But I wasn't impressed either. I guess the homemade mozzarella and meat stuffed noodles sounded so great but it was kind of on the bland side. It wasn't bad. Just not very bold or wow for the price."}
{"text":"Great Napoleon style pizza!  The Margarita pizza was our favorite, but I really liked the crusts on all the pizzas -- thin on the bottom yet voluminous at the edge. The pizzas are actually cooked in their 900 degree oven in just 90 seconds! Overall the service from Jenny was fast and friendly. Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for pizza."}
{"text":"Very creative and flavorful pizza. Not the typical recipes you get at the big chains. They also had some tasty Italian beer that I'd never experienced before. Excellent, friendly service. The only negative was a family sitting nearby with a 2 year old. The parents thought she was Shirley Temple as they let her roam around the restaurant yelling at the top of her lungs. Nothing the management could do."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place for a couple of years and finally made it for dinner on a Saturday. The food was good, but not great. I was disappointed in the atmosphere of the restaurant. I expected nice tables and dim lighting, like a true Neapolitan pizza place, but instead it was freezing inside, the music was loud and not fitting. The chairs were uncomfortable and cold. It kind of felt like I was in a cafeteria, or at a casual lunch spot."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizzas in town! I also love that they have Coca-Cola in a bottle (as silly as it may sound) I think it is so refreshing.   I recommend the \"Italian Stallion\" pizza."}
{"text":"I have never been to a pizza restaurant that ran out of pizza dough.

Had to order some pasta.  

It wasn't too bad.  The sauce was good and had a nice flavor.

Comfortable little place, though.  Attentive, friendly service.

However, the bread (or whatever it is) that they give you is gross.

Guess I'll go back later and try their pizza."}
{"text":"I LOVE La Piazza and finally had the opportunity to visit the Phoenix location. My friend and I split the Rucola salad and the Quattro Formaggio pizza with sausage. It was so incredibly good and we left no food behind. If you are in the mood for some delicious and authentic pizza, I highly recommend La Piazza!"}
{"text":"This NYC girl loves their pizza. There. I said it. There's a place worthy of a New Yorker in the valley. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Having eaten a few times at Pomo, I awaited the opening of La Piazza Locale with much anticipation.  We like Pomo so much that another AVPN approved pizzeria had to be a good thing.  We were really disappointed.  Where Pomo is both classy and warm, this place was low rent.  The waiter was not particularly knowledgeable about the food and didn't seem to care that we were in the restaurant.  The pizza was not all that great.  I realize that this type of pizza is not the same as what people are used to, but we have some other examples in the downtown area of what it can and should be (Bianco, Pomo, CIbo) and these pies were just too thin and soggy in the middle, most of the dough was devoted to the edges and a bit too charred.  I had the unfortunately named Italian Stallion and was not impressed.  When we had some left over we had to flag down the water and ask for a box, after which a styrofoam clamshell - too small for what was left - was dumped on our table.  There were none of the little desert-ish extras that make Pomo so special.  I had hoped, particularly due to its location, that this would be a great place for dinner before a Diamondbacks game, but we are not likely to go back."}
{"text":"If you are in the downtown area and looking for some delicious pizza this is an excellent choice. La Piazza is right across the street from Cityscape next to Cartel Coffee and is certified by Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana so you know this is legit Neapolitan style pizza. 

In addition to pizzas they have salad, paninis, pasta, and a few appetizers. We started out with the arancini appetizer (AKA Palle di Riso) and shared the Napoletana pizza. The arancini was superb. It had a perfect crispy fried outer coating with perfectly cooked risotto, small chunks of prosciutto, rapini, and mozzarella. It was topped with arugula and covered in a delightful tomato sauce. The flavors and textures complimented each other well. I'd definitely get this again!

I wasn't a fan of the flavors in my pizza. The toppings for the Napoletana are anchovies, olives, parmesan, capers, mozzarella, fresh basil, and tomato sauce. I should have known that this would be a super salty pizza based on the ingredients alone. I had never had anchovies on a pizza before, and the ones on my slices were so salty I had to take them off and eat them without the fish. It wouldn't look as nice but for me if they were chopped into smaller pieces that would disperse the flavors out more. The olives, parmesan, and capers additionally added to the salt level so in general I felt like it was a very unbalanced tasting pizza. I did enjoy the sauce, fresh mozzarella and lovely crust though. The crust was crisp with a slight outer char on the outside with a tender chewiness on the inside. 

As for drinks, you should definitely get the iced tea. It's made by Infusion Coffee and Tea in Tempe, and the desert blossom tea I tried was so flavorful and refreshing. 

Service was not the friendliest but got the job done. Drinks were refilled as needed and we were checked up on adequately.

Overall it was a good experience. I'll be back to try a different pizza and to get that delicious arancini!"}
{"text":"Ingredients. La Piazza PHX has the best ingredients over any other competitor. First we started off with Angioletti Fritti and the Foccacia. Both were delicious. For the main course we ordered Lasagne Ah' Pizz. The tomatoes really stood out. Ricotta is my favorite ingredient to add to a pizza, but even the tomatoes stood out over the ricotta. They were definitely imported tomatoes. We are talking DOP standards here. Nothing but the best.  The restaurant is small so you might miss it. You will not want to attempt to park in a parking garage like we did. Instead they have parking right in front of the restaurant.  The staff is very friendly and made some good food suggestions.  I am not a big fan of soda in a glass bottle at restaurants because 99% of the time it is and has been expired for a while which makes it tasteless. I would definitely go back and would strongly suggest over Pizzeria Bianco. It is much easier to get into, tastes better and isn't cramped inside like PB."}
{"text":"La Piazza is another pizza gem in Phoenix. 

We started with the Palle Di Riso, which was delicious. The coating was crunchy, light, and not greasy. The risotto inside had great texture and flavor as well. 

Sampled both the the Dolce Diavolo and Rocco pizzas. The Dolce Diavolo was the stand-out between the two. Sopressata, Calabrian chiles, and honey form the perfect combination: sweet, savory, and a bit of heat (pretty genius, right?). The Rocco was delicious as well, but not quite as good. The crust (made using an 18 year old starter) was fantastic. Nice service and unpretentious atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food, great pizza, great people. I love this place. Thankfully opened closer to where I lived in downtown phoenix. I would eat here every day if I could."}
{"text":"I love their food. I cannot honestly think of a better more traditional Italian restaurant than this place!!!! Please please please get the carbonara and ANY type of pizza. If I could afford to eat here every single day I would! They have traditional homestyle pizza that does not even do Napoli justice!"}
{"text":"So I was wandering downtown, vaguely pretending to be in Europe, when I looked down a side street and saw neon proclaiming \"piazza locale.\" I thought to myself: \"If I were actually in Europe, that's where I'd have dinner -- the little place down the side street, not the big tourist scene.\" So I did that thing.

The pizza is incredible. Pure tomato flavor in the sauce. Speck. Speck is good. There is the promise of anchovies on other pies. Interesting flavor combos, crusts to crawl over broken glass for, wine recommendations that actually work, and staff who are helpful and attentive in a soothing way. 

Having generated leftovers in a stylish box, I will smile at two more meals this weekend. Prices are extremely reasonable for artisanal pizza in a pleasant environment."}
{"text":"I went with a group of 6 last weekend and we had a reservation so there was no wait. I would recommend reservations for large groups as the place is pretty small. We were seated immediately and looked over the drink menu. They are mainly a beer and wine place but they do have a few cocktails on draft. None of the cocktails looked that appealing so I stuck with wine.

We started with the Mozzarella in Carrozza, and the Palle di Riso. The 2nd dish was really special, I had never tried anything like it before, it's a risotto ball stuffed with prosciutto and mozzarella. It's a must try.

We ordered quite a few pizzas for the table, my two favorites were the Italian Stallion and the Lasagne Ah' Pizza, both had delicious San Marzan and Schreiner's Sausage. 

Our server was attentive and the food was above average, however with there being so many other pizza joints in the valley this once just gets 3 stars A-ok. If I was in the area I would try it again, but I wouldn't necessarily seek it out."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have EVER had. The owner is very down to earth. I was contemplating walking over from the Palomar and I am so glad that I did. Nothing in Boston compares, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Tuesday night 6pm. Me and my sis were downtown for a concert at US Airways. Came here based on the great reviews and because it was close by. It was not crowded but it was full enough for a Tuesday. Had a glass of wine and the Bianca pizza. It was delicious!! I'd love to try the pastas and salads. I will definitely be back for more. My only complaint is the bathroom in the back is a little dark and grungy."}
{"text":"Really? This is good pizza? Sorry to say, it's not for me. The crust was chewy and couldn't support the toppings. Also I threw away so much crust because it was just dry and chewy. 
Without the side of tangy marinara sauce that I asked for, the pie would have been bland and not worthy.

Desserts looked okay. If you like italian sweets, order a cannoli. It's large (about 6\") for five bucks. The tiramisu is rather expensive. A small portion will set you back $8."}
{"text":"Had the Italian Stallion and it was great.  I liked this place better than Bianco in terms of pizza.  The salad was a bit bland though.  I would definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Hands down best pizza in Phx.  Beats pizzeria bianco to a tomato pulp.  If you want an authentic wood fired pizza come here. Great family run restaurant. High quality food at reasonable prices.  You cannot beat this pie.  You'd have to travel to Italy to try and find a better pizza, sauce etc"}
{"text":"The pizza at this place was so great. I could have eaten a whole pizza by myself, both because they are pretty thin, and because it was that good. I got the traditional margherita and I was in love. I also got the calamari and that was decent, the mushroom white pizza was good (I am not a white pizza fan though), and we got a basic spaghetti pasta to share, and everything was outstanding. I recommend coming here! I was very impressed."}
{"text":"We tripped over this place. Downtown for a concert and were not sure where to eat. I had the carbonara and my wife had the pesto pasta. We both loved it.  We are both Italian and grew up on Italian food.  This has been some of the best pasta I have had in Arizona.   Dont come here if you are looking for a fancy place and ambiance. I've eaten at many of those places and the food usually lacks. By the way, the prices are really reasonable abd the waiter Charles did a great job. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Great Pizza!!! Had the Margherita and Salciccia pizzas, both were excellent. Great service as well, super friendly waitress and the rest of the staff was super accommodating. Only thing I was kind of missing, and it's not a big deal was the lack of beer on tap, preferably a local craft brew type. Would love to see some local breweries represented. Other than the lack of beer on tap this place is the shizz!! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The pizza here is really great and atmosphere is very cozy and welcoming. Great for a stuff."}
{"text":"Was visiting Phoenix for work and this place was a close walk from my hotel. The service was excellent and you need to try the Italian Stallion meat pie it is just Awesome. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love this place! We have tried several different appetizer, pizza and pasta combinations and they are all awesome!  We always get Mateo as our waiter and his service is always on point!  He gives great recommendations, answers any questions and always brings a warm friendly vibe to the experience.  Great job guys! You're our fav!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Az hands down!!! I love this place. It is VPN certified and lives up to the expectations. Great pizza, amazing service and awesome vibes inside the restaurant. Loved it. Perfectly run business. Keep doing what your doing!!!!"}
{"text":"It's funny as I read the through the \"gangster group playing loud music\" review since I also was there the same night and same time. However My review is a bit different. I did NOT find the staff or the large group rude or offensive nor playing offensive music in my opinion. They were more so simply enjoying their night out as a group, which seemed to be mainly about discussing music anyways, and calmed down after a mere 5 minutes or so and then continued on with general conversation prior to their meals arriving. The waitress still attended everyone else in the restaurant including myself and the large group with the music in the upmost perfect and respectful manner as should always be presented. The food was spectacular and service was quick and spunky just as I enjoy. I will DEFINITELY be coming back again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Everything I have ordered from here is fresh and delicious.  I vote it better than bianco!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch in between class at law school right around the corner. Service was quick and informative. We got the Caprese appetizer...it was ok and I've had better. Needs a nice aged balsamic to bump it up. I got the Italian Stallion...AWESOME! Excellent dough and ingredients, ate the whole thing by myself in about 10 minutes. My wife got the pesto pasta dish, added artichoke hearts. Great pesto, but they couldn't add grilled chicken. Would have made it my wife's new go to italian dish for lunch downtown. Ordered a Blue Moon, but waiter came back saying they were out. Suggested a Peroni, my first time trying. Tastes like a Bud Light"}
{"text":"Downtown Phoenix. Saturday. Comicon was on. We needed good food within a few blocks of the convention center. 

I have eaten at La Piazza al Forno in downtown Glendale so I knew these people could make good pizza. We arrived at Locale soon after they opened at 2pm, and the place was hoppin'. I was part of a party of three, which ended up perfect: a pizza bianca split three ways, plus different side salads for each of us.  I had the rucola salad; I was impressed with the size of the salad, and the dressing and arugula were delicious together.

Now, to the pizza. Imagine a vat of divine cheese. Fling your tastebuds into that. That's the bianca. Their crust isn't my favorite, I confess, but it's still yummy, and that fresh cheese is soooo good. 

Plus, delightful air conditioning (me wearing a steampunk costume in 110-degree heat was not the smartest of ideas) and a server who was willing to constantly refill our water glasses... coming here was the perfect choice. Plus, I got to show some out-of-town friends that Phoenix has some darn delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Truly excellent pizza - The Italian Stallion! What was better than the pizza? The service was second to none!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  ...Not really much more I can add to that :)
Fresh, delicious and ingredients that are TOP Quality !

I am not affiliated with the restaurant or staff. 

ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Has to be the best wood fired pizza I've had ever.  Did the stallion and a Bianco with fennel sausage.   At first seemed pricy but was well worth it the the quality.  Can't find this wood fired pizza in Chicago lol."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix!!  Justin Piazza and staff go out of their way to make everyone feel like a VIP, and the food is beyond compare. The Italian Stallion is my favorite, but don't overlook the others, either.  The sausage/rappini/smoked mozzarella was outstanding!! Be sure to leave room for dessert, too. Both the cheesecake and the Tiramisu will rock your world. Outstanding food, friendly and professional service, casual atmosphere, and reasonable prices make La Piazza Locale a must-go location for downtown eating."}
{"text":"Looooooove the pizza and the freshness of ingredients here. I originally went to the one in down town Glendale and this one, although the menu is slightly different, is just as good! Service is friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is welcoming, but truly the pizza brings us back again and again.

I do have to say though the Glendale cheesecake is much better, in my opinion (hubs loved both)"}
{"text":"After walking all day at phoenix comic con 2015, this was the right place to stop, rest, eat brick oven pizza.  The best service out there, the wait was about 15 mins during heavy volumes, but the service once you sat down was Top Notch. Then the pizzas come out and you know you will be back soon. Thank to the cooks and staff...well done."}
{"text":"My first time here. Met some long time friends here. Highly recommended by all. I have to say I was really pleased. No only was the vibe quaint and cozy but the food and service was excellent. 

The menu has a variety of excellent choices for every palette!  I had the house red for starters. Very nice touch and a superb compliment to the meal. 

When my friends came in we ordered the focaccia bread. Its a meal pretending to be a starter! I got the calzone. They normally fry (Fritte) their calzone but I asked to have it baked in the pizza oven. Not their typical way but I was very happy they were able to do it!  I'm a bit of a freak for a good calzone and this one did not disappoint!  

The ingredients were as fresh as can be and the ricotta was soooo fresh and flavorful! My friends had one if the classic signature pies.  No complaints from anyone. One really cool thing was lots of people from downtown coming by! Like a neighborhood inside a ginormous metro area!  

Love that, don't you. Take the time to get downtown and stop in for great food and service! Oh, the wine was good too!"}
{"text":"After attending a sporting event in downtown, we were definitely in the mood for some good food in the area, especially as there are tons of neat little places to try. We walked over the La Piazza because of the great ratings and....well, it's pizza!
Pizza is wood fired and the oven can be seen right inside the dining area. Dining area is small, but definitely warm and intimate.
My hubs had the pizza (his usual pepperoni). Totally delicious. The crust was thick and the bread dough added amazing flavor. Fresh mozzarella and delicious sauce was the highlight.
We will definitely be back again. Overall, great place to try whether it's a casual or date night."}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza ever! Authentic, delicious, great atmosphere and friendly server. Definitely will be back with all our friends."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've had in awhile. The crust is amazing, crunchy on the outside, but chewy on the inside. I got the Filetti D.O.C. which consisted of tomatoes, basil, garlic and fresh mozzarella. The combination was divine. Good cocktail and salad as well as good service. Nice to see that downtown PHX has so many good pizza options."}
{"text":"Love the pizza!!! The crust has the right amount of chew. The sauce is bright and full of flavor. And the service was great."}
{"text":"While downtown for Final Four activities, we stopped in for early dinner. Great little place, good menu, and wonderful service.
The pizza was great - definitely fresh ingredients and delicious.
I recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit. The lady at the door remembered us, which was cool, and her service was great. They have upgraded their antipasto platter, and I highly recommend it. We also shared an excellent spinach salad which contained lots of real European quality bacon. The espresso was an excellent  finish. The service is paced to your needs, which makes this perfect if you're going to an event downtown."}
{"text":"Fanastic food, prompt service, they are always on point. I have frequented the original location in Glendale and thought I would give the Phoenix location a try while working late tonight. 

I called my order in about an hour before I planned to pick it up and arrived to find it had not yet been started. I found this to be a little concerning, however, I was assured it wouldn't take more than three minutes to get my pizza and they were not lying. 

The pizza is fantastic as ever and they are quick to resolve any issues, but if you are expecting to just quickly pick up and walk out durng a lunch rush you might want to be very clear to have the order ready and waiting."}
{"text":"This place was so yummy! We arrived around 6:30pm and it was somewhat empty so we didn't have to wait long on the food. We got the 4 cheese pizza and the meat pie. Both were freshly made and brought out. Very good meats, the ham was thin and not overpowering.  The cheeses were perfectly blended and worked well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because our server seemed a bit off and gave us a strange vibe. Otherwise very good pizza. I wouldn't recommend for huge groups. The pizzas are just enough for 2 people."}
{"text":"Thank you yelp. You never dissapoint me.

Oven brick pizza with delicious flavors. Got the Italian Stallion \"meat pie\". Crisp crust, dough was light, sauce was just delicious. 

San Marzano Tomatoes D.O.P., House-Made Mozzarella, Schreiner's Sausage, Pepperoni, Prosciutto di Parma (Cotto), Sopressata, all just tastefully done. Every bite was amazing. 


$15 for the meat pie

Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Sisters with la piazza al forno on Glendale.  Love both places. Ahhh mayyyy singggggggg. Love ittt

The quattro stagioni was absolutely delicious.  I highly recommend it. :)"}
{"text":"Wow! I got the margarita pizza which is a cheese pizza. It was so delicious. I love how they make their own mozzarella cheese. Service was fast and friendly. Rare these days with some places. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The pizza was absolutely delicious!  The different sauces and flavors worked so well together, and service was great.  I would definitely recommend to anyone if you like great pizza!"}
{"text":"So........my mom is in town and I have been telling her about all the amazing pizza joints that I have been to since moving to Phoenix.  She is always down for some pizza so we decided to get some tonight.  We were going to go to the OG one in Glendale but its \"Christmas Light Season\" so I heard that they are always slammed and waits can be a bitch.  I figured that this one wouldn't be crowded so we drove downtown to try it out.

We found parking right out in front.  You are supposed to pay at the little kiosk thing but my mom is an old, hobbled soul who can't walk...aka, handicapped plates!  Score!   The place was easy enough to find.  It's not in a super duper obvious spot but it's right in the heart of downtown about a block or so from the stadiums etc.

We walked in and were seated by a table at the window. We placed our order for 2 Cokes ($3.00, liter of Mexican Coke in a bottle), a Pizza Fritte aka Calzone and a Salciccia e Friarielle pizza.  About 5 minutes later our food was out.  Here is how it tasted.....................

Salciccia e Friarielle ($15.00)-  My mom really likes sausage on pizza.  There were a few pizza options that had sausage and this one sounded unique and delicious, so we tried it.  This pizza came with smoked mozzarella di Bufala, Schreiners (Local sausage place) sausage, rapini (kale...looked like broccoli rabe kind of) and olive oil.  I should have probably read the description better because I swear that this one came with red sauce.  Nope...it was a white pie (olive oil based sauce).  First bite in, I noticed a few different things.  1.  The smoked mozzarella di Bufala is incredibly smoky!  It had a super strong flavor profile which was just a tad overpowering.  It was good, but not pizza good...that cheese would be better with crackers or wine or something on its own..not melted on pizza.  2.  This pizza was really \"wet\".  When I removed my first slice, I noticed that the plate that it was on was real wet on the bottom.  The crust was more soggy than normal and it was hard to pick up, fold and eat.  Almost a knife and fork job.  The non soggy crust was fantastic though and the rapini put a unique spin on the pizza.  The Schreiners sausage was the best part of the thing.  They cubed up this sausage and it was spread out evenly.  It was delicious.  A plain margherita pizza with sausage as a topping may be the way to go if you are a sausage lover.  We ate the whole thing, it was pretty tasty and unique but I would never order it again. Not bad by any means, just different and every other pizza I have had from this pizza family has been way better.

Pizza Fritte (Calzone) ($10.00)-  Wow!  Just WOW!  You want to talk about massive!  This thing is the size of a football!  This calzone is unique in the fact that they fry this bitch instead of bake it.  I cut this thing open and saw the fantastic ingredients of mozzarella, ricotta, salami and tomatoes just begging to be shoved in my mouth.  It comes topped with basil strips and served with a side of marinara sauce.  I took a bite of the dough and was hooked.  Its like eating Indian fry bread in pizza dough form.  It was very unique and very tasty.  This thing was so big that I had to take half of it home.  Good morning breakfast!  Can't wait!  I will definitely get this thing again.  For sheer value ($10.00), its the best thing on the menu.  

Service was great!   Our waitress was on top of things and checked in with us a few times during our meal. 

4 stars for now because of a few things.  First, it's way far away from my house in Surprise.  Second, the Glendale one is closer, tastes better and has more of a \"homey\" feel to it.  If I am ever downtown though watching a Suns/Dbacks game and want some pizza, I will definitely head over here again."}
{"text":"Today is my 3rd time in 2 weeks this place id awesome one of the best pizza if not the best in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Living and working downtown I have my fair share of pizza joints to choose from and I like to change it up regularly to rotate my business.  If I had to choose my favorite pizza it would be Locale.  Why you ask?  Their crust.  It has the perfect texture smooth and chewy inside with a crisp exterior specked with just the right amount of char to add a smokey flavor.  The dough is not tough and overworked like a few places plus it has the right balance of salt and sweetness.  My second favorite thing is the red sauce.  The tomato flavor in the sauce is simple perfection.  My mom grows and home cans her own San Marzano tomatoes so I can be a bit particular about the flavor when someone says they are using these in their sauce.  

I can not speak to the sit down service as I have only ever ordered carry out which is super quick and too easy when the last thing I want to do is cook after work."}
{"text":"I walk by here every afternoon during my mid day walks. Today I decided to walk in and try some of their famous Napoletana pizza. I ordered the Dolce Diavolo pizza and I was in heaven.
I truly could have eaten the entire pie served, but I did not want to fall asleep at my desk the rest of the afternoon. The crust was cooked to perfection. The cheese and the sauce where amazing. My favorite part of the pizza was the spicy bite the Calabrian Chiles had.
I am definitely coming back to try the other variety of pizzas they serve.

This place is highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"Yum!  You must eat here. Amazing Napoletana pizza. Great drinks. The \"Last, but not Leaf\" is so good!  Really awesome people taking care of you while you eat and interesting people watching in the big city of Phoenix."}
{"text":"The Husband and I went here on our self made 'food crawl.' We has already gotten some monkey bread and an (awful) sushi roll, we were looking forward to some pizza. We had been waffling between going here and going to Pomo, but decided to go here because it was closer and we figured they would be about the same. When we got here, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table. The service was prompt and friendly. We decided to just get two items here and cut out the last place on our crawl. We ordered the arancini and the fried pizza. The arancini sounded really good..... but it was really bad. It was not cooked enough, the cheese in the middle wasn't melted at all...still cubes. The meat was in one clump, not mixed into the risotto as I would have thought. The frying oil may not have been hot enough because the arancini tasted like it was just full of oil.... pretty gross. We did eat it anyway as we spent 8$ on it, but I would not recommend it to anyone. Then our pizza came. Again, wasn't cooked long enough. Really? The cheese wasn't melted. Did they not see that? The sauce was cold and tasted like the can. The fried dough was, again, way too oily, probably because the oil wasn't hot enough. It was like a bland greasy doughnut with unmelted cheese and can tasting tomatoes on top. So gross. I took most of it to go and gave it to a homeless person. That plus a couple of beers was like 45- 50$....what a huge waste of money. Will not be back."}
{"text":"La Piazza is mostly delicious and very authentic.  The interior is stylish, the music creates the perfect ambiance, and our waiter was pleasant and prompt.  
We started dinner with the risotto rice balls. These were definitely the best part of the meal:  crispy and crunchy on the outside but soft, tender, and chewy on the inside.  We split the carbonara for the main course.  It was also tasty -- some might find the pasta too soft but I personally thought it was cooked perfectly.  My one complaint would be I thought it a smidge too salty, likely because of the copious amounts of pork mixed in.  The peas cut the saltiness a little bit, but I was still draining glasses of water.

The dessert was weak, in my eyes.  We had the Nutella and fried dough strips.  The dough itself was oily and there was not enough Nutella or powdered sugar to combat it.  The bathrooms were also a little dirty.

On the whole, though, the restaurant offers a lovely, authentic Italian experience at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"There is no better pizza on the planet outside of Italy - these guys have it nailed!

Ingredients are fresh and flavorful, and the pizza is baked in that awesome wood-fire stove - the aroma is amazing. This is the best pizza in the valley. That last finish of olive oil is a perfect touch. Eventually I will order the other options on the menu which also look great."}
{"text":"Excellent downtown spot...Great pizza, salad and sandwiches. They have pasta but have not tried it yet.  The star here is the pizza here get one and share or eat a whole one yourself you will not want to work after but you will be satisfied for sure!"}
{"text":"Just ok. It was my first time visiting; chose location based on ratings. I'm a 'sauce person' so I got the Margarita DOC w/Extra sauce of course! Unfortunately, it was nothing to write home about; it was just okay. The sauce lacked flavor and was surprisingly thin...best way I can describe my initial thoughts after tasting it is that it was similar to the flavor and consistency you'd remember from the canned Chef Boyarde spaghetti-O's you ate when you were 5.  The pizza dough however was tasty and I liked the fresh garlic and basil on top. It couldn't mask the disappointing sauce, but it helped. Would I recommend this place based on what I had? Probably not. Although other items on the menu may be good, this one just did not hit the spot."}
{"text":"The pizza was great.  I asked for a cheese pizza and I ordered two of their most popular pizzas.  Good and fast service for any late night check in at the Hyatt."}
{"text":"Excellent Neopolitan pizza, friendly staff. Terrific fried mozzarella. The iced tea wasn't my favorite."}
{"text":"This place is off the chain! The pizza was so crispy and chewy at the same time and the sauce was outstanding! Can't wait to work my way down at the menu!"}
{"text":"The ragu and bread are superb! The pizza was a little watery from the mozzarella, otherwise I would give the place 4 stars."}
{"text":"Very nice place, and the Puttanesca was full of flavor! The pizza was also delicious. It can be a good place for a first date :)"}
{"text":"We just stumbled in here and had one of the best meals. This was some of the best pizza I've ever had! We had the Dolce Diavolo and had an order of the mozzarella sticks. Everything was amazing! They make their mozzarella in house. The service was great and fast. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great place!  Didn't 5 Star because of a few things but let's just say wow on the pies! Had the margarita pizza and the Italian stallion. Great! Great!  Highly recommend. Issues was that they forgot our salad didn't recognize that they did but good news was that is was not on the bill when we got it. Other than that great place!"}
{"text":"So, I've been back a dozen times and for the most part haven't ordered the same pizza twice. Even the pasta was fantastic! Mateo is seriously one of the most gifted chefs I've had the honor of meeting. How he can transform a simple pizza into a complex dining experience blows me away. Most of the times I get lunch here, my coworkers are equally excited to see what creation I will return with. Yeah, it's just that good; he's just that good.

Owner Justin told me Mateo is working on specialty pizzas to rotate in the menu for 2014. I can't wait to see what he comes up with. I'm salivating just thinking about it!"}
