{"text":"Chicken so good makes you want to slap your mamma!  I personally find a certain charm in out-dated decor, friendly staff and food that keeps you coming back. And this place has all that. I got the Jerk Chicken lunch special and it was bomb-diggity. Chicken was super tender, not too spicy and very reasonably priced. Rice was perfectly cooked and the coleslaw was very delicious and not bombed with mayo. Frankly, I was very impressed by the entire meal. The portions were gigantic, but I downed the entire thing cuz I ain't no punk.   If you like delicious Caribbean food, at reasonable prices, large portions and a laid back and unpretentious atmosphere where the focus is on food rather than looks, then this place is it. I'd come back for sure and sample some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken is very very salty. Prepare to drink lots of water! We went to eat here because the jerk chicken's reviews were great but do not be deceived. However, the mango juice was better than average."}
{"text":"This place sells coco bread that you can take home! Great for jerk chicken and coleslaw sandwiches at home. The jerk chicken sandwich is a little too greasy for my liking but lots of options (jerk chicken with rice, Roti, etc). Weekday lunch specials. Service is very slow so it's worth calling ahead and ordering."}
{"text":"I was craving for Jerk Chicken and when I checked for best jerk chicken in Mississauga, Allspice was one on the list. I read the reviews on Yelp and I've decided to give it a try even if the majority is commenting on its poor customer service. As we were parking in front there was a lady standing outside Allspice talking on the phone, when she saw us getting out of the car, she went to the counter, and when we walked inside Bakery she went inside the cook area. So we rang the bell and waited and waited, rang the bell again and waited she didn't come out, we can hear her talking on the phone but she never came out. So we left and decided to go to burrito boyz accross the street."}
{"text":"My jerk chicken place of choice in Mississauga hands down. Big portions, great taste, and very fair value."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant because of the good reviews here. I was very disappointed. The jerk chicken was extremely salty as well as the rice. Won't come to this place again."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Caribbean food I've ever had! The place looks shady and it seems a tiny hole in the wall... but the flavors are so authentic and mouth wateringly delicious! Their jerk chicken is seasoned so perfectly... their oxtail is so soft and flavorful... and the goat curry has just the right spices that hits the spot. The best part? The price. You get waaaaaay more than what you pay for as compared to any other Caribbean take out places I've been to. And not just fillers too! Your plate is jampacked with meat, not just rice and coleslaw. You HAVE to try them out."}
{"text":"Super disappointing....  I should of known from the time I saw the outdated country style decor and furnishings ... Should have known when I noticed a different business name printed on the receipt ...  I should of known when the guy at the counter reassured us that the food had plenty of taste before we left ...   It was a Sunday night not to far before closing and my family and I decided to try this place out for the first time to satisfy our home cooking craving. We were hungry and wanted something that tasted like it came straight out the pot from back home but quick. Our mind was set on oxtail and jerk chicken. We arrived at the restaurant shortly after 9 pm (restaurant closed at 10). We then quickly put in our orders for 2 large oxtails and 2 large jerk chickens ... #Biggest waste of money of 2016 so far. We waited the 20 minutes for our orders... Not to sure why because the only other people there already received their order. We noticed that the gentlemen who took our orders (handled the money) was also the cook  on duty and table busser. As we waited a bit longer we started hearing the sound of a microwave go off every 5 minutes or so. Had I known I would be buying leftovers I would have just saved the 50 bucks and spent the time and  just cooked the food myself. Other factors such as touching the face and coughing contributed to my feelings toward this business.   About the food...  The meal included the protein, rice and peas and coleslaw. There was no choice for the type of  rice  which only meant he was trying to get rid of it. At fist glance you can still see the formation of spooned rice. Rice is not suppose to clump together like it did. At first \"bite\", the rice resembled rice pudding with the \"oxtail gravy\" being  the liquid. Definitely Pot bottom rice.  The coleslaw seemed okay but had a tangy aftertaste. Then I noticed him finishing up with the packaging and he shared out the coleslaw at the front counter which can only mean the mayonnaise doused side had been sitting Without refrigeration for who knows how long.  The \"oxtail\" tasted like it was cooked in a poutine beef gravy with no seasoning. There was no carrots or butter beans (which are traditional ingredients for the dish)  and the 3 pieces of bone that I received had little to no meat on it. What seemed to be a filled container was just a container fill with mushy rice and thick gravy.  The mouthfeel of the overcooked oxtail reminded me of jello.  The jerk chicken was smothered in the same \"gravy\" as the oxtail, which was probably to mask the bitter taste of the chicken. I can tell that the chicken was not cleaned properly or  marinated and just thrown into the oven. The only taste came from the gravy it was covered in.  Jerk? What jerk? The only spice that came from this restaurant was in the name. After 2 bites of chicken and rice my mother became sick almost instantly and my mom has a strong stomach so this was weird.   Maybe a visit from the health inspector is well over due because their business practices are affecting the quality of food. This review wasn't meant to bash the business but to save the unknowing patron with a craving for real food. I only came here based on the reviews which I assume is how most of you readers decide where to go. I gave one star because this was the only place open. Maybe I should open a late night pop up kitchen and show Mississauga some real Caribbean food.   Look out for my reviews! I'm on a quest to find the best Caribbean spot in peel"}
{"text":"Delicious food perfect portions I just love the jerk chicken ... I think it's the best jerk chicken in mississauga so far I highly recommend this to everyone"}
{"text":"Food was not good. Roti was dry, Extremely salty and it gave me food poisoning. I love greasy spoons but this place not only looks dingy but the food made me sick!"}
{"text":"Only really bought beef patties from this place, but the last time I was there I saw a cockroach walking around the front counter.  Usually that means there's plenty more where that came from out back.  I'm glad I've never bought anything else.  Never again visiting this place."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend after I said I wanted to try something different in Mississauga. Though it's been around for a while, it still flies under the radar, and I'm secretly impressed it's still standing. Walking in, you can still see the Tim Hortons skeleton in the furniture and wall tiles and the way the counter space and ghost-donut racks are still lingering.   But this place is delicious, and keeps their menu simple so they don't mess with what works. So what's awesome here? For $7 (Monday to Friday), they have a fantastic lunch special: jerk chicken (or curry chicken) with a massive side of rice and beans, and coleslaw. The plate is HEAPING. The jerk chicken is two drumsticks and two thighs in an amazing sauce with just the rice level of spice.   So it's a sure win in my books. The one thing that didn't pan out for us was the elusive all-spice drink. Apparently this was the third time my friend had come and each time this drink (with a big spot on the menu overhead) was not available. For $1.50, I would've loved to try it. Maybe fourth time's a charm?"}
{"text":"Went during lunch time for the lunch special jerk chicken for only 7$. Very worth it. Large portion and lots of meat. Would recommend everyone to go and try it"}
{"text":"This place looks really shabby and old however the yummiest food by far.   Their jerk chicken, coleslaw, rice and peas, chicken/dumpling soup etc is beyond delicious."}
{"text":"Had dinner there for the first time with the wife, she had the Jerk Chicken and I had the Curry Chicken.  Both dishes were very good with large portions for the price.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Under new management and unfortunately this has affected food quality as all the old staff/cooks no longer work here .  The Jerk Chicken is nothing like it used to be , very greasy and rice lacks flavors. The sauce also is nothing like the original.Sad to say Mississauga has lost a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Round Two. Oxtail anyone?   One large order to eat in please.  Now the waiting game begins.  I suffered thru the super long brain numbing four minute wait.  Can you hear the Jepordy Final Question Music in the background?  Yes Alex, I will take \"tasty animal appendages\" for .......    Back to reality.  Finally my food showed up. My goodness. Four minutes!  I should have Complained but I started with Pepper sauce drops all over my plate.  Chips B likes it spicy. The pepper sauce here isn't too hot but compliments the food nicely. The tail of the ox was cooked to fall and suck off the bone deliciousness. (Don't go there people.... Don't. )  I found the gravy a wee bit oily but that did not deter me from this battle of my senses.  I ended up washing the dish down with a bowl of their yummy chicken soup.   My verdict.  I would have given this dish a Five Star rating but due to the huge scrumptious portions of Oxtail, Rice and Pee and Coleslaw (I am talking like enough food to feed three hungry skinny people) this dish shall receive a star rating of Four.  Don't get me started on the four minute wait time. Don't.  And Yes I am PMS'g today. I don't know what that means but I am.   I've read that line a couple of times here in Yelp Land.  I am a biter.  Lol.  Salute my fellow Yelpers. Happy eating."}
{"text":"Best Jamaican food in the GTA. Not the best place to eat (a little shabby), but the food more than makes up for it. Great place for lunch or for dinner take out (what I usually do) Oxtail, curry goat, and the Jerk Chicken are my three go to items. If I'm taking out I usually get one of each for my girlfriend and I to share. All dishes come with rice and super tasty coleslaw.   Owner and staff are also very nice and appreciate of the business. He knows me well no so is always giving me a little something extra ;)  Food is a 5 star ( this is why I'm giving them a 5)"}
{"text":"The food here is Amazing! HUGE portions! Amazing Jerk Chicken and Curry goat! This place never disappoints.   Don't let the look of this place turn you away. (I think it used to be a Coffee Time).  Sooooooooo good."}
{"text":"I got the Jerk chicken with Rice. The gravy was nothing spectacular at all. I found it extremely salty and felt as if the gravy was some store bought gravy. Been to much better jerk chicken places before."}
{"text":"Awesome Awesome low key carribean cafe eatery, the location is not all that great, its like a older type of cafe, however the food and value is where its at. They sell coffee and special carribean pastries but most people come here for the food.   I got the small jerk chicken dinner which has rice and peas with coleslaw and gravy. The portions are huge and very tasty. Might i add also that it is tad bit spicy. You get so much chicken its insane...i can only imagine how big the large jerk chicken dinner would be lol. They have all types of carribean food besides jerk chicken like Ackee salt fish, curry chicken, Snapper dinner, curry fish and more. The jerk chicken meal was a great value its definately worth trying if you're into jerk chicken. Also something else to keep in mind, The price you pay here is probably less then where you would pay anywhere else too, for the small jerk chicken meal was $7.50 and large is $8.50"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time in a long time... it's under new management and things are changing... when I went in they were still renovating... and it's looking a lot nicer. The decor before was pretty dated (mid 90s?) and could be described as a mix between a 'coffee style' donut shop and the boys department at sears department store with 800 pound CRT TVs mounted on the wall. Nonetheless the food was consistently good. Food quality hasn't changed under new management the food was authentic and the portions were on point and the coleslaw was good too. The Beefpatty was good just as I remembered them. I think they are changing the name of the store but can't remember what it was as the new signage was still limited and in the process of being put up."}
{"text":"Best Jerk chicken in Ontario hands down. Better than 90% of the spots in Jamaica.  There is simply no better,"}
{"text":"Atmosphere:  '80s donut shop with fake flowers in the laminate planters and random posters from a shutdown travel agency.  They ad hocked the same menu boards by printing out items and placing them in the 'slots'.  There is also a hand-written whiteboard with the more popular items.  Food:  I ordered a Jerk Chicken Roti ($8.50) and it took about 10mins to arrive.  It also came with a creamy coleslaw on the side which was a nice touch to counter the Jerk Chicken.  Chicken itself was moist and roti was fluffy.  One of the 'lightest' tasting rotis that I've had in the city - usually, I find them super heavy, a bit greasy, and always, always, ALWAYS contain too many lashings on salt.  However, this one wasn't overly salted!  I wished that I had asked for a spicy sauce to enhance my experience.  Depending on your hunger level, size of roti was definitely shareable between 2 people.  I wouldn't hesitate to stop by again and try other things on their menu.  Again, don't let their outdated décor prevent you from stopping by!"}
{"text":"Very tasty carry out jerk chicken with rice and peas and coleslaw. The serving of chicken was very generous, especially since I ordered a small dish. The chicken was delicious, as was the rice. The coleslaw was perfect.  I came across this restaurant by chance, and what a great find. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Good jerk chicken. This place looks like a dump but man the food taste great. BIG portions and very reasonably priced.   Chicken is always moist, fully flavored and more often then not the skin is crispy. Although I am not Jamaican I'm pretty sure the jerk isn't authentic but nonetheless it taste amazing.   They serve it with a lot of gravy so it isn't the standard dry jerk some of us are used to.    I cannot comment on any other dish but the jerk chicken is to die for.    I didn't give it a 5 because the actual cafe is dated to say the least.   Did I mention the jerk chicken is good?"}
{"text":"Don't let the look of this restaurant fool you, this place is hidden gem in Mississauga. All dishes are Halal except the beef & chicken patties. My friends & I are regulars here & have tried the Jerk Chicken, Curry Goat, Oxtail, Goat Roti, Stew Chicken & even Jerk Chicken Wings!   All I can say is, this place has good quality, quantity in servings & consistency in flavor. Try this place out you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Best Jerk Chicken in all Ontario! Always moist and very tasty. This store sells other delicious Trini style roti and curries which are equally good. I have ordered party trays of  jerk from there. Food is always consistently fresh and tasty with great service. Don't expect a upscale sit down restaurant but rather a homey sit down  fast food place worthy of the money and your travel."}
{"text":"Not entirely sure what all the excellent reviews are about. The service is good and the food comes fast. The lunch and price and portion is really fair as well which is nice. I ate a beef patty while I waited for my jerk lunch and if the review stopped here I would give it 4 or 5 stars because the patty was great. the chicken and coleslaw was okay but the gravy ruined my meal. it tasted like bisto gravy made from a box and I don't know how fresh the rice was. The gravy was overwhelmingly bad and ended up ruining my meal because I couldn't stand the taste of it. However if your not fussy and want a ton of food that doesn't taste like Jamaican jerk chicken this is a good spot."}
{"text":"Thomas (the owner). : a legendary king who is given the power of turning everything he touches to gold."}
{"text":"I love this place.  In fact, I'd rank it above Leela's next door. No disrespect, of course.  They have a great lunch special for jerk. The jerk is very good, flavourful. Also the curried goat is amazing.  Try it."}
{"text":"I come here regularly and bring many of my friends and everyone loves it. I always get the jerk chicken which is best!! For the less spicy people their curry chicken is really good too. Best fall off the bone chicken I can't believe it. From the passionate and friendly people that work there to the amazing taste of their home made food this place has become a regular of mine. They all remember my order every time and their food is never ever disappointing. I've been to many Caribbean places around Toronto and Mississauga but I always come back to this one. Their portions are huge and they have special pricing for lunch. I don't think any place deserves my money more than this one. Don't be fooled by its decor, the food makes up for it. 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"The BEST caribbean food I've ever had. Been there about a dozen times now and they quality is superb each time. The owner, Thomas is one of the friendliest guys around.  Highly recommended. The best dish - Octail curry - simply heaven!"}
