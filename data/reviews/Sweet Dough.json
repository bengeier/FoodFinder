{"text":"My husband and I got the maple glazed with chocolate drizzle, strawberry glazed cake, croissant donut and lemon filled.  We sat and ate the first three.  These are not overly sweet donuts.  We both loved that!  The glazes provided enough sweetness to the cake.  It has been over an hour since we had them and we don't have that sugar high you might get from eating a couple Krispy Kreme donuts.  Everyone is going to have different tastes and likes.  We will definitely go back because 1) We loved our donut choices and look forward to trying others 2) Staff was very friendly 3) We love supporting local businesses with great food and service so we don't have to drive far."}
{"text":"Best breakfast sweets in Fort Mill. Love the staff. So friendly and helpful. Great concept, creating your own doughnuts. Check them out, you will return. Again and again."}
{"text":"Stopped by Sweet Dough this morning to pick up some donuts!  Before going there I checked out their website and noticed they had a create your own donut, very similar to Duck Donuts (hate to compare, but I love DD).  So I came into Sweet Dough to order a dozen create your own donuts.  They had a case of donuts already made so you don't have to be overwhelmed with creating your own.   The staff was friendly, but they seemed alarmed and excited at the same time that I wanted to create my own dozen.  I got donuts from maple bacon, peanut butter and chocolate, lemon strawberry, vanilla cookies and cream, to chocolate caramel glaze.  I brought them to our office and they were well liked.  I have to say though, after having Duck Donuts with a similar setup, they are far inferior to Duck (a coworker agreed).  I am not a fan of cake Donuts, but Duck and Sweet Dough have cake based donuts.  I don't like cake because of that sticky top of the mouth after taste.  Duck's does not have that after taste, Sweet Dough does.  -1.   With toppings, Duck has it plentiful - example, the maple bacon, bacon is covering the donut fully.  Here, couple scattered about.  -2.  +1 for being local donut shop, +1 for all of the options, +1 for friendly fun staff.  It was fun to check out, but honestly, I would rather drive out the way for Duck in Charlotte or on my side of Fort Mill, I'm close to Rise for a close donut craving.    Best of luck to Sweet Dough!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing donuts and apple fritters.  They also have an awesome strawberry and cream croissant. The staff is wonderful! It's a sweet family that run it together.  I enjoy visiting with them whenever I go in.  The donuts are unique and delicious.  You can make your own creation too.  (Like Duck Donuts) just ask them and they will make it with the icing and toppings they have.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is so incredible I don't know where to start. The service is top notch, some of the friendliest people you could ask for. The doughnuts are delicious. We frequent sweet dough often"}
{"text":"Great doughnuts and great service! The employees were very kind and talkative, and even gave us a free doughnut. In addition, the chocolate frosting is amazing."}
{"text":"OMG that was great! Super friendly awesome staff will fill any doughnut you want with any of their options. Got the maple long John filled (1/2 whipped cream and 1/2 icing). Their icing filling is not over sweet grainy like Krispy Kreme. The strawberries and cream croissant had a light icing glaze was SO good. Definitely making a return trip!  2 doughnuts and 1 milk only $6.24"}
{"text":"I was so excited about this place opening. I went there one of the first few days bright and early to bring donuts to work for my team. The place was nice, nothing over the top but a basic donut shop. The menu looked pretty extensive but I was only in the market for some donuts. I got a bakers dozen of assorted donuts.  I had a cinnamon donut and my husband had jelly, we both felt it was a bit underwhelming. I mad at myself for saying it but it's true. There were just OK. I was looking for a mouth watering, extra soft and as large as my head donut. It just wasn't. Everyone was really nice and super friendly... after all it was opening week. We will definitely try it again, sometimes it's that opening jitters.   Come on, let me love you."}
{"text":"What a great place to get some breakfast. They have everything your heart can desire from coffee to donuts to breakfast sandwiches. Their service was absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"The strawberry doughnut is incredible!  I've been here multiple times and quality has been consistent with each visit.  Both the yeast and cake doughnuts are amazing!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© LOVED his breakfast burrito and I was a big fan of the make-your-own donut! The ambience is the best you can do for being in a strip mall. Hidden gem. Yum!!"}
{"text":"There are a couple of places in Fort Mill to get you sweet fix on, but sometimes you get tired of cupcakes and cakes. You want something different that does great with a good cup of coffee and still rewards your sweet tooth.  Not too long ago I heard of the donut shop opening in Ft. Mill and wanted to try it out so I took the family and we ventured to Sweet Dough. It's a small sized bakery with big time customer service and sweet treats.  Obviously one would want to compare these donuts to bigger chain spots, but Sweet Dough has exceeded my expectations and my perception of what donuts are supposed to be. The donuts are always fresh and there are many varieties to choose from but you can get creative and add your own toppings to your donuts. If you're not in the mood for donuts that's fine because Sweet Dough as serves breakfast with a nice selection to choose from.  As always, my biggest issues to focus on are cleanliness, customer service and quality; Sweet Dough doesn't disappoint and their hardwork and dedication prove it. Lastly, their hours are from 6am to 2pm everyday so keep that in mind when visiting. Definitely support this small business, they deserve your patronage!"}
{"text":"Finally, Fort Mill has a donut shop!! Sweet Dough picked a great space outside of the Walmart Market in Old Town, Fort Mill. It's a new building and the Sweet Dough staff appreciates it. They maintain a higher standard of cleanliness than many other bakeries I've visited. All staff members wear gloves when handling food products and keep aprons on at all times. Being able to see the whole team working on creating the dough masterpieces, is always a great way to determine the real dedication behind the food.  The donuts are a bakery quality, too. You can tell they aren't mass produced and a corporate dough was just 'baked' in house. They take their time with each cream filled donut, ensuring there is a decent space for the cream by carefully puncturing one side and not driving a stake through the whole donut. I appreciate the ability to be creative yet stocking the case with delicious classics. Sometimes, you might want a vanilla dipped, Oreo sprinkled, caramel drizzled donut and other times the glazed croissant is just crazy enough for the day.   Honestly, very glad to have Sweet Dough join the Fort Mill community. I hope they have been welcomed with open arms as well as they have opened their arms to this town."}
{"text":"Doughnuts have obviously made recent comeback and finally Fort Mill joins the party. I stopped in and got half a dozen doughnuts from the case. To clarify a previous review, Sweet Dough does have yeast doughnuts, and the majority of them are yeast and not cake doughnuts. Five of my doughnuts were yeast and one was cake.   Everything was good, although I will agree they are nothing outstanding like Sugar Donuts in Ballantyne. However, they were definitely way better than the places that have their product shipped in on trucks. The people working were very friendly. Prices were also reasonable - $1.25 for a fresh doughnut is not bad. They also serve breakfast biscuits and sandwiches until 10:30 so I will sample those.  Overall, this is a great addition to Fort Mill. If it was far away, I would probably not make a special trip for it, but it is definitely worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Sweet dough has donuts, muffins, breakfast burritos and breakfast sandwiches. Staff is super friendly. This is just the kind of place Fort Mill needs, local and family owned. Shop is very bright and open. My son loved being able to see the donuts be made. I can't wait to try more of what they offer"}
{"text":"Delicious little doughnut shop! So happy that there is finally one in Fort Mill. Staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This was the first time visiting Sweet Dough and I will definitely be back!!! They were super friendly and inviting when I walked in! The cinnamon roll was perfect and apple fritter was the best hands down!  As a small business owner myself I will recommend this place to everyone else I know!"}
{"text":"the croissant donuts are incomparable. i don't even like donuts but i think about these all of the time. our whole department is addicted. my only complaint is that there isn't a location closer to my house in the downtown charlotte area."}
{"text":"These doughnuts are great!  Contrary to what someone else wrote, these are NOT cake doughnuts - they are light and airy yeast with a really good flavor.  I like the \"create your own\" concept first brought to this area by Duck Donuts, but Duck's actual doughnut is not very tasty - Sweet Dough's IS!  I took an assorted dozen to a recent function to rave reviews.  The peanut butter banana long john is fantastic, and their cinnamon rolls are excellent, but I think the maple frosted is my personal favorite."}
{"text":"Make your own donut!!! Stopped here for a reward for my awesome kids!  Cream filled- chocolate glazed cream filled.   Overall a good fresh donut!  My kids made their own: How to Make your own-  pick cake or regular donut  Pick a Glaze Pick a Topping  And pick your syrup"}
{"text":"Easily the best donuts in Fort Mill! I love the variety they have. The service is also fantastic here!"}
{"text":"I love this place with all my heart. it was the first time that me and my friends came to sourdough to eat it's honestly one of the best places I've ever been. the service was outstanding and I got my food in the nick of time. I got the chocolate donut with rainbow sprinkles to represent my gayness that nobody seems to except but you know what? sourdough did. The doughnut was only $14 and sandwich was 15 what a bargain! all of the customers here are very studious and intelligent. The only downside about the restaurant is that there's not enough seating I had to sit on the bathroom toilet :( god please give these people chairs. god bless america. i love sweet dough!"}
{"text":"Amazing tasting donuts and wonderful employees! There is virtually no wait and the prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Delicious little treats. My brother doesn't like apple fritters but he tried one from here and had to know where I got it."}
{"text":"My 12 year old exclaimed, \"That was the best donut I've ever eaten!\" And he said it three times! I think that pretty much sums up how all six of us felt. I really like that we were able to eat breakfast there before having our treats. I had the burrito supreme with sausage and it was much larger than I expected and very tasty. The rest of my family had croissant sandwiches and were also pleased. I also had the banana peanut butter long John, which was amazing! The donuts were obviously made fresh this morning. The filling was a delightful blend of frosting, peanut butter and fresh banana. It had a chocolate glaze and peanut butter drizzle over the top with some dried banana pieces for crunch. Hubby had a Boston Cream style donut. They don't skimp on the filling that's for sure! The staff was friendly & patient as we made our selections."}
{"text":"I love this donut shop.  The donuts are delicious.  Service is awesome. Highly recommend. A must try this location."}
{"text":"These donuts are great! I have gone twice now to try out multiple items on the menu to get a feel as to what is good here. I tried the apple fritter, maple bacon, strawberry and cream croissant donut, and chocolate custard or cream filled (don't really know which one it was). All of which were great. Came in for my first visit and they were out of a lot and found out that they make fresh to order and so I got a few like that. The donuts are good. They are the best local donuts near where I live so I don't have to drive far. I think I enjoyed the cream filled one the most. The fritter was a bit to doughy to my liking. I'm more of a crisp fritter kind of guy. But all that to say that you should try this place out since they are new in town and it is good here. I also will try their breakfast at some point."}
{"text":"Ended up coming here with my wife and daughter a few weeks ago. Everyone that worked there was super nice and it was cool to see donuts being made behind the counter. That way you know it's fresh. We ordered a few plain glazed donuts and also got one of the Apple Fritters. I know a good donut when I see one and man were they GOOD!  Ended up talking to the owner afterwards and found out that I used to play basketball with him ~10yrs ago at my old gym. I then told him everything was delicious and next time would be trying the bacon topped maple donut. He then picked one out for me and gave it to me complimentary. Kindness goes a long way and for that I hope this business does well forever. Nice job!"}
{"text":"Fresh donuts. Good hot coffee. Breakfast sandwiches and very reasonable and tasty. Would recommend this for family. Staff is friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Gave Sweet Dough a visit this morning and was impressed with their selection...even though it was 10:45. I knew me and my family wouldn't be satisfied with the standard dozen, so we got a mix of regular and premium donuts, eclairs and fritters. They were all EXCEPTIONAL! My favorite was the chocolate-iced BOSTON cream-filled and the banana and peanut butter eclair. It had real banana cream and banana chips atop the chocolate icing with a ribbon of peanut butter. It was a doughnut that would've made Elvis proud. Not exactly cheap for the dozen mixed, $20, but weLl worth it after the taste-testing. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today this afternoon not realizing that they closed at 2 and they kindly let me buy a couple donuts because I'd been looking forward to them opening.  Wow, these people are great and the donuts are amazing!  Can't wait to try the rest of their food!"}
{"text":"Super friendly, delicious local alternative to the usual fast food type donut shop.  Will be back!"}
