{"text":"Great food and service. Spinach enchiladas are my favorite. Beer is ice cold"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place one Sunday afternoon and loved it! We had the shrimp quesadilla for a happy hour appetizer and it was so cheesy and yummy. The shrimp were big and juicy. The shrimp tacos were great too. Loved the refried beans that came with the tacos. Even the endless chips and salsa were amazing. Had a glass of Mexican white Zinfandel for the first time on their happy hour menu and my husband had a beer. Service was wonderful. We will definitely be back. The place is really cute."}
{"text":"As others have said, wait staff is rude (actually I thought the man was good, but the young female had poor attitude), food appears made from frozen or canned, bland, and salsas aren't nearly as good as the former business that was here (Ketzal). But wait, there's more ...  My wife and I came here on a Friday night at 9:30pm. Place closes at 10pm on Friday and Saturday, and we know and respect that... but the waitress rushed us to order, failed to attend to our drinks, and rushed us with the bill. Mind you, we've come here late when it was Ketzal and they never gave us attitude or rushed us out.  After a long week of work, all I wanted to do was take my wife out for a relaxing dinner. Instead, I complained that the waitress was unfriendly and the owner came out to confront me in a hostile manner. It shocked me because every time I've ever complained at any other restaurant (few and far between), the owner always asks what could've been done better. Instead, the owner (or manager - not sure) came out and started yelling at me, telling me to \"get the hell out,\" flipped me off. My wife observed the entire event and called the Phoenix police because she thought the guy was going to strike me. Police said there was nothing they could do unless he touched me, which he did not. He only verbally assaulted me. Funny, I never used a curse word or flipped him off because there was no reason to. I simply said I wanted better service for the $20 we paid and expected friendliness and not to be rushed out the door. I never expected to stay past their door closing time.  You may think this is nuts and I must have provoked him. Well, if you consider that on the check I reduced the waitress' tip and write on the back \"We were rushed out and will never return\" then maybe I deserved it. Just consider this - if you pay good money for a relaxing experience and get awful service, do you have to keep your mouth shut or do you have a right to complain? I think this was completely nuts. I still can't believe what happened. I've never seen an owner or manager that hostile about a customer complaint. Unreal.  Support such hostile local business at your own discretion. And if you do, don't ever go at 9:30pm on a Friday or Saturday. Highly disappointed. Ketzal... COME BACK! Their staff never disappointed, not even near closing time.  I'd give them two stars (one extra just for their nice interior), but the experience was unlike any I have ever had. I am a fairly big guy and I actually had to prepare to physically defend myself against this little hostile man."}
{"text":"we have been back several times since my last review, and the service has greatly improved.  Food is really solid, and if you go from 3-6pm, you get 1/2 price margaritas.  And they are strong!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy - just great food & the service is the best - friendly and spot on - this will be one of my regular places"}
{"text":"We wanted something quick for an early dinner and found this cute restaurant. Although we had to wait a while to get seated (short staffed maybe), we had our chips, salsa, and drinks in no time. The salsa was really hot so we had to ask for a mild. Hubby had the tacos and I had the combo two (gotta get my enchilada on...and a tostada). HUGE plates and muy muy Delicious! Very friendly staff! :)"}
{"text":"We has the chicken Chimichanga and chicken Caesar salad both were very tasty!  Tried the peach, house and Tamarindo margaritas....yum! Service was awesome...very attentive!"}
{"text":"One and DONE! Called in a take out order and I should have followed my first impression. The person who answered the phone didn't identify the restaurant by name, took my order and name, said \"10 minutes\" and hung up.  No \"thank you\" or \"your total will be ...\".   Ordered 3 beef tacos which were OK... Far from great.  Also ordered the beef chimichanga meal w refried beans and rice.  The chimi was packaged in a Styrofoam container and covered w lettuce, guacamole and sour cream.  It was inedible as it was soggy after a 10 minute trip home.  In fairness, maybe it would have been better if I had eaten at the restaurant.  The refried bean were very runny and also inedible. Hopefully your experience will be better."}
{"text":"A must go to place to visit!  Warm welcome, great service and amazing authentic food!  Nachos with black beans, chicken and fresh tomato and onion!  Yum!  You must visit the next time you have a taste for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Our server was friendly and helpful. She recommended the chicken fajitas for my husband and I, which were amazing. It was very fairly priced and a very nice and comfortable atmosphere. We will definitely be back, this is our new favorite Mexican restaurant. I can't wait to try more menu options!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times for pick-up orders and their burritos are fantastic. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant. We go here once a week. We are originally from Southern Colorado and there is a restaurant in our home town called 3 Margaritas---turns out--- same family as Plaza Bonita! We love the Burrito Colorado, the Carnitas, really everything. It's consistently good and fast."}
{"text":"Best Fish Taco's anywhere! My husband and I love Plaze Bonita. The food and service are always consistent and good."}
{"text":"Finally, I made it for lunch at this new place.  According to our waitress, it has only been open for less than 2 weeks.  The outside was updated with a new paint.  However, much of the decor from the previous restaurant in this location (3 Margaritas) has been retained with slight structural changes on the inside. The decor is odd in that the booths have an old floral pattern and all the tables and chairs are painted with a \"mexican\" theme... definitely a mismatch in styles.  I ordered their chimichanga lunch special (meat option was chicken, beef or shredded beef) and my dining companion ordered the \"mexican style\" plate.  The service was good and the food fresh.  It's hard not to compare it to the previous restaurant since it should be judged on its own merits.  Actually, I found the food to be better... which translates to less grease, fresher ingredients.  The chips were also fresh and the salsa spicy and tasty enough to keep feeding your face while waiting for your entree.  Overall, a good restaurant with decent Mexican food.  I will definitely return due to its food and convenient location."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite eating places in my local neighborhood the chile verde is killer service is good and it's always busy , well prepared well presented and efficient service !!"}
{"text":"Great lunch. My wife and I took our two young children at about 11:30 on  Saturday morning. The place was very clean and the staff was very accommodating. The staff was playing with our children and provided them with coloring books.   The food was awesome. My wife and I shared the nachos. The portions were huge. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"It's average. Prices on high end for mexican food, drinks pretty high too. Well drinks are tiny and pricey. Food is good."}
{"text":"Terrible service and the food isn't much better! Thought we would try something new, but big mistake. Next time we will go to Manuels on Bell Rd."}
{"text":"The family and I had our first visit to PB this evening. We enjoyed quick seating and friendly service. The decor is bright and colorful, the food was fantastic, authentic Mexican and the beer was ice cold. Yum!  I'm a native Phoenician and a salsa snob! Minus one star in my rating because the salsa was a bit on the bland side this evening. The mild sauce was flavorless, watery tomato sauce. The 'spicy' version of their salsa sported a few more chunks of onion and green chilli, and overall had a better flavor. Chips were thicker than I like them, but that didn't slow me down from shoving them in my mouth! Refills were prompt.  I'm definitely going back to PB in the near future!"}
{"text":"Every time we've been to Plaza Bonita (PB as it's now known) we've enjoyed ourselves. The staff is so nice and makes you feel welcome. The food comes out hot, quick, and fresh. The camarones mexicanos is one of my favorite dishes as is the healthy chicken burrito. I love the vegetables they fill it with. My boyfriend has a combo platter with a chile relleno, tamale, and enchilada. All were fantastic!! And that's coming from a Mexican woman who makes tamales every year for Christmas.   One of our favorite things about this place of course are the margaritas!! I think we've tried every one of them two times over...not sure what that says about us, but...  We also love the colorful decor of the place, it really reminds me of Jalisco, Mexico. Some people may disagree but I wish they'd play music, at least during the evenings and on weekends. We're so happy a place like this has come to our neck of the woods!"}
{"text":"Awesome. We went their second night open and both service and food were great! Love the decorations.  We thought that the prices were good too and the margs were better than average.  It is a very good family restaurant.  At our table we had shrimp, fish and burrito and they didn't stand a chance, everything was devoured!"}
{"text":"The decor is mismatched, but the place is comfortable and they have wi- fi. The food  is delicious from the chips and spicy salsa to the fantastic chicken enchiladas to the yummy machaca chimichangas...if you love a well made margarita, try their Perfect Margarita: Don Julio, Cointreau. Gran Marnier, triple sec and lime... Hand shaken... the best!"}
{"text":"If you are craving some authentic mexican, go to Plaza Bonita! We went late on a tuesday and they were busy - always a good sign. Sat at the bar, and had easy conversation with the bartender Gracie (she turned out to be one of owners).   The chips were warm and tasted homemade. Salsa is thin, but had a nice little kick to it. She even brought out a free bean dip for us to try while we waited for our food.  I ordered the snapper veracruz and it was delicious. Huge portion of snapper, covered in a seasoned tomato sauce with diced potatoes in it. My husband got the tacos carbon. I love that they came topped with cotija cheese, and I kept sneaking bits of the steak off his plate when he was distracted. Yummy! Both dishes came out so hot we could barely eat them right away. Hot food, not just a warmed plate :)   I can't think of anything I didn't like. The decor is bright, but not gaudy. Gracie even mentioned that they have a ton of orders for their barstools and benches!"}
{"text":"The food is real good here. Friendly service, and large bar. Worth it."}
{"text":"We had a great experience. It was exactly what my wife and I were looking for. Some good Mexican food and a margarita after shopping at the outlets in Anthem. We weren't looking for a major gourmet affair, just somewhere to stop on the ride back and we were pleasantly surprised. The service was awesome and it seemed very family oriented. I had the carne asada and it was really flavorful. My wife had the delux burrito and she enjoyed it as well. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The food is great so good but this new manager the very short guy is asshole so make sure don't get him...the owner is nice and the lady at front is grate...be aware of tha guy...he's not my server when I go there he doesn't know how to work with costumers.."}
{"text":"Good food for a really reasonable price... the chips were home made and the burritos are HUGE.. loved the sides as well with the beans and rice!  For a nice change these were good here.   Service could be much better since they were not busy when we were there but they were more interested in talking in the corner.  But the food was worth the wait!   The margarita's are good as well - would have had more if we were asked!  Which was probably a good thing!  LOL"}
{"text":"Plaza Bonita definitely surprised me, I had read the reviews here on yelp but even then I had my doubts. Its a very intimate setting, it reminds me of being in Mexico. The staff are very friendly, they call you Amigo which I thought was funny. The staff could be a bit more organized we couldn't find our waiter for a good 15 minutes. Besides all that the food is phenomenal!!! I ordered the Pollo Fundido and Jack got the Steak Fajitas, the food came out steaming hot! We had to wait a few minutes to eat it, it was so hot lol. The Pollo Fundido was creamy, and the chicken perfectly cooked not dry at all, the Steak Fajitas were bomb, the steak wasn't chewy or over spiced, and the tortillas were perfect. Oh and their guacamole is made in house and its beyond tastey. I definitely will be coming back to Plaza Bonita in the near future, be sure to order a side of ranch with the tortilla chips. I know it sounds weird but its super good to dip the chips in. As for their margaritas WOW! Felt like I was back in Rocky Point on the beach! Strong but good and very decent priced. :) Got a nice buzz off of one!"}
{"text":"Wow, for a little place, the Mexican food was fantastic. Didn't expect much but it is a true Mexican restaurant. I always try the Pollo fundido everywhere I go and this one was lightly breaded with an awesome sauce that was super sweet. We really enjoyed our experience there and we'll be back."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food. This place is a quaint little restaurant just off Care Free Highway. The parking lot kinda sucks, but that would be the only draw back. I like the way the place is decorated, and each booth or table is unique. The food is delicious. The wait staff is among the most friendly I have seen. I have tried the tortilla soup (one of my favorite dishes). It is lighter and fresher than I am used to...very yummy. I also had the carne asada which was very tender and tasty. There are a variety of margaritas, of which I have tried 2. One was spicy, which I had never tried before, I was not a fan. The other was perfect. Nice little place for a relaxing meal and drinks."}
{"text":"Great service, awesome decor, fun music. Food was the best Mexican I've had around here. Fajitas were plentiful and sizzling with masses of accoutrements. Friends had other dishes and combos -they all looked and tasted great. Will definitely return"}
{"text":"I love Plaza Bonita!! I eat there nearly once a week. I recommend Camerones Mexicanos and a Cadillac Margarita."}
{"text":"First time here maybe we ordered the wrong dishes. Fish tacos, carne plate, quesadilla, fish tacos. Not great but will give it another shot. Maybe. Nice staff cute ambulance. Quesadilla was good!  Fish tacos not the norm (w/o cabbage, corn tortillas). Carne taste like liver. Beans are a bit spicy. Rice was good."}
{"text":"We have been to Plaza Bonita many times. Of the last year the quality of the food has really went down. The portions are probably went down. However the prices have went up. We quit going to the Plaza Bonita and less we are maybe just stopping in for a couple of margaritas. Just not the same place that used to be in my opinion."}
{"text":"I've been to the Plaza Bonita up in Prescott and got the Roupa Vieja salad almost every time, so good! Almost as good as how my mom makes it! And we love this location too. The burrito loco is great, and my wife loves the enchiladas! Prices are $10-15. Be prepared to wait to be seated if you show up mid dinner. It's popular!!"}
{"text":"I thought the portions were too small for the price.  Wasn't really impressed with the chimichanga that I ordered at all.  The salsa was good, as was the Bud Light."}
{"text":"Excellent service! I have been here several times and each time the food has been fantastic.  I also judge Mexican restaurants on their salsa, and theirs is GREAT!  The servers are all very attentive, quick, and friendly!  I recommend Plaza Bonita to everyone who loves Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot do to there hot salsa is hot and tons of flavor you can tell that there make it there not from a can I had the fajita they weren't the best I ever had but they where very tasty cook with just a little pink the veggies weren't  Burt like you vet from some places they service was good drinks where always full they brought chips with out asking so reply didn't need to wait for anything there churos had to. e the worst I ever had no cinnamon or sugar they where filled with cream witch was OK but I like no filling  I be back soon not form churos"}
{"text":"Decent independent Mexican place. I like the Burrito Loco. Ask them for the green sauce with your chips - great spice! Nothing super special about anything, but in looking at the other reviews I wanted to give them a thumbs up / 4 stars. For its location and quality of food and service, I think that's a solid rating."}
{"text":"I ordered a three plate meal with a burrito, taco, and a tamale. Not only were all 3 delicious, but it was enough food to last me 2 full meals. I ordered the food for take out, so I don't really know how the in house service is, but the take out service was very fast and friendly. I will definitely be going back in the future as it was really good food (and a lot of it) for a fair price."}
{"text":"Very clean and the staff is wonderful, but that's whee the good news ends. We have been there twice just to make sure. We had a different dish on each visit and sampled each others dish as well. So four different dishes on two visits and not one of them had any flavor in any item. The food is bland and of low quality. They wouldn't even be good at half the price. This was a waste of our time and money."}
{"text":"Omg. This is the best place in town.  We are regular there.  The kids love it.  They are friendly and service great.   Drinks are yummy too.   Kids favorite is the fried ice cream.  The pollo azado burrito(spelling) is to die for.   10 stars"}
{"text":"Really good food.  Salsa has good flavor. Friendly staff.  There were 6 kids & 4 adults in our group & all of us were really happy with our order...maybe because we were all starving!?  We will def go back!"}
{"text":"What a find!  Can't think of anything to improve about this place. The decor is festive, the service is friendly and very attentive, but best of all is the food. The food is fantastic!  This is our third visit and the food continues to amaze. The best Mexican Food we have had. All this located in a small strip mall located on Carefree Highway just off of I-17. I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place based on Yelp reviews.  Very clean. Good service good food.  The salsa is nice and spicy.  Good portion sizes.  We had the happy hour margaritas not bad for $3.99.  They kept refilling our water and chips and Request for tortillas.  Food  was tasty.  Nice full Bar with the games playing quietly in background.  Cantina style."}
{"text":"After 4 visits I decided to add my 3cents worth of review. Having spent a considerable time in Mexico I was very surprised to find a Mexican restaurant that reminded me of the fantastic food I have had through out mexico. They actually have sopapillas (sp) on the menu!!! This place is worth a visit. It is a bit small but prices are reasonable and the food has always been excellent. A couple of things... they don't offer coffee... too authentic??? The other is that the service has never been as good as the food. This recent visit was no different with our having to wait for a desert while the other was served...not good. Reason given...cook was very busy... that doesn't cut it. It is a management problem more than a cook problem. That's why the 4 stars... I still recommend them over all the  multiple Mexican restaurants I have visited in north Phoenix.  When you go look forward to stellar food - not stellar service. Hopefully they will work on the management issues... I still look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Yummy fajita burro and chips and salsa. Better than a lot of Mexican restaurants!! Wish the person taking my order spoke better English. Sounds mean but my order was wrong and more than I wanted to pay. It was frustrating ordering. That's the reason for 3 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite on a late Saturday afternoon.  Place was pretty empty.  We asked the waitress what the, \"signature\" dish was, since this place was promoted as a, \"family\" restaurant, grandma's recipe had to be attached to something right?  The waitress said she had only been there a short while and she didn't eat the food there anyway, so she had nothing to recommend.  She didn't seem like she really cared about being there or taking our order.  Not a good for business for sure!  So we just ordered a combo platter and a burrito. The chips and salsa that were delivered to us were sad at best,  the chips were GREASY, super greasy with a hint of rancid, like they over used the oil or did a poor job cleaning the fryer.  The salsa had good flavor, but was severely watered down.  The food came and the portions were generous, but all very flavorless.  The sauces were again, watered down, and all the meat tasted the same.  My taco was dripping in grease.  I honesty don't know how they are still open.  This place was ok,  I wouldn't go back.  Maybe if the waitress had some kind of personality, we could have overlooked some of the flaws and given the place a second chance."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with my wife. Waited 5 minutes for waitress and had to waive her down. Got zero welcome, no drink refills, and average food. Told waiter we would not be back and was told thank you and walked away. Other couples entered after us and they were greeted with smiles and customer service. Left confused and unhappy. A simple apology goes a long way."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for the last 4 years and I have never been treated so poorly in a long time while sitting at the bar and being ignored for such a long period of time. All we got was our first drink and not even asked if we would like a menu. Even the gentleman beside me was commenting on the service and he even said he ha been coming for a while now. And than finding out the woman behind the bar serving is actually the \"owner\" made the experience even worse for me. And being a business owner myself you should never treat your customers or even actual regulars that way. Even asking for silverware and napkins and the owner says \"look behind you and get them\" does not fly with me. The food as always been just OK. This review may not make a difference of people not going there or myself making an impact going back. But I wish the establishment the best of luck because I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome service, food was pretty good, drinks weren't watered down, n price was worth it."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not great. Just good enough.   The thing of just being good enough is that people won't keep coming back. Me included. I would be willing to go give it another try, but wouldn't take family from out of town as an example of GREAT Mexican food."}
{"text":"I was dubious about going here because the previous inhabitant (Ketzal) was so terrible.  However, I'm pleased to report that it has made a great recovery!  The decor in this place is BRIGHT.  Bring your shades and perhaps wear black and white so you can look at something else occasionally.    Contrary to other reviews, I thought the salsa was delicious.  It was just spicy enough and the chips were clearly made in house.  Both husband and I were pleased with our meals and we will definitely be back.  It's great to have a Mexican place in the area.  (I know that technically El Encanto Dos in \"in the area\" and in fact, I live a mile from it but putting gobs of orange cheese on things does not make it ethnic or appetizing in any way.)"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I went for dinner last night. We were seated after a short wait, the service was very friendly but the food, unfortunately was mediocre. The salad had an odd taste to it and the shrimp enchilada was extremely salty. The apples in the dessert tasted as if they had been previously frozen and the ingredients overall didn't seem to be the best quality. It's not the most expensive place but not the cheapest either. I've had better for less. Also we both woke up with tummy aches this morning."}
{"text":"The food is really bland although the chips and salsa are good. This might explain why a guy at the bar had a beer and chips and salsa and then left. Should have followed his lead. The house margarita I'm pretty sure had water instead of tequila. Oh well -- won't be back again"}
{"text":"Me and a group of coworkers went there for lunch, 16 of us in total. The food was just OK, and the service just about the same.  I'm from Chihuahua, so just seeing yellow cheese takes away from the 'authentic' factor.  I wasn't crazy about the food, but the lack of customer friendliness is what is getting them 2 stars instead of 3.  If you're open for lunch, and there are at least 2 large companies right around the corner, wouldn't you expect working people to come?, and wouldn't you think they will want separate checks and fast service? I mean, to me is common sense, it's a lunch crowd.  They refused, refused to give us separate bills or work with us. We have gone out several places, always a large group, and never had issues paying separate. But not here. HUGE inconvenience for just a so-so food and service.   I rather spend my money elsewhere, and as a group we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite Mexican restaurant around us. The service is top shelf, just like their delicious margs. The food never disappoints. Seriously every time I try something new, it becomes my favorite thing to get. The staff treats you like family, and it is always a pleasant experience every time we go"}
{"text":"Good food.. Friendly staff and nice change of pace and The Chili Colorado is really good."}
{"text":"Was there last night, service was good and friendly. Son had a burrito he liked, wife had shrimp fajitas that she said were ok, i had polo fundito  that was not so good. Very bland, seemed like just chunks of in seasoned chicken stuffed in a tortilla with very little jalapeño cheese sauce on top. Probably won't be back with other Mexican restaurants close by."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time tonight and are thrilled to have this little gem in our neighborhood. Its decorated very festive, service and food were all great.  With not much to offer in the way of restaurants in our neighborhood, we welcome Plaza Bonita with open arms.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more. First time food was ok. Service was slow. Had to ask for more salas but it never came. Ok. Maybe having a off day. Second try today. We had a lunch coupon $5.99 For either two tacos or two enchiladas. With rice and beans. After we both ordered the lunch specials we were told the coupon is only good for ONE person at the table. Ok. so order two item lunch plate $8.99 Taco was soggy and fell apart as soon as I picked it up. Again asked for additional salas and it never came. Both times they were not overwhelmed with lunch customers so you would think the service would be better.   Back to our old standard Manuel's on Bell Ave."}
{"text":"Very good food !! Very good serviceMargaritas are yummy !! Real Mexican food ! !!! I love it!!"}
{"text":"Really good mexican food. The best hot salsa I've had in a while.  F.y.i. you have to ask for it. But well worth it. Had the Carne Asada as well. It was the best I've had in a while too. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just moved here and decided to stop in for happy hour. Super friendly service.Got the house margarita (SOOO good) Also chicken nachos which are amazing! Will definitely be back sometime to try out dinner."}
{"text":"Great food and wait staff was very happy and friendly good value happy hour deals pretty good as well"}
{"text":"Cute place and I had high hopes. However when I got home with my Togo food that dissolve. The chili rellano chez was not melted so not cooked all the way. The burrito that was to be meat chez and rice only had peppers onion and no rice and sauce on top that did not taste good and the chez on top woth was not asked for was burnt dry and rubbery. No rice even on the side. 1 small salsa side was on the bag for 3 people and the side of guack ordered was not on the bag. Sorry won't be back."}
{"text":"Walked in and instantly greeted! Staff was so nice and friendly. Only been a few times but the food is good and it's close to home. Super nachos are great!  Not sure about why other ppl gave 1-2 stars!?!?!  Especially over hamburgers!?!?! It's Mexican food, not McDonald's"}
{"text":"Great food. I had the expresso burrito, my dad had tacos, and my boyfriend had a chicken chimichanga. All of which were fantastic. Great salsa before the meal and a great happy hour everyday 2-6pm. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love this place! We have been here several times before finally deciding to post a review. The service is attentive and friendly. Haven't had anything yet we didn't like and get excited to try something new each visit. Don't forget a patron margaritas or fried ice cream!"}
{"text":"We went to Plaza Bonita for happy hour.  Drafts were only $2.75!!  We stayed for dinner & the food was great.  Everything was very fresh and flavorful.  Try it - you'll like it."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME.  Very Mexican... nice music mix of some classic Spanish mariachi and current top 40.  They greet you when you come in... bilingual. :)  Love it.  When my hubby spoke Spanish to them, they understood, so you know it's authentic. :)  I had the fish tacos. They were absolutely awesome.  Loaded with meat.  The beans and rice were great also.  Hubby had tacos al carbon and he loved them as well.  Hubby, as a full blood Mexican, said that everything had a good down home Mexican taste, not americanized at all.  Service was great, attentive.  They have strong margaritas... awesome.   We will be going back. :)"}
{"text":"My hubby and I stopped here yesterday for a late lunch.  The place was recommended by the Direct TV tech that had done some repairs at our house.   Boy were we ever disappointed!  My husband ordered the pork tacos and had requested flour tortillas but they came out with corn.  After calling our waiter over, we had asked him to change the tortillas to flour as we had originally requested.  He said not problem and within a few minutes, they were back on the table.  That being said, my husband said the pork was dry and lacked flavoring.  I had ordered the cane asada which came out very dry (some of the meat was actually curled up and crisped) and really lacking in flavor.  The beans and rice were just so, so.  Would not recommend although the staff was very friendly and helpful.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"My family and I just recently moved into the area and have been coming here since. The server staff is always kind and gives us as much time as we need and is friendly. I have no bad things about the servers to say. The decorations around the restaurant are very home like with vibrant colors. The taste of the food is great and I recommend the flan for desert! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Possibly the most efficient service that I've ever had in a Mexican restaurant.   Really cute car and brightly painted chairs and tables. Very bright Decore.  Food is right on"}
{"text":"We came across this place just driving around to see what was in the neighboring area. This is the first place in a very long time that I love BOTH the beans and rice. My hubs had the carne asada and it was very flavorful. I had the crab enchiladas with the cream sauce and it was so delicious I almost licked the plate. Real crab, not imitation! The salsa and chips were plentiful. We couldn't believe how quickly the food came out! The service was great and everyone was so nice! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Plaza Bonita is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant that I have ever been to. My wife and I have been coming here since they opened and we have never been disappointed. They all but know our names and the staff treats us like family from the moment they see us approaching the front doors. The ambiance feels authentic, the servers are incredibly friendly and of course the most important, the food is great!  Some of our favorite dishes are the crunchy chicken tacos which are clearly made from fresh tortillas, not store bought factory made garbage. The chimichanga is fantastic if you want a larger portioned meal. My wife either gets the tortilla soup with a side of flower tortillas or the seafood enchiladas. Everything we have ever tasted has never disappointed. Also, if you are into spicy, you must request the salsa verde(green salsa) which is to die for. I have often times asked for some to go for different occasions. Go check it out, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Loved it! So tired of the big chain mexican restaurants, this place was delicious! Beyond friendly service, food was great, good happy hour specials, we'll definitely be returning to try all the items we saw but didn't order. Give it a try! Should enjoy as much as we did..."}
{"text":"One of our favorite local places.  The staff is always friendly and make great margarita's.  Good menu choices other than the standard fare.  DH always lives shrimp and gets good quality for the money.  Haven't found anything on the menu we don't.  Love the whole pinto beans instead of the usually refried option. Try all the margaritas where else can you find this many variations!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Chicken fajita, chicken enchiladas, and tortilla soup are my regular selections. And some fried ice cream if I went running that morning :)  I sometimes call to get it to go on my way home from work, and it's packaged by the time I get there, and always hot when I get home.  Tastes amazing, and is nicely priced. Always clean inside as well!"}
{"text":"Too bad there aren't negative stars - generic no flavor Taco Bell would be closer to authentic.  Poor service pass this one up"}
{"text":"I found this place looking for something quick and they went beyond my expectations.  The servers were great and attentive.  The Garden Fresco Burrito is delicious and humongous!  Great vegetarian option!!   The chips and salsa were good as well."}
{"text":"If there was a -5 stars I would honestly and wholeheartedly give them that. They messed up my dinner as well as my girlfriends dinner on our two year anniversary I said no big deal I just would appreciate it if you made our food again.  I said I understand you know you guys are busy . they were rude refused to remake the food and were just belligerent when speaking to, they would not even listen to me and or speak to me. They just walk the check over dropped it on the table and walked away I seriously would not recommend my worst enemy to eat at this establishment"}
{"text":"So I came to have some dinner with my parents. The chips and salsa were amazing as they had both a mild and hot salsa to serve. The service was excellent as they knew exactly what my mom and my dad wanted before they even ordered. Both of my parents had a wet chicken burrito with green sauce on top. I ordered the Pollo Fundido they came with a side of rice and black beans any mini tortilla bowl. The food was excellent and the service was even better. This is a family ran establishment that I would highly recommend anyone wanting to have Some high-quality Mexican food."}
{"text":"I have a philosophy that if restaurants receive an average of less than 4 stars they are not working hard enough to ensure their guests are completely satisfied. Plaza Bonita which is very close to our home is so great. Consistentcy is the key and we have had nothing less than stellar food and good service every visit we have made. Everything is fresh, eye appealing, flavorful and consistent in our many visits here and the staff works together and hard to please their guests. Everyone is warm, hospitable, and hustles to meet needs, Good job everyone, please maintain these standards and we will be sure to frequent your business and tell others to do the same. The value and quality of your food and service justifies our constant thoughts of you when we wish to eat out."}
{"text":"Finally made it to this restaurant. Loved the albagodonas soup. The margaritas were outrageous. The atmosphere was really authentic. I would definitely go back. My only concern was that the waitress took along time coming back to us. They were busy so I get it. The tacos were also great! The shredded meat was tender and full of flavor! Nice to find a Mexican restaurant with lots of choices. Will eat there again!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered take-out and wasn't real impressed.  I ordered the shredded beef in my taco and enchilada and it was rather dry and not much flavor.  May give them another try but definitely will not order shredded beef for my filling."}
{"text":"My gf and I were greatly disappointed dining here. It was promising from the interesting decor. But the staff was unfriendly and the food was not good.  The pinto beans are pureed and super loose?!?! My gf didn't eat her meal, she did nothing but complain about it. We both ordered the red sauce enchiladas and the sauce definitely is not red.  Our meals were in a long plate and everything blended together and was totally soupy-like throughout the entire dish.  We made a mistake dinning here. The only thing I can recommend is their strawberry margarita. Other than that it is not worth it.   The waitress abruptly came to our table and said \"do you think you can pay me already? I'd like to go home.\" She stated this with an attitude. We didn't know she was waiting on us, etc. She could have said my shift is coming to an end are you ready to pay? If not she could have stated she would have another host/ess close us out.    Do not recommend: Tasteless Pricey for what you get. You don't get much in quantity or quality with the food.  Recommend: Strawberry margarita ONLY.  I don't consider this Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place had some of the best green chili chicken enchiladas. The refried beans and rice were also good. I'm not a big fan of beans anymore, but this place has got it down pact! Also they serve you a bag of tortilla chips with some HOT red salsa. It caught me off guard but the taste is soooo good. My Wife had the chicken chimichanga. I took a bite, and that too was . Last thing...they do happy hour every day. You're Welcome"}
{"text":"Good was very good, excellent fast service and the margaritas are great.  Had the chef salad, healthy option and my husband had the beef fajitas which were very good."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Pleasantly surprised by the margarita, ordered the patron margarita and it was made with fresh lime juice. Delicious! Bartender was very funny and personable. Food was just ok but I was trying to be good and got the garden burrito. It was decent but next time I would try something else. Will go back!"}
{"text":"Just ok nothing to shout about. Food was fair service good and clean. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"The food was very bland. It didn't taste like authentic Mexican food and I tried two different plates. Not good at all. I asked the waiter for two carne asada tacos and he shook his head no.. I thought he was joking, but he said some nonsense about how they only do big orders of carne asada tacos? I didn't fully understand what he was saying, but he just kept shaking his head no.. That I couldn't get tacos. That was a first..a Mexican restaurant not selling carne asada tacos.. Very strange. I ended up getting a chicken enchilada and it was gross. Probably the worst Mexican food I've ever had."}
{"text":"Dinner Tuesday, 5/14/13.  Service efficient, but not warm and friendly.  Maybe because we walked in at 8.30 pm?  The chips and salsa: chips tasted stale and store bought.  Salsa was okay, but seemed to get its heat from a generous helping of hot sauce rather than integration of chile peppers.  DH ordered chicken carnitas and was very happy with his meal.  I ordered Burrito Loco with carne asada.  90% rice with 8% beans and a small amount of tough, unseasoned strips of beef.  I didn't care for the tortilla it was rolled in----tasted flour-y and raw.  Green chile sauce undetectable.  Guacamole was good.  Ice tea was good and served with a generous wedge of lemon----waited refilled several times.  All in all, I found my meal pretty bland bordering on tasteless.  But it was filling and fast and as I said, DH was happy with his.  I probably won't insist on going back, though.  I know there is better Mexican out there."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp a couple months ago and was intrigued by the colorful interior and what looked to be a few vegetarian options. Plaza Bonita was just as good as I was hoping! Fun environment, good food for not terrible prices.  This was one of the only places open on a Sunday in the area so it was a little packed, but not too bad. We got chips and salsa right away and they were good! Salsa had a kick without being too spicy, chips were a little thick, pretty yummy! Some vegetarian burritos caught my eye but I decided on going for veggie fajitas. My boyfriend got some sort of meal with chicken and also got us guacamole. The portions were big! Very filling. We actually were both able to take leftovers home which is rare for us. Not the best guac but not too bad. I loved the variety of veggies they had, yum! Although we both did ask for corn tortillas and we got flour. Wasn't a big deal though. For dessert we decided we had to try the apple chimichanga. It was good but some of the apples inside were frozen and we wished the chimichanga shell was hot. Would've been good if they put cinnamon or something on the apples too. Our server was very friendly and I was happy with that but the only issue was dishes kept piling up on our table and he didn't offer to take any away or get us boxes even though we clearly weren't eating and some of the plates were already empty. Like they gave us our dessert and set it on the only tiny open corner of our table which was covered in dishes. They did finally take them when we asked haha. Otherwise good and we were happy, would love to come back for a yummy burrito! And to try a different dessert."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place in Phoenix for Mexican food. It's a regular stop for my family and I on Wednesday nights. $1.99 Corona Night!!! Food is outstanding, the people are great and the service is always on. Give it a try, you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"This place is great, always busy.  Great chips and salsa.  They have a dish called \"tres mexicano\" or something like that, it has bacon wrapped shrimp, steak and chicken, it is really good. Love the burritos and tacos as well.  Great place, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic Mexican food...the tacos and burritos are out of this world....chips and salsa are delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The food was bland and it wasn't worth the long wait. We were told 15 minutes and waited 45 minutes. They seated three other families that came in after us even though we kept going up and checking and we're being told that we would be next. Rude and frustrating, very poor customer service!"}
{"text":"Our go to for neighborhood Mexican food. Great food even better cocktails always using fresh ingredients. One issue is the guacamole not really  what I would expect from the quality of the rest of the food kind of tastes manufactured"}
{"text":"Looking for a great Mexican restaurant that's not like all the others? The next time you want Mexican food, try Plaza Bonita. I like to frequent local, family-owned businesses whenever possible, and this place is no exception. From the minute you walk in the door, the festive atmosphere instantly uplifts you. The menu is filled with delicious options, but I like the tamales best. And, the margaritas are the best! (Try one with Silver Patron.) They also have a Happy Hour menu that's sure to please. The staff members are friendly and the price is reasonable. But get there early! We've been there all times of day and it's usually busy...another sign of a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"We love this place and frequent it awesome. Staff is very friendly food is always good and arrives quickly."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Frozen banana margaritas are delicious! All servers are really friendly and the food is good! We really enjoyed our visit here and will definitely return."}
{"text":"I had a great, filling meal here. I tried the peach margarita, but I prefer the strawberry or lime. Other than that, service was great, and the place was cute."}
{"text":"We enjoyed great service and good food here tonight.  Our group of three shared Sangria which was the best I have had in memory.  It was tasty, full bodied, and not watered down like others I have tried.  We ordered tamales, enchilada, burrito, and steak tacos and all were delicious.  Our waitress was pleasant, knowledgable, courteous, and attentive.  We will come here again."}
{"text":"I didn't find the food to be that good. It wasn't terrible, just kinda basic. The service was also just basic. I don't think our server smiled once. Price was high for the quality received."}
{"text":"First of all, the tequila selection was off the hook ridiculous! My burrito, however, was not. I ordered a veggie burrito and requested it to be folded up so I could pick it up and eat it. I also subbed out the tomatoes, onions and lettuce for pico de gallo. My burrito came out a mess, open and spilling out all over on one end. I requested to have it re-rolled and the server argued with me, giving me lame excuses like \"the tortillas are too soft\". Finally, he agreed to have the kitchen re-roll my burrito. It came out less than half the size of my dining partner's, whose food was good. As I got over the initial shock at the disparities, enjoyed the rest of my delicious tequila, the bill came. The up charged me $1.50 for pico! I paid $12 for a sad, small, flat burrito. I left feeling less than happy with my experience and it didn't really seem like the server cared at all. Also, the chips were hard, thick, made from yellow corn and tasted like old fryer grease. I will go back, but next time I'm just drinking the tequila!"}
{"text":"Beer is always cold.  Food is always delicious- unless you tend to be picky and ask for things custom (like no veggies or super crispy cheese crisp with 7 layers of cheese and meat dispersed evenly throughout) then it's not always perfect.   Service is good. They are one of the few restaurants in the area (meaning not traveling more than 2 miles) so they are always steady. Especially Thurs-Saturday around dinner- which means fresh(!) and made for you (and totally worth the slight wait time.)   I LOVE their carne asada plate. It's near perfection! I've had almost everything on the menu and you can't go wrong. Burritos are huge. Salsa verde is SPICY (it's not brought out with your chips- ask if you dare, it has been known to cause heartburn) but I can't go with out it.  And when I say spicy- I mean spicy (4-5 Thai spice all day everyday and grew up with traditional homemade salsas and pico de gallo)   Basically- go and get what you love. Their shrimp wrapped in bacon? Delicious. Chicken Mexicana? Fab!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food in the north Phoenix area"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I live right around the corner and we love coming here! The food is always good and hot! The service is awesome and always treat us like friends band they have awesome complementary salsa that they drop off right when you sit down. We love coming here and will never stop. Amazing food!"}
{"text":"So first off, a disclaimer: I still love this place.  A lot.  They do utility (Sonoran-Style) Mexican food like no other in the immediate vicinity.   BUT (\"There's always a big butt.\" - PeeWee Herman) the fish tacos taste EXACTLY like a Big Mac.  It's the combo of mayo/pickle relish and shredded lettuce.  I'll never be able to disassociate.  The fish was kind of weird too, now that I think about it.  Sad, overcooked nuggets of farm-raised failure.    Salsa? Still runny, but better flavor than I remember.  Service? Great.  Prices? Wonderful. Margaritas? Cheap, at least during happy hour.  Beef/Chicken Tacos?  Stellar.   Okay, so just don't order the fish tacos.  ;)"}
{"text":"Have to say that this little restaurant is one of my favorite in this area. The staff is friendly always making sure your drinks are topped off as well as the chips! This time I did take out and they were very quick to get the order placed it took about 5-7 mins from the time I got in to walk out with my food. Since it is a small place it does fill up rather quickly however they do a amazing job of getting the food out rather quickly which in turn opens up a table which generally mean if there is a wait it's not more than 15 mins! This place is great for just meeting up with friends or taking the family out for dinner. They have a great selection of dishes as well as a pretty decent bar. Only bad thing I would say is since they are quick in getting the food out sometimes it does feel as if they are rushing you out. The restaurant is kept very clean and all in all I would recommend this as a great place to give a try!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place. First time at this restaurant. I am picky when it comes to Mexican food and good chips and salsa are a must. Loved the food, service and atmosphere. Recommend asking for the chunky salsa, which has a bit of kick with the right amount of veggies. Great homemade chips! Meals were amazing, especially the arroz con pollo. Gracie and the staff were also very attentive and friendly! Can't go wrong here if you are looking for authentic food, and super service."}
{"text":"Went there last night for my Mother's birthday, it's done a lot better since the first time the opened that's for sure! I love the music they have playing; Selena... and Shakira! Their chips and salsa are sooo good. I ordered the Polla Fundido their crime sauce on the rope is not what your used to it's runny and not thick. It was still good though, although the first dish I got was cold the second one was great! Their kids menu was good for my 2Y/O, and for only $ 3.25 is a good deal. If it's your birthday I guess they give you a free shot of tequila and not the good stuff lol but our server was attentative, although he was a little overwhelmed with having to many tables, so he would disappear for a bit due to him being busy. Fried Icecream was good. It for sure has improved, the food is good but still needs to work on some stuff ;)"}
{"text":"Another great meal! I drive from Buckeye just for this. Had a macho burrito pollo = excellent"}
{"text":"Meh. Plaza Bonita is close by and we really liked our server, but our meals were just OK and my house margarita was not good. The salt was terrible-- that weird cheap stuff. I had fajitas, which are supposed to be the house specialty, but they were nothing special. Just OK. I think the only reason we'd come back would be proximity and the fact that they have dino nuggets for kids (which in our family, is a live saver). Still, I can't imagine it happening."}
{"text":"Food is very good-great selection of tequila.  Medium sauce has a kick so I mix it with mild.  Place is clean and always busy."}
{"text":"Really, one of the worst Mexican Food Restaurants in the area, and while the decor is nice and this would be a good place to take the kids, the food is just terrible and the place is expensive.  Tough to find good Mexican food in Phoenix, but this just isn't it."}
{"text":"Burrito Colorado is excellent, camarones quesadilla is amazing, & sopapillas are to die for! Gracie is the best at the bar, as well as the rest of her family! Everyone is super friendly and welcoming. Service is quick & accurate. I have never had a complaint since I've been coming here (about a year). We drive from Anthem & have never left disappointed. These owners are hard working & amazing people. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just ate here for the first time. It is really cute and colorful. Service was friendly and the drinks and food came promptly. I had the house margarita and it was quite good. I ordered nachos and specifically asked for shredded beef and jalapeños. There was not much beef but they were fairly tasty. Not the best I've had but I would not say they were bad either. My husband said his shredded beef taco was very good.  Overall I was happy and would return."}
{"text":"We meet friends here maybe once every two weeks for some margaritas and food.  I read some of the other reviews, and will comment: I love the fish tacos.  We've never had a rude server.  The salsa is great, just hot enough.  Maybe we're an easy to please crowd, but we're always happy when we leave."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Went there for the first time for dinner last week.  Once we ordered we started to notice that the place got kinda busy.  I remember thinking that this place must be pretty good. Sure enough it was!  I ordered the Flauntas combo and my mom ordered chicken fajitas.  I tried her fajitas too of course.  Everything tasted fresh and flavor was amazing.  They brought us free chips and salsa too while we waited."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Even when they are slammed busy the staff is friendly. We drive by 2 other Mexican restaurants to come here."}
{"text":"I have only been there once so far but my Pollo fundido burrito was fantastic! The food was very fresh and the service was quick I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd time here and our last. The first trip several months ago was actually ok. The trip today made us rethink our first decision. The chips we're ok but the salsa tasted like a spicy pizza sauce. I ordered the standard beef taco salad. The beef was so greasy I couldn't stomach more than 3 bites. The shell was so rubbery and chewy like it was left over from last night and zapped in the microwave prior to serving. Not once did our waiter ask how things were. He basically collected our plates and laid down the check. We are moving to the area and won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food with good family-friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"The green corn tamale was hard, cheese enchilada was OK. Rice was good and beans standard. What gave it 2 stars is the service. A kid at Taco Bell is friendlier. I sat at the bar and I think the bartender talked to me once, and it was to see if I wanted anything else. UM... NO! Service makes everything. It can make so so food better... This service made the bad food stand out more. I will be going to El Encanto Dos instead. It is out of the way but it is better service and much better food."}
{"text":"Plaza Bonita is a small chain of Mexican restaurants that are scattered throughout Arizona. This Carefree Highway location is the only one found within Phoenix boundaries.   This particular area is one that I've always been a bit reluctant about when it comes to trusting positive reviews. With all due respect, there's isn't really much to compare the food against. There are no other Mexican restaurants in this neighborhood, so they've pretty much got the entire area locked down.  Honestly, don't drive out of your way to visit this place and expect anything beyond your standard, slightly generic-feeling dining experience with Mexican food. The style is on par with what you'd find at Macayo's or Popo's, although the food is a bit lower on the scale - which isn't saying much, as neither of those places are that great.  Enchiladas were just dull, with the rice and beans being just your typical \"tack-on\" items that do little to enhance the dishes. Chips and salsa were okay, but we decided to pass on dessert, as I doubt this place would offer any real surprises.  I mean, if you really like Mexican food and you take issue with driving more than five miles to obtain it, I'm sure it'll hit the spot. But with the vast array of options we have available if you're willing to venture deeper into Phoenix, this definitely wouldn't be one of my first choices.  Not my style. Sorry!"}
{"text":"A gem of a spot. Cold, cold beer ! Variety of dishes, tasty and good portions. I am at Lake Pleasant multiple weekends per month, always eat here on Fridays when arriving in the area, or Sunday when heading back home. Some of the best beef fajitas around !"}
{"text":"Just stopped in on a trip to Wickenberg. I had the Pollo Azado Burrito, under the healthy choices section. Hands down best burrito I have ever had. The chicken was sliced really thin, combined with black beans and marinated mushrooms and carrots and rolled into a flour tortilla and topped with a delicious pico de gallo.  My friend had a salad with marinated shredded chicken that she raved about too. Fun decor and amazing food! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great environment and food with prices that won't hurt your wallet.  This restaurant has become a once a week for me mostly due to their hot sauce and happy hour."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a late Sunday afternoon dinner with my wife and daughter. When we first got there, the place was empty, but within 30 minutes 85% of the tables were full. The service was awesome. Our waters, margaritas, chips, and salsa never sat empty. The young server was very nice, and checked on us several times. We let her know it was our first visit, And she gave some good recommendations. We are looking forward to returning soon.."}
{"text":"I went here today based off a recommendation from a friend who visited their Cottonwood location. He said the food was good and had a nice spicy kick. So I ordered from this one since it's by my house and they told me my order would be ready in 10 minutes. I showed up in 8 minutes and my order was already done and sitting on a counter by the front door getting cold( and was indeed cold when I got home after the 8 minute drive back). Made fresh? Hahaha. I ordered a beef shredded taco and pollo azado burrito. The beef taco might have been all right, but unfortunately the lettuce cheese and tomatoes were all completely removed from the shell when I got home and it was cold. Seemed like the flavor was decent though. Onto the burrito... Probably the worst burrito I've ever had. It was cold, falls apart as soon as you cut into it, and is sweet. And I'm not talking a hint of sweetness. I mean overly, sickly sugary-sweet with no heat whatsoever. I've never tasted anything close to this (even in sweeter dishes like mole) in any Mexican food in my life.I even had two other people try the burrito that are at my house and one of them spit it out and the other said they would never order one of those if their life depended on it. Chips were stale and the salsa was more garlic than Mexican flavor but wasn't even expecting them so no big deal I guess. Considering one taco and one burrito was $15,  I would expect it to taste good, warm and fresh. None of which happened.  Very disappointing considering I finally thought I knew where there might be a good Mexican food place in the North Valley. Being 100% honest and truthful, I would prefer Filibertos any day of the week and that says a lot..."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch, had been a couple of years ago for their fish tacos.  The fish tacos were good but everything that went with it was just ok at best.  Rice and beans were less than average and we didn't like the guacamole at all.  I would go back for the fish tacos but wish they had them a la carte because the food that accompanies was not good."}
{"text":"Save yourself the trip and go to taco bell across the street.  Had the arroz con pollo but it tasted like ketchup con pollo.  Carnitas was dry.  Salsa was bland."}
{"text":"My first time here, and I have to say I think this is one of the better Mexican joints in the Anthem/Carefree area.  I had the Deluxe burrito with picadillo beef.  I thought the beef was very tasty and the burrito was a good size as well.  I also shared an order of nachos with my brother and they were delicious!  I think the nachos could have used more guacamole but that's about it.  There were 6 of us at dinner and everyone enjoyed their meals.  It's a bit small inside too, but was busy, so you might have to wait but overall I was pleased. I'll be going back."}
{"text":"When I first arrived in Arizona, this was the first restaurant that I went to. I was very impressed and went back many times over the following 3-4 months. Unfortunately, a few months ago, something changed about the food. I don't know why things changed, but the quality went downhill. My favorite enchiladas suizas were tasting a little bland... or every once in a while, too spicy to consume. This just got inconsistent. I tried going back a few more times over the past three months to see if it was just a rough patch, but I haven't seen any improvement."}
{"text":"Good selection at very reasonable prices.  The margarita's are excellent.  This restaurant is a big step up from Taco Bell with large selection of menu items.  Friendly and courteous staff, speedy service, hot plates, friendly atmosphere.  We go there frequently with friends."}
{"text":"Great Mexican place.... We were looking for somewhere in the Cave Creek area as we weren't too excited about the food at El Encanto Dos which was just so-so. We YELPED this one and were really happy when we went about a month ago for dinner. Huge plates of yummy food, great margaritas and very friendly and prompt service. Great chips and salsa they give you to eat while you wait.  So we went back last week just for a margarita after shopping and sat at the bar. The bartender is just as excellent as the wait staff and gave us chips to eat while we had our drinks. we then ordered nachos as we couldn't resist and they were very good... Not a massive plate like you get in a sports bar but a great 10 inch size plate loaded with cheese, beans, guacamole and sour cream. Perfect snack with your drinks, and since it was happy hour it was only $4.50 and not $6.50 which would have been a great deal anyway.  We live in the area and will definitely make this our local fave spot for Mexican.... No need to drive so far anymore!"}
{"text":"Some of the best in our area.  We are regulars and come here all the time. Staff is friendly and carne asada is perfect."}
{"text":"My family and I were very disappointed with this restaurant. The food was not appetising and tasted bland. The dishes we chose were very standard but didn't taste as good as Taco Bell. Plus, we all had stomach aches afterward for the rest of the night. The wait staff was disinterested in us. We never got more chips or water. They never took our plates away after the meal. We had to wait to get our bill. We won't be back, mexican food is not that hard to make tasty, I just don't understand how they missed the mark so badly."}
{"text":"In love with this place!!! The food was absolutely delicious and the service was phenomenal. Love the complementary chips and salsa, the salsa was BOMB I've never had such tasty salsa in my life! The portion of the food was huge and prices were great. Love the decor of the place, very colourful and cute! Definitely recommend it and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad at all!  I went with a co-worker for lunch. I Love the colors inside the place. Vey bright!! I got the taco/enchilada lunch plate. It was very tasty, and honestly pretty on-par with what you would expect from a Mexican joint for lunch. The one thing that I DO like very much is the roasted corn that they put in their rice. YUMMMM!  That's is a big time win in my opinion.  I have been to one other Plaza Bonita; in Cottonwood. I ordered the Pollo Mole.   AMAZING!  I wish there was a better way to present it, as it looked like Chinese style stir-fry chicken, on a plate of chocolate soup. LOL BUT, after I ate all the chicken, I asked for extra tortillas( which were kindly retrieved), and I sopped up the remaining mole sauce( which is sweet, with a hint of peanut butter) I have yet to find a Mexican place here in AZ that matches a place back east called EL TORO.  Im hoping to find one. Plaza Bonita is it so far."}
{"text":"Just walked out of this establishment. Went because of good reviews on yelp. Did not even stay to finish our Happy Hour drinks that had no alcohol in them. Chips were stale and salsa uneatable.  We travel with a Service dog and was told they are not welcome here. That is against the law people! Going down the road to a really great Mexican Restaurant..."}
{"text":"Really??? What did I miss that the other more positive Yelpers saw?   First the positives; fast, efficient and friendly service, good chips, great guacamole and excellent salsa. The end.   Bad? First the margaritas; on the suggestion of our server I had the pomegranate Margarita. Might have given me diabetes it was so sweet. Moved on to the top of the list margarita that tasted like it was blended with cough syrup. So bad.   The tacos al pastor were dry and boring, but ok, good refrieds. My husband ordered the chicken mole. Again, diabetes central. Who knew they could make mole using karo syrup as the main ingredient.   Mexican food can be all over the place, but this place was sadly not even close to being worth the calories. Giant thumbs down."}
{"text":"Super excited for a New Mexican restaurant nearby. Great happy hour and service with great food. Great portion. I will definitely be returning here again."}
{"text":"Standard, run of the mill Mexican food. If you like boring Mexican food (like El Encanto Dos), this is your place.  Pros: Super fast service. It's like they have what you ordered already on a plate in the back.  Cons: Most likely you will wait for a table, which BTW, have more flavor than their food."}
{"text":"Great food! We ordered take out and it was ready in less than 20 mins! Food was hot and fresh. Staff was very attentive while taking the order and during pick up."}
{"text":"Tiny little place, and they don't take reservations. The food is average and the prices are a bit high for what it is."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is excellent. The service, seems as if waiters are very pushy and always trying to up sell you on every plate. The food is not the best to be honest, however they do give big portions to make up for the average meal. The Pollo Fundito was a complete letdown as I am accustomed to a jalapeño cream cheese topping. This was a cream sauce as stated but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. My wife's enchilada was not cooked all the way through but her taco was good. The fish tacos were very skimpy on the portion of fish. Literally 1 piece of Talapia and cut up to put in 3 tacos. Salsa was good, chips were to thick and hard. Overall, an average place to eat, you will get filled up but every mexican restaurant is like that. Atmosphere and bar, excellent."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food priced right. I've had many items off their menu and have yet to be disappointed.  Service is always prompt and excellent.  I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I don't really know what to consider this place, not quite a sit down but not really fast food either. I should say I have never actually dined in we have always ordered take out but I've never seen any table service the handful of times I've been in. The food here is good, simple and fresh. However one major suggestion if your ordering take out, always check your boxes before you leave. I learned the hard way after having my order messed up 3 out of 4 times. Other than that it's good food with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Just moved from Missouri and we've been looking for a place in the North Valley that was comprable to our favorite Mexican Cuisine back home. We finally found it in Plaza Bonita. Great service, great food and a great selection of margaritas. The only thing they could do differently is make the Margaritas available in a pitcher. :)"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice since I moved here and it is outstanding.  Great atmosphere inside, very friendly staff and a well stocked bar.  Both my wife and I found the food to be outstanding with great rice and beans on the side.  Prices are very reasonable and this is a place I would go back to for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I are here on almost a weekly basis. I usually get the Combo#1 with a tostada. The food is good and the staff is friendly. I really enjoy going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The restaurant is cozy, clean and colorfully decorated. The margaritas were good and the food is typical Americanized Mexican. Great for families and kids as the bar area is tiny."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed Plaza Bonita the few times I've been there.  It hasn't knocked my socks off, but it is pretty good Sonoran Mexican food.  The atmosphere is nice.  The service is good, and the restaurant is clean.  They would score more points with me if they made their own chips and/or tortillas, but all in all a good place to eat."}
{"text":"We were just here for a ladies night out for dinner and drinks. Two of the five drinks were sent back as there was not much alcohol in them, the food came and one of the plates had chicken on it, mind you it was not a chicken dish. Another was a taco salad with no lettuce, a plate of lettuce was brought out instead of the dish taken to the back to be fixed and then a beef dish was brought out instead of a chicken dish! When the waiter was asked what it was on the first plate, he replied, \"it's chicken, it fell off another plate\". We all were shocked at that response. I had a chicken quesadilla, it was not very tasty and I have had plenty of them. Finally, I paid my bill in cash and was not brought back any change! It was just overall not a very good experience. At least my drink was good!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food! Really good chips & salsa, nice environment and great service. Love the bean and cheese burrito enchilada style. Prices are super reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Regulars since it has opened and our family's go to spot. Always great service and food is always good. Most of the staff remembers our orders without having to tell them, which shows they care about their customers."}
{"text":"I just ate here for the first rime this past Friday and was pleasantly surprised.  I got the fajitas which were awesome. Everyone else loved their food as well. When we walked up we were a little taken back by the decor as it looked a little childish.  Once we got our food we quickly realized this is our new and only favorite Mexican place."}
{"text":"Great fajitas!  I recommend the shrimp and beef fajitas.  It is not on the menu but they'll make it if you ask.  The shrimp end up with a great GBD crust and the beef is well seasoned and tender. Service is prompt and friendly.  Good for families/kids.  A very good value."}
{"text":"Fajitas were good. Rellno was soggy. Tacos AlCarbon had too much tortillas. Flan was unacceptable. Good service and good margaritas."}
{"text":"Yummy and good service . Will be back and will be bringing some friends. Good experience"}
{"text":"The last 2 times we've been here the food wasn't as good as when it first opened. We stopped in for dinner last weekend after not having been here since our last subpar experience 6 months ago, but the food was the same. It just doesn't taste as good as it used to, but I can't put my finger on exactly what the difference is. The salsa verde isn't nearly as good, though it used to be my favorite salsa. My husband ordered the chicken fajitas and was not satisfied. He asked me, \"How do you screw up fajitas?\" My daughter ordered a burrito with red enchilada sauce on it and she complained that the sauce was sweet and ruined her burrito. Next time I have a hankering for Mexican food I will keep driving."}
{"text":"Stopped here because we wanted full service Mexican unfortunately, we were left disappointed. The service was friendly but very slow and they food was not impressive.   The salsa reminded us of spicy spaghetti sauce. My husband had the Colorado burrito which he said was okay. My son's fajitas order came out wrong, it took several minutes to get the tortillas and he said it was just okay. I ordered the chicken chimichangas which came out with no sauce. The chicken inside was good but my side of rice was very dry.   On an up note I ordered vodka margaritas and they were excellent!!  I would probably only return for a margarita in the future."}
{"text":"Love this place! Staff is welcoming and the food is great. The salsa they serve is excellent and the chips are fresh. Great value and great food."}
{"text":"I go here on a regular basis and I really enjoy the food and service. The workers all recognize me now and are super friendly. A wide assortment of Mexican dishes that are all worth trying until you find your favorite dish. My only word of warning is that weekends are extremely hard to get in at night. It's not a very big place so you will be waiting to get in. If you have the time it'll be worth the wait."}
{"text":"Sorry for not posting before pictures ! But I think my son agrees ! Amazing food ! I have seen this place 100 times I get my hair cut next door and finally made it in. So happy I stopped in. My server was Lucero , very nice and on top of service thank you !"}
{"text":"Very colorful place. Excellent service and the food is delicious. All the dishes are well made and very tasty. The prices are also very reasonable. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"It's improved to at least a three overall and a four for Happy Hour (HH), I'm happy to report! The HH is not just in the bar area; it's restaurant-wide, so that's cool and it's available daily from 2-6pm: it's $2.00 off all appetizers and discounted margaritas. (Not sure if cerveza is on the HH, but go on in and find out!)  The service is fun and friendly, professional too. I appreciate the fast delivery of complimentary chips and salsa to the table. Never had to wait on these! I also appreciate the very festive and colorful \"Mexican\" decor. It does feel like \"fiesta!\"   Our usual HH order is now the prawns appetizer and/or the quesadilla, and of course, a couple of margaritas. The margs don't pack a huge wallop but they are not too sweet, which is good to my buds. (No \"wings\" on the menu due to the nearby restaurant who apparently won't allow another business in the strip mall to offer wings. Non-compete on wings, really!??)   Overall, we've given them another chance and have found certain elements of \"Plaza Bonita\" to our liking.  (note: 2014 pics/prices up slightly since then) shrimp quesadilla https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/plaza-bonita-phoenix?select=JMbwCHAOS7yKMtrF4aOnVg  large and small margs https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/plaza-bonita-phoenix?select=uUuM0QSi6RNPDMme8LiWDQ  2014 prawns: https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/plaza-bonita-phoenix?select=0KuFWS_If2gZd7WnanaFtA It was mostly prawns back then, now, they have fewer prawns and have added more sauce, mushrooms and rice:"}
{"text":"Hubby and I tried this place on Friday.  We really enjoyed ourselves.  Good service, good food and reasonably priced.  Can't complain we will be back!"}
{"text":"Very good! We had bacon wrapped shrimp and Albondigas soup and of course margaritas .  Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Great little Mexican restaurant, better food and prices than the big chains.  I only wish they had some spicy items on the menu, everything is pretty mild."}
{"text":"Great place, love the food, beautiful atmosphere. The decor is very colorful and bright. Food is always great, have never had a bad dish."}
{"text":"We liked the Plaza Bonita in Cottonwood, and were happy to find this one so much closer to home. The place was busy on a Sunday evening but there was no wait for a table. Love the bright colors and festive feel. The chips are a little thicker than I like and could use some salt, but our actual meals were great. Pollo Fundido was very good and did have the cream sauce (but not a lot so ask for extra if you love the sauce). I do wish they would shred the chicken instead of dicing it, but flavor was really great. Black beans were also good. Got a side enchilada with ground beef which was pretty standard but also good. Wife got the super nachos as a meal and they were awesome. Service was fast and friendly. We will certainly be back as this is the best Mexican food we've found so far in NoPho. Better than El Encanto and anything in Anthem. Second only to Manuels on Bell in NW Phoenix, but this is a lot closer to us."}
{"text":"We enjoyed two different shrimp dishes.  One was with mushrooms and one was bacon and ham wrapped shrimp.  They were both really good.  The salsa wasn't as good as some that I've had.  It was really spicy and kind of thin.  Service was good.  Prices were ok."}
{"text":"I've been to Plaza Bonita a couple of times and really enjoyed what I ordered. The margaritas are good, fresh chips and salsa. The food is definitely homemade Mexican. I will be a regular for sure."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was excellent. We stopped here during a road trip and didn't have much time to spend. The waiters were attentive and quick and bringing our order. The restaurant was clean, and the atmosphere was casual and enjoyable. We would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my family. I was parking the car as my family walked in. Greeter ask my wife if there three of us as I walked in and my wife replied no there's four. Greeter then replied oh in a not so friendly way. We ordered drinks and received then when my special needs son had an unexpected meltdown. My wife proceeded to take my son out of the restaurant in hopes to calm him down. Server then asked if we'd like chips and salsa. I replied not right now not knowing if we'd be eating there or not just yet. At this point the check came for drinks like my choice had been made. At this point I was feeling my business was unwanted so I paid check and left. As of now I'm not planning on ever returning to Plaza Bonita."}
{"text":"This place opened on 8/2/11. Ketzal Mexican used to be here, but Plaza Bonita took over after Ketzal failed. This place is slightly better than Ketzal. The staff is very friendly, but the food was average to below average. Chips were boring. Salsa boring. Beans, cheese, and beef dip was weird but ok. The Macho Burrito wasn't very \"macho\" and wasn't very good either. My wife thought it was ok, but I thought it was below average. I'd give it a 1 out of 5. She'd give it a 3 out of 5. Either way, not great and this place won't get very good reviews in the future."}
{"text":"We just randomly stopped by looking for margaritas and chips. I freaking love it here! I've never really been to Mexico (just TJ but does that even count?) but I feel like I am there! Haha even have Mexican news on the TV. We're at the bar but service is great, house margs are great, Super Nachos were so good and the salsa is delicious! Perfectly spicy. We will definitely come back for a full meal sometime."}
{"text":"Really good food (and tons of it). I definitely recommend the chimichangas and all the desserts.. They always seem to be empty, but I assume it's because they're new-ish and kind of far from the regular food places"}
