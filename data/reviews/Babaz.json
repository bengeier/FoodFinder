{"text":"I found the interior design a little different than most fast food places, this I liked. The food was OK and reasonably priced, this I liked as well. 
I actually liked it enough to recommend that my client's purchase a franchise but after giving a $16,500.00 refundable deposit they changed their mind. It's been three months and the president George Kottas hasn't returned their money, this I didn't like! 
They may be in financial trouble so they may be looking for ways to cut corners in labour and food."}

Babaz appears to be a small shawarma chain with a few locations outside of the GTA and now making its way into the GTA. Their first Toronto location is this Church & Richmond corner sit down/take out venue.

The restaurant is clean, new, bright, sunny, lots of nice comfy tables. It's smack dab on a corner and great for people watching or those who enjoy natural sun light. 

Alas there were lots of things I didn't like. The menu board is confusing. They have a number of a la cart shawarma in a pita offerings based on topping and a range of meats. And the menu makes it appear like there's a \"dinner\" option that comes with rice/fries/salad on the side (pick two). Unfortunately the dinner option is a stand alone item which comes with the sides and your choice of meat on rice.

I tried to order the greek shawarma as a dinner option. My order went unchallenged but the counter woman just whipped up the meat on rice dinner option. Hmmm. It took me a bit to explain my confusion and what I was trying to order. The manager resolved the issue in my favor so props there. 

The food?

Well, an a la carta shawarma in pita runs about $7. No side. No drinks. You get a small pita with a small portion of meat and a few veggies. This is no $5 foot long from Subway. I ordered the lamb and found the lamb fatty and without seasoning.

Maybe this place is new and going through some teething pains but I was not impressed with the prices, the actual food, the portions, or the staff's ability to recognize a new customer trying to order something not on the menu (and then simply going ahead and trying to cook up what they think the customer wants).

The web site seems to indicate several GTA  locations are in the process of opening but if they're going to make any name for themselves in a highly competitive city like Toronto, they're going to have to improve their portions and taste."}
