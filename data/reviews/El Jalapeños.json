{"text":"Food is always consistent and very good, I always get fajitas or the pollo loco because well, if it's not broke don't fix it! Margaritas are good and the food came out quick. Decently priced my only complaint is that I almost always have to wipe off the booth seat before I sit down or I'll be wearing someone else's meal."}
{"text":"This place is no doubt my favorite in town whenever I need cheep and delicious Mexican food. I usually start off with their bean dip which is simple yet fantastic. Then I get the chimichangas which are to die for and they come with a generous serving of rice and beans to leave me full every time. Service is extremely fast every time"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, food was great authentic mexican and the price was great.  Nice place for kids.  My waiter was a little slow, but the price and the delicious taste of the food made up for it.  Parking is a little tight but if you can get in its a great place to go."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service...and the food is actually good!!!!  I couldn't believe how fast the food came out!  Literally five minutes after we ordered the food was there!  The fajitas were fantastic...the guacamole was good, although a little chunky for my taste.  Overall a good experience and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just ate here again last weekend for the first time in months.  I can't believe I went so long without paying a visit.  I've never had a bad meal at this restaurant.  The chips and salsa are addicting...So much so, in fact, that I've actually ordered a Styrofoam to-go cup of the salsa before.  If this kind of clearly ravenous lust for tomato-y, onion-y, cilantro-y goodness isn't your style, at least get all you can while you're at the restaurant -- refills on chips and salsa are free.  Prices overall are reasonable.  This is the only Mexican restaurant I've eaten at where I've actually finished my whole entree before, and enjoyed every bit of it.

My favorite dishes are the chimichangas and the flautas (if I'm remembering correctly, the meat is shredded in these, and I like the texture, flavor, and tenderness of the shredded chicken or beef vs. the diced), but really anything is good -- even the spinach burritos!  The lunch portions are still large, but not ridiculously large.  Look for the daily lunch and dinner specials on the small chalkboard hanging on the wall in front of you just after entering from outside, to the left of the door to the dining room.  

I don't think we've ever had to wait for a table.

El Jalapeno's also boasts some of the largest margaritas around, but I hear they're a little light on the alcohol.  Might be worth trying, though, if only for the \"I did it\" factor.

Truthfully, it's one of my favorite places in Lakewood.  Mmmm, Mexican!"}
{"text":"The food here is the best Mexican I've ever had. It always comes out quick. 

When it's not busy, all the workers congregate either around the bar or by the kitchen doors. Right now, I see five employees on their cell phones. Don't you have something to clean?

Speaking of cleaning, my booth was sitting next to an air intake with inches of caked on dust."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times.  The food is decent/fatty/cheesy mexican food that you would expect.  The prices are GREAT for the portion you get.  

But I must say, I would give this place a 5/5 stars for service.  I recently went there with a group of 12, during lunch, with no reservation, and the staff was super accommodating and friendly!!!!

Oh, and for the other comments that El Jalapeno, Los Habaneros, Si Senor, etc are all carbon copies of each other...well...I'm 99% sure it's the same parent company.  The menus at Los Habaneros say \"here at Si Senor\"...so...that typo probably says enough...."}
{"text":"I have eaten there before and it was alright. But odd I like when the server returns to ask everything alright? There seemed to be only one girl on the dinning room for \"taco Tuesday\". My tacos were cold. And I couldnt get her attention and I just had a long shift at the hospital. Begrudedly ate them and left. I will be looking for better Mexican spots and will take suggestions lol"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Cooked from scratch and served up by a friendly staff. Atmosphere is great and the prices are right on. Margaritas are impressive.  Best Mexican/American in Akron."}
{"text":"Great service. Good prices and portion sizes. The tamales and chicken tortilla soup are my favorite menu items."}
{"text":"Great wings! Love Taco Tuesday!  And free chips with salsa. Plus they have the belly card to earn rewards. I am enjoying a $1 cervesa!"}
{"text":"The (very) old Kluck's location has changed over to this new Mexican place. It's much more bright and cheery. The food is decent, plentiful and cheap. The margaritas are large and potent, and the service was very good. (Maybe it helps to be blonde.) It's not the best or most authentic Mexican restaurant in town, but it's nice to have in this underserved area."}
{"text":"We started out joking that they should have just called it \"EL KLUCK'S\" or \"Los Klucko's\". This joint was Kluck's for over forty years. Forty years of frozen, overcooked, marginal seafood. Why go there? We didn't. So when \"El Klucko's\" opened we went with another couple and figured \"well, how bad could it be?\"  One thing is: it's CHEAP. So they will draw the alternative types from the area. They slapped on the usual red, white and green paint and opened the doors within a week of Kluck's closing. At least you get to sit down and get served for your $10.00. Salsa: standard. No salsa verde. I asked the waitress (in Spanish) for salsa verde and she brought another salsa roja. Oh, well. The chips were warmed but not, as far as we could tell, made on the premises. I asked the waiter if I could get a chile relleno without the beans and rice. He said \"well, it's only another two dollars for the beans and rice\". He was kind of arguing with me! So I caved in. What came was the usual plate of slop. Chile relleno BURIED in bland rice, bland beans, and tons of tasteless cheese. I really can't stand that kind of Mexican food. It isn't even Mexican. It's Am-Mex. More cheese, more better? Isn't that the American way? Bland, stringy, tasteless, a mass of melted post-atomic-bomb hole-filler. 
I really don't need that particular hole filled up in that way. Margarita report: among four people we had three pitchers of sour-mix Margaritas. We didn't even feel as though we had anything to drink. Stick with beer, I guess. At least you know what's in there. Service was perfunctory. Food was not so good. Drinks were weak. Crowd all looked a little rough around the edges and perhaps unbathed. Music was obtrusive.  UPDATE: Well, we DID go again.  Guacamole was okay this time. Enchiladas and tamales were edible. Rice: still bland. The ranchero style beans: all right. I would still steer clear of the margaritas. NO LIQUOR in there at all. Last time we took a flask of tequila and added our own (is that legal?), but beer is the best bet. The margarita is pure Lemix. They do not have wine by the bottle. Chorizo and eggs are edible. They don't seem to mind how long you stay, which is a plus. People watching is GREAT. Some serious characters with insane hairdos. Very John Waters. We keep waiting for Divine to waddle in with some kind of sequined poncho on. The fake Mexican accents on some of the waiters can get rather old. \"Hola Amigos!\" from a guy with hipster glasses and a fauxhawk? Still, it IS pretty cheap. And the portions are humongous. ANOTHER UPDATE: well, we went AGAIN. We won't be going any more. There was a bone in my husband's bean burrito. This would have been a real buzz kill for a vegetarian. I also ordered the ranchero beans again and this time it was almost all water, floppy cheap bacon,  and a few beans. Eggs with chorizo were hard as  rocks, but with chorizo. Salsa tastes different every time. Guacamole is definitely from Sam's Club. Don't torture yourself with this place. I have been to Mexico many times, and lived in California with great Mexican food all over the place. This ain't authentico. It is very uneven. I really want to like it, because it's so close to home, but after that bone in the bean burrito, it is finito."}
{"text":"GREAT service and food. Every time we go to this place the servers are friendly and attentive. The food comes out quickly but is delicious. Highly recommend the combination plates with a chile releno."}
{"text":"terribad.  tastes like sloppy joes with different sized tortillas. i enjoy ameri-mex but this is simply not enjoyable."}
{"text":"Kinda saddened by this place . I've been going here for about 4 years now regularly , but I now only go here out out if desperation for a quick Mexican fix . The food suffered a little when they switched cooks , but not horrible so I tolerated it . Unfortunately now the service is horrible also . My friend and I sat there for 10mins eating tortilla chips and drinking water before they took our order . There were only 3 or 4 tables of guest so they weren't busy . I'm a regular there so they recognized me . My waiter wondered around the restaurant and even stopped to watch soccer . I had to flag him down twice before I got his attention . If my friend wasn't pressed for time because he had to go back to work we would have left . Working in the service industry I rarely complain and I always tip above 15% , but for the first time I would not tip . I hope they get it together until then I'll be at one of the other many Mexican and Puerto Rican restaurants in Cleveland ."}
{"text":"My girls and I pick this as our go to spot for inexpensive mexican. It is good and they come out with your food quick. 
I have never had a bad meal here better than cozmel."}
{"text":"Food is always super HOT and tastes great. Try the charro beans, any shrimp dish, or anything else on the menu. I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"The one place I miss now that I no longer live in Lakewood. The food tastes great at good prices. Nice selection of meals and drinks... daily specials too. The margarita's are strong, but taste great. Anyone giving this place below 4 stars is confused and thinks Taco Bell is authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and the drinks were also. They even brought orange slices for the baby. Service quick!"}
{"text":"Quick service and good food. 

We did come in the door at the front of the building...which is apparently wrong. But there was no sign and it wasn't locked haha!"}
{"text":"Whenever a friend suggests Mexican food in our area, El Jalapenos is never brought up as a possible option. 

I've eaten there numerous times, maybe i was ordering the wrong thing. It seems like most of the items on the menu are the wrong thing. The food quality is like Chi-Chi's or something."}
{"text":"They burn my flautas first time! They replace them, flavor good and good portion. No sure I wanted to go back for a Mexican place no that good."}
{"text":"I visit here often. They have good Mexican food. I usually go for the spinach el pollo, very tasty. On my last visit I ordered a new  dish on the menu. Seafood nachos and it was delicious. It had nice chunks of shrimp and crab over chips, lettuce, tomatoes and cheese. The margarita's are good too. I enjoy coming here"}
{"text":"The authentic Mexican food brought us here, the plethora of margarita flavors and personal favorites such as chili rellenos combined with good service and very reasonable prices is what brings us back. Make sure to save room for the fried ice cream! You will be amazed."}
{"text":"My friend and I met there at 7:30 on a Wednesday night.  They have a small, well-lighted parking lot right outside their side door.   I got there first and she came in a few minutes later, clearly upset.  After she parked her car and opened the door, a large man approached her, blocked her between the cars, and demanded money.  She told him she didn't have any and fortunately he backed off and disappeared, but she was very upset so that sort of set the tone for the evening.  We told the waiter, and he matter-of-factly told us that he had told the man not to ask people for money!!!  So apparently it is ok to frighten customers and block their path, as long as you don't ask for money.  He didn't offer to call the police, go out to the parking lot, or buy my friend a drink.  He just handed us the menus and walked off.

After all that, we ordered, and the food is plentiful, cheap and good.  There is a fairly extensive menu but we just ordered alacarte.   Filling, good, nicely seasoned.  We ended up splitting the enormous fried ice cream for dessert.

We were very careful going out to the parking lot after dinner and it was fine.  But beware, especially if you are alone."}
{"text":"Hola!

El Jalepenos (should be Los) is definitely the authentic Mexican place that they claim to be.  Personally I think the food up the street at Luchitas is a bit better, but you can't beat the atmosphere here.   It starts with the waiters who speak just enough English to get your order right and ends with the giant glasses of margaritas.

If you are looking for a fun time with no pretense, this is a great place to kick-off your night."}
{"text":"This is my first Mexican restaurant find and it's become a Monday night tradition. It's low cost, predictable and consistent food, always tasty.

Is it the best I've had? No. But great for a Monday night drink and dinner."}
{"text":"Great food fast service but watch out for the waiters niko was his name he served me and my family of 6 two times but this last visit guy loves to flirt which is disrespectful and come to find out this dude actually had the nerve to give extremely sexual comments to my kids mother which I didn't find out til about a hour ago . unfortunately I will not be returning to this place and hope management will correct this problem employees are there to work not to try and ruin a family"}
{"text":"not knowing where to go for dinner, a friend of mine said \"hey, so and so said that newer mexican place on 117th is always packed and pretty good.\"

so, we headed to the old kluck's.
i never reviewed kluck's, but i need to mention how hilarious i find it that it was a seafood joint named KLUCK'S.  i mean, right there- that must be why they closed.

ANYWAY

el jalapeno.  the name still could use some work.  but it was packed.  and what a phenomenal people watching experience that was.

the food is all numbered.  i ordered something by name and when the food came, they said the number.  i had no idea what number i ordered, nor should i.  so just a word to the wise:  remember your number.  because there was general confusion with the order, and apparently they brought out different food.  i wouldn't have even known.  it took two servers and a manager to figure that shit out.  and i mean, c'mon folks.  

the food wasn't horrible, but it wasn't amazing either.  would i go back?  if luchita's was closed, yes."}
{"text":"By far the best Authentic Mexican Restaurant around!!!!!!! Super fast, Super hot, Super FRESH!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, very tasty. The amount of food you receive is worth the price you pay. Fast, friendly staff. My hats off to the margaritas, one or two of those will most certainly take the winter out of the coldest days. My only two hangups are the bad lighting, which makes me feel like I'm in a dark damp cave somewhere, and the parking situation, as i almost got side swiped multiple times just trying to pull my car into one of those narrow spaces. Overall, definitely a place worthy of a second and third trip"}
{"text":"I tried coming here on Cinco de Mayo and found myself trapped in a snake of cars entering/leaving the overly packed parking lot. My first El Jalapeno's experience would need to wait. I came back a few weeks later with my roommate and the place was practically empty. The restaurant has an authentic Mexican feel to it. I sat at the bar, which had this giant glass shotgun glass bottle full of tequila above it. I wanted to ask the story behind it, but unfortunately the staff do not speak the greatest English. They were still attentive and able to get my order right though.

I ordered the chile relleno, refried beans and rice. The food came out super fast and was a gigantically overwhelming serving. I was determined to finish it all and definitely struggled to move for the next few hours. The menu is expansive and they definitely have every kind of Mexican dish you could want. I recommend going with on of the lunch specials - they charge $1 extra when rodering at dinner, which is kind of strange, but it's still the best deal available. I washed down the delicious Mexican food with a house margarita - which was okay, a little too sweet for my tastes. Definitely a solid place to grab some quick, authentic, cheap Mexican grub."}
{"text":"For being a place that cranks out Tex Mex like...it's their job...heh, this was not the best I've ever had. We came here pretty hungry, and while the chips and salsa took care of that (and were tasty--bonus!), the entree I had was bad enough to gag me. I can't even remember what I ordered right now because in reality, it was a plate of cheese. 

Let me just say that I LOVE cheese, but this was gross. The dish consisted of a thin layer of dried cheese on top (you know, that gummy cooked cheese layer that isn't quite right?) and an inch of cheese soup underneath. The chile relleno (that was what was supposed to be under there) was completely lost in the cheese that I was blindly gagging down, hoping that I could get some pepper in a bite. And if I did get any pepper in a bite, I didn't know it because the cheese was so strong with this one. 

I'd give this place another chance, but I definitely won't be ordering the relleno again. Hopefully that was just an accident, because everyone else at the table was satisfied and didn't have any issues with their food."}
{"text":"Dropped in for Lunch on Monday and was pleasantly surprised how good the food and service was! .Lunch menu is very reasonably priced with HUGE portions and the frozen Margaritas were great also.  I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Come on people. You know what to expect when you head out to a Mexican place that is located in an old seafood joint. That is exactly what you get. I leave satisfied. Plus, they serve Dr. Pepper.

I think the lower stars are due to the fact that some people might be expecting a bit trendier or authentic experience since the place is technically in Cleveland, and I agree it is a bit more of an outer-ring suburban Mexican dining experience, but it is decent for what it is. 

Although, I do remember being asked to leave because I was talking to my friend at another table. In fact, the waiter walked over to me and made a sweeping motion and said \"Shoo shoo. Your friends are done. You must go.\" He was not joking either."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick bite. Nothing special. The service was fine but the Mexican tacos had no chopped onion or cilantro on them. WTF is up with that?"}
{"text":"The best chicken fajitas in a Mex restaurant in CLE
  Great flavor and lots of chicken (unlike other places that serve you a pile of peppers and onions and a few pieces of chicken).  Always fast service."}
{"text":"Love this place! Huge margaritas! Good food! Good prices! Kid friendly!"}
{"text":"It's been a really long time since I've been to this place and I wasn't impressed with it before an from what I've been told they've had a change in management, staff and cooks.  So I came in since my one friend really wanted Mexican food so I wasn't going to order at first but since it was late and it would be a good while before I get home I decided to order and whoa.  The seafood chimichangas were quite delicious!!! The chips and salsa along with the margaritas and the staff.  Everything was definitely better than the last time I stepped in this place.  Keep it up and I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"El Jalapeño's is pretty standard Americanized Mexican food, with a few specials that stand out.  It is prepared well, and the staff are always friendly.  
My personal favorite meal is the Cazuelada - Steak, chicken, and chorizo sautéed with red bell pepper, mushrooms and onions, covered with cheese. Served with Mexican rice and charro beans, it is the one thing I keep coming back for, even though it's a bit more expensive than the majority of the meals at $16.50.
If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, this isn't the place, but it is good and reasonably priced and worth the try... Hit up that Cazuelada and I'm sure you'll be pleased!"}
{"text":"I really  like this place its a bit small & not alot of parking but the service  and food makes up for it. I will definitely  be  a regular. The food was amazing AUTHENTIC Mexican food. The waiters are very friendly  and very attentive  evendo it was very busy Saturday night"}
{"text":"The food, the drinks, the service, the prices and the atmosphere make Jalapeño's MY favorite place for Hispanic food. This place is so good I want to learn Spanish! 5 STARS!"}
{"text":"When I moved to Cleveland everyone said this was the place to go.  I have been about three times and I have been disappointed each and everytime.  While the portions are large the taste just isn't there.  Very bland for Mexican food and corners are cut."}
{"text":"I mean, its your typical americanized Mexican food. Unlimited chips and salsa, which are good, and big, cheap portions. The food comes out very quickly (we were done with our dinner in 45 minutes) and the service is great. They don't hover at the tables and are pretty nice.

It's good when you have a hankering for some Mexican food, but don't expect it to be the best quality. Yes, its good, but bland at times. I've had the spinach enchiladas, which are literally only stuffed with wilted spinach. I was expecting a little bit of cheese, some other veggies or sauce on the inside. Even a bit of salt would have been nice. There's only so much bland spinach you can eat. The red sauce on top also tasted exactly like it came out of a can. That was kind of disappointing.

Fajitas have to much oil, but they're decent and have a good sized portion. They unfortunately don't come with any of the normal toppings, like guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, or lettuce. Guacamole and Chile con queso are very good."}
{"text":"I came away thinking that if you lived in the neighborhood you could do worse than El Jalapeno's but if you don't live nearby then no need to bother.

Now, the main dining room seems a little tired and worn but there's a decent amount of TVs (showing the Indians' playoff game the night we were there) and the wait staff was very personable. I had no complaints about the quality and quantity of the margaritas (and there are plenty of options) and the food came out very fast.

The menu looked quite typical with about 80 menu items and I was feeling hungry so I went with the El Jalapeno's Special which included five different items. The best of the items was the pork tamale. Instead of being served in the corn husk it came out like a pancake sitting on top of shredded meat. The masa bread was not too dry while the pork was mouth-watering seasoned which spurred me to not put my fork down until it was all gone. Meanwhile, the beef taco, beef enchilada and the chalupa (as well as the beans and rice) were all fine, I guess. Then there was the chile rellano -- since I'm a carnivore I passed it on to one of our dining companions but I kept the plate full of water that I assume came from the chile.

Again, if I lived in the area and came enough to pinpoint the best menu items, I think I could enjoy the place. But right now I'm just glad that I live in a neighborhood with a Cozumel's."}
{"text":"The food was good, the place was smaller then I anticipated.  The margaritas were delicious. .I told the waiter to surprise me, it was so good. I asked the waiter what was it, he said raspberry.  I hate raspberry, but it was so good omg..lol....I ordered the Monterey.  It had a sample of everything. Food was good. The drinks were great."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic mexican food! Great experience! Fast service, fresh food! Love the drinks, and the salsa is addictive!"}
{"text":"I like it. 

The food is brought out so quickly I thought that they had perhaps brought me another tables order accidentally. 

They have a margerita that's about the size of a basketball for only $10!  Between that, the chips and salsa, and your actual meal there's no way in hell you're walking out of here feeling remotely hungry...for the next day or so.

The tacos are pretty good, but I come for the tamales.  The masa is dense, but not hard and dried out.  The beans and rice that accompany most meals are more of an after thought primarily used to fill up the rest of the platter your food comes on.

Oh, and to top it all off they have fried ice cream!

Your inner fat kid will approve!"}
{"text":"Authentic old world. Food is generally pretty good as well as the great service.
Extensive menu for all.
I eat here a few times a year..
Huge appetite? Order the fajitas which is actually enough for two people.
Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Service sucks food sucks go to Taco Bell you'd get better food. I only saw my waitress one time during the entire meal and that was when she brought the food out which was a wrong order might I add. This was my first time going here on a day it wasn't even busy and it was disappointing."}
{"text":"My last 2 visits to El Jalapeños have been nothing short of crap!
Service was painfully slow on both visits.  Neither time was the place terribly busy with customers.  My friend's margarita was nothing but margarita-mix syrup.  If you can't get a good margarita at a Mexican place.....
My sangria was out of a box.   *See same comment about where one should be able to fine a quality sangria.  
The food was BLAND!  As a vegetarian I asked if the rice was cooked in chicken stock.  The server looked at me like I was a moron.  When I explained why I asked that question, I was snapped at: \"NO!\"
I've never had problems here before, but when there are SO many quality Mexican restaraunts in the area, I will not be going back to El Jalapeños ever again."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a party of about 8. And the service was really great plus the food was good, so I thought I would give them another star. Everyone's drinks were refilled promptly although I wish they would invest in some water pitchers instead of taking my water away from me when it is almost empty to go fill it up at the fountain. I think the key is to not order anything too weird or shrimp and then their food is just what you would expect."}
{"text":"I *heart* mexican food. El Jalapenos does it well enough. Okay, so its only 3 blocks from my home -- that doesn't mean I'll give it unfair wager. In fact I don't go there much because ... well... I can't eat out all the time and am usually on the move away from home when eating out. Okay ... back to the mexican food. 

El Jalapenos first of all has really great atmosphere. They keep the lighting at the perfect level to be able to notice all of the decor and color spread throughout the restaurant. Also since there are only a few windows near the front of the establishment, the dining experience remains uninterrupted by the bustle of Lakewood on 117th St. It feels like I can escape to El Cardon for the afternoon or evening. 

Chips and salsa on the table for good measure as with any Mexicano joint. These ones are good, and I usually get spicy salsa or mix the habanero sauce in with the regular. 

Menu is a full-on mexicano menu as you would see at many other popular restaurants. Enchiladas verdes are usually my first pick. Always a staple item for me. The Grande Burrito is actually very impressive! Think 12in flour tortilla filled with fresh meats and vegetables, creamy sauce and sour creme. Nothing incredibly special just grande deliciousness. I've also heard their fajitas were pretty much spectacular but I'm not much of a connoisseur in that area. 

Service is quick and personal. I have occasionally found a slow waiter during a lunch hour when I had to eat and run but they're usually pretty good about it. Prices are average. A dinner for two with drinks would probably run you $28. Take a trip there. I like it. You might too."}
{"text":"I'm beginning to think that these restaurants are a carbon copy of another one, prepackaged in a box, shipped to a location complete with identical recipes, ingredients and even waiters. That somehow, these \"home cooking\" Mexican joints are nothing more than a Mexican upgrade to a Taco Bell, the Burger King of Mexican food.

I'm not complaining, only observing.

That said, this restaurant is the same restaurant as Fiesta Jalapeno, and strikingly similar to Si Senor, Cozumel, and El Rodeo. Each place has the same plates, and the same basic dishes without many -- and in some cases any -- changes between restaurants. And while that's okay, I'd love some sort of difference or at least a house specialty.

The food here is good. The portions are large, and pre-diet days, I could eat two baskets of chips and my meal with no problem. The Carnitas are wonderfully seasoned morsels of pork, poached in lard, and then fried to crispness. Their rice is moist and well done, and the beans are good, if a tad bit chalky.

I can't say a whole lot about El Jalapeno since it doesn't have much to stand and say for itself. It's good, basic Tex-Mexican food, and that's about that."}
{"text":"I honestly can't say how many time I've been to this place now, but I keep going back for a reason! The food is simply phenomenal, the drinks are spectacular, the service is friendly but not overbearing and the prices are perfect. I just absolutely love this place and recommend it to anyone who enjoys Mexican food."}
{"text":"This unassuming little spot settled into a stalwart seafood restaurant that closed and if you look closely, you can see the influence on the decor. But I digress. Unless the decor is black and white floor tiles (which drives me up a wall), I don't care about the decor I come for the food. 
I love the tamales at this place and will frequently get them to go.  Come to think of it, I'm gonna call Yelp everyday until the make me the Duke Emeritus.  Alright, back to reality, there is something to be said about unwrapping a folded corn husk that just slows you down and forces you to appreciate the efforts of your cook. Not to mention they are possibly the best motivator for an after hours crew of hungry skilled tradesmen.  It's also worth noting that I have never been disappointed with any of the other menu items.

Have a nice time and make sure to embarrass someone in your party by telling your server it's their birthday!"}
{"text":"It is a favorite of mine for dinner. My only complaint would be that they do not serve homemade tortillas. I feel that tortillas are easy enough to make, that an authentic Mexican restaurant should offer them, even if they were to charge additional. They also have Pepsi products."}
{"text":"During the course of my vacation in Cleveland and Canada, I ate a myriad of different food. On my last night before heading back South, my friends and I ended up at El Jalapeno's. Upon walking in I had mentioned to them that I thought it would be a great place for a Cinco de Mayo party, I was informed that apparently El Jalapeno's does great Cinco de Mayo parties. Something to consider when planning my next visit.

The restaurant, itself, is very homey. The lighting isn't too bright, nor is it too dark. It felt like I was walking into a dining room in someone's home rather than inside an establishment. I love this type of atmosphere. 

We were immediately provided chips and salsa while deciding on our order. As for drinks, we absolutely had to go with a pitcher of margaritas, but then the choice came down to what kind of margarita mix. El Jalapeno's has about ten different flavors along the lines of classic, strawberry, mango, peach, raspberry, and a few more. I'm typically a fan of classic margaritas, although, we settled on Peach. I wasn't sure what to expect out of it, but those Peach margaritas were damn tasty. 

This Tex Mex place has quite an extensive menu. It took me quite awhile just to read it before discovering the combination plate. You pick two items out of the following: burrito, pork tamale, quesadilla, enchilada, tostada, taco, chile relleno, chalupa, and chimichanga. After that, you choose whether you want re-fried or charro beans to go along with your rice. The plate that you get is pretty big and just $7.99, rather perfect for an someone like myself who can be indecisive when it comes to choosing food. 

I ended up with a burrito and a tamale, which came out of the kitchen at lightning speed, along with the rest of our order. I finished the tamale (as they are my all time favorite when it comes to Mexican food), but took the burrito and the re-fried beans home. It wasn't just myself; all three of us in our party left with doggie bags and full tummies."}
{"text":"Yummy and authentic Mexican food!

I ordered vegetarian fajitas and a raspberry margarita - both were VERY tasty! My date wished he had ordered fajitas too when the waitress brought the sizzling cast iron skillet to our table! Fresh, delicious bell peppers, zucchini, yellow squash, mushrooms and cauliflower with corn tortillas. 

The portions were incredibly generous here. I ate until I was stuffed and still had enough leftovers for another full meal at home the next day. The raspberry margarita was really sweet and a little strong, but still tasty. Our waitress was great - and we had very fast service.

I've only been here once but will definitely return!"}
{"text":"What can I say? This place has it all, good service, good food and affordable prices. I live about 20 minutes away and there are two Mexican restaurants within 10 minutes of my house... Yet, I continue to make the drive to El Jalapeno's. I'll let that speak for itself!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place but our server was clearly frazzled. I tried to keep her calm, and keep my neediness to a minimum -- as a former server, I understand how it can be. It was busy, and the manager or owner came out to help the servers with their tables. Happy hour prices and good intentions helped bring this 3-star to a 4. Food was pretty good in my book."}
{"text":"This is my \"go-to\" Mexican restaurant. I'm never afraid to order anything new off the menu because it's all delicious. Portions are huge. Affordable prices. I even look forward to the salsa and chips they bring out to the table. My favorites are the fajitas, margaritas(of course) and the Chile Reino (off the a la cart menu). And if you can fit desert you should definitely try their fried ice-cream. YUM! Service for the most part is pretty good. Felix is awesome. And if its your birthday you get to wear sombrero and they sing a song in Spanish for you."}
{"text":"I lived right around the corner from El Jalapeno's and dined there usually once a week. The servers are always friendly and like many mexican restaurants the portions are generous. The guacamole and carnitas were my favorites. It's a nice play to go for margaritas and a casual dinner."}
{"text":"Overpriced and food was so-so. Margaritas were strong but watery. Big portion sizes but lacking in flavor. Service was slow despite the restaurant being somewhat empty. Very smoky inside as well"}
{"text":"Would that there was a review just for a margarita because these, my friends, are winners. Not too sweet, just tasty, boozy and a wee bit sour. Perhaps the best I've had in too long a time. 

Order up: One el Jalapeno special - an excellent tamale, delicious chili relleno, stuffed taco, beef enchilada and one other element that I'm forgetting. Way too much food for little old me, but you know it's a good sign when you're not even finished with your leftovers and you're already plotting your return trip."}
{"text":"I don't know why I never think of this place for take-out, but when I was craving fajitas last night and the beau wasn't it hit me...

Order some to-go for yourself! 

I did and it was cheap and quick as hell. The food was good, yet not as good as when you're fajitas are scorching hot, sizzling in front of you on one of those cast iron skillets. It was missing that caramelized goodness it gets as it continues to cook in front of you. But, the seasoning and most of the flavor was still there. 

I also ordered some salsa and chips to-go. The salsa made me laugh, since it was sent in a styrofoam drink cup (still delicious, though!) But the chips lacked their usual salt and were a bit stale. 

Either way, still a great go-to Ameri-Mexican restaurant that's close, quick and cheap."}
{"text":"I'm guessing there isn't much competition ....

Went with a gaggle of friends on a Sunday afternoon. I was first taken aback by the atmosphere - while it was bright and sunny outside, inside was dark and dusty. And to add to the dust, someone was vacuuming and stirring dust clouds as sunlight from the two front windows tried to penetrate the abyss. The place was moderately busy, so I took that as a good sign.

Started with margaritas and chips & salsa. The chips were great (1/2 star). The margaritas were the worst I've had - it was as if the sour mix was lime Kool-aid (negative stars if possible). Baffled. My friend and I tried our best to figure out what we were drinking. I ended up with flautas, which were crispy but a little over-deep fried (1/2 star). The rest of my friends had plates that were piled high (one star), and they took their leftovers home - so that hopefully says something. 

Alas for me, it doesn't say enough."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a different Mexican restaurant while on vacation. I was a little disappointed by my camarones del pacifico. It did come out sizzling on a cast iron griddle with mixed peppers and onions. Although, the bacon was crispy I could hardly taste the shrimp with a sliver of jalapeno and I doubt there was in cheese stuffed in there. My charro beans were good. They were cooked with pieces of bacon. Pour them over the Mexican rice and it's a meal in itself. My husband ordered two chicken chimichangas with double rice no refried beans. He cleared the plate. The virgin pina coladas I could tell were from a pre-made mix with ice. Not sure if I will personally make the drive to go back."}
{"text":"Warning: This might be the most pretentious review I've ever written, as it sounds like I think I'm awesomely cool for having lived in LA. Honestly, that couldn't be farther from the actual truth, as I'm pretty damned aware of my own absolute lack of cool. And having lived in LA certainly doesn't qualify one for extra cool points. (I think Cleveland is cooler anyway. See? I am so not cool.) But having lived in a city where Mexican food is a way of life... well, it's relevant to qualifying my review. So keep that in mind before you read on, k? Thanks. 

I lived in Los Angeles for a few years before I moved to Cleveland. One of the few (very few) things that I actually miss about living in LA is the Mexican food. It's not that there's more \"authentic\" food there. (Side note: That's always a kind of dubious claim anyway. When anyone claims to have authentic Mexican food - as El Jalapeno's does in big red letters on the side of the garish orange building - I always wonder \"authentic to what area of Mexico?\" It's a large country. There are quite a few different variations of cuisine that are \"authentic\" to Mexico. But I digress.) 

It's that there are just so many Mexican joints in LA - of various levels of quality and taste - that you really don't have to look hard to find a favorite Mexican place. Or a couple of favorites, or a half dozen favorites. 

Here in NEO, I've had a much harder time finding those favorites. It took a long time to find one, much less a few. When I first moved here 10 years ago, I solicited recommendations from the natives, though I gave that up after a couple of years of routinely being disappointed by places that I'd been promised were \"The Best Mexican in Cleveland.\" In the last few years there have been a few that have managed to be marked in my head as favorites... though sometimes I wonder if it's just because I've not been back to LA in 10 years to Mexico City or Paco's Tacos or that little place on Hollywood Blvd with the awesome mole, and I've forgotten... Eh, either way, I've got a few go tos for Mexican now. El J is the closest one to where I live, so I end up there semi-regularly.

Is El Jalapeno's the best? Nah, I don't really think it's the best, though I still don't think I've had traditional Mexican here that I'd even want to classify as the best. But it's solidly tasty and inexpensive Mexican food, served SUPER FAST by (usually) friendly folks (The service can be hit or miss. I've had servers there that were cheerful and awesome, and I've had servers that clearly would like to throw a margarita in my face. So your mileage may vary on that end.) and the atmosphere and decor are pretty standard fare for your average Mexican joint with some TVs thrown in for extra distraction. Not super classy by any stretch, but not a total dive either. 

The fajitas are yummy and enough for 2 meals easily, the chimichangas have been decent, and a fellow former LA resident swears by the steak tacos (I think it's the al pastor variety that he digs the most) and that is all he ever orders when we go there. I have this weird craving for the \"Steak a la Mexicana\" (a thin ribeye with tomatoes, onions, and jalapenos) every so often - it's not a great steak by any standard, and don't even bother asking to have it cooked anything less than well done, because that's what you're going to get, but strangely, I dig it. (I'm usually a snob about steaks being at LEAST pink inside. But in this case... I dunno. The veggie combo just works with the well done meat I guess.) The only food bit I'd advise away from is the guac - tried it a couple of times and just found it bland... skip that and go for the greasy (and I mean that in a good way) fundido instead. 

This isn't foodie fancy Mexican, but satisfies a craving for Mexican comfort food whenever I need it."}
{"text":"This weekend I rekindled a dying romance between me and El Jalapeno.  I went here with a girlfriend for dinner on Friday night and was reminded of how much I enjoy it.  We split a pitcher of the margaritas (Don't judge.)  and they really have outstanding margaritas-the perfect blend of boozy, tasty and the right amount of sweet.  The service was great, we sat there for a long time and chatted, and the server kept coming by and refilling our margarita glasses for us.  This was greatly appreciated, as I have little confidence that I could master the spoon/ice pouring technique with the panache he was able to use.  Now to the food: it really is solidly good Mexican food.  I've been here a number of times, and almost always tend towards the fajitas-that was what I went with this time.  The portions are gigantic, and the food was brought out really hot and fresh.  I also remember the time I got a burrito from here and it came out and was nearly the size of my arm.  And also the time my dining companion pronounced \"queso\" like \"kway-so\" and the server just smiled and nodded without even the slightest tinge of judgment (which is more than I could say for myself.)  Suffice it to say, I've never had a bad experience here.  It is a little dark-probably wasn't the best choice for the bright and sunny day we went.  The parking can also be a little tight.  But overall, I'd highly recommend.  Good food, good booze, good staff.  What more could a girl (or boy, or androgynous being) want?"}
{"text":"Stopped in at El Jalapenos for lunch on a whim, since I have driven by it so many times; I am so happy I did.  Located in a standalone building, brightly painted, you enter on the side from the parking lot.  The inside is old school knotty pine with plenty of Mexican accents which results in a warm comfortable atmosphere with a welcoming feel.  Warm fresh chips and a zippy salsa hit the table quickly and are very well done.

The menu is extensive, mainly classic Mexican dishes.   I went for the Chili Relleno lunch with beans and rice. The dish came out in about 5 minutes on a colorful plate. 

Chili Relleno is my go to item to try a new Mexican place and El Jalapenos delivered as few places have.  The dish came out with one perfectly cooked nice sized pepper stuffed with cheese, dipped in batter and fried.   The pepper was just the right level of spicy heat, tongue tingling without burning out my taste buds, covered in a nice eggy batter and nicely fried.  The cheese was just enough to provide a nice mild contrast to the pepper, without overwhelming it.  The pablano sauce gave a nice tang, if anything I would have wanted more.  The refried beans and rice were both very good; the beans smooth and flavorful with the rice being just moist enough.

Service started very good and went downhill as the lunch proceeded; water was not refilled quickly, then I had to wait far too long and make as specific request to get my bill.  I am hoping this was not usual.

El Jalapenos is a great place for classic Mexican dishes, they do excellent renditions and the Chili Relleno was one of the best I have had.  Prices are slightly higher then some other restaurants around town, but the quality is worth it."}
{"text":"Love it.  Huge fan.  While In grew up going to Luchita's and loyal to them...This place isjust as good.  The food comes out as fast as you order it.  No joke how fast it comes out.  I'm a bigger fan of their house salsa as opposed to other places as well.  Parking lot is usually packed and thats always a good sign.  The bathrooms are TINY but it's not like I'm planning on doing cartwheels in there.  While they do have a bar, this place closes around 10pm most nights.  I will continue to go here and remain a fan"}
{"text":"Really clean place, Good staff and very good food. Mexican salsa ia good and spicy and its a unique little place authentic and pretty good for families."}
{"text":"Sooo good!! I've been craving good Mexican food for the past 3 years since I moved from New York and I've finally found my new go-to place!

For my first time here, I decided to get some simple dishes, difficult to mess up, just to see how they fared. I got nachos with ground beef, jalepenos and cheese with a side of salsa and guac. The nachos were delicious but unfortunately the chips were soggy since they had been sitting there a few minutes before I came to pick them up. The guac was fresh but needed some salt. The salsa was slightly spicy which was also nice

I got 4 tacos- 2 al pastor, 1 bistec, and 1 chorizo. My fav was chorizo, al pastor was pretty good, bistec needed some seasoning but like I said, the salsa is pretty good. Each order came with a side of chips

The restaurant is pretty cute so I think I'll sit in and eat there next time and try out their infamous margaritas... They looked huge!"}
{"text":"Thus is my second time here.....today is not busy at all and I been waiting on my food for over 13 minutes now......service is slow....sort of pricey....not sure if I would come back here...."}
{"text":"Ever heard the term, \"Once you go black you never go back\"? Well same goes for this place. Once you go here you won't go to any other Mexican restaurants. 

  Everything from the service, speed the meal came to us and it's freshness to the price; amazing! All the fajitas are amazing too, but portions on the seafood fajitas were a little stingy. Still amazing though"}
{"text":"While this may be a family friendly place, the blandness of the food leaves a lot to be desired. I gave this place three opportunities and was disappointed at every turn. 

The salsa tastes like tomato juice with an accident of garlic powder and black pepper. We ordered the sincronazada, a staple of Mexican cantinas, and was shocked to get a slice of Isaly's chip-chopped ham, some low-quality cheese and a tortilla. It didn't have the good chihuahua cheese or smoky ham that it should have had. That was a notable disappointment. Again the rest of the food was bland and not worth mentioning. 

This is a total skip-- not worth the time at all. Drive an extra couple miles and head to Villa y Zapata and get their Chile Rellenos, which are bar none the best in the region, or go to Luchitas. If you don't care about authentic flavours, head down to Barrio or El Carnicero for some quality!"}
{"text":"Sizzling and juicy, that's how my fajita dish came out.  YES PLEASE.  I got the seafood fajita dish and I really liked the shrimp in my dish...but the supposed scallops were almost too tiny to tell, hence the downgrade.  There were about 5-6 mussels and tons of veggies, which were delicious.  The side dish of rice, beans, lettuce, guac and tomatoes was so so compared to some of the other mexican resturants I have tried but overall not bad.  I'm a huge guac fan and I didn't quite get the same satisfaction from this one :(  The ambiance is relaxed with a very open space for eating.  The waitors were awesome and the staff nice.  I would definetly come back out here :)"}
{"text":"This place certainly cures my Mexican food cravings. As soon as I was seated, the waiter brought out the chips & salsa. The salsa has a bite to it but it was very good. I ordered the #29 Enchiladas Supremas & really enjoyed it! It came with 4 different enchiladas & rice. The rice was really good & it wasn't over cooked. My boyfriend got the fajitas & it was so tasty! 

The service is fast & the waiter was attentive. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"They have really good food - if they get your order right. I usually just get rice and beans and cheese dip to not complicate things. Anytime I've order something else, they get the order wrong and explaining how to fix it is rough. The prices are also a little ridiculous. Your receipt doesn't specify what cost what and it is too much work to challenge the pricing of stuff. If their food weren't so good, I wouldn't go there."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food. Its probably my favorite cuisine. I have eaten here maybe 5 times. Problems all 5 times. Either the order was wrong, no refills or lack luster service. Worst was when an older person used the restroom ( which is gross)  I went in after and saw urine all over the toilet and floor. Bless her heart she must have missed. I told the server. He sent in another guy. Guy came out, said no no urine anywhere and walked away. I went back in, YES THERE WAS!! I asked for my bill and left. never again."}
{"text":"Decent margaritas. Rotating, yet attentive, service. Killer queso. Warm-n-salty chips. Ya know - the usual. 

What was all but usual - quite unusual really - were the wood paneled walls. Straight outta grams basement!

All considered, it's pretty cheap for the giant serving sizes, and just the way I wanted to spend my gloomy Saturday afternoon while in Cleveland: Afternoon margs, endless chips and salsa, good company, and did I mention the margaritas?"}
{"text":"Love this place! Margaritas are amazing! Kid friendly! The staff is really nice."}
{"text":"Incredible food,  huge portions, and wonderful service. Great place to grab lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic Mexican food!  I tried El Jalapeños for the first time today.  I ordered a burrito to take home and while I waited for the food, I admired the painted chairs, hanging lights and lanterns and friendly, helpful staff.  Cannot wait to go again!"}
{"text":"wa wa wa waaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.....

that's the sound of the disappointment I had from visiting this place. It's definitely not as good as the restaurant it replaced (Klucks). Cozumel in the old IHOP down detroit is MUCH better than this place. Then again, so is the friggin chipotle in the Marc's plaza.

Server seemed more interested in the TV than serving us (also, there were three employees hanging out at the bar, either overstaffed, or just lazy).

Food was not good. We've been to many mexican places in Columbus, and the food here was bland and at sometimes, had off flavors. The tomato with my dish was cut off the top, and my wife's tomato slice had a big black spot on it.

So if you like questionable mexican food, you can have a great time here. Sure the margaritas are big, but they're also eight bucks. $2.50 for a bottle of tecate (you can get a larger can for like $1 at a 7-11).

First time I've had a bad experience in the Lakewood area. Thanks El Jalapenos!"}
{"text":"I really appreciate the service that I receive at this joint! Onesimo is one of the best bartenders in town! If you want to warm up b4 heading downtown, you should get your prime on hete! The prices are fair and you can never go wrong! Just stop 1 time!"}
{"text":"You can't ever go wrong with the Taco Tuesdays here.  They are only $1.25 each and they have a good variety of fillings to choose from such as chicken, chorizo and ground beef.  You can have them crunchy or soft and they have a toppings bar where you can fill up on as much lettuce, salsa and sour cream as you want.  They also have a buy one get one half off deal on Margartias, however, I'm not a big fan.  I always stick with the beer or a Jarrito.  Save room for the Fried Ice Cream, it is so damn worth it =)"}
{"text":"Im confused why this place has such high stars.  Came on a Friday night and the place was packed.  I have been here a few times since Klucks closed and it became this place.  Still looks like Klucks but with a random sombrero and maracas hanging around.  The only thing Mexican about it is the people working.  Didn't even see any Mexicans eating at any of the tables.  Not a good sign.  In past times I left feeling \"It was OK\"...this time it just felt blah.  To quote John Lydon: \" Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?\"  That's how I feel now.  Girl working our section was super nice and fast but the food and drank was crap.  No flavor.  Drinks were watery (even though we payed more for the Texana).  The salsa even tasted watered down.  Even for gringo/messican this is bad.  Hell, even Cozumel up the road is better.  Aren't they all owned by the same people anyway?  I miss Mi Pueblo.  Maybe I will have to drive out to Painesville for real tacos...or hit up La Plaza, deal with the occasional hip, foodie type that seems to infested this bastion of Mexican grocery goodness and just make my own. 

Larga vida a la mano izquierda cabra"}
{"text":"The worst mexican food, burned and just a pile of literally crap!! Im never going back. Just gross, bland and unappealing"}
{"text":"A spot we will definitely return to! The service was fast, the atmosphere and prices were comparable to other Mexican restaurants, and  the food arrived quick and was yummy!  Not to mention our waiter was easy on the eyes ;-)"}
{"text":"I thought the food was very good! Especially since just moving from LA it tasted very authentic! They have huge portions and I was able to take home a lot of left overs. The service was good and the food came out very fast.

I think it was a little pricey but that's my only complaint. I was able to order off of the vegetarian portion of the menu which was a little cheaper. Very yummy salsa and chips too! Worth checking out if you're craving Mexican food :)"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE Mex joint! I hear they have another establishment in the area also, where is it so I can make it #2 on my list?"}
{"text":"Great service, Awesome margaritas and amazing food for the price!!!  Margaritas are so smooth!!!  Love it!  My favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Ole! I freakin' love this place. The staff is friendly. The food is awesome. The service is really quick. The best part is, the lunch menu is cheapsies. You can get a really filling, delectable Mexican meal and a (non alcoholic) drink for $9. This is the perfect Friday coworker lunch spot."}
{"text":"Loveeeeeee this Mexican restaurant! First off we loved how big the menu was and the combo options! The servers were very nice and could actually understand me which was a great change! The food was amazing and I loved how I could customize it to my liking without feeling annoying. All around very impressed and wish we could frequent more! Only complaint is that the salsa was VERY spicy!"}
{"text":"Not sure if im spoiled from california mexican food or not, but this just tastes off.... Not very good quality. 

Great customer service. Very nice staff."}
{"text":"Ya know when you crave a certain cuisine? I was craving Mexican a'la Athens, Ohio (casa nueva and rio grande, thank you very much), and El Jalapeno's went above and beyond in fulfilling my expectations (and my boyfriend's).

Simply:
1) Satisfying, heaping helpings of steaming hot *authentic* Mexican dishes 
2) Surprisingly cool atmosphere. It had real character and made me feel like I was transported to another place (specifically, Mexico)
3) The service was really really great.
4) We will be back for more. =)"}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour food and drink specials in town!!  The kids love the Tacos and the grown-ups love the margaritas."}
{"text":"Always the right portion at the right price. This a classic Mexican restaurant done right and the food is in par with any Mexican food."}
{"text":"It's pretty standard fare. It seems a bit expensive for the quality, but you tend to get a lot of food for the price. I made three meals out of the quesadilla de fajitas. We got a pitcher of margs and I wasn't a fan."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for an affordable, quick and delicious foods. I've been coming here for years and haven't been disappointed.  I usually get the quesadilla grande and add chipotle sauce to it.  It's under 10 bucks, fills me up and the ingredients are always fresh. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is a lovely place , i really like it it was my first time trying Mexican food and I like it . The little problème was the rice was salty a little bit , but I like it ."}
{"text":"Fast service, delicious food.  I got the spinach enchiladas, and they were stuffed full of yummy spinach, my favorite veggie.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A good lunch time spot.   The service is typically excellent with delicious food.   Their price point is a little higher, but the service and food quality make up for it.    Everyone that I have had lunch enjoys their meal.   I have tried the nachos and the chicken with rice.    Their salsa is AMAZING!!!!   Definitely worth a try!!!!"}
{"text":"El Jalapeños is my new favorite neighborhood Mexican restaurant. We were seated immediately at a comfortable booth. We were promptly greeted by our server. The service was wonderful. Food cake out quickly and was very delicious. The cost of our meal was also reasonably priced. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food here definitely satisfied. I went with my friend and his 6 year old daughter. They have a kid's menu, which is a good thing. My friend's kid kept asking why the waiter kept filling up my glass of water. I explained that this is good service. She also told me this story: 
\"I was in Amish today, and saw a horse that had 5 legs.\"
I told her of the time that I saw a cow before with 6 legs while on a trip through Kansas (See review for Prarie Dog Town, Oakley, KS. Or check this link: http://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/11444). My friend then explained that she was referring to the horse's you know what! I will never forget this hilarious dining experience."}
{"text":"Good margs, good food, decent service! Would give 6 stars but sometimes service can be slow. Love the environment - fun & colorful space. Get the JUMBO MARG!"}
{"text":"Always great food, however after running up over a $100 bill the service quickly stopped.  The bill came and after that our waters were never refilled, which seemed like a way to say Adios!   Anyway still one of the best Mexican restaurants in Cleveland.  I would certainty recommend.  Next time will order a picture of water!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite mexican food anywhere in Cleveland. It is always amazing. Lunch is the best time to go 7$ will get you a huge plate of food! The margaritas are good too!"}
{"text":"El Jalapeños is 'all-up-en-yo' face with its deliciousness... and if you missed that amazing pun, it's possible that the tastiness of El Jalapeños' eatery might be lost on you as well... and that my friends, would be a shame.

The ambiance was a super authentic Mexican vibe with fun lights, great decor and robust colors. The air was filled with the sweet sweet smell of steaming meats and veggies, ayyyeeee - sizzling fajitas! 

The first thing (naturally) that caught my eye as I entered was the Specials board where a 42 oz. Margarita was proudly displayed. $11.99 you say? Was there ever such a bargain more worthy of my time? The answer is no, my amigos & amigas! What more pleasant way to spend one's Sunday than sipping on a fine blend of citrus and tequila (which can be shared, but definitely doesn't have to be ;) - turn down for what?)

After ordering a taco, it was pointed out that they had a lil' taco bar toppings station, which for a lover of pickled jalapeños and endless sour cream, I was one happy chica. The tacos were a steal of a deal - $2.99, and definitely provided a strong serving of meat! 

I saved the very best part of this review for last, because for a senorita who sticks to beef enchiladas and shredded chicken tacos on the reg, a new dish swept in and stole my Mexi-heart. The El Tapatio did me in, ya'll. The perfectly seasoned grilled chicken breast cut into fine pieces with a mildly spicy sausage, topped with a melted cheese that is LITERALLY making my mouth water, came out of left field and hit me by surprise. Good heavens! I am not one to typically order the \"build your own\" scenario - but this would be something I would TOTALLY get in the future. I was lucky that my dinner companion, the real MVP of this story, shared! 

Seriously I am salivating right now thinking about that chicken. Send help; I need an El Jalapeños support group! Too bad my face is plastered all over this page and I'm not anonymous at all! I guess there's just no shame in my EJ game!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to differentiate between Mexican restaurants.  They have beans, taco meat, sour creme, sombreros, and those delicious chips that just keep coming.  For once though, I'm going to differentiate.  El Jalapeno's is hot stuff!  

I ordered the Chicken in Poblano sauce and my bf ordered the Camarones del Pacifico.  On any normal day I'd be perfectly happy with my well flavored chicken drenched in this creamy chili sauce...Mmm!  Ok, well, not completely today.  How can it compete against a huge plate of fajita toppings, a bowl of amazing chili bean spice and umm...bacon wrapped shrimp?  Yea.  I knnnoowwww..

It may be hard for the typical Yelp reader to gauge anything on this, but my bf called his meal \"magical\".  I don't think that's ever happened before, in fact, I don't think I've heard anything beyond the scale of \"pretty good\" before.  What's that mean?  You need to order the Camarones del Pacifico!  

Other than that, the meals are well priced with heaping portions, the wait staff is quick and attentive, the margaritas are strong (till you get distracted by the amazing food in front of you and realize all the ice melted and watered it down) and they had the movie Selena playing.  I love it!"}
{"text":"Great local place in Edgewater/ Lakewood. Extremely fast service, and the two times we have been in, we couldn't have been happier. 
Traditional straight up old school Mexican food. Perfect."}
{"text":"Solid authentic Mexican food. I was turned off by the name, but the food is good. Taco bar for salsas and whatnot. Homemade chips. Solid margaritas. I say give it a go. Fast lunches, filling dinners."}
{"text":"I've been to Fiesta Jalapenos (same owner) before and was told that El Jalapenos exists MUCH closer to home than Fiesta- so when a friend and I had a craving for mexican, I suggested this place. I'm pretty conflicted when writing this review... positives and negatives... and don't know which outweighs the other... which is why I'm giving this place 3 stars- smack dab in the middle. 

Positives:
- The food WAS good. The chips and salsa are addicting and we ordered the Queso- YUM! I had the Vegetarian Fajitas, which were good- but (you'll see in my Negatives) didn't come out on a sizzler like my friends' Fajitas did... Confused.... :-\
- The strawberry margarita was DELICIOUS! strong and delicious!!! One of my friends had a plain marg and hers was good too. My other friend had the peach daiquiri and loved it, too!
- Food comes out quick- there was a big party, and that didn't affect the speed of our food and I noticed shortly after the big party ordered, their food came rolling out. Not sure how they do it, but the food still seems pretty fresh. 

Negatives:
- It was LITERALLY a SAUNA in the restaurant- it was insanely hot. It was hot and sticky- Granted it was the one 50 degree night in January, but still- turn down your heat....?? 
- The service was pretty bad- I know there was a big party, but it seemed like there were a few people standing around the front while our waiter took the big party's orders and catered to everyone else in the room. My friends water was empty and we placed her empty glass at the end of the table, must have been over 10 minutes before it was refilled... Our waiter was the one that asked if we wanted more margaritas, we said sure, then 10 minutes later he walked by and a look of recognition went over his face and he rushed to put those marg orders in... My friends fajitas came on a skillet sizzling, while mine came on a plate, which was fine- they still tasted fine, but I didn't get the lettuce, guac, sour cream, cheese toppings plate . So I requested it. 
-it didn't help that the waiter barely spoke english and would just stare at us and laugh until he realized what we wanted... :-
- There was a fruit fly that died in my margarita... 

Overall- it was okay- the service and sauna sucked... but the food and drinks may be more than enough to bring me back!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to say I love the chimi changas, everyone is usually nice but the last time I went the guacamole didn't seem fresh but refrigerated only reason I say that is because the bowl was cold and so was the guacamole,  kinda disappointing when that's the second thing I go there for!"}
{"text":"This is your typical quickie Mexican place. Not my favorite but not the worst. Expect quick, cheap food. Parking can be a hassle but that's pretty much par for the course in Lakewood!"}
