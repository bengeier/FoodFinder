{"text":"Average food with absolute the worst attitude you can expect from the owner. I personally don't like over cooked duck skin, so I wanted to look at both pieces for a second time, the woman start to scold so loud even people at the supermarkets cashier could hear her. \"You are a bad customer and I don't want you.\" Will never go back to this place ever again. If you want to be treated with equal respect and freshly cooked food, then you are at the wrong place. 

Found two hidden reviews describing the same thing."}
{"text":"quick. Fast. Efficient and really nice owner! Come here for your favorite BBQ Duck, Pork, and Delicious Steamed chicken. He also has other combo deals that serve dim sum and rice dishes as well.  I always get the BBQ duck and BBQ pork here and it never disappoints.  Just make sure you always bring cash of course.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is for take-out only beside the supermarket. Food and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm a fan for my most recent experience here. 

Ordered their stir fried vermicelli ($4.99) - big box of vermicelli. Lots of shrimp (and good sized shrimp at that), BBQ pork, and julienned veggies. Good stuff.

Also got their shredded pig ears ($4.99/box) - heavy on the sesame oil. A tad firmer than I'd like, but just a tad. Tasty stuff. Not the cheapest place to get pig ears, but I was having a craving.

Got a box of duck wings for grandpa. Accidentally dropped them on the floor and the box popped open and spilled. The owner said that it was fine and that he'd make us a new box. I said I'd pay for the old one as well, but he said not to worry about it. We cleaned it up and afterwards, he washed his hands (plus one for sanitization!). He also got me tissues so I could wipe my hands. The new box he got us was even bigger than the old box, and he intentionally put sauce on it for us! This whole exchange was super nice of him."}
