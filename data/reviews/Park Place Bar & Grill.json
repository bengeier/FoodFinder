{"text":"I went to Park Place for brunch with my friends to celebrate my birthday and had a beyond exceptional experience. We were the largest, loudest group in the restaurant but our waiter, Matthew, took it in stride and kept a smile the entire time. We did bottomless mimosas and they brought our table a bottle of mimosas on ice, as soon as it was empty they brought another; VERY worth the $15. When our bills came Matthew had comped my breakfast because it was my birthday which meant so much more than he knew. A man (who I'm assuming in the owner or manager) came in just before we were about to leave and came over to check that everything met our expectations, he was very personable. Overall I highly recommend this place for the amazing staff and fantastic service. I chose the restaurant because I didn't want to deal with the wait at any of the popular brunch spots in old town but this turned into a very special birthday experience for me. I will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, amazing drinks, relaxing atmosphere. A great patio! What more could you want? Paul did a great job with this place. I can easily see this being the next hot local hang out! Really enjoyed live music there on Sunday am as well."}
{"text":"I came to this place thinking I was going to orange table. I was a little bummed at first but the new owner was very nice and even offered us a quick tour. Still I was craving the french press coffee and red hash. I was pleasantly surprised to find they were still on the menu. Another pleasant surprise was the great music from the guitar player outside. Not sure if he is there all the time, we were there on Saturday, but he is awesome. The food came quickly, not something orange table was famous for, and it was delicious. When this place is discovered im probably gonna be mad I posted this review but it still feels like the right thing to do. Try it. You'll thank me"}
{"text":"Fun, relaxed atmosphere, good food,  feel good genre of music playing outside on the patio. Relaxed, kicked back ambience in the center of Scottsdale. Non pretentious and just easy going.  The bottomless Mimosa's and Bloody Mary's don't hurt either!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Bottomless mimosas and bloody Marys till 4 on weekends, great food and its dog friendly. Perfect for brunch or lunch date"}
{"text":"These guys are my new best friends. This amaxing restaurant was recommended by a friend and they exceeded expectations by miles. We came for spring training and they had these amazingly cool posters from budweiser and the nicest man named  ryan   gave me one of the posters. If you are in the area and even if you arent make the detour its worth it. He even found their shipment of  sourdough."}
{"text":"Did a Groupon deal for this place and, after eating there, almost felt badly about it because the food was SO good that it deserved full payment!!  I never ever do reviews, but my husband told me I really should do a plug for this restaurant as it was THAT good.  The service was excellent -- very accommodating with the menu and our choices for our two small girls.  The french toast with berries was literally the best we've ever had.  Huge thanks!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and portions much better than anticipated. All food was of great quality. Had the bottomless bloody Mary and though somewhat pricey, were very good. Go."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The food is scratch made and delicious! James, our server was great,  very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. I recommend the Loki sandwich it was flavor packed and oh so fresh! We will definitely visit Park Place Bar & Grill again!"}
{"text":"Bottomless Mimosa Brunch....Here for a Birthday,  ask for Matthew.  He will make it a great time..  It is a must go for Brunch.."}
{"text":"I really love this restaurant. It's dog friendly and the service is always exceptional. They usually also have live music, so all around great atmosphere! My only complaint is I wish they have a few vegan dishes, or had some applesauce and margarine in their kitchen that they could use as a replacer for eggs and butter for any vegans that would like to try their pancakes."}
{"text":"This is an absolute must for brunch! We are from San Francisco and found this place online. It did not disappoint! Live music, bottomless mimosa and AMAZING food! We had the jalapeño cakes and chimichirri hash. The staff is super attentive and friendly. If we lived here we would make this a regular spot!"}
{"text":"For Sun brunch I tried the White Flannel. Two eggs, home-made corned beef hash, bacon and english muffin .. Yum!"}
{"text":"We finally stopped in for brunch and we will be returning very soon.  I had the monkey cakes and they were very good.  These were better than the pancakes they served when this restaurant was Orange Table.  I love the transformation of this place too - the decor, staff, music and food. I can see this becoming a favorite spot in Old Town."}
{"text":"love this place, breakfast is amazing, live entertainment at night.. wow they have it all! Great food and a full bar. 4 adults, 2 appitizers, 4 dinners, 5 coctails and 2 sodas under $100.00 where can you do that in Scottsdale?"}
{"text":"It should be one star, I will get to that...   Arrived early for a show on a Saturday night, place was empty.  You would think you could get service quickly then eh?   But no.  Out of the two staff members we saw all night, one seemed real confused.  Had an app, was good, dinner, was real good.  The live music was great.      We were joined by friends and one asked for a sipping tequila, rocks.  The confused waiter suggested a Patron with orange slices and cinnamon.   OK fine.  Looked good I ordered one as well.   She had two and nothing else.     She gets her bill and the Patron's were 22.00 EACH.  Who does that?   Recommends something that is ridiculously high priced and never mentioning the cost.  Bush league.   Boo hiss.     Insult to injury as we left, there is a sign at the door that has a Patron bottle with a message that says 8.00 Patron Shots."}
{"text":"Went here for a late breakfast. Great seating on a beautiful patio overlooking the park. I loved the flannels at Orange Table which was the old name of this place and was worried they would be gone, but nope luckily still here. I had the green flannel and it was great. There happened to be live music and bottomless mimosas which were both nice surprises. I will definitely be back and recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went to breakfast this morning and there was no wait! Nestled in the heart of old town. Great spot for a great relaxing environment."}
{"text":"Unlimited Mimosas ... pricey actually ... the food?  Mixed reviews from members in my party.  A few Sundays ago a planned brunch for 3 turned into an impromptu brunch for 12 and Park Place was so accommodating to us.  Literally it was like every time our waitress, Chelsea came back to out table asking if we needed anything or dropping something off, there was a new person at he table or 2.  She didn't mind at all and she kept the mimosas and water coming!  Everyone order different things ... no 2 people ordered the same thing.  I can't remember everything everyone had but I know there were plenty of mixed reviews.  Some said everything was room temperature, some said cold, some said bland, some said \"just taste a chicken Caesar salad I'd make myself\".  I ordered the white hash dish with a side of scrambled eggs.  The eggs were cold and looked like they may have sat there for a while.  I sent them back and asked for a side of fruit instead.  Chelsea had no problem with that!   We all agreed that we'd like to give them another shot in a few months because we had such a good time and the mimosa were great and truly unlimited :)"}
{"text":"We stopped by here on a Sunday for brunch and had a great time!  The food was delicious, the staff was exceptionally friendly and attentive, and I really enjoyed the live music.  Two big thumbs up!  I hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"We came here for New Year's Day brunch for my mother-in-law's bday. They were one of the few places that offered brunch on NYD so that was nice but no bottomless mimosas :-/ only on Sat & Sun.  Really cute location right in the park with other nice restaurants around.  Food was good, nothing outstanding, just the basic brunch.  We each had 2 mimosas which was the majority of the bill but overall it was a good brunch for not a bad price."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere in the cultural center part of Scottsdale.  There was a guy singing and playing guitar.  Food was good.  I had the Greek omelette. I would recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast in old town. My boyfriend and I live in old town and this our go to breakfast spot. The food is amazing and the service is always great. All their omelettes are amazing and so are the hashes. The green flannel is my favorite hash. It's perfect and it's an actual hash not just clumps of meat clumps of potatoes. I can't recommend this place enough if you love breakfast. They're also dog friendly too which is awesome."}
{"text":"Good food and selections Good service  Hospitable and friendly Like the remodel Good music today Nice patio Been to that orange table location for a decade or more Similar menu Could do without the sports screens Do not fit and take away from atmosphere"}
{"text":"Our server, Erin, was a 4star rating but the food needs work. Once we ordered it took a very long time to get our food when other tables of 3 & 4 who arrived & ordered after us got their food before us-not good. Then to top it off our eggs were raw, runny is one thing but the whites were raw and the yolk on one of my eggs was also partially raw. We tried to get the attention of the manager (tall guy there) but he never came over to our table unless it was to check on the group of guys next to us. I loved it when it was The Orange Table, they may have the same menu but the quality has yet to be desired. I will give it one more chance, thanks to our server Erin, hopefully she will still be there."}
{"text":"Great outside patio to enjoy a bite before a show at Scottsdale Center for the Arts.  My sandwich was delicious as was my cocktail."}
{"text":"I miss orange table. We were seated right away, actively avoided for 15 minutes, brought water and were told we would have to wait another 5 minutes for the waitress (as there was only one working during the Saturday brunch rush...). We waited another 15 minutes while debating leaving before the waitress showed up and took our order. ONE HOUR LATER the awful food was delivered to the table. Two underwhelming caprese salads with old tomatoes and a well done burger (ordered as medium) later, we left. I would not recommend this place to anyone.   One good thing was the live music. Otherwise, big waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Great food, love the hashes and the couple next to me had a breakfast sandwiches that looked fantastic.  Started with a bloody mary which was very good and ended with a greyhound with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice which was great.  Owner came around to make sure everyone was happy, nice place and great service."}
{"text":"Ryan was very friendly great drinks and awesome food. Amazing service too. I would recommend this place to anyone.  Oh ya live music too"}
{"text":"I've held 2 company events with Park Place Bar & Grill now. One was for a client appreciation event and the other for our company holiday party. For both events, we were going to a post-show afterward at the Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts after Park Place, so their location is IDEAL for anyone attending an event at Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts or in the nearby surrounding area. You just can't beat it. It's directly across from the venue and you don't even have to cross the street and just a minute's walk across the to the center.    The owners, Lori and Paul (Paul also Old Town Tavern) are remarkable. They're down to earth and such an ease to work with. The pricing was so feasible compared to some of the other nearby restaurants that I had also called to host our events. They helped me with the party planning process and are flexible with providing alternative items other than certain fixed menu items, if you want.   The food is top notch too. The clients and co-workers raved about the onion rings saying they were the best they've ever had. My favorites are the beer-battered onion rings, baked brie, salmon cakes, rib tips and steak & blue burgers.    Park Place Bar & Grill's cocktail list is well done too. Some great bourbon combinations mixed to perfection. My to-die-for drink of theirs is called \"After Eight\" (Southern Comfort, Peppermint Schnapps, Bailey's Irish Crème, Frangelico. Topped off with chocolate mint gelato). YUMMM. It's pretty much everything a girl could ask for!   The whole staff is incredibly friendly and was well prepped for our events and the logistics. The owner, Lori, stayed in touch with me all the way up to our event and the day of to discuss options due some unexpected drizzling rain. Ryan was the bartender for our company holiday party event and he was on point the entire evening. They anticipate your needs, offered to help with last minute decoration prep as they were prepping food and settings. Definitely check them out and you're sure to become a regular after just one visit."}
{"text":"Little hard to find the first time around but the food is excellent. Burgers are cooked perfectly, great stuffed french toast for a lite desert. The bite of egg samdwhich was also great, perfect classic breakfast, definitly get it on the bagle!"}
{"text":"I have had the worst experience with both the park place and grub hub today!! First my order was over 1 hour late and when he showed up forgot my coffee, so he ran out to go back and get it from the location and when I looked at my order it was wrong, I called park place and told the man on the phone my issue he said no problem we will re make your food and the coffee should be on the way since the man from grub hub just came and picked it up. Then I receive my coffee 30 mins later that I had to warm up!!! Then over a hour goes by and no sign of food so I call and speak with the bartender at park place and said he talked with the cook and the cook said the order was fine!! So your telling me you don't even call back and I'm not getting the order that you said you would remake for me?! The bartender said I cannot help you and to contact grub hub!! This is the worst customer service I have ever seen!! Being in a industry that customer service impacts the most I know when company's are not going above and beyond and in no way did I feel valued!!!!!! I am a paying customer and the level of professionalism in this situation is very disappointing. So unexceptionable!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was good! Coming back w friends for sure and some good food and bottomless mimosas!"}
{"text":"The food here has always been very good. . Came two times for brunch.... on the 2nd occasion we arrived closed to closing time at 3pm why h we were unaware of, and they were out of many items... but our orders were delicious and our waiter was pleasant"}
{"text":"The location is nice and sitting outside with my boyfriend and dog was a treat, and one of the main reasons we decided to try it out was the dog friendly patio.  Unfortunately our waiter was busier talking to others and flirting at different tables then checking in on us, he didn't write our order down which many waiters/waitresses do, but the technique doesn't work for him because my order was wrong, I had mustard on my sandwich which I specifically asked to not include, my boyfriend asked for i in rings and got french fries instead, didn't check on us when food came out so that he could correct the issues, and our drinks never got filled. Service was just ridiculously poor and not what I expected according to really good reviews.   Plus side, the music was good, but that won't intrigue someone to continue to come"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, I'm well aware when you hit a rush I do understand that the kitchen gets backed up. No big deal, but as a server it's your job to keep your tables informed. We sat for 45 minutes after ordering our food.. We finally asked what was going on we were informed it would be another 10/15 minutes. After 20 more minutes server came back to tell us it would be another 20/30.. Not only were we expected to wait an hour and 30 minutes for BREAKFAST food but we had to get up and get our own drinks from another server. There were 2 tables with 8 people that already had food and were finished by the time we asked the first time what was going on. And another 4 tables with 3-4 people waiting for food. Needless to say we will not be back."}
{"text":"Three and a half stars.  Same menu from Orange Table days (I'd say about 90% quality of execution) with better service on my one visit.  However, although the remodel is impressive, they've changed the decor to \"sports bar chic\" and it took all of the warmth out of the place.  I'm sure my breakfast buddy and I will still eat here, but I'm also sure we'll stick to the patio.  The vibe is definitely different, and we're not really fancy sports bar people."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast with my daughter. She had corn beef hash and eggs and I had stuffed French toast and lattes.  Very pleasant wait staff, food was tasty. I would come here again. Next time maybe mimosas"}
{"text":"I would have given more stars except for the comment I received by the proprietor. I ate there with 3 friends. I had a cup of warm (not hot) soup and 1/2 a sandwich and my bill was $14. I earned rewards and was asked to review the place. I was honest and stated 'the food was overpriced for what you got'. This is what I received from the proprietor:  I apologize that you feel our prices were high for what you received. I wish you the best in finding a place that suites you expectations and price. We have rave reviews on our food and most people leave with a box with the left overs. You may be better off having breakfast or lunch at Denny's. The prices may be in line with you wallet. Paul S. Mitchell Proprietor  I don't think he should've been that rude and unprofessional! Now all 4 of us aren't going there anymore. Don't patronize this jerk's establishment!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Groupon we just found this hidden little gem...Excellent food, amazing service (Marissa was a delight) and dog friendly!  We ordered the \"Loki\" (delicious homemade Corned Beef!) & the Ahi Tuna sandwich (big piece of Tuna, nice and pink in the middle, YUM!).  ALSO you can't go wrong w/ the bottomless Mimosa/Bloody Marys (garnished w/ crisp piece bacon, among others!!!).  SO HAPPY!  Will def be back to try the \"adult smoothies\"!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The hash and eggs was amazing and my friends pancakes and eggs were absolutely yummy! Plus the food came out so quickly. Fresh squeezed bottomless mimosas and bottomless loaded Bloody Mary's complete with bacon. The best thing about this place was the wonderful manager, Matthew! He made my friend's birthday celebration so special with his warmth and his charm!  If you want a yummy, casual breakfast this is the place. We will definitely be back to this gem again! My new fave breakfast place in South Scottsdale. (Right next to SMOCA in the civic center)"}
{"text":"Hands down favorite place for breakfast/brunch. Great live music (not the kind when you can't hear the person across from you)..awesome food and the staff is so welcoming! I love park place!"}
{"text":"I am surprised this place had such high reviews. We went for late food eats, maybe breakfast is better.  Our group got two salads, a sandwich and a burger. While we all liked our food, none of the food really stood out to any of us."}
{"text":"Great alternative from RnR for bottomless mimosas  and bloody Mary's on Sunday's. Food is a bit over priced but what do you expect from Scottsdale. Much more low key and sometimes a dude with high white socks plays Eric Clapton tunes. Mos def would come back!"}
{"text":"Very rude to have a band playing same time as Sunday Affair, will not be eating here unless they change this"}
{"text":"As many of the other reviewers stated, this place is only OK in terms of brunch vibe. If you're looking for bottomless mimosas and walking through old town after, this is the place for you! But if you are looking to continue the neighborhood warmth and hole in the wall feel that orange table gave us all, keep on looking. I used to love walking through civic center with our dog for a brunch in this spot but the vibe is just not what I want out of a brunch place, music was weird, there was smoking on the patio and while the menu is the same as orange table, it wasn't really executed 100%. I got the \"park place benedict\" and I didn't lick the plate clean like I used to for that item, so i've got to try something different next time.  I may give them another shot and maybe we just went too early into their opening time, they've got a few kinks to work out still. Like I said, just a new vibe then we're used to for this spot in civic center, but I can appreciate what they are trying to do! I do think having a place to go at night in civic center will be nice so I look forward to trying happy hour."}
{"text":"Park Place is a bit hard to find, but once you find it, you'll be glad you did.  The menu isn't huge but there are enough options for everyone.  Had I been in the mood for breakfast, they seemed to offer some pretty good selections.  Instead, the hubby and I both decided to try their veggie sandwich.  Unfortunately, they kind of missed the mark with this one.  The veggies were fresh, but the sandwich was pretty dry.  It could have used some type of spread. The included fries were pretty good though and the Bloody Mary was delicious.  We sat outside on a Saturday morning and the atmosphere was incredibly relaxing.  Even the dogs that they allow on the patio seemed to fit right in.  If you bring your dog, they will bring him a bowl of water around the same time they bring your water.  The musician they had on the patio also added to the nice ambiance.  Definitely a great place to go for brunch!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Id never had hash before and it was recommended and I'm addicted. Whether super busy or slow or breakfast or lunch the staff is by and far the friendliest in the valley. Location is great, live music is usually spot on, and it's local and close enough I can ride my bike."}
{"text":"Early to a class at SMOCA so I stopped in for a bite. Service was very attentive and quick. Excellent wine list. I had the baked Brie plate which was beautiful presented. Toasted bread and a feast of perfectly ripe fruit. Baby grapes still on the stem, slices strawberries, raspberries and blueberries. The brie was baked in file dough and the best Brie I've had. Nice outdoor patio. I'll be going back"}
{"text":"Nice environment and the food for the price is well worth it and I'm not a big eggs Benedict but the chorizo one is amazing and the omelettes are just so great and helps the mamosas are unlimited. But overall was wonderful experience and the musician is really good."}
{"text":"The breakfast hash is tasty...egg sandwich solid...all in all worth it...good service...nice people..."}
{"text":"Stopped here for coffee and a quick breakfast while visiting a friend on a layover in Phoenix. My friend told me it used to be called something with orange in the title and she hoped that this place would still be as good as she remembered it. Upon recommendation from our server, we both ordered Mexican lattes, mine hot, hers iced. Both were delicious. I had a breakfast sandwich earlier in the morning right when my flight got in so we decided to split an order of their buttermilk pancakes with bacon. Pancakes were a perfect fluffiness and bacon just the right amount of crispiness. Was plenty of food for two people to share. If I lived in Phoenix I would be here regularly. The owner came out to greet us and talked to us about the changes and improvements that were made since my friend was familiar with the previous place. Our server was attentive and friendly without being creepy, attributes I always value in good service. Be sure to check this place out! Also they give a 10% military discount."}
{"text":"I miss Orange Table! The menu at Park Place had changed since I ate there about a year ago. They used to have a great selection of their pancakes and now they only have 1-2 very basic options. Ended up getting the french toast which was really burnt and not very tasty. No one in my group was very happy with their meal. I could make a better breakfast at home honestly. Used to love this place, but sadly do not plan on returning. You're better off heading over to AZ88 for some brunch."}
{"text":"We stopped by here wanting to try out a new place for brunch. It was a little tricky to find but we were surprised once we got there that we had been there previously when it was a different restaurant. We picked a table on the patio since it was a nice day. They had umbrellas randomly scattered about but few tables were actually shaded by them. Not a problem for me since I was looking to feel a little sunshine but I could see it as a challenge in the summer. We were served quickly and the food was pretty good. I love that they have those cute little jam/preserve jars for your toast! We paid the bill when it was dropped which might have been a mistake. It was pretty tough to get service after that. Perhaps we should have waited until we were ready to leave to pay it but I'd hoped they would continue to check on us since we got the bottomless mimosa option and had coffees.  Overall, I would come here again if I was in the area and didn't want to try something new but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back since it's a bit of a drive for me."}
{"text":"Great food... Reasonably priced and great atmosphere. Used to be the old Orange Table...Paul & Lori have done a great job in calibration to transform this establishment into a great place to eat & drink...check it out!"}
{"text":"We had a nice time here. The live music for breakfast was great. Our food was good and the servers were friendly. The eggs were cooked nicely and the French toast was great. The grilled cheese with bacon and avocados was excellent and the sour dough bread was fresh and delicious. My only complaint is that they don't have a kids menu. The patio is perfect for small children and they should offer parents an option so we don't have to order full size meals for the little ones."}
{"text":"Disappointed to find out this was not Orange Table anymore. Elated to leave with the same euphoria after scarfing down OUTRAGEOUSLY delicious food from a very similar menu. Awesome pancakes, phenomenal flannels, outrageous bacon, stupendous pico. Mmmmmm. Come here!.....a hidden gem."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a brunch place on Easter. We live in Scottsdale and anywhere were go we usually have to wait at least 30 minutes. We found this spot in the park and decided to check it out. We got seated right away and had our choice of inside or patio. The staff was so nice they kept adjusting the umbrellas to make sure we had enough shade.   We got the unlimited mimosas/Bloody Mary deal which was well worth it. I ordered the the red flannel and my wife got the green. Both were amazing. Portions were great and the food was the best quality. It sounds weird to brag about eggs but usually I ask for over medium and they are either too runny or well done, these were the best eggs I've had while eating out.   They have an extensive menu for breakfast and lunch and a good drink selection. We will be back to try lunch and again for breakfast."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and each experience makes me like it less.  The food is so-so, it's understaffed, too loud when there's music, and, best of all, they changed my tip.  Save your money, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Get a new chef. All our food came out burnt. Waitress was good but she needs to stop putting the bill presenter in between her pants and butt crack. Freaking gross!"}
{"text":"This place is very disappointing, had to wait over an hour for a mediocre breakfast sandwich that was cold"}
{"text":"Petty good food,  just a little pricy.  Its filling and they use great ingredients and the presentation is very nice as well. Its pretty casual."}
{"text":"Since R & R was busy, we decided to head over to Park Place for their bottomless mimosas and bloody marys! This restaurant is located behind the parking structure, and the Yelp map was a little misleading so we were extremely lost when we first walked over. After calling, we finally made our way in, and got seated immediately!  Service was a little on the slow side because it was really busy for two servers, but the server was extremely nice and friendly. We got the bottomless mimosa option at $20 a person, and ordered various versions of corned beef hash and the Park Place Eggs Benedict.  The eggs benedict had chorizo and avocado, and it was a great combination! The eggs were poached perfectly, and the hollandaise sauce was nice and creamy. A great dish overall, but a little heavy for me as I could not finish (or maybe it was the mimosas?). My friends' various versions of corned beef hash were all delicious. The hash was seasoned well and texture was great. The corned beef hash also comes with two eggs any style.   There was also a live band playing which made for a really nice sunday brunch, and we had a great time here!"}
{"text":"I was stoked to walk in. But after 20 minutes of being ignored other than water from a barback... Place was crap. People were rude. No service. No friendly hello. I won't return. Poor poor service."}
{"text":"Had a ball!!! This place is quiet but has great brunch and awesome bottomless mimosas. And as a plus the staff will have you laughing. Try the berry pancakes!"}
