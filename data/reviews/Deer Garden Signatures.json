{"text":"Fish soup not recommend, just no good! Other fish soup restaurant on hwy 7 better than here! Some vegetable in soup seem being expire, taste seem sour! Tea time rice combo jut nothing special but my teenage girl told me that it's bad! Chicken wings also not recommend too!! I only recommend the source they give for the noodle ( I think is xo source, but my husband said that mind one at home most better) Service ok, a lady very friendly to show the menu and told us about the tea time special! But I just feel little bit too much!!  Food come within 10 mins after ordered ( but that day only 3 tables in store) We try 1 more time but would be 3 more months later !"}
{"text":"The name for this restaurant has changed.  It's now known as Deer Garden Signatures.   Which is the same one located at Time Square.    Advertisement was showing $8.75 per bowl, well it came out to be closer to $15 per bowl.  The advertised price was just the basic, where you select soup base,  2 meat/veggies and choice of noodles.   Each additional add on was about $1.50 each.  Bowl of noodles came with a basic drink as well.  If you wanted to upgrade, cost will range from $1 - $2.  There was also side dishes to order as well for about $1.95 each.  We ordered the Maggie sauce pork chop and chicken wings.   Both dishes were pretty good but small.   Lol  I upgraded to the house special green milk tea.  They offered free tapioca for me.   They also provide free chilly oil sauce that evening.  Which was pretty good as well.   For the actual noodles and soup, I ordered thick rice noodles with tom yum soup base.   Not a big fan of tomatoes in soup but surprisingly it was not that bad. Ordered beef brisket, fish slices and choy sum.  I would say the portions were pretty decent too.  All in all not that bad.  Strong fish smell in restaurant but that was expected.   Will I come back... to be honest, food was not that bad but I would rather do pho with spring rolls :)"}
{"text":"- A quite popular Fish Soup Noodle place around the area - I like the Tom Yum Noodle Soup and the Ice Chocolate - Always long wait - Taste - not bad, steady - Price - getting more expensive - Service - most of the servers are nice, except those experience ones"}
{"text":"No wait time Fast service   Malay Laksa Soup with large noodle, sliced beef brisket and luncheon meat. The bowl came extremely hot - which was good. The portion was great and it had enough meat to satisfy my cravings. The sliced beef brisket was sized well and an adequate amount of beef was given. The spicy curry and coconut milk mixture was balanced quiet well. If you can take some heat, I would definitely recommend this Soup base!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for a big bowl of yummy noodles! This place is still super popular and busy even though it's been open for a while now. They have also increased their price for the bowl of soup noodles to $9.95 which includes your choice of soup base, type of noodle, 2 toppings, and a hot drink. I hope they don't keep jacking up the price though!  My favorite soup bases are the fish broth and malay laksa. Coming from a part Malaysian family, the laksa soup is not authentic but it's expected since most restaurants just add loads of coconut milk. Still tastes pretty good though and has the perfect spiciness level. Always get my order with vermicelli noodles and like to change up my toppings as they have lots of options! They also have a lot of drink options, from bubble teas to special mixed drinks.   I've never had an issue with customer service here. My orders have always been correct and served really quickly. I'd say it's worth it for the price you pay as the portion is really big and always tastes good!"}
{"text":"Deer Garden is always busy during peak dinner time and it was no exception when we arrived for dinner on a Saturday evening. There was a large crowd of people around the door but since the restaurant is fairly large, we were seated within 10 minutes.   The menu is pretty comprehensive, with a good selection of soup bases and some rice dishes as well. Every entree comes with a hot drink - cold drinks and fancier drinks are extra charge.   This time we ordered:  - Malay laksa soup: With thick rice noodles, fish balls and fish tofu. The soup base is really flavourful - spicy, creamy and packed with coconut flavour.  - Peanut sauce and chili soup: With egg noodle, sliced beef brisket and fish puffs. This one is definitely my favourite soup base. I love the mixture of peanut and chili - they complement each other perfectly in this soup and doesn't overpower each other.  - Pan seared ox tongue (side order): It melts in your mouth! But it's too salty.   In a previous visit, I ordered one of the fish soup base, and it had absolutely zero flavour. No amount of chili oil or soy sauce could have saved it (both of which you have to ask for).   I never have high expectations for service in Chinese restaurants, but the service here was below average - the waitresses just aren't friendly. They also gave us our drinks way too late - we already finished eating by the time they set down ONE of our two drinks (and we both ordered hot milk teas) - we actually had to chase them down for the second one.   Overall, you come here for the food and not the experience, but I can only recommend the malay laksa and peanut sauce & chili soups."}
{"text":"They sat me and my pregnant wife at a tiny table for two and refused to seat us at a larger table even though they had plenty of them. We started to leave and then they back peddled and sat us at a larger table. Then when another group came in she made it a point to tell them they had to wait because \"our larger tables are taken because even parties of two are sitting in them.\" Real classy. It was Monday, not busy, and there were other empty tables.  This place has steadily raised prices and lowered quality. You're better off going to the newer places with the same build your own soup model. Chef Papa at Peachtree and Langham near Unionville T&T deserve your business much more than this place."}
{"text":"Visited on a Friday night at 7pm. Parking is a mayhem in this plaza. Park far so you can walk it off after you eat! Didn't need to wait and got a table for 3 people right by the door.   They're known for creating your noodle soup combo ($9.50). It includes choice of soup, 2 toppings and a drink.  You mark down on a piece of paper at your table what kind of soup, noodles, 2 toppings and drink you want. On the paper, it notes which broth has no MSG and which broths do have it. I find it honest of them to notify their customers which broths have MSG, but who actually knows if there is MSG in it? Most fish base soups had no MSG. However, I am not a big fan of fish so I did not choose a fish base soup. Comes with 2 toppings and after 2 are $1.50 extra. Choose a drink - cold HK drinks are $1 extra and specialty drinks have an extra cost depending on what drink you order.   I ordered a chicken broth soup with thin rice noodles, beef brisket and beef tendon, and a cold lemon tea for these hot and humid days in Toronto. Soup broth was a little salty because of the MSG. Some portions of the beef brisket was soft, but the tendon was even softer which was good for my liking. My bf ordered the gingko and pepper fish soup with thin rice noodles, beef tongue, pork liver and beef tendon. It was too pepper-y for his liking and would avoid choosing it as the soup base. My bf's mom ordered the spare ribs in black bean sauce on rice. At first the two noodle soups arrived fast (probably within 5 mins of taking the order), and the spare rib dish did not arrive until we had to ask the waitresses where it was after 15 mins of waiting (minus a star). Usually when you serve food, you are supposed to serve every person's meal all at once.. Typically does not happen at Asian restaurants. Pretty sure they forgot the dish because it came out in a flash.  I felt pretty bloated after I finished my meal and it was probably the MSG and the excessive amount of noodles.   Service was meh until it was disappointing at the end when there was a lot of people waiting for a table at 8pm. One of the waitresses saw we were finished eating and immediately dropped our bill on the table so she forced us leave and seat a new party. Uh ok? Trying to have a conversation here and you're making us leave? Please do not rush people out of your restaurant when they are trying to enjoy their dining experience. No bueno.  It was a ok deal for $11 meal, average and nothing too special. Cash or debit only."}
{"text":"This place is a must-go-to if you like rice noodles. Very fresh broth with veggies, up to two kinds of meat and one drink for less than $10. Portion size is big enough for my starving stomach. Side orders are also cheap."}
{"text":"One of my favorite soup noodle places in Toronto. The szechuan soup base with spam and pumpkin is what I always get. I really enjoy the milk tea that comes with the meal - it has a strong tea flavour. Pricing is also great. The service is quite fast but there is often a line up during rush hours.   If you're looking for a place to catch up with a friend this might not be the place because they like to hurry you out of the restaurant as soon as you finish eating. Good news is that Destiny's is in the same plaza!"}
{"text":"After two years I figured I'll give this place a try again, came on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. The broth has improved from two years ago, it is no longer as diluted. However, service seem to have gotten worse. The waitress placed the bill on our table half way through our meal to rush us out, my sister wasn't even half done her bowl of noodles yet. How rude. I also found a bug in my bowl near the end :( they don't wash their veggies thoroughly enough."}
{"text":"Great find on highway 7 especially for Fish soup restaurant.  The food is fresh . I love the fact that they identify all food without MSG with # so you have a choice . Their soup base is very good and their service more than satisfactory.  Also a little secret: their pepper sauce is actually XO sauce, an expensive chili sauce cooked with shrimps and spice.   Watch out for the long line up...it is long   But so worth it!"}
{"text":"Got there at 11am, being the 2nd customer and by the time we left at 12.3pm, the place was almost full.  Is it the \"best\" noodle I had?  Tastiest?  Best value?   Probably not.     What makes this place so successful though is probably the Combo option where for one price $9.xx, you can \"customize\" your noodle soup with choice of: - broth (fish soup is most popular),  - noodle, &  -2 types toppings - being meat based or veggies/vegetarian.   -includes a free (hot) drink.   **Cold drinks and anything outside of the basic general combo menu are for additional $$.  Also, it came with lots of nappa (Chinese cabbage) veggies.  together with the popular fish soup and veggies, no msg...it comes across as being \"healthy\".    For all that, it makes it worth it to revisit."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's always packed which is a good sign. Sometimes the service can be slower but the soups are totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere & service: decor was modern and clean. Service was rushed and somewhat rude. Business model is clearly designed to get u in and out asap.   Order: we ordered the original fish soup with flat rice noodles. Topped with pork and beef balls. Also got a parsley/century egg soup with vermicelli topped with fish balls and veggies. For side orders we got Honey glazed red sausages and fried chicken wings. Drinks were milk tea and Ovaltine.  Food rating: noodle soup base, both were very bland   surprisingly. Especially against the toppings. Full disclosure though, both bases didn't come with msg. So maybe the others would be more flavorful. Three toppings were as expected. Same as if u bought from the store and cooked it yourself. The didn't have any brisket left which was disappointing. The drinks tasted watered down as well.  Overall: will not be making a return. The combos were expensive for what we got $8.95 not including the side orders"}
{"text":"We have been this place for a couple of times. Every time we can't fall asleep after eating dinner at this restaurant, both me and my husband. There must be something in food that kept us excited and awake."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat in the Richmond Hill area! We headed there to grab dinner here at around 9pm and even at that time there was about a 20 min wait. Table turnover rates are high, but we had a party of 5 so it took a bit longer to wait for the bigger table.   We all went for the signature $8.75 build you own noodle combo and it comes with a Chinese milk tea. You get to choose your broth, 2 toppings (it's $1.50 each for additional toppings) and type of noodle.  If you want cold it's additional $1.75 and for their signature milk tea it's another $1. There are also side specials that you can order for $1.95, but it is only limited to two per noodle order. I personally really enjoyed it, the portions for both toppings and noodle were generous and flavourful. The milk tea was also quite smooth and not too sweet.   There are also rice dishes to choose from ($8-12) and bubble tea for those who want something to go ($4-6). I would highly recommend it to anyone in the area looking for relatively low cost Chinese food."}
{"text":"Happy to have this gem in the neighbourhood. They have a set menu as well as pick your own combos. Choose your broth, noodles, meats and vegetables. Combos come with milk tea and other Hong Kong style beverages. Large portions of soup with lots of ingredients. They are not stingy on the meat! Great option if you're craving a hearty soup. Imagine this will become a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"Interesting customizable ingredients concept.  I had the ginkgo/mushroom based broth with thick vermicelli and fried chicken wings side dish.  And cold house special milk tea for drink.   However, I kept hankering for a good bowl of ramen from Kenzo,  for example.  I didn't think it was devastatingly good. Maybe it was the fish based broth, which I am not used to, or the mild taste."}
{"text":"Horrible. Food is great but does not compensate for the incompetent and unfriendly service. Got multiple items wrong on our order yet still gave us attitude like we made a mistake.  Will not recommend or return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"for a quick and moderate priced meal, deer garden is an option. they try to get you in and out quickly and the servers at this location are terribly unhappy which is annoying, especially if you happen to go at a time where there is no parking and a line for a table.  the food itself is decent and always hot. i tend to stick with one their special items which is the beef brisket, ox tongue and beef tendon spicy korean ramyun noodles. for a buck cheaper i get 1 more topping but no options to choose (though i believe you can change the noodles). i've had this a couple times now and it has maintained its quality.   the laksa soup base is okay as well but it is missing that punch of tangy spice.   I find the drinks to be on the sweet side.  from my experience this restaurant has fresher ingredients than the one in Markham/Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"What was supposed to be a late night snack with the husband turned out into a full meal. I should have known since the noodle soup here is sooo good. He was craving chicken wings but I was looking for something a bit healthier. This place was a great choice since their fish soup doesn't have MSG. Got the fish base with fish tofu, choy sum and korean style sweet potato crystal noodle (japchae noodles yum!). They were out of choy sum so got bok choy instead and added chicken wings for $2.75. We didn't have to wait long at all but that's probably bc we came at 9pm. Portion size is great and the fish tofu is my favourite. We've had both the hot milk tea and cold which are good as well. Will be trying the Malay Laksa soup base the next time we're here."}
{"text":"First off: food is good, service is not that great.  I'd give the food a 4/5 but the service a 2/5 so I'm averaging it to a 3/5.  I ordered the \"Dan dan\" soup with egg noodles, fish ball, fish fillet and king mushroom. I was disappointed with the mushroom portion because you get two options of topping with your meal and any extra is 1.50. I only got maybe 4 pieces which made up all of 1 mushroom. If I'm going to pay 1.50, I expect more than 1 mushroom. Otherwise, the flavor of the broth was delicious and I enjoyed my meal. My mom got the original soup with Korean sweet potato noodles and some pork. I am definitely going to try those noodles next time.  My mom has been here several times and it's become one of her regular spots so food is good here.  The service: generally you don't get great service from a lot of the Chinese restaurants that are of a cafe style and this is no exception. What bothered me though was that they had given us the bill before we were done eating! I hate when restaurants do that! It's so rude! I inderstand that it was busy but really?   I'd  come here for the food again but I'm going to hope they rushing people out isn't a common practice."}
{"text":"Last time I was here.. its was a Fish Soup place.. there are still hundreds of fish hanging from the ceiling.    We got a nice big booth and it took a long time to read through the menus... way too many choices and decisions.   I really like the cold drinks you can upgrade your meal to."}
{"text":"Went there 3 times, each time was very packed so i assumed this place is decent.  Each time i went i even tried different soup bases and noodles, neither times ive went was a good experience. After eating at this place i get a very unpleasant gag reflex, it makes me want to puke. Surprisingly one of my friends did vomit right after eating the spicy soup base with korean glass noodle. It was absolutely  disgusting, i don't know what they put in their noodles and i will never come back or recommend anyone to eat here."}
{"text":"Cost: reasonable Quality: good - 80% Decor: average - 75% Staff: average service - 70% Value: good - 80%  Keeper? Yes will go there for noodle soup!!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today and was surprised that my group found a table relatively quickly (it's usually really packed during lunch on weekdays).  I ordered their daily special combo, which comes with a customizable soup with a drink. I definitely like how I can choose the type of soup and the accompaniments, my favourite is the Preserved egg with parsley soup rice with beef and fish balls. A friend of mine ordered the peanut sauce and chili soup and it tasted really good - I'll need to try that next time!  One strange part that I found was that their Passion fruit black tea looks extremely dark - as if it's a chocolate drink or milk tea. But rest assured, it is Passion fruit!  Tip for splitting the bill with a big group: assign each person a letter and put it on your order sheet.  Looking forward to my next lunch trip here!"}
{"text":"Food was large portion.  Prices were reasonable if you dont add on extra items.  Since we added 3 items to our noodles each our bill was $50 for two adults. We also order one side dish as well for $10.  Overall I would come back because the taste was fairy good.  I ordered the thick noodle with chicken broth and my husband got the thick noodle with tom yum broth"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this restaurant as I love pho and with make it yourself, what's not to love?  Pros Choose your own soup base, noodles, toppings Easy set meals that come with a free drink Diversity in drink menu- important as I am caffeine free Easy to order, no language barrier as you just mark down in a box on paper what you want Fish base soup has no msg Tom yum soup although spicey is not too spicey Service is good Place is busy. Opened 11am on Sunday, we got there at 11:30 and it was getting busy- by 12:30 there was a line at the door!  Cons Cash or debit only, no credit Food was mediocre, I had the beef tripe, beef brisket, egg noodle, and Tom yum soup base. Could be what I ordered but I am looking forward to ordering a different base next time.  I will be coming again to update my review."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from another restaurant owner. Although the concept is neat to be able to create your own noodle bowls, the quality of the food was disappointing, as well as the service.   It seems common in this culture that the desserts come with your main food, and I'm not sure how that is acceptable to anybody. The staff doesn't seem to happy, and really are not that welcoming.   I ordered the chicken broth with sliced beef and enoki mushrooms, with rice noodle and was disappointed with the quality of the beef (it was hard to chew, and very little beef if that). The bill per person was $18, and we only started with a $8.25 bowl and just kept adding.   I also ordered the chicken wings and the beef tongue, both of which came out on a plate that came from a school cafeteria, and made no attempts to make it presentable.   On the bright side, they have people lining up outside for this and is cash only so they must be doing well somehow."}
{"text":"The fish soup is very good. It's light and creamy, and no MSG. At first it seems pricey at $8.25/bowl, but it's a big bowl of noodles. Ordered the beef tongue and fired chicken wings as sides. Nothing special, so will pass on that next time.   The pepper oil is really good. Try it with the toppings. The drinks are ok but there are better milk tea out there.   It's a big place but go early if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"The food and table service are both acceptable for the price, but it really bothered me that when I wanted to take my set lunch out, using my own containers, which I always carry in my car to be eco-friendly, the store manager insisted that I pay extra for the included drink EVEN USING MY OWN CONTAINER. I understand charging extra for take-out when using your containers. What kind of social responsibility is this? I understand charging extra for take-out when using your containers. Anyway, the store manager's could-not-care-less/take it or leave it attitude really turned me off. Bad, very bad!"}
{"text":"It is always so busy.  The menu is choose and pick for your noodle and toppings.  You can first choose your noodle, then decide whether to have greens or not.  Add 2 toppings for the normal price or add additional for extra. Most important is to choose your soup base. Plus your drink now you will have a tasty and full meal.   The hot drink is in a stainless steel vacuum mug and looks interesting.   Each part of the noodle soup can have many choices, so as if you are preparing your own noodle in your kitchen !  For different ingredients and prices, please see other yelpers !"}
{"text":"Their fish noodle soup really good. Depends  on what kind of soup you choose. The soup base still the fish soup.  i really like the addon chicken wings."}
{"text":"Lemme tell you something real quick about  this spot. No word of a lie, first of all, it's crazy hype because it came from some other place. But truth be told it's not that sick. I'd give it a solid 8/10 but its definitely something you'd randomly crave in the midst of Netflix N Chill.  Food and Drink combo is getting a bit overpriced, like real talk. This restaurant is in Markham, you tryna tell me that a bowl of noodle soup should be over $10? SMDH. I still eat with this restaurant styll.  Stuff to get: - Peanut Spicy Soup - Extra Hot Sauce - Cold Green Milk Tea"}
{"text":"Great place for fast and consistent quality food.  Their customize yourself noodle option is a plus in my opinion with lots of options for noodle type, soup broth, sides. It's a great combo that comes with a drink.   Food: Quality is good for the price and service you get. I like their original fish broth, not salty and homey taste. A lot of variety of meats and vegetables to choose from, I had the beef brisket and choy sum. Good portions and taste great.  Atmosphere: Fast service. Ordered and within 10mins, order was ready steaming hot."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. Food and service is consistent. There's good selection and when you feel like hot noodles on a cold day, it's a good choice.   Food: I like the ordering sheet so that I can customize everything I want. I'm pretty picky about no green onion and with that order sheet, it's very convenient. The combo is great, noodles and a drink with the option to add appetizers if you wish. Great selection of broth and toppings that taste good.   Service: Comfortable seating but service is a bit lacking. It's pretty much you order and hand in the sheet and eat (no tea refill unless you ask for it)."}
{"text":"Great noodles! The spicy peanut is delicious! Lots of toppings, but they recently increased the price which is unfortunate! Still very tasty and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"My favourite soup noodle place in Toronto. Generous portion and reasonable price. While most restaurants serve a stingy portion of toppings for a bowl of soup noodle, at Deer Garden, not only they serve you a generous portion of noodle but the toppings too! That's the reason why I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The fish soup is very flavourful and does not taste like msg. It is not overly salty either so you do not leave feeling super thirsty.  This is a really good value place, for about $10, you will get a filling meal and a drink. I will recommend spending a few dollars more and get a side dish as they are really tasty!   This place is pretty busy so be prepared to wait awhile if going during peak hours. Service can be disappointing as they are understaffed and have a lot of tables to wait."}
{"text":"Come here often since my fiancé is a huge fan of noodle soup and just realized on my 10th check-in that I haven't wrote a review so here goes. Meal selection is unique because you get to customize your bowl. Ex. You select the type of noodle, toppings, and side items. I'm a big fan of the peanut chili soup with instant noodles and a side order of chicken wings. Honey glazed sausages are recommended too. Service is typically quick but place gets busy at prime meal hours so be patient or stay clear for you might turn into the hulk. Overall, it's worth the visit and I recommend the joint"}
{"text":"This place was really good. They are clean and fresh.  We tried their laksa and their peanut chilli broth. They have a paper sheet where You get to customize your soup. From the base to the type of noodle.  The peanut was really creamy and laksa was exactly how it's supposed to be!  I will def come back here"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, I love the tomato fish soup especially the fact that it has no msg. Service improved a bit since the beginning but it's still not great. Be sure to ask them for their hot chilli oil - the main reason I go, it's amazing. I go quite often and would recommend for a casual day."}
{"text":"Food: 8.5/10 Atmosphere: 7/10  Service: 7/10 Overall experience: 8/10  If you're craving some hot noodles on a cold winter night, this is your place. You are able to customize the dish exactly to your liking.  I always opt for the tom-yum soup - it has a bit of sourness to it which is nice.   All of the noodles already come with some vegetables (without having to add) so that's a plus - you are essentially able to pick what meat/protein you want since the veggies are already covered.   Atmosphere and service is normal/slightly better than your usual Asian spot.   THE BOTTOM LINE: great customizable noodles in an above average Asian joint."}
{"text":"Deer Gardens is one of the few locations I can count on a decent Laksa soup base. It seems that fewer and fewer establishments are willing to include this delicious coconut-spicy soup base in their menu offerings. I have had this in two separate locations and both times the dish was consistent and equally tasty.  For their main noodle menu, you tailor your noodle soup with custom ingredients and a side drink. I always get beef slices and fish fillet as it seems to be the best choices for the buck. In addition, you can order side dishes such as wings and pork chop for a premium. I usually just opt for the noodle soup and drink, which is already quite a bit to consume. The prices for this set have gone up over the years, but honestly what hasn't?"}
{"text":"The food here is great! However the service not so much.    When I don't receive good service I normally don't tip, so when I didn't tip one of the ladies there said \"you know the price doesn't include tip\". Thought that was a little desperate and unnecessary. I was put in a weird situation and tipped her even though I was not satisfied with the service provided by anyone working there. Reluctant to go back."}
{"text":"Service in this place is NONEXISTENT. the girl that was given the task of placing people to tables is rude and does not ask you if you want to share a table, she just places you with random people without asking.  The girl also rushes people out of their seats by placing the bill on your table while not all the food has been served yet.  I don't know what to say.  NOT COMING BACK EVER"}
{"text":"Went there over the weekend the first time.  Ordered hot lemon tea, noodles with tomato and pumpkin broth with beef tendon and pork liver as the toppings.  Great service.  Place is pretty clean and family oriented.  $15 including tips for a bowl of noodles that definitely makes me full.  No MSG whatsoever.  Not thirsty after the meal.  A plus!  I will definitely come back  ----------- Went back and concluded just need the noodles The upgrades and sides are not worth the calories"}
{"text":"This is the place to go whenever I want noodle soup :). I love their laksa soup! It's soo good, makes me regret it a little when I'm dying from the heat bit I love the flavor.   When I'm not feeling spicy, I just have their original fish base. Honestly, I've never ate anything else here lol.   Service is quick and food is always consistent. They're always busy! Even late at night.   10% off sometime in the afternoon and after 9pm. Please double check, not sure if they'll change the policy in the future."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for dinner. From the moment we walked in it wasn't the most pleasant of experiences. When telling the waitress at the door we needed a table for two, she instantly offered us a nearby table. The problem was that there was another party of two who came before us, and for some reason the waitress either didn't know or ignored this fact. We suffered the brunt of the other party's displeasure rather than the waitress and no apology or even acknowledgement of this was given by the staff.  Food wise, I ordered the malay laksa soup base with beef slices, cuttlefish, and flat rice noodles. My friend got the Szechuan soup base with imitated crab meat, seaweed (luckily it's the 'fresh' kind! not the packaged dry flaky ones) and egg noodles (which I liked more than my flat rice noodles, though I got WAY more noodles than she did). In my opinion, both orders were mediocre. They weren't incredible but they weren't awful either. They are fairly spicy and if you can only eat a little spice like myself, then your tongue will be on fire for most of the meal.  Something I liked was that they included a drink with their noodle combos. But beware! Even though they say any drink in the 'HK style drink' menu comes with their combos, you may have to pay an extra cost. The extra cost is simply the difference between the price of your drink compared to the cheapest ones on the 'HK style drink' menu. So my drink was ~$2.25 and the cheapest ones were ~$1.75, therefore I had to fork out the difference of 50 cents. Though not a crazy difference, it would have been nice to know of before I got the bill.  With the bill totaling to $20, we paid $25 in cash expecting change back before we tipped. After waiting a long time and not receiving any change we asked a waiter to follow up on it. Not only did he give us ridiculous attitude but he never came back with our change after another long wait. It's not that we minded tipping more but customers tip for the service they receive and the customer service we experienced through our meal was definitely not worth the amount they refused to give back to us.   In the end we just left without getting our change and I certainly will not be going back nor am I recommending this restaurant to any of my friends or family. Definitely disappointed with this dining experience overall."}
{"text":"2.5. Pretty average. After a pretty long day at the office and hearing news that a watermelon had exploded all over my carpet, I decided that it would be best to grab a bite out before heading home. I'm happy to report that they have air conditioning here, since it's been a blistering few days; not ideal noodle soup weather.  Having been here a few times, and with no change to the menu, I quickly made up my mind: some thick rice noodles drowning in chaochou style dried fish and minced pork fish soup, topped with sliced beef briskets and fish filets, and a side of chili oil (you have to ask for it). A short wait and steaming noodles arrived! The soup base is light in consistency, milky in colour with a gentle, rich flavour of which I lack the requisite vocabulary to describe. The bottom line is that it's a good soup. I enjoy adding a little bit of chili oil to enhance the flavour, otherwise I do find that the soup with the noodles is a little on the light side.  The soup comes with an ample amount of napa cabbage (so I don't really see the point of adding extra vegetables). The fish filet that comes in the soup is your standard white fish - the kind that is amply stocked in every Chinese grocery store (probably basa). The brisket was a little on the tough side, but still amply seasoned, even after being immersed in the soup. If you take the time to chew through the beef, you can appreciate this. The noodles were very soft, and I probably would have liked them to be less so, but at least the level of softness has been consistent.  Overall it's not too bad, but for the exact same dish and toppings, you can get better (and slightly cheaper). Would I return? Yeah, but it isn't my top choice for noodles."}
{"text":"Lots of good custom made noodles here make this a good go-to whenever you are feeling hungry.  When I came in here with recommendations from some friends, I wasn't sure what to expect, but came away impressed.  Deer Garden's signature is its make your own noodles menu, and they have some interesting choices to make it more special than your run of the mill noodles.  I chose to have beef brisket, pumpkin on glass noodles, with a peppery gingko nut broth.  I thought the portions would be small, but they do not disappoint, and I had to struggle to finish everything.  The gingko nuts and pumpkin were what made the noodles special, as not many places have those topping choices.  I would come in again just to try all the different combinations."}
{"text":"I come here a lot with my friends and girlfriend, of course for the soup noodle. Definitely my favourite place to go for soup noodle. You fill out the order sheet (soup base, two toppings, type of noodle, and a drink. Drink can cost you extra depending on what you get).  I always get the laksa. It has a little spiciness to it, which I really like. Their soup noodle comes with decent amount of meat, and it already contains some veggies (like mushrooms, cabbage, etc.) so I always pick two meats for my toppings.   Overall, very good portion for the price!"}
{"text":"Deer Garden used to be my favorite noodle place.  I think their soup bases are better than other noodle places of its type (make-your-own noodle). Since it's a fish soup base, do expect a slight fish smell and flavour.  The other options such as pepper soup is really peppery - almost too much.  I really like their pumpkin soup variation.  Also, I like that noodles by default already come with cabbage and greens.    However, I cannot bring myself to come here as often as I'd like due to their bad service. This place is very busy and very little staff.  You will never get any staffs' attention - getting extra napkins, ordering extra sides, wrong drink, getting the bill.  With the amount of business they are getting, I hope they can afford to hire more staff."}
{"text":"Food is quick and hot. The flavour is there and the high ceiling makes it that much easier to enjoy my comfort food.   It's easy for $9.75:  on the sheet of paper choose your soup base($1.50 extra to change), two toppings (extra is $1.75  per extra item) noodle type, drink (cold drink is extra $0.50) and side order $2.75 each. Depending on what you choose, it may be applicable to extend charges.   Free drinks included in the noodles include milk yea, coffee, lemon tea, almond milk, ovaltine  mill, horlick milk.  OR  you can choose rice off the menu etc.   Overall I'd  definitely come back for some hot warming comfort food at a good price. It's filling and it's worth it.   Parking lot is hard to get a spot though at though."}
{"text":"Quick service and good food, always a convenient and yummy place for lunch.  I usually get the parsley and century egg fish soup.  Portions are large so I tend to get just 1 meat item and 1 veggie.  Tried the laksa soup base for the first time this week.  It's not as think ans saucy like real laksa broth, byt still tates good and goes well with fish balls.  Meal comes with a drink and I recommend the hot almond milk.  Add a side for $2.75, fried chicken wings (3pcs) and teriyaki chicken steak are both good choices."}
{"text":"Despite having ordered a terrible combo during my first visit, I'd have to say that, after trying a couple other soup bases, I am a huge fan of the Malay laksa soup with japchae noodles.  The deep fried pork cutlet is always awesome too.  I would also highly recommend the coconut milk tea.  It the perfect drink to cool you down after a spicy meal.  Having revisited this place and another Deer Garden location in Richmond Hill, the service and overall atmosphere at this location is lacking.  This location also definitely has a much stronger fish odor and this is partly due to the poor ventilation.  The food is great here though.  If you know what you're doing, you can get an excellent meal for great value.  If you want awesome food and a better dining experience overall, driving over to the Richmond Hill location might be worth your while."}
{"text":"Having been to this location and the one in North Scarborough, I'd have to say this location is hands down my favorite.  The ventilation in the restaurant is BETTER (much less fish odor) and the service is way better too.  The food here is great if you know what you're doing.  You just fill out the soup combo order form and 5-10 minutes later, hot soupy goodness is served.  My favorite soup base is the Malay laksa soup base and I always pair that with the Korean glass noodles.  The beef slices with fish soup base combo is alway iffy for me, but everything else I've picked has been great.   The pork chop side dish is pretty damn good too!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish soup. The broth was milky and tasty without any MSG. However the portion is quite big so you can order 1 bowl for 2 people. Beef brisket is also nice and tender too."}
{"text":"Not the best but not the worst. Ordered the laksa soup base but I find the portion is bit small. The chicken wings were great tho and the drink."}
{"text":"This place is mostly known for their customizable noodle and soups with all their different side order possibilities, but I recently discovered they do good stuff with their rice bowls as well! You can get your choice of drink (obviously stuff like a red bean float cost extra) and then rice with eel and egg. Side orders of beef tongue are affordable and give you some extra stuff to go with the rice since there might not be enough meat for some people who need more accompaniments with their rice.   I find service is a bit hit or miss but it's a big restaurant and there's a lot going on. On the bright side it is spacious and always clean!"}
{"text":"Okay place & okay service. Prices are lower but would only recommend coming here if you have no other choice. I got their udon & hong style drink (11$ special) and I didn't know it was possible to have just mediocre udon until today. The Hong style tea also wasn't flavourful. I've ordered a few random things here before- spicy fries & wings. Spicy fries are a large serving & tasty but not actually spicy. And their chicken wings are surprisingly really good. Overall this isn't a must visit place & would only come here if I have no where else to go."}
{"text":"I like this place because it's easy. You can customize everything by simply checking off boxes as opposed to speaking to the wait staff - not that I'm antisocial or anything but there is a language barrier at times.  I've been here a handful of times and usually get the eel rice or laksa noodles. I find everything here generously portioned with a drink included which is nice and they're pretty consistent. The quality isn't the best for reasonable for what you're paying for. The staff can be a bit nicer but I understand the lunch/dinner rush - they just want you in and out."}
{"text":"My mom loves this place because there is no MSG in their soup. It's great to customize your own noodle bowl. And I love how udon does not cost extra here. Today I got the beef tendon as topping but thought it was undercooked. Soup and noodles were great. I forget you could get bubble tea here so I should have opted for that by paying 1.99 extra. Would be great if they had some afternoon tea specials but that's only applicable for take out."}
{"text":"This place should have been called Fish Garden, since all the decor and design seemed to be about fish. What's the meaning of the deer?  Anyway, this noodle house is pretty busy during the lunch and dinner hours, but we were lucky enough to get a table. The ordering system is really neat! Just tick off what soup base you want, type of noodles, toppings, etc... very fun. I highly recommend the fish soup base because it has no MSG, and doesn't taste fishy at all. It's very clean tasting and you won't be caught thirsty a few hours later.   Ingredient quality is great, overall a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much when we decided to come here.   First off,  if was packed with people lining up to get in.  Good thing most were waiting for a table for more than 2 people so they were waiting for a long time.   We got a table for 2 pretty quickly.  This was a cold night and I wanted a hot bowl of noodle... So this was suppose to be the place to get one!  Apparently it's known for their noodles.  Essentially you can pick your soup base, toppings,  and types of noodles and also a drink.   They also have rice dishes and appetizers.   I wanted something spicy so I picked the peanut sauce chilli soup base. For the toppings I picked the sliced beef brisket and beef tendon balls.  Lastly the noodle I wanted was udon.  When my bowl came it was nice and hot just the way I like my noodle.  It was a hearty thicker soup since it's peanut based but it was delicious.  It went very well with the udon, brisket and beef tendon balls.  It was nice and spicy too.  However I didn't like the sliced brisket too much.  I expected it to be soft and tender.  Instead, it was tough and chewy.  The beef tendon balls were on point though.  We also ordered the BBQ sausage with honey glaze and a plate of cow tongue as apps.  The cow tongue (2 big slices) was pretty good.  It wasn't chewy and tasted good.  I just wished they scrubbed off the bumps that are on the tongue.  At least you know it's a real tongue!  The BBQ sausage was nothing special but it did hit the spot.  I also picked a cup of hot ovaltine as my drink which is included with the combo.  Again perfect for a cold winter day.   Overall my noodle was delicious.  It was very busy and waiters are running around so you'll have to wave your hand like mad to flag them down... That never bothered me before.   Would I come back again?  Yup!"}
{"text":"Love their noodle combo. Big portion and tasty  soup. I always order the Thai Tom Yum Soup with thick rice noodle. Never let me down. Everything included, price under $15,even with a hot/cold ice tea/milk tea."}
{"text":"This place is known for their noodle in fish soup where you can customize your soup base, meat and vegetable toppings, and noodles. It also comes with one free drink from a selection of basic asian hot drinks. You can also add a little bit of money to upgrade it to a cold or speciality drink. They also have inexpensive add on sides! The service is quick and food is served well presented and hot.  I ordered a laksa malaysian soup base with sliced beef and fish fillet with thick noodles. The soup base was rich in flavour and not too spicy...reminded me of the ones I had in Singapore. The meats were also very good in texture and absorbed the soup so well. The noodles were cooked to a decent consistency but next time I would try a different kind. I upgraded my drink to a cold milk tea for a dollar extra and I have no regrets! It came in a take out bubble tea sealed cup and it was very flavourful and not too sweet. I also ordered the fried chicken wings to share and it was crispy as well.  My parents ordered a pork offal braised in fish soup with rice. It was okay in my opinion because I never really eat this type of internal meats anyways. The soup base was a little too peppery."}
{"text":"I love coming here!  It comes with a free hot drink! Its $1 extra to change it to a small cold drink, or $2 extra to change it to a special large drink. A bonus is that they always give you the cold drinks in a plastic to-go bubble tea cup instead of a glass, so I always end up bringing the drink home since I can never finish it in the restaurant.  If you go during peak times, its always busy so expect to wait if you have more than 2 people.  You can also add side dishes for around $2 each if you're super hungry (maximum 2 per person)! However, I'm usually full and satisfied with just the bowl of noodles :)"}
{"text":"My go to place when I'm craving a hot bowl of soup noodles. It's quite crowded on the weekends so you may have to wait 15-20 minutes to get a seat. You can customize everything from your soup base, type of noodles (eg. Vermicelli, udon, thick noodles) and choose two toppings (you can add more for an additional price). It also comes with a drink (there are a few options that are free but most people will opt to upgrade their drink to a bubble tea since it's fairly cheap with the combo (around $2.50-$3). I've often opted for the Laksa base which has a bit of spice but for the average person it shouldn't be too spicy. If I'm not mistaken it's approximately $10 a bowl of soup noodles"}
{"text":"Not bad not bad, customizable noodle bowl lol great idea! tried the Malay laksa soup base yummm!"}
{"text":"3rd location of Deer garden.  Place is smaller but same menu and all.  When we got there it was a zoo but it die down quick.  The people in front of us made a huge mess as the kids were playing with sugar and had it all over the table and booth.  The server cleaned the table and push all the sugar on the booth seat and didn't even bother cleaning that up.  You can expect same good quality as other locations."}
{"text":"Great noodle bar will write a better review next time I'm there. It was a bit of a rushed meal"}
{"text":"Love how you can custom your noodle soup.  Start by picking a soup base (around 10 variety) The fish stock ones doesn't have MSG as well.  Next pick your noodles and 2 toppings from a large list. (Add $1.75 for an extra one).  You get a get a hot drink included (coffe, tea, etc) Can upgrade to other drinks for additional (eg cold drinks, lemon tea, read bean, etc). And lastly you can add a side for $2.75. (wings, pork chop, etc).  Portion here is Huge for $10.75. Price went up since the first time I visited but still not bad.  Overall pretty good place but it does get very busy during lunch/dinner time so prepare to wait."}
{"text":"This is a build your own noodle place. You can choose the soup base, type of noodle, & toppings for $10.75 + tax , which also includes a drink. They have quite a variety of everything. With that combo, you can also get a side order for $2.75. Aside from the noodle soup bowls, they also have other set rice and noodle dishes. The dishes are very filling and they also come pretty quickly. My favourite cold drink to get is the lemon ribena which is just lemons, club soda, and ribena (blackcurrant juice). I come here quite often for a quick fix! Would recommend the build your own noodle soup bowl!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out! The make-it-your-own noodles menu is very similar to Lucky Noodles and the format is identical (i.e. pick your soup, noodles and 2 toppings). They also had other menus for drinks, combo meals and appetizers.  We went to have dinner here at around 6:30pm and the place wasn't overly crowded thankfully and we didn't have any trouble finding parking as there were still a ton of spaces available. Phew! This is in Times Square afterall...asian central and annoyingly dumb drivers as we all know.  I got the Thai Tom Yum Goong Soup with the Korean glass noodles, beef brisket and choy sum as toppings. I also tried out their chocolate milk tea. Both were pretty good, no complaints. I found the Tom Yum soup here was a tad spicier which was awesome and their milk tea was actually pretty decent and comparable with all those bbt places.  The presentation and layout of the restaurant is quite neat. Modern-looking, comfortable, enough space to get around and clean. Service was good, can't say 100% for sure it was spot on since it wasn't busy. Gotta probably come here at a busy time to test that out. Waiters/waitresses were nice and helpful.  Food came out at a reasonable timing and tasted good.  Overall pretty cool place to go to or try if you are smart about choosing the appropriate times to hit up this busy area and feeling for some noodles in your tummy."}
{"text":"You can customize your own noodles. You can pick your own soup base, toppings, noodles, and a drink. The combo is $9.75. There are also side dishes you can order for an additional cost. As well as special drinks which you pay extra.  I enjoyed the laksa soup base with thick rice noodles, fish tofu, and sliced beef brisket. The soup has a slightly lighter coconut taste than your regular laksa, however, it was still good. I don't usually drink soup, but when I do, you know it's good. That was the case here!   The gingko and pepper soup base was very light. It wasn't very salty which was good and had a strong pepper taste. The beef tendons were also well cooked.   The hk style milk tea that comes with the combo came in a heat-saving cup which was pretty cool. The milk tea was creamy and rich in flavour.   I heard that the deep fried fish fillet was very good, so I tried it out. It was fried nicely. The meat inside was tender and the crust was crispy. It also comes with a mayo sauce that you can dip your fillets in.  Another great thing is the drawer of utensils that are to the side of the tables. We wanted an extra fork and knife and the waitress came and opened the drawer. This is great for customers who want a few extra utensils, very easy access!  This is a great place if you want to customize your noodles, the portions are large too! I recommend getting the laksa soup base!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite noodle place because there are so many choices so there is always something for everyone, and also the noodles are delicious! My favourite is the tom yum soup base with Korean noodles . There have been a few times when the soup base was noticeably more watery than usual, but both times were during the time between lunch and dinner so maybe the actual chefs are on break or something. Other than those few odd times this place is great. I have been noticing the prices keep going up and up though!"}
{"text":"deer garden is one of my favourite noodle places! lots of choices to customize your noodle and portion size is plenty. always comes super hot  I've only been during the day and it seems to always get really busy by 12-1230"}
{"text":"2.5  I like noodle soup but this place isn't good. Sorry, but there's not one redeeming quality about this place.  It almost makes me miss the ayce sushi restaurant that used to be there - and that place wasn't even good."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday when it opened, so we got a seat real quick. The decor is very nice and spacey. Waitress and waiters were at the opposite side of the entrance, which was a little odd, but perhaps it was too early in the morning.   I ordered the tomyum soup with glass noodles, beef tripe, pigs blood, and while my partner ordered fish soup with pork intestines and beef tendon. Both our dishes came with some vegetables as well. We also got to get a drink as side - he ordered HK milk tea and I ordered almond milk. My order was so delicious! I loved every aspect of it. My partner's however, was a bit too bland for my liking. However, he seemed to enjoy it. There was so much noodles in my dish that I didn't finish my order at all. I ended up giving 1/2 my noodles to my partner. I do have  comment for the drink - mines was insanely grainy.   Overall,it's really good if you know what you like. Service was fine.  I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome. Better than the one in Richmond hill. I'm originally from Vancouver and this restaurant started there first and this location tastes the most similar. I love their rice dishes.  I guess maybe I had their soup combo too many times in the past so I had it maybe once there. Get the Maggi sauce pork cutlet on rice. Ask for extra soy sauce if you need to. The service isn't bad but it's no 5 stars for sure.  They need to wait too many tables and often forget your requests.  I would suggest you to ask them whatever you need when they are at your table cause once they are gone, it's hard to get their attention again. The line up is long but it moves pretty fast.  There will be a slight wait so I suggest you get a table while the other person parks. Parking is one is the main reasons why I don't come here more often. It is a search on its own."}
{"text":"Their service is horrible... reason why they deserve a 2 star only is because the soup noodles were decent.  I waited to be seated for almost 30minutes on many yet to be cleaned tables. It took me 15 minutes to get some service to eventually get my food ordered, not only did it take 15minutes, our food took almost 25 minutes to come to the table.  As soon as the noodles that i ordered (which was exceptional), I asked for hot sauce which never came...so i asked another waiter to give me some hot sauce, nor did he give me any. Why is it so hard to get me some hot sauce!! NOT ONLY THAT.. I had to ask for an extra bowl so that my bf and I can share the noodle we ordered... I mean it is obvious.. we need at least one bowl to share 1 bowl of  noodles.. COMMON SENSE...   So eventually they gave us a bowl, with no spoon, (so i'm gonna eat a bowl of noodles that has soup without a spoon... ok...)(which i did because they take forever to service whats obvious which concluded me to not even bother asking anymore)..   Soon after we finished our meal, we asked for the bill. NO PROBLEM. GETS THE BILL RIGHT AWAY, but GIVES THE CHANGE 15minutes later!   Anyway you get the point right? service is terrible.  Also there was a lady screaming at the waiter in mandarin , which actually at least made me feel better about going here."}
{"text":"No they don't serve deer meat here folks, it's a customized bowl of steaming hot noodles in your face though!  Yes the Asian comfort food for the cold cold country known as Canada, is perfect for those winter evenings or crispy fall nights.  The GF and I however decided to come here on a hot summer day for dinner.  She had heard a lot of great things about this place from various yelpers, so we decided to try it out.  First off, the menu is rather complicated.  Simply put, there is a $1.50 extra charge for fish soup, but half the soups are fish, while the other half are spicy.  They should just tack that $1.50 on the meal price of $9.75 and be done with it.  Secondly, the drinks are included ONLY if you order the correct hot drink from the spreadsheet they have listed (you have to ask for it).  If you don't pay attention to this Deer Garden Final Exam, you could end up creating a combo that gets a bit on the pricey side (remember it's Cash Only, so pad that wallet for your date fellas).  I ordered thick rice noodles, with fish/shredded pork soup and brisket/pork blood as my bowl.  It came out quick and the amount of food was quite generous.  The flavours were great, but to be frank it seemed like a bowl I could create at any Hot Pot place throughout the city.  It's an interesting concept, but I'd rather ad a bit more for an AYCE hot pot experience instead.  I'll come back though...probably not until winter is coming though."}
{"text":"The value at Deer Garden is simply great. It's a tad bit more expensive than some of the lunches you can grab around the area, but it's cleaner and always a good choice if you're craving noodles. You may have to wait for a table!"}
{"text":"This place makes really nice noodle soups, would definitely recommend them! My favorites are the fish soup base and the tom yum, all the noodles are great too! I haven't tried anything else on the menu, so I can't speak much about that, but the noodle soups are solid. The cool bird decorations on the ceiling is a nice touch too!"}
{"text":"Jus food this place and I'm in love! That laksa soup! I can't seem to find it any where eles! There is only one place I know that makes it better and it's in mtl called satay brothers! The amount of option you get! From topping to noodle to soup to drink....  Must try and for 10$ u will be stuffed!!!  Decor is nice, only thing is they try ad group every one together even if there is room in the restaurant, also they don't care if u eating they will clean and mop right around you! Not so classy"}
{"text":"My go-to for fish soup noodles. There are other options but fish noodles is what they're known for. I love how the soups have no msg! The customization and variety of this place is also pretty extensive! I've tried all the fish soup bases and toppings, but my favourite is the tomato and pumpkin fish soup with korean crystal noodles, and double beef tendon. The sides are also a great addition to the noodles, like the beef tongue and spam. Its 9.75 for each bowl, and each side is 2.25. Its decently priced for what we're given. Theres a lot of noodles, soups and toppings so its pretty worth it. It has increased in price these past years but its still worth it. They also have there own XO chili oil sauce, which is packed with spice and flavour. Overall, a great place for noodle folk!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Very delicious soup ad wide range of choices for side dishes with soup. Price is also reasonable. However, tight seats and need to wait at rush hour."}
{"text":"Love this place:)  Really like the tomato and Tom yum soup base. They always give u a lot of veggie and the smoothie that u can order with the combo is good too   I keep coming back for it! Service is okay but not the best... Always have to line up!"}
{"text":"Woah, this location is so much more relaxed, it almost makes it worth the drive all the way here so I'm not crowded the entire time I'm here.   No wait time and sat down super quick. The menu is the exact same as the other Highway 7 location, so it made ordering quite simple.   Noodles were just as good as the other location, but I found it odd that I ordered extra noodles that came in a separate bowl, without soup... By the time I got to my extra noodles, they were all dried up and sticking together.  Quick overall service, and the servers were quite good. A bit odd that they only spoke mandarin, even if you spoke to them in any other language, but the message got across and everything came out fine.   If you like your Deer Garden noodles without the super long wait and crowd, U would recommend this location any day!"}
{"text":"Good price, delicious food! Their signature dish is the fish noodle bowl, and you can choose to add things like other kinds of sliced meat and tofu in it. I recommend adding the fish tofu!  The bowl was pretty big for me, and I was not able to finish eating everything in it.  Perfect for a winter night.  Be sure to come early as it gets crowded into the evening. We went at around 6pm at a group of 4 on a Sunday evening, and did not need to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Honestly, I dread coming to the plaza and eating here as there never seems to be parking and no one ever understands that one back road is one way only, but I gotta admit that coming to Deer Garden isn't always bad. I'm always happier after I have a big bowl of noodles.  Of all the noodle bars in the area, Deer Garden is one of the better ones for me. Good variety in all aspects of the bowl: soup base, noodles, and ingredient options. There are a numerous amount of different combinations you can create. Side dishes are quite good as well, but are not included in the bowl price. You do have to pay a little extra, but the pork cutlet and chicken wings area all good.  With a beverage that comes with, you have an option of cold or hot. My brother brought up an amazing point where the noodles are quite hot, and as you eat the bowl, you get warmer and warmer. It is probably a good idea to get a cold drink with your bowl, as it will help cool you down as you eat! Definitely something to keep in mind! #lifehacks  The only downside to this restaurant is that there is ALWAYS an enormous wait. Lines for days, and then some! If you have a larger party (more than 4 or 5 even), I would most definitely recommend reserving a table. Service isn't too bad here, but the servers aren't usually in the most cheerful mood as they always seem to be in a rush and quite stressed. I can imagine how they feel with such a busy restaurant though, so I can't exactly blame them for it.  Overall a decent priced noodle bar that you can visit, granted you get a parking spot and then a table. Definitely worth a try as it is one of the better quality restaurants in the area for noodles!"}
{"text":"For regulars, a heads up that the prices have increased. I think what used to be the $8.95 noodle combo is now $9.25. The add-ons, like pork cutlet, are now $2.25, up from $1.95. And they now have fewer choices of free drinks, with cold drinks like lemon ribena now cost an extra $0.50. These were the price changes I noticed, but I didn't scan the rest of the menu.  The noodles come with a few vegetables, like nappa cabbage and mushrooms, so don't worry about picking two meats as toppings. I've tried the malay laksa, peanut & chili, and one of the fish soups though I can't remember which. All three were enjoyable, but the peanut chili (also known as \"dam damn meen\" in Cantonese) is definitely my favourite. If you like peanut flavours, this is perfect for you. I've had minor issues with there not being enough soup on some days and the soup being too watery on other days, but most of the time, it's a nice, thicker soup with strong flavour.   My favourite cold drink (and by \"favourite\", I mean \"the only one I've ever ordered over and over again\") is the strawberry smoothie. You get a good amount for an extra $2 as it comes in a bubble-tea takeout cup and tastes great. It could benefit from a little more blending as sometimes there are chunks of ice that are too big for the straw, but it's never been a big enough issue for me to change my mind on the overall taste.  Seating is not a big issue and while there are usual wait times for core meal hours, I haven't experienced a wait longer than 20 minutes, even for a group of eight.  While there are a few areas that could be improved, if you like noodles in soup, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"They use to be decent with a 3 star in my opinion for a decent bowl of quick eat, until lately. They've started mimicking HK store movement, where they start seating people at your table when you're not even done. They throw you the bill and ask you to pay so that you can leave the moment you finish. This place can now go screw itself from now on, I rather eat at a Wendy or McD than to dine here."}
{"text":"Dropping two stars down to 3 stars because there seems to be some changes with the restaurant to both prices and ingredients. I found my Szechuan soup way too salty and the glass noodles I ordered had a different texture than normally.  The prices also got bumped up to 9.75 so it's not cheaper than anything else in the area."}
{"text":"One of my favourite noodle places! I love the DIY-ness of the noodles.   I always get the laksa which is super flavourful and is almost just as good as laksa from Malaysian places!   For $10.75 you get noodle soup, choose your own base, 2 toppings and a drink. You can pay extra for their special drinks.  Service is fast and efficient. What you expect at a Chinese place so no complaints!   The portions are huge and I never leave hungry - just wanting more if I could eat more."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick and cheap meal, this is it. You can pick your soup base, noodles, and toppings. $10 gets you a huge bowl of noodles and a drink. Sides are $2.25 + taxes.  I like the small detail of there being drawers attached to each table that hosts extra napkins, spoons and chopsticks so you don't have to waste time flagging down servers who find those requests tiresome.  My one disappointment is that they ran out of ho fun and bok choy when i went last night, and i was stuck not satisfying my craving. I was not impressed that a noodle place ran out of noodles. Bad planning.  Restaurant size is good for a party of 4 max. More than that, and it is a bit of a hassle."}
{"text":"I love coming here for their noodle soups! For $9.95, you choose your soup base, type of noodles, two choice of \"toppings\" and a drink. My favorite soup base is the laksa, however, it is on the spicy side, so if you can't handle spicy food, don't get this one. I've also tried the gingko and pepper soup base, which is also pretty good. There's quite a variety of items to choose for their toppings, from meat to veggie items. The free drinks includes quite a few choices of hot drinks, cold drinks is an extra $1, and the more special drinks are a bit more $$. The portion is pretty good, and I'm always stuffed after finishing my bowl of noodles. However, if you think it's not enough, there are also some side dishes to choose from for $2.25 each.  Service is pretty fast. They are usually pretty busy when I come here on the weekends for dinner. When the restaurant first opened, the wait times were quite long. However, the last few times I visited, I never had to wait for more than 10 mins."}
{"text":"Cleaner, brighter, and a larger restaurant than any of the other \"thick noodle specialty\" places that I've been to. However, I also found this place to be more expensive ($9.75 for a bowl which is $1-2 more than Lucky Noodles) and less tasty.  I ordered the pumpkin and tomato soup base and chose beef slices and century egg as my two toppings. The flavour of the soup base was just mediocre - I didn't enjoy it that much and the pumpkin slices were more like pumpkin rind slices.. The rest of the toppings were ok but like I said, nothing special and nothing that would make me want to choose this place over others."}
{"text":"My favourite is tomato & pumpkin fish soup and pan seared ox tongue!!! Sooooo good:)"}
{"text":"This restaurant specializes in noodle soup. They provide you a list, where you check off the ingredients that you're interested in. For example, they have many options on the soup base, the types of meat and vegetables to choose from. Very organized and friendly for those that can only read English.  I ordered the fish soup broth and was tasty. I order a bowl of flat rice noodles, which wasn't overly or under cooked. The meal sets come with a side order of a drink (milk tea, lemon tea, etc). They have another many available if you're not into noodles and soup. You can order side dishes like chicken wings, rice bowls and a variety of other Asian dishes.   Place was well lit, clean, and nice interior design. They were accommodating to our large group of 15 people and pushed the tables together for us. Price is pretty decent as well. If you're up for a quick bite and you're craving noodles, I would recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Same as the name, they are selling FISH SOUP base + whatever you choose from the menu.  I like their simple menus, check off your DIY noodle in their soup bases Of course, get their selling point 'Fish soup base\"  Personally I like parsley with duck egg!!  Quality: Good Service: Good Price: $10 average per bowl with a hot drink or extra for cold drink. Tips: Go in between afternoon tea time , Price is cheap and big bowl portion for hungry man!! :)  Will come back just because of the fish soup base and their laksa is VERY GOOD!!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite noodle soup restaurants in town!  To order you choose your soup base, noodles, ingredients and a drink.  You also have the option to add side dishes, but the large bowl of noodles is usually enough for me.  The combo comes with a hot drink, but I typically add $1 for the cold milk tea.  If you add a bit more money, you can get the specialty drinks, such as bubble tea.  But I find that their specialty drinks aren't very good, so I prefer the regular milk tea.    My favourite soup base is the century egg fish soup!  But I also really like the tomatoes & pumpkin fish soup.  Both pair great with the thick rice noodles.  The environment is modern and really interesting if you pay attention.  Did you know you are actually sitting inside a fish?  Look up next time you visit!"}
{"text":"I only went there once after reading some good online reviews. It's totally over rated. The original flavor noodle soup which I ordered had strong fish guts smell,Unpleasant ?Maybe the squid in the soup is not so fresh?  The noodle is little chewy, a bit under cooked. The price is alright, 12 dollars for a bowl of noodle with a cup of hot drink. But there are plenty better place offer better quality noodles at the similar price range."}
{"text":"I've never really stepped outside of my comfort zone much, which says a lot that I give this place 4 stars.   I'm new to Asian cuisine, and I wouldn't have known about this place if a friend didn't take me. I'm glad he did.  I got the chicken broth based soup, beef slices, choy sum, and WOW it was delicious!   Also got the ovaltine hot chocolate and fried fish cutlet. Ovaltine - not too sweet, but savoury enough to satisfy, and the fish cutlet - not too fried, didn't feel heavy after.  Definitely going to come back."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick bite! delicious bowl of hot and satisfying noodles of your own choice of toppings , sides, noodles, soup base and drink! Great variety to please all taste buds. If you need a hearty hot soupy meal - this is definitely a place to stop by."}
{"text":"You get to choose your own noodles, soup base, and toppings with a choice of a hot drink for $10.95. They claim their soup bases are made without MSG, which is unique compared to many other Asian restaurants. I quite like their tom yum gong soup base and their original fish soup. I like their thick vermicelli noodles, which are actually Cantonese lai fun. They're chewy yet soft and their portions are large! I was only finished half my noodles and packed the rest home for lunch tomorrow.  I've only been here twice, but I would definitely return to try one of their pre-made noodles and soups."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! This review is based on their noodle soup combo.  My all time favourite is the fish soup here. Once in awhile I'll get the laksa (spicy).   As you probably know by reading the reviews, the restaurant's rise to fame is for their fish based soup. I must admit, I have yet to find another place that does it better. Even if fish is not your thing, you may be interested in their beef broth or Thai soup  Options.... who doesn't like options??!! You get to choose your soup base, 2 free toppings, type of noodle and a free hot drink. If your feeling really hungry, you can also get a side dish for additional $2.75.  Good place to bring anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Went there with a couple of friends and their daughter. It was a great noodle place. The concept is that you can created your own noodle dish. You choose the soup base, the noodle, and the toppings. They put it together and bring it to you. It is a really cheap noodle dish (I think, I didn't pay so I don't know).   My recommendation is the instant noodle, the malay soup base, and the toppings are your choice. I was not a fan of the vermicelli, but my wife got the instant noodle and it was very good.   The ingredients seem fresh (well, obviously the instant noodle can't be fresh), and it tasted really good. The only thing I didn't like was the service. It was the first time I was there and the lady didn't explain how to order. I asked, but she ignored me so I needed to get my friend to help me with it. I guess I was just a little bit slow. I always thought it was like every other location. The dishes are pre -made.   Overall, I like the location and will most likely go back when I get the chance."}
{"text":"Been to this place multiple times (mainly lunch hours) and its been a decent experience. Make sure you get a number from the front as there is usually a wait. Pretty self explanatory process: if you're looking for noodles, fill out the form (hot lemon/milk tea is included) or order anything else on the separate menu. I ordered beef brisket & fish fillet with egg noodles and the century egg fish soup. The broth is actually quite good and with no MSG! Portion size is alright as well.  But oh deer....the prices. I swear every time I return, the prices increase by 25 or 50 cents. I still remember when noodles were 8.75 a while back. At 10.75 (as at Dec 2017) however, its starting to feel less and less like a \"decent value\" meal.   Parking might be busy depending on the time of day given its location in Times Square, but I usually don't have any major problems. Service has usually been adequate though rushed at times."}
{"text":"Fish broth is now super watered down, practically no flavour at all...  Price is now $11.50 and sides are $2.95.  How disappointing!  Time to go to Dagu Rice Noodle!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while but decided was a good decision after a long night of drinking.   Deer Garden is a DIY noodle-soup restaurant, where you pick your soup-base, type of noodles, toppings and etc etc.   They're \"known\" for their fish-soup which is a traditional chinese soup. I didn't get that cause I'm adventurous AF and I like to be different.   You get a piece of paper which you can start ticking away at the various options you have for your noodle-soup. I opted for the Laksa soup-base with the Japchae Korean style noodles. For the toppings I chose the sliced beef and the mushrooms. The combo also comes with a drink please note that there is a extra charge for cold-drinks. Their HK Milk Tea is good but on the sweet side.   Theres also discounted side dishes that you can opt for but the noodles itself are quite filling ( i'm a big guy and couldn't finish)   Overall the meal was good not great, it comes pipping hot so maybe give it a few minutes before trying to destroy \"your creation\", the service was standard chinese where they don't come around and fill your water every 5 seconds and you have to flag a  waiter down if you want something but thats expected. I'd come back because its close to home and quality is decent at place.   I heard the Richmond Hill location is better for those in the York Region."}
{"text":"Great place to customize your meals!  You can ask for mild on the spicy soup base.  I've tried their malay laksa (mild) and their peanut sauce (mild) both was very delicious.  A rule of thumb with thick broth is to get with thick noodles so the soup can adhere to the noodles!  They also serve other food such as rice, wings, and appetizers  Reasonable portion size for the price and it also comes with a drink"}
{"text":"My parents love coming here. This place is always packed!!! It doesn't matter what time you come, there is always a line. Once we waited for almost an hour.  I personally love their cold black tea.  They are famous for their soup based. Every time we go for some reason they always get our order wrong. I think its a language barrier.... They don't understand Cantonese or English here. They only speak in mandarin here.   Otherwise their food is decent."}
{"text":"An average noodle soup joint. There's so many noodle soup joints now it is hard to compete. My mom quite enjoyed the fish soup here though.. not alot of msg and can taste the fish in the soup.  Also ordered the fried turnip cake and that was ok.. not the best. The good part here is when you order a noodle soup you also get a drink like milk tea or lemon tea.   If you're looking for chinese snacks/apps there is not much to choose from here.  Overall it's decent but sometimes you will need to wait in line to get a table."}
{"text":"No MSG broth? Sign me up! We had the original fish stock with some meats. And also another fish broth. I love the lighter taste. Ramen has been all the rage the past couple years and I was never really into such salty broth. Deer Garden's fish broth in contrast is exactly my cup of tea.  I really like how you can add a drink (especially HK milk tea) to the meal. This store understands what I like at a fundamental level. I also really like being able to choose my toppings and noodle types. It allows for customization and gives you good reasons to come back to try different combinations of broth/noodle/toppings.  Only disappointment was the side dish. The fish cakes were small and nothing special. I should try something else instead.  Portion and prices are on point. Not the cheapest place to get noodles but far from expensive. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"I had to give this place a shot after hearing all the hype about it. Deer Garden didn't impress me THAT much (maybe because I came here expecting some five-star noodles) but it didn't exactly disappoint either.  Undeniably a good noodle place in Markham. Except it's located in Times Square where parking is another one of those Pacific Mall nightmares.   Soup and noodle base price is $8.95 with a dozen different soup selections, includes up to two toppings, a variety of different noodles to choose from, and a drink (cold/hot tea/milk tea). Side dishes are a little over $2 and there's a limit of 2 side dishes per guest.   Not sure if it's because I came here on a Saturday afternoon where the restaurant seemed to be at its peak hours, but the place looked a little understaffed. The waitresses were running around frantically and it was really hard to get their attention for the bill... Then when we finally did manage to pay the bill, the waitress took a lifetime to bring back the change... Had to ask for the change twice because she kept forgetting. Took about 15 minutes to pay the bill when it could've taken 5 minutes max.  Overall had a good experience at Deer Garden. Delicious noodles in huge portions at such a cheap price! Surely I'll be coming here again (fingers crossed for better service next time)."}
{"text":"This place is probably my go-to noodle place.  The customization of noodle dishes is a real plus, and there's lots of variety so the possibilities really are endless. $8.75 for a large bowl of noodles and an HK style drink? Pretty good price if you ask me.  I usually get the udon with beef balls and pig intestine in parsley and century eggs fish soup. It's always piping hot, delicious and the soup really does not contain MSG as I'm never tempted to drink something while eating!  There are also side dishes to order, each 1.95 (max 2 per person). I really recommend the chicken teriyaki cutlet. I can taste it's always made to order and not frozen/pre made.  Never had a bad experience with the service. Always familiar faces who are attentive and quick to respond. No need to flag them down.  Great place for a filling bowl of noodles!"}
{"text":"Found a small bug in my noodle. The caterpillar kind you sometimes see on your veggies. Notified this to one of the staff and asked for the bill. I've lost any appetite I had. When the bill arrived the dish was not taken off the bill nor was there any sort of discount. Needless to say I will not be back.   The food was just average anyways."}
{"text":"Came here two times including tonight and the food is unchanged. Food was good and service was better than my first visit. They have to train the staff to check the door more often for new customers. My first visit was terrible.. My gf and I stood out by the front (cold as hell), waiting to be seated. Took them about 3-5 minutes to get to us.. There were tons of tables not taken, so there were no excuses in saying they were too busy. We'll see how they do the next time I visit again.  ~Feb.27,2014~ I'm very pleased with how quickly the hostess came over to acknowledge our presence. This time was WAY BETTER than my previous experience. +1 star for that. Food quality is still unchanged! Soup is good and generous portions for noodles.. Fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-3 Service-4 Food-4 Strikeouts-0/3  I personally think this restaurant has gotten down the efficiency aspect in spades. It is a sit down restaurant, but you can do the whole order yourself on a piece of paper giving you all the options without bothering the wait staff.  They advertise their soup as MSG FREE, so it's natural fish soup flavour. However, they have a ton of other soup bases you can choose from and you can customize everything to the type of noodles to the type of meat in the bowl. However, no matter how nice the bowl of noodles are, the best part is when ordering sides. You can order up to two grilled dishes, which taste fantastic and is only a small cost to get these dishes. The soup and noodles are definitely spot on, not too salty, but not too watered down too. I personally like pho more still, cuz it's missing the extra kick. Though I feel the sides do accomplish that. Definitely worth the bang for buck, though the drinks here are pretty average, so don't expect much."}
{"text":"Great place for customizing your noodles. They have many soup options to choose from and are all pretty good. I really like how this place gives you a lot of ingredients and are not stingy with it like some other places. They have many drink options as well which is nice. The side dishes didn't blow me away but we come for the noodles not the side dishes.  I would recommend the peanut sauce broth and the original broth."}
{"text":"dunno why it took me this long to write a review for this restaurant but anyways, it's all about the soup noodle customization (place boasts no MSG, supposedly) ive tried everything on the menu like twice each and my go to soup bases are peanut chili or malay laksa ... the fish soup is quite good too .... fave side dishes are the pan fried teriyaki chickn and deep fried pork chop ... also, did i mention these guys make fantastic milk tea? at least imo it was surprisingly good ... if u like a big bowl of noodles with veggies and meat of your choice then u need to try this place"}
{"text":"One of two locations in the Greater Toronto Area; originally from Vancouver. It's famous for its milky white \"fish based broth\", but non-fish is also available. If your used to stronger tasting broth like Pho or Ramen you will find the fish broth here too light. Which makes this a popular choice for family taking their grandma/pa out for dinner and those looking for a healthier alternative. That said this wasn't a meal I'll be craving for another visit anytime soon, but worth a try."}
{"text":"When hunger strikes and I'm in the area, Deer Garden comes to mind; it's on my go-to list. They've got variety, fast service, and good value. What more can you ask for?  Their soups and broths are clear, no hint of MSG. One of my all-time fave choice is their Peanut-Sauce & Chili soup noodle (???), I always get it here because I can't find a good one anywhere else! Your customized noodles are paired with a drink, HK-style. They also have rice dishes & snacks available. But of course, you'd come here for the noodles.  The restaurant is modern & clean. I've never had any trouble or confusion with the service here. This business knows what it's doing and I respect that."}
{"text":"They offer make your own noodle bowls. You select the broth (fish, spicy, laksa, etc.) and the type of noodle (rice noodle, vermicelli, potato noodles, etc.)  I recommend the rice noodles with laksa broth. Also add on the various side dishes for an additional toonie each. I like the sliced sausages and chicken fillet.  Mark deduction because the service can be a bit slow on busy days, had to raise my hand to get the wait staffs attention many times."}
{"text":"Their customizable noodle bowls are very popular, especially with the fish broth. Pretty large portions and they also come with HK-style drinks. The spicy broths are very good (Malay laksa or white pepper and ginkgo). The place is clean and efficient. Good for medium-sized crowds. Haven't tried any of their other dishes though, even though I've been here a few times. The only thing is that with the complimentary tea, the soup, and the accompanying drink, you'll definitely need to use the washroom right after eating, lol."}
{"text":"Why do you gotta be so rude?  Seriously, this must be one the rudest restaurants I've ever been to. I was with 3 other people and we thought that we've never been treated like this before. I went on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty busy. Everyone must have went there after church.  First the waitress collected the bowls before we were even done eating. At the same time, she gave the bill without asking. Minutes after that, she collected our drinks that I barely drank because it was still hot and told us they were busy and we had to leave! We're not kids and we weren't loitering, we didn't even finish out meal! It was past 1pm and the wait at the door was now only 3-4 people. I'm never going there again.  If you can tolerate the rude service, Deer Garden is your typical build-your-own noodle soup. Choose a soup base, noodles, 2 toppings and a (hot) drink for $10.75, which is cheap. Cold drinks are extra. However, it's not filling and I was hungry a few hours later (or maybe it was because I didn't finish my meal!). I sometimes have a bad reaction to MSG so I'm not a fan."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I've been here and this time was quite disappointing. There was no flavor in the soup... normally is quite flavorful. It tasted like water and noodles. The French Toast claims to have peanut butter in it but I didn't taste it at all. Bubble tea was decent."}
{"text":"Came here on a pretty cold night so hot noodles paired perfectly with the weather. It's another one of those customizable concepts where you can choose what to have in your bowl of noodles. You have a choice of the: soup base, 2 toppings, noodles, and drink ($1.00 extra for  cold drinks). They raised their prices again apparently to $10.50.  I ordered the gingko + pepper fish soup, Korean style glass noodle, beef briskets and choi sum, and a cold milk tea + coffee for my drink. All their fish soups apparently contain no MSG so that's an added bonus. I really liked my soup base since the pepper added a decent amount of kick for my baby intolerance level to anything spicy. I feel like for some people with larger appetites, the portion may be a bit small. However, for me it was just perfect. I feel like I did the right combo this time in terms of customizing my noodles. Overall a pretty good experience."}
{"text":"Huge bowl of noodles with two toppings for $11.99!  I like the pepper fish soup base. The pork intestines and pork blood are good here. No complaints food-wise. Comes hot!   However sometimes the drink takes a long time - make sure to follow up with them.   There's parking around the mall, but because it's in the corner of the mall, it's a bit scarce on parking around dinner time.   Nothing too special, just another noodle place, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I can't believe I had to share a table with two other people on a 4 seated table when there is so much open table. We are not in China!!!"}
{"text":"I think the one on silver star is much better. The service is pretty good. I can't say when it's really busy. It won't be my first choice to come here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places uptown! I absolutely love their noodle combos and often make an effort to drive all the way from downtown Toronto to satisfy my cravings for their soupy noodles. My favorite soup base is the fish soup with pumpkin. I would've given this place 5 stars but I hate having to wait (can get insane during peak hours) and also that they no longer have one of my favorite toppings, fish puffs."}
{"text":"Consistent fish soup and my go to. This is the second location I've tried (the other one across from pmall) and it's still good to me!   I recently tried their hot almond milk and it's actually pretty good!"}
{"text":"It's a simple made-to-order soup and noodles shop. It was filling enough but the toppings could be more generous for say, the meat balls as only 3 are in the bowl. Tip, wished I realized was they have some chili pots that aren't sitting on the tables but are available on request. My original fish soup base was good but a little punch of spicy would've been great. Overall, it's got good variety and for about $12-15 per person you have the soup and a drink."}
{"text":"The concept at this restaurant is build your own soup noodle.  They give you a piece of paper where you check the boxes to pick the noodle, broth and two toppings (vegetables and meat/seafood).  It also comes with a coffee or tea and all for $8.75 before tax and tip.  The serving size is quite decent but it is a little pricey relative to other Chinese soup noodle places in the area.  I suspect it's very popular due to the customization and so there is usually a 15 min+ wait for a table.  I recommend the tom yum or laksa broth the most."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to come for a bowl of noodles on a cool day.   Their noodle bowls are customizable and you order by marking what soup base, noodle, and toppings you want. The piece of paper you order on is generally easy to figure out.   I ordered the \"chaochou style dried fish and minced pork fish soup\". The fish soup base wasn't too fishy so I was fine with that. There are plenty of toppings in this bowl. You also get a drink as part of the combo. Overall, decent meal."}
{"text":"We came here on a cold winter day. This place has an easy to understand order sheet with a listing of various soup bases, type of noodles and two toppings of your choice. Additionally toppings are extra. It comes with a free hot drink with cold drinks being extra.   I decided to order the laksha base with beef balls and beef slices with rice noodles to warm up. The base was rich and spicy. The noodles were tender. I'd like to have an option to select thicker noodles (something other that Udon), but the ones that I ordered were nice and tender. The order also came with a free drink. I opted for a hot drink (Ovaltine). Overall for $10ish, it was good value. Will likely come again throughout the winter."}
{"text":"Deer Garden has instantly become one of my favourite restaurants to go to for Chinese noodle soup! I have been here a couple of times now and it never disappoints.   I love the concept of their ordering style for noodle soup dishes. You are given a sheet of paper with the following categories: soup base, toppings, type of noodles, drink, extras/etc. Under each category, there is a variety of options to choose from for you to customize your dish. The portions are huge, priced at $9.75. Worth it! The service however is just OK. As expected for a Chinese restaurant.   What you choose to include in your bowl will differ based on your personal preferences. I usually get the Malaysian Laksa or Tom Yum soup base - I find these two to be more flavourful/salty/sour, which I love. There are LOTS of toppings to choose from, and after trying a few, I just go for some of the lighter veggie options now (seaweed, bak choy) as the meat usually fills me up way too much. I've only tried the hot HK milk tea in regards to the drinks, and it tastes pretty bland. I'm not really a fan of most of the hot drink options, but you have to pay extra if you want your drink cold...  I haven't tried any of the other food items at Deer Garden yet, but I would recommend coming here for the noodle soup. It's affordable, tastes great, fills you up, and has a lot of variety!"}
{"text":"I was surprised that for a weekday night around 7:30pm, Deer Garden was full! Luckily, we didn't wait for a long time before we were seated. On one of the sets of seats, it's a little narrow, but they have a cute little basket on top of the row of cubbies for you to place your belongings.  Service is pretty fast - we were able to order our meal quite quickly, receive our food rather quick and get the bill fast too.  We ordered one of their noodle bowls and I got the unagi on rice. The noodle bowls costed $11.50 and the unagi on rice was around $12.50, a drink of $1.99 value was included and if you wanted to upgrade your drink, you could just add a bit more money. Their portions are quite large in my opinion, I thought the unagi on rice was pretty worth it because the unagi was quite large (took up about 1/3rd of the bowl).  The taste was okay, but the portion was pretty large that I only was able to finish about half of this."}
{"text":"Deer Garden (Dear Garden),  You definitely have grown the best customizable noodle restaurant on Highway 7!  Yours Truly,  A Customer For $9.50, you get to choose your soup base, noodles, topping and drink. Deer garden is all about that customization of your noodles. I can never finish these noodles because it's so MASSIVE. I HIGHLY advise you to share this with your friend if you can't eat that much, because I literally almost take the whole thing home. There are many types of noodles you can choose from, usually it's the ones that you choose from a local Chinese restaurant.   You can choose two toppings from the selection, a few include beef balls, beef, vegetables options such as greens. There are also side orders such as fried chicken wings, etc, for a smaller amount extra. Drinks are included, although if you want something a little special, you need to add extra money (about 50 cents to a dollar, or however much the drink is priced).  For the soup base, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the laksa. It's so good! I used to get the regular soup base, but man, after my friend got the Laksa soup base, I get it EVERYTIME."}
{"text":"Always a go to spot when I'm in the mood for noodles and broth.  I always get the original fish soup because it has no msg in them.  There is a great variety of choices from noodles, soup base,  and toppings. Specialty soups and after two toppings you will need to add additional money.  It also comes with a drink which is a typical HK style cafe drink such as milk tea."}
{"text":"I was in Vancouver this spring and tried it and loved it! So I decided to try the one in Scarborough here...the food is not as good as the one in Vancouver, but the serving size is the same...it's huge!   Atmosphere and decor is prettier than the one in Vancouver.   The only thing I didn't like about this place is the service. One of the servers gave us attitude when we asked for tea. We sat here for 10 minutes and already gave in our orders. We asked for tea and the server point into an area of customers and said, \"there's a lady going around with tea right now (which I did not see), so wait for it!\" If you're pissed that the restaurant is busy, get out of the food service industry, it's not meant for you."}
{"text":"Summary: novelty of customizing your own noodle order faces increasingly better competition, plus stingy pricing with unsatisfactory customer service detracts from solid specials   Top Must-Get: kumquat tea Top Regret: customer service  When Deer Garden first opened a few years ago, I was excited at the thrill of customizing your own noodle order - it was unique at the time. As more places popped up with a similar style though, the novelty wore off and the question became whether (and how) Deer Garden would sustain it's legacy.  The noodles are decent, and the drinks are actually pretty good (best kumquat drink I've had, actually)... But where it ultimately left a bad taste in my mouth was the service.  The overall vibe was that they wanted to take your money. I mean, it's a business - obviously making revenue is the goal, but the restaurant staff so blatantly doesn't care for your experience compared to your wallet that it gets outrageous.  You get seated soon enough, and they take your order - but never have I seen them bother to welcome you, explain the specials, offer to refill your water/tea, or outline how it works. It's rude compared to other noodle-customization restaurants and other restaurants in the area, which don't have a super high standard to start with.  The specials go for $2 less during downtime (I think it's 3 - 6 pm, and 9 - 11 pm). If you get there at 5:45 and put in your order at 5:59, odds are they will charge you the higher price. It's that kind of mentality I feel flabbergasted by.  Once, right after ordering, we got a call that was urgent and had to leave. I asked to change my meal to takeout. There is a 50 cent charge for packing your drink in a takeout cup, on top of the 50 cents for a cold drink, plus 50 cents for honey.  The food itself is fairly decent. I enjoyed the rice specials - deliciously grilled chicken - but the noodles are a tad overpriced for what they offer. I think their broth is solid, and the laksay is quite tasty, but they also lack options for vegetarians (Lucky Noodle is superior in variety, quantity and quality, while Chef Papa has more variety in drinks).  The decor is nice though, and it's spacious and well-lit.  I come back from time to time in hopes that the magic of its initial opening will come back. Not yet though, not yet."}
{"text":"Been living close by for years and only recently discovered this gem! Ordered the original fish broth with fish tofu and bokchoy. Also added a side dish of fried fish and a hot lemon tea. Hubby ordered the beef broth with beef balls and bokchoy with a side of the chicken teriyaki and a hot lemon tea.  The fish broth was amazing (no msg!) And fish tofu was delish. Portions are huggeee so come hungry! The fried fish fillet was good! Nice crispy coating and not too greasy. Hubby's beef broth was good too (he enjoyed it)..but the teriyaki chicken was underwhelming.  Great place for cold days!"}
{"text":"This is well known for the \"build your noodle\" kind of dining. You just tick off the options you want on the sheet and bam, quick and delicious bowl of noodles just how you want it.   I really like this place for several reasons. Service is pretty quick. Prices are fair. And of course the food is great.   There's a good selection of different noodles you can choose from, as well as soup base. I just want to add the fact that the soup base doesn't taste watered down or filled with MSG like a lot of places. I feel good after eating, versus some other places that make me feel like I'm dying of thirst and shrivelling up from the inside out.   Also! Their bubble tea is really good. I usually get the house special green milk tea with tapioca. Its a nice strong flavorful tea. Its probably one of my favorite bubble teas. They make their tapioca fresh everyday too because if you arrive late in the evening sometimes they sell out of tapioca for the day.   Overall, this is one of my go to places for noodles for dinner. Especially after the gym in the evening. Its 10% off after 9pm (I think, or it might be a little earlier)"}
{"text":"I had the teriyaki pork chop with egg on rice combo with a hot horlicks. This is a misnomer. The pork chop is not teriyaki. It's a cutlet pork chop with a slight amount of teriyaki sauce on top. The egg was over easy, but the yolk was fully cooked. Big portion of food though. Lots of rice at the bottom. Comes with three slices of cucumber and a stir-fried mixture of enoki mushrooms, sliced white mushrooms and onions nestled between the pork chop and the rice. Horlick was tasty. Unlike a lot of other places, they put enough powder in it that the horlicks doesn't need added sugar because it already has plenty of horlicks flavor. It also stayed hot throughout my entire meal.  Sad bit towards the end. They handed us our bill without us asking for it. We hadn't even been there for an hour yet..."}
{"text":"Amazing noodle soups that can be customized to your delight. Make sure you get there early to avoid the long lines.  I arrived with my family before noon and the line starts to be uncontrollable by 12:30 pm. The previous restaurant was similar where they serve noodle soups customized to your hearts content.  Choices to customize your noodle soup include meats, veggies, soup base, noodle type and combo feature to include a drink. I chose the tomato / fish soup base paired with crystal noodle, fish and some veggies. It was delicious and quite large in portion that I needed to bring it home for a second meal. The drink I order was the ginger tea since I was still recovering from my cold.  The extra food items were the Taiwanese sausage and wings. Everyone enjoyed the sausage but the wings were nothing special. I would go back but recommend everyone go early or else stand in line for more than 30 min."}
{"text":"Nice little place for soup noodles. Packed during dinner time. I recommend the tom yum soup base and laksa with beef tendon, tripe, fish fillet, etc. Tomato & pumpkin soup tasted like rotten tomato purée base. The fish soup base smelled & tasted like the cat food I helped my aunt to make 20-30 years ago.(we cooked the dried little silver fishes in boiling water, then chopped the fish to purée and mixed it and soup with the flaked steamed bun, cats loved it!) Beef tongue is delicious, Cold Yuan yang ( mixed coffee & milk tea) is nice too. Chicken wings are nice. French toast was served cold, otherwise should have been delicious too."}
{"text":"Third visit and it is by far one of our favourite noodle shops.  I tried the lakhsa with ramen noodles (super tasty) We even tried some side dishes but they were just ok (deep fried fish and pork ). I got the chocolate Milk tea this time and it was great as well.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!  Worst experience ever at a restaurant. I got charged extra $3 for writing \"tea\" after \"chocolate Milk\" for the free tea you get with the combo.  How ludicrous is it for them to charge me and say it was my mistake.   When I asked about it, I was corrected and told me still pay up.  So if you ever do decide to go, don't write \"tea\" in the slot for TEA!!!?!!"}
{"text":"I always like their original fish noodle soup with fresh fish fillets and corn. Their side dishes are always best to get when you are ordering one of the noodles. The last time I went and just ordered the ox tongue cause I did not want to have the noodles and i ended up getting the same amount or 1 extra slice compared to the side order."}
{"text":"This deer garden is not as packed as the one on highway 7, so already that's #blessed. The waiting time is not long anyway, because it seems to be larger. Dragged the boy to eat here several times because he lives 5 minutes away and didn't even know there was a deer garden here.... *cue JB music* what do you mean?¿?   The service varies here. It's always quick but not always friendly.. one lady that works here is all smiles, all the time while the other one looks like she's never smiled in her entire life. All good, the food comes out fairly quickly. It's weird how the drinks always come AFTER the bowls of deliciousness, when they can be made so much quicker.   The food is consistent with the other chain. My friend loves the fish soup base offered here, while I always head for the laksa. So good and yummy, especially for a cold day. I love the thick rice noodle + corn.. geeeez, I love corn more than I can love a human baby. They never skimp out on the ingredients, and I always get more than I can finish. The prices are high, but that's expected for a noodle bar. Honestly, I don't know if I prefer chef papa more or deer garden. It really doesn't matter to me, it's just whichever one I'm closer to. I'm a noodle head, so I'm always down for it.   + the iced lemon tea is way too sweet.. definitely get it unsweetened or half sweet if you order it unless you want to end up with a sugar migraine."}
{"text":"Probably the only reason I come to Times Square. I am definitely about the noodle life and this is the noodle life on steroids. So delicious!   You can customize your own noodles by picking a soup base (no msg fish soup as advertised) or a spicy one (peanut one is really interesting). You can also choose your meats and veggies plus your noodles! They've got a lot of options actually and it's always interesting to come here and try something new. The prices have gone up though! It used to be around $8 but now it's close to $10 for the combo. However, I do still like to come here for a good treat. Another plus is that I've never had to wait for seats and then shortly after, there's a huge line piling out the door. BLESS MY LUCKY SOUL.   One thing I hate is the parking lot! Plenty of dumb drivers driving cars they don't know how to. I like getting spots right in the front even though it's hard to. There's also underground parking right beside the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Deer garden is great for quick meals that leaves you extremely full without hurting your wallet. They have a menu where you create your own noodle dish by choosing your soup base, two toppings, type of noodles and drink. Extra toppings costs around $1.50 and you can also choose side dishes for $2.50 each. If you do not want to create your own bowl, they have a regular menu for you to choose from as well.   Once you have completed your order, it taste less than 5 min for your dish to arrive to is awesome if you are in a hurry. The portions are very big and even though you were only allowed to choose two toppings, the soup base comes with a variety of vegetables so your dish isn't really that plain."}
{"text":"Nothing is more soothing than a big hot bowl of noodles after a stressful Winter morning   The noodles ordering sheet was pretty straightforward so even though it was my first time here I placed my order with ease. I picked the rice noodles (thick) and got original fish soup base with beef tendon & fish balls ($9.75)  Soup noodles came out really hot so it was nice, but I thought the soup was a little bit fishy at first so I added some white pepper. After drinking a few more sips I started to like the simple flavour of this soup base. The rice noodles was chewy just like the way I like it and other than the two toppings it also came with some napas, mushroom and beancurd sheets  For the drink I got a Iced Yuzu Black Tea, it was really refreshing and I enjoyed sipping on it while being stuck in traffic on the way home. But if I were to order it again next time I will ask them to put less sugar  I will be back to try the other soup base when I am in the area"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of great things so I finally decided to come here and give it a try. We went during lunch on a Saturday and the restaurant was busy but the wait wasn't long at all. I ordered the Peanut Sauce and Chili Soup Paste with Egg Noodles, Sliced Beef, Fish Balls and Beef Tendon. I love how you can customise your own noodles with so many different combinations. This soup base was quite delicious. For appetizers, we also ordered the Deep Fried Pork Chop and it was a good deal for $1.95 with decent portions. For the drink, I ordered the Hong Kong Style Milk Tea. Can't wrong with that when you dine at Asian restaurants. Overall, it was a great dining experience and would definitely go back again and again."}
{"text":"No matter which location you go to for Deer Garden, you gotta love their food here. This location does take reservations for groups of 5 or more and luckily we did because the Richmond Hill location is smaller than the Scarborough and this one is always busy as well. We didn't wait long before getting a seat here. Staff were pretty friendly and the food came out relatively quickly. For $9.75, you pick a a type of chicken or fish base, 2 toppings, the type of noodles and a drink. I have to say, that is pretty good deal for a good meal that gives you a decent amount of food. You also have delicious sides to order which a popular staple here too. I ordered the Peanut and Chili soup base with beef slices and beef balls with the egg noodles, cold HK style tea and the pan fried sausages with honey glaze. Simply delicious and words can't describe how good Deer Garden is so you will have to go and try it out for sure! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Tried this place out on a whim. The unagi bowl was surprisingly good and very filling! Taro milk tea was good as well (not the best but good). Will be coming back again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"So I usually come around 5ish for early dinners and its usually not that busy. Also if you order from their preset menus its $1.00 off from their regular price and it includes one hot drink. This pricing happens from 3-6 pm and 9 pm onwards. The portions are quite filling especially their rice bowls. I also love their laksha soup noodles with their pork cutlet. I ordered their hot chocolate as my drink which I think is a good deal because usually in normal asian cafes hot chocolate is extra money. The cold speciality drinks are also yummy."}
{"text":"Their huge bowl of Laksa noodles has been the recent remedy to my noodle obsession. Creamy coconut Malay flavours with a great spicy kick - keeps me coming back for more! I've tried the other soup base options such as Sichuan spicy soup (too salty) and tomato pumpkin fish soup (healthy but bland) and the laksa is definitely the winner.   The main differentiating factor at deer garden is being able to customize everything from a wide selection of soup base, toppings and noodle type. So if you choose to, you can customize the @@ out of your noodles to find your perfect match :)   Recommend - Fish tofu: square shaped with a silky yet firm texture, this is highly addictive  - Pumpkin slices: love pumpkin! I think having pumpkin in the soup makes the consistency even more dewy and rich  - Veggies: tons of hearty veggie options - I like the seaweed, cabbage and mushrooms - Korean glass noodles: Made out of sweet potato starch, this clear noodle has a sort of tapioca chewy texture that is delicious and apparently healthy - Ox tongue: there are extra side order items for $2.25 and the pan seared ox tongue was surprisingly good  $9.50 for a giant bowl of noodles + a drink is pretty cheap although if you want more than 2 toppings it's additional charge of $1.50 each (not too bad of a splurge for extra deliciousness)."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night for dinner around 8.00pm. Had to wait about 15 minutes for a table of 2. I heard good things and hype about this place so decided to give it a try  The noodle bowls has increased a dollar to $9.25 with a choice of broth, noodles and 2 toppings and a simple hong kong style drink. Being able to customize your noodles is probably the best part, which is check off boxes in their menu sheets given on the table.   I got the Szechwan spicy broth - I like spicy foods but this was really spicy - unfortunately it was just one noted there was no depth or other flavours in the broth kinda felt like bland chicken broth with a ton of chili oil dumped in. The clear sweet potato noodles were good and large portioned. I got the beef brisket which also came in a good portion, and I got about 4 pieces of fish tofu.   The chili peanut broth was also lacking in flavour and depth - it was supposed to be like dan dan noodles but it was lacking that peanut richness. The thick rice noodles were good. The portion of sliced beef was a bit small and also came with 4 pieces of fish balls.   Drinks were the usual regular thing, the service was ok just as you expect a place like this to be quite rushed when being served. Although there was no one at the door when I walked in, had to walk to the back counter and had to wait a while to be given a waiting number. I'd like to come back though to try their more regular fish broths."}
{"text":"This place is excellent.  You get to customize your noodles and soup base.  We ordered the laksa noodle and fish soup noodle.  On the side, we ordered the turnip cake and chicken wings.  The turnip cake is not your regular congee queen style.  The pieces are massive and flavourful.  I would come to this place again.  Milk tea is great too!  Tip:  you can also order just the fish base soup to go, a large container for only $4.  Great for making homemade soup noodles, vegetables and dumplings."}
{"text":"This place seems to be doing well been here twice during dinner on weekend and people are usually waiting for a table sign says won't seat anyone until whole party has arrived anyways don't expect service to be great I had noodles both time it's kind of like hot pot can choose soup base toppings and noodle I'm not to crazy about the soup base and noodle nothing special maybe the rice is better have to try that next time"}
{"text":"Deer Garden is very well-known in Vancouver and they decided to expand to Toronto a year ago.  I already came to this place a few times and they are always busy during lunch and dinning hours!  Unless you are willing to wait, I would recommend going somewhere else or come during non-peak hours as the waiting area is kind of small.  I must warn everything that this place has close to ZERO customer service which is not that surprising from a Chinese owned restaurant!  If you are a BIG fan of customer service, then please step out of the door now.  Their #1 selling item on the menu is the fish soup noodle.  Indicating it contains no MSG really makes a lot of people happy nowadays.  As a beginner with fish soup, I would recommend just playing it safe by either selecting Original Fish Soup or GIngko and pepper fish soup as your soup base, which both have strong fish soup flavour with the latter for the spicy lover.  For noodles, I would recommend the Rice Noodle (Thick) or Flat rice noodle.  For toppings, since you are only allow to choose two without additional cost, my recommendation is to choose two toppings between fish filet, fish puffs, fish tofu and cuttlefish slice.  Drinks can be whatever preference you want and if you also want side orders, feel free.  Just a note, you can ask for no cabbage or other standard toppings that comes with the soup.  For a noodle soup with 2 toppings and a hot drink for $8.95+tax is a little expensive for noodle soup.  If you want a less MSG meal and want to try some fish soup noodle soup in Markham/Richmond Hill area, I would recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 3.5 stars, because this place is above average, however, it's nothing incredibly special in comparison to other places.  I shared a big bowl of noodles with my friend, and got two side dishes, which amounted to around $11, which is pretty solid considering that the two of us were stuffed. It was alright, it satisfied our hunger, but it wasn't anything note-worthy.  All in all, it's a good place for a quick bite to eat!  I also recommend the honey green tea! A+/"}
{"text":"Still another 5 stars, love this place - always good quality and delicious for a bargain. Tip: if it is busy I recommend grabbing a menu and ordering first :) their bubble tea with no sugar is not bad either !"}
{"text":"Deer garden is my regular restaurant that I go to. Their noodles are very good, iced tea is very good as well. The best thing is that you can get bubble tea there, which is fantastic. You get to order your food just by checking the options you want on the paper. The food always arrives fast. They also make sure you are full after the bowl of noodles. Every-time you go there, and come out, you will feel contented. A must go, must try, and must give a five star!"}
{"text":"Deer Garden has two stores, one in Scarborough close to pacific mall, one is at this Richmond hill location. Food is fabulous in both location. I just happen to like the soup at this Richmond hill location better. I would recommend this place to everyone who likes noodles with soup and side dishes are awesome too. Price is not cheap, but it definitely makes you feel satisfied after you finish eating here.   Enjoy guys and keep up the good work Deer Garden!"}
{"text":"This is another one of my favourite noodle restaurants for lunch on a weekday or on the weekend with the family.  You choose your soup base, noodles, ingredients, drinks and an optional side dish.  $9.75 + $2.25 for the side dish.  One of my go-to choices is the Laksa soup with Egg Noodles, Beef Brisket and Fish Tofu.  I pair that with a Hot Milk Tea/Coffee or a Cold Lemon Ribena drink (mixed with Club Soda -- a winning thirst-quenching combo).  For my side, I usually go with the deep fried chicken wings (that have a nice crispy skin and hint of ginger) or the deep fried fish filet (also tasty).  It's a big bowl of noodles and the service is quick.  You will be satisfied and keep coming back for more."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I haven't had many laksa soup bases before so I'm not how accurate my tastes are in this area. That being said, I loved the laksa soup here because of its creaminess and flavor. It's not that spicy despite the colour. I don't like rice noodle so I think I'd rather eat with instant noodles (which seems like a waste for a lot of people). But I think the soup base is worth it!  Husband got the dan dan soup which was also pretty good in flavour but texture was too thick."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my family, and the restaurant was packed. Wait time was lengthy, but at least it gave us plenty of time to study the menu. I really liked the layout of their noodle soup ordering sheets! The instructions were very clear and concise. There was a good amount of choices available for the soup bases, toppings, and noodles.. a lot of ways to really customize your order. I ended up going with the Malay laksa soup, sliced beef brisket, fish tofu, and rice noodles with no scallions. The menu also had 8 side orders available, and we ordered about 5 different ones to share.  3 of the side orders arrived way before our bowls of noodle soup, but I didn't really care because I was so hungry. The pan fried pork chop in maggi sauce wasn't great. The texture of the meat was a little strange, and I remember thinking they might've used low quality meat. The deep fried pork chop was only okay. It had a nice deep fried crisp on the outside, but the inside was pretty dry in certain spots. It seemed a little bit overcooked in general. The pan fried sausage slices with honey glaze was very tasty and probably my favorite side order that I tried.   My bowl of noodle soup eventually arrived and wow, it was gigantic. The Malay laksa soup was very rich and flavorful with just the right amount of spice. I would've finished the whole bowl of soup if my stomach didn't already feel like it was going to explode at the end of the meal. The beef brisket was really good too. It was very tender, and it had the perfect amount of fat. The fish tofu was about what I expected, so I was content with its flavor. The rice noodles were very good, and I was glad that they retained the same texture throughout the meal.. I find it a little annoying when noodles absorb too much soup overtime.   The last two side orders arrived when I was about halfway through my noodle soup. The pan fried boneless chicken in teriyaki sauce was nothing special, and I've definitely had much better. The desert wings with ginger had an excellent texture, but I found myself very underwhelmed with the flavor. I couldn't really taste any ginger at all, and it just seemed like normal fried chicken wings to me.  Overall, the service was a little bit on the slow side, but I imagine that's because the place was so packed. The price for the noodle soup was totally worth it, but I'm not sure if I would be willing to pay that much for the side orders again (because of the small portion sizes and/or flavors). If I come here again in the future, I'm probably going to stick with the noodle soup by itself because one order of that is both massive and delicious. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"?????????????????lunch time?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Period. The service is so poor. The food is bland.  They put me at a table at the very end. It took me 15 mins to get someone to take my slip for food. I guess they thought I was takeout even though I told them I was eating in. Then they left my food sitting out for 15 mins so it was cold and mushy when it arrived and forgot my drink.  If you like guilin style noodles don't go here. Go to tsui wah or yogi noodles instead.  BTW no one cares here if you are not happy so don't bother to complain. Just don't ever come back here"}
{"text":"Upgrading my rating on this establishment to 3. Tried alternate broth this time - Ginger and pepper fish soup. It's definitely a marked improvement over the original broth which was bland. The soup has stronger kick without being overwhelming.   One important tips when visiting this establishment: Don't overwhelm your soup with toppings. Two toppings are sufficient and preferably either the fish puff and fish fillet that way the broth and the fish works together (instead of having fish soup mixed with beef).  Overall an OK place to have quick in and out dinner."}
{"text":"Big portions and good prices. I think this restaurant is mainly known for its soup noodles + customized noodle bowls. To order, you just take one of the white sheets, and fill in the blanks. When you customized noodle combos comes with a free drink (options found on the menu). There is an option for non-MSG soup bases.  I've tried the peanut soup base (super heavy and filling) and the malay laksa soup base. Both are really good if you're looking for a creamy and savory soup base. Note that these can get pretty salty/MSG-y throughout the meal. For drinks, I recommend the milk tea or the almond tea.   Make sure to ask for the noodles and soup separate because these portions are BIG! For $12.50, you can pretty much get two meals out of it. Or you could share one bowl with another person too."}
{"text":"After doing some research there are two locations, one in Richmond Hill and the other in Scarborough. I figured I'd give the one close to home a try. Located on Silver Star Blvd the plaza can be quite a challenge to find parking during peak dinner hours. Nonetheless once inside the interior is bustling with patrons seated in a modern and contemporary setting. Their choice of foods are diverse whether it be rice, noodles or soups. Both J and I decided to try their popular noodle: $9.75 you choose your type of soup, noodles, 2 toppings a d choice of hot or cold drink. I opted for their Thai Tom yong soup, Korean sweet noodles, sliced beef and tofu , hot tea.  The portions were so sufficient I couldn't finish it.  On the side we ordered their fried turnip cakes, big chunks, slightly crisp on the outside, nice and soft inside...either way it was delish. HK tea was okay, perhaps as a recommendation they could have added more milk."}
{"text":"I love noodle soup, and Deer Garden does it well. Pretty much all their soupbases are good but my favourite is their laksa soupbase!"}
{"text":"Deer Garden is one of the originals that created, pick your own soup, noodles and toppings..love customizing my own without having to consult others...Lol...   The classic soup base is probably the fish soup base which is milky and light, not overloaded with salt  (+1star) onto choosing toppings, for $9.75, it includes 2 toppings which is ok, you can always add more choices by adding $1.75. Keep in mind tho, there are quite a bit of side toppings already included without extra $$, (+0.5 star)  You can get a drink from the menu for an extra $2 or if you want bubble tea...it's more...additonal to the side of your noodles, you can choose from the list of 6-7 items for $2.25...like 3 pieces of spicy chicken wings or cutlet pork chops, which is a nice addition to your big bowl of noodles...(+0.5 star)  They are always sooo busy, and line forms during busy dinner hours...  All in all, a place I'm coming back over and over again without hesitation!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating here. I almost always order rice noodle in the pumpkin tomato soup with fish filet and beef brisket. Ask for \"XO Sauce\" which is served in a tiny disposable cup. It adds a kick of flavour and spice to the more subtle dishes. The side dishes are already great, particularly the cow tongue. My second favourite combination would be the malay laksa soup with sweet potato glass noodles. The price includes a free basic hot drink, such as ovaltine, or you can pay a bit more to upgrade to a cold drink or event bubble tea.  There is plenty of free parking in this plaza."}
{"text":"I really love the food here. But I'm very disappointed at the service I received today. I came to have lunch alone. Without asking me, they seated another customer right in front of me to share the table with me. I don't mind sharing a table with others if we are beside each other, cause there is usually enough space in between. But there's not enough personal space when the other person is right in front of you.  I was sharing the table with a lady. There was something in her throat and she kept trying to cough it out. It made me very uncomfortable and I couldn't eat my noodles at all. When the lady asked for her bill, they put both of our meals on the same bill. The lady told the waitress it was the wrong bill because she only ordered one combo. The waitress looked at us and said but you guys ordered two meals. I had to tell her I didn't even know the other person. She was shocked at this arrangement too. Well I assume anyone would be. I ended up leaving with my noodles barely touched."}
{"text":"This place is generally good, by that, I mean you can't really go wrong. The noodles are standard with a lot of options for soup bases and different types of noodles. There are a bunch of toppings, appetizers, and drinks to choose from. This place has really good variety and the price is also pretty decent.  Tastewise, it's basically the same as the other location but with less people. Also more accessible for people in the Scarborough area that don't have a car.   Verdict: Try it. It's not pricey, it's pretty good, and you'll be full.  That's all."}
{"text":"Finally there is a great Chinese noodle place. Great soup base and noodle choices. No MSG. Side dishes are pretty decent too. This isn't those cheap $5 noodle places."}
{"text":"Everything there was pretty much perfect except for the long wait for a table - there wasn't much of a waiting area so it was a bit crammed.    First thing I've noticed when we stepped in was the smell of fish, wasn't great at first, but then I got use to it.  AC was on full blast!  Perfect for taking in hot noodle soup and the amazing XO sauce.  The hostesses were efficient, food came out quickly, soup was so good I finished it all.  I was very satisfied after the meal.  I would definitely return.  I think this location is better than the one in Richmond Hill IMO."}
{"text":"I've been to the one in Vancouver and I'm glad they've opened one here.  The soup is great!  Piping hot and not too fishy.  They weren't skimpy on toppings either.  We were full just having a bowl of noodles without any sides.  My only complaint is that service is quite slow.  We've waited at good 20 mins or so before we got our food."}
{"text":"I came here with my dad today for lunch and it was super easy for us to grab a table. The menus that are given are somewhat confusing to read, especially the make-your-own noodle combo. But other than that, we ordered and got our meals within 15 minutes  I chose to make my own soup, while my dad went for one of the premade bowls (don't remember the name of the dish, but it was #511!). I chose the laksa soup with instant noodle, fish balls, beef brisket and a side of lemon tea  The laksa soup was the right amount of spicy and it had so much flavor! My dad definitely preferred my bowl over his. His bowl was a lot lighter in taste, so if you're looking for something savory and flavorful I don't recommend getting #511. My dad commented on how tough the beef pieces were in my bowl, saying they were too thick.   I really liked my meal here and the service was pleasant. I would like to come back here again for more laksa soup!"}
{"text":"There's not much to say that other yelpers haven't. Our go-to soup noodle restaurant that's consistent with portioning and quality.   My girlfriend will judge me for this short and non-descriptive review because it's her favourite place, especially in the cold months.   They specialize in soup noodles and their ordering card makes it easy to get what you want. From century egg and parsley to laksa soup base, they're all flavourful and filling. For $10 you get a huge bowl of noodles and a hot HK style drink (coffee, tea, ovaltine, etc.)  They don't just have soup noodles. Other than the few sides they have on their order card they have a full menu from the wok (I assume they stir fry with a wok)."}
{"text":"This casual restaurant offers super fast service for cheap. To order, you fill in a form selecting your soup base, type of noodle, toppings, and any add-ons. There is a wide variety to choose from, such as imitation crab meat, fish balls, beef, corn, and greens.  So far, I've tried Deer Garden's laksa soup base and chicken broth soup base. The laksa is heavier, while the chicken broth is lighter, but both were delicious. I also love how their noodle dishes are served piping hot! The portions are also massive, so it's worth the price paid.  The restaurant's noodle dishes also come with a drink of choice; I always opt for the classic Hong Kong style milk tea.  This is a great place for a fast lunch or dinner, and the place is also quite clean. They don't accept credit card yet, but diners can pay with debit or cash. I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Good, consistent food at a decent price.   I'm a fan of the healthier choices (# beside soups with no MSG), but occasionally venture over to the other side of the menu for a soup with more flavour. The orders always come out quickly.  The restaurant can be quite loud with children, large groups and servers balancing large trays trying to get past. But the dining area is clean and atmosphere warm.   A nice place to take your family for lunch on  the weekend."}
{"text":"Always packed during lunch hours. Their noodle combo is good, but the portion is too big. I always couldn't finish noodle."}
{"text":"We called around 1pm today, just to see if they have a  table for 9 people. The hostess on the phone said they did when I called and I just needed to get there right after the call. I told her it will take us 10 minutes to get there. I got there within the time she requested only to find the restaurant completely full.   The other hostess shifted the blame on her colleague and claimed that the hostess must have told me to wait.   I told her to get me the hostess or manager because they pretty much just tricked 9 Of us to times square for nothing.   Please, do not tell us there is actually space when there isn't!"}
{"text":"Make your own noodle bowl Shop!  For 9.95 choose soup base, 2 toppings, noodle, and drink.  A short time later, your creation is on your plate. Yum. This place is perfect for the picky eater because they get to choose what to eat. Also, it is a busy place. Be prepared to wait if you are coming at a prime time. Also, they have a wide assortment of drinks. Everything from bubble tea to plain coffee. Hot and cold! This place easily became my wife's favorite place to get pho, but it isn't really pho. This place is more for that fish stock. I usually don't like fish stock, but this place does it pretty well.  It has fish, pork, beef, chicken, and veggies. I do wish there were a bit more options for toppings though.   Not interested in a noodle bowl? No problem, they have all day specials with some American and Chinese food as well.   Definitely a good place to have some good food."}
{"text":"Consistently good soup noodles. The broth is always piping hot! On my latest visit, I tried the Gingko and White Pepper - very strong pepper taste, spicy. For toppings, I got fish and pumpkin; the mushroom pork ball and tofu fish puffs are good as well.   And my new fav drink is the Hot Lemon Ribena!"}
{"text":"A piping hot bowl of fish noodles is perfect for a cold night! I came here on Wednesday around 10pm.  For $8.25: Choice of broth (many choices!), noodle, 2 toppings, and a drink. I like that they indicate which have no MSG and there really is a lot of variety to choose from.   I ordered original fish broth with thick rice noodles, green veggie (choi sum) and fish fillet (actual fish, not fish ball/paste). The bowl itself already comes with napa cabbage, dried bean curd and some mushroom. The soup is fairly light and milky. I like that it's definitely hot enough and a very large portion, but it could be stronger in fish taste and a bit thicker.  The HK style milk tea needs major improvement. It tastes like it has no cream at all and couldn't be saved with two packs of sugar.   My boyfriend ordered from the late night special menu which has a lot of appealing rice and noodle options. He got the Spicy Beef & Enoki Mushroom Vermicelli. It definitely is spicy!! Pretty good."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and attentive wait staff. No MSG selections are awesome! I don't get thirsty afterwards so there really is no MSG (or very very very very little) for the no MSG selections. Their side dishes are surprisingly good (fried fish fillet) and overall great experience. Always busy so that should mean something. Will go back as I usually do."}
{"text":"I think this place has been here for a couple years at least. I remember when it first opened, it seems like one of the first to do the build your own noodles options. That was fairly interesting as you combinations are endless.   The prices have raised a little over the years but you're still looking at under $10 before tax and tips, which is decent. That includes a hot drink.  The variety is what's important here. The quality is 7.5/10 at best. Portions are great. I think it's a good concept as there are other restaurants that also do this now. Would recommend it if you're not sure what noodles to get and want to build your own!"}
{"text":"Delicious food is subjective to a person's taste and preference. However, when presented with a steaming hot, bowl of spicy noodle soup, no man can deny such food greatness.   Ending my strenuous day at work, I ventured around Richmond Hill for a delicious takeout dinner. Heeding my mom's advice, I drove towards Deer Garden with an empty stomach and eagerness to satisfy my hunger. I ordered a Tom Yum Ho Fun Noodle Soup with sliced Beef, Beef Balls, and chopped Lettuce. For the purposes of the review, I also ordered the thick noodles, with the same ingredients of the first. I additionally purchased chicken wings as a side dish. After watching my neatly packed takeout boxes arrive, I left and journeyed towards home.  Arriving at home, I unpackaged the boxes and poured the hearty goodness in a bowl. I decided to try the ho fun noodles first. Equipped with a pair of wooden chopsticks and a plastic soup spoon, I began eating. The first bite warmed my mouth, of spices from the soup and noodles of perfect texture.  The chopped lettuce complimented well with the noodles and absorbed the delicious flavor from the soup. However, the beef balls and sliced beef was average.   Finishing the ho fun noodles, I poured my thick noodles along with the soup/other ingredients into a separate bowl.  The thick noodles contained a nice texture and complimented deliciously with the soup/other ingredients.   Along the side, the chicken wings served nicely with the spicy Tom Yum soup. The fried chicken absorbed the flavor of the soup. The texture maintained a consistent crispiness. Despite my praise, the flavor of the chicken itself was bland, which lacked seasoning.   Deer Garden satisfied my hunger with food greatness and flaws. The Tom Yum soup was brewed beautifully, maintaining a consistent spicy flavor. The noodles (both ho fun and thick noodles) had perfect texture and mixed well with the soup. However the chicken wings and sliced beef/beef balls were a disappointment. Nonetheless, Deer Garden defined a great noodle soup restaurant. If you desire a great dinner with friends or family (perhaps yourself, no embarrassment), sally forth towards Deer Garden.  P.S If you stumble upon a grammatical error, and/or awkward/unclear sentences, please message Rao."}
{"text":"Good value comfort food.  If you like spicy soupy food, the spicy fish soup is a must try."}
{"text":"Deer Garden is best known for their noodle dishes. The best part is you can choose what you want in your bowl. They give you a paper menu that you check off to include your options. You have the choice of soup broth, choice of type of noodles, and choice of 2 ingredients with a select hot beverage all for $9.75. It used to be $8.75, but I guess when when demand is high they can raise the price.   I've been here twice and both experiences were good, and more importantly you get a decent sized bowl of noodles. The place was pretty busy for lunch on a Wednesday. There was a small wait which surprised me, but that gave us enough time to choose what we wanted to eat. This place is one of the few of my top noodle places in Richmond Hill. JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"So, this joint was originally a Vancouver chain - odd, because I've actually never heard of this place until I moved to Toronto.  This place doesn't do anything horribly wrong - it's perfectly acceptable and middle of the road.  But therein lies the greatest sin (in my opinion) in food: it's perfectly average and mediocre.  It's boring.  Food should elicit a strong feeling either way.  I can respect a restaurant/dish in failing spectacularly -- I will hate it and one-star it -- but still respect it.  The first problem is the customize it yourself soup noodle system.  I dislike the whole concept along with similar ideas like hot pot and pick-your-ingredients-and-we-grill-it restaurants.  I cook myself when I want to be anal about what I'm eating.  I eat out when I'm too lazy to make decisions or I trust the expertise of the chef.  I hate the whole Burger King 'have it your way' mentality.  I can understand some customization - but I don't need 12 soup choices, 8 noodle options and 20 topping selections making for hundreds of possible variants. I don't need to micro-manage every minutiae of a dish. Yes - I know some people like this, but it's not for me.  Seriously - when I come to power, every restaurant will be limited to 8 menu items - just do what you do best -- HK cafes get a pass because your benevolent leader has a nostalgic softspot for them.  I picked pepper and gingko fish soup, flat noodles, topped with fish balls and sliced beef brisket.  It was alright - nothing great or bad.  Some of the add-ons are good value though - added $2 for a good sized fried fish filet and $2 for a smallish dish of fish puffs.  I will note that all the soup choices are either have a chicken or pork stock element - so not a good option for you vegetarians/vegans."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant on a Saturday at around 12pm.  The parking lot is busy, and it took us a while to find a spot. There was already a decent line up when we entered the restaurant, around 5 tables in front of us.  The restaurant is spacious and well ventilated. We were seated (after a bit of confusion as the waitress never really acknowledged us after they called our number). For the 8.75 combo, you pick your own toppings and fill out the order form. It's a pretty good deal, considering you get a hot drink with your meal and the portions are generous (+ $1 for cold drinks). The cold HK milk tea I ordered was delicious and came in a sealed bubble tea cup, great for taking it with me after.  The noodles come with shredded cabbage, sliced mushrooms, and bean curd, in addition to the two toppings that you choose. We also ordered a side dish of chicken wings for 1.99 (3 pieces). It was deep fried to a nice golden colour. The noodles came in a steaming bowl of soup - when I say steaming, I mean it! The laksa I ordered was well flavored and egg noodles were not overcooked.   Pretty good place for lunch, I'd be happy to come back, just for the food!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty neat if you've never been. You basically design your own soup noodles, choosing from a variety of different soup bases, noodles and toppings.  I ordered a lak as soup base noodles with imitation crab meat cause I like imitation crab and thought they would go well together. Soup was tasty and the noodles were filling. It was very satisfying on the cold night that I had it. It also came with a drink. I ordered a cold milk tea which was good but a little sweet."}
{"text":"This place is always packed, however, I love to come here for a lunch or even a dinner.  No MSG is the main reason.  Pick your own ingredients and nice side dishes are the 2nd reason.  Price is very very reasonable is the 3rd reason!  Love the fish broth, the regular fish broth!  The portion is a bit too much for me, but it's prefect portion for most of my guy-friends."}
{"text":"The service is horrible, server is rude. Does not listen carefully. Their menu says to specify based on allergies and refused to comply when mentioned. They made an error on an order, instead of replacing the whole dish, they tried to make the broth less spice as we asked by adding more broth to the portion (which did not work by the way), while trying to fix our problem, the server kept rolling her eyes and giving attitude the entire time. Just horrendous."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place lately and finally came here to give it a try.  Came here around 2:30 today for a late lunch and it was packed!!  Everyone who was waiting in line had an order sheet on hand and was deciding what to eat already.  The wait was just ten minutes and it wasn't that bad tho.  I had the noodle combo with tomato pumpkin soup base and with two toppings; beef tendon and pork liver.  The soup was good but what I wanted to write about this place is........... their side order.  Every combo can order two sides for $1.75 each.  We had chicken wings and ox tongue.  The ox tongue came first.  There were two round pieces and on a small white plate without ANY presentation.  It looked worse than the Korean banchan......... hmmm...... and I started wondering why this place was THIS packed!!  I grabbed my chopsticks and picked up that ox tongue...... putting it between my teeth and gave it a bite.... OMG....... it was juicy and tender!!   Most restaurants cut the ox tongue in thin slices but this was THICK!!    I have to give  5 stars for my fave cooked to perfection.  Chicken wings were hot and crispy.  Service was ok.  The server who took our order was kind of rude, but the one who gave us the bill was nice.  Service 3 stars.  I'll give it a 4 overall. ** Ask for their homemade chili sauce...... it's so gooooood!! ** ***Cash only! ***"}
{"text":"Always love comfort Chinese food.  Fish noodle soup is always healthy and you can choose your own toppings, soup base & noodle style.  Under $10 for a drink & noodle combo.  Ask for xo sauce if you like spicy.  Cash only for now!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Very good price and great selection of soup bases! The price includes a drink and they serve them in a take out cup which makes it so convenient. Their fish soup base is worth trying, very tasty and not 'fishy'. I also like that they have a bar type table for people who goes there to eat by themselves."}
{"text":"Long story short, Deer Garden's menu offers noodles, rice bowls and a few appetizers.  This is regardless it is a \"signature\" store or not.  Maybe the grand name means the store is bigger and better renovated, but the food remains average.  We ordered a teriyaki eel rice bowl ($9.75) and a bowl soup rice with fish fillet, pork liver and century egg ($7.95).  The teriyaki rice was moist, and the teriyaki eel was big.  It was quite sweet.  My boyfriend needed to sprinkle salt on.  The soup rice tasted fine and there was lot of rice.  There was not enough protein (fish fillets, pork liver).  The century egg was symbolic; it didn't impact the flavour of the dish at all."}
{"text":"Great place for customized soup noodles! Great options for the noodles, toppings and soup base. For soup base I usually like the Malaysian Laksa, peanut sauce and chili, or simple fish broth. Noodles are pretty standard depending on your preference. And I usually go for the beef brisket and tendon since veggies come standard with all bowls."}
{"text":"Good value, decent quality food. I like how a drink is included in your meal and there's good variety of toppings available. Service isn't the greatest though but that's expected at most Asian places."}
{"text":"We were just there yesterday and it didn't disappoint.  We've been here many times.  Portions are good with lots of noodles, meat and veggies.  Service is quick and the soups come out piping hot.  The sides come out timely as well.  We love the chicken wings!  My husband's favourite is the laksa while I enjoy the pumpkin with tomato fish soup as I can share with my toddler and it has lots of vegetables.    I enjoy the hot almond milk while my husband always gets the cold Hk milk tea.    Service is quick but if you come during peak times, be prepare to wait.  The one star less is because we sometimes go to a similar spot elsewhere that is cheaper... But deer garden is bolder in taste."}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times and because their main selling point (I would say) is that they have soup base that has no MSG in it! Wow - it takes really good and I generally like their original fish soup with noodles.   The style works in a \"Step 1-2-3\" process where you order your noodles, pick out your meats, select a drink, and any side orders if you choose to.  Very delicious and usually it does get quite busy. As per like the other photos already posted, everything is quite similar as it is so not much variations.   Hot drinks I order the hk style milk tea which is generally my go-to drink in Chinese places anyways. This is a nice place you'd have for an easy and quick lunch. I never came for dinner before however."}
{"text":"This is like one of my favorite restaurants around this region. I love the fact that it's really inexpensive, has large portions, and a great atmosphere.  Environment: The restaurant is located at the exterior corner of the Times Square plaza, but  to find parking it is better to go inside the plaza. There's lots of space. The restaurant itself is modern, nicely removed. It is a casual dine out. The seats are like those of HK style restaurant, so it's better to come in a small group of 4 or less. Larger groups would need to merge tables in a long row.   Food: I usually order their house special, which is you build your own order from selecting the soup base, the toppings, the noodle type, and the drink. It's only $9.99, comes in a gigantic bowl, and comes with a hot complimentary drink on the side. Bubbles teas are around $2-3 extra but they do come in large size and in take out container cups.  I really recommend their peanut soup base, the favor is amazing and you can really taste the peanuts. If you don't like parsley and green onions you can elect to have those removed. All of the soup bases also comes with tofu skin and bok choi, and those can also be removed by checking a box. I like that the menu is nicely translated so I can bring my English speaking friends with me to this restaurant.  Service: I mean you shouldn't really expect superb service at a casual Chinese restaurant. I always find them to be under staffed. The waiters are also busy, so make sure you wave you hand high so they can notice you."}
{"text":"Came here last night to satisfy my noodle craving and needless to say it has been satisfied.  I got the Parsley and Century Egg soup noodles.  The noodles were chewy as expected, and the pig stomach, and fish in the soup were delicious.  I've also tried the laksa noodles before and that was even better.  However, the spiciness of the laksa tends to vary a lot.  When it's mild I am able to enjoy it and am extremely satisfied, but sometimes it can get too spicy where I'm just trying to get more water to continue eating.  So if you can handle the heat definitely go for the Laksa soup."}
{"text":"Huge portions for 9.75. You get to choose your own soup base, noodles and toppings on top of that a few side dishes. The food was decent, no where near the best I've had. Great place to get full with friends but don't expect anything great."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on the weekend, this place was packed! The wait wasn't that long though. It costs $11.50 for the soup noodle combo. You choose your own soup base & noodles, then pick 2 toppings and a hot drink. If you want cold drinks, you need to pay extra. I usually order the original Fish Soup Noodle with Udon, Bok Choy & King Mushrooms and Hot Milk Tea. The broth has no Msg so you are able to drink the soup; this place is good if you want a light healthy meal!"}
{"text":"Good soup noodles, but watch out for long wait times  + Soup noodles are good (I recommend the tomato + pumpkin soup base) + Portions is filling + Service is relatively fast -  Be prepared to wait a while for lunch on weekends   If you stick with just soup noodles and 2 toppings the price is reasonable.  However adding more toppings and side dishes and the price will add up."}
{"text":"Great place for a hot bowl of noodles on a cold chilly day.  Malay laksa is their most (in my opinion), pungent and flavorful broth.  They have a paper sheet you fill in to select your broth, 2 toppings, a drink, side dishes and noodles.  Pretty filling and tasty. Their cold bubble tea drinks are quite large, so if you have a bit of a sweet tooth this place is great  Don't need to say would come back again, as I'm already a regular"}
{"text":"We came here because we want to grab a quick dinner after work.  This restaurant at this location is relatively new and decoration is decent and spacious.  We ordered 2 bowl of noodles and 2 drink as a combo.  They allow you to customize the noodle, soup, ingredients.  We end up with beef brisket and fish fillet.  One bowo with fish soup and one with tomato pumpkin.  Both broth are good and the portion is huge.  Definitely worth the money and walk out belly full.  For the drinks, we ordered hk style hot milk tea and hot Lemon Ribena.  The hk style milk tea is as usual good but I was surprised with Someone Ribena.  It taste very refreshing.  Worth trying it out if you get a chance.  For the price, taste and portion of food, I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"my sister is a big fan of the noodles here as they do have some soup options with no MSG.   the way the system works is that it is a combo:  - soup base option (no MSG fish soup or Chicken soup base) - two toppings are included with additional toppings at $1.75 each - types of noodles - 1 hot drink is included but other options have an additional charge  Then you also have an option of adding side items.  I had ordered the parsley and century egg fish soup with fish filet, fish tofu, cabbage and flat rice noodles. Not sure if it is due to the type of noodles i had picked but i found it a little lacky in flavour.  Otherwise, it wasn't bad, pretty big portions. I would also upgrade to a cold drink next time since the hot lemon tea that i had gotten wasn't really that great."}
{"text":"Soup base + toppings + noodles + drink = $9.75.   I ordered the spicy Szechuan soup base, udon noodle, enoki mushroom and fish fillet with ovaltine drink for $9.75.  It comes with two toppings, each additional topping is $1.75.  It comes with a warm drink, if you want a cold drink it's $0.50 more.    The food I ordered was yummmmy!  The Szechuan soup base I got had the perfect spice level.  The noodle that they provided was just right (my meal was not drowned in noodles) with large amount of cabbage, cilantro and mushroom (that was not charged as additional toppings).   Definitely would consider coming back again."}
{"text":"Great place to eat in Richmond Hill. I've been here for lunch and dinner and both times the service (albeit rushed.. they are efficient!!) and food have been great.   We went for the signature $8.75 noodles which comes with 2 toppings for your noodles and a drink. Sides are available for around $2.75 each. The amount of toppings you get in the soup noodle is overwhelming! I can barely finish a bowl myself because there is so much! You will be stuffed , guaranteed. I've had all the soup bases and all the noodles and my favourite combo is the tom yum soup with sweet potato noodles (I don't like the carby noodles) or fish soup with sweet potato noodles (the sweet potato noodles just suck up all the fish flavour!  We always get the fried pork chop and desert chicken wings for the sides. The chicken wings are DELICIOUS and perfectly crispy  For those who don't want noodles, other dishes are also available."}
{"text":"I was not expecting much from all the 3 star reviews but I really did enjoy the food.  Our table order three different noodles. The combination I went with was the following: Laksa soup base, thick rice noodle, beef with pig intestines for my two toppings and a hot HK style milk tea - all for $8.75. I really liked the soup and the texture of the noodles. There were large portions of the meat toppings and the pig intestines were really yummy.   Also got the french toast at $4.75 which included another milk tea. This is not your typical french toast which can be made at home. Between the bread there is peanut butter and battered with egg and finally deep fried to golden perfection. Honey was included as a dipping sauce. Tasted awesome and I wish I didn't have to share it. Next time I'm ordering one just for myself :)  For one of the noodle combinations you can add a red bean drink for $2 which was as good as the everything else I ate. Cool and refreshing after a hot bowl of noodles.  Overall a very satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Big fan of Deer Garden because you can pretty much pick whatever you want in your noodle soup. Unlike what some ppl commented, not all of their soup broth is MSG free - (it actually specifies on the selection sheet which ones are MSG free), the more flavourful ones (laksa, tom yum, etc.) do contain MSG. Also, their XO sauce is very delicious but it is not limited to just one per customer like some people commented. My personal favourite broth are the chao chou (fish based) and the tom yum. Laksa is also delicious! $10.75 a combo includes choice of soup broth, 2 toppings, choice of noodles and a warm drink. Cold drinks and some other warm drinks are available at an additional charge. Takeout orders don't come with a drink but you can add a small fee for it. Also, you get 10% off on take out orders of over $20."}
{"text":"i really like this place! but it's not very budget friendly since you can easily run up to over $10 a person.. and i guess it's kinda worth it considering the portion you are getting. the fish soup is very delicious! ox tongues were great as well! and the hk style milk tea is sooo good!"}
{"text":"The recipe for a bowl of these fish broth soup is simple: noodles, fresh fish broth, fresh ingredients and hopefully a bit of zing.  That zing, especially in a fish broth place, is preferably fried fish skin, or some amazing meatballs/fishballs/seafood, etc.  Fish broth soup is supposedly the Chinese answer to the Ramen Shop invasion.  While Ramen shops tend to have the edge if they do offer the hand-pulled Japanese style Ramen, what the fish broth needs, is a simple assortment of ingredients, and a fish broth to die for.  Perhaps, that's where Deer Garden makes their first mistake : the broth.  In a short answer, it's not to die for.  There's another place down Highway 7 that offers better fish broth with more taste.  This broth here lacks taste.  It's not bad, but it's not perfect.  Mistake # 2 : ingredients.  At $8.25, you'd think there's more variety to the ingredients.  When half the menu is vegetables, and not enough assortment of fish/meatballs, or even fish dumplings, that raises a bit of a flag inside me.  The quantity doesn't help either.  Beef brisket slices and fish slices seemed to be ok in terms of quantity, but vegetables, and meatballs, not so much.  Also, offering Chinese broccoli to go with the noodles as one of the 2 ingredients is a little too much.  $8.25....and you have to be so limiting in choices?  No thanks.  Mistake # 3 : Speed.  My list of ingredients up top highlights how to make one of these bowls of noodles.  So, naturally, 3 bowls of these noodles, should take less than 10 minutes to arrive right?  No.  It took almost 20.  I don't know what took so long, but it did.    Consolations?  Yes.  That one waitress who seems to know what she's doing.  She's friendly, and she's helpful.  Worth going back?  Not for that price tag.  Just because you're a store that did relatively ok in Vancouver, doesn't mean you can make it big in Toronto with a Vancouver sticker on your window.  No hate against Vancouverites, but we expected more."}
{"text":"Good convenient place for noodles. Nothing fancy but lots of selection make Deer Garden a good place to go. Gets very busy and a recent price increase ($9.75 base price) make this place slightly less of a bargain."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place and so glad I did. Love their noodle soups! It's like pho but better! I have to warn you though. This place is BUSY.   $8.95 gets you a big bowl or actually HUGE bowl of noodle soup. You choose from their list of soup base, choice of noodles, choice of two meats or veggies, and special price for up to two side dishes. The pork cutlet and fried fish side were both really flavourful and well done. (this is coming from someone who doesn't even like fried fish).   I give them so many stars because I'm all about the value. Even though they were busy, service was fine and they were fast."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  That's odd, I thought I did a review here already...  Deer Garden's Scarborough branch is slightly smaller than the Richmond Hill branch, however it's just as busy as the Richmond Hill branch. If you arrive after 11:45 on a weekend, chances are you'll be waiting for a table.  I can pretty much copypasta my Deer Garden review for Richmond Hill, as my experience for both branches were quite similar. However I would say this restaurant was quicker in getting the food out, and they certainly do not rush you after you finish your meal. However, I find the drinks are better in the Richmond Hill branch compared to here.  Service was better here than the Richmond Hill branch. I mentioned already about the fact they don't try to kick you out after you finish, but they also were more polite and responsive to your (friendly) requests. I know it's not customary for Asian restaurants to get excellent service, but this one beats the other branch for sure in that department.  The Scarborough branch is also closer to my house, so chances here I would visit here more."}
{"text":"Dropping the .5 for service after last night.  Deer Garden has seen its business multiply in the past year. While that's a good thing, it has come in the expense of what was great service.  In my past two visits in this branch, all the employees kept rushing each table into finishing their meal. In particular, I was given the bill in my visit last night, without any explanation into why they gave my bill so fast!  I also noticed the employees aren't as happy as before...perhaps they're not getting their share of tips? I would think they would show some emotion if they're getting paid the amount they should be."}
{"text":"Had watery diarrhea 1 h after eating and 10 hours later in the morning. Stay away from their deep fried food and mayo. I'm probably going to faint after typing this review... Lost about 2L of water"}
{"text":"Everytime I want to get some soup and quick lunch, I will come here... The food isn't bad and they give you lots of noodles....  I suggest don't get their side order dishes as a alone dish because it is quite expensive when you order them alone. Ex. the ox tongue is $8 for 4 pieces. It is cheaper to add few extra dollars to your soup to get the small sides."}
{"text":"Bland food and even worse service. I'm not a fan of noodle houses by any means but go to Magic Noodle down the street instead."}
{"text":"Tried this place within a week of trying the other location and this place is friendlier but less generous with their toppings.   Overall, very affordable and delicious place to dine. Lots of options to choose from, especially within their noodle soup combos. Tried their deep fried pork chop and it good with all white meat."}
{"text":"I can't say I'm typically a fan of Chinese noodle places but this one sure tops the list with their affordable prices and variety of options. Their service could be friendlier though...   I am a fan of the Malay Laksa soup with flat rice noodles (ho fun). I chose their beef tendon and beef stomach for my two toppings and they were surprisingly generous with their toppings - bravo. I had a hot milk tea and I will be choosing cold the next time as it is much better. And I maxed out the sides with Desert wings with ginger and the deep fried fish filet. The Desert wings were good but nothing to rave on about. The deep fried fish filet was a generous portion and good but also nothing to rave on about.   All in all, it was a pleasant experience minus the waitress being a tad rude and also trying to get us out as quickly as possible as there were people waiting. This place seems to get quite busy for dinner on the weekend."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I ordered from their 'make-your-own' menu. You get to choose your choice of noodles, soup base, and two toppings (additional toppings cost extra). I chose thick rice noodles (these aren't your regular pho-style flat rice noodles; these are circular in shape) with a Malay Laksa soup base, and my two toppings were spliced beef brisket and fish balls.   If you're hungry, you might want to order extra toppings or appetizers because the bowl of noodles that I ordered definitely did not fill me up.  Now to get to the actual review of the food. I quite enjoyed the Malay Laksa broth; it was, I'd describe, slightly sour/very slightly spicy - though probably more sour, so if that's your thing, then this broth would be for you. The noodles themselves were quite chewy in texture. The sliced brisket and fish balls were nothing special. I'd say the highlight of this dish was the soup base; pretty much all of the flavour came from the it.   I ordered a red bean slush. I'd say the red bean slush was quite disappointing. I've definitely had better elsewhere. The ice was way too hard, and there was very little 'liquid', which made it difficult to mix or even scoop it up - the long, narrow plastic spoon that came with it didn't help either.  Overall, I'd come again."}

{"text":"you get a big old bowl of noodles that is perfect for a cold winter day. Its like chipotle where you build your own bowl of noodles from the toppings to the soup base. I honestly didnt really like my soup base which was the first one on the list cause it didnt have much flavour to it but my girlfriends was not bad. I kept on adding salt and pepper to mine to bring out some flavour. The curry and laksa looked good from the table beside. You also get a hot drink with your noodles."}
{"text":"This restaurant is another from a growing chain in Vancouver and Toronto. A big plus about this location is that it's so new it's possible to get a seat on a Saturday night with no waiting. As our first time, we ordered (1) signature fish soup with beef brisket, fried bean curd and beef tendon ball (2) laska broth with beef tendon, fish tofu and prince mushroom. Both soups were very filling on a cold winter night. The laksa was expectedly spicy and the fish broth more bland but that's okay because fish should be the main flavour. It gets five stars for service and being a new go-to snack spot when we want something filing and fast."}
{"text":"Went with my momma today for lunch. It's a great place for soup noodles & it even comes with a drink. My momma and I got HK Style Milk Tea but there are tons of options to choose from. The portion size for the noodles is pretty huge. You can practically share one between two people. Quality of the food is really good. And he price is decent. $9.75 (plus tax) for a big bowl of soup noodles and a drink. Would totally come back. ^_^"}
{"text":"Deer Garden Signatures, not the most obvious name for a soup noodle place.  However, they do noodles very well and the way you want it.  Pros:  Pick and choose your noodle the way you want. Lot's of choice and variety  Cons: Not Ramen type broth but still very good Can get very busy at times  Bascially, you get a sheet to customize your noodles with.  You pick a broth, toppings (you get 2 toppings to start, $1.50 for any additional toppings), type of noodles, and a drink.  There are many choices to choose from.  You think Harvey's gave you choice, this place takes choice and puts it on steroids.  Each noodle comes automatically with cabbage, mushrooms and bean sprouts and you can choose whether you want those or not as well.  You have full control over what goes into your noodle.  Love the concept.  Each noodle ordered also gets to purchase 2 sides for a discounted price.  The noodle itself is a very good soup noodle.  The broth could be better but's it more than satisfactory.  Portion size is more than enough for the $8.75 base price.  I was very full by the end of the noodle I didn't even have room for my drink while I was there.  I wasn't the most hungry at the time though.  I would of liked to see an add extra noodle option but that's just me being a glutton.  The drink comes conveniently in a to go cup, which is nice.  The service is also pretty good.  The place can get pretty busy at time so it might get a bit slow.  For the most part the ladies working were all very nice and speedy as they could be.  Experience was very good one.  I would definitely go back to this place to try other combinations.  I was delightedly satisfied and you will be too if you like Chinese soup noodles too."}
{"text":"Same story as the other Deer Garden in Scarborough.  This place isn't bad, but it's not as good as it's other counterpart.  Pros: Choose what goes into your bowl of boodles  Cons: Food is not as good as other location Staff feel distant  Gave this place a try because I am a fan of their location in Scarborough.  Coming in, the decor looks a little better than the other location.  I do notice though there are no large booths of any sort.  If you come with a party larger than 4, it could be tricky to sit your party without some sort of effort.    Once again, we do the usual and go for the noodle bowl which has complete customization.  The prices seem to have gone up as it's now $9.75 instead of $8.75 and the sides have gone up to $2.25 as well.  I get my usual Chaochou style fish and minced pork soup and my GF got the original fish noodle soup.    The food here doesn't stack up to other location.  I didn't feel I got the same amount of noodles I got at the other location.  The soup was also not as rich.  The taste is there, but the overall quality just seems a little off.  It's still decent value for what you pay, though it could of been better.  If you order a drink, it also doesn't come in the convenient to go container that the other location gives you as well. It's nice to have that convenience so it was something I definitely missed here.  When it comes to service it was hit or miss for us.  There were 3 servers we noted.  1 was very nice and friendly, 1 one was OK and 1 felt very distant.  The one that felt distant never smiled once throughout our visit.  Our little one likes to smile and wave to people she meets.  When the server was leaving our food on the table, our little one smiled at her, waved and said \"Thank you\" to her.  She looked at our little one with a cold stare and just walked away.  I'm not asking you to go out of your way to interact with her, but at least give her a smile back, specially if you make eye contact with her.  You're in the service industry, a smile is not too much ask.  My little one looked back at me confused like she did something wrong after which upset me.  I didn't make a big deal at the restaurant because I'm not that type of person but I was disappointed.  Like I said, the other 2 were more than hospitable, just that experience left a sour taste in my mouth.  This location is still a decent place, I'm just going to be frequenting the Scarborough location for my Deer Garden needs in the future."}
{"text":"My friend, Precilla C., visits this restaurant quite frequently so I was starting to become very interested in trying it out. We came here with a group of friends on a Sunday night and we had to wait for a couple of minutes for a table to free up. I would highly recommend making reservations if you're planning to come here during the busy dinner time.  I got the Malay laksa soup base with beef stomach, pork intestine and u-don. The soup was just the right level of spiciness for me and I was pleased to see that they weren't stingy with the amount of beef stomach and pork intestine.  I also got a side of deep fried pork chop (for $1.95!) and pan fried sausage slices with honey glaze. I have to say that the pork chop was done to perfection and I would highly recommend it. Although there was nothing wrong with the pan fried sausage, it's just not worth the price and I would recommend trying something else.  I also tried their cold milk tea and it's one of the best that I've ever had in the city so be sure to get it!"}
{"text":"Busy Chinese restaurant known for its soup noodles. Offers tons of customization of soup base, noodle type, sides, etc. which is great so you don't get bored. The price is pretty decent for what you get, so I'd definitely stop by for a casual dinner. It is busy and noisy though."}
{"text":"One of the best noodles places around. Their noodles portions are larger than most noodle shops, I can never finish a whole of bowl of noodles. I love how you can choose your soup base, toppings and noodles. My favorite is the tomato and pumpkin soup base. I also like their beef brisket and bean curd as toppings.   I've only had their rice offerings once and it's a good portion. I ordered the chicken teriyaki with egg on rice and the chicken has crispy skin and the chicken is still moist. The rice offerings is also very filling.   All of their meals includes a hot drink for free or you can upgrade to other more fancy cold drinks for $1-2.50.   Service is adequate and I've never had bad service here."}
{"text":"This is me and my friends' go to place for mornings after drinking and probably will be for a while. Try to avoid it on Saturdays/Sundays during peak lunch time as the lines get quite long, but I would say it's definitely worth the wait. The service is as you would expect from a really busy place, they are constantly moving around, but they will listen when you get their attention.  The food is great, very customizable and everything I've tried has been great so far (laksa, pumpkin, tom yum broth), and not only that, but you can add quite a sizeable \"snack\" add-on for only $2-3. It ends up being very filling for under $15, with above average soup and noodles, would definitely recommend trying this place out once if you haven't already.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place can get quite busy around dinner time as they offer a wide variety of customizable noodle soups.  They have many soups to choose from, such as tomato and pumpkin, black pepper and pig stomache, parsley and preserved eggs, malay laksa, tom yum, etc. The portions are quite generous and is great for the cold winters.  Be careful with what you order on the little piece of paper as many things have additional costs, such as extra toppings, cold drinks, side dishes, etc!  The price has been hiked up quite a bit since it first opened.. I remember it starting from $7.75 per basic combo..then $8.25..now I believe its up to $9.75."}
{"text":"Went with 2 other friends, we all made our own soup.  I got udon laksa with pork stomach and beef tendon. Both pieces of meat were tender and not overcooked from the very hot soup. The soup was extremely flavourful and thick. The udon was also much better than I expected. One of the best udon I've had! So perfectly chewy, not mushy or artificial tasting like frozen from grocery stores. I think it paired well with the laksa as well. My friend got egg noodles with his laksa because he thinks that's how laksa is normally served. We don't know. I was also surprised at the variety of veggies in the soup. When selecting my 2 toppings, I wanted to choose a veggie but thought 2 types of meat would be more worth my money. Even though I chose 2 meats, there were plenty of veggies.  I also got beef tongue as a side to try. I've never had it before. The meat was surprisingly soft with a texture almost like canned spam/corned beef but with a steak beef taste. It was very greasy but delicious. I don't love it but I'm glad I tried it. It's a unique cut that is made affordable by deer garden (less than $3 for 2 slices).  Overall, I think the price is good for value. This is my second time coming to deer garden. The portions are massive and I love that the make your own soup comes with a variety of drink options. I would definitely come again as well as reccomend this place to a group of people who want soup but can't agree on the same type. Ex. All pho or all ramen, etc..  Both times I got laksa because I literally do not know anywhere else where I can get laksa. I sampled my friends century egg and fish but didn't really like it. May try the Szechuan next time."}
{"text":"The fish noodle soup was better than most places in Toronto, but it was nothing too special. I would give 3 stars for the flavor and 0 star for the service. We ordered a Hong Kong style milk tea, when the server delivered the drink to us he spilled half of the milk tea on the table and just left without saying a word. And 3 times when the table beside us asked for spicy XO sauce the server said they would bring it over and at the end the couple next to us left without getting the sauce.  Did i forget to mention they gave us the wrong order and we had to wait another 15 minute for our food.  Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the excellent, unique offering at this restaurant. However, don't go there with a tight time frame as there is often a long wait during peak dining times (waited 45 min for a weekend lunch), and large parties can be tough at this small-ish restaurant (party of 7 was seated at a booth that was extended by a small table with 2 chairs.) It is in the Times Square mall. Had to prompt the waiter to get some food that didn't arrive (possibly because we filled in the order form incorrectly), but they were pretty responsive. Liked the hot appetizers a lot. Would return again; but will try to visit during an off-peak time if possible."}
{"text":"Very yummy! For 9.75, you get:  a) choice of soup base with mushrooms bean curd and parsley (these base toppings can be withheld) one column of options is no msg, the other column is not b) two meat or vege toppings, good selection too (an extra third topping was given for free for our meal but I wasnt sure why or if this is all the time) extra charge for extra toppings c) a 1.99 drink is included (hot and cold options available) can upgrade to any drink for the difference d) several snack options for $2 something are optional add-ons  There is also another a la carte menu for non build-a-soup meals. Clean, service is quick, food is yummy!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a Sunday night dinner, got there just before the dinner rush around 6:00pm.  By 6:30 there was a people lining up for a spot to sit down.   The build your noodle combos are excellent value with the option to add appetizers and upgrade your drinks.  Most popular soup base is the fish, but we also tried the chicken and thai style which was excellent.  Chicken wings were very tasty:) Also highly recommended is the french toast done HK style. The only disappointment that we had was the fish and chips which the kids wanted which was lacking both texture and flavour. Service was fast and courtesy.  Restaurant and washrooms were very clean which is a plus for a Chinese restaurant.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Deer Garden has two locations, on me at Steeles and Kennedy and one at Hwy 7 and Bayview. We like both locations and it's a \"build your own noodle soup\" type restaurant. They have a few pre set ones for cheaper but I definitely recommend building your own. You can choose your own soup base (NO MSG as advertised), 2 toppings (additional toppings are $1.75 each), choose noodle type, hot beverage included for $10.75. Premium toppings are $2.75 each but you can only add two premiums per bowl of noodle.   I always choose the tom yum which isn't like the Thai tom yum but it's still got a nice spicy kick to it. Toppings is very dependent on personal preference. I would recommend this restaurant to others!"}
{"text":"I come here a little too much at times, mainly cause they have laksa and you have the option to choose whichever toppings you want. The laksa here is alright - it satisfies your cravings. The soup is decently sized, though I don't think  additional toppings should cost $1.75/each (for the amount of the topping that you get - I'd say 1.25 is more reasonable).  Perfect place to come by during the cold autumn/winter days"}
{"text":"My family and I came here for dinner on a Sunday night around 7. They missed our name so our wait was a bit longer. Crowded environment but the food came pretty fast and the staff were friendly.  We ordered one regular fish soup base and two ????? (some sort of almond pepper soup base). For the toppings we tried fish fillet (nice and fresh), fish tofu (not that absorbent of the soup so it just tasted like fish tofu. Maybe try fish puff instead if you like the toppings to be flavourful like their soup base). The noodle bowl comes with a bunch of vegetables (mushrooms, bak choy, a bit of bamboo and others) so I recommend you order meat as your toppings (unless vegetarian). Also, I would recommend the regular soup base more than the pepper one.  For side we ordered teriyaki chicken which was super worth and delicious for $1.75. It was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Very impressed. For drink I got honey lemon water (cold; $1.00 extra). It was just a pretty decent honey lemon water I mean 3 ingredients that mix well together, you can't go wrong with that! all their cold drinks come in takeout cup whereas hot drinks are in a smaller medal mug.   Great food, great drinks but plot twist! Let's just say 'something' aka small creepy crawly fell (we think it fell) into my sister's soup when she was about done. We showed the waitress and without a single word she quickly took the bowl to the back. We had to run after her to nicely ask if we can waive the bill/dish since the accident... They agreed right away and apologize many times. We weren't fussy about this but seriously they need to clean their air vent (we sat under it)...  Overall, this restaurant was pretty good. Would have gave it 4 stars if it wasn't for the ... Yeah. Will come back for sure tho!"}
{"text":"I always order this tom yum soup. I drove all the way from downtown to this restaurant and I never have any complaint about this. But today me and my husband went here for lunch. The soup is way to sour I can't put my lips on it. So I ordered extra chicken broth they charged me 4$ for the broth. It's ok I don't mind to order it. After that I tasted tofu skin which had after tasted, it's doesn't tasted fresh. It tasted like it already gone bad.  It made me doesn't want to eat anymore. Just want to walk out of this place and never come back."}
{"text":"One of the few places that offer a good Laksa soup and with decent portions for their build your own noodle bowls. It comes as a set meal with a drink of your choice and also available options of side dishes. The price has gone up a little bit but still a good deal to have with the serving that they give you."}
{"text":"I just love the custom noodle choosing. No msg indicator for some of the soups and the variety along side. I'm also a sucker for small sides to nibble on everything on the menu. Love returning for some diy"}
{"text":"This location is not as good as the hwy 7 location. The peanut chili soup was not as rich and flavourful as the other location.   Service here is also spotty (even for Asian standards). We got yelled at for waiting outside instead of inside even though there was no space to stand inside. While I don't expect 3 star service I also don't expect to get yelled at by the restaurant staff either.   This is a choose your own adventure place where you get to pick soup, toppings and noodles. The hostess asked us to fill the form while waiting. So I asked for a piece of paper and she snapped back and told me to go get it myself. While I'm fine to fill in the form in advance, but if I'm doing this for your revenue maximizing benefit and not for my enjoyment, a little politeness would go a long way.   The crowd at this location is somewhat grimey too. The patron to the table beside me kept coughing but did not cover his mouth. Felt super sketch throughout my meal.   Overall, I would not come back to this location."}
{"text":"I'm an avid eater of Deer Garden. Great for quick eats and service is fast and friendly.  Prices have gone up for the food, so attaching the menu for any future customers."}
{"text":"I love the fact that you're able to customize what you want to eat in terms of noodle soup for whatever you're in the mood for that day, come back and get something different next time. Deer garden offers a variety of types of noodles, flavors of soup, and so many add ons. I ordered the Tom Yum flavored soup with fat noodle and beef and imitation crabmeat for add-ons. The verdict: delicious! I highly recommend this shop for lunch/dinner with friends and family. There's enough variety to make everybody happy. The flavor and quality are so tasty and worth the price.   Besides their noodle soups, they offer appetizers, sides, rice, and asian drinks. There's so much to explore! I'd love to come back here when I'm back in Toronto."}
{"text":"I do love this place and visit fairly often, but if there's ever something that sets me off, it's their customer service and employees.   We came here as a party of three to grab lunch. Seated almost immediately, all seemed to flow nicely and didn't seem like any problems would come up.   Ordering was quick as all of us knew what we wanted and had sent the order forms off to the employee in a few minutes after sitting down.   My order was correct and my dad's order came correctly as well.   My mother's order had a mistake as they used the wrong noodles (and there wasn't an error on the sheet either) so we asked if they could go ahead and switch it out for the correct one. You would think they'd do it immediately as it was a staff-made error and not one on our end.   The employee looked at us funny when we had asked her to swap them. So after she double checked, she comes back and says instead of changing it (which would be the right thing) she would go ahead and give us a bowl of cooked noodles (the ones she wanted) and have my mom pick out the noodles that she got. What.   My mom works in CS and knows how rough work days can be so she was extra polite in asking that they just go to the back and make the change. The woman give us another look of annoyance before taking the bowl away. She came back moments later and just swiftly put the new one on the table and left. Almost like \"I refuse to admit I messed up\"   I've never had a bad experience here so far so this was just a shock. Everyone's so polite and then this shows up :/  I'll still return for the food but their service is starting to burn a negative hole."}
{"text":"A great choice if you want something warm, fast and relatively inexpensive for lunch or dinner!   Deer Garden has a full menu and gives you a choose your own mix menu where you can select the soup base (they even have MSG free ones! I know, it's rare in Chinese restaurants), the noodle type, and extra ingredients from meat to tofu. In addition, it comes with a free hot beverage. And the almond milk is amazing (made from powder but still great!).  the 4 of us ordered 3 bowls of soup and shared among ourselves. And tell you what, it was very filling! The tomato soup base is a MUST TRY.  Overall, great experience would definitely come back =)  And while the service isn't top notch, (nothing new in Chinese places), they did serve in lighting fast speed.  Another note is the place can get quite busy around lunch/dinner time. Word of advice is to go 20 min earlier to skip the rush!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday around noon and it was super busy. Be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes at minimum before being seated.  Prices for food have gone up since opening and for two people our bill came out to $30 after tips and taxes for a bowl of noodles and a cold drink. Value wise, not the greatest.  In terms of selection for soup and noodles, it's pretty good. I tried the parsley and century egg fish base soup with flat rice noodles. Soup was a little bland but was still satisfying.   One of the better choices in the plaza as there are 3-4 other noodle joints inside"}
{"text":"Recommend dine in and takeout too. Bubble tea taste better than many bubble tea place and everything is on average or above"}
{"text":"8.75 for your own choices of noodles, soup, including 2 side dishes. The food wasn't bad at all plus the service was friendly. I came here 2 times. Ofcourse you would ask if the food was good why wouldn't I rate it 5 stars. The first time I went with my boyfriend and he ended up puking afterwards. The second time we came was because his brother dragged us along and this time I was the one who vomited a few hours later. The food isn't very sanitary if this didn't only happen to me. I had no other food consumed so there wouldn't be any other reason. I would come back but I don't think food poisoning for a yummy bowl of noodles is worth it. Try it out, maybe you have a better immune system than the both of us."}
{"text":"What can I say...deer garden became my noodle place of choice after my favorite spot closed down. I must say they have more soup base choices and they're defiantly not stingy on the toppings. However I wish they had more additional add-on options. Overall, the restaurant is clean, the service is fast, and the food is satisfying especially on a cold day. My only dislike is that like many other Asian restaurants, deer garden is cash only."}
{"text":"The service is very poor.  Food are alright but when we ordered extra noodle they put it on the side with no soup.  They would charge us over 3 dollars for extra soup.  This is ridiculous to eat noodles with no soup.  Their attitude was like no one gives a fxxk about you.  Items other than the noodles were below average which either overcooked or no taste. Price is at an acceptable range but we expected more from the server."}
{"text":"First time here and would go back to try other menu items. Food was alright. Broth is a little shy."}
{"text":"not a particularly cheap bowl of noodles.. it's pretty fun that you get to customize your bowl: from the broth to the type of noodle to the ingredients included inside -- for 8.75. but for more than two toppings, it's an extra 1.50, for a cold drink it's an extra $1.00, and for extra sides it's +1.99, so as you can see, the price increases pretty rapidly.  the service is good and the layout is pleasing to the eye.  this restaurant can also be difficult to find at night because their sign does not light up. a few of my friends had to circle around a few times in the plaza in order to find it."}
{"text":"Soup and vegetable quality and flavour, depends on what time you visit.  Of course, you can the best concentrate soup at lunch. You can the best price before 6pm."}
{"text":"As a regular customer at Deer Garden Signature, I come here two to three days a week.  I just love their Malay Laksa Soup with RICE Noodles. Some people may find it too spicy. But i just love it.    For a price of $10.75 you get noodles and two choices of toppings. I usually just choose double quantities of seasoned pork mushroom balls. It also comes with a drink. A cold drink is extra.  Their side orders that i would recommend are pan fried beef tongue and pan fried sausage slices with honey glaze.  I took away a star because of their service and seating policy.  If you go there alone. They will put you at a two seat table which can be very tight. If someone wants to go in or move out their ass will swing by your table.   Oh. I almost forgot. If u like spicy you must ask for their XO sauce. It is High quality compared to other restaurants."}
{"text":"I've been here two times and I would personally one back just for the food! The customer service is meh- the ladies who work there all seem like they hate their jobs.. Yeah I get it, customer service is horrible but you're getting paid so suck it up. I love how we can customize your noodles (soup base, toppings) and even order additional side dishes and a drink. I went on a Wednesday evening and we were seated immediately. I ordered the laksa soup with Korean noodles. The soup was the perfect amount of spice. The toppings I ordered were fish balls, beef balls and preserved eggs (love them) :) just a tip, they actually add veggies like Choy to your order automatically. For drink, I opted for honey green milk tea with grass jelly and it was $3 with my meal Pretty good deal considering the size. However I would not consider ordering the slushes because they were 2.7$ for a regular size. The portions are big and I could barely finish my bowl of noodles. Definitely recommend this place and would choose this over Chef Papa any day."}
{"text":"I love the concept of Deer garden where you get to choose the types noodles, broth and ingredients. They have a good variety for you to choose from for a set price of $9.50 which comes with a free hot drink.  Where they get you is all the side dishes. They offer many mouth watering side dishes like chicken wings, deep fried chicken, pork cutlet for just $2.75 if you ordered a noodle soup.  Although the price is right, I noticed the taste and quality of their side dishes have deteriorated a bit. For example, our fish puff tasted like it has been stored in the freezer for a bit too long, lacking that fresh taste. Also, a order of wings only comes with 3 tiny wings. I think 4 is a better number, why? Just because...  I also didn't enjoy my ginkgo pepper soup base.  It could be just me but the soup base was very bland. Almost tasted like I was slurping noodles from a bowl of hot water with a slight hint of fish flavouring."}
{"text":"We really loved this spot! It was a lot of fun choosing our soup bases, toppings, noodles, etc... We came here on a Tuesday and it was pretty busy, lots of families with kids. The restaurant is clean and modern and the service was decent.   The soups were really the highlight of the dinner, we tried a spicy peanut soup and the laksa base. These come standard with some mushrooms, cabbage and some green onions, there are tons of different options for toppings and noodles. Both broths were delicious and flavourful. The portions are absurdly huge but we still ordered a few of the side dishes because at $2.25 a piece, you can't really say no! We had the sausage slices, the ginger wings and the chicken teriyaki. All were good but the soup was the real star.   Hot drinks also come with the meal but you can pay a dollar or so more for a cold drink.   I can't wait for this to be my go-to spot for soup in the winter and I'm also looking forward to trying the different soups and noodles they offer. This is a great spot for a filling bowl of hot noodle soup and everyone in the family would be able to find something on the menu to enjoy."}
{"text":"Deer Garden is a fun food option because you build your own soup. And not a small bowl either, a huge bowl of soup! If you're not the type to finish a plate solo, I definitely recommend splitting an bowl. A base cost of  $10.75 entitles you to choose a soup broth, 2 add-ins (protein and/or veggie), and noodles of choice with an includes Hong Kong style hot drink (tea, coffee, lemon tea, ovaltine, etc.). For an added cost you can select a yummy side dish. No visit to Deer Garden was as exciting as my first for this reason. Deer Garden almost reminds me of Chef Papa.  My personal recommendations: - Malay laksa soup - Thai tom yum goong soup - Luncheon topping - Bak choy or choy sum topping - Instant noodles (easy to grip) - Side order of pan fried pork chop with maggi sauce or pan fried sausage slices with honey glaze  Versus the East Beaver Creek location, it is less homely but easier to find a table. Not the best bowl soup in the area but great to take a group once in a while."}
{"text":"Yummy selection of noodle and rice bowls, including laksa which I've not seen at any Asian restaurants in the states. Combo is a great deal!"}
{"text":"First time coming here with the recommendation of a friend.  Fish soup was average, fair amount size for the price you pay.  Utensils are all at the side of the table that you can easily pull out of the drawer (which I thought was cool)"}
{"text":"This noodle place opened up near my area not too long ago. Went there a couple of times and always enjoyed their foods. You can choose your own noodle bowls for a fairly great price, comes with a drink as well. There is a variety of options to choose from; broth, toppings, and choice of noodles. They can be large portions for some and can be shared between two. Would definitely recommend this place if you're craving some tasty noodle soup!"}
{"text":"A place where you can customize what soup base, noodle type, and ingredients you like! Each bowl already comes with load of veggies. What's different from other soup noodles other than customizing? Well they have no MSG options! Their fish booth does not contain msg...yes it's fish booth, but it's not fishy at all."}
{"text":"Delicious fish soup noodles with combination of your choice.  Big bowls, inexpensive, great choice for a simple meal!  Fried wings taste so good! Is a must try! Also cheap to add to the noodles.    Come with a drink as well.  Very good deal with money well spent!"}
{"text":"I was always a little sketched out to try Deer Garden after only hearing average - below average reviews from my friends.  But after eating all of Scarborough during my exams, I had nowhere else left and came here with a friend on a Tuesday evening.  The place was actually 80% filled at 6PM (good job).  There were 2 servers running around and they definitely need more people on the floor; it was a hassle trying to get their attention to order, get chili oil, and to get the bill.    I ordered the laksa base with vermicelli noodles, beef, fish tofu, and bak choy.  As the other reviews says, there is a generous portion and you're guaranteed to be full walking out.  The base wasn't authentic at all and and you can only get a minimal hint of the curry.   My friend got the chicken broth with udon.  So the contradictory evidence is that she finished her bowl (which is surprising, as she never finishes her food - but then she did tell me she was starving as we walked in) but I've never seen anybody use so much salt and chili oil into a bowl of soup.    We also got the teriyaki chicken and desert wings.  The teriyaki chicken was ok but probably wouldn't order again as their sauce tastes a little funky.  The desert wings is literally 3 deep-fried chicken wings.  Overall, comparing the quality and price of this place; it deserves 4 stars.  If they can brush up their soup base and service quality - it can be a decent 5-star restaurant. [SIDENOTE]: One thing I DISLIKED is that I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate how close their tables are together.  I get they try to fit in as many people as possible but goddamn, if I'm close enough to get splashed by your soup then you are TOO close."}
{"text":"My family friends took me here for dinner and I was super excited to try their new noodle soups. I am a HUGE fan of fat flat rice noodles in soup, I kind of set myself up for high expectations, they did not have the fat flat rice noodle in a noodle shop. They had plenty of other noodles and a handful of soup broth selections.   I got the rice vermicelli with the spicy szechawn soup broth. It was okay. It was not as spicy as I anticipated and tasted like peppercorns. Next time, I will get the Laksa soup, heard a LOT of good things about the laksa soup and looks delicious.   The portions are huge and are worth the prices that you see on the menu. The soup comes in a huge bowl with two toppings and a side for around 13.99. Not many selections to their sides but their bubble tea looks delicious! The fish puff side was kind of gross, no flavor and came out cold. The sausage was very yummy and the fried chicken was actually grilled chicken. I thought that it would be battered but nope, it was just grilled in a pan and nothing special.   The place had a nice atmosphere. I wish they had more variety in noodles and condiments like they regular chili slices or chili oil that you see at other restaurants.   We had a kid with us and wanted a side of meatballs. They said that next time we would have to buy another soup to get it, which TOTALLY did not make sense. If you wanted additional toppings to your soup, it's 1.99 so it was unnecessary to even suggest a ridiculous request. We already had three soups!   Anyways, 50/50 chance I might come back just for the Laksa soup but other than that, there are better noodle places around the corner."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend and we both got the noodle combo. You get to select your own soup base, noodles, toppings (two are free, additional are extra), and a drink. My friend had the malay laska soup base if I remember correctly and that one was delicious! It was very flavourful and had just the right amount of spice for a cold winter day. I had the original fish soup base, it had a clean taste. Not as good as the malay laska one but it was alright. The place is popular and the service is good as well for a Chinese place."}
{"text":"Currently my favourite noodle spot. This place specializes in rice noodles in a fish stock base and their make-your-own combo (~$10) is the best value option as it comes with a drink. Their soup is the star - you can taste the amount of bones put into it and the flavour has depth while staying light and not salty.   Go-to order: - Base: Original Fish Soup or Ginkgo + Pepper Fish Soup (really warming in the wintertime) - Noodles: Rice noodles (thick) - Toppings (2 free): beef slices, beef tendon - Drink: HK style milk tea: arguably the best in Richmond Hill and comes in an insulated cup!  I wouldn't order veggies as the soups already come with some beancurd sheets, mushrooms, leafy greens, and stock ingredients. Vegetarians will have trouble here - meat is in all the soup bases and/or most of the toppings. For my friend, french toast was the only option. Service is really fast, though it's sometimes hard to flag down the staff. But even with the long queues, they're cool with lingering and don't rush people through their meal. For lunch, it's best to come in small groups before 12:30 or after 1:30 to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"The hk milk tea drinks here are good. Ive been here a few times. I wasnt rlly impressed the first time bc i got the lunch menu, (the thai soup base with rice noodles +sliced beef and pork stomach) Boy did i make the wrong choice.. Pork stomach was gross, it made me lose my appetite because it tasted so sour. The soup base wasn't that great tbh. I came back today and yesterday, and had the chicken soup base + rice... Which i enjoyed much more.   i still recommend Deer Garden if you wanna try something different(ish).   ++ If you take out theres a charge of $0.50"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for late lunch. Finding parking spot was easy, there's plenty. Waiting to be seated was extremely fast. I guess all of this is due to late afternoon.   This place is known for soup noodles. The ordering menu was easy to choose what you want. There is an extra charge if you select more than 2 toppings for your soup base.   We ordered:  1.  Szechuan Spicy Soup with Sliced Beef, Enoki, Cabbage and Thick Rice Noodle.  2.  Tomatoes & Pumpkins Fish Soup with Sliced Beef, Enoki and Thick Rice Noodle.   3.  Pan Fried Sausage Slices with Honey Glaze  4.  Pan Fried Pork Chop in Maggi Sauce.   Let me just say that my wife and I were stuffed. The broth was delicious and tasty. We couldn't finish it all. The sausage with honey glaze was yummy for tummy. Pork chop was super tender. That was a lot of food!  My only regret was that we should've ordered only the soup noodles. Nonetheless it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. This Hwy 7 location is much smaller than its sister location near Steeles and Silver Star. I had to wait 30 mins for a seat.   While waiting I filled out the order sheet. I went for Szechuan Soup Base - Sliced Beef, Enoki, extra Cabbage and thick noodles. I also ordered Pan Fried Sausage glazed in Honey. My order came quick, approximately 5 mins. Very satisfying lunch. Although I find this location offer hardly any bean curd sticks whereas Silver Star offers it. Anyhow it was still a good lunch. It fits perfectly for today's chilly weather."}
{"text":"It is my to go place in the area if I don't wanna cook or don't know what to cook(specially for a toddler), I only order fish soup noodle to share with my daughter, noodle doesn't have much taste, so I always ask for spicy sauce, food come out fast, and service is not bad, basically all servers do is taking ur order sheet, bringing u food and bill, you can get all other stuffs from the side of the table(like napkin, chopsticks). The seats are comfortable, will go back."}
{"text":"my sister is a vegan and she went there with her friends, asked the waitress if there was any vegetarian options and she said no (which is totally fine), one of the spicy soup base could be vegan but theres shrimp paste in it, she asked if they could perhaps take away the paste but apparently the soups are all pre-made.  the only thing they offered was noodles and veggies served in boiling water... WITH NO SEASONING OR ANYTHING. she asked for at least some soy sauce and salt to be served with the noodles and got refused because the waitress didnt even wanted to make the effort. my sister was in a rush and her friends already ordered so she just dealt with it... having water boiled noodles and veggies in a RESTAURANT, what a joke.......  I also went there once before and ordered the original fish soup with noodles, and it was TASTELESS to me. not sure about the other ones, my friend ordered the tum yum and it looked good  this is my first time commenting, because i feel really bad for what happened to my sister. just really disappointed...  so yeah... vegetarians or vegans, beware of this store  peace out =v="}
{"text":"very good idea they have going here. you basically select all the parts to your own noodle soups. it's quick and not too expensive. roast beef sandwich is not bad either. my only downfall really is that i didn't have any deer option."}
{"text":"Good noodle soup selection and the service is usually pretty fast, so if you're looking for a hearty lunch or dinner, Deer Garden is a pretty good joint.  The price has gone up more recently - somewhere around $9.00+, but for what you get, you can't really complain.  The only real downside is the accuracy of your order. I've had a couple orders with ingredients that I didn't select, so if you're picky, take your chances. Your odds are good though... around 75%.   If you're into spicy things, consider the Szechuan soup, just don't get those peppercorns down the wrong tube :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service and good food.... tons of combinations which you can mix and match....varity soup base for you to choose from.... place always packed during lunch/dinner hours"}
{"text":"It's a cheap-eats restaurant HK style where you pick a soup base, type of noodle, two toppings, and a drink for less than $10.  I had their house signature fish soup-base and I found it to be nothing special. Two toppings is not a lot (although I love that they have a large variety to choose from, including offals) but the portion of the noodle and soup is huge and you can easily be full. The milk-team is kinda meh but it comes with the set menu.  If you are looking for variety, then the place really gets a bit expensive. Almost $2 for any additional toppings, and $4 for any sides. You can order their other stuff as well for normal chinese dish price (around $6 to $10).  Overall, for an HK style cafe, it's just okay - i guess the win there is that they have nice ambiance, but you are also paying premium for it.   Cash and debit card only."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a family dinner with 8 on a Sunday night. For 6PM, it was pretty quiet but by 7, the place was packed. Deer Garden is a soup noodle and rice place where they offer a variety of soups, noodles, toppings and sides. Plus they have a good selection of drinks and slushi. For example you can have original fish soup with egg noodles topped with fish fillets and cuttlefish. The choices are quite endless!!!  Decor: This location was quite large and modern looking. Big comfy booths with a neat wooden fishes hanging on top.  Food: With our large group, we ordered 5 noodles and 3 rice (chicken and unagi). My order was the Chau Chau soup with rice noodles, fish balls, luncheon meat and corn with 2 sides - fried fish and fish puffs. When the order came, the noodles were huge!!! After eating for 10 mins, it didn't feel like I made a dent in the noodles. Soup base was mild but I was hoping for a stronger taste. Generally, the noodles were good. But by far, the sides are a great deal - they are optional at 2.25 each but essentially you are getting half price apps. I highly recommend you maximize the 2 sides. We managed to try almost all of them - winners were fried fish, pork chop with maggi, terayaki chicken and sausage. Fish puff was so-so. Though I didn't try it, the rice dishes smelled and looked great.  In general, loved the place so i will have to come back to try the other soups eg Laksa soup! Great place to get your noodle fix."}
{"text":"Good for what is it, which is customized noodle soup. I had the fish broth with thousand year old egg and pumpkin base, it was bland - next time I'd come back to try their laksa which I saw most other tables order."}
{"text":"Decent place for soupy noodles. The bowls of rice noodles are flavourful, though from the \"build your own bowl\" options, I don't feel like they add enough meat to the dish. It's nice that there's no MSG but if you're not interested in just fish with noodles this place won't be for you. The various meats as side dishes are tender and are an option to add to your bowl of noodles. I had their 512 option, Pork and Egg on Instant Noodles. The bowl was quite large, but there could've been more noodles and vegetables. At $10.75, it is a bit pricey for instant noodles and I was expecting a bit more. The flavours were on point though and the egg was perfectly cooked with a runny yolk still in the middle. The chicken broth made the dish perfect for a cool, drizzling day.  Service is quick, with servers who are fluently tri-lingual.  The decor is okay, though if you sit near the entrance you will feel the wind rush in every time someone opens the door. The washroom is also exceptionally cold in the winter, it's like they don't have a heat vent in there."}
{"text":"This place is always a good lunch place. Soup with no MSG and good tasting. Nicely cooked noodle and quick on getting food out. They offer alot of variety in the noodle since you get to pick and choose."}
{"text":"For an absolutely huge bowl of noodles with fish soup, this is the place. I've heard good things all around, so decided to check out this corner restaurant at Times Square.  It's $9.75 per noodles + base soup + 2 toppings + drink. The problem is that there's extra fees EVERYWHERE...if you want a special soup based with fish soup, that's another $1.50, (so If you want Tom Yum, Laksa, etc but with fish soup). If you want more toppings, that's another $1-2 per topping. If you want a cold drink, or some other drink that's not listed as \"included\", that's another $0.50 - $2. So basically, be prepared for your meal to go out of control from $9.75 to $16 very easily! There's also side dishes you can order for $2.50, but a maximum of 2 per person.   That being said, the portions are huge, and that fish soup is so very good. It makes me feel comforted, and I know it'd be a perfect meal for cold Canadian nights. I opted for the parsley and thousand year egg, and they were generous with the eggs! Toppings was tendon and sliced beef - again, generous! I tried the side dishes beef tongue and fried chicken wings. The wings were incredibly salty - couldn't finish. Beef tongue was good!   Their cutlery is stored at the side of each table in a sliding drawer - convenient for us (especially for people who constantly need more napkins)  Overall, I'm happy with my bowl of noodles. I would consider this quite an affordable option, knowing the portion is so huge, since the side dishes and all the other \"extras\" are not necessary to make a satisfying meal. Oh, except the fish soup. That's a must!"}
{"text":"We have this at Vancouver and the flavour of the soup base was pretty much the same as the ones back home.  Great proportions of veggies and noodles in each soup.  We also tried the chicken steak and egg on rice. It was pretty decent and quite fulfilling."}
{"text":"My group of friends was planning on having a birthday gathering for one of our friends but we were not allowed to eat our cake in the restaurant after everyone ordered a full meal, because outside food is not allowed. I think it would be better for the restaurant's long-term success if they tried to accommodate reasonable requests like this in order to give customers a positive experience. Also, it was a hot day but they did not turn on the air conditioner.   On the plus side, the food was good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Excellent place, lots of flavourful soups to choose from.  I like their Laksa noodles.  You get a lot of food and a drink, it's very filling.  It's especially good when it's cold outside and you want something to warm you up.  Service is quick and location is convenient although finding parking can sometimes be a challenge.  Deer Garden is one of the best noodles bars, definitely."}
{"text":"This is one of my regular haunts for later night dinners open till 11pm.  Quick in n out.  I think there is a discount for preset menus after 9pm.  I think the no msg clam is only for the fish soup base, so I usually order noodle with fish soup, or rice donbori style rice bowl (How much msg can u put in steam rice?).   Overall food is not bad, fish soup is pretty good.  If you like black pepper, the black pepper soup is very flavorful."}
{"text":"This has become my go to for late dinners. It is one of the few restaurants open until 11 pm and service is super fast. Although they have increased their prices quite a few times over the years, they don't seem to have lost any customers. I usually get the sliced beef and enoki mushroom with vermicelli in spicy szechuan fish broth, but that was partly because it used to be part of a special menu that was cheaper after 9 pm. Now it still is a special but only $0.75 cheaper than making your own combo so there really isn't an incentive to get it. If I make my own combo for $10.75 I usually get the gingko and pepper fish soup with thick vermicelli. For toppings I like the pig stomach, pig liver, sliced cuttlefish, fish filet, and fish tofu. The cold special drinks are an additional $2.50 but usually decent."}
{"text":"Seems like the trend of customizing your own food is picking up.  $8.75 for a customized bowl of noodle, choose your soup base, 2 toppings, and noodle... just like what you do when you make it yourself at home.  I like the soup base and noodle and all, but the toppings are quite limited and it's like what I can make at home myself when I feel lazy and just want to toss a bunch of ingredients together. I do have to give them props for their no msg fish soup, that was one of the best soup base i've had in any chinese restaurants.  The best part of my meal is my drink : house special milk tea, best bubble tea I've had anywhere else (other than chatime)"}
{"text":"Compared to other locations, this one is not that busy, but the service here is much better. Great food and affordable prices.  The only disadvantage is that they only accept cash and debit."}
{"text":"This is the newest location of Deer Garden, a Hong Kong Style Cafe franchise from Vancouver specialize in Fish Soup, just opens up in Scarborough.  You pick the combination ($8.75)  Soup base Noodle Toppings (first 2 are included and any extra is $1.50 each)   Choice of drink   The broth always serves burning hot, so be really careful. I always order the fish broth base but there are also chicken based or even spicy one you can choose from.  Make sure to ask for the house made xo hot sauce.  There are also set set which are not soup noodle to choose one. A great place to come with picky eaters as they can customize their own meal.  Cash Only.  I though got really thirsty after eating here. I really doubt their claim of no MSG."}
{"text":"Deer Garden, a Vancouver Based franchise just opens their first location in Ontario.  Specialized in fish broth based rice noodle soup and other Hong Kong Style Cafe offerings is quite decent. The menu is not as extensive as what they offers in BC but is a good start.  Noodle Combo ($8.25) with your choice of  Soup Base, Noodle, Toppings and Drinks.   My Choice : Original Fish Soup+Rice Noodle+Sliced Beef+Fish Tofu+Milk Tea was good, didn't wow me though. I found the fish broth is a little watery and light. Portion is good as a snack unless you add some more toppings ($1.25) or order side dishes. Side dishes are $1.75 each and you can pick up to 2 .  Side Dishes: Pan Fried Sausage Slices w/Honey and Desert Wings with Ginger. The chicken wings are good size and meaty and I do love ginger!!  Aside from Noodle, there are also other options: sandwiches, snacks and steamed rice.  Steamed Rice Combo only offers during lunch and dinner for $6.50 includes a drink.   Steamed Rice: Minced Pork Cake on Rice can make anyone that loves rice jump for joy as there is 2 full bowl of rice in an order.   Vegetables & Mushrooms in Fish Soup ($5.95) was also a good choice if you want to eat more healthy.  Deer Garden is a good choice if you want something light and fast. Nothing here is too fancy or over $10! The vibe is young and full of energy, I can see it will be a popular place for young people to have a quick bite or to hang out.  Cash Only!"}
{"text":"Fish soup w rice noodle combo, 8.95 dollars You can get a big bowl of noodle plus one drink You can choose the soup base from 12 selections. We chose Laksa, CHAO SHAN style and white pepper soup. Very fresh and yummy Mine was Almond milk, Brian's coffee  and Wesley's ribena. Very popular and nice decor"}
{"text":"This is the best place ever!!! I come here so often that my friends and I started calling it \"the usual\"!!!!!  I do not recommend coming during the following hours if you have a party greater than 4: 12:25pm (lunch rush) 6:30pm (dinner rush)"}
{"text":"My all time favourite customizable noodle soup place.   Honestly, I get the exact same thing everytime (laksa with thick vermicelli) so I can't comment on other soup bases, but the laksa here is the BOMBBB. Can't bring myself to try something new because I always crave the laksa. It's fairly spicy though so beware if you can't stand spice.   I also tried their spicy fries for an appetizer. You get a gigantic portion but NOT SPICY AT ALL. Very plain-tasting so I would not recommend getting. Their chicken teriyaki app is also very meh. Just stick with their noodles and drinks.  Service: wait time for a table is pretty long if you go around peak lunch/dinner times. Service is not the best; the waitresses often just forget about me after getting seated so I have to grab menus for myself. Typical Asian service that you'd expect."}
{"text":"Noodle soups are probably my favourite food group. For $11.50, you can customize a big bowl of noodle soup (soup base, 2 toppings, type of noodle) plus a drink. I'd say that it's a little bit on the pricey side for noodle soup, but it's good quality and the portion size is large. I couldn't finish it all. I'm a fan of this place! I know a lot of reviews here are complaining about how every time they come the price increases, but I mean mans gotta pay them bills! Also, I'm a big fan of their HK milk tea and the fact that it is served without sugar mixed in already. Into it, will be back!"}
{"text":"When arriving, we had to wait about 15 mins to be seated for our party of 4. I had the Malay Laksa soup and pork cutlet on the side. The soup was delicious"}
{"text":"Honestly it wasnt good. Lack of flavor. Sure they have quite a few soup base. This is my second time here. Still not impressed."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner after hearing so much about this place. It's the only time I've ever been to Times Square in Richmond Hill. The noodle soups were tasty and inexpensive, so I will likely be back!  I ordered the malay laksa soup base with thick rice noodles, fish balls, and seasoned pork mushroom balls. Yum! I love spicy laksa and it goes really well with the rice noodles. Both the fish balls and the pork mushroom balls were delightful. You're given a small glass of tea upon seating, but you can order an included drink with your noodle soup. I decided to get a hot milk tea. Boy was it bitter! I added 2 sugars to it and it was still too bitter.  I'm looking forward to coming back to try some of the other noodle soup combinations."}
{"text":"Perfect place when you're in the mood for noodle soup! I come here for the noodle soup where you can customize the broth, type of noodle, and toppings! Food comes out quickly if they aren't busy and service is good. The only things are they don't accept credit card, and lunch hour here is hectic, you're lucky if you get a table during then."}
{"text":"I, honest to God, keep saying I hate this place but I keep coming back. The main points about Deer Garden is that you're customizing your own noodle bowls (for about ~10). While that is fun and all, I'm not sure if the price is exactly worth it (since they did hike it up a dollar).   I really enjoy the spicy broth here; I get it every single time. There's no large problem with noodles themselves. Those are good.   The issue is service. I've been here about three or four times, maybe more. The first two times I ordered the dessert wings with my noodles. The first time I did not receive them and had to get it removed from my bill. The second time I did receive them (after reminding the servers since it never came), but they were nearly raw on the inside. The server told me that was normal, but no, that's called possibly giving customers food poisoning. They gave me new ones (to be honest, I think they just refried what I gave back), but it was still a little pink. At this point, I just sucked it up and ate the wings, but I never ordered them again.   I would return purely because I like the noodles, but it'd be hard convincing me to come. Poor service and near food poisoning places Deer Garden at a 2.5."}
{"text":"When this place first opened, it boast no MSG in their fish soups which unheard of when most Chinese restaurants use MSG. I love their customize option that allows you to pick the base of the soup, the noodles and the toppings. As well as they have a ton of flavourful side dishes that are well priced at an extra $2 each. I definitely recommend the salt and pepper fish soup with thick yellow noodles along with fish tofu and pork stomach lining."}
{"text":"Dear Garden Signature Scarborough is probably my favorite noodle restaurant in Toronto. But the service of this location is so disappointed. I came here twice and both of my experience were really bad. The waitress didn't take care of the clients at all and they are EXTREMELY rude. And this location is always busy so always expect a 5-10 mins wait. Reason I'm still giving 2 stars is because the taste is nice.   Highly recommend Dear Garden Signature Scarborough. Do not go to this Richmond hill location if you can."}
{"text":"Second location for this franchise in Toronto.  The food is not bad, i just hope they really arent lying when they say no MSG.  i did feel thirsty after the meal.  My suggestion is to get the SPAM .. its quite tastey.  also, the maggi sauce porkchop is definitely a must.  They also have the HK style milk tea which they literally use a pantyhose to filter the tea.  Overall not bad... decent for the price."}
{"text":"It's okay. The restaurant smells fishy but it's to be expected. Price is 8.25 for basic combo.  Not too bad."}
{"text":"Deer garden is a pretty good neighbourhood option for something reasonably priced and filling. I've been to both the Richmond hill location and this new one, and the quality of the food is pretty consistent. They have a variety of soup base to choose from (no MSG options available) and you are able to customize noodle type, as well as toppings. The soup base does taste relatively healthy, and I can actually drink it.   My only complaint (hence the 3 stars) is that they keep messing up my order, even though everyone gets an individual piece of paper to put in their specifications. The first time, they gave me the wrong noodle and I had to ask for them to provide me with the right noodle type on the side in a separate bowl. But wow, all that noodle wasted! The second time, they mixed up the soup base and one of the toppings between my order and my bf's. So I ended up having to ask for a separate bowl so I can put all the right elements together! Is it really that hard to keep the orders straight? It's something that they can improve on.   That said, I enjoyed my experience overall and I would probably go back again!"}
{"text":"Deer Garden is one of my go-to noodle places. The amount of customization is amazing and the combo is only $10. Lots of different soup bases, lots of noodles, lots of toppings, and you even get a drink with the combo. I usually upgrade and get their milk tea with tapioca which is not bad at all. The side dishes are also fun add ons for a few dollars. If I'm super hungry, the fried chicken wings are great, but usually the large bowl of noodles is enough for me. If you don't want noodles, they also have great options for rice bowls that are tasty as well.   The place is pretty busy during the usual peak hours. Try to come earlier or later and you'll most likely get a seat. It has typical Asian decor but it is nice and comfortable with modern accents. Service is good. I usually see the same waitress whenever I come and my requests are received in a timely manner and I've never had a bad experience. It's not the best service, but you won't have a bad time.   For good quality, a large variety of options, and a quick and hearty bite to eat, Deer Garden is an excellent option."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place I enjoy coming to when its cold or chilly outside on a winter or fall day.  The tomato and pumpkin soup base is my favourite.  And I like how I can get udon (my favourite also) as a choice of noodle with no extra cost, which most places charge extra for. I personally don't like to come here during the summer time because it gets too hot inside the restaurant, or maybe it's just because they should turn down their thermostat.  When I'm craving for some comfort food, this would be one of my goto places."}
{"text":"Watch out if you are going with a big group.  I was with a group of 11 that got there around 10pm on a week night.  The restaurant was practically empty with a couple of waiters around.  We sat down and ordered our food by writing down on a piece of paper.  Laksa is a wildly popular choice. The time for the food to get to our table was pretty fast.  However, the server pretty much just dumped all the dishes on the table and we had to sort out what belong to whom.  Same with the drinks.  At the end of the meal, some paid by cards and some with cash.  Again, when he came back with  trays of changes, he just dumped them on the table for everyone to figure out.  It was super confusing.  In the end, he short changed us because i didn't get my change!  Talk about disorganization and confusion."}
{"text":"My friend made a reservation and when they arrived they said they won't set up the table until someone in the party arrives. I don't think that should be considered taking reservations.   The waiting area is cramped and the fish soup smelled weird in the area.   The waitresses are crude. They just assume you know Chinese and I saw a customer who didn't know Chinese being yelled at all of a sudden. Apparently she was blocking the way but didn't really know that she was saying.  Water requests take forever. It's been over thirty minutes already.  When the food arrived, it wasn't anything really to write home about.  I would just go to D&R Wing at Bamburgh which has the same crudeness of the waitress staff for a much cheaper price."}
{"text":"First time trying Deer Garden was in Vancouver several years ago and it wasn't too bad. Lots of opportunities for customization and the meal came with a drink. Fast forward a couple years and it finally comes to Toronto. Decided to come one weekend for lunch and it was packed. It was almost a twenty minute wait to be seated. This place definitely lacked insulation or heat, even the staff working behind the counter was wearing a puffy jacket.  Good thing the noodles came out piping hot, some customers definitely opted to keep their jackets on for the entire meal. Chose the chauchou style fried fish and minced pork fish soup, the broth was quite flavourful but the parents chose parsley and century eggs fish soup and they found that very bland. They had to ask for chili oil which isn't available on the table. The server will bring you a plastic container with a spoonful. Given a decent amount of noodles and soup, only two choices of topping though but it was just the right amount.  Overall, don't think there will be a return visit. Nothing really stood out and considering everything as a whole, it was a pretty average experience."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here because you can build your own noodle soup for about $10.  The soup bases are mostly msg-free and are variations of fish soup.  You can also get Malay laksa soup base too.  You then pick your toppings which you'll need to startegize.  The noodle soup already comes with cabbage and mushrooms so pick something else.  Like the King oyster mushrooms or some protein.  You can also get chicken wings for additional cost but it's only 3 chicken wings.  It's a large bowl of noodles so consider splitting one if you don't have a large appetite. My favourite is the Malay laksa with rice noodles and luncheon meat.  Sometime I get the fish soup if I feel like drinking the soup too."}
{"text":"I love this place. You can customize your own noodle bowl (eg soup, veggies/meat toppings, side dishes) and it comes with a hot hk style drink in the price. This location seems to be less busy than the one near p-mall/milliken. Favourite flavour is lhaksa (little bit spicy) and side dishes are chicken wings and cow tongue. The wings are good ol fashioned fried chicken and the cow tongue is so tender and flavourful."}
{"text":"Came here with family and my 2 year old son. It was quite busy for lunch but luckily we were able to get a spot with a highchair. They had a lunch special that included a drink as well. I ordered a noodle with beef tendon and broth, as well as a mango smoothie. My husband got a noodle with fish balls and a milk tea. The pricing was excellent (around $10) and also a drink with $2 more if you wanted a specialty drink. The portions were huge, and I was hardly able to finish my bowl of soup! However, they didn't have too many ingredients and mainly was a bowl of noodles. The broth was very tasty though. The mango smoothie, was not a smoothie. It was a powdered mango drink with lots of sugar. Same with my husband's milk tea, it was quite sugary and it would have been nice if you could choose the amount of sugar you wanted in it like Cha time, but I guess it was a free drink. In general, service was quick, seating was comfortable. The price point was excellent for a lunch deal and you get a free drink."}
