{"text":"Nice contemporary Bar in Old Town Scottsdale that opened 3 weeks ago. Inside bar has open windows and outside patio seating too.  Had a pint of Uncle Bears West Coast Style OB IPA locally brewed.  Outstanding IPA beer!"}
{"text":"What an unexpected pleasure. We weren't sure another distillery was needed in old town, but this is a fun place.  The food is great,  and the use of green chili is well done.  Try the green chili cheese fries! The tampiquena ribeye is delicious. Try the Lexington,  like drinking coconut and pineapple juice,  but with a KICK.  Mike #1 is a great server and great guy."}
{"text":"Came as a group of 6 and sat on the patio. The service was awesome! We were sitting close to the speaker and we asked them if they would turn it down and they did with no problem. We were there for several hours and spent some time at the end talking to a nice guy who I assume is the manager. The food was really good too. After appetizers we all had burgers. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour with a friend around 4 on a Monday. When I walked in, there was a sign on the hostess' stand saying \"Please wait to be seated\" but there was no hostess. I looked around and someone who I assumed was the owner or manager walked over to me to ask what he could help me with, and when I asked for a table on the patio he said \"Sit wherever you'd like\" and seemed annoyed that he had to assist me. Why have a sign that says wait when I can just choose my table? I knew they had happy hour because I saw it in their Yelp photos, but they did not give us the happy hour menu until we had been there for at least a half hour. Our server was nice but extremely quiet. We decided to just stick to drinks (which were fine, nothing special) and skip the food. Overall, not impressed. When you're a new bar/restaurant in a saturated area you really need to \"wow\" people to generate repeat business. Hopefully this place gets it together!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very friendly service, prices good, sweet potato tots are a don't miss. Shrimp and bacon grilled cheese sounds overly rich, but was great. Great place and will return when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I used to come here when it was Eddies house
Blue clover is a very nice concept. The staff are knowledgeable and o' so kind 
The 2 bartenders that assisted me tonight where Nick and Farrah 
Both were absolutely fantastic 
The place has been completely gutted and redone I like what was done with the place it is nice bright and airy 
They distill there own spirits currently they solely distill vodka and will be working on gin next 
I tried two of there vodka's a grapefruit and a lemon 
Both of the flavored vodkas were very tasty and not at all synthetic. the lemon would be perfect for  a lemon drop and the grapefruit would make a fantastic greyhound
I see good things in there future
Check them out for happy hour 
They are known for there bc pastrami fresh from Carnegie deli in New York 
* make sure to come early as they sell out quick 
The julep is fantastic perfect for those pre derby  days of post derby  game"}
{"text":"Grreat new establishment! Service was spot on - attentive without being over bearing. Had the house special flat bread - fresh, home made dough, fresh veggies and crispy crust - perfect!    Also had the Kicker sandwich - again fresh meats and veggies. Also good sized portions - would also come again for happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"Blue clover is just what that corner needed!  Craft food and beers.  The owners did a great job w the interior and ambiance.  I highly recommend in house distilled vodka and flat bread. Excellent!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Stumbled upon it while out and about in Old Town. This place has amazing drinks! Delicious food! Great service! I think the location keeps it from getting the business it deserves, but trust me, it's definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Service was great!  Everything was great actually!  The only one star off was that it wasn't kid friendly.  We ordered Mac and cheese for our little girl and it was spicy.   Yikes. Could of warned us or made it kid friendly at least.  Oh and the bloody Mary's are extra large and wonderful!  Mom loved it! But we will be back!  The nachos with Ribeye was one of the best nacho plates we've had.  Everyone except the little girl was happy with the food and drinks.  Get the giggle water!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. The drinks are fun and fresh. Best part was the staff. Very attentive and engaging. I will definitely be back and I'm telling all my friends.  Come check this place out."}
{"text":"Very strange and Unsatisfying experience! We got there and were taken to our table which wasn't cleared at all (which we were cool with). We assumed maybe it was overlooked. Then the night got worse and worse. We ordered our appetizer which we were warned the kitchen was backed up, but 45 minutes to an hour later when it finally arrived, it was wrong. We were asked if we still wanted it and we decided, why not? They brought us the correct one about 10-15 minutes later. The first round of drinks came out smoothly, but anytime we were done and brought another, the dirty glasses kept piling up, we had to ask for silverware and our water was only filled when we initially got there and once after we already closed out. The main issue was after two hours we had to ask about our entree we ordered. The waiter frantically said he would go check on it, only to return saying they had made it, but lost where it went to. So we told him we would pass on our food and asked for our check. No manager came to talk to us nor was there really any efforts to make it right. They comped our wrong appetizer and the correct one, but that's it. It seemed very disorganized and the staff did not seem prepared. Hoping this isn't the trend for a new establishment and they can correct the operations going forward! I would hate to have other people have the same experience we did."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and sat at the bar. Tim behind the bar took care us.  Ordered the pig wings to start with and a Mule Kick (Moscow mule).  Holy crap the wings fell off the bone and full of flavor!  The mule kick had to be the best crafted Moscow mule in old town.  Tim gave us samples of their triple distilled vodka, lemon, and Chile vodka.  Wow!!! Smooth and very clean.  Their vodkas go thru charcoal filtering twice and gives the spirit a very smooth and clean finish.  For lunch we did the rib eye Mac n cheese and Blue Clover Kicker.  This place is a must try!!!  Definitely coming back.  Plenty of space for patio or inside dining."}
{"text":"This place used to be Eddie's House across the street from Frank and Lupe's. I love when a new place opens in an existing location, but actually takes the time to remodel, and Blue Clover Distillery did exactly that. The entire place has been modernized with a beautiful indoor/outdoor polished stone bar and both private and communal tables. Gray tones and wood accents prevail.
 
The service was perfect. The bartender introduced himself by name, asked for mine, and actually used it throughout the night. He also engaged in casual conversation with me, an art lost on many other bartenders.
 
I had the shrimp bacon grilled cheese sandwich. I thought it sounded like an odd combination and worried that the cheese would cloud the delicate shrimp flavor. I was pleasantly surprised. The sandwich was slightly spicy and the shrimp created an amazing textural component to every bite. The shrimp flavor was muted by the cheese, but was still very tasty. A harder sear with a bit more salt might beef up the shrimpy flavor. But I would get it again as is!
 
I paired that with a house salad with a cilantro lime dressing and a cucumber gin cooler. The cooler was refreshing, but bitter for my taste. Perfect for those who like a touch of bitter in their lives. $15 for the sandwich and $12 for the cocktail."}
{"text":"From the  cucumber lime cooler to the Keylime pie. And the ribeye  amazing !   The food and the service was exceptionally amazing.    The waiters very attentive the food was Cooke to perfection and the best  in old town. You have to visit Blue Clovwr for an evening to remember !"}
{"text":"Great food, terrific drinks, and amazing atmosphere!! The service is awesome too!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Service beyond compare.   Must try the fries with green hatch peppers and cheese.   Ribeye sandwich also awesome.   Weston gave us a tour of the new distilling operation too !   Nice patio outside.  Love it."}
{"text":"Came into Blue Clover and order their signature Blue Clover Kicker with sweet potato tots on the side and it was amazing! The Kicker is served with turkey, bacon, pastrami, avocado, sprouts, tomatoes, red onions, and mustard aioli served atop fluffy pitta bread. I highly recommend it along with their in house distilled grapefruit vodka. Awesome having a distillery in town with great atmosphere, food and drinks. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks. Manager Tim is fantastic and bartender Nick is amazing and makes a rockin' cocktail! Can't go wrong here, large variety of food, great veg options! Clean, fun atmosphere and good music. Love it!"}
{"text":"Tried this new spot for a late dinner on a Thursday night. Nothing really negative to say, but nothing to rave about either. They did a really nice remodel of the space, and it has a great patio and indoor/outdoor bar. Our server was very friendly and chatted with us about the cocktails. We tried the giggle water and Scottsdale sunset, both delicious, not too sweet. I had the falafel burger with sweet potato tots. The tots seem made in house (definitely not from a giant Costco bag of frozen tots) and came out piping hot and delicious. The burger was a little dry and not as flavorful as I hoped it would be. I asked for a side of tzatziki, which was surprisingly thin (the consistency of ranch dressing, instead of thick like Greek yogurt). The menu is very basic - burgers, sandwiches, flatbreads - and done decently, but not amazing. There are just too many good restaurants nearby for this place to stand out to me. I am not adverse to returning, but will not be rushing back."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday for lunch. Good service. Fast with drinks and the chips I ordered. I got the turkey green choke sandwhich- a little in the drier side, it was good tho. I got giggles drink- that was good, I thought it would be sweeter, not too bad. The server was excellent, very nice and attentive. I would go back. It was so pretty and sitting outside was so relaxing!"}
{"text":"My husband And I ordered an Old Fashioned and they were made by Ferris; they were great, best I've had in a while.  I had a pita sandwich and it was good, as were the sweet potato tots.  My husband had a house flatbread, he also thoroughly enjoyed this as well.  Great job!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Our family decided to try this place before a night at a Giants Spring Training game.  Upon arrival, it was pretty empty but very hip and very clean.  No problems there.  Once we were seated, the waitress kindly took our drink order.  My wife ordered a giggle water and I ordered a mule kick (Moscow mule) with Ketel One vodka.  

Next came the food order.  My wife ordered the Caesar salad but asked for the prickly pear dressing which they said they did not have anymore because they were switching menus the next day (3/15/2018).  I ordered the fish tacos which were supposed to come with plantain; and the green chili cornbread fritters.  Within a minute after ordering our food, the waitress came back and told us they no longer had the cornbread fritters or the plantain that was supposed to be served with the fish tacos.  so my question is why have a bunch of menus with various ingredients and menu options on it if you don't have it available?  why not just scratch it off the menu so there's no confusion OR keep all the menu items stocked until the date you decide to switch to a new menu?  not rocket science.  by this time, I was more than a little annoyed and I'm sure the waitress could see it by the look on my face.  not her fault, I get that, but damn, make a decision.  is it on the menu or not?

my daughter and I ended up ordering the fish tacos.  the rice that came with them was still crunchy as it was not completely cooked.  and the tacos themselves were very bland.  the tortillas literally looked and tasted like they came out of a bag and they didn't even bother to put them on the griddle to warm them up.  

and remember that Moscow mule I ordered?  when we got the bill, my $12 Moscow mule turned into $17!!!  they added $5 for Ketel One vodka and didn't say anything!!!  I couldn't even bring it to their attention, just left with my head shaking...

if they don't change their way of doing business SOON, they're not gonna be doing any business at all!  EITHER WAY, NO THANKS, WON'T BE BACK!"}
{"text":"New and Delicious!

Stopped by at dinner time.  Waiter Jeremy was helpful with recommendations. Both of us had the salmon on quinoa along with a local brew. Yum. I never met a key lime pie I didn't like and their version in a glass was fun and tasty!  Ladies next to us were enjoying \"Bottomless Mimosas but we didn't have the time for those!  Wish we lived here so we could go back!"}
{"text":"The Blue Clover Distillery recently opened in Downtown Scottsdale in the spot where Eddies House used to be. This is Scottsdale's first Distillery. You can get some house made spirits here! This is a casual restaurant with wait service. The menu is mostly casual food but much of the food is laced with New Mexican Peppers. Inside are regular tables, a bar and community high tops. Outside is a patio and bar. 

My husband had the Spicy Shrimp Scampi Bacon Grilled Cheese with Sweet Potato Tater Tots. He said it was very tasty and the shrimp were cooked nice. We think it was the Vodka Prickly Pear Jam that made it special. On the side were Sweet Potato Tater Tots that we both thought were great!

I ordered the Corn Bowl with added Chicken. I didn't know if I wanted the small or large so I asked the waitress to show me with her hands the difference in size. She said the small is just an appetizer so I went with the large. I received a bowl of mostly mixed greens and a lot of chicken. I don't know why this plate is called a corn bowl because it only contained trace amounts of corn. My salad also was suppose to contain many other ingredients that also were all (or maybe not?) given out in trace amounts. I thought the house made BC. Mezcal Cilantro Lime Vinaigrette was very good but WAY TO POWERFUL for this very delicate salad. The salad would have been VERY GOOD IF it contained more corn, beans and cheese to balance out the strong dressing. The chicken was good in my salad and they gave me far more than I wanted to eat.......but the Chicken was PRE-COOKED and served refrigerator cold.

 I rarely ever complain about pricing but I feel an $18.00 meal called a CORN BOWL should contain more than trace amounts of CORN and the other main issue I had was a $18.00 Corn Bowl with Chicken should be made with Just Cooked Hot Juicy Chicken...not pre-cooked and cold.

The Chef himself did make an appearance at our table and asked us how things were. At that moment I was upset about my meal and I just said it was \"OK\" because that was the truth...OK at best. I didn't feel like talking to him because it's obvious that a Corn Bowl should have corn and an $18.00 meal should be made fresh to order. I didn't feel I could say it in a nice way at the time.

It's TOTALLY possible I ordered the ONE HICCUP on the menu.

At the time of this review this restaurant is newly opened and may still be working things out."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks after they opened with some of my co-workers on the weekend. Let's just say this place was not ready for the public. 

One of my co-workers tried to order the Chef's Special and was told there wasn't one (so why weren't we told this before we started to order?).  

Another co-worker tried to order a dish with fish but was told by the same server that they had to throw out their fish stock because it went bad (are you serious?!).

I ordered some appetizers that I could get anywhere else and it was probably the best thing on the menu. Co-workers ended up eating my food instead because the portions were big. Sad!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the grand opening yesterday.  The food is amazing. I had the owners favorite steak with green chili and calabicitas. The steak was tender and the squash was delicious.  I also tried a Moscow mule.  It comes in different sizes and you can keep the copper mug for $3.00.  What a deal. I can't wait to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Good service. I had the Baja Poke Bowl, which was light and tasty.  The tator tots were great."}
{"text":"Checked this place out while day drinking in Old Towne.  It recently opened up.  The cocktail menu is very good and I went out of my comfort zone and order the Copper Blues.  Very good drink, almost dangerous if you are feeling Austin Powers like.  Unfortunately, we were not that hungry cause the food menu looks exceptional.  We did get the nachos, which you need to bring your best appetite to power that down, HUGE portion and very tasty.  I look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Last night my boyfriend and I were actually walking to a different bar, when we walked by Blue Clover Distillery and decided to check it out. We love trying new places, and this one has only been open since earlier this month! 

We went on the later side of the night, so we weren't eating - but their menu looked pretty tasty so I'd like to go back to try the food. We each tried two different drinks: I had the Giggle Water and the Lexington, and he had the Whiskey Helps and the Blue Clover Julep. 

The Giggle Water was very good, not too strong of a tequila taste and kind of refreshing. The waitress recommended this first, as it's not as sweet as the Lexington, which was a good recommendation! The Lexington was definitely sweet, but good. If you like summery rum cocktails like I do, I think you'll like this, even though it's vodka. I did and I really don't like vodka! My boyfriend also really liked his drinks; he usually gets an old fashioned and he enjoyed the Whiskey Helps a lot, especially with the pomegranate flavor. 

We also got to sample their own lemon and grapefruit vodkas - they were pretty good! Like I said, I'm not big on vodka, especially not flavored vodka, but I still liked these :)"}
{"text":"Hmmm. I have mix feelings about this place. I'm giving in a 3. I know this place needs a couple more years to build up to its name but there is really nothing special about their food or the atmosphere. It is like you typical bar with salads, beer, and comfort food. I ordered their salmon entry, which was alright. The salmon wasn't season well and I was able to try my friends food- didn't taste the best. I'll give it try one of these nights, again."}
{"text":"Great selection of infused vodka and perfectly made mules. 
On the food side, there was nothing in the menu that appealed to me. All greasy, overly stuffed comfort food. I tried everything on their HH menu and everything was delicious, just not my style. 
Love the patio area."}
{"text":"In town on business and caught the grand opening of Blue Clover.  So much fun!  Great craft cocktails and the BC Pastrami is the best!"}
{"text":"A friend tipped me off on this new local distillery. Was hoping to hear more about their house made spirits, but maybe you need to sit at the bar to ask questions? My friend new to ask, so we tried a few of their spirits ($1 for a taste) pepper vodka had some kick, lemon vodka tasted more like syrupy lemoncello, and the pear was candy sweet. 

Our server helpfully suggested I sub plain vodka in my Scottsdale Sunset- thanks for the recommendation- it was a nice patio sipper. It's on the edge of Scottsdale, so not a Scottsdale bar scene. Lots of families on the patio the night we were there. Chill scene if that's what you're looking for."}
{"text":"I am a little late with this review but at my visit the restaurant had only been open 2 weeks but i am willing to go back and try it again and update my review because I do feel it takes time to get things rolling smoothly.Stopped by this new spot close to Old town Scottsdale for dinner with my husband and daughter. We tried the giggle water cocktail it was nice and quite refreshing i would order it again. The service was good the ambiance was cool. It's kind of small on the inside so it does tend to be hard to have a conversation. The menu sounded great but it lacked A lot of flavor. We ordered the green chili fritters and the jerk chicken with house salad. The fritter tasted like plain corn and not a lot of zing to it.  The jerk Chicken was cooked well but it lacked the spice flavors that you expect when ordering jerk Chicken it was quite bland. The house was good it was pretty simple. The interior decor is nice and they have a nice outside patio for this awesome weather.  I will give a month or so a update my review. Stay tune!!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and environment. If you're looking to go somewhere and have a good conversation, sit outside because the music is pretty loud inside, at least it was during the evening. The menu isn't large or overwhelming, but the food was good. We went for drinks and appetizers and it was a good place for that."}
{"text":"I'm blown away this was my favorite restaurant. I told everyone I knew about this place. We have had a few kitchen mistakes totally understandable with a new place and I've always paid eventhough!!  BUT today we were told we were not allowed back in there WHY because they've messed up WOW never in my life have I been treated like that!!! WOW!!!"}
{"text":"Our waitress, Linda, was amazing. She was attentive, happy, helpful, offered us suggestions and was just all around a very pleasant young lady. Great service!! The food was very good. All in all, a great little spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try out the newest Old Town restaurant. We were very happy!  Nice menu, very friendly staff, beautiful interior and food was very good.  I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Good apps and drinks. Good service. Nice outdoor seating. Walking distance to old town."}
{"text":"This is a great new addition to the Scottsdale bar scene. You can't go wrong. Food is a little pricey ($17 for tacos), but still worth it. High quality ingredients, including house distilled & infused vodkas in their cocktails. 

If you're here with friends, you can order a Moscow mule for 4 that comes in a giant copper mug that is for purchase at a reasonable $10 over the drink price. You can also purchase a bottle of their vodka for $22. Pretty much a steal for small-batch, local vodka."}
{"text":"Great dinner, drinks and service tonight for a large party!  Really enjoyed the menu options and the Scottsdale Sunset was amazing. Definitely a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Great new spot!  Most of the spirits here are made in site,  which is pretty cool. 
Their happy hour lasts until 7!! Bonus points for that. 
The prices for HH  are fantastic. For beers, wines, specialty cocktails,  appetizers,  and flatbreads  you can get some pretty great deals with a max of $9. 
We split the house flatbread and the chicken salad. Both were delicious.  The half order of salad was huge. 
I ordered the cucumber gin drink and it's now going to be my summer jam.
Light,  refreshing and very crisp.  So good!! 
Casual vibe and huge patio"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! The green chili cheese fries are mouth watering. The house flatbread is one of the best flatbreads I've had. I would recommend this place every time! Oh... and they make their own vodka.. the citrus peach infused vodka they make will blow your mind.. try it."}
{"text":"Great food and and awesome atmosphere! Tim the bartender was amazing and knows everything about the vodka they make in house! This is a perfect date night spot. I couldn't help but giving them 5 stars after what my date gave me. Good work Blue Clover!"}
{"text":"Was here about a month and a half ago. Service was fine, but food was awful. We got the Mac n cheese app and bacon & shrimp grilled cheese. Mac n cheese had a strange queso cheese. It was supposed to have a cheese blend. It was bizarre. The bacon & shrimp grilled cheese (sounded so weird that it could be good, recommended by server) was 2 slices of kraft cheese, 2 slices of bacon and the worst shrimp I've ever had. Looks like it's since been taken off the menu. Got 1/2 and 1/2 sweet potato tots and fries. Half the tots were cold in the middle. They were fairly new at the time, so hopefully they've improved."}
{"text":"Was happy to see this place pretty packed on a Saturday night.  Menu was decent.   Drinks seemed pricey.   For a distillery was surprised there was NO showcasing of their homemade liquors and cocktails.  Once we inquired there were some specials to chose from.  I ordered the Scottsdale Sunset made with their infused grapefruit vodka and that was pretty good.  
We ordered fairly healthy.  Husband enjoyed a deconstructed turkey club and I had a falafel burger.   Good portions and food seemed fresh.  Certainly want to go back and try their more southwestern pub cuisine which seems to be the theme.  
Biggest complaint was the absurdly loud techno music which didn't match the scene, vibe or sports playing on tv."}
{"text":"Rubber frozen chicken over bagged Costco wilted Brown romaine and a tragic pita sandwich that tastes like the Arby's 2 dollar special. The wait staff was very nice although the service was slow.  There was a ladder and a broom and dustpan on a handle behind the hostess stand which I thought was weird.  Maybe the drinks are good if you like foo foo bubblegum vodka."}
{"text":"Very cute place! The food was great and they had a pretty decent happy hour. The green chili burger was delicious. I'll have to go back to try other items from the menu:)"}
{"text":"We stopped by for dinner on 2/3/18 Sat evening .
Met Holly Holms who gave folks autographs and 
posed for pictures.
I had pastrimi sandwich with tater tots and my wife had chicken sandwich. The food was excellent and the service great. Very nice decor..  we will return... :-)"}
{"text":"Visiting from the East coast, we popped in here to watch a basketball game and had a great experience.  Nick, the bartender, was knowledgeable, easy to talk to, and gave outstanding service while managing multi tasks and responsibilities.  We did a vodka infusion flight which was smooth and a good compliment to the Baja Poke Bowl.  We also had the pork shank wings that Nick recommended and were a must try.  Finely, fish tacos were fresh and 2 layered blue & white tortillas make it a lot less messy.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and drink! The manager Lex made sure we had a great time and the food was spectacular!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with a friend...great new local spot! Got the falafel burger with sweet potato tots...LOVE at first bite! Great spot for taking clients out for business lunch, date night, or a great happy hr! A must visit for the out of towners and great spot for locals."}
{"text":"We had such an awesome time at Blue Clover! They have some yummy happy hour bites and drinks! They distill their own vodka right now and said they will start to distill gin and whiskey! The bartender, Ferris, even gave us some tastes of the vodka that they made! They play great music, all their draft beers are from Arizona, and the service was awesome! This place is going to start to become very popular, so go and get to know the staff!"}
{"text":"Great service by Mike #1 - we will add the Blue Clover to our dinner rotation. Food was great as well as the cocktails. Only issue is a $12.00 drink should not be overflowing with ice."}
{"text":"We had family in town visiting and we were trying to figure out where to eat. We came across Blue Clover and decided to give it a try. It's a little off the main drag and appeared to have adequate parking although it may be harder to find on a weekend night. There were not many people in the restaurant  but it was a Monday night. We decided to sit outside on the patio to enjoy the beautiful night. First thing we did is order drinks. Everyone had the mule kick that had Blue Clover vodka, lime juice, ginger syrup & ginger beer. Now i am not a big fan of the Moscow mule drink but let me just say WOW! This drink changed my mind. It was fantastic. 
We also ordered a couple of appetizers, both the chicken nachos and the green Chile cheese fries. Both were great but the Chile cheese fries were outstanding. My mouth waters just thinking about them. This would something that I would order on every visit. Mmmm! 
I ordered fish tacos which were very good and made with the fish of the day. Others in our group had the pastrami sandwich, flatbread pizza and the green Chile cheeseburger. Everyone was very happy with their food and agreed that everything tasted great."}
{"text":"Well Your usual Scottsdale Beer/Liquor Bar Service was not there unless you were at the bar and this place was dead. Place was hot and the music was shall we say, poppy and whats trendy!!!Weekends must be better as some have stated."}
{"text":"Usually opening weekend is a hot mess at any restaurant but that was not the case for Blue Clover! Not only was the service outstanding but the food and drinks were equally as good. Being from New Mexico good green chile is something you are always on the look out for and the green chile cheese fries did not disappoint. Would highly recommend!"}
