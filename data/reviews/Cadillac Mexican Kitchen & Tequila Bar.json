{"text":"Overcharged during happy hour and our waitress disappeared for a half hour.  Horrible service.  We expected better service."}
{"text":"This place is must if you are in the area. Great mexican food. Plus great drinks. If you like sports they will put whatever game you want on. Great place to kick back and recover."}
{"text":"Went here the other night! And let me say as a Vegas Local this place is now my new Favorite! You got pretty waitresses and a tequila bar that is said to have over 60 different Tequilas!!!!! If only I could try all of them and still be standing hahaha

The food is amazing I tried the Ahi Tuna Tacos and the Chicken nachos both were full of flavor and reasonably priced compared to other vegas restaurants.

As for service, It was awesome!  like I said they have really pretty girl servers in cocktail dresses who were super nice and got my order out quick and correct and made the whole experience at this bar very pleasant! 

Another thing I like about this bar is located just inside The Golden Nugget by the Shark aquarium pool So you get away from the casino atmosphere and can have a booth looking out towards the pool!
I give this place 5 stars!"}
{"text":"It started with the dirty looks from the hostesses, followed by our waitress, Vanessa, trying to push us out as fast as she could when we walked in more than an hour and a half before closing. My husband ordered Corzo on the rocks and got it as a shot instead, I ordered a dirty martini and the bartender made it with sweet vermouth instead of dry (made it too gross to drink). Our food came out fast, but tasted like it had been microwaved. They did last call right after our first drink order, which was just under and hour and a half before closing, they also would not seat anyone else after we were (again, and hour and a half before closing!). So the over all review would have to be terrible service, terrible food, and way overpriced. Do not go to this place!"}
{"text":"there is a sit down restaurant & and a take out right next door on the side. i've never been to the sit down side, but i've been to the take out portion many a times on many a occasions, and they're usually very good explaining & customizing your orders. if the line is long (five or more people/orders, you should expect an experience of about 20-25 minutes). but the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"One star because the food was actually pretty good. No more stars outside of that because the experience was less than a good dining experience. It started with us being sat next to the service well and kitchen entrance in a three-quarters empty restaurant. 

Next, our table proceeded to become the table next to where every employee was gathering with nothing else to do other than celebrate an employee's  birthday after a 10 minute hangout. 

It also took 30 + minutes to get two orders of grilled fish Tacos and a side of grilled vegetables. Unacceptable. You don't have to be an expert to know that piece of grilled fish the size of your pinky do not take that long to cook. Add on that the restaurant was far from busy and I couldn't tell you what was going on in the kitchen to take this long for food."}
{"text":"Just left this place. Waited to be severed, the hostess was busy watching tv so after a few minutes we sat ourselves. I had a group of 8 coming. My mother in law asked one of the waitresses if she would tend to us. The waitress said \"I saw you we work in shifts\"... first of all, we don't know that you saw us because we waited to be seated and had to seat ourselves and then watched as another group waited a few minutes before they got tended to. Second, we don't know that you work in shifts. We left me came next door to claim jumpers. We don't want to bother a hostess and her tv and a waitress with no customer service skills."}
{"text":"This place was beautifully put together...for the most part!  Lounge seating is very neat, but a few extra pillows for your back may be needed.

The service was great! Bartender was really trying to keep up, but the waitress was checking in on us often.

The huarache was delicious! Great masa with just enough beans and a beautiful presentation.  The side sauce was excellent.  The selection of drinks was appealing.  And the strawberry margarita was very refreshing and tasty.

Excited to go back with more friends!"}
{"text":"Love the food. I eat here every 2 weeks. Bianey is a great server and always makes you feel welcome! Try the chicken enchiladas and cheese dip. My personal 2 favorites there."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome, great food, was hot, looked good, margaritas awesome, I took the family in the afternoon for lunch, waitress was nice, all in all wonderful experience, Katherine was knowledable and awesome thank you for all your hard work."}
{"text":"I came here last night after a late night of drinking and gambling. My boyfriend and I had a great time. We got the queso and chips appetizer, and it was quite good. It wasn't anything to write home about, but it was a decent starter. For our main courses, I had the braised beef with corn cakes and he had the chicken sandwich. Both of our meals were amazing. The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because I question how much alcohol played a part in my enjoyment of out meal."}
{"text":"Stopped here for quick bite to eat before a show we were going to.  Had chicken nachos and ahi ahi tachos. Tacos were good but real small and pricey. Nachos were pathetic not worth the money.  Service wasnt great either we sat at the bar and even though its small we hardly seen the bartender."}
{"text":"Norma best lady ever miss the Cadillac bar and grill back home she was wonderful thank you Golden Nugget for making me feel at home"}
{"text":"This place was horrible. The food was bland and the margaritas tasted like sugar and lime syrup minus the alcohol. Plus we had 3 different servers that took our order twice. Never waist your money here."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place inside the golden nugget-very friendly people,,confy couches to watch the tvs and eat some delicious chips with warm salsa,,,nice price drinks,delicious beef nachos...with guacolmole...affordable..we went twice!
The view of the pool is'nt bad either!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Just left this establishment, do not sit at the bar! the service was absolutely terrible. The bartender was careless and did not provide any type of service. 10 minutes just to get drink menus, another 10 to order, and 20 min to get chips and salsa. Got tired of waiting and canceled the chips. Just a terrible experience. The bar back was much more nicer at least. Its a shame, really nice decor and tequila selection but terrible service."}
{"text":"Wonderful place, once we had to wait a while for someone to help us, but all of the sudden, Katrina was there to the rescue.  Love the food and the service.  Love the location and the way the restaurant looks.  Only down fall is that you have to pay for parking as it is located inside the Golden Nugget Casino and they charge parking.. other than that. it is great."}
{"text":"I didn't go into the main restaurant.  I went to the right of the restaurant to the to-go side and had the best salad.  I would highly recommend. The guy at the counter was friendly.  Definitely beats the crowd and food outside on Fremont Street."}
{"text":"Margaritas are very tasty, however I think they fall a little short on the tequila.  I had three of them in an hour and never felt like I had a drink.  Guacamole is a large order and pretty good.  Chips are just so-so."}
{"text":"After some hard gambling and harder drinking, we were in the mood for some tacos but did not want to drive. Luckily we just happened to be gambling at the Golden Nugget and found this gem after searching for tacos on yelp. We were seated quickly.  We ordered the chicken nachos, the blackened shrimp tacos, and the guacamole and chips.  Everything was brought out quickly and was so yummy. Our server was very friendly and attentive.  We will definitely be coming back. It's next to Claim Jumper. We had never explored this side of the casino before, so it was nice to know this place is here."}
{"text":"The food was really good...but the reason for my review is more of a big thumbs up to the chef that was on shift while we were there. My husband has a very high shellfish allergy and for the years that he has had it (11) I have always taken it upon myself to let the wait staff know about it..we were at the Cadillac on Tuesday of last week and the chef, Jay, came out to talk to us about he was going to make sure there was to be NO cross contamination what so ever!!  This was the first time that has EVER happened! So great job Chef Jay!!!"}
{"text":"Ironically, I had told my sister to never eat Mexican food when traveling because most places don't have it as good as we do in Texas. Should have stuck to my own advice, but my husband wanted to eat breakfast here on our last morning in Vegas. First of all, I asked for a not spicy bloody mary because it causes my stomach to hurt. Mine was as spicy as my husband's, who requested his that way. I had sausage with my breakfast and it tasted like a hot dog. My husband ordered the omelet with chorizo in it. It looked like a hot dog and tasted nothing like chorizo. The manager came to our table and asked how things were and my husband mentioned how he had asked for chorizo and not gotten it. She responded that it was \"sausage patty chorizo and they just cut it up\".  LOL Chorizo is chorizo no matter what form it's in, it still crumbly  My husband grew up in south Texas on the Mexican border, he knows what chorizo looks and tastes like. They also didnt serve chips and hot sauce like any reputable Mexican food place does."}
{"text":"We just arrived to the Golden Nugget hotel just in time for happy hour! We decided to stay in the hotel and visit Cadillacs. Margaritas were on our mind! We walked in and were served the best house Margarita I've ever had! I suggest the house margarita with a kick of jalapeno! Our server Kaytlyn was amazing. She was friendly, very attentive, was very engaging, and had great energy. She was on top of it from start to finish. The food we had: chips salsa, chicken salad, tacos, etc.. everything was phenomenal.  Sometimes you don't know who, and what, you're going to get, but this time we got it right!!! EVERYTHING was outstanding we loved it. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 2 stars because the food smelled good. Unfortunately I didn't get to order a drink or food. After being told we could sit anywhere, all staff disappeared from the floor. We waited 10 minutes then went and found some menus from the service station. Still no bar or floor staff. When they did come back, they sat at tables flirting and chatting. We gave up and went next door. This is a business plan that can't even be successful in Vegas surely."}
{"text":"Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! In what used to be part of Carson Street Cafe the Golden Nugget put this. This place has an identity crisis. Is it a sports bar, nightclub or restaurant? The margaritas were okay, I guess. Although my husband order a Coronita (Corona and Margarita) and there was no Corona. Maybe the waitress didn't hear us because the music and football game were at ear splitting volume. The food was ehhh. I had the Baja Shrimp Salad and my husband had the Mexican burger. They lacked any real flavor. The food wasn't filling either (I ordered a pizza when we got home). I wanted to love this place but I don't."}
{"text":"Moved recently to Vegas and wanted to try this place. Early dinner. The place was very nice, food was great, and our server, Ayla, was terrific! The manager, Katrina, even came over to see if everything was to our satisfaction. That really made my day! The night before we were at a highfalutin steak restaurant that served me bad, horrendous smelling stone crabs and the manager never came over and I had to hunt him down to express my displeasure!"}
{"text":"For food to-go. It's a small counter service stand attached to the bar and restaurant. Carnitas tacos are the best I ever had."}
{"text":"This place will bring me beans, they'll bring me cheese, they'll bring the rice, and the bring me a tortilla but they will not bring me a burrito what the fuck is that!!!!!!!! WHAT THE FUCK. They literally let us walk out. I can't even believe that!"}
{"text":"Came in w/ a large party last night for a business dinner. The staff was friendly & full of willingness to make sure our experience was a great one. Drinks & apps came out quick. The chips & salsa was adequate. We did order some Cadillac wings, which is the mildest of the 3 wing options. They do have a little quick w/ a whole lot of flavor. I myself ordered the combo fajitas platter (chicken, steak & shrimp). I requested hot sauce. None to my liking though. The young lady offered to get another kind from another restaurant within the casino. The food was great & everyone within our group was happy w/ their choices. Sadly they only offer 1 dessert. That dessert is Sopapias. Imagine donut triangles w/ chocolate, ice cream & whip cream. SO GOOD! Being a local I don't pop into a casino much to eat, but glad we did last night."}
{"text":"Food was really good, very fresh. I ordered the huarache, it came with a side of pico de gallo salad? A little confusing and quite heavy handed with cilantro. But that's my only complaint. My boyfriend ordered the chicken fajitas and they were screaming hot (as they should be) and the chicken had an excellent flavor. We would both highly our dishes. 

As for service, our server was Jennifer. She was very sweet and patient. I was really indecisive. I could tell she really knew the menu and was able to talk me into trying something new! I had requested no onions and she gave me the info on them, that they were pickled and could have them on the side---turned out they were delicious. I also overhead her talking to another table and she expertly answered questions about the tequilas. I'd say keep this girl and giver her a raise!!!"}
{"text":"Came back after the strip to eat at our hotel and I my husband and I wanted Mexican food. Service is awful. The waitress could careless about guest unless your a single guy or guys. I ordered a torta and she said it came with rice and beans and it did not. Not to mention it tasted awful I couldn't even eat it. Ten bucks of nothing. Than you order chips salsa and gauc for nine bucks ya not worth it. My husbands buger was fine but he was so upset I was unhappy he didn't want to eat. Over all wouldnt recommend unless you like bad service or hey if your a single man who wants a fourty your old woman to give you a lot of attention."}
{"text":"Great Guacamole.
Awful salsa... The claim jumper has better salsa. Also, if you're a tequila bar and someone orders Anejo, don't give them silver. The ahi tacos were good too, it's overall just not a well executed MEXICAN place."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and great food. I had the Mexican burger and it was cooked to perfection and the flavor was even better. I also tried the 42 oz drink and it was good."}
{"text":"We stopped here one afternoon, during our most recent trip to Vegas. 

We stayed in the Golden Nugget hotel too. 

I found the food was good, but very rich.  You get full quickly.

Like most of the brands owned by Landry's Inc, they serve good food and have very good service. 

It's expensive but pretty good Tex-Mex.   They do make a good Margarita too.  

This is a good bet if you are looking for decent Tex-Mex food and Margaritas by Downtown Vegas / Freemont."}
{"text":"Great bartender, he recommended the Mexican burger, it was AMAZING!!! I will be going there by next trip in town. Great tequila selection with a good happy hour."}
{"text":"What do you do when you did well on the penny slot machines at the Golden Nugget.  Well inside towards the Carson Tower is this Mexican bar and kitchen they call Cadillac.  Nice modern seating and a curved bar facing  a couple of big screens and lots of displayed brand name liquor.  Sit anywhere we were told and we wanted to sit at the bar and watch a game.  Ordering was easy, the bartender was friendly and did not long to make a mango margarita and a mojito.  Both drinks were great paired with crispy tortilla chips and a mild tomato red chili salsa dip.  I ordered another mojito but it will be \"to go\", no problem except it's never as good as that first one that came in a giant Margarita bowl and this one in a plastic cup.  We stayed awhile but then the game on the big screen is over and done with.  Time to get back to playing the penny slot machines and will be back to the Cadillac bar for more drinks if we win..."}
{"text":"Service is great and the margaritas are yummy. Food is really well done and very tasty. Dana our server got us enrolled for the Landry's Select and we have already reached 600 plus points! Great bar to watch sports and chill. Go in and have a drink and eat some food."}
{"text":"When im downtown and want Mexican food i usually come here.  I usually get the carnitas tacos, i have also tried they're Chile Relleno which was different than I'm used too. I won't try it again,  I'll stick to my tacos. I normally go by myself so I'll sit at the bar and eat there or go next door to their take out section which has 2 tables if you want to eat on the go"}
{"text":"Great service and food. Atmosphere was great but overheard a female manager tonight 3-10-18 speaking horribly to her staff. Made me very uncomfortable. You should be as kind to your people as you are to your customers."}
{"text":"Overall the service was lousy and sloppy. For example when I arrived there were plenty of seats and it was just me, and I was going to sit at the bar. The hostess was completely unhelpful and I was eventually seated at a lounge table. The server was OK but my food arrived before my drink and without silverware. The table next to me didn't have silverware. I'm sitting waiting for silverware, waiting for my drink, and when I finally started eating my food, it was barely warm. For a Mexican restaurant, the food lacked any real flavor and the chicken tacos that I had were as dry as the Vegas desert.
Very mediocre food and service."}
{"text":"The Cadillac is the best place downtown for happy hour.  The drinks are delicious (Guava Margarita, mmmmmm) and the appetizers are enough to build a meal on.  This time, we dined on chicken quesadillas and pork tacos, which were served piping hot.  The server was so pleasant and checked in with us several times to ensure that we were enjoying our food.  We sat on a big comfy sofa, and even though the restaurant is near the casino, you get none of the smoke and noise.  There is a little add-on next to the restaurant which serves drinks and snacks to eat there or take out.  The $5 original margarita is potent and terrific."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with some friends before seeing a show at the Golden Nugget.  It was during the week so we noticed they have a happy hour menu Monday - Friday 4-7pm and 11pm-2am. The dining area is very clean with a great view of the Nugget pool area.  There are also tv's galore around the restaurant.  

They have some great happy hour specials with $4 margaritas and deals on some appetizers.  We decided to share the chips with queso.  Delicious!  The queso was so creamy and tasty.  I'd definitely go back for more.   We also split the chicken quesadilla.  This was smaller but it was pack full of chicken.   Again, it had great flavor with their spicy salsa on the side.  

Service here was ok.  Our waitress could have come over to check on us a few more times.  I realize it was a bit busy for happy hour but when you are eating something spicy, your drink tends to run out quickly!  

I do wish they had regular tables to dine at.   We were seated on lounge benches with a coffee table height dining table.  It's just a bit awkward at times to eat like that.  

Otherwise, not too shabby with a great location."}
{"text":"Had so much fun with my co workers. They are the best. Food was awesome and from what i  could remember you guys are super cool. Lol"}
{"text":"Wish I could give it zero stars. Sorry to bother your early evening couch straightening   Party you had going on. Only people in the restaurant and we didn't get checked on once. I would have kept drinking the margaritas all night if someone would have asked. I was so upset we walked out of the nugget completely. Oh well."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing. The tables were a bit awkward but the ambience and service were great. Our party of 6 had the burger, pork quesedilla, chicken  quesedilla, and enchiladas. All AMAZING, I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican burger. Thats what i recommend. Has chorizo, bacon, mexican cneese, avocado, good artisan bun, and good flavored/cooked meat. It comes with fries. This place has good guacamole, chorizo queso, nachos, and habenero salsa. This place is pretty pricey though. Pretty good peach margarita (on the rocks). I got the chicken tacos (appetizer) and they were mediocre fyi. Good service."}
{"text":"Stopped in here several times over the few days we were staying at this casino.  We sampled a few of the different house drinks and enjoyed them all.  The food was also very good (note, we tried the chicken nachos at one point which were average at best but meh) but just about everything else was pleasantly delectable.

It was also nice to have a choice of a high table or to sit on a couch with a coffee table.  TV's can be seen from anywhere making it a hotspot to be during certain games (this mens if a big game in on, you wont be able to get in).

i would (and did) recommend this to family and friends."}
{"text":"Good food fast the rellenos de Cameron oh my god it was new years and they still had good service witch is alot because  vegas seems to forget that on newyears"}
{"text":"I ordered Tacos Al Carbon for lunch. The food was horrible, no flavor. It was just dried chicken with a tortilla wrapped around it. No love was put into cooking, won't go back again."}
{"text":"Great food Great service, so recommend this joint. Still licking my chops!!! Always a pleasure to drink & dine here. Never miss a chance to go."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant in the Golden Nugget! The food was great and prices reasonable ... service good too!"}
{"text":"I'm going to try and be accurate and choose my words carefully.  Being a Mexican, I certainly didn't expect this to be authentic and I was correct. The food is similar to an El Torito or that type of Mexican food, but its what we expected. My husband and I both ordered margarita rocks, the drinks came in glasses that looked like they should hold a hot fudge sundae instead of alcohol, but that could have been excused if the drink was good. The margarita was so sweet we had to order a separate shot to lessen the sweet, and when we got the bill, that one tiny shot cost more than the entire margarita and it was only house tequila, which just tells me how little tequila was actually in the drink. OK, on to  my next complaint. I had a combo plate which included a chicken taco and enchilada, rice and beans. The taco shell was a pre-formed shell similar to Taco Bell's cheapest dollar menu taco, except Taco Bell adds way more filling, this taco was so measly, at least El Torito fries their own shells, it was ridiculous. 

The other complaint with my meal was presentation. It seemed just slapped together, the rice came on my plate, but the re-fried beans came in a little dish on the side. There was no shredded lettuce or guacamole or sour cream, nothing, just blah. My husband had the same complaint with his meal, average taste, like a chain restaurant, but nothing else on the plate. My last complaint is that they don't serve complimentary chips and salsa. That's usually a given at Mexican restaurants, but not this place. We  are members of Landry's select club and all Golden Nuggett restaurants are included, so when you dine at one they send you a survey to complete and I didn't exactly give rave reviews, but I'm being honest, presentation is everything when the food is mediocre. Well apparently the manager saw my review and chose to phone me at 8AM that next morning to find out why, the only problem was that we were on vacation and obviously stayed out very late the night before because its Las Vegas, so when the blasting cell rang, I jumped out of bed and basically blasted the manager for calling me so early. Needless to say he was sorry and said he would phone me back later, but never did. I should have called him back to explain, but I just let it go. Well this is my review and I really wish I had something better to say."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant! Our waitress was so happy and on top of everything! She was always checking on us and making sure we had what we needed/wanted! I wish I remembered her name! I will be back to update this later! 

The food was amazing and the pricing was surprisingly great! With being in the Golden Nugget and all, I thought the prices would be a little high, but not at all! The Margaritas alone are worth going back for! ;)

We will be eating here again in the near future!!!"}
{"text":"We dined here twice during our three day visit. Food was very good, and the bar had a great atmosphere! Kudos!"}
{"text":"Good food, little pricy. Great happy hour. Meh on the house margaritas, really acidic. 
If I stay at the Golden Nugg again i drop in for a beer and guac for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent food, price is very reasonable and service is great. what more can you ask for? My wife is vegetarian and they were very accommodating, made a veggie chile relleno which even I envy with my chicken enchiladas. Their corn melted in mouth and habanero sauce with slight fruit flavor was the highlight of all. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Mexican burger was bomb !!!!! it has bacon ,avocado ,churros, lettuce,tomato , and jalapeños . The price at this location a little expensive that's why I went with the burger . Drinks at this bar are not strong in alcohol . I order vodka and sprite. All I can taste was the soda."}
{"text":"Really good tequila!! Loved the atmosphere and the service! The nachos are awesome and the shrimp salad is to die for! Also the Cozumel plate is delicious!! It has crab meat that melts in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Don't ever come to this place!! There racists they kick me and my family out the service is really bad"}
{"text":"So Good!  Best mixed drink I had ever had!  Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the combination of good, mexican foods (and large quantities!) combined with a sportsbar. The bar always seemed to be full with people, but the staff was always fast and responsive. 

The decor is great: lots of glass walls with Tequila bottles in them, and comfy sofas to wit and enjoy your food and drinks. Talking about drinks: the cocktails here are also very good and large!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican restaurant inside the Golden Nugget.  Pretty decent collection of tequila.  I'd stick with the Tapas and try a few different things like the Ahi Tacos and chicken soft tacos."}
{"text":"Very prejudiced.  We're Mexican and got treated bad. Chola ass waitress treat us bad. You should be white in order to come to this \"Mexican \" bar."}
{"text":"I can seriously enjoy a place that is decorated in tequila. It's a place to go for good quality Mexican food and drink (if you don't mind the prices) and to people-watch. I felt their Cadillac margarita was made well and reasonably priced (I was suspicious of the cheaper house margarita because it did not include the words \"lime juice\" in the description, so I guessed it may have been a mix). The nachos were some of the best I've had in a while, particularly because of the cheese, though I was a bit disappointed that the jalapenos were a mix of fresh and canned. The fish tacos were pretty good too. Service can be a bit slow when they're busy, so be prepared to nurse your drink while waiting for your food or that next drink."}
{"text":"Good service and food was DELICIOUS. I had the chicken enchiladas the sauce was so rich and flavorful. Beans and rice were great, the peach margarita was good. I was pleasantly surprised. Golden nugget has such high standards of food at all of their restaurants. A depth of flavor is missing at so many restaurants but not this one. Service was quick and friendly as well."}
{"text":"MUY RICO!!!! Located in the Golden Nugget this Mexican Cantina is fantastic! We usually come in for the happy hour drinks, but order from the main menu. On happy hour you can get beers for $3-4 and margaritas for $4!! I recommend the peach margarita. Very tasty! And if fruit flavored isn't you style they can do drinks on the rocks or frozen as well. 

Also on the happy hour menu is a combo plate of salsa, guac, and queso. The queso is the star here and reminds me of my time spent in Austin, TX. It is not too runny, nor too gooey, but a perfect texture that sticks your chips. It is also not too spicy, but provides enough heat to be memorable. I can also recommend the quesadilla and the taco's. The quesadilla is a bit small, but enough to share with another person. And the tacos are similar to small street tacos, and can be ordered with chicken, steak, or carnitas. 

My favorite dish here is the Rellano de Camaron. This is a roasted poblano pepper stuffed with shrimp, onion, cilantro, salsa, and cheese. I get this every time I go and would highly recommend this. The pairing of the pepper with the shrimp is perfect!! We have also tried the fajitas and the Tacos al Carbon- which are fajita style chicken already placed into tacos for you. The Fajitas come out on a steaming hot plate and served over a bed of onions. The smell is amazing!

If you like Elote (street corn) then order it here. My wife can't get enough! Super authentic! 

If it is your first time here I would start with the happy hour. You get a better deal on drinks but you can still order from the main menu."}
{"text":"Man I love this place. They have the BEST virgin margaritas I have ever had. NOWHERE seems to know how to get something that is so simple correct. I am so glad I live far from it. Otherwise I'd be like Norm from Cheers,  'Everyone knows my name.\"
It does get hectic and can be a zoo. But I'll wait to get a sip of these delights. Makes my mouth happy! 

Oh and the food is great too. I love the chicken quesadillas and a friend said the new mexican tacos were delish too."}
{"text":"As a whole, this restaurant is pretty darn good. Food was good. Drinks were good. Happy hour is not bad. Decently priced, over all. For 5 margaritas and chicken nachos the price was $30. Not bad at all. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Love their homemade chips and salsa.  Their cheese enchiladas, beans and rice were delicious too!"}
{"text":"Came back a couple days ago 6/28/18 and had an excellent server. Had the Mexicana burger which was phenomenal as usual, the Camerone rellano, and the Elote! So good once again and the service was on point.

Update from my previous review. Our server Edna was very sweet and wrote everything down correctly. Service has definitely gotten much better.  Truly Edna is a keeper. 

I want to give service. 5 star rating but food has changed.

So bartender gets a no salt order and makes with salt. I get it, it happens.

The Relleno de Camerones is not like it used to be. I will not order it again. It came out somewhat warm and the poblano pepper was not roasted enough so it tasted raw. I am certain the staff at night rushes the food verses making it to standard. I know that Edna rang in no rice, it came out with it. No biggie I just pushed off the plate, but the Relleno failed to the outstanding taste it used to have :-(."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times over the last few years. It's definitely one of the better food spots in the Freemont St area. Located in the Golden Nugget, but away from the casino and the smoke is a plus.

The food never disappoints - everything is always fresh, hot and delicious. The service, however, has a bit more room for improvement. Each time I've been here the servers have been slow. They are friendly and helpful - but slow.

My last visit was just a few weeks ago for a girlfriend's birthday. We ordered two sodas and our meals.. and it literally took about 15 mins for the waitress to bring our sodas. The food was great.. but when the server finally came back to check on us - she noticed we needed refills and said she'd be right back. However, she got side tracked chatting with the hostess and completely forgot about us. Eventually she brought us our check and commented, \"Oh! I forgot your refills.\" Yep.... *sigh*

Nothing major.. nothing that would keep me from coming back.. just be warned.  ;)"}
{"text":"We just checked in today and got in just in time for their killer happy hour! We got several margaritas on the rocks, beef nachos, ahi tuna tacos, carnitas street tacos, and carnitas quesadillas. All came to the table in a timely manner and everything tasted great and fresh! I only gave 4 stars because I personally hate sports and grown men screaming in my ear! But other than that this place is a definite win, especially if you're staying at the GN!"}
{"text":"Good place to enjoy football! I really liked the fish tacos, and my friend raved about her burger. The service was lacking -  more than the crowd warranted - and that's the reason for the mediocre rating. We sat with empty glasses more often than not."}
{"text":"Any time we travel to Vegas this spot is a must! They definitely have there own flare and it is always bommmb! Can't beat the price or portions, now only if there staff was a bit more friendly!"}
{"text":"The Cadillac Mex Kitchen & Tequila Bar was only about a half of a mile from our hotel, and since the reviews were decent, my wife and I thought we would give it a try. I'm so glad we did!! I will definitely visit this restaurant again when we go back to LV next. Since we arrived earlier than most do for dinner, parking was easy, we were greeted and seated quickly, and our friendly and courteous server was prompt and attentive throughout our stay. Prior to enjoying our meal, we 'washed-up' and we were both pleased to see that the restroom was clean and fully stocked.I got the chicken & shrimp fajitas and my wife got a tacos al carbon. First things first- The service was excellent, and our server DANA constantly had a smile for us. They have a yummy lv chips & the extra fresh roasted tomato dip is quite tasty. Also, the chips were good too- but I found myself hunting for the ones that had the seasoning because without it they were not nearly as amazing. When our dishes came, I was shocked at the portion sizes! Sheesh! I was sort of bummed that I had crammed so many chips in before the plates got there because there was no way I could finish the meal! The chicken & shrimp fajitas were really good- but I did need to salt them a bit. The rice and beans were excellent- I took those home and enjoyed them later + i added tacos to go for late night cravings! I would definitely recommend this restaurant. All in all had a great meal."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!!  Great friends and the sangria is so yummy!  Caution:  chips and salsa are pricey.., so avoid them,  Secondly---Be sure to stay away from Jennifer the server as she is extremely rude & beyond snotty...,, (this was our third run in with her-- three strikes and your out!!) .,,,so we opted to change severs and Renee took excellent care of us!!!  Thank you Renee you are awesome! 
As for the food be sure to order the carnitas guadilaria (sp) ..,, super yummy!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar. Ordered the nachos. They were good. Nothing to brag about. The Cadillac punch comes in a cute cup but it is very very weak. The peach margarita is not good. The flavor is yuck. Nothing like peach. The service is friendly ( the female bartender, the male bartender and the two people that brought our food out from the kitchen)."}
{"text":"I had the chicken tacos and admittedly they were what I needed the whole time I was visiting Vegas. The Mexican rice was delicious! I'd definitely eat here aging if I find myself back on Freemont St."}
{"text":"a few of us decided to stop here for some food before going out. We were seated right away and a server came over in a decent amount of time. She seemed pissed when we tried to order food and drinks at the same time. it took forever to get the drinks and the food came out almost right after the drinks. Several times we had to go to the hostess and ask for out server. The food was nothing special and with this bad of service there is not a planned return in the near future."}
{"text":"Excellent Carnitas!!! Cool atmosphere!  Highly recommend this place.  Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Pork quesadillas DELISH!!! Rum & pinapple, tasty but had to add an extra shot to get my buzz. TV'S to watch sports and nice table and bar set up. At happy hr so prices are NICE. Bartender really nice and personable."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Golden Nugget and asked where is the best Mexican food, of course they said the Cadillac Bar. We went down during Happy Hour which was the best part. We hit happy hour everyday we were staying there because you cant beat $4.00 margarita's or sangria's. They were great drinks. You could actually taste the liquor. As for the food, well not so much. I had the nacho's and I wasn't very impressed. It was a very small order I thought for nacho's. More cheese then anything. My man got the pork taco's which he liked but they were the tiniest taco's I had ever seen. One bite and they were gone basically. Left feeling good because of the drinks but still hungry. They also charge for chips and salsa. I guess I'm used to complimentary chips and salsa from our neck of the woods. Service was fast and for the price it was alright. We didn't eat there again but like I said we returned just for the happy hour drinks."}
{"text":"Popped in after a concert on a Saturday night. The food is so good. Chips, guacamole, salsa verde were all very fresh and tasty. Fajitas and mahi mahi tacos were delicious. Service was incredible. Joanna, our server was absolutely the best. She kept our drinks topped off and checked on us often. The place was very busy, too. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Me and my family just ate at this restaurant. We see it immediately after entering the Golden Nugget from the parking garage. We went to yelp to read reviews, and seeing the poor ratings of the nearby sushi place, we went to this place with a solid 4 star rating. 

This is the best choice I have ever made.

We sat down, and we're promptly greeted by our very fast and patient server, named Brianna. I ordered us the chips with salsa and guacamole. I have always hated guac, and refuse avacado laced foods. Today however, I enjoyed a good portion of their guac. But I am a true salsa fan, and their chipotle dipping salsa exceeded all expectations. Pleasingly spicy, and very hearty and fresh. Their excellent chips and dip appetizer can not be over stated, and they arrived as quickly as our drinks. 

The tacos we ordered were excellent. We had the tuna tacos, which were excellent (once we removed the ginger, personal preference). I had the carnitas tacos myself, and found the salsa served with it to be a perfect medium salsa heat, a truly excellent taco experience. 

And just when I thought it was over,, I inquired of dessert. Of which I was told they had only one thing. She described them as some sort of sweet puff, so I said sure and ordered it. Surely if they have only one dessert, it must be both very fresh and great tasting.

My guess was rewarded by the best Mexican dessert I've ever had. I can only describe it as sweet pita bread, coated in sugar like a churro. Served with whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and a sliced up strawberry. This dessert found its way into the hands of everyone who assured me they were full before. 

This was an excellent experience, fully deserving of a 5 star rating. Will be thinking of this next time I'm here."}
{"text":"We came hear for dinner and returned the next day for breakfast. The MLB playoffs were going on so we wanted to see the games and they have lots of TV's all over the place. 

The first night we were there we took advantage of their Happy Hour. We all were hungry so we all had some of their offerings. I had the chicken nachos and they were very good. My wife and daughter ordered the Queso fundido and some tacos and they were both happy. The Queso is really really good. I had their vodka tonic Happy Hour offering and it was under $7. 

The next day the girls went shopping and we wanted to catch a game so we came back to the Cadillac where I had the breakfast tacos and a bloody Mary. The tacos were very tasty and it stated that they had potatoes so I was worried that it would be full of potatoes and little of anything else. No worries since the was very little potatoes, just enough to give you a taste."}
{"text":"This place is right in the Golden Nugget where  we were staying. We arrived from our travels to Las Vegas and we're pretty hungry. This is the first place we passed after we checked in. I have to say the food was very good. I had the Cadillac Mexican burger and my wife had tacos. Food quality was very good and the service was definitely top-notch. I just talk to a single store because they did not have a lunch menu and only a dinner menu. The dinner items are just a bit too much in price and size for the average person just wanting a simple lunch."}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING! It's so much better than most of the other places I've been to here in Vegas.  They have really nice drinks and a huge selection of tequila if thats your thing...but the queso is the best ever!!"}
{"text":"The best steak fajitas in town!! The carmelized onions are amazing as is the wait staff is friendly. This place is in the golden nugget by the pool and reasonably priced also. A must try if you go to Fremont street"}
{"text":"My husband and I loved this place so much that we came here twice while staying in Vegas. It is conveniently located in the Golden Nugget and has more of upscale bar feel to it. 

Both times we split appetizers which had large portions. We had the chips with salsa & queso and a chicken quesadilla. As far as cocktails, we enjoyed their house margaritas and Vegas tea. We did order their 45 oz Cadillac Punch which tasted good but at $20, we thought we would have at least gotten a buzz. It's very fruity and not strong at all."}
{"text":"During our weeklong stay in Vegas, we found ourselves at Cadillac Mexican Kitchen on several occasions due to its easy proximity and amazing Happy Hour menu.

This is a joint, after all, that offers pints of decent beers for $3 (!!!) between 4:00 and 7:00 Monday to Friday. I mean, who can resist that?

So we tried the Cantina Beef Nachos (\"Cheddar cheese and chips with spicy beef, refried 
beans, jalapeños, pico de gallo and guacamole\") and I'll admit these are much better than your typical cheap nachos. The cheese is plentiful, while the spicy beef and other toppings are generously peppered throughout. The dish is maybe not quite as heavy on the nachos as one might've liked - we would often wipe out the entire plate in less than five minutes - but you just can't go wrong with the $6.99 price tag.

We also tried the Cantina Chicken Nachos (\"Monterey Jack cheese and chips with grilled 
chicken, refried beans, jalapeños, pico de gallo and guacamole\") and they too were quite tasty, although I'm not sure how well the Monterey Jack cheese worked. (Cheddar seems like a better option.)

The service was admittedly not the best - it would take a while for the waitress to make her presence known, which got frustrating when one was waiting to order another cheap beer - but overall I'd say this is a decent joint that I'd visit quite often if I lived in Vegas."}
{"text":"I had the hamburger.   Not a typical Mexican dish but was craving one.  It was actually very good!  The location is past the pool in the Golden Nugget,  atmosphere is casual lade back with a sports bar feel.  You can relax and watch the world buzz past you.  Great price on margs; $4.00.  Waitress was very sweet."}
{"text":"Excellent place for drinks! They sell $19 pitchers that give you a liter of margaritas. The bartender was a white man who took care of us. An excellent gentleman! I had such an amazing time. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food great service fun environment inside the Golden Nugget. Not a long wait to be sat, waitress was always a step ahead. Would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I normally don't do reviews because well..  I'm just too lazy...  however this is by far the best food we've had here in Vegas yet! My husband and I are visiting for the weekend from Texas (sooo we are fairly picky about our Mexican food). My husband had the tacos el carbon and I had the beef enchiladas for lunch and both were great! Super friendly staff, especially Ayla behind the bar! Would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Not much good to say about this place. 

House margaritas - tasted like diet lemonade and cheap tequila (and not much of it). 

Patron Perfecto - this was closer to the mark. Still a little light on the liquor. 

Chips and:
Guac- bland
Salsa - too ketchupy 
Cheese - can you say velveeta?

Nachos - hamburger meat, need I say more?

By far the worst Mexican food I've had in a long time, and the worst food I've had in Vegas ever I think. Service was good although a little on the slow side from the bar."}
{"text":"Great food and great value (especially if you like cheese!).  Got a seat right away and guacamole and chips were at the table within minutes.  Wait staff very friendly and attentive.  Would recommend.  Fun place"}
{"text":"We ate lunch here on Super Bowl weekend.  As soon as we walked into the restaurant, we were approached by staff.  They were energetic and definitely made you feel welcome.  Even for a busy weekend, we received our drinks and food quickly.  We had their breakfast tacos and they did not disappoint.  Being from Texas, I thought that I would not care for the hot sauce but boy was I wrong.  It was spicy and flavorful.  This was a great way to start our Super Bowl Sunday!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is actually pretty good for being in a casino. I loved the loungey type feel of this place with the couches. Yes, some people have said it's kind of funky trying to eat but it's not too bad!! Tons of TV's to watch sports and they make a yummy mojito and they have tons of tequila too (obviously). We had chips and guac and chicken quesadillas and wow they had a kick to them! But it was very good and hit the spot after you have been in the pool all day. Our server was okay. Not the best but not too bad either. Price is a little high but it's to be expected for Vegas.

But, all in all, I think this is a great place to come with your buds (no kids) and watch the game and have some drinks and apps. Glad this is at the Golden Nugget now!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a beer and watch the game! Fast Service!"}
{"text":"Very good food, relaxing atmosphere. This place is great for sports fans. A little pricey but it is Vegas!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me and booked a flight to Vegas for my birthday! We love staying in downtown because it's cheaper and it's more fun to gamble and the payout for blackjack is better. We are not the club going couple so what we do in Vegas is eat, sleep, gamble, and I drink. We decided to have a late lunch here after we dropped off our bags to the room. 

We kinda sat ourselves. And then one girl came up and said she was our server but, then another girl came and was our server. It wasn't busy, the service was slow. 

We ordered an appetizer of the chorizo queso. Came with  warm flour tortillas. Anyways, it's like a block of melted cheese. It wasn't terrible but, it was hard to eat. 

I ordered steak and shrimp fajitas and they brought me chicken and shrimp. I let our server know and they brought a side of the steak. The steak was over cooked and lacked flavor. To be honest, the chicken was better so I'm glad they didn't take it away from me. My boyfriend ordered the seafood enchiladas. It was ehh. It's definitely not Javier's seafood enchiladas! 

The service was slow, the food was mediocre at best. I wouldn't eat here again. I rather go to the Claim Jumper in the Golden Nugget lol"}
{"text":"During a recent stay at the Golden Nugget wanted to watch the game while eating, so decided on the Cadillac Mexican Kitchen since they have lots of nice tv's and comfy couch seats. I thought the service was great, from the hostess greeting me as I entered to the attentive bartender that checked in regularly to see if I needed anything else!  As for the food I thought it was alright but just did not match the excellent service.  The real disappointment was with the margaritas I had.  I ordered the house margarita on the rocks with salt but found them to be too sweet with not enough tequila!   So based on the great service and relaxed seating would return if I am just after appetizers and to catch a game, but if out for dinner will probably head to one of the many other excellent Mexican restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had amazing service by Anya. The food was amazing. Steak fajitas had a nice mesquite flavor to them. The chips and salsa came with a nice warm salsa. All around good spot. We would definitely come back. Huge tequila selection."}
{"text":"The service and food was so amazing, I got the Mexicano burger with chorizo.  The waitress was on point with service. I had a sin city amber beer and it had amazing flavor. I will totally be going back when I'm in Vegas again."}
{"text":"We went in for a late lunch after checking in. Seating is either at a high table or on a couch.  We wanted to eat so we wanted a table and I hate high tables but I didn't want to try to eat on a couch.  

My husband had cheese enchiladas topped with chili - he was thinking there would be a decent amount of chili on them but it was more of a chili flavored enchilada sauce.  I got tacos made with fajita chicken, each one had 2 narrow pieces of chicken (very little) in a flour tortilla.  I also got a tiny 2 inch piece of corn on the cob which was very good but tiny.  Overall the food tasted quite good but servings were small, especially for the cost.  

We stayed for Happy Hour where you can get a 16oz Bud Light or Sin City Amber for $3.  The Amber was really good."}
{"text":"Went there for drinks last night before the show. They charged me $ 39.00 for 2 martinis.
As a local who has lived here for over 20 years, that's a total rip off. Robbery actually,
And it was happy hour.....
Do not drink there."}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner. The atmosphere was stylish and cool looking and while the lounge couches and little tables may look hip they are super annoying to try and eat at. The tables are so low you're practically bending over at the waste to eat.

The food was great. It was upscale/hipster Mexican food. The service was terrible. 

First, I asked for a glass of wine and some water and they brought out my partner's drink but not mine. When I asked another waitress about it, our waitress came up behind her and was kind of snarky about it. Um, it's not my fault, so don't be rude.

Second, my cousin ordered a glass of sangria and not only was it terrible, they charged her $14 for it instead of $6 like the menu says. When she questioned the waitress she got super rude about it. In the end the manager adjusted the price but it left a negative impression on both of us.

Terrible service. Food is good though."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed!  The food was ok.  The ambiance is nice.  There won't be any return visits"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant having an identity crisis if there ever were one.  It's a Mexican (food) restaurant with the TV's of a sports bar, night club tables and chairs to ensure eating is uncomfortable and blaring classic rock (when I was there).  Service was also poor, but it was mid-afternoon on a Monday so perhaps I just hit it at a bad time.

Anyway, we'll go through all of the above one item at a time.

Food: my party of five had fajitas, tacos, enchiladas, and wings.  Two people in the party wanted burritos, but this Mexican restaurant has no burritos.... huh?  The food that they do serve was not bad; Americanized 'Mexican' but it was pretty reasonable in portions, taste and price.  Everyone was satisfied.  The chips and salsa were the highlight though; they had several options and the chips were hot.  Those stand out in my memory more than the run of the mill food.

Seating: there is one high top, you should fight for it if you want to eat.  The rest of the place are low couches surrounding low tables so everyone can awkwardly hunch over to eat and spill things everywhere.  It's like they had some leftover night club seating so decided to re-use it.

TV's:  they are everywhere.  There is also a sports news and scores ticker that runs the length of the place.  I guess they figure everyone in Vegas wants sports scores 24x7 so they did their best to make it look like a sports book.

Music: nope, not Mexican, it was best of the 70's and 80's classic rock when we were there.

BOOZE!!  Tried their original margarita, cadillac margarita and barrel aged margarita.  All were pretty light on the tequila and pretty heavy on the mixers.  We all gave up on trying to get drunk off their margaritas or we'd have ended up in a diabetic seizure.  The \"Vegas Tea\", which is really just a long island with a dumb name, is much better.  It's a pretty large glass of reasonably strong long island; we were all happy with those.

The place could really improve if it switched to music that matched the theme, pour the margaritas properly (use Hussong's Cantina at Mandalay as an example) and added burritos.  Seating, whatever, is what it is and I'll eat and booze somewhere I like regardless of seating."}
{"text":"Located inside the Golden Nugget casino, this is a trendy Mexican restaurant serving some upscale type Mexican food. I would say the food quality was average, as compared to authentic Mexican restaurants. Also the entree serving sizes were small for the price. The best part of the meal was the nachos. They were very cheesy with loads of toppings,  I would recommend these. I tried the Mexican chicken salad, this was tasty but I was not blown away.  The Mango margarita is a great flavor choice here, and they do also have an extra large margarita with a beer served upside down in it (if that's your thing). The margaritas tasted like they used bar mix instead of freshly squeezed lime juice."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour from 4pm to 7pm. Great atmosphere to watch football. Food is delicious and great customer service."}
{"text":"Lunch and service here are top notch. The chef came out to personally explain menu items to accommodate my food allergies. He ended up completely customizing the dish, and it was amazing. Best ahi tacos I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Great food and good tequila bar. The seafood enchiladas are delicious. Good selection of entrees and beverages."}
{"text":"Really nice vibe! Yummy food! Fajitas Nachos were so yummy! Price wise it was ok to appetizers and one drink $40 I guess that's cool lol the nachos atmosphere were worth it for a last minute bite to eat!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Golden Nugget and I decided to have Mexican for lunch.  Ordered the 3 mini chicken tacos and chips & salsa with a Coke.  Chips and salsa aren't complimentary at this Mexican restaurant.  Chicken tacos were awesome, wonderful flavor, but together amounted to 1 1/2 regular size tacos.  Salsa was served hot...as in temperature, not heat/spice hot.  I ordered the mild salsa and there was not much flavor in my opinion.   Ample amount of chips and salsa, enough to take back to the room.

$19.99 before tip - very expensive for the amount of food!!"}
{"text":"Very accommodating to vegans. Just wish they'd have vegan beans in the menu so it was open and available to even those who don't ask."}
{"text":"This Mexican restaurant is located in the golden nugget hotel. There are two style of seating options available, the high top and the lounge type seating. Lots of TV playing sports. We started with the chips salsa and guacamole. This was very good, tradition chili salsa and very delish guacamole. My husband, myself and my daughter we dinning. We were able to order a side of rice and chicken for my 8 year old. My husband had the beef enchilada and I had the maricos ( shrimp and crab tossed with tomatoes and avocado with a butter sauce) super yummy but had a little spice. Overall our experience was great and out waiting was on it. Dishes are moderately price between $13-20."}
{"text":"If you're at the Nugget this place is in Carson Tower. I know its a chain, but the food and the service are first rate. Plus if you like Tequila then you'll be right at home here. 

So our group was in town for CES 18 and we stayed at the Nugget. We stopped in to watch the College Football National title game. 

Dana was our server and hooked us up nicely with happy hour eats and drinks. The street tacos are da bom as is the queso fundido - its got chorizo too!  

I got a sangria swirl- okay stop laughing - it was great. I know because I ended up having a couple more!  

One of our folks got this humonculous punch drink in a container you get to keep. As he was working thru it he commented that it tasted like mostly juice. When we decidedly it needed a kick like a shot of Cuervo Gold, I promised I'd get one too. Its a lotta stuff! But good. 

We had a mixup on our dinner orders and ended up ordering more street tacos than we thought. No problem we finished them but instead of four, we got eight!  Whew. 

Dana was solid and very attentive. We also got a visit from Katrina the manager. Just great attention and super personalized service. 

This is definitely a stop for the team when here!"}
{"text":"We went twice on our last trip. The elote asado was my highlight --so so good. Tangy, sweet, spicy. 

Drinks were great. Meals were good too. I had tacos and a rellano stuffed with shrimp.  All were tasty.  The Spanish rice that comes on the side was perfect!  

This is also a good sports spot.  Lots of TVs and a scrolling headline LED update board. We went on a college football Saturday and it was great."}
{"text":"A big group of us went here for our friend's birthday. The place was a bit smokey. Our server wasn't the most pleasant person I've ever met.

We ordered chips and salsa to hold us over. They were marginal. I got a strawberry margarita - absolute waste of calories! Machine margaritas FTL! They have burgers, tacos, enchiladas and salad on the menu. The servings are small since they're tapas. I did like the Ahi Tacos - you can get them either soft or hard. What's strange though is that the tacos had more of a Japanese taste to it than Mexican because of the sesame seeds and pickled ginger.

There are so many other Mexican restaurants in Vegas. Go there instead."}
{"text":"To be totally honest, our server was a total bitch. She was extremely unpleasant, not to mention she was snappy and rude. We asked what kind of tequilas she had and she literally  said \"I don't know\". She was extremely rude, and as a a local,  I will never come back."}
{"text":"The Ahi tacos in a wonton Tortola shells were fresh and delish ! I recommend the happy hour 4-7:00pm .
The chicken and pork quesadillas so good! Located inside the golden nugget casino ,  & margaritas were perfect.

{"text":"This was a very welcome surprise we were not expecting much thought it was pretty much a bar til we ordered food and. All of us were raving about our food. The wait staff is super friendly and they all really get along well with each other. The manager was really nice checking on us and making sure we were happy. Our waitress was awesome so sweet. We liked it so much we went back the next day with 6 more friends for another great lunch. I will come here again next time in Vegas"}
{"text":"We ended our bar hopping night here. I don't know why, but we just did. After a night strolling around Fremont street, we landed at the Golden Nugget's pool lounge chairs staring at the fish tank. I wanted to relax and chill so twas a perfect place.to do such. 

I began craving a margarita and with Cadillac conveniently located to the right of the pool's main door entrance, why not. 

We were.immediately greeted by our hostess turned waitress. She offered us a table.or the couches. We opted for the couches. We knew we weren't getting anything serious since we were spending hours of drinking here and there.

The couches are.seated right at the entrance so it wasn't much of a walk in. The place itself was very dark, however, their walls lined of flat screens and tickers which helps illuminate the restaurant. It isn't a big place at all. Somehow I memorized their maximum seating capacity is 137. When we were there around 9pm, there was a good amount of people eating and drinking at their bar. Mostly depressed looking couples  with the exception of us. Lol. 

I had their Cadillac Margarita which is the one served with the 1800 tequila. We also ordered just the chips and salsa. The chips were way better than the salsa as the salsa had no flavor. Seriously. I've never had bland salsa in my life until this night. Twas 5.99 for that and 10 bucks for my small.glass of margarita. The bartender definitely made the tequila evident in my drink, but at 10bucks...I would've been able to enjoy a bigger glass that wouldve last me longer at the same quality elsewhere. 

Perhaps that's why everyone looked depressed. If the salsa is a sample.of what their food may taste like...I'd look depressed too. Even our waitress didn't seem too enthusiastic. I usually advise anyone to give a place a try,but there are sooooo many options in the vicinity...I'd say skip it. Sorry. =S"}
{"text":"I would like to give them place a review I was eating there and I had the best server that u can have . Her name was Daniel was very nice she refilled my water on the spot. I sat at table 48 she was great I looking forward to going back there and watching some basketball game good location. And better food"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were amazing. As always. Brianna was our server and  she was on point with her recommendations and service. All around A great experience."}
{"text":"For our first meal on our first foray into Fremont Street, we stopped at Cadillac Mexican Kitchen, situated in the Golden Nugget hotel. We were a bit early for lunch so we waited while they finished setting up and got seated pretty much at 11am on the nose. 

We ordered quickly with my partner choosing the chicken fajitas and I requesting cheese enchiladas with a red sauce of some kind. We also each ordered a specialty margarita as there were several interesting flavours kinds available! Sizzling fajitas came out quick and my enchiladas arrived with beans and rice on the side as well, so there was definitely a lot of food to go around. 

The margaritas were delicious and strong, the food was delicious, and holy geez, the sauce was SPICY. It was a lot hotter than I was expecting, and I honestly can't remember if I'd specified the heat level, but never have I encountered enchilada sauce that hot before! I managed to work my way through most of it, but I did chug my way through the tequila pretty quick. 

It was a pretty good lunch and we had no complaints. Service was fast and it was what we were looking for after just arriving at Fremont, being slightly delicate after a day of hangover recovery and needing some good solid food to get started on exploring the less fancy side of Vegas. The price is a bit more on the upper end of Fremont prices but well within reason if you're coming from the Strip."}
{"text":"I was walking down Fremont street in Vegas and in the Golden Nugget found this hidden gem.  Outstanding Mexican food, a pool view of sweet looking people, and Margaritas to die for!  I highly recommend this joint!"}
{"text":"My partner and i are staying In the Golden Nugget and have been very impressed with the service and quality of food at the Cadillac Mexican kitchen and tequila bar.  Edna and Binay  and even the chef Raul have gone above and beyond to meet my dietary restrictions and deliver exceptional food and service .   We have now eaten here twice since getting here and the food is amazing .  Some of the best salsa I've ever had and I'm Mexican !  Keep up the good work !"}
{"text":"Can people stop bringing their kids to bars? For real, there was a gaggle of 5 girls under the age of 13 and a GIANT baby stroller with a baby crawling on the seats of this bar when Ife A. and I went here for dinner on 6/13/14. Unfortunately they came in and were seated after we were already here.

So let me just get this out of the way, a sports bar, with few actual tables, and seating more like a night club, is NO place for kids. I don't care if it's 7 PM, get your kids out of this bar. And bar owners, do not let kids into this place. Some places aren't kid friendly, and your customers don't want to be surrounded by a gaggle of kids. 

This place is SO loud you have to scream to have a conversation because TVs line the perimeter of this place. Food, is just whatever. I had the tortilla soup, Ife had some sort of expensive enchiladas that she said weren't good. My soup was fine, but it was simply a bowl of soup for $7. 

There's no chips, no extras whatsoever which I find strange for a bar. Chips and salsa is $4. Don't they want you to eat salty foods to get you thirsty so you'll buy more drinks? Am I the only one who has heard of this tactic is the food industry? Ugh.

I told Ife that I felt like I was eating on my couch because you have to either hold your food in your lap or awkwardly eat over a coffee table.

The fact that there was a parade of kids in this place totally turned me off from coming here again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner.  Had the chicken & shrimp fajita.  Portion was smaller than the average Mexican restaurant but was one of the best fajitas I ever had.  My companion had the ahi tuna tacos and loved them.  Sangria not the greatest I ever had, but ambiance was nice, excellent spot to watch all sports/games, service by Ruby was great!"}
{"text":"We were exploring Fremont Street one night and decided to grab some food. Decided on Cadillac while walking through the Golden Nugget. The margaritas weren't all that good, so we ordered beer for the rest of the meal. Service was good, and the queso we ordered came out quickly. We ended up ordering chicken fajitas and split them between the two of us. Everything tastes alright, and our waitress was very attentive."}
{"text":"This review is from a stay at the Golden Nugget during Spring Break in March 2018. We waited 20 minutes to order drinks while the waitress ignored us and took orders from people that arrived after us. I got her attention and said we hadn't been helped and she walked right by me. We decided to order our food from the bartender. She was really cool about it and the drinks and appetizer were really tasty. The waitress just walked by us again, though. She missed out on the nice tip we gave the bartender."}
{"text":"I liked it. Sat at the bar which had a couple of seats immediately available which was great. Our bartender was more like a guide explaining when the restaurant opened and the different options. It really turned our weekend's experiences around as we had pretty bad food in Downtown that weekend. 

Chicken tortilla soup was really good. I asked for no cheese,  but it still came out with some. It didn't ruin it though. Margaritas were good too."}
{"text":"This place is really pretty good. You have to remember this is americanized mexican food in a casino but they do a pretty good job. Margaritas are very good, nachos were great & they offer o \"to-go\" window. I would not hesitate at all to stop in here next trip."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday football while we were staying in the Golden Nugget for Life is Beautiful. The squad and I were lucky enough to get 4 bar seats since it was super busy. Though it was busy and the Niners got their butts beat by the Seahawks, the service from our bartender/server was amazing. The prices are typical hotel resteraunt prices, but it wasn't too bad for what they had going for them.
To drink I ended up getting a Cadillac margarita and the barrel aged tequila. Both were deliciously crafted and definitely on the stronger side. Everything looked delicious on the menu, but I ended up going for the Mexican burger. This monster of a burger comes with a beef patty, chorizo, bacon, roasted peppers, onions, jalapeño cheese, lettuce, avocado, pico de gallo, chipotle mayonnaise a side of steak fries. DELICIOUSLY EPIC BURGER!!! Seriously one of my favorite burgers ever! Overall, if you're in Downtown Vegas you must check out their drinks and food, but especially the burger."}
