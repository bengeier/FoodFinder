{"text":"Great food, my family enjoyed it. Try the platters, for sure"}
{"text":"Went there with my brother for lunch and ordered from the menu. I was really excited to see the south indian dishes on the menu. We ordered the set dosa, chilli paratha, iral curry, roti and lacha paratha. Everything was very delicious.. Roti was one of the best I've ever had. Set dosa was yumm & Iral curry was spicy and flavourful! Chilli paratha was good but never had crispy like that before. Overall, we had a very satisfying South Indian lunch!   Service was good too but just felt that the waitress needs a little bit more training on the menu! Everything was great and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place hasn't been opened too long but the foods is pretty tasty.  They sell sets dosas which are like uttapam or lentil pancakes.  The vada curry was delicious, i could easily eat a second bowl of it.  The poori masala was a hit, soft creamy spiced potatoes served with poori cooked just right and not greasy."}
{"text":"I had dined at this restaurant about a month ago with friends.  Food is very tasty- I was quite excited to see South Indian offerings.  We tried many of the dishes- crab, gifts of the sea curry, chicken tiktak.  The kids enjoyed the mildness of the chicken and the seafood curry and crab crab curry was well balanced.  Today, l returned and we had the mutton in gravy, pomfret fried fish with lemon rice and a dhosa.  My dad enjoyed the mutton with his dhosa and l loved the different coconut chutneys that accompanied the dhosa. The lemon rice was studded with various fried dals and tangy and was the perfect foil for the pomfret. I did wish the pomfret was spicier but it was fried well.  I would gladly return as this place has delicious food. They do have a lunch buffet during the week and although small, offers a satisfying selection of delicious South Indian fare."}
{"text":"Curry leaf buffet is limited but whatever dishes are included in the buffet are fantastic. Love their lamb biryani. Friendly customer service. Would highly recommend this for Indian food."}
{"text":"We went to The Curry Leaf 'cos of the Taste of Calgary.  We had tasted their Chicken Biryani and their Butter Chicken Quiche.  They were both good.  While we were there, we were enticed by the owner of the restaurant who \"sold\" the wares at the restaurant.  We were intrigued when he said \"Crab Curry\"!!    Off we went to try their lunch buffet on Sunday.  It's a fairly small restaurant with a mixture of booths and half-booths.  Quite a tight space.  There was dosa brought to the table, to be eaten with sambar.  It was good!  There was Vada, Chicken 65 (appy), Mutton Biryani, and different curries like Chicken Curry, Mutton Curry, Egg Curry, and the I kept the best for last...Crab Curry!  My faves were the Mutton Biryani and the Crab Curry.  The Mutton Biryani was moist and a nice hit of spice.  Really tasty!  I had it with the raita which I found on the bar.  The crab curry was so delicious!  The sauce makes the crab curry.  Get your hands dirty and try the crab curry!  For $13.99 per person for the lunch on weekend, a good price to go away with a full tummy!    When we have a crab fix, we now know where to go!"}
