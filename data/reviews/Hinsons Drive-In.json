{"text":"Hinsons is the kind of place where you can become a regular and chat with other folks from the neighborhood about your family or whatever else you want to talk about. The food isn't fancy but it is very good and the price is fair. I've been to a few burger places that charge nearly twice as much and I doubt the meat is nearly as fresh.   It's not fancy but the service there has always been outstanding. I've been going there for a few years now whenever I meet a friend for lunch on that side of town. In fact, it's probably about time for us to schedule another time to meet up there and enjoy a burger and fries."}
{"text":"My group had just finished a round of golf and needed some beers and burgers but didn't want to go to a chain....we found this place on Yelp, great place, great food!  As the song that was playing on the jukebox \"I love this bar\" - Toby Keith  We'll be back again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I have only eaten there a few times so far, but every time I try new things and they are always great. The burgers are handmade to order, they put jalapenos on your burgers/sandwiches if you so desire, and the turkey sandwich is so so so good! The fire burger is just phenomenal and the veggies and breads are fresh as can be.  Couple excellent food with cheerful service and a local-yokel vibe, pool table, jukebox with variety(!) and tall boys of pbr and you have found a gem! Great spot, cant wait to return."}
{"text":"I have passed this place for many years and never gone in. I tried it today for the first time. I am glad I did. The hot dogs were delicious! I will be back for sure! The burgers looked excellent too!"}
{"text":"Best burger in Charlotte. Love the down home atmosphere and the fried okra. Bands perform most weekend nights and there's no cover charge."}
{"text":"A friend of mine turned me on to this place several years ago and I aint stopped going yet!! Best burgers, best hotdogs,best bbq, best fries best everything!!!! Cold beer, dos equis!! Phil Hinson is a good friend to me and my family, and we think the world of him and his family!! Phil and Leslie are the two chefs behind the bar and they always go above and beyond. We recently moved to atlanta and miss them alot.Wish Phil would open a Hinsons in atlanta so we could enjoy our hangout place here. Alas atlanta couldnt handle the truth!! Whenever we come back home this is the first place we go! Great prices, great food,great friends!! What else could you ask for. MIss all our friends but we'll see you soon!!!!    HEY, EVERYONE GET OFF THE COMPUTER AND GET DOWN TO HINSONS!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I recently have moved to Charlotte and i'm always looking for a new hole in the wall/dive/greasy spoon restaurant. I've drove by this place prolly 20 times and always wondered about it so i decided to check out the reviews and found were very good so i took the wife tonight and we order Turkey Burger with bacon {wife} she really liked it and very juicy and lots of flavor. I was debating on the Fire Burger and the pulled pork sandwich. I ordered the Fire Burger {double} medium rare and was cooked to perfection and one of the better greasy spoon burgers i've had in a long time. I like that all the burgers are not frozen and fresh made to order. We also had the tater tots, Onion rings and Corn nuggets. Wife said the tater tots were good and i loved the onion rings. The corn nuggets were decent. The regulars were pretty friendly and the owner manning the grills was also very friendly. We were delighted to find this gem. I see this being a regular place to have lunch. Looking forward to coming back next week.  Pulled pork sandwich look out!!!    Lance   PS. To get into this place is a bit confusing just ask my wife, But you drive down about 2 blocks past hinson's and turn right before the shell gas station. If you are at the shell station you have gone to far. Also once you take the right you go down prolly 200 feet and take immediate right and go down what you would call a frontage road i guess and park out back. Don't let the outside fool ya it's worth the stop. We ordered 2 sandwiches and 3 apps and order was right at $20 pretty tough to beat that."}
{"text":"Took awhile for the food but it was very good. Service was great. We'll be going back."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! We recently held my birthday party there. We love their burgers, onion rings and reasonable prices. The owner and regulars are friendly, even to us out-of-towners.  On some nights they have live music or karaoke.  If you like really vintage bars with good food, then you'll love Hinson's. If you prefer a trendy pick up scene, then maybe not."}
{"text":"I have driven by Hinson's numerous times, it has a fluorescent hot dog in the window and it's beside a cement building strip club that just reads: TOPLESS. Always catches my eye. I remember reading about Hinson's in last year's burger bracket. This week was the day I tried it!  The chili and slaw is made in house, he had a bbq sandwich special the day, I was with one of my friends so we ordered a bbq sandwich, hot dog and a hamburger, I wanted to try EVERYTHING!!!  I ordered a jalapeno burger, he put pickled jalapenos on the grill before he placed them on the burger!  I watched him make all the food, he makes every sandwich with care.  The hot dog won my vote, it was piping hot and I asked him to cook it well done, it was perfect.  My French fry barometer registered a sexy whistle because I thought I was at the strip club.  The French fries were so hot, you had to let them cool, even dipping them in ketchup didn't work.. hot, hot, hot!  Phil, the only employee who was there told me they have karaoke on the first Friday of every month, dare I say?????  Let's go? On the list for off the beaten path, authentic, unique to Charlotte lunch stop.."}
{"text":"The place is a perfect dump. Great little joint off the cluster f*** known as Independence. It's a time capsule that serves cold beer, burgers, dogs, etc.. Fast, friendly service, good digs, and did I mention cold beer! Stay gold."}
{"text":"Great food and fun folks without paying a premium for the building. Hot dogs and sausage dogs are the bomb. BBQ and turkey sandwich are great too. A big shout out to Maggie May."}
{"text":"Not sure why some folks go to a 1950 type cafe and then bitch about it looking like a 1950 cafe. Yes it does need a paint job and it is not all shinny stainless steel. But if you want to see what a burger joint looked like in 1950 this is the place to go. Hinsons' burgers are much better than those from the '50s and the waitress and short order cook are very attentive to your needs. When three regulars came in the back door (as a newbie I seemed to be the only one whom entered via the front door) the waitress had a cold beer on the table before they even sat down. Now that is service '50s style. Give it a try if you are curious about honest food at an honest price."}
{"text":"Amazing burger!! It's a little hole in the wall but don't let it fool you the food that came out of the kitchen was fantastic. You can tell they change their fryers. Very homely and they have live bands on Friday nights. Great place to have a beer!"}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed in my fellow Yelpers. This place is a dive bar and certainly no place to get food. This place is basically a rundown shack that is pretty scary to walk into. But I was already running late and had no time to find another place to stop. And since all of you have given it four stars I figured I should give it a try.   There's only one employee to run the bar and the grill and to take money. Hygiene here is nonexistent even though it got a 94% health rating according to the sign.  I placed my order for a few hamburgers and a few hotdogs. I noticed some very worrisome food safety behavior. She reached into the cooler for the hotdogs and put them on the grill and then she reached into a plastic bag for buns without washing her hands. She later cut the hotdogs on the grill in half and put down the knife. Later I saw her cut mushrooms with the same knife without washing or cleaning anything. The raw hamburger meat is sitting out at this tiny work station next to the buns and her cooked food wrapping area. The hamburger meat was in a metal pan and it was sitting on the counter at room temperature.    At one point she took drinks to some bar patrons and took someone's money and went back to the grill and touched the food without washing her hands. I asked for a side of chips and she told me to go to the other side of the bar to pick them out. However all the chips on display were two weeks expired. As I walked out of the bar, I saw a box of frozen turkey patties laying open on one of the customer tables. I have no idea why they were thawing food in the dining area.  We each ate a hotdog and a hamburger and I have to say they were pretty tasty. However, by the next day our stomachs were feeling pretty horrible. I cannot say that it is directly related to this experience but I would caution everyone to be careful if they decide to try this place."}
{"text":"Definitely not going to come here for the decor. The burger and fries would have had more flavor had they been seasoned. Sure there is salt on the counter, but any cook knows you have to season as you cook. Doing it at the end isn't effective. I could see sanitation being an issue, with their setup, but this is true to an extent at every restaurant."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place after living nearby for several years. It's small inside but the service from Phil was great and the people inside were all very friendly. The food was good - exactly what you would expect a small  restaurant/bar to have - burgers, hotdogs, etc  I really liked the way he prepared the hotdog cutting it down the middle. I hear they will put pimento cheese on a hotdog so that's what I'll try next time."}
{"text":"What a great little DIVE bar.  Yes, this is a hole in the wall, if you want new and pretty, this is not the place for you.  This is a beat up 60 year old small local place.   Basic menu of burgers dogs and a couple other sandwich options.  Owner is the grill master, and you can get anything you want just the way you want it prepared.  Burger are fresh ground beef and hand formed to order.  Tots and fries are always super hot and crispy.  Beer is cold and everyone is friendly and on a first name basis with most of the others there.  If you want some fancy chain stay in Ballantyne, leave the dives to us locals...  :-)"}
{"text":"They are doing construction in front of it so you have to navigate back around behind it. Yelp says they are open until 11 pm.  We got there at 9pm and they were closed.   Shares the same parking lot as a topless bar.  Don't know about the food.  Didn't get to try it"}
{"text":"The place is extremely good. People that work there are super friendly and their burgers and dogs are delicious. Would recommend eating there to any one."}
{"text":"The best turkey sandwich ever my girlfriend says, and a great hot dog and burger also. Doesnt look all that inviting but warm inside. The locals that hang at the bar are very friendly and we actually moved to the bar and hung out after we ate. Burgers are fresh not frozen and grills the dogs. Turkey was deep fried and the sandwich was good!!"}
{"text":"Great food, just out of the way.  Yes its run down, but this IS what a local dive joint should be.  The hospitality was awsome!"}
{"text":"I was just here yesterday.  It's still the same awesome food but now they have removed the road from Independence that was by the gas station.  So now you have to drive over the river and through the woods to get there.  I think this is real crappy of the government that continues to make it difficult to frequent this establishment.  Phil and the gang are awesome as is the food.  I hope this place makes it another 40 years!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have nothing against a good dive. In fact, a good dive on its own may get an extra star just because it's not a fast casual restaurant. Place it next to a topless joint and that alone may be enough to put it in the running for five stars.  In this case, however, maybe not so much.  First, finding your way into Hinson's isn't easy. It's not difficult, but it's not as simple as it could be. Then, as with the infamous Asian Corner Mall, you may need to check your alignment afterwards.  Second, the hours are not exactly regular, and the signage doesn't help. Typically you see a building with lit neon and you think \"open\". Not always the case here. They are supposedly open at 11am most days (they are not open Monday). At least one day, however, we came by and they weren't open when they \"should have been\". No explanation - just no one there. It wasn't even the typical July 4 week that some small companies take off. Just nobody around.  If you do happen to get by when they are there, the inside isn't much to look at (there is an inside, in comparison to say Brooks). Staff is friendly, if not overly welcoming. Food is decent, but not exceptional.  Now what makes them a \"drive in\"? Nothing, really. Apparently they used to be a drive-in (think South 21 on Independence near Uptown), but since Independence/Highway 74 grew, they don't do that these days. Frankly, this cinder block building doesn't look much like it could have ever supported a drive-in. But that's neither here nor there, just a tidbit of information I found interesting."}
{"text":"Chilli dog & fries were good. They have been in business 60 years! DECOR IS 1950's old school. Or just plain old. And their are no plates. Food comes wrapped in paper. Cinder block building. Beside a strip joint."}
{"text":"Can't say enough,  old hidden gem.    Been here since 1954.  Old fashion burgers fries.  Hot dogs.  Cooked right in front of by the owner  food is always perfect,  and hot.   I always greeted by my name and thanked for my service."}
{"text":"A little hard to get to now with construction but worth the effort. Nothing fancy, good burgers with no frills."}
{"text":"Hinson's Drive-In is another entry on the Observer's \"Burger Bracket\" so I decided to give it a try.  It's in Matthews right of 485.  It's pretty easy to find, but you have to be paying attention.  You actually have to go past it and take a gravel access road back to it.  It's more of a dive bar & grill than a drive in.  It's small with a bar, about 6 or so booths and pool table & some video games.  The regulars gave me a once over, but the proprietor was friendly and the service was great.  They make their burgers from fresh hamburger.  Sit at the bar and you can watch yours being made.  I opted for a cheeseburger all the way with chili.  All the way includes cole slaw, onion, mustard, and probably some other things which I'm forgetting.  The burger was juicy and tasty.  The fries are frozen, but they were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside which is exactly how I like them.  My burger, large fries, and two beers came to $13, you can't beat that.  Great service, good food, give Hinson's a try."}
{"text":"Don't let the location and outside fool ya, the Best hamburgers and hotdogs I've ever had.  Homemade barbecue too!"}
{"text":"Just tried this placed based on the great reviews. It's a little difficult to get to since there's no access from Independence. Turn right on the street right after it, then take another quick right. I had a Hinson's Burger (ketchup, mustard, slaw, and onions) with cheese and a Hot Dog all the way. I was floored! Both things were great! I was expecting them to put a premade patty on the grill. To my surprise, the ground beef was pressed into a patty right in front of me after I ordered. The burger was flavorful and juicy. The but was placed on the grill as well, which is always a bonus. The hot dog was also out of this world! It was split in half and grilled right next to the burger. It was also delicious. There was a nice crispness from the char from the grill. I didn't get any sides, but there were plenty to choose from. Everything is affordable. Will definitely go out of my way to go here again!"}
