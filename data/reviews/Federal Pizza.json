{"text":"For the price and the taste of the pizza I will make the drive whenever I possibly can. There is a lot of good Pizza in Arizona and this is definitely one of my top choices. Taste isn't the most unique, but it's always hot, consistent, and cost effective."}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch their half a pizza and salad is an amazing deal, pair that with a $5 pitcher of beer and you have an amazing lunch for less than $20 with tip. Happy Hour is great here and the staff is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Mushrooms on the pizza was so burned.  It turned off my appetite. I mentioned to the waitress and all she said was \" oh, really? \" not even a sorry. That pizza ruined my last meal of vacation in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've been here once and thought it was alright. I only had the pizza and thought it was delicious - it was the crust that made it super yummy as well as their wine coolers, but there was nothing fabulous that would have me coming back all the time. So when I went again, I knew I was in store for yummy pizza but not sure what else.   I, and a friend, went back on a busy night. There were people waiting, even outside on a cold rainy night. While we waited, we managed to find a place at the bar and grabbed a beer. The wait didn't seem long and we were seated at a booth. The service was awesome, which was expected since last time was awesome, regardless of knowing one of the bartenders who took care of my friend and I.   Anyways, we started off our meal with their BOH soup. From my experience, in general, BOH soup is always yummy and worth trying! And their soup was worth trying, although I wish their soup of the night had been a bit spicier, it was good. My friend also had moved on from the beer to the hibiscus wine cooler and it was super yummy. I do need to order that next time.   After the soup, we were going to get two pizzas but decided to try an app and a pizza. Experience from last time told me that two pizzas would not be even close to being finished. The app we went for was the Meatball Trio. I wanted to try it for the polenta, the meatballs we're just bonus. I really liked it! The crunch from the polenta with soft yummy meatballs and their marinara sauce was awesome. And the pizza we had - the Manifesto - was just as awesome! I'm not normally a fan of goat cheese or fennel, but on the pizza, it was delish.   And when we thought we had had enough, we decided on dessert. We got a cobbler. Now I'm not a fan of cobblers or fruit pies, but their cobbler was something I ate up. The crust and fruit filling was awesome and was served hot so eating it with ice cream was a must. I just wish there was another scoop of ice cream since the one scoop melted into the dessert lol.   I will make sure to keep coming back and easy my way through their menu :p"}
{"text":"Ordered a few pizzas and sides to go. Got the pizza and it was missing the arugula and balsamic reduction. Had to drive all the way back. I was really hungry so I was pissed, but when I got back someone came out and told me that they deleted my credit card payment and refunded the money. I didn't even ask them to.. I think that's how a good business is supposed to be run. Well done federal pizza, well done."}
{"text":"Incredible service from the hostess to the kitchen. Only downfall is they are really busy all the time. Good for them, not the greatest when you are starving. Of course I guess that would be my own fault.  We went there with some friends to check it out.  We ended up ordering a butload of food to split.  Here goes:  There was a chef's special bruschetta - can't remember what's on it but it was REALLY good!  Big Artichoke:  This is not something I would order as my hubby wouldn't normally eat this and I would end up eating the whole thing.  However, this time he tried it and loved it!  It was large and had quite a bit of \"meat\" on it.  Patty Jane:  Perfect to split between the four of us.  Specifically because of all the other food we ordered.  The pears were poached perfectly and the dressing complimented the salad very well.  Manifesto Pizza:  My hubby and I ordered this, without the fennel as we are not fans.  It's Schreiner's sausage.  How can you go wrong!  Casanova Pizza:  Our friends ordered this one.  As I said earlier, we all shared everything.  This is not a pizza I would have EVER ordered.  Holy crap was it good!!!  (we ordered no dates as we are not fans)  The ricotta and pecorino cheeses melted in my mouth.  Yummmmmm!!!  Lamb Bolognese:  I said I was hungry.... My hubby actually ordered this because he said he wasn't in the mood for pizza (he was wrong, ate both).  It was a little rich for me, but lamb can be rich after a while.  The sauce was amazing.  For the record, we did have quite a bit of left-overs taken home.  We all enjoyed the dinner very much and will be back.  By the way, if you can, ask for Jill.  She is an amazing server!  Just the best!"}
{"text":"Just finished lunch here.  After a half hour wait for salad and pizza our bartender/server comped the meal.  Food was delicious and service spot on.  Highly recommended the ricotta and prosciutto-yum yum.  If only the kitchen was quicker there would be no complaints."}
{"text":"I really love the pizza here. The crust is good all by itself, and not burned like to many other oven pizza places. The toppings show some creativity, and are quite tasty. The staff is excellent, always attentive"}
{"text":"I'm consistently grateful to have a selection of the Upwards family of restaurants within walking distance to my house.  We call on Federal Pizza frequently if we don't feel like driving more than a few minutes for a good pizza night.  As expected, the vibe and service are top notch.  While Cibo and The Parlor still top my pizza list, I truly have no bad things to say of Federal's menu.  Get the roasted veggie board for a healthy appetizer like you've never tried before.  If the weather plays nice, grab a table on the patio and a few of their homemade wine coolers to share (but be careful, some can be way too sweet).  Take a walk down toward Practical Art to burn off that pizza crust after dinner!"}
{"text":"I had a really great experience at Federal's! I turned on my \"adventurous mode\" when I came here and ordered the pizza with dates in them. I was surprised of how much I liked it! The  pizza was baked well with the crust being thin, but not too thin to the point of being overly crispy. The service was great, overall.   I would probably come back again just to get that date pizza!"}
{"text":"Ahhhhhhh how refreshing it was to have good service, good food in a clean upscale restaurant. This was my first visit to Federal Pizza. The smiley host sat us on the patio at my request and we were promptly greeted with water and out menus.  The waiter was friendly, he told us about the special  gave us a few minutes to look the extensive not- the- run- of- the -mill menu over .... then took our order.  I ordered the Brussels sprout Pizza and TLC salad. They offer a 1/2 a pizza and 1/2 salad for lunch for $9.95. My guest ordered Big star pizza and Federal Chop.  The food came out quickly served on pizza trays, it was kinda unusual but it definitely worked. My salad was out of this world. Seriously the best salad I've ever had. I love fresh slivered fennel and it was just the right amount. My crazy Brussel sprout pizza was delish! So yummy. I can't wait to go back  again and again so I can conquer everything on this menu! Oh and my guest enjoyed her meal too, she always does, she visits Federal a few times a month, easy for her she lives in the area, I live in Scottsdale. It's worth the trip. Next time....The Manifesto pizza, Wedge Salad and I've gotta try the Mister Mister for an appetizer! Whooo Hooooo finally something good, obviously I've got to get out of scottsdale more!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious!! And we had the best service we have ever had. AJ the manager was above and beyond the best restaurant manager I have ever met! She was amazing and so was all our service, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went there at 7pm on a Friday night.  They told us 30/45 minutes and it took over 75 minutes. They were super sorry and comped the salads but I think you can do better with your estimate.  When we did eat the food was delicious...the pizza was very flavorful.  The only strange flavor was the caesar salad tasted like it was made with kale!  Not a bad thing just a bit shocking when you order a caesar.  I would go back but not on a weekend unless I had a lot to talk about while I waited!"}
{"text":"First time here today. Nice people, good service, excellent pizza and salad.  Also a cool interior and design.  Thumbs up."}
{"text":"I love sitting outdoors on their patio during nice weather. The staff are friendly and efficient.... constantly monitoring for empty water glasses and empty plates to take away. The waiters use a \"team effort\" approach, everyone watches and helps every table, there is no specific server for each area. Pizza and salads use quality ingredients, always taste fresh. The Brussels sprout pizza is my favorite. Try the lunch/salad combo for around $12; it's the perfect amount for lunch."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom! So good and it makes me not want to leave any for later. My favorite is the brussel sprout pizza. I was really impressed that it has a drive thru and you can even buy beer to take home. Awesome! I am still not sure how their service works because it's always a different face coming to my table during the dinner, whereas, usually you keep the same waitress all night. I wasn't really sure if that was standard or if my waitress gave up on our table. Either way, it's for sure delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"How I didn't know about this place two miles down the road is beyond me.  Went tonight with a large group and was taken aback by this gem!    I had the spaghetti and meatballs.  Portion was huge and took slightly less than half home.  Got to try all three desserts - I'm not a pudding fan so I won't comment on that particular one.  The doughnuts were HOT and soft inside like a pretzel.  Cobbler is normally not a fave of mine, but I could tell the berries were fresh.  Pleasantly surprised.   Heard rave reviews at the table about the lasagna, but portion size was a little skimpy.  Also heard on past visits by others at the table that the pizza is phenomenal.  Will try next time!  This brings me to my last point: service here was excellent.  Genuinely friendly and overall great job.  Only reason I don't five star it is they never brought my side salad.  (Also no bread.  Pasta and no bread?)  Forgot to check the bill.  Hopefully it was left off.    Make your way to this place if you've never been!  Great ambiance and a relaxed crowd with a little wait for a table by dinner time."}
{"text":"oh you hipster SHEEP. federal pizza on central is owned by the same people at Churn and Wwwwwindsor (say it with a British accent). all 3 places: a 10 for decor and uniforms - a 5 for ACTUAL FOOD.  federal pizza is super duper hip with half of the servers who give a damn and are attentive if a bit removed...and the other half straight up negligent, like they went to the Luxe Coffee/Parlor Pizza School of Customer Disservice.  pizza = just OK. too much bread/Ring O Crust KILLS the small sauce/cheese portions. toppings just ok; a little undercooked.  sides/salads decent enough.  there are TOO many pizza options in phx to be a regular here. bianco is flawed but still better. shoot, OREGANO'S has better pizza than fed.  i dunno. we had a pleasant night out. a good time. atmosphere was nice and the music was at the right level and a good playlist. but the prices here are high, which is cool BBBUUUTTT if pay muchas moneys for foods, i want GREAT service and GREAT food. this is not, sadly, fed pizza. maybe they call it Federal because the experience is similar to filing your taxes with the IRS: a bit tedious and boring, and kinda frustrating."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try this place for a while and today I had my chance. They didn't disappoint. Pizza was awesome! Flavorful, good crust, and and the the house salad was a perfect compliment. Good service and ambience and it was a lovely work lunch."}
{"text":"I just left a Federal Pizza and had a great experience.  The pizza was delicious and our waiter was perfect.  The problem is I had 3/4 of my pizza left and had it boxed for leftovers.  My friend did the same.  Unfortunately we left, forgetting our boxes.  As we were walking back to our cars I realized our mistake and quickly called to see if we could come back and get them.  I was notified they were already thrown away.  Then the sadness came!!!  I was really looking forward to having the pizza for lunch tomorrow and really upset I just paid $14 for 3 pieces of pizza.  I realize it was our mistake but I'm writing this to make the suggestion that if people inadvertently leave their boxed leftovers behind please keep them for at least 15 minutes before tossing them!!!  Thanks.  Still sad."}
{"text":"Overall, very mediocre, a work in progress.  Food was good to great, service was HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!   Yes, they are new, yes, they were trying, but still failed.  Our waiter was snarky from the get go and then we could see he was frenzied busy! We ordered first courses and then pizza and I ordered a beer.  Our first courses showed up and still no beer?  He failed to establish eye contact from afar with any in our group of six and finally, one of us waved him down to ask about my beer.  He seemed unmoved, walked over and \"rang\" it in, plopped it rather loudly in front of me, never apologizing or saying a word.  Wow.  We waited at least 20 minutes for our pizza (after our first course was taken away!) while tables around us that were seated much later than we were received their pizzas in a very timely fashion.  We complained and were never apologized to, we just received endless excuses that rang very hollow.  It appeared, to one of my very astute guests, who was watching our waiter like a hawk, that our waiter had simply forgotten to \"ring\" in our order.  No problem, we all concurred, but he never fessed up and apologized!  We kept getting bs excuses from what appeared to be two managers or?? One was female, the other male.  Both were pleasant but did not seem prepared to choose the proper words or handle the problem.  The young female especially made ridiculous excuses and failed to understand what we were experiencing.  She was sincere and so was the male manager, I will give them that.  Ultimately, they did \"good\" by comping our appetizers, and our initially snarky waiter became rather pleasant and sincere.    I have been in the restaurant business for 30 years, in the \"front\" of the house as we call it, and I was shocked overall at how they dropped the ball over and over, though most of it was simple stuff.  I will conclude my review with simple suggestions that the staff at Federal clearly missed.  Drinks should always come before food. When a plate or silver is cleared, another set must be replaced for the main course. My water glass should not sit empty, especially when management and other staff could/should be backing up the very bust waiter. If you forget to bring something ordered, apologize and bring it!   A good server will realize that food is taking too long or something is amiss and will intervene BEFORE a guest complains!  Simple damage control!  Once a guest complains, it has turned into a can of worms.  This is what happened here.    I would go here again, but I don't expect their clearly \"amateur\" level of service to evolve for awhile, so, maybe you should wait to savor their amazing pizzas!"}
{"text":"Pizza: 5 stars Service: 1 star  We arrived on a Sunday night and were told that there would be a 10-15 minute wait.  The hostess recommended we get a drink at the bar and that they would let us know when our table was ready.  We both got a beer and after some time had passed, an appetizer as well.  After completely finishing our beers and appetizers, we checked on our table because there were several open tables in the dining area.  We were told we were up next, so we continued to wait an additional ten minutes at the bar.  Finally, the bartender (who was great) decided to seat us at one of the open tables because no one else was.  The hostess came and apologized and offered us a couple drinks on the house, which was appreciated.  Our waiter came and took our order, but we didn't see him again until he brought the check.  No one asked how our food was.  The food, however, was great.  I had wanted to try this place for a while because I had heard good things.  We tried the Manifesto and the Casanova pizzas, I would recommend them both."}
{"text":"I need to stop going to trendy places with good Yelp reviews.  Nice folks working in a slick space, but my pizza was undercooked (a wet mess in the center) and the meatballs on it were of the mealy, not-quite-savory-enough variety. I know they're meatballs, but that doesn't mean they should mush!  Good crust around the edges, though, so maybe others would be better."}
{"text":"As a real foodie, of partial Italian descent, and multi-generational NY'r, eating Italian, and especially pizza away from Metro NY is always a risky affair!   While visiting friends here, they recommended this place and I was blown away by it. The crust was amazing, and flavors, with fresh ingredients, were superb! Everything we had was excellent, not lacking anything.  And now on to the staff - this ladies and men were very focused on their tables, delivery of the food, and work as a true team. They hustle continually, and it was a thing of beauty to watch while eating.  Don't miss this place, they get it!"}
{"text":"If you like loud music so you have to yell at the person sitting next to you, you'll love this place. I don't understand why these places have to play this loud obnoxious music, especially if your trying to converse with someone. Food OK, but we will not return because of the loud music, ridiculous."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. The tomatoes on the margarita were delicious! We also really liked the salad dressing on the salad we ordered. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza crust- light and chewy.  I do not think you can go wrong with any of the pizzas.  Some favorites: Casanova, manifesto, margherita.  Also, the meatball trio appetizer with crispy polenta is a must have.  Tasty meatballs combined with some crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside polenta.  Prices are decent.  The wine coolers are interesting though, at $8, are a bit overpriced.  Cute mini booths seating inside and a decent outdoor seating area.  I am a fan of Upward Projects and they have not disappointed me yet."}
{"text":"So excited this is open!   The pizza is delicious, and the wine coolers are refreshing and fun!   The space is gorgeous. I look forward to many date nights at Federal Pizza!   Way to go Upward!"}
{"text":"The crust on this pizza is beyond words. You simply have to go and eat some to understand how good it really is. The setting is another Demarco signature location that makes you feel at home and comfortable. Plenty of beer and wine choices to make everyone happy. Good for a business meeting, casual drink, or bring the family."}
{"text":"Appetizer was really good(Mister Mister).  Pizza was good.  The beer selection was OK.  The waitress was just OK.  I wanted to complete an art project so I had called in ahead of time with a special request and was told I could be accomodated.  After trying to order, I found out they did not have all of the necessary items(I needed 1\" pepperoni and green peppers - they only had large pepperoni and red and yellow peppers).  A chef came out and advised that he would do a special order if I emailed the details.  I never heard back from the email.  Pretty disappointing as I was excited to complete my art project.  Overall it was good though.  I don't know if I will go back, I wish the chef would have replied even if he couldn't help.  - update I came back for another visit October 2015.  This time the pizza was not good at all.  Service was not good or bad.  The menu was changed also.  Don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Amanda from federal pizza was able to work with us and help set our reservation for our rehearsal dinner. This was such a relief and we are so grateful to her, and federal pizza, for working with us and making sure we were happy customers. I highly recommend Amanda and her team for any events or dinners you'd want to have with federal pizza."}
{"text":"This place is worth it. The valet service is helpful as there is no available parking. We wee on waiting list 20 mins but was able to nab a seat at bar. My friend had the homemade cooler. Delicious ! Small salad was unique and perfect pair to \"at last\" pizza. We split pizza and also ordered the veggie lasagna. Spilt all foods. Perfect order for two. Atmosphere was awesome. And it was my friends birthday so they came out with a candle in their delicious hot donuts with chocolate on the side . Perfect!"}
{"text":"Went here for pizza on Saturday 7/5/14 with a group of nine.  Fast, friendly service, and delicious pizza.  If you go before 5:00 they have $5 pitchers of beer.  Nice!"}
{"text":"We have been waiting for Federal Pizza to open. We tried it today and had the Casanova pizza, the Big Star pizza, and the wedge salad.  It was very good. Our waiter was arrogant and not much help.  We did like Zack and he told us about the restaurant and answered our questions. We will definitely go back but hope some of the wait staff are a little nicer to neighborhood folks."}
{"text":"Federal Pizza serves delicious food in a fun, casual atmosphere. I love there \"drive thru\" that lets you pick up to go orders without leaving your car. Great place!"}
{"text":"Perfect everytime. My favorite pizza in Phoenix. Good variety, great service and I love the atmosphere. Casual and super cool. Tuesday beer deal is sweet. On weekends make a reservation or you WILL wait up to an hour to be seated."}
{"text":"Cool vibe, awesome drink selection (with 5$ mini-pitchers before 5pm!) and top notch pizza. Their sandwiches are great too! Couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST CRUST EVER! And normally I dont even care much for the crust of a pizza!!  I have had pizza in the best places in New York, Phoenix, San Francisco and San Diego- not one of them comes close to Federal Pizza at all. Great ambience and service - Highly recommend ASAP!"}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite dinner spots! The restaurant itself has a cool vibe, but I usually go through the drive thru. The spaghetti is yummy but dessert is definitely the best part: their bombolinis are delicious!"}
{"text":"Lunch special is a good deal. Any salad and half pizza for $9.75. I ended up talking half of the half pizza home for dinner which makes this a good deal.  Went in around 1:15pm and got seated right away. Both salad and pizza quite tasty."}
{"text":"First time to Federal Pizza after being recommended by several friends.  Not impressed by the service.  My mother ordered a salad but asked the kitchen to substitute romain for the mixed greens.  When it arrived, it was mixed greens but the waitress insisted it was romain... She and I have eaten enough salad to know the difference.    Anyway, she sent it back (no apology from the staff) and we received our pizzas.  The pizzas were pretty good.  Nothing out of this world. Then, after we were finished with our meal they brought her salad back with only arugula... :-/ c'mon.    Because my mother is sweet-as-can-be, she just ask that they box it up.   Also, the hipsterness was way over the top."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite restaurants. I go here with my friends and husband all the time. We gave my parents a gift card to Federal for Christmas and we all went out together last night. I was really impressed with last night's service. It was very busy so the wait was about 20 minutes to half an hour. They had a waiter taking drink orders while we waited and even served us and the rest of the people waiting slices of meatball pizza. I think the staff is very attuned to customers and customer service. Awesome!! :) Oh and by the way the food is awesome!!! I like everything I've tried!!"}
{"text":"Run and hide! Bad service! 10-15 minute wait turned into an hour. They saw I had a baby and no remorse."}
{"text":"I went in this week for the first time and I love the decor and overall design of the place. Menu is somewhat limited but it is basically a pizza and beer place. The food was very good. My party shared a couple of apps, two different pizzas, and the spaghetti. No complaints at all and we enjoyed them all. One member of the party did not like his wine cooler but I tried it and found no issue with it. Purely a subjective thing, although he is, by his own admission, a professional drinker.  There were a few service issues with the hostess and the runners but not at all with our server, who was terrific. (I own a restaurant and am extremely sensitive to service.) Our server's name was Lucy and she was very professional and, more than anything, CARED!  She obviously likes her job and her employer and this attitude made for a great bond between host and guest. If you go to FP be sure to request one of her tables.  I should also add that the on-duty manager, whose name I did not get, had the same caring attitude. If FP continues to employee people such as these two it can only succeed."}
{"text":"Came here on Mother's Day with my buddy (figured no Mother's Day crowd). Staff and ambiance was good. The food came out in 15 minuets. I ordered the peperoni and thought is was ok. I'm not a big fan of gourmet pizzas. I don't my pizza made by someone who went to culinary school but rather by some high school kid who's high on herb. Best part of the pizza was the crust as it was crispy. The pie would be soo much better if there were 300% more cheese on it BUT that's probably the Midwest-iner in me coming out."}
{"text":"It's undoubtedly the best pizza place in Phoenix. I hate the pizzas from the pizza chain stores and this place is definitely unique and serves great authentic pizzas , salads and pastas. They have a good selection of beer and wine, especially on mondays and tuesdays they have this deal where $20 can get you one speciality pizza(any kind) and either a bottle of wine or 2 pitchers of beer. Staff was very polite and offered good suggestions."}
{"text":"My wife and I were checking out places to hold our son's wedding rehearsal dinner when we decided to stop in and check out the place. Ok I sat in the car while my wife went in. Federal was on our list but we crossed it off before we drove up from Tucson. My wife came out to the car and she was really impressed with the staff and also Annie the manager. We decided to try the food (Margherita Pizza and Pumpkin Ravioli). Guess where the rehearsal dinner is at? Pizza and ravioli were excellent also the strawberry and rhubarb cooler. The staff stopped by multiple times to see how were doing and if we needed anything. Great place!!!"}
{"text":"I always have a positive experience at Federal Pizza! They have a great lunch special that comes with a personal sized pizza and side salad for about $8. The iced t is great, the bombolini are divine, and you can't go wrong with the \"big star\" pizza! Can't complain about the service either, they're always super nice and attentive!"}
{"text":"A long wait just for a pizza joint is something I usually won't tolerate. This place is consistently good and we sometimes grab a seat at the bar; even if there's a long wait hang in there you won't be disappointed.  Try fried green tomatoes (yes in a pizza place)!"}
{"text":"I'm big on the taste of the pizza sauce. I think that has a big impact on the overall taste. I absolutely love federal pizzas pizza sauce! Great and fast customer service"}
{"text":"Finally made it into this place.  We have tried to go here a handful of times but always bailed at the last minute thinking how many variations of California Pizza Kitchen do we really need in this city?  Wow was I wrong about this one, crazy good food here-the pizza exceeded expectations but what made it was the appetizers.  We had the F&A Veg Board which sounds pretty simple- a vegetable plate for all intents and purposes but it is really a mixture of preparations of a medley of both common and uncommon vegetables that really set the tone for the meal. The only thing that lost the 5th star was the service. We started out getting 2 servers, one getting our drink order with appetizer, and then a second one getting the pizza order which we thought was intentional. The pizza showed up before the appetizer so I'm pretty sure it was unintentional.  After the barrage of service, it kind of trailed off from there.  Regardless of that, the food is going to bring us back...great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice vibe to the place.  I had a brussel sprout pizza which the combination of pancetta, manchego, garlic and lemon was delicious while the crust of the pizza was ok.  However, it was baked to perfection. Next time I will have appetizers and try a wine cooler."}
{"text":"Mind.blown! This place was beyond amazing! Everyone told me how great the food was here, and believe me it was amazing. The crust was perfect on the pizza! We ordered a pepperoni and a margherita pizza and both were so good!! The ice tea was even good! I also have to say the staff here is fun and friendly and it seemed like everyone helped out, we had multiple ppl come to refill our drinks, we were never left empty! And then I mean how could we could go wrong with donuts and chocolate sauce for dessert!!   I can't wait to go here again! We have a lot of GREAT pizza places in Phoenix but this one is my new favorite!!"}
{"text":"The staff was super nice! My friend and I sat at the bar. We shared the TLC salad which was amazing! We shared a pizza recommended by the people sitting next to us. It was like a deluxe pizza and I forgot the nAme....delish!!! The staff made the 4 stars and I would have given 5 bug pizza was a but soggy. But we still loved it and ate it ! No left overs!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you Kyle, and the rest of the crew, for always taking good care of us. The amazing customer service and even more amazing food is what keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"Two words...wine coolers!!  I can't get them out of my head.  The Grapefruit Ginger was my favorite!  Oh, and the food is pretty amazing as well.  We had the Mister Mister appetizer and the At Last pizza and enjoyed both.  Service was friendly and helpful even though they were slammed.  Love the atmosphere as well.  We're looking forward to eating our way thru the entire menu."}
{"text":"Decent pizza but limited menu and service had lots of room for improvement. Prefer Oreganos for food, menu and service."}
{"text":"I am at 3.5 stars on food. 4 stars on service. Met some friends for a 8pm Saturday night dinner. There was a 30 min. wait and it was a little cold outside. The warm service made all the difference when we arrived. Valet was easy, sat out front and were immediately offered drinks under a heater.   Were seated at a quality booth in the back corner. Like most posters say, you do not know who are the servers sometimes, but that is OK. They are nice enough to look you in the eye and ask ya if you need anything. Impressive. John was our server and was one of those servers that are cool cats with a little attitude that chicks eat up. Me, not so much. But the kid did a good job.   Drinks - great beer selection. Mini pitchers are the way to go for sure.   Appetizers - had the Meatball Trio and the Campari Tomatoes. Good stuff!  Pizzas - We split 3. Brussels Sprout - Yeah, that is what I said, There was no left overs. Really good if you like BS. Casanova - Sweet dates with salty prosciutto, makes this a winner! Manifesto - What! yeah it was good. So some reviews say the crust is burnt, but it really reminded me of pizza in Italy. Good pizza.  Dessert - got a free Bombolini. Just was not too sweet and was missing something. It might be homemade, but does not cover that after dinner sweet factor.   Experience -  It is a cool scene, mixed with some 40 somethings and older folks enjoying the large, comfortable space. You get a number of people serving you, which makes for good service. Go with the flow and enjoy."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and great vibes!  If you are looking for specials, get there around 8pm for the $20 deal. Otherwise, full price for everything."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, the employees are so helpful and nice. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"I have never been treated so poorly as a customer in my life. Our drinks were empty the entire meal and when we asked for a to go box the waitress dumped all our pizza crust in the box after I told her not to. She then closed the pizza box and told me I can deal with it and walked away. The management should really talk to the staff about courtesy and appropriate behavior towards customers. I would rather eat pizza out of a trashcan than go back to federal pizza."}
{"text":"We dined the other night and had the most amazing experience. Food to die for and total 5 star service. It felt like we had 4 servers. The cobbler was the best I ever had and I am from the south. So glad it's close to our house. When you go to have conversation and a bite to eat and only end up eating, well that's what I am talking about. Mike and Cathy Tatmon. tatmon@icloud.com"}
{"text":"I know it's a pizza spot and I do love the pizza, but I ordered the meatloaf (Yes, Meatloaf) once and haven't had anything from there since, except the seasonal burrata, and the polenta, and the cobbler... THE EFFING COBBLER! As a southern man, I can attest for this cobbler...flaky crust, warm berry filling, ice cream to boot! Oh yeah, the meatloaf. No frills, filling, but doesn't feel heavy. Comes with a healthy portion of cauliflower, carrots, and little potatoes. It's really is a good dish when your wife lives on pizza and you don't always want pizza."}
{"text":"Ummmm...don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of the Upward Project restaurant concepts (owners of The Windsor and Postinos), but I'm not sure why all the stars on this one....must be the locals who are thrilled to have another establishment they can bike to.  We ordered the Big Star Pizza (Sausage, pepperoni, onion, green pepper,, mushroom,, black and green olives).   The pizza dough/crust was fabulous, in part due to the wood-fire, but also because the master-chef is a genius.   The flavor of the pizza was fabulous, however it was SUPER SUPER LIGHT on the cheese (which is upsetting to a cheese-person).  We also order the spaghetti and meatballs...bleh.  It came out luke warm, although the meatballs had an excellent flavor.  One thing my husband and I were joking about was that we couldn't tell who worked there and who was a customer.  Not only did we have 5 or six different people stopping by our table to serve us, but this establishment definitely services the younger-urban-hipster crowd (not that there is anything wrong with that :) and we didn't know if the person walking toward us was a customer or a server (we got a kick out of that).   And for the record, my husband and I are in our 40s and felt comfortable there, but we were notably (well...part of me hopes not too notably) older.  I thought the servers were friendly, but not especially attentive.  But then, I'm one of those who struggles with finding a hovering server as annoying as a server is never checks on us....I'm like Goldylocks...I want a service that is \"just\" the right amount of attention.  So, in short,  I would certainly go again, but I think I prefer in order: Postinos, The Windsor and Federal Pizza."}
{"text":"This place has great specialty pizzas. It's definitely not the place to go if you just want a basic pepperoni. I've never had a bad dish here.  The only issue I have is the layout of the restaurant. It's a rectangular shape, with an open concept kitchen across from a bar, plus music; it's not a place you're able to have a conversation without yelling."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. First things first, the decor is very nice, it's clearly upscale. The service was outstanding. We could not have asked for better service.  There was a group of 6 of us. Four of us got the chicken panzanella which was OK but the chicken was very dry and the salad was nothing special except it was a healthy salad. The pizza was OK. The person who got the ravioli LOVED IT!  We felt it was very overpriced since the food was, for the most part, only mediocre."}
{"text":"Federal Pizza is such a Central Phoenix gem. From the moment you walk in you are greeted by pleasant. The management must take great care in their staff, as I always see the same friendly faces. I do miss their Blood Orange Salad from their menu. You can't go wrong with their other salads or pizzas."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. The pizza was not bad at all. I ordered the Meatball pizza for takeout. I loved that they had a drive thru service especially for picking up to go orders. Makes it very easy and convenient. Especially when the parking lot and restaurant are both jam packed. The pizza itself had a lot of flavor. I love doughy crusts rather than crispy and it was the perfect amount of doughiness. The meatballs also had a great flavor. I am very picky when it comes to meatballs and you can tell that they are made fresh. I had a hard time choosing between this pizza or the At Last which included a bunch of veggies. So I'll definitely be back to try that one another time."}
{"text":"Love this place, unique pizza and great selection of craft beer, definitely a hard one to beat. I try and make it for happy hour, which is ridiculously awesome, but even if that doesn't happen the ambiance and service always provides for an excellent time. Have not sat on their patio yet, but love the atmosphere of the interior with the exposed kitchen and full length bar. Would recommend to anyone I know!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Quick simple easy and great tasting. Took advantage of their half priced wine with take out."}
{"text":"tried federal pizza for the first time last night.  easy to park and get a table. we were seated as soon as we walked in.  the 3 different people who waited on us were quick to let us order drinks/ refill/ bring out the food, but once we were served our main dish no one came by until it was time for the check.   normally that would have been fine- except the food was sub-par.  ordered the burrata, sea salt olive oil on crostini.  it was okay, but not as great as the waitor made it sound.  we also ordered the \"Big Star\" pizza.  toppings were inconsistent, some slices had sauce and cheese only while others were loaded with all the veggies and toppings.   needless to say the \"take and bake\" pizza i had from costco was better then the food i ate last night.   i wouldn't order either dish again.    the ambiance is nice, good for a date night or a smaller group going out to dinner.  we sat inside at a table closer to the bar, i didn't feel as if i had to yell to hear, but we were a little tight squeezed with the group next to us.     overall, it was not the experience i was hoping for, i could live off postinos, and enjoy windsor. federal pizza won't get a repeat visit from us."}
{"text":"First time in Phoenix and we decided to try this place. So glad we stopped. It was incredible. The service was quick and the customer service was great. The food... oh the food. I had the Veg Board app and 1/2 and 1/2 Big Star and Pineapple Express. Both were fantastic!! Wide selection of beverages! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Federal Pizza Makes a Statement.  Once upon a time, back in the madcap '80s, some people had lots of money to blow on things like cocaine, South African gold krugerrands, and Cabbage Patch Dolls, or deposit their money in Savings & Loan bank-like institutions. Thanks to people like dead, local crook Charles Keating, who built the Phoenician Resort, the scandal of Savings & Loans cost everybody. Lots.  Flash forward: all the S&Ls went belly up. One ghost of the era was the derelict Federal Savings & Loan on the corner of Oregon and Central Avenues. Flash more forwarder: Upward Projects, who owns and operates area juggernaut Postino (whose bruschetta is GREAT, but not the BEST--that award goes to Cibo. End of subject.), the fab Windsor (with an amazing Crab Cake Sandwich) and Churn bought the white elephant. They've also purchased the defunct Aiello's Italian eatery next door. (Poor, old veteran, nearby Dairy Queen, better be afraid. Very afraid.) Economists call this a \"monopoly.\"  Hence, Federal Pizza was born, as a nod to their ancient incarnation. The old S&L was gutted and fashionably remodeled with reclaimed materials, including a ceiling brilliantly utilizing stacks of corrugated cardboard to muffle the \"thumpa-thumpa\" music. The interior is light and airy in the daytime filled with business people and hipsters and intimate in the night, filled with hipsters and glitterati. The booths filling the center give you a spectacular stage for viewing the clientele and the open kitchen. One BIG boon is the charming Tom Risner, who couldn't be a better tuck trader serving investors.  The TLC Salad ($10) is a safe deposit standout with arugula, spring greens, beets, pears, smoked almonds, fennel, Pecorino and is a sparkling choice among the five salads. You can add chicken for $4.  Twelve very different interest drawing pizzas star on the menu. Each imaginatively conceived pie is 12\" crafted by Master Baker (that's \"baker\") MJ Coe, husband of pastry artist Tammie. One features roasted Brussels sprouts,pancetta, Manchego cheese, roasted garlic and lemon zest. A variety of tastes make it a surprise, but if you don't like the cruciferous sprouts, you might stick with the more traditional Pepperoni or Four Kings Cheese Pizza. Most of these brick oven babies run around $13.  Four prime rate sandwiches are available, served on the fantastic house- made bread. However the Porchetta with slow-roasted pork loin, pork belly, arugula, carmelized onion and lemon ($10) was a bad debt: fatty, fatty, fatty!  May love be your next big wave. A side of crispy Polenta Sticks with Romesco Sauce ($4) earned a high appraisal.   The former Drive-Thru is re- purposed for \"take away;\" the fancy new-speak for \"take out.\"  You won't have to dip into your Christmas Club Account to afford Federal Pizza, but you might want to save a few pennies here and there. Your account can add up fast if you're a spendthrift. And you know where that got the Savings & Loan situation."}
{"text":"Went to this new Upward Project restaurant last Friday for date night with my boyfriend.  We had been wanting to try it for awhile, as we both LOVE Postinos, Windsor, and well, pizza!  I had an email from my birthday which gave us a guaranteed reservation and free dessert.  I called in the car on the way there, and they said they would put my name at the top of the list.  When we arrived, they had already put my name in and said they would call when ready.  Well 40 minutes later, my boyfriend went to ask about how much longer, and they had lost my reservation.  We went back to wait, this time only about 5 minutes.  Sadly though, when they came to seat us, we were jammed in at the hot and crowded pizza oven bar.  One of the seats we were given was not even a regular seat with a back, rather a bar stool from the outside.  We quickly said that will not do, and the hostess seated us in a cute, romantic booth by the patio.  Problem solved...thank you Federal Pizza!  Now that all is well, we ordered the brussel sprout side dish and the date, ricotta, arugula, and prosciutto pizza.  The brussel sprouts were a little lemony, but the panchetta made everything better.  The pizza was delicious...I would highly recommend trying it!   The silver lining about this place is they will come take your drink order while you wait for your table, then add it to your tab at the end.  For a trendy place like this, I will happily wait if there is a big glass of Cab in my hand!    Can't wait to go back and experiment with more pizzas!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! The Big Star & Sweet Potato pizza are our favorites. We also love the Federal Chop. And definitely try one of their wine coolers!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you want to eat really good pizza. I literally had to pinch myself after my first bite. If you get the pepperoni pizza you may feel a little spicyness in your mouth but it's nothing a few sips of cold water can't put out."}
{"text":"HOORAY for Federal Pizza, and their awesome wine/beer/pizza drive-thru!  My Hubby and I have been here multiple times, with friends, family and by ourselves -every time we've visited, we've been happy with the service, speed and of course, the  pizza.   Now if you're looking for the best-of-the-best, real Italian, Napoli style pizza - this isn't it. Their pizzas are 'different' - they take your average pizza, and put a fun, different spin on it (ex. Brussel Sprouts with Pancetta and Manchego cheese!). The only thing that I don't absolutely love, it their pizza crust - it just isn't everything I think it could be. It lacks that rustic, toasty, bubbly, crust. But hey, overall, their pizzas are still VERY very yummy. For this, I give them 4 stars.  Appetizers you MUST try: 1) Burrata - Wow is their burrata yummy! It makes my mouth water just thinking about it. They make tthe cheese in-house, so it's super fresh and gooey. They drizzle it with good quality olive oil, sprinkle it with fresh sea salt, and serve it with crispy crostini.  Best Salad: TLC  Pizzas you MUST try: 1) Sweet Potato 2) Casanova 3) Brussel Sprout  4) Big Star  Best Desert : Bombolini!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in all of Phoenix.  We go here about once a week for the great specials on Monday and Tuesday nights. The wood fired- gas assisted ovens cook the Pizza perfection. I have had almost everything on the menu, and everything on the menu I would want to have again. The service is exceptional and I always recommend Federal Pizza to anyone. The beer selection is pretty solid as well, especially now that they are beginning to rotate a few taps."}
{"text":"Wow, five stars... This seems a bit extreme... However, this place was simply terrific!  We were here with 2 other friends, (4 of us) we got 3 dishes and shared them all together... Delicious!  Pizza, sandwiches and pumpkin ravioli...  It was all good!!! The service is outstanding, atmosphere is marvelous... Dining outside is a must...  Especially with our great evening Phoenix weather in late February.... Plus they have several heaters available... Just in case.  Afterwards we went across the street for ice cream at Churns...  (Another must do!). FEDERAL PIZZA is a for sure recommend!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my Wife & daughter last night, and found the wait not too long, for a Friday. The service was excellent, very attentive, and curtious! Now to the food, everything was served fresh & hot, we ordered 3 different pizzas and all were tasty and just great ! After recently moving here from our of state, it's great to find a wonderful place like this ! We will recommend & frequent you also. .."}
{"text":"We had a reservation on a Sunday and they sat us right away which was nice since it was packed. It was open kitchen and we could see the brick oven cooking all the pizzas. I ordered a wine cooler since they are pretty popular as it was very strong and refreshing. We ordered a chop salad to split and it was one of the best chop salads we had! Wish it was larger since our split portion of the meatball was on the smaller side.  Pizza was good. Service could have been way better also."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of dining in-restaurant at Federal Pizza, though the wait on weekends can be a bit intimidating.   Lately, though, we've been treating ourselves to mini pizza parties at work, and Federal Pizza is a great take-out option. They've got a super funky drive-through and will complete the order relatively quickly!   My all-time favs HAVE to be the Brussels Sprouts pizza and the Sweet Potato & Ricotta. So so so good!"}
{"text":"Their veg plate is da bomb, so is their tempera veggies and their side of beets and beet + pear salad. The pizza toppings are amazing, but I'm just really disappointed with their crust, tastes cheap. Other than that I recommend it--try the margarita pizza"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try this place as we love going to Postinos and Joyride, also run by Upward Projects. The beer selection is different, I liked the variety. We all got pizzas, my favorite was the Cassanova. My friend wasn't so adventurous and got the Pepperoni, which I was told was delicious. I am a bread lover, and I thought the dough was perfect! The atmosphere was great and staff was friendly, but service was a tad slow. We were in no hurry so it wasn't that big a deal to us. All in all a great place to add to the rotation, I will be back."}
{"text":"Pizza! I came with coworkers for a midweek dinner and drink. I haven't had anything else, but I definitely recommend their pizza. I had the Casanova and it won me over -- 5 stars over. Our server was very nice to us as well. They featured a pizza and a pitcher for $20 that night, so I had a little more booze than normal for a week night.  It's definitely a good pizza joint."}
{"text":"We love it. Sometimes the wait is longer than we like but everything is yummy. This place has it going on with food and service."}
{"text":"Rarely do you find a spot that everything you eat is great.  Will be going back soon for more...especially the veggie board!"}
{"text":"Serious, the service and food are both by far the best in central phx.  It's really the people that make this place one of our favorites. Kudos to the staff for never making me transfer my bar tab, for letting me enjoy your great happy hour until our fav booth becomes available and just being good peeps. You never let is down!  Ps, you're everything The Yard should be! Xoxo!"}
{"text":"Federal Pizza is my favorite place in Central Phoenix. Every time we go there I feel happy. Great pizza, great service, and my favorite beer, Kellerweis."}
{"text":"Met my 23 year old daughter here for a late lunch a month ago. She ordered the Casanova pizza...OMG...can I just say how delightful it was! So creative and fresh..it was so delicious. The wait staff was very attentive and knowledgeable about their menu very refreshing! Cool place to just meet and hang out...love what's going on in midtown Phoenix. Thanks for a great experience with a great neighborhood feel...will be back with friends."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both enjoy the pizza here, and he likes the sandwiches, too. I am a vegetarian so I stick to the Margherita pizza; there are several tasty appetizers on the menu, as well. The staff are all very accommodating and the atmosphere is upbeat. We've met friends here and had lots of fun and generally make it back once every couple of weeks. I recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"This was highly disappointing. We ordered two pizzas the pepperoni and the Big Star. Both were extremely salty and the crust was soggy. I was really expecting more since we really enjoy the food at both Windsor and Postino's.  If you are looking for good pizza this is not the place. We will stick to Pino's for take out and Cibo or Pizzeria Bianco for date nights. It was also pricier than other great pizza places in town."}
{"text":"Federal pizza had become our favorite pizza place of all time.   The Casanova is a unique and surprising blend of flavors, it tempts us every time! And, with their Monday/Tuesday specials and the super convenient drive-thru...you can't beat it!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, love the ingredients and the waiters are always helpful and fun to chat with."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the valley. Really fair prices. Awesome atmosphere.  Its really a must t see."}
{"text":"Federal Pizza is the best! The food is amazing and the staff is incredible! I was having a really bad day and got a pizza to perk up my day. Not only did they have the eggplant parm pizza (which is my favorite and a rare special) Amanda the manager went up and beyond turning my whole day around! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I liked the look of the place and I was recommended this place by multiple people so I decided to give it a shot. The service was great but the food was just ok but I did not get a pizza. They have $5 wine coolers before 5 and the blueberry hibiscus wine cooler was really good. The only annoying thing was that there were flies that would not leave our table alone. I definitely prefer Joyride over this place."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Awesome service!!!  Brought the co-workers here and they wished I had told them about this place long ago."}
{"text":"Had high hopes.  Maybe it was an off night.  Really was looking forward to trying the brussel sprout pizza but it was average.  Will have to give place another try."}
{"text":"I have only ever ordered the pepperoni pizza here but I love it. I love the ambience of the restaurant;  and the fact that they offer drive thru service is amazing! (Which I have made plenty use of) Great spot in a great location!"}
{"text":"I took my future wife here for a monday night date. They have the large pizza and a bottle of wine for $20.   The pizza was really delicious and fresh. The wine was called truth or consequences it was kinda of tasty. Its a great place to eat and visit."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always great music & ppl. The pizzas are really good. Haven't had anything that was not good. They have great lunch specials too."}
{"text":"Food is good, if you like thin crunchy pizza crust, but service needs lots of work. Too much socializing between servers and patrons. I actually said to our latest server that I was \"Sorry to interrupt her socializing, but could she bring our table another round\" of drinks. She didn't even realize I had cut her off at her knees... I don't recommend this hipster haven...Another server was standing out front of the business when we left, having a helluva argument on her cellphone, complete with f-bombs and loudly stating that \"you're broken, dude! to the broken dude she was arguing with on her cellphone. . Nothing against youth, but this place is truly Hipster hell, not for people in their late forties like me and my dinner companion. Hire servers with maturity."}
{"text":"This place has best pizza in town besides Pizza Bianco. The margarita pizza is so fresh and simple and tasty."}
{"text":"Diverse appetizers with vegan and vegetarian dishes. Very accommodating and adapting to dietary needs.  Waitress friendly and helpful. Fennel could have been cooked a little longer. Music kind of fills in the gaps and is a little loud.  Eclectic range of music. We will be back."}
{"text":"Pizza is great.  $5 pitchers of Green Flash West Coast IPA before 5 pm???   DAYUM!!  that's a screamin deal!"}
{"text":"First visit did not disappoint! Unusual pizza combinations with perfect crust fit for foodies!  The iced tea is awesome and the service was great! The waiter recommended the Casanova pizza and I loved it, but it was a little too unusual for my husband. Brussels sprout appetizer is really good too!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the Phoenix area and was referred to this restaurant. The pizza, and even the house salad, were AMAZING! We sat on the patio and had gray service, wine, and food. I highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza... Great location... Um, um,,,,, awesome drive through... Say whaaa!  Would like to try other things on the menu, so You have my attention....  So far so good,,,, i have faith that you will be good in the long run, but I'll be watching.. Waiting....... ;-P"}
{"text":"Great good, great atmosphere, and great service.    Federal Pizza serves up some delicious pies.    The restaurant is decorated nicely and the lighting is nice and dim.   The servers, hosts, and bartenders have always been kind and welcoming on every occasion.    A great date place; you can have some ice cream at Churn across the street after dinner."}
{"text":"The pizza is always great!  I love the crust and the different options.  They are always accommodating for two adults and a child that can't eat cheese (we usually do a half of mine for the little guy dairy free with just pepperoni).  During the nice weather, it's great to be able to sit outside on the patio and people watch."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The décor is modern and also the food is great. But the service is a five star. The only recommendation is to have more restrooms since the restaurant is so big and I had to wait a long time for it."}
{"text":"I have been to a ton of pizzerias in the past, and several have not been nearly as good as the pizza here at Federal.  Once you enter the restaurant, you automatically can see that it's a modern restaurant that appeals to the hip and chic vibe that many people are attracted to. The workers are friendly and the crowds of people waiting or eating tells you that this place has captured the attention of hundreds. During the daytime, the atmosphere gives off a serene vibe that allows you to relax. At nighttime, the place transforms into a nighttime joint full of a variety of music and a friendly vibe that is carried through the immaculate service of the workers.   The food is, in short, delicious. They have a unique variety of pizzas that are nothing short of yummy. The best part of their pizzas are that they're handmade by the chefs that work vigorously in the back. Although pizza is the food of focus, their salads, pasta, as well as other selections on the menu do not betray the word delicious.   If you are looking for a place to eat lunch during the day or somewhere to chillax during the night, Federal Pizza is your choice!"}
{"text":"We came here after having the worst service at Fez and leaving prematurely. Federal Pizza was awesome. Service was great and my wife and I shared a meatball pizza with ricotta cheese. It was EXCELLENT. Definitely coming back with friends."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza.  Great prices.  Super attentive service, team approach.  Had the Casonova Pizza--Ricotta, arugula, and prosciutto.   Don't pass up dessets and pitchers of good beer.   Definitely coming back.  Zach our waiter was the best by the way."}
{"text":"The pizza here is alright.  My friend and I shared The Answer, which was decent but nothing memorable.  My friend also ordered the Spaghetti & Meatballs which was okay.  The meatballs are just average.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by their wine coolers!  The grapefruit ginger wine cooler was delicious and I like how they make it themselves!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC PIZZA!! I went with a group of five (six of us in total) and we sat on their super cute patio outside in the back of the restaurant. We ordered a Manifesto pizza , and a pepperoni pizza and the waitress was so cute and nice she gave us a free cheese pizza because she liked us! All the pizzas were delicious. Good wine. Good beer. Overall fantastic place. Def going back. Oh ! Did I mention I believe I saw a drive through !!!"}
{"text":"I am clearly in the minority on this one. That said, here goes:  Stopped in on a Tuesday night when we noticed that the line was not out the door. Walked up and was seated immediately. The decor / ambience inside the restaurant is top notch. Very hip, very trendy, but also comfortable.  We ordered drinks. Watermelon Wine Cooler and a Pilsner Urquell. The wine coolers are fantastic. Very original and done very well. Next we moved to appetizers. The F&A Veg Board. Wonderful! A nice nice mix of vegetables paired with romesco sauce.   The pizza came next. We opted for a Gemini and a Meatball. I gotta say, I have had better pizza (Bianco, Cibo, Parlor). The ingredients were good and inventive. However, the crust was just ok. We paired the pizza with crispy polenta sticks. They were a home run. Would definitely get them again.  I would recommend this place of drinks and snacks. If it is pizza you are searching for, there are better options. However, all around, the place is done well and definitely worth a look."}
{"text":"There are an awful lot of artisan pizza restaurants in Phoenix these days.  Federal Pizza joins the fray with Pizzzeria Bianca, LGO, The Parlor, and North Fattoria Italiana.  I gotta say, for me, Federal Pizza simply doesn't stack up to the competition.  I wanted so much to fall in love with this place because it's an Upward Projects restaurant and I love pretty much everything they do.    The design, service, clientele, and environment are everything that I love about all the Upward Projects spots.  There is a really great trendy local feel to this place.  Unfortunately, the food just doesn't match up.  At least the pizza doesn't.  Some of the salads and the pork sandwich are pretty good.  I find the pizza crust itself to be bland and uninspired, although it has good consistency and is always cooked appropriately.  The sauces are completely lacking in flavor.  The toppings seem as though they would create interesting flavor profiles, but ultimately fail on that front as well.  Don't even think about the pepperoni or sausage options--you'll be drowned in grease.    I keep going back for the pitchers of beer, friendly environment, and roasted vegetables."}
{"text":"Tuesday nights are the best here! Great deal on pizza and wine! I've tried almost all pizzas here  and none have been disappointing.  Must try!"}
{"text":"Great side dishes.   Pizza is good. great sevice. Will try make your own pizza next time."}
{"text":"Fantastic neighborhood eatery. Never had a bad experience at Federal- pizzas are best in Phoenix.  Great value and awesome specials; especially their Monday & Tuesday deal after 8pm. People and atmosphere are equally great."}
{"text":"Love this place! The vibe is chill and the staff is great. We ordered the federal chop salad and a pepperoni with arugula pizza. All very good! Sat outside and our server was awesome. Two other diners had small dogs that were cute and well behaved so I'm guessing Federal is pet friendly. I saw that they gave water bowls to the dogs. Will be a go to when in Phoenix for sure!"}
{"text":"We ordered the meatball pizza over the phone and picked it up via drive thru. I expected the person at the door to come out to serve me and take my payment, so I ended up sitting in the car for over 5 mins. I finally ended up getting out of the car to get the food and pay for it. Not great service, but great food"}
{"text":"Actually delicious pizza with delicious ingredients. They have a few gluten free selections. Great seating inside and out, and friendly servers."}
{"text":"Because it's better than municipal pizza. Or school district pizza. No seriously this place is great!! New to Phoenix, I've come here 3 times for dinner. The first time was a weekend and we didn't have a reservation, waited maybe 10 min and we were seated. The other two times I made a reservation. \"A reservation for pizza?!?\" you say?? Yes, it's worth it.   Their menu is creative, with pizza standards like pepperoni and sausage very nicely done with quality meats. Lots of other gourmet toppings available, and their wood fired thin crust is just the right mix of crispy and chewy. Don't miss the Brussels sprouts starter cooked perfectly with pancetta.   Federal Pizza has a pretty good beer selection on tap, a great wine list. The restaurant is clean and it's clear the operator pays attention to details, from the tasteful but not-too-bright lighting to custom-logo bathroom tissue in the restroom, and always prompt and great service from the staff."}
{"text":"New to Arizona and this by far the best pizza I have ever eaten, they are pricey but good."}
{"text":"I love the idea and I understand the whole ambiance. I just want to first off say the service was outstanding and basically the word of mouth based on the place being packed has got around in the Phoenix area on Federal Pizza. I went in with my girlfriend the other night and we split an artichoke, salad and one pizza with two waters for a total of 40 dollars. I gave the valet guy 5 bucks and I tipped the waitress 10. After walking out $55 dollars I can't say it was worth it. Don't get me wrong the food was delicious and I don't really like giving bad reviews but it seems a little out of my price range."}
{"text":"I'd give 5 if they would put some more salt and possibly a pinch of sugar in their crust.  The pizza is great, the lunch special is perfect.  I just personally love the crust on a pizza and this one, although perfect from a consistency standpoint, lacked any sort of flavor what-so-ever. Great pizza - Add Salt!"}
{"text":"What a cute place! First visit last night with a pal, who had not been there either. Great service and engaged staff. However, I am a bit perplexed at the rave reviews for food. From the side menu, we had a little salad and the meatballer (one meat ball.) Both were great--good food quality and a nice way to taste a few items for next time. My disappointment was in the pepperoni pizza. It looked great, but my first thought at the initial bite was \"oh, no, frozen pizza.\" From the reviews I was expecting something on par with the good old days at Pizzeria Bianco or the good new days at Lamp in North Scottsdale. The pizza literally tasted like frozen food. My friend did not comment at all, so I am figuring she didn't want to mention it, since it was my suggestion. I brought a few slices home for my son and asked him his thoughts...his first words were the same as mine! Again, I wish them well--cool place and nice menu, with good variety. Perhaps some of the other pizzas really deliver, but the pepperoni did not!"}
{"text":"Their menu has changed a bit since their opening, but their \"At Last\" pizza with subbed mushrooms instead of corn is the best thing I've ever had. Ever. I've tried their salads, almost every pizza, the burrata and it's all divine."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! The pizza is always amazing as well as the salads! We always love getting the chefs special when we go! YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Yum! We visit Phoenix pretty regularly and usually stop in at the Windsor for a bite. They had a wait and we didn't have a lot of time, and our pooch was with us so we were looking for a patio. The Windsor staff suggested we go across the street to Federal as they also have a patio and are a sister restaurant to Windsor. They called and let Federal know that we were coming and Federal had a table ready for us on the patio immediately and even filled up our pooch's dog  bowl with water for us. Nobody else was on the patio (no misters) but our waiter still came out and checked on us enough, and not too much. We shared a Chicken Caesar Salad and a Margarita Pizza which were both super yummy. I definitely judge a place on their Caesar salads. :)  The vibe inside and out at Federal was relaxing even though they were busy. The restaurant was clean - even the bathrooms - even though they were busy and nobody was rushing us - which I really can't stand to be rushed. We will definitely be returning to Federal sometime. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Our go to place- the appetizers can be a meal on their own the mozzarella cheese it so good as are the Brussel sprouts & seasoned potatoes- the pizza and pasta are excellent and the meatballs are perfect- the chocolate sauce that comes with the little donuts is so good A++"}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday,  was at the end of the lunch hour so we were offered a seat in the sun on the patio, i asked to wait for one in the shade, a majority  of the empty tables were dirty. Our server was very friendly and brought our iced tea, it was passion not plain,  i guess that is all they have, it was good. I got the 1/2 pizza and salad for $10.50- chopped salad and a pizza  with sausage, peppers, mushrooms,  olives, etc. I was asked if I wanted grated parmesan, i said Yes! I got 2 quick grates and she was gone- a little more would be perfect. .. she held the cheese in her bare hand, which I think would be against  health code. The pizza  was good as was the salad except  that there was blue cheese in it! Many people wouldn't  mind, for me, it is a problem,  I  am allergic! ! I had already taken a bite into a chunk and swallowed,  not to spit on my plate or cloth napkin, which is what I should have done because I have been on meds since and I have spent all morning  in bed today! It was NOT supposed to be in the salad, i double checked,  so that is just a sloppy kitchen, where things are carelessly  handled and food made! I told the server, but no response  was forthcoming, most restaurants would have a manager  talk to you. Between  that snd the fact that they are owned by Postino, I will never go back because  I  produce  a charity benefit for homeless  veterans  every year. I went to Posting Arcadia  and asked for a donation for the raffle,  they told me to come back, I did, they said  no. I do all of this on my own time and gas!. So, when other businesses  in the area support the benefit taking place in their neighborhood  to raise money for AZ StandDown /homeless veterans,  like The Vig. Teepee Mexican, Z Greek and more... but places like Postino, Beckett ' s Table and Acacia don't,  I  feel I must support  the places that feel veterans are important  and their customers  being sick from their sloppy and careless handling of the food means something  to them!!!"}
{"text":"I am again amazed at how awesome this place is. A busy Friday night and the hostess gals are cool, calm and collected. I sit outside in the freezing (you know, 50 degrees!) weather for my table, under a nice warmer and they bring me a DRINK! Cool beans!  I am such a weird eater, and make that disclaimer to all our wait staff. So the polenta appetizer and a side of beets for dinner doesn't even make her bat an eye. And both are fantastic. The beets come with pears, romano cheese shavings and pistachios. (There were some greens on top, but I dispensed with them---way too healthy!) The polenta is cooked, sliced into sticks, fried and covered in parmesan (do you feel the \"cheese\" theme?). The grapefruit ginger wine cooler recommended by one of the wait staff was a great compliment to my selections.  Hubby had the \"Big Star\" pizza, a manly and meaty pizza, which he completely devoured. He had a nice small pitcher of beer that fit the bill.  We were too stuffed to even think about dessert, but we'll be back (maybe tomorrow?) to hit that part of the menu.   As stated in countless other reviews, ambiance is great, menu swell and I have to say, after the week I had dealing with snarly vendors, what a nice change of pace in the service department!  Love Churn, Love Windsor and now I officially (YELP) Love Federal Pizza!"}
{"text":"The food at federal is so different and amazing!!! They have great beer specials and very good service. The only draw back is the flies. I love an open atmosphere and enjoying the nice phx weather but if I'm eating inside its because I don't wanna be bothered by the bugs and its been an issue every time I've gone here.  I didn't lower the ranking since it was only 1 fly this time and it didn't land in my food (that I noticed). I thought there was some food \"code\" that said if you leave your doors open then a air curtain is required????  If that's not a thing than it should be!"}
{"text":"I really dig this Upward Projects restaurant the most; probably due to my affinity for tasty beers.  Anyhow, they have great drink selections (besides beer) including wine and house made wine coolers.  Some of the wine cooler flavors I have tried include: grapefruit ginger, raspberry lavender, and blackberry rosemary.  All of which were good, but I liked the blackberry rosemary the best.  I usually order the castlevtrano olives as a little snack and a Great Little Salad.  I have only tried the Brussles Sprout pizza (cause I'm trying not to eat wheat, get off my back!) which comes with manchego cheese, lemon, roasted garlic and pancetta (I got mine without meat). It is perfection! The texture of the crust is perfect, with a nice little crunch around the edge (thanks MJ).  I recently tried the Garganelli pasta dish, which took much difficulty to not wolf it down.  It was so good (even though I think I overdosed on gluten), it came with: broccolini, pine nuts, oven roasted tomatoes, red pepper, pecorino all tossed in a lemon basil pesto.  One word: nomtastic.    The decor is rad and the people serving it up are, too.  If you haven't checked out Federal, get your buns down there ASAP!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Okay, first off let me say that i am going to DREAM about those refeshing wine coolers until I can make it back to Phoenix. Service was great. The music and environment were right up my alley. I had the Burrata and olive oil appetizer and some pizza with dates and augula. Everything was FANTASTIC!   I believe this is by the same restaurant group that provided us with Postino. With that being said, you should already know that you will LOVE this place."}
{"text":"Simply, my favorite pizza in town. Even my kids love their crust. Also has a great vibe with energetic music, making the evening truly a night out!"}
{"text":"Great hip place with super pizza. No hard liquor but great beer and wine selection but also great management!"}
{"text":"pretty dam good pizza totally worth the money not  the best I ever had but top 10 wood fired pizza looks like they have some awesome beer on top coming back with the wife soon"}
{"text":"First yelp review ever for me!  I've been to Federal Pizza several times, and have used their drive-up takeout.  Everyone I have brought here has liked it!  Their buildout is a fantastic repurpose of the bank building.  The service has been consistently great, with drinks always refilled.  It can be a little loud if you're in one of the center booths, but nowhere near as bad as the music blasting at Joyride next door.  I remember it being much quieter on Federal's patio, so that's an option!  I have managed to avoid having to use the valet parking.  Thankfully there is now a parking lot available across the street, and they built a crosswalk.  As for the food, I've tried the pepperoni and meatball pizzas, plus a custom pancetta and egg pizza.  All have been very tasty, though the pepperoni is quite oily and the meatball pizza was a tad bland when I ordered it onion-free.  As others have noted, their distinct crust is thin, pillowy, chewy, and very delicious, even if they bake it a bit longer than I would prefer (I guess they're reacting to undercooked complaints by waiting for the crust to lightly scorch).  The meatball sandwich was also good.  The Oreo dessert (Lil' Triple) actually tastes a lot better and less processed than it sounds, and the bombilini are also great when fresh and warm.  Minus 1 star for somewhat high prices, particularly if you customize your toppings."}
{"text":"It's really good they have a lot of good beer and good wine and the waiter offered us extra chili flakes and Parmesan cheese before we even ordered the pizza was so good and the Brussels sprouts were a real home run and we had to order another one to go when we were done"}
{"text":"Really like the Brussels sprout pizza!  The service is fast and seem like they like their jobs, friendly.  Worth the wait.  Also god selection of craft beer and wine."}
{"text":"Excellent as always! I usually order the casanova pizza lunch special, half pizza half salad and pair it with the woodchuck cider. Top it all off with the bambolinis for dessert and that makes for a wonderful lunch. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been intending to try this place for what seems like FOREVER. I get close to the Windsor & go with my happy usual. However I was out on a Sunday Funday & wanted pizza & headed here. I am going back & trying every pizza on the menu. I loved the Casanova so much I have to. The wedge wasn't the usual iceberg & perfect. Beer cold & service great. Can't wait to go in next Tuesday with my girlfriend for the summer deal which is 2 (small) pitchers & a pizza for $20. What a gem!"}
{"text":"Food is good, beer is great, service is horrible! Twice we have used the drive thru and each ti me it has been a hassle.  The drive thru server has acted like we are a inconvenience!  Forget refilling your growler via drive thru...too much drama. We love this resturants proprietors but have been severly diappointed with Federal!"}
{"text":"The burrata is so good, but how can a huge glob of cheese not be. The pizza is incredible and they never skimp on toppings. Definitely has the hipster vibe. I take a star away for their hit or miss service. It seems like you never have one waiter/waitress at this place (like Joyride and the other Upward Projects places- all good btw) which makes it easy to get forgotten about."}
{"text":"went again. this time with a smaller group of friends. pizza was just as yummy, service just as good if not better. love the people and vibe at this place. And the music isn't bad either :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try Federal Pizza for the first time for a day after Christmas late lunch. And even at 2:30pm, the place was packed. We had to wait briefly for a table, but only about 7 minutes or so. The vibe is hipster, but less so than Windsor. We decided to try the Corn Coins as an appetizer because my husband had heard good things about them, and we weren't disappointed. They basically took a corn on the cob, sliced it into thin coins, and grilled it, then topped with fennel, cheese, and paprika. The corn could have been cooked a little more in my opinion, but it was good. It was similar to the elote at Gallo Blanco, only with less cheese. On to the main course: I got the margherita pizza, and my husband ordered the meatball sub. We were happily enjoying the corn coins when one of the servers came up and said that they were remaking my pizza because the first one grew a large air bubble and it wasn't up to their standards. He was very nice, and we appreciated him taking the time to tell us that. That said, the pizza arrived within 5 minutes, so I never would have noticed anyway if they hadn't said anything. The pizza was amazing--just the right amount of olive oil, cheese browned to perfection, and that CRUST! It was delicious. My husband loved the meatball sub and said the meatballs were spicy. All in all, we were able to take a half of the pizza and a couple remaining corn coins home, and I didn't feel overly stuffed. (Can't say the same for the husband--he ate the entire meatball sub.) Bill came to just under $30 before tip, which was reasonable. We will definitely be back--I'm sure they do a great happy hour."}
{"text":"I've found my Cheers :)  This place is everything you want your local neighborhood pizza joint to be!  Pizza cooked to perfection.  Just crusty, hot, finger-licking, may burn the roof of your mouth, no peppers needed, no ranch needed pizza.    This was out first time trying Federal Pizza and while driving home one night my boyfriend and I were starving and craving pizza, just stopped on by because it was a Wednesday night and a nice crowd outside.    Boy are we glad we stopped!  We started with the Mister Mister appetizer and a pitcher of a seasonal beer!  The Manifesto for dinner!  Total hits!  Seriously, this is by far some of the best pizza I had in Phoenix!  Considering giving it a shot for lunch because it's 12:05 and I have a visual of the bartender/server slowly putting fresh, shredded Parmesan cheese on my pizza before devouring a slice :)"}
{"text":"Pizza was good but nothing special.  Still need to sweeten the sauce, very bland.  The appetizer with the cheeses, bread, olives, and meat were very well and worked well. Very good. The ore triple with marshmallow fluff sooo good, coffee sooo bad."}
{"text":"best pizza - We keep going back for their pizza! We just love it, Its hard to find a pizza so good, and we think we found the place, its truly amazing, We highly recommend that you checking this place out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the big deal.  Beer and wine meme only.  Beer tasted flat and the food was just ok.    Really busy on a Friday, waited over an hour for a table."}
{"text":"I judge a pizza place by their Margarita Pizza. This one had a soggy center with fresh cooked tomatoes. There should be no tomatoes on a Margarita. I'm sure this is why it was soggy. The Brussels sprout appetizer was good, however, a bit under cooked. I appreciate the fact that they were grilled in butter and not fried in some unhealthy oil."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get pizza! Very unique flavors and combos! The entire upward project brand is amazing! The sweet potato and ricotta pizza is my all time favorite and have not found another place that does anything even remotely close! Cannot wait to get back for more!"}
{"text":"Wow. Again, Wow. I had heard about Federal, but kept forgetting to go (there soo many good restaurants in the area). I decided to get some takeout after a hard day at work. We started with an order of the marinated Castelvetrano Olives ($4) that were mind numbing! We also got the house chopped salad that came with prosciutto, cappicola, provolone, peppers onions and a great vinaigrette ($10) and one of the best salads I've ever had! We also got the meatball pizza ($14) that was just amazing. I couldn't believe how perfect the crust was, and this was TAKEOUT! I can only imagine how good it is in house and super fresh. All in all, our bill was a measly $29 and worth EVERY STINKIN CENT!!! I'm super happy to have another great restaurant in the area!"}
{"text":"We've never eaten inside the restaurant, but we have regularly been driving home from work and said to one another \"I could really do pizza tonight\"  30 seconds later he's got his phone out and we're ordering our regular: big star pizza and tlc salad.  That's really all we get and everytime it's amazing.  With the restaurant being an old bank building, I love that they've maintained the drive thru lane and we can just drive up to pay and receive our order.  It's ridiculously convenient.  We've eaten a lot of pizzas in the valley, this is by far our favorite and now we can't eat any others without a) feeling ill or b) comparing it.  Nothing is as good.   Try it, you shouldn't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Place was pack! Had enough beers to chose from. Pizza was good! Brussel sprouts is recommended."}
{"text":"The pizza at Federal is very good. Everything else is so over-priced that we almost never go. We live about a half mile away and have been maybe three times. Last night we decided to try again. The Margherita Pizza was delicious. We also got two Great Little Salads (operative word is little) and Lamb Bolognese. The total takeout bill was $42. The salads are a complete ripoff. They were $5 each and tiny. TINY. The pasta dish was about the size of a salad plate and was $16.  We probably won't go for anything except for the occasional pizza. It's not worth the cost."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  One of the best, in fact.    Customer service was pretty decent... But I think it might be hit or miss, at least as we experienced.  Two of our servers were phenomenal, one was just ok.  It all comes down to customer service, doesn't it.  I would definitely recommend Federal Pizza."}
{"text":"LOVE! Great service, great drinks, great food.   We went in for lunch and got their special that included half salad and a half pizza for $10.50. It was a great way to check out a pizza without committing to a big pizza.   Also! Happy hour until 5, you have to get the Blood Orange wine cooler for $5."}
{"text":"Everything was delightful and delicious.  Casanova pizza, chopped salad...oh my. Uber relaxed and amazingly wonderful.  Megan suggestions for us newbies was a welcomed wonder. We are already planning our next visit."}
{"text":"I really just love this place...for take out.  We've dined in a few times, but the wait is usually very long (duh...because word is out that it is fantastic) so now we take out 90% of the time.  Our favorite collectively, is the Big Star pizza, my husbands favorite is the Pepperoni and mine is the At Last.  The flavor combination on At Last as a meatless pizza (and I'm a meat eater!) is so well thought out.  I feel like I'm a judge sampling a pizza on a cooking show or something.  Seriously.....try it.  And tonight, we got (our first here) dessert, the Lil Triple.  It was really good. The chocolate cream is more like just chocolate pudding.  But it was cute anyway. And the staff who takes and hands off our take out order are just the nicest and most attentive. We had Josh take care of our take out order tonight, and he was great. Just go...it's worth a bit of a wait.  Bring friends, have some drinks at the bar, the beer selection is great too! Brava!"}
{"text":"I will be honest, the first time I came I wasn't that impressed. Impurities in the beer, mediocre pizza ... Everyone has a bad night so I came back for more. This time around we got the pizzas we should have ordered the first time (second guessing screwed us over). I forget the names but one had meatballs and the other had peppers and some spice. VERY good. Pitchers of beer are very reasonable. The homemade wine coolers were especially good (grapefruit ginger).  We'll definitely be back for more. My only disappointment was the lack of use of the TVs. Football was on and the TVs were off. Forcing us to be social?? Bah-humbug."}
{"text":"Good pizza and the place is awesome, there apps are where it's at, pizza was thin crust, tasted good but the fries were bomb!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Great ingredients! Love a good pepperoni pizza with a glass of sauvignon blanc and pino for my love. We go a few times a month! Great service and kiick back atmosphere. Decent enough music too!"}
{"text":"Who has the aux cord because someone has been playing a lot of bloc party, grizzly bear, modest mouse and some other bangerz. Oh yeah the the pizza is bomb AF"}
{"text":"We've been going to Federal since it opened. Love all the salads, the cobbler is great but have the ice cream on the side as it turns to cream immediately due to the cobbler temp. We usually have the 4 Kings pizza- consistently good. Give it a try, you'll like it..."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in the world is.... the Casanova. Always get great service here as well."}
{"text":"We have found our pizza spot.   Love all of the food. The salads and pizzas are great whether you go with a more traditional style or their funkier styles.   Try the sweet potato pizza and add sausage it sounds crazy but tastes like thanksgiving dinner.   They also have a drive through window which makes take out orders very easy."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I live in SD, CA! And the times I have come here I have loved it!!! The food and service are amazing!!! Nicole was our server and she was amazing! If she isn't in management, SHE NEEDS TO BE!!!!"}
{"text":"I have heard about this place for a while and it comes up all the time (on yelp) when I visit my friend in downtown Phoenix.  I have wanted to try this place, but I never wins over all the other places to eat.  Well that changed this time.  My friend wanted to meet for lunch here and I have to say I was impressed, though it has a hipster vibe.    Lets start off by talking about the parking.  It shares a parking lot with Joy Ride Tacos; so if you don't get there early enough, you will be doing the \"complimentary\" valet parking.  But I don't grade on parking, so on to the food...  We ordered two appetizers.  When looking at the menu, we ordered the first one, called the three meatballs and the last one, I dont know that one's name.  The last one is five - six pieces of oven toasted bread and this \"ice cream\" sized scoop of some kind of cheese.  Make sure to use both the mint leaves and the cheese when you eat the bread. That will a huge difference.  Next we got the three meatballs.  The meatballs themselves are not anything special. But it comes with two fried pieces of polenta and toghter.  That becomes a very \"tasty meatball.\"  On to the entrees.  We got two pizzas a sweet potato one and the big star.  The big star was very yummy. It has sausage, green and balck olives, bell peppers. On top of their pizza sauce.  This would have been enough and is was very yummy.  But my friend had to have his sweet potato pizza.  I was pretty concerned with this idea.  But I have an open mind so I tried it.  Best decision today.  It has slices of sweet potato and little bits of cheese (like goat cheese or something). The sweet potato add just enough sweetness and the cheese does not over power the delicious flavors of the pizza dough and sweet potato.  I recommend this pizza, as long as you like sweet potatoes.  Finally dessert. It was my friends birthday so he had a email offering him a free dessert.  We got the \"bubbles;\" which was basically doughnut holes with a chocolate dip.  Again this was also delicious.  The server suggested some kind of Oreo dessart, I'll have to try that next time.   If you don't mind paying a little bit more for pizza, I highly recommend Federal Pizza.  But if you do mind spending a little extra for pizza, I feel sorry for you.  There are so many tasy pizza places that end up on the pricier side."}
{"text":"Awesome place!! The only thing I haven't fallen in love with is the veggie lasagna- thinner slices of eggplant and more cheese would make it perfection. Otherwise, Federal knows what's up. Easy to-go window and delicious pizzas!! Try the meatball and polenta appetizer!!! So gooood."}
{"text":"I recently went here with some friends, and the service was amazing. The staff was fun and hip, and eager to check in on us at every moment ( not in the way that annoys you because it becomes far too redundant ) but merely in a manner that makes you feel like your needs are always met, we went during happy hour, the special is great and the beer and pizza deals are amazing, we will definitely had this place to our go to spots"}
{"text":"This place has good food, but when I got a to go order on new years eve the girl who rang up our bill was rude. She acted like we were bothering her. The guy who welcomed us in and brought us our order was nice. If I have a couple more experiences with rude employees then I would consider not returning. Mickey white and garganelli pastas are delicious. Pineapple Express and big star pizzas are great. To federal pizza please make sure your employees are welcoming and nice. No reason have rude people working for you."}
{"text":"We love Federal Pizza as well as all of the other Upward Projects restaurants. We have been coming to them since we moved three years ago and have never had a bad experience. We tried the wedge salad tonight.... delicious and the manifesto pizza. That is our go to favorite. I also love the $5 before 5 pm wine coolers. I am sure they are all good but the blueberry hibiscus is delicious. I have never tried another one. I love sitting on the dog friendly patio and seeing the dogs. The service tonight was excellent."}
{"text":"I believe that a great experience is often times the occurrence of  many chance happenings. Federal Pizza is what I like to call urban hipster style! Everyone I seen was attractive lol looked like an urban outfitters catalog I loved it.   The staff was pleasant mostly women, very knowledgable funny & have up great recommendations. I ate during happy hour & the beer/wine is only $5 dollars everyday! & served in ridiculous sized mugs. It was grand. The pizza was good too similar to that of LGO but slightly better. Let's not forget the atmosphere; valet parking amazing pandora or spotify radio stations. I heard my jams throughout my meal. A well spent afternoon."}
{"text":"One of the best dinning and takeout options in uptown. Federal Pizza has a beautiful interior and patio. Unsurprisingly the menu is mostly pizza but they also offer some variety in the form of pastas, sandwiches and salads. Dining in is a great experience and the take out is quick and just as delicious. I prefer dining in because they have a great happy hour special.   The Big Star pizza is a must try for anyone who looking for something completely unique. It is my favorite menu item complete with all the veggies and meats one could ask for. Perfection! I have also had the Manifesto and Casanova. Both of which were also very good. As far as appetizers the green olives and the avocado are also great choices."}
{"text":"Staff - awesome, attentive, and unselfish. I was greeted before I could fully cross the threshold and had random folks refill my water and ask if I needed anything. Matt, by bartender, upgraded my pint to a pitcher (same price in HH) but served in my pint glass two perfect Porters  Pizza was awesome! Even passed the leftover for breakfast test next morning."}
{"text":"I had to try this place as I frequent the other upward project restaurants. I stopped here for lunch with a girlfriend.The place is right next to postino central. Very cute decor inside, modern, trendy, but yet casual. They have the same happy hour drink specials as postino with $5 pitchers, glasses of wine, but also offered homemade wine coolers that looked quite interesting and will definitely try next time. They offer very unique pizza combinations from broccolini with goat cheese and roasted corn to Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes. (Range from $11-14) We opted for their lunch special which was a great deal. It comes with a half size pizza (full size is good for one person) and also half a salad of your choice. I went for the big star (schreiners sausage, peppers, mushrooms, pepperoni, and their cheese blend) very tasty! And half the TLC salad (pear,apple, pecorino, citrus shallot vinegarette) awesome once again. All that for $9.99 was well worth it!  We still had room for dessert and tried the bombellinis (fried sugar doughnuts with chocolate dipping sauce) soooo perfect!!! Don't pass those up! Service was great. Although it was pretty empty anyway. The server was extremely helpful, kind, and upbeat :) hopefully it's the same when it's more busy.  Will definitely be back again probably during happy hour to try those wine coolers, more pizza, and those bombellinis!  Make me the happiest girl and bring this one to Gilbert too, Upward Projects!!!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this restaurant! EVERYTHING I've had is so delicous, from the pizza to the salads and the world's greatest fingerlings! The sauce to dip the fingerlings is unlike any dipping sauce you'll ever have. I come to this restaurant sometimes simply because I am craving the fingerlings. I am not a big pizza person and yet I love this place. I feel that says A LOT about the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this new pizza place.  Finally got in last night and boy was it a surprise. The pizza was g-r-e-a-t !!  I mean really great!!  We ordered two large, one pepperoni and one meatball.  The meatball was especially good !!  The size was smaller than expected but no matter.  The flavor made up for it and besides we ended up taking some home anyway. So I guess the size was perfect.  The place itself was very nice.  Trendy, music playing- loud. So if it's quiet ambiance you're after, this is not the place.  We had to lean forward and repeat several times to have conversation with each other.   It is definitely a trendy loud hip place I guess you'd call it.  The people were exceptionally nice.  It felt as if we had been there before by the way they interacted with us, which was welcoming.  The one girl in particular who told  us she was new brought our pizza and asked if we wanted fresh mozzarella on top.  We said yes, she came with the mozzarella and started shaving some on top.  Then about 1/3 of the block broke off and fell on top of one of the pizzas.  We laughed because it was unexpected and she was so adorable about it and kept doing her thing.  Sweet!  She was so cute I liked her a lot and SHE IS THE REASON I'd go back notwithstanding the great pizza itself.  So I hope she got a large portion of the very nice tip we left.  I don't remember her name, but I'll remember next time.  I would go back and would recommend any pizza lover to go here, it's great!  I gave 4 stars just because of the loudness.  They could stand to turn down the volume a little, not a lot, just a little."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place, for sure!  The pizza comes close to Pizzeria Bianco (not quite, but close).  I've tried a few different vegetarian pizzas and have never been disappointed.  The house salad is delicious -- simple with a tasty dressing.  They have yummy appetizers -- corn coins and olives are my favorite.   It's fun to sit at the pizza bar and watch the folks cook too.  They have a decent booze selection as well."}
{"text":"Cool Place, Great Staff, and AWESOME Music....The Sweet Potato pizza is the business!!! Just try it! The wine coolers are great as well. Can't wait to go back and eat there again"}
{"text":"This is a great pizza place.  There was no wait, even with 7 of us, which is awesome since they weren't taking reservations when I called.  They have great happy hour specials ($5 pitchers!) but unfortunately that only goes until 5 PM.  Prices overall are very good for what you get.  The food is excellent.  Everyone was happy with their pizzas, and we had enough leftovers to have lunch for the next day.  I would definitely recommend this for the next time you're in the area and in the mood for pizza.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The atmosphere is nice and relaxing with soft lighting and tastefully chosen furniture and art. Great rotating craft beer selection on draft. The pizzas are somewhat pricy but yummy and perfect for two people to share. Great salads also. Service has always been friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in to the moment you finish your last delicious bite, Federal Pizza is a fun and awesome place to be.  The introductions are hilarious, the waitstaff balances courteous service with hilarious interjections, and the food is delicious.  I like the variety of pizzas, and the environment is friendly and clean.  Really under-emphasized when reading lists of places to eat on Central. Take some friends and check it out!  If you park in the back, you'll be next to the bakery and can get a cookie on your way out."}
{"text":"As a family, we consider ourselves to be pizza snobs. My husband was raised on Pizzeria Bianco so he is not willing to ever waste his time on bad pizza. For some reason, we had always steered away from trying Federal. Maybe it was because it's the same owners of Postino and they do bruschetta so well we thought there was no way they could do pizza well? I'm honestly not sure, but 2 weekends ago we decided we wanted to go somewhere new for date night and landed on Federal. We were NOT disappointed!  I had the pizza (can't remember the name) that comes with arugula, ricotta cheese, figs, and proscuitto and it might be my new favorite meal. My husband had another pizza that was equally as good (I can't remember what he had because I was way too interested in my own food) and a coffee beer that he said was the best coffee beer he had ever had. Our service was great, the food was bomb, and we loved it so much we decided to come back last weekend with my sister in law!  My sis in law happens to be gluten free and it can be challenging for her to find good pizza, but apparently this place hit the spot. She said that their GF dough was as good as the real thing, which is saying a lot if you know anyone who is GF."}
{"text":"I really don't see what the excitement is all about. I have now given them two chances and was not impressed either time. The service has always been great, as well as the atmosphere, but I am not impressed with the food. My first time I ordered the chef's special pizza so I took that into consideration since it was a little more quirky than I prefer but this last time I went basic and was still not impressed. The pepperoni was WAY too salty and completely ruined my pizza. And this is coming from someone who puts salt on everything. Also, the crust is completely flavorless, I think actual air might taste better. Add the veggies and polenta sticks to your Salty McSalty meal and an IV might be required in order to restore your hydration.   Sorry Federal, I really want to love you and your 'walking distance from my home' but we are certainly not friends yet. I have heard the sausage pizza is really good so maybe I will give it another shot but I am pretty sure the crust isn't changing :("}
{"text":"Oh. My. Lanta. I loved the food. We had the burrata, tlc salad and Casanova pizza. The burrata with the slightly charred bread. Oh so good. Lovely lovely salad with beets, nuts and pears. And my fave was the pizza. Mmmmm. Arugula, dates, proscuitto and ricotta. Reminded me of one of my favorite Spanish tapas - dates stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon. I heart you, Federal Pizza."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! They have salad, pasta and pizza and all are delicious! Service is always outstanding and staff are friendly. The atmosphere is great too! Highly recommend this restaurant! And don't leave without trying the Bombolini! It's to die for! They serve beer, wine and wine coolers (no other alcohol)."}
{"text":"So I stopped in late on Thursday, with an out of town work buddy, because it had been a really rough week.  We sat outside (heavenly!) and drank wine and had some apps.  The Burrata and Olive appetizers were both heavenly.  We also ordered the Casanova and splurged on the fruit crisp...thanks for helping up both regain the will to live, Federal!"}
{"text":"Other than the fact that it gets so loud that its hard to have a conversation, I really like this place. The pizza is delicious, service was good, and the atmosphere is fun. Who would ever thought to put brussel sprouts on a pizza? Definitely a place to hit up in the Central Corridor."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar with my gf and we enjoyed everything that we ate. The service at the bar was attentive and friendly, the pizza was great as well as the ambience. Will defiently be back."}
{"text":"We love going to this spot. Smokin deal mid week on wine and pizza. Super cool ambiance - service is great, so is food"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars for their food. Their pizza was wonderful. However, the service there was horrible. My waiter pretty much forgot about me, hardly ever checked on my table and never refilled my drinks. I'd rather have an over caring waiter or waitress attend to me than one who doesn't care at all. Over all the atmosphere of this place was good. If you like good pizza and don't mind crappy service, then I'd try this place."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is in business. Absolutely the most disgusting \"pizza\" ever made. I had a $50 gift card so I thought I would give it a try. Glad I didn't spend my money on it. BTW there is still $22 left on the gift card and I will never use it."}
{"text":"By far my favorite pizza joint!  Great location, great casual atmosphere, drinks, and fabulous pizza.  A bit pricier than your average pizza place, but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Tonight (Friday) was our first time to try Federal Pizza. After reading the rave reviews on here, we were excited! That excitement dwindled the minute we were put on a wait.   We sat outside to wait and all of a sudden a brunette bar tender comes storming out of the restaurant with the manager, cussing up a storm. She complained about Chris (I guess another bar tender) for a good 10 minutes - about how he would cuss her out in front of guests, how she was going to leave immediately if the manager didn't send Chris home and more ranting.   After that episode we were seated inside and literally waited TWELVE minutes before we were greeted. Yes it was a Friday night, but they were half full at the time. Being a waitress myself, I was appalled no one had even stopped by.  We ordered the chop salad which is incredibly small for $10.   Honestly - the wait staff really didn't have it together. They seemed completely unorganized. A waitress came up and asked if we wanted to look at a dessert menu and we didn't even have our pizza on the table! Seriously?   The pizza was good - small, but had a nice flavor.   Overall, the service was terrible. Since my husband and I frequent Postino's quite often, I expected much better service. Bartenders - get your shit together."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite pizza place in the Valley, great service and great food! I've been here multiple times with different sized groups and never been disappointed.  The cassanova pizza here is the best, I would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"This might be my favorite restaurant in Phoenix right now. My boyfriend and I have had multiple wonderful experiences here. The food is always SO good - mussels are a must have. I love the vibe, and I like the staff's attitude: casual, friendly and often a bit playful. I regularly spend more here than at any other restaurant. My only gripe, and it's a small one, is wtf is that wall of apostrophes? It's so random and unattractive hahah"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Always delivers every time we go.  We only go on Mon. and Tues. evenings after 8p to take advantage of their epic pizza + beer/wine deal. Solid pizza and a pitcher of good beer? Hell yes!  Pizza is good. Crust is a bit soggy from time to time, but not chewy. They do have some repugnant, overly hip pizzas on the menu, but the meatball and peppers is our go to.   Service is always good, sometimes great. On point staff. Love the restaurant inside and out. Very low key and comfortable.   The mastermind for all 5 of the spots in this area really has it dialed in. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat and drink in town."}
{"text":"New favorite happy hour spot! We had wine (Sean Minor Pinot Noir... wonderful stuff...) & pitcher of beer for 5 each. We tried the little gem caesar, federal chop salad and side of beets. Federal chop was the favorite, we had the big star pizza and I loved the olives (really great flavor deep emerald green olives). Crust was good, maybe not as spectacular as a NYC pizza oven, but close.   Beautiful space. From what I saw you can sit outside, inside in booths (most booths are for smaller parties but I did see one large booth) at the bar and at a smaller bar by the kitchen. I think the parking might be valet for dinner... but at happy hour it appeared to be self park.   The service is top notch, it's actually why I wanted to write this review. Our server was great and so were all the food runners, bartenders and other servers we interacted with (really rare among good looking hospitality industry peeps in phoenix). Oh, and we live walking distance away and I am wishing they had a bike rack... Service is so stellar... my boyfriend (who is a chef) and I are still talking about it."}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix, my friend introduced me to Federal Pizza. OMG! Loved this restaurant. It was a refreshing break from all the chain restaurants in the Phoenix suburbs where we had been staying.  Funky atmosphere. Very friendly service. Reasonable prices. The best veggie lasagna I've ever had. The polenta sticks were awesome as well.  Everyone at our table loved their food."}
{"text":"Federal's \"Casanova\" pizza may just be my favorite pizza of all time. Savory prosciutto, spicy arugula, and then little bits of sweetness from the ricotta & dates ... pizza perfection. I could have a Casanova pizza every day and be one happy camper.  But seriously, I've been here multiple times, and each time the food and service has been excellent. I'm not a huge fan of pineapple pizza in general, but I tried their \"Pineapple Express\" for the first time yesterday, and now I've officially found one that I've liked and would even order again.   I've also done takeout and taken advantage of their drive-through (!), which is super convenient and also allows you to avoid the cramped parking lot / valet."}
{"text":"Very delicious!  The Burrata and crostini is The Bomb!  The Burrata is super creamy and melts in your mouth.  The crostini is the perfect compliment.  The pizza is very good. We had the four cheese with mushrooms.  Fantastic.  I wouldn't say it's the best pizza I've ever had, but it sure is close and I cannot wait to go back and try a Stromboli.  The service deserves 5 stars just on it's own. The entire staff was super friendly.  We cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"I was a fan of Federal before, but now that they've started a new late night special on Mondays and Tuesdays, I've fallen head over heels in love! A pizza plus a bottle of wine (or two pitchers of beer) for just $20 after 8pm. Best of all, the deal is available for takeout too. It's really an incredible deal. You're basically paying retail for the wine and getting the pizza for free!  And it's really good pizza. It might even be my favorite, but I can't bring myself to make that kind of statement on the record. The crust is so flavorful and crisp. I'm glad they don't shellac it in oil like they do at LGO, another contender in my favorite pizza category. While Grimaldi's might be my favorite pizza close to home, Federal really has them beat when it comes to toppings. I've had the sweet potato, veggie, potato and date pizzas so far, and I've loved them all.  Is there a way to bottle the wine coolers to go? If I could get a growler full of the watermelon mint variety, my summer would be complete."}
{"text":"I just moved down here to this area. So I biked here. from my place off of 4th n roosevelt.   I met my neighbor, had a few beers and pizza. It was a joy to enjoy pizza this good, and I'm from Brooklyn, NY.   I recommend anyone in the area that enjoys pizza and beer to stop here."}
{"text":"Recently came here for dinner because I received an email from upward projects for a free pizza from Federal Pizza. Upward projects generally has cool concept restaurants with good food so we decided to try it out.  The restaurant is located across from Windsor, another upward project restaurant, and like all of them, it has a cool, hip vibe with a cute little patio.   As for the food, we tried the \"big star\" pizza & the \"tlc\" salad. I gotta say...food was great! The big star pizza is a wood fired pizza with a yummy combo of toppings...sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms & olives...I can see why they call it the \" big star\". And the salad was a nice refreshing blend of arugula, spring greens, beets, pears, almonds, fennel and cheese all tossed in a light citrus shallot vinaigrette...yum!   So if you've been to the other upward project restaurants & like them, this will be another one you will like too :)"}
{"text":"I will be dreaming of the pizza I had here for weeks to come. My Labor Day weekend vacay to visit friends in Arizona was basically a gigantic tour of all the wonderful food that Phoenix has to offer. They definitely knew how to sell their city.   So, here we have Federal Pizza, a place that seems to have floated into a Portland Portal and ended up here. Part of a grouping of amazing restaurants all owned by the same people, Federal Pizza definitely brings something different to the table. Unique. Affordable (like everything in this state). Comfortable setting. Gender neutral bathrooms. Staff with tattoos everywhere. Killer food and drinks made from scratch. Perfect vibe.   There were two awesome Must Taste Items on the menu:  1. Homemade \"Wine Coolers,\" in several flavors. I tried the apple cider and strawberry rhubarb. Had a hard time choosing which one was better. Mmmm.   2. PIZZA. Very VERY Mod Friendly Pizza. We did a meatball pizza with sliced POTATOES and CORN, and a veggie pizza with onions, garlic, and ROASTED brussels sprouts.   You basically choose everything on it, kind of like the blaze/blast/pieology craze we have here in Sac, BUT it has thicker, delicious crust and is slow baked the regular way.  One of the best pizza experiences I've ever had, and I've had me a lot of pizza experiences.  Freakin' Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food and to top it all, great service.   It is always good experience for me especially seating at the bar when either Chris or Josh are working.   Keep up the good work Federal!"}
{"text":"I am so lucky to live in the Upward Projects Group Triangle--With the addition of Federal Pizza--my little part of the world has three great restaurants in walking distance--Federal Pizza is my favorite because i don't have to cross central and its the closest to my house.:)   Anyway--on to the food we shared a salad and a pizza and both hit a perfect note--salad had beets and pears in a great citrus vinaigrette--just enough to clear the palate--tonite we had a margherita pizza--crust was perfectly done and held up under the flavorful juicy tomatoes-- my only suggestion is that I would appreciate if there were a couple of wines by the glass and a price point closer to 7 instead of 9--but other than that--the restaurant itself is great looking as well, casual and modern.  It was also nice to see lots of folks who seem to know each other--certainly a great addition to  our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Flash back to about a week ago. My friend invited me to dinner here because she had a coupon and they had a special going on. Double deal (we thought). She raved about the pizza so I was pretty excited... Who doesn't love carb night?! We sit down right away and the waitress flies by and explained the drink specials in a way that didn't make sense to even my friend that had been there before! We wait and wait and finally put our order in. This is the last time we see the waitress for a long time. Some other guy brings out our wine and we quickly realize that the table/sidewalk is slanted and the bottle and are glasses are headed in the direction of the ground. Same guy finally brings out our pizza. Pizza is super soggy and my friend had to ask for ranch 3 times. It was just ok. Disappointing actually with it being so soggy.   Waitress dropped on bill and disappeared for another long period of time. We put out my card and my friends coupon. Waitress says they can't take coupon during a time they offer \"specials\" even though the coupon does not say this at all. She looks at my friend and asks if she just wants to run HER card. Big mistake. Never assume who is paying the bills, especially with her bad attitude. She runs my card still and I asked to speak with the manager about the coupon issue. Waitress says \"I just keep striking out with you guys!\" I respond yes even though her interaction was so minimal it was rather pathetic. This manager could care less about any customer satisfaction. In fact I don't think he cared about the business in general. All I got was a smug look that he got what he wanted. In the end I didn't give the waitress who didn't do anything a tip (which I hate doing).   This was truly a heinous experience.  And with the sheer number of people that talk to me everyday  about where I travel and restaurants I visit I have so far and will continue to tell everyone to avoid this place. Go to Cibo (or Pizza Hut) instead."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Federal Pizza last night for a cheat night meal. He ordered the Big Star and I got the Casanova and added Pancetta. The pizzas were amazing and definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"By far, THE best pizza ever! Seriously! The crust is slightly crispy, and the pizza just melts in your mouth!  Great, fun environment for the whole family. Great indoor and outdoor patio space. I've always had wonderful and friendly service here. They also have a drive up window, so order ahead and just drive up and pick up the best pizza in town :) Doesn't get better than that!  Also, who doesn't love wine and pizza night? Great price, great food, it's a must try!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good but the rest of the food leaves a lot to be desired.  Good beer on tap. The one thing I couldnt get over was that it seemed dark in there.  They use ambient light during the day and there isnt enough.  Parking is decent though."}
{"text":"Federal Pizza is incredible. Out of five stars it deserves ten, all day long.  Amazing food, spectacular service, beautiful ambiance.   The pizza here made me completely redo my Phx pizza rankings. This place is just impossible to beat. The cherry on top is that they have call ahead AND drive thru service. You can get world class pizza and beer, without leaving your car. What a world we live in.  Give Federal Pizza a shot, you and your taste-buds will be ecstatic that you did!"}
{"text":"Federal Pizza is north of camelback on the west side of central.  It is clean, trendy, and hip.  The music is fresh and they play hip hop and modern rock.  The servers are welcoming and professional.    We ordered burrata, olives, the five star, and the manifesto.  The burrata was Amazing. Fresh, soft, silky with some olive oil and crisp bread.  The olives were excellent and had a touch of sea salt.  The five star pizza had sausage, pepperoni, bell pepper, mushrooms, and onions.  It had tons of flavor and the crust was excellent.  The manifesto had goat cheese, sausage, fennel, and mushrooms and was just as good and savory.  The goat cheese put it over the top.  The price was spot on.  Worked out to be 50 bucks with drinks.  I would have given it five stars but the table was wet, the waitress brought me a frozen glass for my sculpin ipa (alcohol abuse), and they didnt take discover card.  I would definitely come back and recommend this place to others.  Well executed food and nice spot to visit.  Well done."}
{"text":"Federal gets five stars for delivering top notch service and awesome craft beer! The food is always consistently delish! Only one recommendation..... Love the bambolinis.... Would love to see a half order of bambolinis on the menu!  Love ya guys! Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"I was hoping for something more.  Lunch, on a Friday, was very busy and loud.  I like a restaurant that smells like good food.  What first assaulted my nose was a familiar, but not pleasant smell.  We finally realized it smelled like olives.  It was a briny, olivey odor.  We ordered the pizza with Brussel sprouts and  pancetta.  Again, although tasty, it smelled like baby cabbages.  I think the place lacks ambiance."}
{"text":"Federal pizza is delicious. Every time I come here, everyone is so nice! I've never had a bad host/server here. Great job on customer service.  They're food here is STELLAR! I've had the pepperoni pizza, margherita pizza, cassanova pizza, lil' triple dessert, and bomolini dessert! All of it was delicious and was fair in price.  Have you ever been to a pizza place that has a drive-thru? Yeah, me neither. Well Federal stands out because they have a drive thru and it's AWESOME! I don't have to get up out of my car to get my pizza! YESSSSSSSSSS!  I love you Federal. XOXO"}
{"text":"This place is great. It is next to Windsor. I give it 5 stars for everything. Well done. Once again.  Owners: Craig DeMarco, Owner of Postino Winecafe. `Opening day for Windsor and Churn is scheduled for Monday, April 25, 2011. `Federal Pizza Opening Monday, October 22, 2012.  Met one of the Chefs, 'Monster.' He was intense and forthcoming. A fellow human with zest and energy should be mentioned in everyday conversation.   He recommended the Casanova (Prosciutto + Dates + Ricotta + Arugula+ Pecorino 14) also the Sweet Potato (Sweet Potato+ Sage + Ricotta 13)  If you are Vegan he recommends:  `Brussels Sprout (Roasted Brussels Sprouts + Pancetta + Manchego + Roasted Garlic + Lemon Zest 13)   `At Last (Broccolini + Roasted Corn + Goat Cheese + Fresno Chilis + Basil + Lemon Zest 13)  Also, if you have not already succumb to the Paleo diet, and you can imbibe the sweet pinch and light taste of carbs, then eat this.  `Garganelli (Broccolini + Lemon Basil Pesto + Pine Nuts + Oven Roasted Tomatoes + Red Pepper + Pecorino 11)  `OrECchietti (Schreiner's Sausage + Swiss Chard + Shallot Herb Broth 11)  Enjoy.

{"text":"Absolutely amazing pizza but the grilled artichoke is to die for. A definite must for any pizza lover"}
{"text":"It is no secret that I'm a huge fan of this restaurant group - Postino's, Windsor, and now Federal Pizza all have prominent spots on my date-night list.    I was lucky enough to be dining out with a birthday girl during their first week, so we snagged a reservation.  It was awesome to skip through the long wait and get straight to the good stuff.  Our server was just the right percentage hipster without being too much.  He was friendly and knowledgable, and we had a few good laughs with him throughout the night.    We ordered the burrata appetizer, which was delicious, but we needed more bread to go with it.  Don't be skimpy, Federal!  The date, ricotta, and arugula pizza was incredibly delicious, but was a tad heavy on the dates and needed more prosciutto.  I'm more of a fan of the fig spread that can be found at Postino's... the dates are just a bit too chewy and strong.  A swap out would be good!  Best part?  The absolutely divine homemade wine coolers.  The combination of flavors were perfect (we sampled them all between all of the girls at our table).  This alone would make me return!   Well done, Federal.... well done."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and this place was already on my itinerary. I was excited to try the grapefruit ginger wine cooler, and it did no disappoint. I had the Casanova pizza. I loved the use of ricotta and dates. It was such a unique combination and I am still thinking about it. Yum! I had the grilled artichoke as well, but it wasn't quite what I expected. Everything was good, but man the pizza was divine. I would gladly go again."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite new pizza place!  The food was awesome and the customer service even better!  Such a great experience, we're going back in a few weeks for my birthday!"}
{"text":"Phoenix is apparently the pizza capital, so I have gathered some recommendations from my coworkers since I'm new to Arizona. Federal Pizza is by far the most agreeable top pizza joint in Phoenix amongst my group of friends.  The dim lights and classy wooden architecture makes it a great place for family, friends, or any other occasions. They also have a to go option.   I have picked the pineapple express because pizza is always better with pineapples. This is not fake news. In addition to the juicy pineapples, the hand crafted pizza consist of prosciutto, calabrian chili, and chives where an explosion of flavor is experienced in each bite. With no shame, I have demolished the entire 12inch pizza by myself in one setting. 2,000+ calories later, I still highly recommend this place. I'm happy to continue my search for the best pizza in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Been here twice second time pizza was a little soggy, great atmosphere, nice wait staff, great apps good wine.  Try it"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is top notch, atmosphere, service, and food is second to none.  Will definately be coming back time and time again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and service has always been top notch, even with a party of 8! Everyone is super friendly and on top of that their food is always great! Love their style of pizza, not too thin or thick crust, a perfect chewiness, very flavorful toppings and sauce. I also love their polenta sticks with the red pepper sauce they serve along it. Yum!! Always a good time when coming here"}
{"text":"At last pizza is really good. Blueberry hibiscus wine cooler is awesome. Quick service."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Phoenix! The food is awesome and the staff are always super quick and nice. The hostess usually over estimates how long your wait will be, which I think is a good thing. Last weekend I was told it would be 1 hour, but since someone takes your drink order while you wait, it was no problem. We ended up being sat right when we got our drinks - it couldn't have been more than 20 minutes or so.   The burrata is a must. It pretty much melts in your mouth. What I like most about Federal is how easy they are about subbing and changing their pizzas. Obviously you can make your own, but if you want to sub out things on pre-designed pies, it's no big deal.  I usually go for the manifesto and add an egg on top. If you're into eggs on things it's a must try here. One funny thing is that they don't have hard liquor - only wine and beer. However, they have a selection of house made wine coolers. Grapefruit ginger is perfect for summer."}
{"text":"After only reading the rants & raves, I finally came in to experience Federal myself. MIND. BLOWN. Or taste buds. Whatever.  As many have said before me... not surprised by how good this place is based on its creators. If it is possible for food to not only look but TASTE beautiful... this pizza is proof. There are so many exquisite flavor combinations to choose from it's hard to narrow it down to one decision - which is why I suggest you do what I did and bring friends to order everything else you want off the menu and then share all of it.  We had the Sweet Potato pizza (sweet potatoes, ricotta, and sage) and the Margherita (fresh basil and roasted tomatoes). I don't usually like tomatoes as a pizza topping but, HAVE MERCY, this pizza is probably the best pizza I have ever had. Ever. Watch out, Italy.  The house made wine coolers are also ridiculous. Making it a point to go back until I try every single one... at least a few times."}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to take the family and some close friends and check this place out for lunch. It's been on my list of new places to try out for a long time. Not to mention we had a $50 gift that was screaming to be used up.  This location is a masterfully transferred old federal bank building that used to do business here in another lifetime. It has everything from the old drive thru to the super old metal covered parking area for the previous bank employees.  Inside is themed with the current hipster vibe and they did a great job exploring ways to make both the decor and the food interesting and great tasting at the same time.  We started with several appetizers and decided to share most the food. Ordered the F&A Veg Board, the Wedge Salad and two plates of the Arancini. They were all very delicious and left us in the mood for some main entrees.  Next we decided on the Lamb Bolognese, a Big Star Pizza, a Meatball Pizza and a Casanova Pizza. Everything was very good and we really enjoyed all the fresh ingredients. Even the grand kids did a great job of polishing off their portions.  The pizzas were also tasty but the dough and crust were not anything special and different than what we were used to eating. We all generally agreed that we preferred more of a Chicago or NY style pizza crust during our drive back home.  Service was friendly and the food came out hot and ready to eat. We did have a small problem trying to talk over the loud music. My wife even ask them to turn it down a little bit and had no luck. The music was so loud in the bathroom that I started having psychedelic flashbacks from my college days. Nice!  Overall we had a fun time and would most likely go back again. Get your buns over here and show this place your dance moves. They also have a large selection of spirits and other alcoholic beverages that you can enjoy. Maybe the loud music is more appealing when you are three sheets to the wind? BEER ME!  3.75 STARS"}
{"text":"I live in Austin TX. First time, we went to Phoenix, was hungry for pizza, found Federal Pizza place. First bite, I almost choked because it was so good that I couldn't believe what I was eating...After that we came back to Austin, trying to find a good pizza place which compatible to Federal Pizza, but we could never found any good pizza compare to that. Now we go back to Phoenix for pizza when we want a good pizza. Wish we had good pizza like that in Austin TX."}
{"text":"First visit here - their lunch duo for $10.50 is the best deal in Phoenix. The service was inintrusive but outstanding. Had the 1/2 Manifesto pizza and 1/2 Federal Chop salad and was not disappointed. Partner had the whole Pineapple Express pizza and a side salad and they were winners also. The best part is you can park right there. None of the valet parking nonsense that is happening all over Phoenix. If the restaurant requires you to valet then I don't spend my money there. Excellent place to eat and we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Food was delish and service was Awesome!!! We had the Casanova,  Big Star and Pinapple pizza!!  Thanks Nicole"}
{"text":"Lots of already great reviews, so I'll keep it simple.   My! I love what you've done with the place FP! Looks like it was once a drive-thru bank...thus the name \"Federal\" Pizza. Ceilings are partly exposed, partly textured. Awesome light fixtures. Interior is well done!   Burrata appetizer - Amazing...could have eaten the entire thing alone. MINE!! Don't forget to enjoy the basil \"garnish\" with the cheese. It really brings out the flavor.   Corn \"coins\"  appetizer - Meh! Next.   Cassanova Pizza - VERY good but the a typical ricotta, date and arugula pie.  Brussel Sprout Pizza - My favorite mostly because it was unique. Little bit of a lemony tang on the sprouts + salty from the pancetta. Also could have eaten alone! MINE! MINE!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So far it's amazing!!!!! A short wait, good music and just been seated! Great servers!  I know this is silly but their Coke is perfect!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints me! Foods always great, no matter what i have tried, its all been amazing! Love the atmosphere and the staff are so great! Don't forget to try the berry cobbler....its beyond delicious."}
{"text":"If I were cruel, I would say that the pizza crust is orgasmic and just end the review here.    But, I'm feeling generous so...  go here.  Today.  They had a great beer list as well as homemade wine coolers.  I had the blueberry hibiscus and it a perfect concoction.  The margherita pizza was delicious.  They were not stingy with the cheese or the basil.  My husband had the sweet potato and ricotta pizza.  He quite enjoyed it and considering he's not the biggest pizza fan, that's kind of a big deal.  We shared the 'Lil Triple for dessert and it was wonderful as well.  Oreo crust, chocolate creme and toasted marshmallow...    Service was a teensy bit slow but to be fair, they were quite busy.  It was a beautiful day outside but we opted to sit inside as the patio was quite loud since it's on the street.    I realized shortly after being seated that this must be the brainchild of the same folks who run Windsor and I was correct.  (I think the gum wrappers in the sugar containers may have given it away.)    Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great place, excellent food and happy hour prices that can't be beat! A large variety of beers and super scratchmade wine coolers!"}
{"text":"Nice place to have lunch.   Got the Modesto pizza, substituted the goat cheese and fennel for olives and pineapple.  Asian chili and mild wings - Better than the pizza in my opinion. Drumsticks are very meaty. Only downside was that the carrots were really soft."}
{"text":"Service was fast and amazing. Food was delicious. Will definitely be going again. We got the meatball pizza. The fingerling potatoes as an app. Mild wings were the best wings I've ever had."}
{"text":"Pizza .  Amazing .  Homemade wine coolers.  Amazing .  Nice music playing.  Nice patio.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I proudly demolished almost an entire margherita pizza from Federal the other night and don't regret a single bite. Decent beer selection, great service, crowded but pleasant atmosphere, and a creative pizza menu.   On Mondays and Tuesdays Federal offers a pizza, 2 pitchers of beer or 1 carafe of wine for $20."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local pizza place! The prices are comparable to any other pizza joint in the valley, but their pizza surpasses them all. They also have a grilled veggie board served with a slightly tangy dipping sauce that accompanies the vegetables perfectly. While some frown on dipping pizza in ranch dressing, I highly suggest ordering a side or two of their garlic ranch...it's scrumptious! My husband and I always order the same pizza which is the Big Star, no olives. This pizza comes with a plethora of veggies, schreiners sausage, and red sauce. Our friends ordered the meatball pizza and raved about it as well.   The atmosphere is hip and cool with a large bar and booths that run down the middle of the restaurant. An open kitchen is on the North side of the restaurant allowing guests to watch their pizzas being made. They also have a quaint outside area if you prefer to enjoy this beautiful Phoenix weather.   If you are too busy to dine in, call in your growler and pizza order and visit the drive-through. While I prefer dining in, this is a great option!"}
{"text":"My wife and I live less than a mile from Federal Pizza and never had a chance to give it a try. Well, it was a hot and sunny afternoon on a Sunday and we figured it was worth the short drive.   Upon arrival, I noticed the plentiful parking, especially the covered parking spaces...no doubt, from the building's former life as a Federal Savings & Loan.  As soon as I stepped in I immediately knew we were in for a great experience. The interior is bright, casual, and unique in furniture and decor. The booths are perfect for two. The service was great, multiple servers eager to take our drink orders. I ordered the Pilsner from the Czech Republic which was on draft. Delicious!   We ate the Mister Mister app, which consists of fried vegetables (it is delicious and unique). As for pizza, we got the Manifesto. Again, it was great. Saucy, not overdone with toppings, and the pizza dough was crispy and light. We finished it off with a doughnut and chocolate dip dessert. This place exceeded my expectations. I'm not a huge fan of italian/pizza joints but this is a fantastic lunch/dinner choice and is casual enough that you want to come back over and over. I like this place better than The Parlor. Overall 9/10."}
{"text":"We wanted to sit outside. Had to wait 45 minutes even though there were empty tables. Grabbed a beer at the bar while we waited. Not a very good bartender. Not helpful explaining the various IPA beers. Seemed frustrated by our questions.   Finally seated.  It was sonority inside with really bad music that we hoped sitting outside would be better. Only minimally. Not sure how anyone can carry on a conversation in this place!  Pizzas were ok. Had heard about the Brussels sprout pizza so tried it. Hardly any sprouts on the pie. Very unimpressed. Never had water refills.   Won't be back. Way better places to spend our time and money in in this city of great pizza joints."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and sandwiches. My friends and I ordered the meatball trio to split and it was divine with the polenta. Good service and great food!"}
{"text":"Very good food its my second time there and i loved the food both times cant go wrong with the pizza we also got wings and some potato thing they were very good my husband is kind of picky when it comes to food and service he was satisfied with both and the lemonade is amazing"}
{"text":"I genuinely love most pizza places. This one falls right into my love for pizza.   However my first trip here was with a group of co-workers and the service was flat out awful. She was rude and forgetful. She forgot to put one of our pizza orders in now granted the manager made up for it and sent us back to work with a couple of free pizzas.   I did decide to them another chance and just chalk my first experience up to a once in a blue moon mistake. Every experience after that was amazing. The pizza a lit more greasy than I would like but otherwise great food. The service has been amazing since and it also helps that I have only been waited on by male servers."}
{"text":"Great place for beer and pizza! They have $5 32 ounce draft craft beers from open to 5PM. Great salads and lunch specials. Best meatballs in town!"}
{"text":"I don't go much unless my friends insist. I'm gluten free and Federal Pizza refuses to offer it. Every time I go, I ask and get a variety of reasons --from we're working on it (a year ago) to its not anything that we're planning (most recent). Tired of waiting, Spinatos, Sauce, LGO (the best GF pizza btw) will do."}
{"text":"Our first time. Amazing service! What a great team of people. They are all very attentive, know their menu well and sociable. This made a huge impression on my husband and I. We will be back for sure. Thank you, Kara, Ari and Angie! You were all so friendly.   The food was unique in the ingredient combinations. We ordered Brussels sprouts and cheese/risotto balls (Arancini) appetizers, The Magnificent sandwich, Chef's Whim pizza (chicken, collard greens, ribeye gravy, pickled watermelon, cheese), cannoli and Bombolini (homemade donuts and chocolate sauce). We loved everything we ordered. It's nice to find original menus that make you want to try everything.   Ari was kind enough to make my wine selection effortless by choosing for me. I had the new Rosè wine. Perfect pairing with my meal and refreshing.   Relaxing and casual atmosphere. We were on the patio. I usually worry about patio service but they didn't miss a beat and our drinks were always full. We were even there during a shift change and didn't feel a thing in our service. Ari was amazing and Angie stepped right in and was just as awesome. Kara stopped by to check on our experience a few times and was very personable.   This restaurant is 25 miles oneway from our home. Worth all 50 miles. We highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's now becoming my regular dinner place. Love the food and company, anyone wana join?"}
{"text":"I'm normally a more traditional type of pizza guy, but their Casanova pizza...dates, pecorino, prosciutto, and arugula was amazing.  Service was top notch.  Atmosphere was unique and even with some background music you could still have a conversation.  Great selection and prices on beer and wine.  We will definitely be going back!!!!  It has the same owners as Postino's and a similiar feel."}
{"text":"Stopped  by for a quick  lunch . The place was about half full  but got much busier.  The waiter kept  giving me water with ice when I requested  no ice.. I ordered  the wedge but  got a sliver.  I ordered  the meatball  pizza but the meet was not evenly distributed.service was average"}
{"text":"Went with my roommate for the Monday/Tuesday special, which is a pizza and two mini pitchers of beer for $20. Even at normal pricing this would have been a great deal. The food came out fast and was delicious, the service was terrific, and they have a good selection of craft beers on tap. Excellent experience, I give it 5 stars with nothing negative to say. We will be back!"}
{"text":"After hearing/reading that Federal had one of the better pies in town, we decided to give it a try for lunch when we were in that area this past Sunday.  They did a really nice job with the layout and décor, an all around inviting atmosphere.  We ate light and shared the seasonal salad and their margarita pizza adding roasted garlic and prosciutto.  The salad was a nice mix of greens and other veggies with goat cheese and avocado, everything very crisp & fresh, a nice size for one person, but we managed to make it do for two.  The pizza was wonderfully tasty with large slices of ripe beefsteak-like tomatoes that tasted like they came right out an east coast garden, and the prosciutto added just the right amount of salt and meat to make it virtually perfect.  It might have been able to stay in the oven another minute, but I'm NOT complaining!  The crust was almost perfectly crisp, and I could have licked the olive oil off the pan for dessert!  We're now fans and will be back again."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. The wildfires pizza had excellent flavor. The beer selection was pretty good too. We had no less than 3 people that served us. Never ran dry in hydration. The place isn't that big so I would reserve a day in advance. Indoor and outdoor seating. We were in town for business but if we come back I will be sure to eat there again."}
{"text":"You looking for a pizza place to go to?  While you should totally go to Federal Pizza, it is the BEST pizza place in Arizona.  They have an awesome selection of pizza's you can choice from.  So, far I have had the Meatball, Big Star, Brussels Sprout and Manifesto.    The Meatball is my favorite pizza; if you add Brussels sprouts to the pizza it's even better.   Even the staff is awesome too; they make you feel like you are only one in the restaurant.  Your water glass is always filled and the pizza comes out quick too.    It may be in central phoenix, but it is totally worth the drive.  Federal Pizza is a locally owned company.  They are part of the Upward Projects; all of their other restaurants are great too.   So, if you have not tried Federal Pizza.  Then you are totally missing out."}
{"text":"I had the best experience eating at Federal Pizza! I came here with some of my family and we all kinda shared everything from the appetizers to the pizza/pasta. I literally had some of the best food and even better service from Kiley, Veronica, Vern, Nicole and the manager Gary!!I'll definitely be back and I highly suggest everyone visits central Phoenix best prime time Italian restaurant!!! Legends !!"}
{"text":"Roasted veggie platter was very tasty...carrots, fennel, cauliflower and broccoli with a spicy mayo sauce. Brussel sprout pizza and sausage pizza were both very good but crust could have been crustier. Our waiter was great."}
{"text":"There are good reasons why this is one of my favorite pizza places: the use of top quality ingredients is reflected in their pizzas which are really good, with a pleasant just-right char along the crust edge. Appetizers are superb, there is a good selection of adult beverages, and service is friendly and efficient - all of these make Federal an excellent place for a leisurely meal or a happy hour gathering. Oh, and by the way, their super-fresh creamy burrata is addictive!"}
{"text":"This place is convenient ,they have a good salad and pizza lunch for 10.50.good salad and good pizza. .I don't like their Bacon on the salad as it is too salty. Service  is always  outstanding.  Place is very clean  but can be noisy."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pizza joint! If you haven't been here... whatcha waiting for? Best friendliest staff in town and the food??? YUMMY! Monday and Tuesday night special... Pizza and bottle of wine only $20!"}
{"text":"I am going to have to join the mainstream on this one and give this place a TOP 5 Rating.  The pizza here is sooooooo gooooood.  The staff is amazing, good specials to choose from, and great location with fairly easy parking (sitting inside is cool, but I suggest getting a patio seat when the weather is rocking).    This is a great place to ride your bike too as well.  Didn't love the meatball appetizer and would not recommend that, but everything else was top notch.  Good enough to earn my highest rating.  Go there, get the pepperoni pizza straight up and tell them Attorney Steve sent you.  have fun and FIND YOUR SIZZLE.

{"text":"I just visited this pizza place for the first time and it did not disappoint. We waited for a table for a bit, but figured the place must be that good. Everyone was friendly so big plus on the service side. I had the \"great little salad\" and \"at last\" pizza. Both were very good, so I'm looking forward to returning and trying some of their other offerings.  It has a hip vibe to it, with semi dim lights and loud music, so overall I'd recommend it as a good place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner around 6:00.   It was bustling but we were seated promptly.  We got service with water and drinks right away also.  Our server was very friendly and efficient, she gave us good feedback when we asked her about the menu items we were trying to decide between.  Our food came out quick but not overly quick to make us think we were being hustled out for some reason.  The food was delicious and plentiful.  Not enormous portions but just the right amount.  The only negative for me was  the restrooms were co-ed, co-mingled whatever you want to call it.  I don't care for that, when you have two rooms why not keep them separate?  The signs on the doors of the restrooms were cute and clever but I would prefer one gender bathrooms."}
{"text":"I have been here at least 6 times now.  Yes, I am a fan. But, I add a caveat, I am not a all out big fan.  Yes, I will take visitors to town here, but i myself would prefer to head to Pizzaria Pomo or La Piazza Locale downtown for more authentic Napolitano pizza.    I guess the loud noise, the pretentious atmosphere and staff (are tatoos a requirement for employment here?) and the a bit too exoctic pizza don't do it for me anymore.    On the plus side, It is a nice place to take first timers.  It is kind of a destination type of restaurant worth the short supply of parking, noise and location.  We enjoyed our appetizers of Burata and crustinis, grilled veggie board and the olives.  Two times I have ordered the meatballs with polenta and been disappointed both times, nothing too interesting in that dish.  So as you can see I am torn.  Interesting but not the best in town.    Extra plus note - last night they gave us the wrong pizza (it was missing onions), we had not even noticed.  They realized their mistake and brought out the correct pizza and did not charge us for it, we took it home, I had some for breakfast today and it was pretty good cold."}
{"text":"Incredible music is constantly playing. I heard the clash and Johnny Cash while eating. The porchetta sandwich is a must have and I also had the mister mister which was freaking delicious and growlers to go. This place is going to be hard to beat."}
{"text":"Fantastic, gourmet pizza in an uber-hip atmosphere inside what used to be a federal bank. Love the idea of re-using a space rather than knocking it down. The wait was very long on a Friday night, so I would recommend going at another time. But it was still fantastic. OH, and get the blackberry rosemary wine cooler. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Solid 4 Stars! We were seated rather fast on a very busy Friday night. The salad was fresh and the pizza was very tasty! The cold beer complimented a lovely evening at The Federal Pizza. Don't forget they do have a drive thru! I highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"We only had salad and pizza here, and both were great! Service was okay, drinks weren't bad at all. I loved their pizza dough. Crispy and fresh. Margherita pizza had no pizza sauce on it.  I'd say this is my #2 choice for pizza after Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"To confess, I came here only because the wait at Bianco was 2-3 hours, but I was pleased with the outcome. The beet starter was delicious - a lot of flavor packed into small dish. The grapefruit ginger and strawberry rhubarb wine coolers were wonderful - light and refreshing. My party shared two pizzas: the Big Star and the chef's daily selection, a vegetarian selection which apparently used to be a regular on the menu, with roasted corn and arugula. Both were very good although I probably would have liked a bit more corn and a tad less arugula on the latter. I'm an out-of-towner but definitely would not hesitate to return because so many other items on the menu sounded enticing. Service was efficient with two minor complaints: one of the three starters was delayed; and when I asked that the check be given to me (as opposed to someone else in my party), because of the team service model, my request wasn't fulfilled."}
{"text":"This place rocks for lunch! They have a pizza and salad special for $10.00 that allows one to pick from a yummy list of both. Frankly, for as long as I've lived in Phoenix, I'm not sure why I don't lunch here more often. This is a correction that will now happen! Excellent food and service. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious and the environment was fabulous.  But the service was so bad from one particular server today...I just can't give this place anymore than 3 stars.  We were a party of five and each person in my group was appalled at the service.  I have never left a zero tip before but just for the principle of it...all I could do today was leave her a note. I won't replay all of her issues of unfriendliness and inattentiveness on here because she's well aware of her mistakes....if not, than she's even worse than a zero tip.    We hope to return sometime but for now...take-out will be our only reason to return."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix! The crust is incredible. I highly recommend the Casanova, but Add Apples and Sausage. To die for!!!!  Only downside is parking, it's a challenge but the Pizzas worth it. Trust me!!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, it is that good!  Pizza was very good the second time though not as spectacular the first visit. I think the kitchen got rushed. But all is forgiven, Everything else is perfect. Love the chop salad. Great beer. Great wine.  Gorgeous date."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere & great service, what else is there to say?  Oh yeah & a great beer selection! We managed to get seats at the bar because the place was packed on a Friday night - always a good sign. The bartender recommended the burrata, which I was cheesy awesomeness that I would highly recommend. Our pizza was the big star, I don't normally like green olives on pizza but they added just the right amount of saltiness. Can't wait to go back & try something new!  My only real complaint was that after putting our name down for a table, the hostess seemed to lose track of us so I had to flag her down to make sure we weren't forgotten. It ended up being a non-issue when we scored two seats at the bar & had fantastic service from the staff."}
{"text":"There is something about woodfired pizzas that taste so good! The atmosphere is very cool and they have a drive-thru! Something I have never seen in San Diego. The servers and cooks are so sweet and get your food out fast!"}
{"text":"This place is always delicious, I have had almost everything on the menu and there have been NO disappointing experiences. I love the cozy feel of the place, the integration of the cobbler from churn, and the neighborhood view is always nice.the kids menu is proportionate, fair, and well priced. Always leave with a smile and a full belly. Always accommodating to large parties too."}
{"text":"Final dinner with my roommate and my best friend to cap off her New Year's visit.  And what a good choice!  For starters - how can I not adore the concept of picking up amazing food and a bottle of wine or growler or beer from a drive-thru if so desired? Admittedly super lazy, sometimes I want good food, but don't want to give up the comfort of my slippers to get it. Federal is the perfect solution!  The roommate and I shared the corn coin appetizer - not bad at all, but I think it would have been amazing if prepared more elote style. Next time I'll get the beets or sprouts instead. We also decided to split one of the pizzas. With MJ Bread responsible for the dough and Schreiner's doing the sausage, no big surprise that it was a hit! (And doing fresh grated parm from the big block directly onto the pie was a nice touch that makes a big difference to this girl!)  Also ordered was the roasted veggie board - with sprouts instead of potatoes. It was big and beautiful and super tasty! I suggest this for any celiac, vegetarian, vegan or anyone who likes amazing veggies and every combination thereof! HUGE winner in this dish!  As DD, I was sticking with iced tea - but look forward to exploring some of the beers and checking out a couple of their wine coolers.  And getting that veggie board again!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best new places in town. Excellent food, great vibe, terrific staff, valet parking, decent prices, central location. Had the broccoli pizza and the sausage pizza with a Caesar salad. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tonight's the night, bucket list time at the Federal. It's Cioppino with a frosted mug of their Amber Ale. Talk to ya later..."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back. Standout is the service!  Attentive, provide feedback, knowledgeable about the wine offerings and clear on options with pizza (such as \"feel free to do a 1/2 and 1/2 pizza!\"). We had 1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 Casanova with a Federal Chop salad.  No complaints on the quality nor quantity of any of the food.  Looking forward to a future visit and trying something new."}
{"text":"Excited to go to another Upward Projects place as Positinos and Windsor are already a favorite.  Great thin crust...and lots of unique toppings.  All the servers seemed to help each other out and were attentive, tho, no personal touch.  Busy, hopping, great location and food, tho.  I will go again."}
{"text":"I rarely give a 5 star review, but I honestly couldn't find anything wrong this place! From the menu to the service, we were kept happy during a busy lunch hour on a Friday.  I met a friend for lunch, (during  office hours) so I couldn't try any of their drinks, but their pizza selection was so intriguing that I didn't even care.  I went simple and boring...  a margherita pizza with green olives, but I thought I would see if they could get the basics right before moving on.. . They nailed it! Probably the best I've had in a really long time.  My lunch date had a \"Abbey\" Style beer which she enjoyed (Yes, right in front of me ! It's okay Mandi B. I still love you=D) and the Brussels sprout pizza with arugula and prosciutto.  She said it was delicious.  After I ordered, I smelled and saw all of these wonderful concoctions of pizza, roasted corn and salads... none of which I ordered.  I don't regret my order, but can't wait to go back and try something new.  Maybe Sweet potato and arugula pizza? Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"Got a Federal Pizza gift card for Christmas so needless to say I was eager to give this place a try.  This a pizzeria set in what used to be an old Federal bank just north of Central and Camelback.  Its one in a growing megaplex of hugely popular concept restaurants owned and operated by the group Upward Projects (purveyors of restaurants such as Windsor, Churn, Postino and Joyride Taco House).  Living in Downtown Phoenix, I'm something of a pizza connoisseur as there's great pizza everywhere.  So how does Federal stack up?  I got their margherita pizza as that's usually a good measure of comparison.  It's simple, clean, and (when done right) hits the spot.  The tomato and olive oil are notes you definitely pick up with Federal's version, though the cheese and basil are far less pronounced than other places I've tried.  Tasty, but I've had better.  For dessert, I got an order of their Bombolini.  Essentially giant donut holes you dip in chocolate sauce.  Holy moly is there a lot of sugar on those!  I probably could've wind sprinted the 3 miles back to my apartment I had such a sugar high after eating those.  Huge portion too.  I also got a four kings cheese blend pizza to go for dinner.  Once again it was a tasty pizza, but I've had similar cheese combo pizzas at other joints that can stack up pretty well.  The restaurant itself can be described as hipster or trendy chic, but its very family friendly.  The wait staff was extremely friendly and along with some fun overhead music ranging from classic rock to modern pop, the place has a very fun vibe about it.  Definitely has a modern urban neighborhood feel.  From the orange booths, to the seemingly endless bar, to the kitchen that looks right out into the restaurant, to the relaxed patio looking out towards Central Ave, this place has quintessential Upward Projects creativity written all over it.  So to summarize, five stars for the staff and the atmosphere.  But I only give three stars for the food.  From my own experience, you can find better quality pizza and sides at places like Pomo, Cibo, Pizzeria Bianco, or even La Piazza Locale.  That said, I love what Upward Projects has done with this building and the Central/Camelback corridor as a whole.  It's great to see historic structures preserved and repurposed for something new and innovative.  Can't wait to see what they come up with next!"}
{"text":"It seems this is the place hipsters go to get their pizza, kind of like how Gallo Blanco is the Hipster Macayo's.  They're so hip that they don't even put the name of the restaurant on the building!  That pretty much guarantees an overinflated Yelp rating, because a lot of hipsters have trouble thinking for themselves.  But I digress.  If you read my last few weeks' worth of reviews, you'd know that I have been eating a lot of pizza lately.  We are on a sort-of pizza quest.  I had high hopes for this one, and the menu actually looked really awesome.  I went with the Casanova, which is a white pizza with ricotta, dates, arugula, prosciutto, and pecorino.  I also had a ginger ale to drink.  The ginger ale was probably in the Canada Dry tier.  That means so flavorless that they're willing to serve it for free on an airplane.  The difference between a fountain and microbrewed soft drink is probably more profound for ginger ales than any other soft drink variety.  As far as the pie goes, the toppings were excellent.  Go here if you like the focus of your pizza to be entirely on the toppings, because the crust sucks.  It was a little too tough, and the flavor was worse than any other artisan pizza I've had.  This was not knife-and-fork pizza; it was pick-it-up-and-eat-it pizza.  That's how you know the crust is subpar.  Besides that, the ambiance is a little too modern.  When I sit down for a nice handmade pie, I like it to be warm and cozy.  This place is trendy, with loud music blasting in the restaurant.  They need to dial it down a notch.  Of all the wood-fired pizzas I have had in Phoenix, Federal was one of my least favorite.  Maybe better than Cibo, but not as good as Pomo, Bianco, or Il Bosco.  Or even Timo's flatbread pizza.  The chef might be creative, but without a good crust or a good restaurant, eclectic toppings become a bit of a gimmick."}
{"text":"I had a great time last weekend.  My hubby had been talking about Federal Pizza and I have been reading all the reviews, that I couldn't wait to visit.  We were worried we couldn't get a table, because I've heard the wait it a little long.  We decided ahead of time that we were going to sit at the bar.  When we got there, we valet, got inside and there were two seats open right in the middle of the bar area, score.  We ordered the Manifesto, and since lately I've been easing my way into beers, I asked for some advise and the recommendation was great, it was the Sierra Nevada Kellerweis, I liked it a lot.  My hubby had the Four Peaks one.  The place was buzzing with energy and the servers were working really hard.  It had been about 20 minutes after we ordered and I saw a pizza coming by, it went straight from us to another person at the bar who I thought had gotten there after us, hum, ok, maybe I didn't realize they were here.  Ten minutes later, a server/manager? approached us and apologized for having given our pizza away and they made another one and they told us it was on them.  That was very classy, because I really didn't know it that pizza I saw go by was mine and they could have just said the kitchen was backed up.  Thank you again, Federal Pizza for being so aware and caring about your performance.  This was a Saturday early evening and there were people from every age range.  We also had the chopped salad which was delicious and for dessert my hubby had been raving about the berry cobbler.  I can't wait to come back.  I have so many items I want to try."}
{"text":"Yup. Federal Pizza is a great restaurant with a nice atmosphere.   I've heard about Federal Pizza for a while and finally had the opportunity to stop in for dinner. I heard they get pretty busy, but when I called to make a reservation they told me that it wasn't necessary. When my friend and I got there, we were greeted by two gals at the front counter and were told to wait for a few minutes before they could seat us.   We opted for a patio seat since it was so nice out that evening. The outdoor seating is my favorite because you get a good street view, but it isn't too loud. The ambiance of Federal Pizza is also very cozy and it feels upscale. We had two people serving us that evening and both were attentive and honest about what they recommended we try from the drink menu.   Our food and drinks were both great. The pizza was definitely fresh and unique, but also not too filling like a lot of pizzas. I am a big guy and it was enough for me and a second person. The drinks are also nice -they do some wine coolers that are refreshing. I did just go with a beer that our server recommended that would go well with the pizza we ordered. And it did.   We did order an appetizer as well, which was good but probably was the least exciting part of the night. In terms of desert, we ended up getting the doughnuts that they make, along with a chocolate dip. I know right?! Doughnuts for desert. That's a win in my book for sure. Overall, the food was nice, albeit it wasn't the cheapest meal I've ever had.   The only drawback I can see to Federal Pizza is the fact that parking can be difficult to attain in the evening, forcing you to park on a side street or across the street. Other than that, I found the atmosphere, food, and staff all excellent. I would definitely come back at some point, just to try another combination of ingredients on a pizza.   ...And the doughnuts. I would come back for the doughnuts."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night for date night after having amazing service and an overall great experience a few weeks back at Postinos and Joyride! My boyfriend and I are pizza fanatics and are always looking for a wood fired pie. The pizza is amazing (we tried the Casanova and the meatball. Both uniquely delicious) however, our service at the bar wasn't all that great. Overall, we will absolutely be back! Decent craft beer selection and even better pizza! Probably just going to sit at a table next time unless we see a new face at the bar!"}
{"text":"I visited Federal Pizza on a trip out West to see family.  When my brother suggested going to a pizza place I was thinking, no way!  I eat at some of the best pizza places in the world on the regular out on the East Coast.  Federal Pizza more than met my high expectations.    The Pizza was perfectly cooked and wood fired.  The toppings were inspired.  I was very impressed with their appetizers and salads as well.  It was so great that I went back again before leaving.  The Burrata with fresh baked bread was a great start.  The cheese is mild and spreadable and the bread is toasted to perfection.  We also cooled off with happy hour house made wine coolers.  They had a great beer selection as well.    I tried the meatball, manifesto, big star, and casanova pizzas.  The casanova and meatball were perfect for sharing because of their more intense flavors.  The big star and manifesto were more traditional, but with an artisanal kick.    Another great bonus with this place is that they source some of their products locally.  The sausage is made right down the street at Schreiners Sausages.    The staff is definitely hipster cool, but really helpful and excited about the food and drinks.  They made some excellent suggestions and made sure we had everything we needed.   The location is the perfect fit.  It's in an old bank building from the 50's and helps make this place have mid-century charm.  The decorations are also clearly somewhat Mad Men inspired.  But, the whole place feels so modern and clean at the same time... it's no time capsule.  You really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"How have I not written a review for Federal Pizza?! Federal Pizza is definitely in my top pizza places of all time. I love this place. Everything from their pizza,  pasta, appetizers and drinks are utterly delicious. I first tried Federal Pizza when I moved to central Phoenix a couple of years ago. I wanted to try this place out so I ordered a few boxes for my sister's surprise party. EVERYONE at the party could not stop raving about their food.  I always order Casinova. This is a sweet pizza and is my absolute favorite. The prosciutto, arugula and ricotta taste so perfect together. You must order Casanova, you will not regret it!  You can never go wrong with the Big Star (For ya'll meat lovers), and one of their newer ones Pineapple Express.   My boyfriend loves the chicken parm. The house breaded chicken is perfectly cooked and pairs well with the salad. I've had the Mickey White before and I enjoyed it. I usually don't like heavy pastas, but it was pretty good. I always order crisp fingerlings on the side and have tried to replicate it at home but have not been successful!  They allow you to order two different types of pizza in one, and also have some great deals on Mondays and Tuesdays. It gets pretty packed on those days since it is $20 for one pizza and a bottle of wine! You can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Some might call me a super-fan, but when Upward Projects does something, you can't help but love it. In the game of artisan pizza, Federal kneads out the competition.   Having tried most pizzas from their menu, I've landed on the Manifesto as my normal order. I love the Manifesto, with exception of the mushrooms, so when I order it, I always sub for brussels sprouts instead, sometimes I'm feeling a little frisky and have them throw sweet potato on there too. Not only are they happy to make these changes for me, but the server usually says something like \"That sounds delicious, I need to try it!\"  The manifesto, with goat cheese, red sauce, fennel, schriener's sausage, and brussels sprouts is delish. The toppings are always super fresh, the crust is a bit crispier than most other artisan pizza's from around town and the service is always excellent.  $12 - $15 will buy you a pizza sized well enough for one hungry dude or in my case, large enough for two to share. Joining their email posse will usually score you a free pizza once or twice a year for things like your birthday or promotions they feel like running.  Their vegetable side is neither here nor there in my opinion, likely because I don't love carrots, but the broccolini were delish.   If you're a dessert fan (remember two deSSerts and one deSert, in case you can never remember how to spell dessert or desert for that matter) they generally always have a fruit cobbler of some sort. If it's mixed berry, you must order it, dessert fans everywhere insist. Oddly enough, I don't order dessert at many places, mostly because I'm generally looking out for my figure, but in this case, I wouldn't be eating pizza either, but when I am, I sometimes order dessert. Go all out right? ;-)  Enough rambling and back to the part we're all waiting for... the end of this review.  Always delish, always fresh, and no one has ever actually gotten fresh with me while dining here, not yet at least.   Happy Yelping Phoenix!"}
{"text":"After constantly hearing amazing things about this place, my wife and I had to give it a try.   We went in on a Wednesday night around 7pm and waited just about 10 minutes. The host was extremely friendly (Kylie, I think?) and even gave us free dessert (the sugar dusted donuts which were freaking crazy good). We each got our own pizzas and they did not disappoint. I went for the meatball and she got the casanova-both were so different but complimented each other nicely.   This place has a fun ambiance, great service, and delicious food. Definitely our new go to pizza joint!"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff and AWESOME beer! keep up the good work! We will always stop here on our way to Sedona! the polenta was amazing an"}
{"text":"I live around the corner from LGO/Postino Arcadia and am a regular and fan of both. Windsor is great as well. Federal is a disappointment and tragedy. I'm not sure whether all these positive reviews are paid for by Federal or sponsored, or just by clueless foodies because they are outright lies. For a restaurant group that makes amazing pizza's at LGO, I'm shocked as too how disappointing and what a big letdown the pizzas are here. They are all overly oily and soggy in the middle. I've tried four different pies on two separate occasions and everyone in my party felt the same way and it didn't sound like anyone was going to go back for a while until the soggy dough and oily topping issues were fixed. When I was there on 11/08/2012 a co-worker had a stellar meatball sandwich, soft airy fresh baked pizza dough as the bread, fresh melted mozzarella, great meatballs and sauce, simple, traditional and delicious. Went back on 11/11/2012 to have the meatball sandwich that looked so good a few days earlier, talk about being letdown. For some reason the sandwich had been reinvented, it now had barely any meatballs on it and they had been supplemented with a ridiculous amount of caramelized like onions and the bread which was amazing on the previous occasion was hard as a rock. What in the world, massive amounts of onions on a meatball hero with barely any meatballs to be found, confusing. The pizza was no better, still soggy in the middle and disappointing. All restaurants have kinks to work out when they first open, but for a successful restaurant group that's hit homeruns with pizza before, there should be no kinks to work out with the pizza, nor should the simplest thing in the world, a meatball hero go from amazing to gross in three days. Another issue we experienced both times there is the service. Plenty of staff onsite, the problem is finding someone to help you or them coming back to check on you. Both times we sat around with empty drinks for a half-hour and had to hunt down someone to get a refill or the check. Plus this staff is very different than the staff at their other establishments, seems like a bunch of self-entitled hipsters that are too important are running the show. I'll stick to LGO for pizza from this crew; hopefully they don't experiment with that perfect formula."}
{"text":"Went there for a pizza fix and glad I did. Place was cozy and staff was great.  My husband and I both got a beer flight and both of our beers were warm which was so disappointing. Who likes warm beer??!  We started off with a chopped salad (which they separated in two bowls) and Arancini (fried risotto balls). Both were yummy and definitely would order the arancini again.  We couldn't decide on which kind of pizza to get and was split between 4. The waitress gave us the option of getting all 4 different styles in two 12 inch pizza. Score! We got the at last, casanova, manifesto, and Brussel sprouts pizza. Yes we were starving. They were all surprisingly good. My favorite was the Casanova because of the subtle sweetness to it from the dates. Of course we ended up taking it home because our eyes are always bigger than our stomachs.  We topped off dinner with a berry cobbler topped with Madagascar vanilla ice cream. Wasn't my favorite but my husband liked it.  I would definitely come here again for their pizza."}
{"text":"First of all my welcome was a well come...my server right away helped me with picking different selection of beers. That's a start. The meatball pizza is absolutely delectable. Actually it's the smiling cozy server that makes the food appetizing. Definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"First of all YOU CAN GET GOURMET PIZZA, BEER AND WINE IN THE DRIVE THRU!!!  That alone gets them some stars in my book!!!   The staff have always been good.. Even when I was with a group of NINE eight year-old boys, our waitress had the patience of a saint.  The people eating there are usually pretty friendly - more than what you normally find randomly dining  - just lots of super chill folks there... My theory is that the place is so good, it puts guests in a good mood so everyone is happy and friendly.  Or maybe it just makes me feel so happy that I see it all that way, either way... a good experience all around.    My favorites here:  The \"At Last\", \"The Answer\" and \"Sweet Potato\" Pizzas - all very unique and unlike your average pizza joint.  AMAZING!  Oh, and I hate brussel sprouts but the way they make them, they are actually good to me - so I am no longer a \"brussel sprouts hater\""}
{"text":"$5 pitchers all day til 5.  Count. Me. In!!!!  They have outstandinf beer on tap. I love the collete beer! I try everything once, I ordered a pitcher of a local brewery I hadn't heard of and the buyers were actually there. With that being said they bought my pitcher and I didn't know until afterwards. The patio is great for people watching, Postinos and Joy ride are around the corner if you want to hop around.  Food. You literally cannot go wrong with anything off the lunch menu or any sort of pizza. Their sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"Omg!!! I love their pizza!!! I actually don't eat pizza because I love rice! I can eat like 6 bowls at the same time but I never have been able to eat more than two pieces(sad I know). But guess what? I ate 3 pieces tonight because it is really good!! Ohhh yeah I'm in heaven now. Okay okay and the service was very friendly as well!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great food, service, atmosphere,and drink choices.  Parking can be improved and can the prices lowered.  Many options to pick from to include a variety of appetizers.  A definite 4 star pick and on my list for frequent return visits."}
{"text":"There's just something about this whole part of town I enjoy.  I haven't had any food in the area that I haven't liked yet.  I was invited here by some friends and was blown away by the choices.  The crust was perfect, the service was quick and their beer selection, while small, was great.  I look forward to many more visits in the future."}
{"text":"So I was bouncing back and fourth between Federal Pizza and Lou Malnati's - Come to find out Federal Pizza has this awesome deal, which includes a bottle of wine and pizza... I mean, how can you beat that?! We decided on a bottle of still rose, which was recommend to us by our server Nicole. I was damn near starving, so we ordered the meatball trio and OMG so freakin' yummy. There were so many tasty looking options, so I just told our server to pick a salad and a pizza for us. She did not disappoint!!! She brought out the chop salad (a salad with soppressata?! YUM!) and the Casanova (sweet AND savory). We left with full tummies and the service was just so on point! Big thanks to Nicole for rolling the dice for us. This deal is on Mondays and Tuesdays, but our experience was so great, we will go any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere....great specials on Monday and Tuesday's.  The service and food were on point all the way around.  Will def repeat when back in the area."}
{"text":"One of my all-time favorite pizza places! If you're looking for craft beers, excellent wine selections and creatively inspired pizzas then Federal is perfect for you. If you're looking for the standard pepperoni pizza and a Bud Light... well... maybe not the place for you.  Their roasted Brussel Sprouts and Smashed Potatoes are excellent appetizers - I could eat them all day long. As a vegetarian my favorite pizza is the At Last!  Layers of goat cheese, broccolini, corn, fresno chilies, mozzarella, lemon zest and a garlic olive oil sauce make this a party in your mouth. (Like I said, creative and inspired pizza!)  Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Delicious olives and the wine and Casanova pizza was absolutely delicious! Happy service, wonderful night."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar on a busy Monday night and ordered the balsamic vinegar roasted Carrots and Broccolini.  Good not wow!  Nicely roasted but rather simple which is nice too.  Didn't get much of the balsamic but still enjoyable.  Then the Meatball Pizza. Please keep in mind that I have been incredibly spoiled when it comes to pizza being from NY and having traveled throughout Italy.  Overall, very good and a premium product. Sauce could have a bit more Pop however the understated tomato sauce let the very delicious meatball and caramelized onion flavor sing!  Crust/dough, also very well done but not the best I have had either.    Overall, very enjoyable and great service from Josh at the bar!  Well done guys.   Your Truly,   The Official Pizza Snob : )"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends for an after school lunch and we had mediocre to low customer service. When we were paying, the waiter came and told us to go home and talk to our parents about proper tipping and reservation etiquette.... we are 18. We had made reservations a day before and tipped 20 percent which was very generous considering the lack of service we received. He came back and gave us money that was supposed to be for the tip and told us that we were rude and kids like us need to learn how to tip. We very kindly and calmly told him the money he gave us back was for the tip. He told us that \"if that is the case then I eat my words\" but never actually apologized for the incident. He then proceeded to walk away and not thank us nor apologize to us on our way out. He had no right to talk to us like that nor tell us that \"he would like us to go home and talk to our parents about it\"."}
{"text":"Discovered this one on Yelp! This place is awesome; it's my goto place now to satisfy a pizza craving. This place would be perfect for a happy hour -- there are so many pizza and beer options, it was actually hard to land on something. After my friends and I got our pizzas though, I realized I would have enjoyed any of the options. You really can't go wrong. The atmosphere is dim and intimate, yet it still feels friendly enough to invite your coworkers. The décor is trendy and a lot of seating options inside and outside. I expect to come back here a lot, especially after discovering it has a drive-thru!"}
{"text":"The food was good.  The service was better.  I ordered the Big Star pizza, sans mushrooms and olives.  When it came out, there were no mushrooms (allergy) but there were olives (preference).    The manager came over and rather unexpectedly comped our dinner.  That was totally unnecessary!  I'd have just picked the olives off, and would have paid for the pizza.    What it shows is that this company places excellence above all else.  I'm in.  I'll be back.  Oh, and I left the server a great tip.  The entire staff deserved it."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious and I love love love the wine coolers. The atmosphere is trendy but relaxing."}
{"text":"Never knew great pizza until I tried this place. Simply tasty, especially the local sausage. Yes, they messed up the order so we waited a bit for our food, but they were honest about the mistake and gave us a bill credit. Anxious to return!"}
{"text":"Another great restaurant by Upward Projects!  This location is in a great neighborhood situated off central in a remodeled bank of architectural significance to Phoenix. The Federal is a great urban, trendy pizza restaurant that serves unique, gourmet pizza that your chef creates with customized fresh ingredients unlike any other in town save Pizzeria Bianco. Even the crust is tasty and cannot be left on your plate. There are so many choices and the atmosphere us young and hip. I do love the background music but it could be played a bit lower to allow conversation. I will go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin...We went for dinner and got a Caesar salad with a Margherita pizza. The Caesar salad wasn't dressed well, whatever, it was just a filler for the pizza we were waiting for. Here's the thing, what we ordered was definitely NOT a Margherita pizza. Sure I have high expectations for pizza coming from NYC but this was far from Margherita; no red sauce, cheese and tomatoes for toppings? The crust was VERY doughy and not at all well done. Nope nope nope. Good service though but definitely wont be back."}
{"text":"Never disappointed. (I'd say that about all of the Upward Project restaurants though.)  I've been to FP a few times now and have to say, its always been a pleasant experience, good wait staff, chill vibe, not to loud and not rushed.    Today I had the salad chop, it was good, I can't figure out the dressing but I have no complaints, I'll let them keep their secret.  We had the brussel sprouts with pancetta, a little bit heavy on the lemon but we still ate the entire thing.  The beets with pears was strange, good, but strange, not sure I would order it again.  The wine list is good, I'm particularly fond of the Sivas-Sonoma Cab.   I'll be back, no question there."}
{"text":"Wandered in after a miss at Joyride and we were happy we did.   The beer selection was great, the service was solid, and the pizza was pretty good too.   Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Federal Pizza is located in Midtown Phoenix in a busy/congested area. It can be difficult to park, but there is a special lot directly east of the restaurant. The service was great, our server was attentive and the food was solid. The pizza was very good but not the best I've had, that's not to knock it but I've spent a lot of time in Chicago and New York, prime pizza capitals. The wings were awesome though and this spot is definitely worth a try. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"The food, cocktails and ambiance are fantastic! I love the open kitchen concept. The large parking lot is a plus."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on a Friday evening.  Not too long of a wait, so that was nice.  I had a pepperoni pizza and he had the Pineapple Express.  Both were quite good.  The service good as well, the waiter was attentive and kept our drinks full.  The atmosphere was good and interesting to see how you turn a bank into a restaurant!  The only reason I decided to go with 4 stars was due to the parking.  Unfortunately, my husband is picky about who drives his car, so he won't do valet.  The parking may not affect everybody.  We would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times and it is consistently excellent. I love their pizza and they have very interesting drinks. The only thing that can be disturbing for some is that it is very loud."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place more than I did.  Self parking is a bit tough.  Ended up having to park across the street, cross the major road in front of the gas station and then walk down the block and around the building.  The ambiance is nice.  The service was fabulous and friendly.  We decided to try a half and half pizza.  We went with half patata bianco and half sweet potato.  Both were pretty bland.  We also tried the loaded brussel sprouts and they were amazing looking and just okay tasting.  I did love that they have butter for me to put on my crust.  Big star added for that."}
{"text":"Great new addition to the Central/Camelback corridor!  The group behind Postino, Windsor and Churn have certainly done it again!  The atmosphere is great...very busy and good vibe.  The service was friendly, efficient and made great recommendations.  The food was very tasty too...definitely try the meatballs and grilled veggies as an app and the big star and brussel sprout pizzas were a hit too.  Be prepared to wait 30+ minutes for a table...at least on a Friday night, but it is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here several times now and we love this spot. The food is delicious and fresh and never disappoints with every new dish we try. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to try a spin on classic Italian food!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go here for at least year, but almost always wound up at Joy Ride or Postino. Now I grieve that year that was without Federal! I was having a bad day and did not feel like cooking at all or interacting with any more people, and remembered this place has a drive-thru. It took me awhile to figure out what to try, but the girl taking my order on the phone was super patience and helpful. My order was ready when I arrived 15 minutes later and the smells that filled my car were purely intoxicating. When I got home and finally was able to try the handmade ravioli I was starving, but the flavor was so amazing and unique that I had to eat slowly and savor it. Truly one of the absolute best pasta dishes I have had in my life. Italian food in PHX tends to be below subpar, but this, this is a stand alone. I was so blown away I saved a few for my husband for when he got home later. It was still incredible warmed back up. I also had the Great Little Salad, which lived up to its name nicely. Can't wait to go eat in soon!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. I feel like this pizza was so special, every bite had so much flavor and the crust was not left on my plate. Of course I like add an egg to my mostly vegetarian pizza,  and also you can get pitchers of beer for supercheap. The parking is pretty stupid, but that won't stop me from coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, fun bar & delicious food. I go almost every week with friends and everyone always has a fantastic time."}
{"text":"Great selection off beers. Awesome food. Wish they'd build one in the east valley! Hint hint"}
{"text":"Really great food and beer. Any place with hoegarden is fine by me but the grilled veggie starter was delightful."}
{"text":"My friend/coworker took me here for lunch today cause she really likes it and knew I had never been. The staff was friendly and attentive. We both had ice tea and it was very refreshing. The orange slice in the ice tea gave it a little extra something. Then we started with the Mister Mister appetizer which was a combination of baby zucchini, artichokes, sweet potatoes, and mozzarella cheese tempura'd served with two different sauces. For our main meal we shared the Federal Chop salad and the Casanova pizza which had dates,ricotta cheese, prosciutto, arugula, and pecorino. Everything was amazing and I would definitely go back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"This place is really good!  The location is perfect and the atmosphere is really urban with a hipster feel to it.  We went during the week and it was semi-busy but we sat at the Pizza bar in front of the kitchen.  The guys in the kitchen were really nice and super talkative which was an added addition.  We ordered the Meatball pizza and the Cesar salad to share.  The salads are a big portion so you can share or have as an entree by itself.  The pizzas are also big enough to share.  The dough had a really good crisp texture and the toppings (cheese, sauce and meatballs) were really fresh and flavorful.  I cannot wait to come back and try some other items on the menu.  I have to agree that the waiters were not overly friendly, they were not rude but didn't go the extra mile to be friendly.  The guys in the kitchen rock though!"}
{"text":"Had a fun time at Federal Pizza the other night. For the most part the food was great, I loved the arancini and my friend thought her pasta was excellent. I ordered the cioppino and thought it was okay. My main complaint was that it was seafood in a tomato sauce, as opposed to a stew with broth. Not quite what I'm used to, but it tasted fine. The atmosphere is great and the staff is wonderful. Next time I think I'll go with the pizza which looked delicious."}
{"text":"Such a fun spot! Good beer selection and delicious pizza :) we got the meatball pizza and it was so good! A little on the pricey side, but the atmosphere makes up for it!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've had in Phoenix. I don't say that lightly, I've eaten at pizzeria bianco, cibo, spinatos, pizza a metro, and the like. At Federal they use fresh ingredients and it was tasty. Hipsters have infiltrated this establishment though. So if you have a fear of hipsters this isn't the spot for you. The house-made wine coolers are nice as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely great from start to finish appetizers were great as well as the pizza and hand made wine coolers definitely a place to come back to."}
{"text":"Federal Pizza does not disappoint! We live down the street and walk to dine-in at least twice a month. There pizzas and salad are delicious! Their pizza crust isn't too thick and we love their unique topping options. The federal chop salad and the classic caesar salad are our go to options.  We have a toddler so we tend to go around lunch on the weekends or the occasional evening and we have never had a long wait. The staff is friendly but it can be slightly slow at times, but not slow enough that deters us from going back time and time again. Another splendid restaurant from the Upward Projects team."}
{"text":"I love the crispy polenta sticks, could and would eat them everyday. The pizza is really good too. Goat cheese and broccoli on a pizza...yum! This is not your typical pizza joint."}
{"text":"Another Upward Project gem (Postino, Windsor)... This time they take on pizza! And as usual, they know how to tantalize the taste buds. My husband and I sat right up at the counter overlooking the kitchen & wood-fire oven. It was busy & lively. I had a mushroom & green pepper pizza which was good, but I think I will go for one of their pizza creations next time. They look interesting & possibly delicious. I was really impressed with their \"Great Little Salad\" for $4... It wasn't your usual iceberg, carrot & ranch dressing side salad. It truly was a great & a cheap addition to my pizza! I cannot wait to order a pizza for pick up & pick it up via their drive-thru. How cool huh? Every parent's dream!!! ;-)"}
{"text":"group of 12 of us had a great time and great meal.  ordered lots of appetizers that went around the table - tasty assortment!  several craft beer fans in the group were very pleased.  one person ordered a wine cooler which came in an interesting bottle and it was very good."}
{"text":"Just really good pizza and great beer!!! Chicken parm is perfect, don't care that it might cost a lot it's amazing. Pineapple express was great and had a nice kick to it. Will be back at least once a week"}
{"text":"A little slow on the service (~10min to get our drinks) , but once the six giggling co-eds left, our server had plenty of attention to give.   The pizza was great, brick oven style. Great selection of house styles, baked fast. Would probably try them again when in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I thought this might be between a four or three but felt  it earned a four. Service was just a little spotty but you can tell they care and want to run a top notch eatery and that comes through.   Our day started here for lunch before a visit to the museum. We shared the meatballs for an app and the fried polenta was near life changing. I would go back just for that.   For entrees we had salads, me the chicken panzanella and wife had the chopped. Both solid. I appreciate when a place like this, known for pizza in this case, also has good salad and healthier options.   I would go back next time I'm in central, but I would eat at their sister lgo in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Super fresh, high quality food. This would also make a great happy hour location and can we talk about the awesome lunch specials? For $10.50 you get half a pizza and a salad of your choice and they always have creative choices in pizza. Today I had the patata bianca which is a white pizza with fingerling potatoes, ricotta, prosciutto, and rosemary oil.   First bite:  This is weird.  Second bite:  This is weird and really good. Third bite:  Is there crack in this? Fourth bite:  I love this f#cking pizza!!!!  I like this place, so much YUM!  Also, they have a drive-thru window.  Smart idea, Federal Pizza."}
{"text":"I've always been obsessed with this place because of the pizza. The meatball pizza especially is unbelievable. Their crust is great - wood fired. And the marinara sauce is amazing. Plus their pricing is reasonable.  Not until our last experience did I realize how above and beyond this place is.  My husband and I placed a carry-out order.  We drove up, got our food, and left. As soon as we got home, I noticed I had a missed call. It was Federal - they had forgotten to give us part of our order, and we hadn't even noticed.  They asked if it would be possible to come back by. We came back, got our food, a big apology, and a voucher for a free meal for our next visit.   Best pizza place in Phoenix for sure."}
{"text":"Love it ,from Boston' and went with 7 of us and ate like kings and queens,bartenders,manager,servers,1st class,decor great,food a 10 , this is gonna be are 3rd time back,outdoor seating,love it !!!"}
{"text":"I asked my girlfriend is she wanted pizza. We searched by reviews as well as a new place to try and found Federal. Tucked in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood, it was daunting at first to see a full parking lot. As we walked up we noticed a Drive Thru of a sort which makes to go orders fast and easy.  FIRST THINGS FIRST: If you want a hole in the wall, mom and pop, Italian kitchen greasy pizza, this isn't your spot for today's meal.  HOWEVER:  If you want something filling, light, gourmet, and unique to your taste buds, I highly recommend Federal Pizza.  Pros: Everything tastes as if it's made in house. Flavor crossovers I didn't think would work on pizza, but absolutely do. The cooks can be seen making your food. There are handmade wine coolers for the day drinkers. The plating is lovely and the portions are good. The atmosphere is very hip. *Emily is a great server.* There are yummy vegetarian options.  Cons: aside from the alcoholic beverages in which I do not partake, there are limited drink options to the fountain standards. There aren't jalapeños or blue cheese which are a must when I snag a pizza (but on that note, this is the kind of place where every meal or pizza is specific for a reason, and that works in a place like this.)  We got the lunch which is just under $10 per person for a half pizza and your choice of salad or soup. Girlfriend got the soup which was a cauliflower fennel combination (weird but satisfying and vegetarian.) I picked a salad with citrusy stuff in it. The pizza she chose was a cheese pizza (she fears change sometimes) and I snagged one with goat cheese, lemon zest, OMG other goodies.  4.5/10 give it a shot for new and hot."}
{"text":"I am not really a huge fan of fancy pizza, but this pizza was quite delicious. I went for the classic pepperoni and cheese and it was really good. It's a pretty big personal serving of pizza; most likely you will need to take half home. It is on the pricy side, but you can tell the ingredients are fresh and high quality. This restaurant is really cute and right next to a bakery, which is convenient for the sweet tooth after. It was good and I will be back, just not on a regular basis."}
{"text":"AMAZING food here! Chefs special with squash, bacon, arugula, balsamic reduction, and lemon ricotta is to die for. If that pizza isn't available the sweet potato and Brussel sprout pizza are equally as good. Always satisfied!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza place with lots of tasty extras.  Excellent happy hour price for pitchers of good beer ($5).  For pork belly lovers, try the porchetta sandwich.  The beets w/pear side dish is fantastic.  Awesome brussel sprouts with pancetta.  Regarding their pizzas, we almost always get the Casanova, the sweet potato/sage/ricotta and The Answer.  We visit here every 2-3 weeks and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"The service was good, and the atmosphere was ok but the pizza was kinda eh. I'm not a fancy ingredient kind of guy so it didn't appeal to me but if that's your thing you'll love it. Kind of a hipster joint lol so the beer list was good."}
{"text":"Wow! So delicious! I actually had a dream about it after eating there last night so it was like reliving the amazing pizza all over again. I will never eat at another pizza place."}
{"text":"Love this place! Cool little hipster spot! Great pizza, great service! Me and my gf love this place."}
{"text":"First time, and I'll be back! The beet salad and roasted veggies were wonderful. Really good desserts too. Service was excellent, unlike Windsor, there is plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Since going to Federal Pizza for the first time last Thursday (as in July 25th) I have now been there three times in the last week.  3!!  I am addicted to the watermelon and mint wine coolers (only $5 at lunch).  I have had the meatball pizza, margarita pizza and caprese sandwich.  ALL DELISH!!  Obviously I'll be back...tomorrow perhaps :)"}
{"text":"I have so much love for the Upwards family, and Federal has been a favorite for ages!  Our favorite is to come by on a Monday or Tuesday and split the Big Star, well done, with a pitcher of beer. The pizza is consistently perfect and we love the rotating seasonals. The Brussels are an awesome side!   Today - PLOT TWIST! - we got two lunch specials and shared a pitcher. Half a pizza and a salad for $10.50, no brainer!  I was surprised that the pizzas were literally single pizzas, half of the normal size. I kind of chuckled to myself, imaging MJ shaping little football sized pieces of dough for this purpose. Ha! Delicious anyway."}
{"text":"WARNING! The gluten-free crust looks and tastes like pre-made frozen crust. It was flat, flaccid, deflated, and perforated--just like boxed gf pizza. The toppings were skimped on.   The rest of the pizzas looked delicious. Places can and do make delicious gf pizza that tastes like actual human food. Federal can't do that. If you want a gluten-free pizza that doesn't taste, well, just bad, go to Cibo.  The delicious-looking pizzas in all of those photos are not gluten-free."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken parmigian,  chicken Ceasar salad and Margarita pizza.  Chicken parm was burned to a crisp,  completely unedible,  Ceasar salad was drenched in lemon juice, completely unedible  (chicken for salad was good,  came in seperate container) and the pizza,  the whole thing had about a 3 dimes (size wise) of cheese.  We called the restaurant and they said \"take up your concerns with uber eats\".   ZERO customer service or care.  Don't bother with this restaurant, everything from the food to customer service was unbelievably terrible.   Mistakes happen, but the level of not caring about our experience was off the charts unexceptable."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for our first experience last Sunday afternoon.  AMAZING!! My husband mentioned it may be the best pizza he's ever had.  We had the Patricia Jane salad and a Casanova Pizza.  They were both very good with a lot of fresh flavor.  The flavor combination of the Casanova was the perfect combination of sweet and salty and the crust was perfectly soft crust but crispy edges and not to chewy.  I would highly recommend FP if your looking for a great pizza.  And they have a drive up window, how cool is that!  If only I lived closer."}
{"text":"Place always delivers.  Solid beer, solid pizza, solid meatball sub, etc.  They don't have gluten free pizza, but they will in July."}
{"text":"I must need to try this place again. Either that, or I just don't get it. The atmosphere is pretty chill, really low lit at night. I liked that. Our server was really nice and attentive. The food wasn't bad at all. We got the Margherita pizza and I just didn't really think it was that great. The wine coolers weren't as amazing as everyone made them out to be either. It felt like I was drinking wine watered down with juice and ice. They do come in cool bottles though. This place is totally good, but I just wasn't blown away by it."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix forget Bianco. This is the spot. Get a veg board app and thank me later"}
{"text":"My favorites are the Brussel Sprout pizza and a growler of Chubs. Couldn't be any better."}
{"text":"11/13/16 I'm from the East Coast.....so.....my search for pizza like home has been on the 4 months that I've been here. I've tried Barros and NYPD...both disappointing. This pizza right here definitely hit the spot. I HATE doughy pizza and this pizza was the total opposite of that....SCORE!!!! I ordered the lunch special half pizza half salad. Caesar salad and pepperoni pizza. The dressing was on the peppery side, but not too much where it killed my taste buds...very flavorful. The pizza was tasty and thin just how I like it. Cant wait to try some of the unique combinations that they have on their menu.  When I called to place my order, they were friendly and professional. That drive thru is tricky...I was looking for a window, but it's a door! The person who took my payment and brought my food out  was friendly as well."}
{"text":"Great service! Great Food! Fabulous ambiance! Fabulous attentive staff; Not pretentious at all. These UPWARD PROJECTS Group are smart, innovative and awesome. Wish them much success. Can't wait to try their new venture, Joy Ride Taco right next door."}
{"text":"So I have been to Federal a couple of times before for their drinks with friends and was always happy with what I got. Their wine coolers are delicious and since they have been open for a while now I think they may have gotten stronger (liquor wise). HOORAY because for me 8 bucks for that drink is a lot. But I feel it is well worth it now. :)  Now for the food, yummmmy! The Burrata is amazing, then we had a chop salad and the margherita pizza with prosciutto. It was all so yummy. This was shared between me, my husband and a friend and we all left very satisfied.   Here is my ONLY STIPULATION. The pizza's are so small for the price. I understand a lot of places are going this \"we use top quality ingredients for our toppings\" however, they did not put enough prosciutto to make me believe it was worth the overall 15 dollar 12\" pizza size. Just my opinion.  Otherwise, atmosphere nice, people friendly and staff pretty friendly too. Just be prepared for the crazy parking!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that I finally got to try Federal Pizza!  I had heard so many good things about it over the years and can finally be one of those persons that spreads the good news.    Our server was wonderful.  He gave us some really good recommendations, like the pizza.  He recommended the Brussel Sprout Pizza.  OMG.  It was perfection!  I love anything brussel sprouts, but was still was a little skeptical about it.  Now, I would recommend it to anyone.  If you like brussel sprouts and pancetta, this is the pizza for you! You can't beat the $5 dollar pitchers of beer for happy hour.  They do offer happy hours on the weekends on pitchers of beer, coolers and glasses of wine.    I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I have written one good and one bad review about this place.  This time it is neutral.  While the food is awesome, the service theory works best when the place is mostly empty and fails when the place is busy.  The have one point person but everyone is suppose to work for your table which causes people to be over served or under served.  I love the concept but it needs to be determined is it the servers or the practice.  Maybe it would be better to split the floor on busy nights having 4 people for half the place and 4 for the other half.  As always the food is awesome.  Oh yeah, as you can see in the pictures, they are very unprofessional and do not make the pizza look as good as it tastes.  I saw a guy in there taking new pictures with no imagination so I take it those pics are going to be even just as or more disappointing.  Do not let them distract you.  The food is fresh and their take on things is awesome."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place, as I'm crazy for Postino's. It was alright.  The pizza was just alright in my book.  I enjoyed the wine coolers more than the pizza."}
{"text":"Highly recommend, wonderful food, adequate wine selection and atmosphere that wasn't too loud for conversation but still was rockin'  Ms. D and I were busy running errands in the area and didn't have time to cook so she suggested we turn to Yelp and have dinner out.  A quick look in the area and we decided to try Federal Pizza (noticed Federal was near our favorite Postino).  We arrived in casual clothes and although it was a 30 min wait we were seated quickly.  I was starving and we got on our orders of The TLC Salad and a Big Star pizza.  For a first visit we nailed it; the salads was fresh, crisp and flavorful while the pizza was amazingly wonderful crust with fresh ingredients.  The sauce was the only ambiguous part of the meal as it didn't really come through; not that this is a bad thing just that the fresh toppings and the wonderful crust was so overwhelmingly good.  Ms. D enjoyed her Home made cooler and I thought the Primitivo wine wasn't especially great.  But did I mention the crust on the pizza was tasty (LOL).  Parking is a bit weird and while they have complimentary Valet which only allows one way entrance I did not really want to check my car that evening."}
{"text":"Love this spot. Great food, service, and atmosphere. My favorite pizzas are the Manifesto and the Casanova. They have a drive thru for to go orders and serve growlers. I've sat at the pizza bar area a couple times and enjoyed watching the pizzas being made. Overall, I'd highly recommend."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza in town.   We stopped by after a day at the pool at a buddy's place and we had a great time. The beer selection was outstanding, the staff was super friendly, and the pizza was superb.   We also indulged in the bombolini, which was a perfect way to end a meal.   We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Federal Pizza is truly awesome.  I am a fan of the marguerita pizza, I like to keep it simple when it comes to pizza.  The tomatoes are so fresh, it really blew me away.  Everyone at the table loved their food.  I've been in three times and each time Federal Pizza blows me away.  The staff is supper friendly.  One more recommendation, the doughnuts are fresh, soft and fluffy.  Not to be missed."}
{"text":"LOVED IT!  It was a perfect dinner!  I went with a group of 5 and we each picked a different entree and a few appetizers to share, we also got a few pitchers of beer and my friend and her date got the wine coolers.  Everything was delicious, fresh ingredients, the service was amazing.  John, was the server who showed us to our table.  What a gentleman, very courteous and knowledgeable!  Ask for him when being seated, you won't be disappointed.  I have a habit of drinking 6-8 glasses of water during dinner and my cup was refilled promptly and I never went thirsty.  The pizza was AMAZING!  The feel of the restaurant is very cool, the lighting is great, I would even go there on a date.  I can't wait to go back!  I am not sure which of the pizzas was my favorite since I tried 3 different ones and they were all amazing."}
{"text":"I can't tell if it was high expectations from all the hype that caused my disappointment or the food in general.   After hear a lot about how good this place was I decided it would make a good spot for date night. Came in at 6 on a Sunday and were sat immediately.   Having previously stalked the menu I asked about the Mister Mister appetizer. Was given a vague description describing it basically as a veggie plate with some dipping sauce. What came was actually pretty good but it was cheese sprinkled crispy veggies (I think lightly fried) with 2 dipping sauces it was pretty good.  As for the pizza we got the Casanova and Manifesto. The casanova was fine but I felt like the dates had over powered the prosciutto (which seemed to be lacking some flavor) and the combo wasn't anything special as I feel like every place has a bruschetta just like this. The manifesto was also okay but I felt like the sausage was very bland and plain and the goat cheese didn't mesh well with the other flavors. The mushrooms were the star of that pizza by far.  On both pizza's i felt like the crust was good but soggy in center. I think overall it was somewhere between thing crust and regular which is a no mans land for pizza crusts. The flavor was good but not amazing.  Dessert may have been the most disappointing thing. We got the Lil' tripple which if you have ever had jello chocolate pudding with an oreo and some cool whip you have already experiences. I was expecting some more unique flavor from this but really oreo pudding snack packs have the same taste.  Maybe my expectations were too high for this place but I walked away feeling like for the money there are other places I would rather go and it isn't even in the league with Bianco. For me it also isn't somewhere I would being making the trip to go to again except for maybe a happy hour if other people where there. There is nothing wrong with the pizza but I think the place is overhyped."}
{"text":"Four stars for the pizza. Three stars for everything else.   Walking in, I couldnt help feeling that this place was a chain (like a national chain). I dont have much to say about this other than I never felt completely comfortable. Our waitress was decent at being cordial, but she didnt seem very attentive during our meal. I had to flag her down twice for water and the check. I like that they have craft beer on tap, but their selection was not my favorite. I ordered the half pizza half salad, since they dont do by the slice. The pizza was actually pretty damn good. I like the combination of toppings they offer, as well as the additional items you can add. Granted the good stuff to add makes the pizza way more expensive but thats just the way it goes. The bread was soft yet firm, and the veggies were fresh. The salad unfortunately was drenched in dressing and lacked much flavor. If i were you, I would skip the salad all together.   Come here for pizza. Other than that, I would be careful of what to expect. It might be enjoyable or it might be just OK. I wouldnt mind trying thir other pizzas though."}
{"text":"Super good! We went during happy hour- we both got drinks/split a $16 pizza/got the fingerling potatoes/ kid's pizza and it was $40. Service was fast and super personable! Also they make their ranch and it's THE BOMB, weird but trust me get some just to try it."}
{"text":"Awesome.  I know it is strange to say but this pizza joint had the best cauliflower I have ever had.  Great service and excellent food"}
{"text":"Damn good pizza and unlike joy ride next door, darn good service. I have absolutely loved it every time I have been here and i keep coming back for more. The bar tenders are friendly and know their stuff and make excellent pairing recommendations.   The pizza is absolutely wonderful and I cannot say there is one I do not like. If I did not feel like one topping or the other they are always happy to accommodate and swap it out for something else. My only complain is that this is the place that makes you want to bury your diet kind of pizza so be warned you will wind up eating way more than you thought."}
{"text":"The meatball pizza here will change your life. I've enjoyed every pizza I've had here, and there are so many unique styles to choose from. They also have a great beer selection and offer growlers. If you order pick up, there's a convenient drive through.   On top of the delicious food, the staff is always cheerful, friendly, and efficient. Food is delivered in a reasonable amount of time, my water glass was never empty, the hostess smiles and welcomes guests with a genuine smile, and the waitress was upbeat and helpful."}
{"text":"Cool pizzas, all kinds of different blends. Shared a couple of pizzas with my friend and both were really good. Had the meatball pizza and \"the answer\", can recommend them both."}
{"text":"Schooled in Napoli but not beholden to its rigid regulations. Sourced locally and allowed to be as creative as our current tastes. In short another great addition to a city already steeped in world class pizza.  The place has a non pretentious  community feel and it gets added points for having a parking lot that hasn't been commandeered by Valet profiteers."}
{"text":"love, love, love. get there early for a table outside (before it's hot). pizza's are great, and we usually do pepperoni + peppers + basil and it's delish."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today for lunch. The food was amazing and the service was outstanding! We shared a pizza which was a perfect size and also ordered the wine coolers. The wine coolers were GREAT! I had the raspberry and lavender wine cooler and am now trying to figure out how I can make them at home! I am looking forward to making this one of my new regular spots. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"5 stars to Federal. By far my favorite pizza jaunt in Arizona.  They are legit. From recommendations about drinks to the pizzas and small bites.  Had a meaty pizza by suggestion from the bar staff and it was perfect. The crust crispy the meat was a higher quality and you could taste it.  Had a few beers and great conversation with the team that took care of us.  I've been here many times and every time it's a blast and we are able to grub happily. Keep it up."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar as we only went for a beer and dessert. We had the triple berry cobbler which was good. The pizza looked good, but we were full already."}
{"text":"It's adorable, it's tasty and they have great deals!  Love this place!  FOOD: The pizza crust is lovely!  Ask for some olive oil on the side if you're into dipping.  After several visits with a vegan friend,  I can personally assure you that the At Last and the Sweet Potato taste great vegan-ized.  They pile the veggies on more generously to make up for the missing cheese, which is really nice.  The At Last tastes wonderful with the cheese, as well!    Last night we also tried the tender, tasty Pumpkin Ravioli (without the pancetta, which might make it even better).  It had a lovely, creamy flavor and delicious chunks of  weird veggies (like turnips and rutabaga) on top.  It wasn't too big to finish all by myself.  ATMOSPHERE: The decor is 50s and a little swanky, but the atmosphere is perfectly casual.  There's a TV over the bar so you can catch the D-Backs score, plus cozy booths and a real candle on the table for romance.  The service is top notch - genuinely nice people from hostess to server to the nice lady who kept filling my water.    DEAL: Monday and Tuesday nights, you can get a bottle of wine (or two pitchers of beer) and a pizza for $20.  They'll even cork the wine so you can take it home if you don't polish it off.  I think the pizzas are supposed to be 12 inches but seem bigger to me.  Looking forward to our next meet-up there!"}
{"text":"YUM!  Things I love about Federal Pizza: Casanova pizza, Wedge salad, using the drive thru to pick up a pizza AND a bottle of wine (that is 1/2 price when bought at drive-thru), Tuesdays pizza and bottle for $20.  Things I don't love: I can't eat pizza every day."}
{"text":"Always great service and terrific food...definitely my favorite Upward Concept! Fun and relaxing atmosphere, very friendly down to earth employees too."}
{"text":"Yep, I love it!  In fact, I have found my new favorite cocktail, the Grapefruit Ginger wine cooler.  I do not care that I am not supposed to have grapefruit juice.  It is so worth it.  I started with 5 stars for this drink.  As for the pizza.  I apparently like roasted brussels sprouts, at least when paired with pancetta, manchego, and garlic.  The Manifesto was not to be outdone, though. Schreiner's sausage, mushrooms, goat cheese...a big ole slice of good.  My husband, the pizza purist, gave high marks to the pepperoni, too!  And these are good-sized pizzas.  Three pies for three people was ridiculous, but we all wanted something different.  My arm did not have to be twisted to take the leftovers.  I only wished we had tried the polenta sticks.  Next time."}
{"text":"Federal Pizza is a wonderful, cool and hip place. Service is excellent and welcoming and the food super yummy and flavorful. I highly enjoyed the ambiance of this place and the Staff.  My friends and I had a fantastic time and it was my first experience here.  Take advantage of their Monday and Tuesday night specials that include: pizza and either your choice of a bottle of wine or 2 pitchers of beer for ONLY $20!  I heard they also own the Joyride and other neighboring restaurants, I MUST check it out since this place was a hit!   We had a very opposite experience earlier today at Cibo and this place definitely made up for it!  Thank you Federal Pizza and friends that made this evening GREAT. We'll be back!!!! :)"}
{"text":"I have yet to find anything here I don't realllly enjoy.  Last night the bf and I shared the campari tomato appetizer before chowing on pizza.  This is sort of their caprese salad... They roast a few campari tomatoes and serve them up with fresh mozzarella, a healthy portion of aged balsamic, drizzle of olive oil and a few basil leaves.  That cheese is seriously melt-in-your-mouth delicious. And the buttery-ness of the cheese goes jut perfectly with the acidity in the tomatoes and balsamic.  A sprinkle of fresh-cracked pepper and sea salt is the cherry on top.  If you're an olive fan, it should go without saying to try Castelvetrano olives as well.  As for pizzas, I absolutely love the Casanova.  The Answer is really good as is the Manifesto.  I even enjoy the Brussels Sprout pizza.  I'm leaning toward the Sweet Potato pizza next time with sausage added to make it a bit more savory. As with most restaurants, I have yet to make it to the dessert menu... If you are in the mood for adult beverages, their house made wine coolers are light and refreshing.  They have a good craft beer and nice wine list too.  On Monday and Tuesdays after 8pm, you can get a pizza and 2 sm pitchers OR a bottle of wine for only $20.  If you don't want to drink and then drive, you can get this same deal through their carry out window.  Winning!!"}
{"text":"Arrived on a Saturday night around 8pm and the restaurant was full with a 30 minute wait.  Not sure what I was expecting, but was surprised, as moving to uptown Phoenix recently, I have found most restaurants close early and restaurants seem to clear out by 9pm.  Federal Pizza is an exception as it stays open as late as midnight on Friday & Saturday nights.    The evening started out perfectly, as once we checked in, we were offered drinks while we waited.  Time always seems to go by quicker with a cocktail in hand.  After about a  20 minute wait, we were seated.  The restaurant is beautiful, clean and smelled great.  We ordered a combination pizza and a couple appetizers.  The pizza had wonderful flavors but the only flaw was a less than crispy crust, that I blame on all of the toppings.  Next time we might try something without so many toppings.    As parking is tight in this neighborhood, you must use the valet or expect a bit of a walk.  As I have mentioned in previous reviews, I am not a big fan of valet and even worse, the valet guy called me \"Boss\" which for some reason rubs me the wrong way.  Message to valet guys, I prefer to be called \"Sir\" or 'Your Majesty\""}
{"text":"Great ambiance with mediocre pizza. Neither my friend nor I were particularly impressed with the food."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Windsor or Postino and love pizza, just go to Federal Pizza already. The spot is owned by Craig DeMarco's Upward Projects, too, and it has the same hip vibe all the other restaurants do -- with good food, as always, too.  The interior actually reminds me a little of Chelsea's Kitchen, with warm lighting and a homey feel. There's a bare bones patio facing the street, and the servers tend to be young and have their own style because of the lack of uniforms. The joint is casual -- I even went right after teaching a workout class, and no one seemed to care about my grungy attire.  The drink menu is simple, with beers and flavored wine coolers. I got a lavendar raspberry one, which was delivered in an oh-so-cute little jar-like glass. The cooler was refreshing and tasted like flavored Sprite -- I'd recommend trying one.  I started my meal with an appetizer -- foolishly, considering just about everyone at my table got individual pizzas, which are way too huge and should be shared! I got vegan black bean soup of the day ($3), which was decent but a little bland -- I loved the crunchy texture of the soup from the veggies, though.  For my pizza, I got a simple cheese pizza with olives ($12), which I could only eat two out of six slices of. The pizza was really crispy, almost burnt on the edges, and it just wasn't my favorite type of pizza -- I much prefer the floppier style of Cibo.  Still, it's nice to have another central Phoenix pizza option, and it's right across the street from the to-die-for Churn -- which alone makes the trip to Federal Pizza worth it."}
{"text":"Is this good pizza? Is this great pizza? Could it possibly be superb pizza? Nope, this is quite honestly the melt-in-your-mouth, gobble up every bite, ditch the diet type of pizza and I'm completely sold!   I came here for the first time on a blustery, windy and rainy day. After jumping through raindrops, I stepped foot inside and was immediately welcomed by a scent of pizza dough baking in the oven while warm air welcomed my cold toes. They seated me in a cozy table that allowed a visual of both the restaurant and the kitchen, so I was able to see the action come alive!   After looking at the menu, my lunch guest and I decided to share the Big Star pizza and the Chicken Panzanella. Both were spectacular! The Big Star pizza had a perfectly baked crust that was the ideal blend of chewy and crunchy. Layers of cheese, olives, peppers, pepperoni and sausage topped the pizza crust. It's the kind of pizza that makes you sneak a second and third piece on your plate. It's the kind of pizza that makes you forget about the wedding dress you have to fit into in two months. It's just that good! The salad was also delicious but obviously didn't compare to the pizza. However, it did fill me up so that I stopped myself from consuming yet another piece of the pizza! The chicken on the salad is grilled which gives it a smoky flavor and the vegetables add a nice flavor. All I can say is that the Postinos/Windsor family have done it yet again! They are really making the Camelback and Central corridor a foodie's delight!   One other item I'd like to note: Are you a beer drinker? Not only do they have a detailed selection of craft beer, but they also sell growlers that you can take home with you. If you pick up food to-go, you can fill a growler for half price. Not a bad deal if you ask me!"}
{"text":"Great vibe and decor the pizza was great so was the pumpkin ravioli.  The wine and beer selection was more than adequate. The service was great very attentive and friendly. I would highly recommend a visit you will be glad you did"}
{"text":"Took a co-worker for lunch here and it never disappoints! We sat up at the bar and we both ordered the lunch special (any 1/2 pizza and 1/2 salad of your choice). I decided to keep it pretty basic this trip and just get the pepperoni pizza and caesar salad. My co-worker got the caesar salad and the margarita pizza. She really enjoyed it as much as I did too. The bartender was great too! Her customer service was top notch!!  I will certainly be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"It's been a super long time coming but I did want to update my review. After I submitted my first review the company reached out to me maybe 3 days or so after I posted the review and offered me a gift card to come back and try again.   So I did, and this time instead of sitting outside I sat at the bar so it would hopefully be a completely new experience. I didn't have to wait as long for food or anything this time however the bartender seemed uninterested in us at all. I am not a very demanding person, nor was my company however it's nice when you are checked up on and that your drinks are full. Maybe it's just me, but the person I was with commented on it before I did.  I like the location, and overall I really want to like this place. Maybe I've just gotten some bad luck but it still has deterred me from going back."}
{"text":"I went here on Veteran's day and sat on the patio to watch the parade. The service was good, but a little slow since we were on our lunch hour and needed to get back to the office. The pizza was so yummy! I went with two friends, and we each got different pizzas to try them out, and swapped leftovers to take home a variety. Yes, it was good even when I heated it up later.   I'll go again at dinner time and post a follow-up review once I try drinks and maybe a salad."}
{"text":"Drive thru pizza, beer and wine to go? ?,you've got me! !! Refurbished bank, now a cool pizza place.  The bartenders are super nice,  they have a good beer and wine selection.  They also have a $20 dollar deal for pizza and bottle of wine on Monday and Tuesdays.  Try the margerita pizza with pepperoni, is not in the menu but they will make it!"}
{"text":"Great Tap selection priced right beer outside seating."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to go to Federal Pizza forever and finally was able to get a sitter on a weeknight and took advantage of the pizza and bottle of wine for $20. Got the Casanova and it was great! Although my husband loves dates (and ricotta and prosciutto) he was a little worried but it was amazing! A sweeter pizza, but the creaminess of the ricotta, the saltiness of the prosciutto and the freshness of the arugula were great balance. We ordered the Brussels sprouts w/ pancetta on the side (mostly because it was a toss-up for the Brussels sprouts pizza) and they also helped balance the sweetness of the pizza. Can't wait for the next weekday date night :) so we can try all the pizzas."}
{"text":"Took my family here while they were visiting from Michigan. To quote, \"I think this is the best margherita pizza I've ever had.\" and \"Why can't we have cool places like this at home?\"  Service was great, food was awesome. The homemade wine coolers are the bomb dot com. We ordered the grilled veggie board, fingerling potatoes and three different pizzas - all was exceptional. Pretty good sunset view too!"}
{"text":"Hoeegarden on tap and Ayinger bottles! Awesome! Some of the best pizza Ive ever had, completely different from anything else there is.  Owned by the same people who run Postinos and Windsor, so this trendy little place gets packed."}
{"text":"Underwhelming.    After reading reviews I was super excited to try this place, but it was just okay- mediocre if anything.   I tried the manifesto and it was pretty bland. The sausage was good but there was only a couple pieces on the whole pie, same for the mushrooms.   Normally I make my own pizza from scratch and grill it, but I had a craving and didn't feel like cooking. Maybe I just caught them on an off night, but I can't really recommend the place.   The atmosphere and service was great - I walked inside to get my takeout pizza.    Not awful by any means, but not worth all the hype and $14."}
{"text":"Don't stop here.   I had the grilled artichoke and it was not cooked all the way thru.   The Caesar salad was mostly wilted lettuce and I had to ask for more dressing.   I am sorry I wasted my time and ate here."}
{"text":"Federal Pizza. The place is located right and feels very well built.The material- and color composition makes sense to me. Great center booths. I like the menu and the pricing is very reasonable.  Despite the fact that the participated evening was the \"soft opening\" night I think the team handled issues with grace. I will be a fan and a frequent guest! Keep it \"up\" ;)"}
{"text":"Loved this place until the Bartender not only had major attitude - She filled up her personal water bottle at the bar and stuck the soda gun all over the rim of her water bottle - yuck !"}
{"text":"This place is dynamo for lunch or dinner and is really as good as it gets.  This restaurant group is amazeballs to begin with (Postino Wine Cafe, Windsor, Churn and a taco joint in the works) and Federal Pizza is another bright star shining in their sky.  The prices are reasonable for this wave of artisan pizza that we are all drowning in, but in my mind so, so worth every penny.  Perfectly thin and crispy crust with delicately distributed toppings and gooey, melty cheese battle for control of your tastebuds in a war where everyone wins. We've tried the sweet potato pizza and brussel sprout pizza and both were unique and taste-tastic.   The service is always top notch and I definitely recommend the fried polenta as an appetizer. Get over the hipster crowd and maybe-too-loud music and enjoy the damn good food."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time a few days ago, and it was delicious! We split a pitcher of beer and a Meatball Pizza that was so good. It was pretty messy pizza and the cheese and stuff kept sliding off, but it was still super tasty :)   If you sign up for the email rewards you can actually get a coupon for a free pizza, which is what we did and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! The entire pizza menu is so unique- love me boujee pizza options. The whole pizza menu is paired with beers / ciders too! Love that.  Gluten free pizza is an option for an additional $3. Very fair.  Federal pizza, joyride tacos & postino are all part of the same company - so if you like any of those you'll probably love here too!  Super amazing staff too.  Great experience & food here"}
{"text":"In the past when I have been here (on a Saturday night coincidentally) the service was excellent. Tonight, the service was terrible. We had to wait for a long while before ordering, before our food came and after we finished and were waiting for the check. No one ever checked on us during the meal or asked if we wanted another glass of wine. Not sure if I will go back or recommend it again. I can get bad service and pay less at Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"Tried Federal Pizza for the first time tonight. Atmosphere is nice, though the restaurant is so dark, its very hard to read the menu. Service was good and food was brought out in a reasonable amount of time. We ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza. While my wife enjoyed it, I found it to be way too salty. The pepperoni and the pizza sauce were both too salty for my taste. My wife enjoyed one of their signature 'wine coolers' and the prices on everything was just okay. Overall, they have the location, the atmosphere and the employees - now all they need to do is put the same amount of effort in the food.   Incidentally, when the waiter asked if we wanted Parmesan cheese with the pizza, we expected him to come back with a shaker. Instead he has a cheese grater and cheese and starts grating it over the whole pizza. (My wife wanted parmeson, not me). So that was an unexpected and unnecessary surprise. Best to leave the Parmesan with the customer in case they want more later and can put on as much as they want. This makes more sense with a pasta dish..."}
{"text":"The pizza wasn't as good as expected,  very thin crust not to my liking. Might come back to try something different on the menu"}
{"text":"The wine coolers! Oh, YUM. If Federal Pizza let you order the wine coolers via take-out, I would be in big trouble.   Don't really like overly dark restaurants, so I've opted to order out, which can be tricky. Their pizza combinations and flavors are good, but the crust doesn't always hold up for take-out. It should be a bit crispier to accommodate for pizzas with heavier toppings like meats and sauces but since you won't have trouble holding back, just make sure to pick it up right when they tell you to so it won't sit overly long. If you're dining in, the crust probably isn't that big of an issue.  I recommend the The Answer (with sausage, apples, fennel, candied... pecans, I think, gorgonzola, and spinach) and Sweet Potato (sweet potato - duh - ricotta and sage). Also check out the Chef's Whim. Have never tried it personally, but I heard the Casanova is also really good!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great atmosphere food and house specialty drinks.  The pizzas are fantastic here.  My favorite is the Big 5 with sausage pepperoni bell peppers onion and roasted corn.  Please make sure to ask for a side of marinara for the pizza crust which you'll totally going to love..."}
{"text":"We were excited, but the vibe and service was not what we were looking for.  We decided to skip on ordering food - great HH drinks tho - could be a better draft selection."}
{"text":"Pizza has definitely improved. We eat here fairly frequently and always bring out of towners.  My parents come from the midwest every winter and stay with us for 1-2 months, and it is a MUST have for my dad...he absolutely loves (and claims to dream about!) their iced tea.  So imagine his excitement, when after telling our waitress how much he loves it, that she pulls him up a growler of the stuff AND sends home a package of the loose leaf so he can brew his own back home.  He literally hugged the waitress and the manager, he was so happy.  THAT, is customer service.  The Manifesto pizza, the sweet potato pizza, and especially the Answer pizza...to die for. And ALWAYS order the meatball appetizer, even if it is just to eat the fried polenta!  Thank you, FP, for making my dad's experience unforgettable."}
{"text":"The BF and I decided to FINALLY venture over to Federal Pizza for a yummy Friday evening.  I've been waiting to try this place for a while, as I LOVE all the Upward Projects restaurants, and have heard rave reviews about their wine coolers and pizza.  We arrived around 8:30pm and the place was hopping for a Friday night, mid-summer... Always a good sign. The hostess greeted us with a warm smile and informed us that we could wait about 20 minutes or we were welcome to sit immediately at their pizza bar or the main bar. Both were full service so we opted to sit at the main bar, and forego the wait.  As we bellied up, Josh, our friendly bartender sporting a bright colored Hawaiian shirt, was quick to say hello and get us started with some waters while we looked over the menu. After a few moments of sipping on a blueberry hibiscus wine cooler and a draft hef, we quizzed Josh on his favorites and decided to start off with his recommendation of Arancini, delectable Fried Risotto balls, with Herb-Stuffed Parmesan & Mozzarella, finished off with Pomodoro Sauce, a sprinkling of Grana Padano. Normally I'm not a huge risotto fan, but boy oh boy, this was a crisp and flavorful delight.   Next, we decided to order the Meatball pizza sans onions, sub mushrooms. The perfect 12' pizza arrived in a prompt time of 15 minutes, with gooey, bubbling mozzarella and the plethora of toppings. I was particularly excited to read on the menu that the handmade dough they used came from MJ Coe, and if you are familiar with that name, you know it's going to be good, and I was right. Normally I'm a crust tosser, but not this time!   We decided to skip on dessert, however I really want to go back and try out their bombolini, described as \"warm donuts with chocolate dip\"... Umm, yes please!   We finished off with another round of drinks, however I switched from the blueberry hibiscus wine cooler and tried the strawberry rhubarb... Which is now my new favorite drink. It's house made, bubbly and refreshing, even the BF liked it.   Did I mention they have a drive thru as well? Don't feel like dining in? Call it in and pick it up! Definitely coming back to Federal when I'm craving some good pizza and cocktails!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch there today. Pizza crust was chewy, veggies on top of the pizza had great flavor. We ordered a salad with dressing on the side but they brought it out with the dressing mixed in. They quickly made a new one for us and didn't charge us for the salad. Most places wouldn't do this. Class act."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! We ate the Brussel sprouts, side salad and the Casanova pizza  the loaded brussels were a little salty but other than that everything was great. Looking forward to next time!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Pizza is top notch. I had the Big Star...wonderful combo of toppings, with the Great Little Salad. Can't wait to go here again!!! And the beer on tap...home run!"}
{"text":"Federal Pizza is giving my beloved Parlor pizza a run for its money.  The pizza's are great (I've had the LoneStar, the date and proscuitto as well as the brussel sprouts).  The borrata appetizer is great and they've finally caught on that we need more than two slices of MJ's bread.  The ambience as you can expect is fun and whimsy, this is from the LGO guys after all.....for a casual wine and bruschetta night I'd still go to Parlor.  (Parlor also has better dessert and cocktail selections) but for lunch, or a quick bite I think I'd lean towards Federal if not for the beer selection."}
{"text":"I love that they allow dogs at this restaurant.  The staff are way friendly the food was great. You can't go wrong with any pasta and pizza on the menu.  Today we had the Manifesto Pizza, At Last Pizza, Federal Chop salad and the Lamb Pasta. I totally recommend all of them."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Olivia Newton John - Physical)  I'm singing all the things that I know you'll like Making good Yelp reviews I gotta order you just right You know what I mean  I took you to a pizzeria  Then added suggested toppings There's nothing left to talk about Unless it's next to Postinos Unless it's horizontally  Let's get Federal, Federal (pizza) I want to get Federal (pizza) Let's get into Federal (pizza) Let me hear your palettes sing, you palettes sing Let me hear your palettes sing    Federal Pizza is in the heart of Phoenix's food mecca; close by to Joyride, Postinos, Lou Malnati's, and Hula's Modern Tiki just to name a few.  I came on a Monday night with a group of friends.  Every Monday and Tuesday after 8pm is pitcher of beer and pizza for ONLY $20....what a deal!  Too bad we came at 6pm haha!  Needless to say, they have a decent selection of local brews.  I ordered a crispy dark lager that night along with some appetizers to start; brussel sprouts and arancini.  The brussel sprouts came well charred and topped with pork belly bacon and sliced almonds.  It was doused with a lemon aioli and came with dipping sauce; it was alright.  My favorite bite of the night had to be the arancini; a fried and breaded risotto ball stuffed with parmesan and mozzarella cheese on a bed of marinara sauce and basil!  The crispy breading with the subtle warm bite of the risotto and cheese melted in your mouth.  I'd be done with this but hey we at Federal \"Pizza\", so have to try out the pizza.    For our pizza we ordered the Pineapple Express.  Topped with prosciutto, pineapples, calabrian, chili and chives; this was a flavorful pizza.  The prosciutto was salty while the pineapples gave it a sweet bite.  I thought it was alright still thinking of the risotto balls haha!  In the end, Federal Pizza definitely has a great deal on a Monday and Tuesday night.  I thought their pizza was doable, but nothing too special.  Coming back for the arancini for sure! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. The menu is short but the options are all very interesting and quite good.  Great service too."}
{"text":"I will put the time to fully explain why this place is way too cool for it's own good. But for now, just understand that it's amazing.  If you don't believe, check it out for yourself, go on a monday or tuesday and get their 2 pitcher / 1 pizza combo for $20 and the mouth dropping experience will begin."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of great things about Federal Pizza and it kind of lived up to the hype.  Our group ordered three different pies: Casanova, Brussel Sprouts, and Margherita.   Both the Casanova and the Brussel Sprouts pizzas were fantastic and unlike any other pizza we'd ever tasted. The Margherita was good as well, but was a taste we all knew very well.  I also love the modern/classy/artistic feel of the restaurant itself. The prices are reasonable and the staff were friendly enough.  It was an overall good experience and we'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"A friend and I came in with 5 children between us and two of them busy toddlers.  We felt seemingly out of place in this hipster locale.  But we had the best service!  Our pizzas were perfection, our salads amazing and our server was top notch.  We cannot wait to return again and again!"}
{"text":"Federal Pizza is my favorite Upward Project. Cool and casual, with bike parking and comfortable Central Ave patio seating, the food and drinks are always excellent and the service is great.   I highly recommend the Casanova with dates and ricotta cheese. Coupled with their wonderful crust -- it takes like heaven.   Just be aware that it gets busy, especially on the evenings with their pizza+drinks specials."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but when you serve HAIR with the pizza, it's hard to like. My fiancé and I decided to finally try Federal Pizza a few months ago. We arrived on a Sunday night and it was very busy. We were promptly seated and started with the Mister Mister, which was over breaded and over cooked artichokes, baby zucchini, and sweet potatoes. The batter was so heavy and very underwhelming in flavor. The presentation was done well, but the execution was poor. We then shared the Chicken Panzanella salad. The salad was fresh, the only thing we didn't enjoy about the salad were the stale croutons. Now, here is where things go completely downhill. We order the Manifesto pizza and the 4 Kings Cheese pizza. I watched the manager on duty, checking the pizzas before they were brought to our table. At one point I witnessed her actually touch our pizza with her bare hands. Being a cook in Maricopa county, it is against health code violation to touch ready to eat food with bare hands. Well, our pizzas, which were raw in the middle, and passed the manager's quality control, were delivered to our table. We immediately pointed this out to our server and they took the pizzas to be cooked more. The cheese pizza arrived both times with a very large and unattractive grease puddle. I know pizza is greasy, but if you are using the high quality ingredients, you state you use, why is there literally a grease puddle. The Manifesto, arrived after being cooked more, my fiancé was trying to enjoy his slice, about that time the manager came to our table. As I am taking a bite, and she is asking us if everything is better now, there is a HAIR on my slice of Manifesto. I look at her and say, It would be better if I didn't have a hair on my slice of pizza. Her response was to LAUGH and tell me I'm jinxed. Really? At this point, we were both so turned off. We just wanted to leave and never return. My fiancé argued he didn't want anything free, that he wanted to pay and never would we come back again. She insisted on taking care of everything and gave us two coupons for pizza. We wouldn't go back even if it was free. Needless to say, I gave the coupons to a co-worker."}
{"text":"Yummy is all I can say and the wine beverages are to die for!  Great happy hour and wonderful service too!  Don't miss this place or you will loose out on some really good food."}
{"text":"My new favorite. I'm a regular.  Veg board, wine coolers, and Old Chub all day everyday."}
{"text":"Stopped by Federal Pizza for work function and had the chance to try a couple of their salads and pies. I liked the vibe and staff, but food carries the weight in my reviews and I overall think the grub was just okay.  Here is my thoughts:  Federal chop salad-was the better of the two salads I had. I recall it had pepperoni, pepperoncini, provolone, and a vinaigrette among other things. It was good and had the flavor of a antipasto salad but just lacked substance in my opinion.  Harvest salad-It had squash, pumpkin seeds, blue cheese, etc. but just lacked the strong flavor I was expecting. Okay, but not great.  Sweet Potato Pizza-Again I was expecting strong flavor but it was just okay. I assumed it would be on the sweet side which I was hoping for but felt it was bland.   Sweet Corn Pizza-It was better than the sweet potato and had stronger flavor. Would never think of ordering this type of pie but it was pretty good.  Meatball Pizza-The big winner amongst all the food I tried. The meatball was very flavorful and the cheese was on point. The sauce was bold with this pie and really what I was looking for. Five star worthy.  Overall, would I stop by again? Maybe. I just was not blown away with this gourmet pizza establishment and would prefer a few other joints instead."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that I am a BIG Upward Projects fan, so I might be a little biased. Windsor and Postino are two of my favorite restaurants, so I was extremely excited to try their new venture - Federal Pizza.  Our waiter was fantastic, recommending selections from each section of the menu. Because it was a work lunch, we didn't sample one of their wine coolers that consist of a house made infusion and sparkling wine, but I WILL be back for happy hour one day to try them out.  The atmosphere is really great - the windows fill the whole place with light and mid-century modern decor is abound. One of the small details I loved is that each table has a different style of salt & pepper shakers, so it was fun to look around and see the fun varieties. Being an Upward Project, the restaurant features cozy & comfy seating as well as a fantastic bar set-up and patio.  For starters we got the corn coins (marinated/cheese covered corn cobs sliced into coins) and they were delicious. Sweet & salty. We also got the baratta and bread and it was also tasty. If I had to chose one, I would get the corn coins since they are not something you see on other menus in town.  We decided to skip salad this trip and split two pizzas - the Casanova (featuring dates, prosciutto and arugula) and the Manifesto (featuring Shriner's sausage, mushrooms, onions and cheese). Both were incredible, and how could they not be on the doughy yet crunchy Michael Coe crust. It's my favorite crust in town now, so look out Parlor!   I already am excited about my next trip there. If you love Windsor and Postino, run, don't walk, to Federal Pizza. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"The pizza was good. Although it was super thin and I feel like even a personal pan pizza won't fill me up. I like the meat one and the taste was good. There's other options too! Somehow, I feel like Bianco would still be my pick for this type of pizzas. I just like the way Bianco makes it in their brick oven, but this place is good too. I could come here every so often for variety."}
{"text":"Unique and delicious pizzas.  This is our go to place for Pizza.  We love the Casanova pizza.  It leaves you satisfied and feeling good about what you just ate.  We also enjoy the TLC salad.  The golden beats in it are awesome.  The staff is always very friendly.  The owner must treat there employees well because the staff always seems happy!!  The sweet potato pizza is also really good and our two year old loves the spaghetti on the kids menu."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with friends last week and there were some definite ups and downs.   We arrived around 7:20 on a Thursday evening and the place was packed. The owners own several restaurants in the area. They bought a lot across the street and made it into a parking lot but it was packed and there was limited street parking and they didn't have valet that night like they do on the weekends.   The place was a little too loud for my liking, but I'm sensitive to loud places.  My friend and I split a pepperoni pizza. It was good, but not so good that I would make an extra effort to go here over another  pizza joint. Other people in our group had pasta and they looked really good."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here a few weeks ago and it was amazing. The food was spectacular. The service was what really drove it home for us! She was incredibly knowledgeable, attentive and fun!"}
{"text":"The pepperoni pizza is good but the crust is the scene stealer here!  If it wasn't for the crust, I would have rated it a 3 for \"meh\" just for the pepperoni.   The next time, I will try one of their specialty pizzas to see if its more creative and flavorful.  Until next time..."}
{"text":"8/2/13 Ease of Parking . Busy but given a table right away. Staff pleasant. Olives good. 4 cheese pizza...not so great. Crust in middle kind of flabby. Sauce was so bland it had no real taste. Where was the cheese??? dough itself pretty good. pretty pricy for quality of food. wont go back.Also very noisy."}
{"text":"Sounded yummy: too bad they have us waiting 8 minutes on the phone and then the call just ended. A world of unfulfilled promises!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go.  Whether you sit at the bar, a table, or out on the patio, you can't get a more inviting atmosphere.  The staff are all fantastic from the personable bartenders to the \"hands on\" attentive managers.  Food is fantastic and they go out of their way to make sure you enjoy what you are eating or drinking.  If you don't have time to sit down you can always grab your meal (and a Growler) through their drive thru. My only complaint is they need to bring back the Answer Pizza!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend visiting Federal Pizza in Phoenix.  The food and service are consistently outstanding.  Gary, Manager, Brandi, Server, and the entire team at Federal Pizza always exceed my expectations.  I look forward to visiting Federal Pizza many times in the future."}
{"text":"Brussel sprouts and sweet potato on my pizza? OK, Enough is enough. The crust is so-so and while I really wanted to like this place, it didn't rock me. We had the meatball pizza and it was OK. I would love to see a real NY or Chicago pizza restaurant in this town. The Wedge salad was good but I do not like dates with my blue cheese dressing thank-you.   Service was good and my friends liked the beer, large and varied selection. On to another pizza place."}
{"text":"Good pizza and great beer selection! I didn't get a chance to actually try their beers because I ordered food for take-out, but I saw what they had on tap and they were all solid options. The pizza was pretty good, we had the manifesto which I liked and the meatball one which we both thought was delicious and the best out of the two. Also got a caesar salad which was $10 and was just lettuce, croutons, and caesar dressing. You can tell the dressing was made fresh, but aside from that it just seemed like a plain caesar you would get for free as a side. As for the service, I can't really say much about it, but it did seem like it was lacking a bit. They didn't bring me any utensils, even though I got a salad, and they didn't bring me a bag to carry all of my things in. It wasn't crowded at the time so I don't think there should be any excuse of forgetting those things unless they were just not used to handling take-out orders."}
{"text":"Meatball sandwich or the meatball and spaghetti are delicious. For pizza, the Big Star and Margherita are done in a nice stone fire oven. We had the burrata for a starter and it was excellent. Great spot for all ages, loud and lively with plenty of tv's to watch the game."}
{"text":"First things first....AMAZING SERVICE. Team style....and right on! Everyone was so friendly and informative. My drink was constantly refilled, and that's big for me.   Now...food....AMAZING!!! Best margarita pizza I have ever had. It tastes so fresh.   The donuts were so good.   Great deal on Monday and Tuesday. $20 for pizza and bottle of wine or two pitchers of draft. If you don't finish the wine...they cork it and send it home with you!   Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Upward Projects -- I'm obsessed!  I've been a forever fan of Postino, and Joyride is another family / friend favorite... the Windsor is a fun and tasty place and Churn... well just look at the line at any given time. -- what's not to like when you can get freshly churned ice cream?!  It may have taken me a long time to make my way to Federal Pizza, but it's now going to be added to the regular rotation of places we eat out... with friendly staff (shout-out to Richie), a decent sized menu with fresh ingredients / delicious food for any palate (even my picky kids), wine, beer, and so much more, Federal is fabulous!    I love the casual, hip environment and both indoor and outdoor seating options.  In addition, FP offers a drive thru so you don't have to get out of your car when you order ahead and swing by to pick up your food!  On a recent visit, my family of four had a Federal Chop Salad, an order of Polenta Sticks, a Big Star Pizza, a kids pepperoni pizza and a kids buttered noodles.  It was plenty of food, so we had leftovers the next night.  FP is moderately priced as well.  Insider tip:  check their website for specials -- there are some really good ones!  And join their eposse for some additional sweet deals and freebies on occasion.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The service is great. We came in a few minutes after the kitchen closed and they stayed open for us. A great way to treat some out of towners! If I'm ever in the Phoenix area again, I will definitely be coming back. Food is good."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the wine coolers, beet salad, and mozzarella cheese sandwich. Yummy!"}
{"text":"My mother and I hopped between a few different Upward Projects restaurants. Federal Pizza was our first stop.  We split an order of the brussel sprouts and the lunch meal deal.  The brussel sprouts were very flavorful and the garlic aioli that came with it added a good punch.  The Casanova pizza was great. I would say go for a full pie because there's a little bit too much crust to filling ratio but the flavors were great. I will definitely order a full pizza next time."}
{"text":"I like eating here. It's good hipster pizza, even if the toppings don't always stay on. Good for individuals, dates, or groups. You probably want to figure on about a pie a person if you're at all hungry. My only real quibble? The music is always too loud, which when it's busy, makes it almost impossible to have a conversation, if you're in to that kinda thing.  I'm personally a huge fan of the buratta and the Manifesto pizza. Dip your crust in their ranch if you're in to that thing. It has a bit of a lemon-dill taste to it that's surprising in a good way :) They also have a great special on Monday and Tuesday nights, and a happy little happy hour."}
{"text":"The Margarita pizza and berry cobbler are a staple if I am stopping by here. It is so good that I can't change my order (and I am notorious for getting something different every time)."}
{"text":"Pro Tip -- go for lunch and get the double down special! You can't beat a half pizza / half salad! Add $5 glasses of wine and you're set"}
{"text":"Note: We will no longer give any business to Federal.  This was a bad experience with the food. Sad, but its ruined all our pizza cravings for now. So, good luck w the place..but we will find a new spot the next time we want pizza."}
{"text":"To the owner: I just left your restaurant, & my total was half as much as it could've been because of your wait staff. I was never offered another wine cooler, even though mine was empty through the entire meal. (would've had 2 or 3). Was never offered desert, & I'm still waiting for bread that never came. The food I did have was good, but it was my first time at your restaurant, & I would've liked to try other things. This can't be good for business. I just wanted to let you know."}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab a bite here with my daughter. The ambience is nice and I really enjoyed the music selection they had playing. The food quality was good, but a bit expensive for what I received. Didn't get a chance to try the pizza, but will on a future cheat day. I'd re-visit, but wouldn't make it one of my regular spots to hit up."}
{"text":"I'm not a big pizza person and this place still gets 5 stars.  I actually even chose it for my bday luncheon with the family (not that their fantabulous bar had anything to do with that choice...) ;-)  Brussels sprouts pizza = heavenly.  Wine coolers = YUM!  I'm a strong drink kinda gal - gimme an Old Fashioned any day.  BUT, these coolers redefine what you think you know of as a wine cooler.  Its not that they're super strong or anything, but they are beyond refreshing on a hot day.  (Or a cool day for that  matter.)  I highly recommend the Grapefruit Ginger as long as you aren't a super sweet-tooth.  Atmosphere is great, people are friendly, food and drink are yummy.  Go now!"}
{"text":"Dude..... the crust.... it is so different, but very very yummy! It made my 1/2 casanova very enjoyable.  I would be drawn to that style of pizza on their crust more than the traditional saucy pepperoni stuff.  It seems more fitting to me.  My Hubby had the pepperoni and something just wast quite right.  It wasn't bad at all.  The salads and appetizer selection were like dream worthy! So unique! I will be back for those for sure! We sat at the bar, and the bartender was fine.  Not rude, no problem, but not nice, disengaged with people maybe.  Huh, I don't know... Maybe I am needy... Haha!"}
{"text":"Friday night around 8pm and this place was packed with crowds waiting out front. Valet was the only option- don't bother driving around to find a spot. I figured that was a good sign and considered us lucky to grab two seats at the bar. The staff is friendly and the music is FANTASTIC- old school Cyprus Hill, Beastie Boys had us in the right mood.  The menu looked good with so many options that it actually took a while to decide. But in the end, I can't say I was impressed.  - We started with the veg board. Best were the roasted carrots and potatoes. The cauliflower and fennel would have been better with a bit more time in the oven because they were still really al dente with not nearly enough of the golden brown I hoped for in a dish described \"wood roasted\" - Kindly- the server offered to make our pizza half and half. We chose the sweet potato/ricotta/sage and the brussel sprout/pancetta/manchengo/lemon. Both good in theory, but failed in execution. The slices of orange spud and creamy ricotta were both tasty, but toppings were limited to the very center of the pie, leaving at least half of each slice naked and flavorless. There were barely any brussel sprouts on the other side, though the lemon flavor was tasty and something I would try to repeat at home. The crust was a real issue- undercooked and doughy. Just poor execution of an otherwise good idea. - Side salad was fine and priced right.  Overall, happy to leave this place for others who enjoy it more. Though they win the prize on music selection, there are many better pizza options in town."}
{"text":"Who am I kidding with my original four star review??? We all knew I'd be bumping it up to five stars eventually.   Well, looks like that eventually has come sooner rather than later. I decided to go back today (yes, for the second time within their first week of business) and try out a few other menu items. I also wanted to check out their patio on such a lovely Sunday afternoon.   I am not disappointed to say that I thoroughly enjoyed myself once again. Our server was Jet (a staple at all Upward Projects restaurants) and he is always on top of his game. I'm glad to see he'll be hanging out at Federal Pizza...that means the staff will be as excellent as what you can find at all of their restaurants. I tried the caprese sandwich this time around and was pleasantly surprised. Pane Bianco may have a competitor here...the mozzarella was super fresh, the basil was fragrant, and the tomatoes were juicy and tangy. Not to mention the deliciously charred bread that was drizzled with olive oil. So tasty! The drinks were as lovely as before and the patio was perfection on a sunny fall day.   So hurry over my fellow Yelpers...I promise you'll enjoy every bite!"}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to come here for a girls day, we both love trying food so we tried the seasonal burrata and the polenta, both very good! The service was good, other than when we asked where the bathroom was from the host she acted like it was an annoying question. Anyways we order a half the answer pizza and half Casanova ugh to die for!  Such good flavors on a little slice of pizza. If it was closer to where I lived I'd go here again! It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"If I were reviewing Federal Pizza for the food only, I'd bring my review up to a 4 star.  That being said, we had a weird experience here last weekend.  We arrived around 6:30 after being told this was a good time to arrive (no reservations for parties under 8 people).  We had just under this amount and were told it would likely be short wait.  Well, after a 30+ minute drive, we were told we had a 2 hour wait.  After some smooth talking, it was shortened to 60 minutes and we agreed to stay.    Fast forward 90 minutes and we were still waiting for a table.  In general, it was a big deal, its to be expected in a pre-summer weekend.   The next issue was the service.  I found the front staff and servers to be a bit pretentious.  This is a big pet peeve of mine.  No one deserves to be talked down to.  Our waiter was nice in general, but was very inattentive.  Several parts of our order were messed up or not even brought to our tables.  When we asked about this, they acted annoyed.    The food was good - we ordered 2 veggie pizzas and 2 meat pizzas.  As a vegetarian, I only tried the veggie pizzas, but they were legit.  The appetizers & drinks were ok.  Again, things were forgotten so I can't give a whole review.  If you're close by & want pizza, perhaps give it a try.  If its the weekend, you're better of trying somewhere else.  The Phoenix area has so many great pizza places that I don't recommend wasting your time at a place that is more pretentious than it is delicious."}
{"text":"I heard nothing but good things from this local pizzeria and being that is was a Friday night having the drive thru experience when picking up a pie is ideal! Picked up a \"meatball\" pizza pie that was plenty of food to serve at least two. I was really impressed with the meatball slices on top of the pizza, combined with the house mozzarella, red sauce, basil and roasted onions. This combination hit all my taste buds!  To top it off all the pizza's are cooked in a brick oven,  adding the wood fired flavors! This place is worth a try if you are not in the mood of sitting in a restaurant or wanting to try out some new pizza with the drive- thru experience!"}
{"text":"I met up with some friends here for lunch on a Saturday.  This was my first trip to any of the Upward Projects facilities since the new parking lot across the street.  Made the overall visit much nicer.  I was able to park at Federal, brunch at 10 at Windsor, lunch at 11 at Federal Pizza and dessert at Churn at 12:30 with different groups without having to move my car or deal with valet.  I got to lunch at the tail end of the group as us stragglers came in the staff just kept rearranging tables. Service was great the whole time and the staff was fully prepared to answer questions and provide suggestions.  I had already decided on The Magnificent with a glass of 8th Street ale.  Both were very good.  So now I've been to everyplace but Postino and liked all of them.  I need to try the remaining one that was really the first of theirs in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Sooo good!  This is my kind of place. Everyone was super friendly and talkative. The waiter, the owner, the greeter... Super nice.  The food was awesome and the drinks were equally as good. The atmosphere was great, and the music was a good mixture. I will definitely go again. They have an awesome little kids menu and all three of my children enjoyed everything they ate."}
{"text":"Great pizza, I really love the sweeter sauce and sausage.  The Caesar salad was not the great.  Prices are just a little too high."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a late afternoon lunch with my girlfriend here. She had already been and raved about it so I trusted her choice. All options looked great but we were in the mood for some prosciutto so we opted for the Casanova. I was a little iffy on the dates but they ended up complimenting the arugula very well. Great afternoon meal out on their patio and great experience. We'll be going back again soon."}
{"text":"All I can say the PIZZA is AWESOME SAUCE!  :)  I got the meatball pizza.  YES!  Parking was not bad, service was good, no asking for refills, and we had a corner table so it was not loud and I can hear my fellow foodies..."}
{"text":"Wow after reading the reviews for this place, maybe my expectations were too high.  Very bland Ceaser salad, one size pizza, which could cause more than 2 people to over or under order, and finally placing paper under the pizza, on top of the pizza pan, collecting grease, and making it difficult to get a slice without a wad of paper, since they never cut the pie all the way through.  I wouldn't rush back, and definitely wouldn't wait to spend my money here."}
{"text":"Super cool spot great for dates. Food is delicious . Kitchen open until 11 and bar open til 12 midnight.  Wish our pizza just came out a little quicker but it was great and ingredients are super fresh."}
{"text":"This place is close to my apartment so I decided to order a salad one night when I was craving a quick, light meal. I got the harvest salad with chicken. It was mediocre - definitely nothing to write home about. It was on the small size, very overpriced for the amount of food. Doesn't tempt me to go back and try their pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza, wonderful beers, super service. What's not to like. Stopped in for a mid-afternoon lunch with wifey. Arrived before she did and scanned the menu for microbrews. Settled on a Green Flash IPA and ordered a pint. Server said, \"that's $5, but during pitchers are $5 during happy hour, so I'll bring you a pitcher\". SCORE.  Ordered a brussel sprouts, pancetta & manchego pizza to share. Amazing. Superb crust. Best touch was a touch of lemon juice on the pie, which provided just a hint of acid to cut the fat and saltiness of the cheese and pancetta. Server was really nice and fun. Tough to beat. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"A really cool atmosphere (the bathrooms feel like you're at a club).   Staff is nice. Drinks are affordable. I had the chicken Panzanella salad. Good portion, good flavor - a tad expensive for what you get, but overall not a bad experience.   Stay Cheerful ;)  P.S. Someone please explain to me how this place has a drive-thru #whyyoumakenosense"}
{"text":"Love this little area-the Windsor, Churn, etc., all great! Federal Pizza has great food. Pizzeria Bianco gets all the love but honestly, Federal Pizza was just as good, if not better. Less packed and less expensive. Great cocktails, too. Be sure to save room for ice cream at Churn across the street!"}
{"text":"I just love this place! The veggie board rocks and their pizza is awesome! Today I had the At Last (?) pizza with broccolini, corn, basil, chilis, goat cheese, and lemon zest. It's one of my favorites! Great lunch specials too!"}
{"text":"Best. Ravioli. Ever. We went there for my birthday celebration dinner. Our group of 6 got several things to share. Homemade ravioli, vegetable lasagna and two pizzas. Everything was very good, but that ravioli! I loved it! My mom and sister did too. The brown butter sauce and pine nuts on it were so delicious! The restaurant was very clean and nice. Great service and beer too! Definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"While searching yelp for a late night bite, I found Federal Pizza open 'till 11PM, so I went.  The host was a very congenial gentleman, who I later found out was working his first day there.  He should be the manager BTW, and treated us so courteously, the place was packed and although he estimated a 20 minute wait, we were seated much faster via a very high tech communications system.(Impressive!!) The bar staff, the wait staff and everyone there treated us as if we were ROYALTY and the food was DELICIOUS, especially the pizza made in a wood burning oven, confirmed by the stacked wood outside the restaurant! The specials are GREAT and I will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is very friendly, knowledgable in wines and beers, and always recommend the yummiest dishes and pizzas.   Great stop for a date or just a low key evening with friends.   Monday and Tuesdays they do $20 bottle of wine and pizza. Such a good deal."}
{"text":"We love coming here for lunch or dinner even though it's a 40 min drive for us! The food is THAT good!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza! The fig with arugula - melt in your mouth! Whenever I'm in Phoenix - I make a huge effort to eat some Federal Pizza. Can't wait till next time!"}
{"text":"Wow Upward Projects, what can't you do?  Congratulations on your take over of Central Ave.  With Federal, Windsor, and Postino there are choices for all.  Federal's pizza is baked deliciousness.  Unique combinations on each pizza and excellent starters to choose from compliment the menu and my stomach.  Sandwiches are great and all can be washed down with a great selection of draft beer.  My wife prefers the wine coolers which are very tasty I must admit.    Take home a Chub and anything from the menu.  Enjoy discounted drinks before 5pm.  Take your date here for a nice dinner.  Enjoy the outdoor seating and people, car watch with good food and drink.  Any way you choose to do it you should not be disappointed.   Thank you Upward, and my apologies to Windsor and Postino for the transfer of my business for the time present, but we will be back."}
{"text":"My best and I tried the Margherita pizza w/ the Mister Mister. -- Couldn't go wrong. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Just relocating from the Seattle WA area back to the valley I have been missing the trendy retro places that are not over priced with good food. And I scored with this one! Excellent job with decor and coziness. Outdoor eating is an option with warmers when it gets chilly.   Had the pizza with artichoke and also the pizza with pepperoni. The kids loved the pepperoni it had a great flavor. The Brussels sprout pizza was great but you really need to like the flavor of Brussels sprouts...which I do, so marvelous! Another great touch when the kids asked for Parmesan cheese they brought out fresh Parmesan and grated it over the pizza. So yummy!  The servers were very attentive and worked well as a team. My glass or my kids glasses were never empty. So well that I was not sure who exactly was my assigned server. I loved that!"}
{"text":"I love Federal Pizza. Always great food, good atmosphere and amazing dessert. They list pairings on their menu- which completes your meal even more. Unfortunately on one visit there was a mess up with my food, however the management went above and beyond to fix my dish and took GREAT care of us. Waits are considerably bad and with the parking lot across the street there's no more annoying \"complimentary valet.\"  My only complaint would be the lack of knowledge many of the staff have regarding certain food allergies. If I didn't have my dietary restrictions - I could eat here everyday!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere right away as we walked in and greeted with a friendly smile. Wait staff is spot on too.    A real breathe of fresh air in terms of friendly service that is utterly lacking in Bellevue, where an air of snobbiness exists.  The beer sampler was refreshing, crisp and cold, making the pizza all that much better."}
{"text":"The crust of these pizzas is amazing. My wife and I agreed we could eat a plain crust with no toppings and be delighted. Great atmosphere and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time for lunch over the weekend. We tried the Big Star. It had good flavor, however it lacked cheese and the crust was flimsy. I prefer not to have to use a fork and knife to eat pizza. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"My nephew recommended it to my brother,my sister in law and I. All four of us were there for the first time. What a great restaurant I recommend the Star."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Cool, laid-back atmosphere, personable service and great menu. We shared the meatball pizza and it was so fresh and delicious. Excellent dough with fresh, yummy mozzarella. And then the bambolina dessert - fresh donuts rolled in sugar with chocolate dipping sauce - is the best end to a great meal!!"}
{"text":"I always get their Mickey White pasta dish, along with a Great Little Salad. The pasta is so delicious, that I always bring half home, not because I can't eat it all, but because I want to have it again soon. It's creamy and garlicky, and has chicken, spinach, and perfectly al dente noodles. The Great Little Salad is wonderful! The lemon vinegarette is the perfect balance of tart and slightly sweet, and the greens are fresh and delicious with tiny strips of yellow beats. Both are so delicious, that I never order anything else, so I don't really know the other menu items well. Service was great and they keep your fresh tasting (thank you!) iced tea filled and even offered to send some to take with us."}
{"text":"It was our  wedding anniversary and the kids were at Grandma's. It was a Wednesday night. We were both finally off work, it was 8pm, and we wanted to try to fit in a little date to celebrate another year down. I was in the mood for pizza, so of course, we turn to Yelp. We wanted somewhere good, but not good enough to require me to get all fancied up. The reviews looked promising, so we said \"what the hey..\"  The weather was just chilly enough to not want to sit outside. We couldn't find the entrance, so we walked a circle around the entire building. It was a nice walk. We got to assess (and by assess I mean \"gossip about\") some couples on the patio. That was fun. Walked in, greeted right away by a nice lady. Sat at a table by the patio door. The view was nice. The bar was pretty. The crowd was a little bit hipster, a little bit normal people. It looked like there were a lot of first dates happening. Those are fun to watch.  The server was super sweet, I love that they're all wearing normal clothes.   The food was pretty good. We got some sort of appetizer, I forgot what it was called as soon as I ordered it. It looked like a whole bunch of fried stuff all piled together (not greasy gross fried, just fried), with 2 different dipping sauces. One green, one red. The red was better. For an entree, we shared a pizza. It was okay. We got the Big Star because all the others looked a little too weird (apple and sausage?... hmm) For dessert, we had doughnuts with the chocolate sauce. We got them because they make a similar dessert at Olive Garden, and we are obsessed with them. Well... I hate to say this, because I love small businesses, but olive garden's doughnut and chocolate sauce is a lot better. So it was a huge disappointment, but that's not necessarily their fault. Our expectations were probably too high. We also split a pitcher of beer. The total bill was 40 bucks plus tip. Not too shabby.  When we left, like, 5 employees smiled and said \"bye!! thanks for coming in!!\" Where did they find such pleasant people? I like it."}
{"text":"Amazing food quality!   I am not eating grains or dairy for a little bit, so you'd think I would have suffered here, lol, but on the contrary! I found there was plenty of choices for me to choose from and what I ordered turned out to be DELICIOUS!   To start I had a side of Veggies, which were Balsamic Braised Carrots & Broccolini. They were cooked and seasoned perfectly. The carrots were my favorite!! I would have eaten a few more orders of those had I been wearing elastic waist pants. I made a mental note ;)   My main course was a TLC Salad. It was composed of arugula, spring greens, beets, pears, smoked almonds & fennel with a citrus shallot vinaigrette. I had them hold the pecorino & add chicken. This was one of the most scrumptious salads I've ever had! With every bite there was a different burst of yumminess! The beets (of which I'm a big fan of now) and pear really made this salad. The chicken was cooked perfectly and was not the least bit dry, which I'm always afraid of. I am glad that I added the extra protein because the salad size is not large, so I would have been starvin marvin within an hour without it.   The service was excellent. There's lots of parking in the back. Both booths and tables are available and there was an outdoor seating area that faces Central.   There's also a drive through, which is really uncommon for a non fast-food place, lol. & from what I hear, you can order kegs to go..... ask more about that if you're interested, because I didn't probe for details, I was too busy imagining someone receiving a keg through a car window :D"}
{"text":"Federal Pizza is starting to piss me off. This is usually my go-to spot for pizza to go - my usual order: Brussel Sprout pizza and the meatball appetizer.   For the past few times, the pizza has not been good at all! The brussel sprouts weren't cooked enough, tasted raw and I had to put the pizza in the oven for several minutes before I can actually enjoy it. The meatballs are good, but the last time - the balls looked like they shrunk. What the hell is going on?!  Federal, I used to be your #1 Fan, now I am more like your #1 Frenemy."}
{"text":"This place was so good. The pesto pasta and margherita pizza was one of the best I've eaten. The downside to this place was the bathrooms. They were disgusting. I recommend eating here but go to the bathroom before you come."}
{"text":"Call me crazy but I am not a big fan of pizza which is why I found Federal to be spectacular. I ordered the chicken parm and the waiter advised me that it's not your typical plate where they place the chicken in pasta with tomato sauce all over it. He explained the way they do it and he made it sound so delicious I was sold. Let me say I am so glad I said yes because it was sooooo good! The sauce they put at the bottom was creamy with a spicy hit, the chicken was cooked to perfection. We came in to celebrate my friends birthday and everyone else had pizza and they said it was really tasty. The service was also very nice!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I've only been here once.  It was at a meeting a week ago with my work.  Best tip is that the parking is absolutely horrible, so come early or late, because the lot is so small and there is nothing on the street.  That being said,  I arrived with 5 other people and was greeted and seated warmly.   The waitress arrived promptly for drinks and orders.  I opted to get a classic, the margharita pizza with fresh mozz, tomatoes and basil, plus I added  roasted garlic.  It was delicious, with fresh hot house tomatoes, fresh torn basil leaves, stringy melted mozzarella, with garlic cloves mild and roasted to a perfect creaminess  and the crust was both delicate and chewy, exactly what you'd expect in a well executed pizza, but the absolute STAR and the one all my co-workers remember is the sweet potato and ricotta pizza.  It sounds unusual,  and it IS! Thin rounds of sweet potato roasted into the chewy, pillowy crust with generous dollops of creamy ricotta cheese and fresh sage scattered with it.  One of my co-workers shared it, a single slice each,  but THAT is the pizza we all remember and dream about!  Sweet, but not TOO sweet, creamy and luscious! It was like nothing I've ever had before.  And at $13 I thought it a bargain!  If I hadn't been headed out of town after our meeting I would have gotten one to bring home to my husband! I hope I am able to make it that way again,  just for this luscious, decadent treat.  I'm not a pizza  fan overall,  after 16 yrs in AZ I thought I wouldn't like pizza again,  but THIS pizza is one well worth a trip to central Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Pizza greatness! I've ate at quite a few pizza places around Phoenix and this has to be one of my favorites, as well as Grimaldis. The flavor is just what I want in a pizza. Can't go wrong. Wanting good quality pizza for dinner. Don't hesitate. Bring your a$$ down here haha :)"}
{"text":"What a great place! Just checked it out for happy hour on Friday afternoon and was most pleasantly surprised. They have nice booths in the middle and a very casual vibe and atmosphere. You can watch the dough boys making wood fired pizza and order beer to go in a growler which is actually quite reasonable and the equivalent of buying a 6 pack. They also have a nice wine list, but didn't have the wine we wanted, Dos Cabeza, on tap so we settled for some Pinot Noir.  One thing that is very cutting edge is that there is no assigned server to your table, instead all the waitstaff pitches in and gets you what you need, wethere it's refills or ordering more food. I asked if they pool their tips and they do I much prefer this style of service as it's very fast and much better than flagging down your waiter which in America people get an attitude about. That's one thing they could work on though is attitude, it seems almost a bit too hipsterish and when we mentioned Red Lobster to this waitress she looked at us like we were crazy. Too bad, I guess that's just a human trait. Overall I give this place 4 stars for atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"I have only given this restaurant a 3 start rating because of the food and beer. However, the service is by far the worst! It's a hit or miss. I have been a loyal patron since it first opened its doors, however, I never know what to expect from their pretentious, hipster staff! I like to think they will always be friendly and courteous but it's quite the opposite. Sitting at the bar they may or may not acknowledge you, not that I'm asking for much but knowing that you see me would be nice. I only wish their staff would be more attentive in order to give them a full 5 star review"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and watched the pizzas being made, super cool. Great customer service, very attentive, funny kitchen staff!"}
{"text":"Really great pizza, that's for sure. My server was a cute hipster girl with who seemed like she had a million other places she'd rather be. She wasn't rude directly to me, but it wasn't the friendliest service I've ever had.   Anyway, I got the Sweet Potato pizza. It tasted awesome, just not really $13 awesome. I don't think I'm too much of a pig, but I didn't really get that much food for what I was paying for.   I did like the beer selection, though. That was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Awesome drinks, great food, and awesome atmosphere. Fun place to meet up with good friends and grab some sangria and share tapas or pizza. I have celiac and still found things I could eat."}
{"text":"I'M Italian,vero Italiano. The first time was fantastic pizza, the second time the pizza was raw.  Service 5 stars ,pizza 2 stars"}
{"text":"The stuff needs much improvement in fact I was deemed unfit to drink anymore after I shared only one picture with a friend and I was very far from being grown also the pizza my friend found was not up to par either he thought it was going to be something else entirely but my meatball pasta was alright just be wary this is the lowest score ever given ever and there's a great cause for that"}
{"text":"Went with family to try this place out because they got a certificate.  The waitress was pretty rude. She walked away before we were done ordering and never brought us one of our drinks. She also failed to inform us of charges for extra items. With or without  a certificate I would never come to this place or recommend it... oh and what are their staff wearing? You can't tell customers from employees and one of the waitresses had a skirt so short she mine as well be naked."}
{"text":"The sangrias a the best with a variety to choose from! The pizza is thin crust yet flavorful. Nice bar seating area. There is an  available patio area as well! Oh yeah, and a drive thru!!!!"}
{"text":"What an awesome experience at Federal Pizza! We came around lunch time and just had a 10-15 minute wait which wasn't bad. The server was very friendly, suggested great items, and food turned out great! I was hesitant because I just had an unpleasant experience at one of the restaurants next door but I am happy that I tagged along to try it out!! I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time ordering pizza from Federal Pizza and all 3 times have been amazing!   Best pizza in town.  And I love the drive thru. Most places are closed on Easter, but I was so glad they were open today.  Lucky me. :)"}
{"text":"I rode to Federal Pizza on Sunday, Sep 18th for lunch around 1PM. I took a seat at the bar so I could watch the football game on TV.  The bartender tended to me quickly. I had never been here before, but heard great things.  I ordered the half-pizza/half-salad combo. The food was quite good, but what impressed me most was the service!  I was not drinking alcohol. The bartender consistently refilled my soda and water glasses, even offering me a \"to-go\" cup for my soda. He came back after I paid my bill (with credit card, tip already calculated) and offered to refill my glasses again. This was one of the few times I received great service even after the server had been paid. He deserved the additional cash tip I left for exceptional service.  To sum it up, while the food alone is a great reason to return to Federal Pizza, the service made the experience exceptional!"}
{"text":"Our Thursday choice. Enjoyed the pasta and pizza. Staff was friendly.   Tried again a few weeks later but the wait was a half hour. Speaks well for the food."}
{"text":"My bf and I went to Federal Pizza last night for dinner. I'd wanted to try the place since it opened, but I'm not often in the area around dinnertime. We'd been nearby and decided to hit up Federal and give it a try! I'm so glad we did.  Being a Friday night, I expected the wait would be a while, and the hostess quoted us a wait time of about 45 minutes. We went and sat outside, but the wait probably was no more than 25 which was nice. The ambiance inside is quite loud, so be prepared for the loud (but good!) music and the chatter of all the happy diners. I'd tried their grapefruit-ginger wine cooler at this year's Devoured, so I ordered that to drink, and it was as tasty as I remembered. I'd heard great things about the burrata appetizer, so we ordered that as well. At first, I was a tad bit underwhemled with the burrata, but the more I ate, the more it grew on me. The bread was crispy and slightly charred, with a good smokey flavor, and the burrata was super cold and complemented the bread nicely. It was a little salty for my taste, but with some of the fresh basil added to the cheese and bread, it was mighty delicious. I'd order this again in a heartbeat.  Where pizza is concerned, I was deciding between the brussels sprout pizza, the Gemini (with potatoes and goat cheese, I believe) or the Sweet Potato (sweet potatoes, ricotta ,sage). Let me tell you, I ordered the Sweet Potato and that ricotta cheese was the best I'd ever had in my life. I don't know what brand they use, or if it's made in-house, but damn was it good! The bottom crust was a little thin, but my pizza managed to keep it's integrity and didn't get soggy. The crust as a whole had great chew, was light as air, and had a great char from the wood-fired oven,  My bf went the simple route and ordered a pizza with pepperoni and sausage. The sausage was the best part because it came from Schreiner's, and come on, nothing from Schreiner's is bad. Great flavor! I added a piece of sausage to my sweet potato pizza and the flavors worked really well together.  No room for dessert this time around, but next time I'm definitely ordering the bombolini! My only gripe is that the prices seemed a bit steep for what you get, but I guess it's all their high-quality ingredients."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday afternoon. The place was semi busy, short wait to be seated. We ordered the Casanova pizza. Now my husband is a typical pepperoni and cheese, and our waiter suggested going outside the box, if we did not like it he'd put in an order for pepperoni. Man, are we ever glad we tried it! Savory, sweet, salty, fresh explosion in your mouth. That dates give it a semi hint of sweetness and the fresh arugula was just enough to give a fresh bite...  A must try!!! Trust me!!! The prices are just right, service was outstanding. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We already have a few preferred pizzerias in town, but decided to come here for Italian fare after reading a number of positive reviews on Yelp. During this visit, the long, spacious décor was modern, impressionable, and appropriate for all occasions. There were a mix of families and young professionals seated in-between the full bar and the open kitchen, as the natural sunlight came through the windows to transcend the dim parts of the interior. It was the first day of spring, so the sunny patio was also filled with diners overlooking Central Ave.   For starters, the Polenta arrived perfectly fried to render crispiness on the outside, and creamy and soft at the center. These polenta sticks came with romesco, a creamy nut-red pepper dipping sauce, that added another element to the flavors. By all measures, the profile of the polenta was spot-on and delicious.  The Casonova Pizza ($14.50) was put together with prosciutto, dates, ricotta, arugula and pecorino. The dates and thinly sliced prosciutto were delicious, but unevenly distributed across the pie, prompting these flavors to be a hit and miss. We were impressed by the sweet ricotta to accompany the lightly dressed arugula that covered the pie. However, the thin crust was not charred crispy or elastic enough to extend the wow factor. It was certainly more consequential than our next pie, but also a noticeable letdown noted by one of the previous reviewers. Overall, the Casonova was a lighter and sweeter option than those that are filled with heavy savory toppings, which added a nice contrast to our Manifesto Pizza.  That said, the Manifesto Pizza ($14.50) came with mushrooms, sausages, red sauce, goat cheese, and fennel. The mushrooms did not distinguish in terms of textures or taste, but the superiority of the sausage and the red sauce were unsurpassed. Unfortunately, we find the thin crust to be inconsistent in-between the pies, and a major weak link in the meal. The texture of the crust was not well executed, which steered our attention to the high quality toppings and ingredients instead of the whole pie.   Service was exceptionally attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. Every server and chef greeted us by making good eye contact with a warm smile. Our water was refilled consistently, and multiple servers came by to check on us throughout the visit. Our chef, Jesse, was so nice that he made a personalized pizza for one of our young dining companions. Their level of enthusiasm to attend to our needs was another major highlight in our visit. Interested diners can expect high quality ingredients, 5-star service, and a fantastic dining environment. 3.5 stars for the overall experience. We are definitely adding this pizzeria to the rotation as we look forward to trying their sweet potato pizza, meatball sandwich, homemade ravioli, and desserts."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite dinner spot! Awesome decor and atmosphere. Funky music and lively mood. Very well informed waiters. They were all willing to answer questions and take our order when we were ready. To quote my fav waiter, Jet: the food is \"magic in your mouth\" and he isn't exaggerating. The Big Star pizza and the veggie platter were delicious. They're not messing around in their kitchen."}
{"text":"Had awesome appetizers and some great beer on tap... and the pizza!!!!!!!!  OMG!  We lucked out with very little wait.  I would definatley go back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the service were both excellent, but it really comes down to the food. One of the best pizzas I've had anywhere in Phoenix! We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I would drive across town to eat a cheese pizza at this place!  The crust is great, the pizza flavors are creative and inventive. The ingredients are fresh.  The first time we went, the server suggested we try the Sweet Potato Pizza.  We were a little nervous because it sounded odd, but it was amazing!  We have never been disappointed!  We live in Mesa and it is worth the drive to central Phoenix for this great place!"}
{"text":"They are usually great! The last 4 times I've been there they've goofed up. The grease on the pizza was so bad it came out orange, it was pepperoni. They messed an order up, totally off. Can't make up there mind on how thick to make the Grinder, same table, ones thick and one isn't and today the bolognese was cold. I asked the waitress if they had a microwave, she simply said no and was off. I'm gonna give it some time to change before I return. The owners are suppose to be  great guys and I'm sure they'll get it straightened up when they notice. When it changes I'll rewrite  review."}
{"text":"Great fancy pizza joint.  Good selection of pizzas (My personal favorite is the prosciutto and date pizza) and a great craft beer.  They also have a call ahead drive through which is perfect when you want to have a Netflix and wine kind of night."}
{"text":"Federal is my new favorite place to eat!  Just the right amount of great staff, awesome food and a stellar collection of beers and cocktails.  Been here several times, Federal can do no wrong. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Yay for another restaurant from the Postino people!  The atmosphere is everything you've come to expect from Postino/LGO/Windsor/Churn - hip and minimalist with lots of tattoos. The prices are excellent - ~$12-14 for a pizza that is about right for 2 people. Pitchers of beer for $5, including some craft and local brews. Growlers for $15! The food was delicious. We had a pepperoni pizza and a specialty pizza with fig, arugula, goat cheese, and prosciutto. Both were good, but I really loved the specialty pie (can't remember the name now). The crust is very thin, but chewy instead of crunchy - similar to Bianco in that way. They have many different specialty options, but you can also make your own, mixing any combination of probably 40 different ingredients. Of course they have Schreiner's sausage, since that is all the rage in Phoenix these days. They also have a great patio for sitting outside when the weather is beautiful (like Thanksgiving weekend!). Parking in the lot is not plentiful, but there's typically enough on the neighboring streets."}
{"text":"Good pizza though it doesn't compare to Pizzeria Bianco, Cibo, Pizzeria Locale or Pomo. The crowd is of the \"too beautiful for school\" variety you'll find at other Uptown establishments like Windsor, Joyride and Postino.   There's generally very long waits on the weekend. That would be fine if they'd be willing to call you on your cell when your table is ready, but they refuse. Additionally the seating/waiting area on the west side of the building is very limited (even though there's tons of room to add additional benches). So while you wait instead of being able to stroll the lovely and historic Medlock Place neighborhood you have to idle about in a hot parking lot.  Calling customers who are on a 30 minute plus wait would be a very easy thing for Federal to do, and would earn them another star from me.  I do appreciate the building its in, it's great to see an Al Beadle building adaptively reused."}
{"text":"I take all of the friends I can get to Federal. It may be a little pricey for a broke college student like myself, but when sharing with a friend, it is well priced and worth the money! They have great happy hour specials and the pizzas are amazing. The staff is always very friendly and helpful when it comes to suggesting pizzas. I recommend the Casanova, I get it almost every time!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I love pizza with brussel sprouts, but I do, thanks to Federal Pizza... DE-LISH."}
{"text":"Favorite place in phoenix.   I am not a huge pizza fan and for me its not the pizza that makes this place.  Now the burrata cheese appetizer and chocolate dessert are what do it for me.  The burrata is amazing!  We normally don't get appetizers but went for a special occasion so decided to go all in.  The burrata is one of my fav dishes in phx.  The dessert would be my #1 fav dessert in phoenix.  The oreo crust, amazing chocolate mousse and then marshmallow topping is to die for.  Its even better than the Citizen Public Houses similar offering."}
{"text":"Federal Pizza is absolutely deserving of 5 stars. Amazing food, friendly staff, nice atmosphere. All around this place is great.  The boyfriend and I hit up Federal PIzza for lunch on a Saturday. It was busy but we were able to snag a comfy booth in the middle. Our waiter, I think his name was Dan, was immediately welcoming, funny and charming.   The menu has lots of yummy-sounding choices but we decided to try the wedge salad and the prosciutto pizza. The salad was a bit of a twist on the traditional wedge. It was made with romaine instead of iceberg (which was a welcome change) and had dates, tomatoes and ranch dressing with gorgonzola instead of the traditional bleu cheese. The size was generous - at least for two - and the flavor combinations worked well. A good start to the meal.  The pizza was out of this world. Loaded with fresh prosciutto, arugula, dates and ricotta cheese. This is easily my new favorite pizza in the valley. The crust was doughy and chewy in the best way possible and cooked perfectly. Every bite was delicious and surprisingly filling.  Of course we did save room for dessert (there's always room for dessert). We ordered the donuts with chocolate sauce. There were eight pretty big donuts covered in sugar and served hot. Not warn, hot. Yum. Dip those suckers in the chocolate sauce and you'll have a hot donut celebration. One thing I thought was a little weird was that they took our dinner plates and did not bring small plates for the donuts. Our table was a mess of sugar afterwards. But who cares, they were delish.  Overall I was very impressed with Federal Pizza. I already want to go back. Hopefully they will open one in the East Valley, pretty please???"}
{"text":"This swanky restaurant boasts to be delicious, modern, & hip! It's true- the ambience is very chill & relaxed with waiters rocking their Converse shoes & edgy attire & the waitresses  sporting cat-eye eyeliners & trendy blouses. The music is amazingly appropriate, but it's the food that must be raved about.  From their Arnold Palmer drink to their pairings of beer with the right pizza, this is what it's all about.  Start to finish, everything that came out of the kitchen and onto our table was nothing short of delicious. The pizza crust was phenomenal  crunchy and just the right size. Everything we ate looked very inviting.  This place-by far- is my favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"Last night I was in a positively lovely mood. I'd just come from a blissful vacation, eating some of the best bar-b-que this country has to offer in Kansas City. I'm not a picky eater by any stretch of the imagination, but my tastebuds are educated and I always appreciate care and quality in a meal and yesterday Federal Pizza offered that in spades.   My lovely date and I couldn't decide where to go for dinner. She'd been craving pasta for a week and wanted something simple but delicious that would satisfy the urge she'd built up in her mind. I like subtlety, elegance, and finesse. She's not the most adventurous eater but she loves trying new things and she trusts me, so when I decided we would start with the Mussels I knew there was a bit of risk involved. HOME-FRICKIN'-RUN! I don't know if it's a common order on a menu packed with delicious options and pizzas but since we weren't getting pizza this time, I thought mussels would be a great opener and boy was I right. There's a luscious sauce that perfectly accents but doesn't overpower the mussels, and they were fresh and tender and cooked with chorizo which gave the dish a lovely flavor and spice. I like to think chefs intentionally gift you a couple mussels out of the shell that hide under the rest, soaking in the sauce and waiting for you to think you're done. It may look like a technical oversight but once you put the sauce-soaked meat in your mouth, you realize the blessing that's been bestowed upon you. To accent this dish they provide a nicely grilled lemon halve which adds the perfect touch of acid, and two grilled slices of bread which we used, of course, for sopping. YUM!  For our entrees we went with the Spaghetti and Meatballs (her choice) and their \"Trust Us\" special of the evening - Linguini Carbonara. I have a rule about taking chef's suggestions; Always do it. Who cares what you like?! They know their ability and more important, they know the product. Oftentimes a chef will choose to highlight ingredients they've scored in their specials, or to show off their skills in some other regard. I saw the \"Trust Us\" sign on the board while walking in and I knew I was getting it from the jump. My lovely date had me pick a backup dish in case they'd run out of it. But surprise surprise, people in Phoenix don't like taking risks so I was the first one who ordered it! The pasta was perfectly cooked, balanced with a dreamy creamy sauce and evenly distributed pancetta and freshly grated parmesan cheese. It came topped with an egg, poached and then lightly breaded and fried. SO GOOD! Ugh, each bite was simply heaven. Carbonara is one of the simplest pastas to make, but it's complexity is in achieving the perfect balance of flavors and texture. In this regard the chef nailed it.   My lovely date thoroughly enjoyed her Spaghetti and Meatballs too. I tried some and the meatballs were just the right size, like Goldilocks kinda \"just right.\" The pomodoro, again a simple sauce, was executed judiciously. Fresh basil, perfect amount of cracked pepper. Primo.   Actually it was with this dish that their five stars were earned, as the portion size was large so my lovely date ended up asking for a box to take the rest home. We paid the check and left, but it took until we arrived at my place (I live a short distance away, not even three minutes driving) that we realized we'd left her box on the table. It was too good to chalk as a loss, so we turned around and headed back. Now, it would have been completely within their right to just toss the box after bussing the table. They would have lost nothing and we would have been sad but we also would have gotten over it. It's not like someone would have died. But they didn't. When I came back it was placed aside on the back register, where the nice hostess handed it to me.  I think I take for granted that I live in walking distance of such nice restaurants like Federal Pizza but I'm going to have to make it a point to drop by more often, as much for the food as for the care and thoughtfulness of the kitchen and front-of-house staff. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it has never disappointed. The sweet potato pizza and the Casanova pizza are top two! Their coolers are also amazing and cheap, 2 for $5! Our server Jesus was a pleasure. He offered us plenty of beer samples and recommended the Casanova. He was very attentive and took very good care of my whole family. The reason for 4 stars is because they did not have Corona  or Modelo for my dad. I will be a returning customer and I will recommend to everyone.   Thank you!!"}
{"text":"The Federal's location, (Central Ave) in northern part of downtown Phoenix, alone is desirable to folks working within Central corridor/downtown areas. Great stop for after-work apps or dinner!  I tried their Chicken Parm which had a unique sauce that made it a new experience for one of my old stand-bys. I tried my friend's Hawaiian pizza and it was thin and full of flavor. Hardly any grease.  Our server was a doll and checked in w/us frequently. On a Friday evening, I only had to wait 10 minutes for a table for 2. I also love that they offer free valet service.  Be prepared for a noisy dining experience - the place was packed and tables/booths are near one another. Try not to get annoyed (like I did initially); let the buzz of the lively patrons give you energy after a long day at work. :)"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave it 2 stars was for the polenta sticks. Pizza was better than Pizza Hut but not by far. The salad we for was supposed to have a vinegarette dressing, it just had oil. The room was nice, the service aloof."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza I've ever had! I had the Meatball Pizza and it was to die for. I'm normally not a fan of thin crust pizza but the crust they make is just perfect. And of course the fresh basil was just the perfect garnish on the heavenly pizza.  I also had the Blueberry Wine Cooler and it was just perfect for me since I was in the mood for some wine. I also tried the Mint Watermelon Wine Cooler and that one has a pretty interesting flavor. You wouldn't even be able to taste the wine in that one, so be careful!  Service was also amazing! My group took a while to get out orders in but our servers were very accommodating."}
{"text":"This is a good joint.  Very outgoing, the staff really does seem to care about getting things right.  The first time was average enough that I waited a good 60 days before trying it again.  Good pizza, small pizza's, excellent ingredients, wonderful soups, by the way."}
{"text":"Ive been having a huge craving for \"red sauce\" these days and decided to check out a new place. I had heard a ton of great things about this place so we decided to go.   First off, good luck finding the place. There is no signage on the street or building, we actually walked through the door to the hostess and asked if we were in the right place. We were.   We were seated quickly and the staff was all very nice. The music in this place is a touch to loud for a Monday afternoon lunch crowd.   For starters we ordered the meatball trio and the fried polenta sticks. Both were freaken amazinnnnng!!!!   For pizzas we ordered the standard Pepperoni and then also the Big Star. Both pizzas were good, but didn't knock my socks off. Also they were a bit greasy and the crust was pretty chewy and hard to cut through with a fork.  The hubs and I both agreed that we would most likely not be going back unless someone invited us out and that's where they wanted to go. It wasn't a terrible experience it was just meh for us."}
{"text":"Ate here last night and the food and service was very good. Every body there was super friendly and helpful and they all deserve a raise. Had burratta to start which came with some grilled bread which we liked. Also had a pizza with sausage, goat cheese, mushrooms and onions. Liked the crust it was nice and light and the toppings were all of high quality. Also had sides of brussels w/ pancetta and a meatball in sauce and both were good. Other pluses were the beer list and the wine list as well as the retro diner-like ambiance. Overall I would definitely recommend this place and I will be back but I must warn people who read reviews that compare this place to Bianco that it is not at that level. Not that they themselves are claiming that its just that every time a good pizza place opens up some yelp reviewers claim that Bianco has been bested or equalled and it just isn't the case. As long as you don't go in with those expectations you will find some pretty delicious pizza and some great drinks in a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"My first time here! Ordered half Casanova (no prosciutto) and half At Last. They accidentally gave us half The Answer (they sound similar) and were awesome enough to bring out a free pizza to correct the error. I didn't care for the At Last, I don't like corn on pizza or in pasta and I had to add salt for flavor. My friend loves it, though. I loved the Casanova, goat cheese and dates are an amazing combo. The bombolini dessert was yummy as well. Great, attentive service! I hope to come back soon, loved their crust."}
{"text":"Dinner for 5.  - Ambiance (5/5) Loved the outdoor patio  - Service (5/5) Super friendly, super fast service.  - Manifesto Pizza, $14 (4/5) Really great mushroom, sausage, and goat cheese toppings.  A tad bit soggy though, with toppings sliding off.  - Sweet Potato Pizza, $13 (5/5) Otherworldly delicious.  My colleagues kept raving about it, and now I understand why.  This one had perfect crust too.    - Value (4/5) One pizza is big enough to serve 1.5 people, so it's pretty decent value.    - Final Word Great pizzas (even for a self professed CT pizza snob).  Will be dreaming about that sweet potato pizza for a long time."}
{"text":"We had the best pizza EVER and the best spaghetti and meatballs EVER!! Great atmosphere, and Isaac made the experience worth coming back.  Great service too!"}
{"text":"We went during the first week it was open. We LOVE Windsor and Postino's so we really wanted to try out their new spot! The food... DELICIOUS! WE had the veggie board, and the sweet potato pizza. Both were great! I loved the food. :) The hostesses didn't seem to be on the same page though. We had one tell us we would be in a booth, and ask if we needed a high-chair, another come after to take us to our seats outside at a table, for 4 (we were a group of 5)  and again, ask us if we needed a high chair.  I will let all that slide since it was their first week. One other suggestion though.... Bike rack! Great location for bikers, but no place to lock up!  Also it seems kinda odd that there is no entrance from the street.   Overall, great food! Can't wait to go back and try some other pizzas!"}
{"text":"Great place for a craft beer and fresh pizza. Classy joint, but not too pricey. They even have take out too!"}
{"text":"After having made the wonderful discovery of Joyride shortly after moving to the midtown area, my fiancée and I were very curious about the pizza joint next door. We had put it off for a few months, because frankly there are a lot of really good pizza joints in Phoenix. Thankfully she suggested it tonight, because I really love Federal Pizza now. The ambiance was cool, TVs has March Madness on, and the food was really good. Our server was top notch, knew all of the specials, and was quick to make suggestions if we were unsure what to order. Excellent beer menu, if you're into craft beers, and the fiancée really enjoyed her wine cooler, per yelp suggestions. We had the Brussel sprout appetizer to start, which was good, but not mind blowing. The pizza though was top notch. I got a plain ole pepperoni and she got the At Last pizza. So freaking good. Both of them. I liked hers possibly more but I can't because I'm a meat eating beer drinking man. Jk but seriously good. You should try federal pizza. We want to eat outside next, I'm sure it will be great."}
{"text":"Pizza is delish. Salads are great. Beer is amazing. Service is good.  Covered parking.  Lunch specials. Happy Hour. Beer growlers available. Drive thru. I love this place.  It one of my lady's favorite spots."}
{"text":"Changing my review to 5 stars! After I left my previous review someone from Federal reached out to me, agreed that the meatballs cost too much and offered to send me a $50 gift card. I provided my address and received the gift card within a couple of days. I am so impressed with this restaurant and sincerely appreciate the awesome customer service! Thanks Federal Pizza!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were attempting to try Windsor across the street but they had a wait so we decided to try out Federal Pizza.  I wasn't really in the mood for pizza (weird, I know) but Joyride looked super busy.    I ordered the caprese sandwich and my daughter ordered the margherita pizza.  The sandwich was good, just your normal caprese though,  nothing special.  I tried a slice of pizza and I immediately fell in love!!  This thing literally melted in my mouth.  It doesn't look like much but this is an example of \"it tastes better than it looks\".  The olive oil they put on it is so rich and yummy and added a great touch!  Good crust and the cheese is yumm.  Service was great, our drinks were promptly refilled and everyone was super pleasant.    I think this might become my new favorite pizza place but just to be sure I have to come back and make sure."}
{"text":"Best lunch ever! My boyfriend and I went had such a great experience. The pizza I had was so fresh and delicious as was the salad -- super crisp greens and perfectly tossed with a yummy dressing. He had the meatball sub and it was to die for. Great service, really nice atmosphere, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Everyone super nice, appetizers good, but the pizza was not good, it was soggy. Ive been in the valley my whole life and have eaten at differnt pizza restaurants and we still have our favorites."}
{"text":"Buy a growler and take it home...okay you got me.  I was wary when I ordered my chef's whim pizza. I thought it literally was going to be made on the fly and whatever he felt like. It's actually just a daily special pizza. No you don't get a unique pizza to you. Sadly...thats what i was hoping for.  Instead it was a very vegetarian sounding pizza. It had beets and corn in it..which scared me.  I have never eaten beets before...so i was kind of scared. I went through with my decision...mostly because my wife made it for me. Good thing because the pizza was delicious. Not sure what beets are supposed to taste like...i thought they would be red, they were yellow..and sweet tasting. Is that normal? not sure but the pizza was good.  Anyways...ended the night with my growler in hand...+1 for me."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try Federal Pizza since they first opened up but kept putting it off because I felt like it was just going to be another pizza place. Boy was I wrong! Those guys and gals at Upwards Projects definitely know how to create a winning restaurant!   My husband and I stopped here for a late lunch and can't wait to come back. Since it was such a nice day, we sat on the cute patio and were able to enjoy the slight breeze. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. We ordered the Mister Mister - a platter of deep friend goodies. This included sweet potato, zucchini, artichokes, and mozzarella. The mozzarella was definitely my favorite. I liked the other vegetables as well, but the artichokes (which I normally love) didn't really do it for me. The leaves were too crispy.   For our pizza, we ordered the Brussels Sprout - roasted brussels sprouts, pancetta, and manchego cheese. Oh. Man. New favorite pizza. The crust was soft and crunchy, the sprouts were well cooked and tasty, and I loved the bite of the cheese. Mmm. We took home our leftovers and ate it for dinner that night! I would go back for this pizza alone, but they also have several other pizzas that look delicious.   I also want to go back to try their cobbler dessert (made with Churn ice cream) and I heard their homemade wine coolers are good. I'll definitely be back and soon!"}
{"text":"Been dying to try Federal Pizza...since we love Postinos, Joyride Tacos and Windsor. We met some of our foodie friends there, which was great because we got 4 different pizzas and shared...we all eat vegetarian too and there were such great options!  Here's what we had: -Gemini- excellent flavor - my husbands favorite...the Gorgonzola was the perfect cheese mixed with the other ingredients -Margherita- great and simplistic -At Last - super tastes with all the veggies...wish we would have not left off the goat cheese, but not everyone was a fan of goat cheese -Brussels Sprout - had to get it without pancetta...this one was my favorite! Super super flavorful...  The dough for the crust was delish! I would say this place ranked above Pizzeria Bianco for me...and I love Biancos.  We finished off the meal with dessert: Bombolini. Warm sugar donuts with chocolate dipping sauce...great end to the meal  I would highly recommended FP to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first on Friday the 25th of January. I came with two friends and we were pretty hungry. Since they only sell 12\" pizzas we decided to forego any appetizers and decided on two Pepperoni pizzas. The service was good, I like how they do team service. A few different waiters/waitresses came by to address our needs and to bring us drinks. One waitress would say do you guys need more drinks and then a totally different person would come by with our drinks. The Pizza itself was pretty good. I was a big fan of the giant pepperoni slices that cover the entire pizza. The sauce was ok, but the thing that endeared me to this pizza is the crust. The brick oven does wonders for it. It was crispy with some slight burnt spots on the outside (which I like) and the inside was nice and delicious. All in all this is a solid pizza spot."}
{"text":"I've had the opportunity to visit Federal Pizza several times since they first opened a few years ago. I hate admitting this, but on every single visit, I always end up leaving just a tad disappointed. Mind you, I've never wanted to confess why, as I feel doing so just makes me seem out of touch with what's trending in downtown Phoenix. But I'm going to go ahead and just flat out say it:  Their pizza just ain't that great. Period.    But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's a bad place, because I do feel that there's a lot of things that Federal does right. It's just that the one thing that they fail to do right, just happens to be the most crucial.  Located within a rather trendy area off of Central, Federal operates out of a building that used to be an old bank. The place has that manufactured retro design that fits in pretty consistently with the cluster of other restaurants in the area. Which makes sense, since they're all owned by the same company. Whether or not those things painted on the wall are quotation marks or floating sperm is currently debatable.  One must keep in mind, since these restaurants are all owned by the same company (Upward Projects), this somewhat sterilizes the whole \"local business\" feel. In other words, Federal never really had to \"grow\" as a business in order to build a core customer base. The advantages were already in place from the beginning.  But let's get to the food. For starters, we've had the Mister Mister, which is strangely absent from their online menu. We've also tried their \"seasonal\" burrata.  I'll glady admit that whatever burrata they're using here is prime stuff. Dare I say, it's the best burrata we've tasted - without going outside of Phoenix that is. A creamy texture that's just bursting with flavor, complimented by the awesome fig spread and evoo, I consider it a must-order. My only complaint: the skimpy crostini is an embarrassing inclusion. You get four of them, which combined, is the equivalent of maybe one slice of bread. Sadly, it will be gone before you're even halfway through the cheese. You're then forced to finish the remainder of the rather generous portion of the serving with a fork. I'm sorry, but burrata this good should be served on some thick cuts of house made bread, not paper-thin pathetic little slices of crostini. Another disadvantage, is that it's not always available due to being a seasonal item - even though I've never considered burrata to be seasonal. Whatever.  I'm willing to give them some props with their ordering. Federal allows you to order half-half, including combining red and white sides. This is something that few pizza places seem to allow, as they've developed this uppity attitude that doing so will, in fact, \"ruin\" the pizza. My girlfriend and I debunked this theory years ago, so I'm glad that Federal doesn't put up a fuss.  As for the pizzas: I'm not a big fan of their margherita, as they use whole tomato slices rather than just the sauce. Not that there's anything wrong with that approach. La Grande Orange also uses slices, and I still find their pizza to be some of the best in the city. My favorite of all of Federal's option is the Casanova, with the Brussels Sprout and At Last both being clever little creations that serve their purpose. Federal uses high quality ingredients, so they at least understand that aspect of pizza making. But every time I eat here, I'm quickly reminded of why I've never become a regular. Their crust just isn't very good. I typically associate great pizza with bubbly crust that has a nice char to it. This crust is soft, chewy, doughy, and according to my girlfriend, draws comparisons to the crust you'd find at Little Caesar's or Humble Pie.     The Lil' Triple is an excellent dessert, channeling their Churn toasted fluff to be layered on top of Oreo crumbles and chocolate cream/mousse. You can't go wrong with it. But again, things always change here, so I can't really recommend anything because there's no guarantee that it'll be available.    The servers have always been polite and pleasant, despite having some extremely slow service on some pretty dead evenings. Additionally, the restaurant itself is very wisely designed, incorporating heavy sound paneling into the ceiling. This really helps keep the volume under control in a place that can often get pretty crowded.  Like I said, there's good and there's bad. While it's a cool little place that offers some pretty decent selections. Unfortunately, I just can't bring myself to give it more than three stars due to their lackluster pizza crust. If your crust sucks, your pizza sucks.    I used to say it was worth the occasional visit, but I think we've now finally realized that if we want to burn 50 bucks on a dinner, there are far superior pizza places available."}
{"text":"This place is the cat's meow. A delightful experience.  Atmosphere is great. Love what they did with the place. Relaxing and trendy at the same time.  We chose to sit at the bar to skip the wait.  The bartender with the English accent had a great personality ... funny, informative.   We came on a Monday and chose to partake in their awesome $20 pizza and booze special. The wine and beer selection was great and had the same thought and care to it that Postinos has. We had ourselves a refreshing white blend, perfect for a hot and humid night.   We split some polenta sticks to start. They were good but underwhelming. The taste reminded me a bit of the fried macaroni and cheese from TGI Fridays. Can't figure out if that is a good thing... Next time I think we will split a salad to go with our pizza. They look scrumptious.  We chose the pizza with the brussel sprouts and manchego, but without the prosciutto. Yummmmm! Hard to believe I hated brussels as a kid. This pizza can make anyone eat their veggies! The crust was perfect. My husband loved it too and he usually doesn't care for pizza that doesn't have tomato sauce.   Although I loved the wine we were drinking I was insanely curious about their wine coolers. So my husband finished off the wine and I ordered the grapefruit ginger cooler. It went down way too easy. I can see how these can be addictive. And they pack quite the boozy punch.  While sitting at the bar I noticed they have a drive through. SHUT THE FRONT DOOR!! I almost fell out of my seat. So you are saying I can get one of their delicious pizzas AND their booze to go without even leaving my car? I can enjoy it in my pajamas with my booty planted on my couch while watching my nerdy BBC shows??   We asked if their patio was dog-friendly. Why yes it is. I can picture our dog at our feet on their cute little patio that overlooks Central after the weather isn't hellaciously hot anymore.   So yes, of course we would return. Duh. I would take Federal Pizza over a 3 hour wait and a side of pretentiousness at Pizzeria Bianco any day."}
{"text":"Great spot for a co workers bday party.  Food was perfect.  Wait staff was Johnny on the spot with everything.  The lunch deal was perfect and the Casanova pizza was great!"}
{"text":"Federal Pizza is honestly unlike any pizza place I've been to in Arizona. I went for my second visit last night and the Casanova keeps me coming back (try it, you won't regret it). The sweetness of the fig combined with richness of the ricotta is just absolutely amazing. And the crust... oh man it's good. We also ordered a half sweet potato and half brussel sprouts pizza which also didn't disappoint. I would choose the brussel sprouts over the sweet potato, but it was nice to try something new besides pepperoni and sausage. For dessert, you have to order to bombolini. They are amazing!  The only downside is limited parking and wait time, but both are worth it. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"The staff, overall vibe, tap beers, bar n all of federal is great; however, the food today was pretty weak. (I know they can do better n have done much better in the past) The pizza just had way too much crust, lacked sauce, the roasted onions had a bad after taste n there was a total of 2 olives on it. The wedge salad is done slightly diff here n it's one of my fav salads but I cld def do without the dates; untraditional, and the wedge doesn't need em."}
{"text":"Such a great atmosphere, amazing food, and the staff is so nice and accommodating. I had the Double Down (lunch special 7 days a week) that includes a 1/2 pizza and salad for only$10.50! I had the Manifesto pizza with sausage, mushrooms, goat cheese and fennel which was so good and the Caesar salad. I didn't have anything to complain about and will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times. The service was great and the atmosphere is nice, casual and laid back.  The pizza is alright. I've tried a couple different pizzas here. I didn't love the sauces they used and didn't love the crust texture or taste. However, I really enjoyed the food items that were not pizza here. Their sides, salads, and soups were tasty. I'm interested in trying their other menu items. I would come back here, but not for the pizza."}
{"text":"Wow!! New favorite place in the world! Have been here once before but it was so long ago I forgot about this little gem. Once you get thru the entrance (follow the arrows) be prepared for entry to pizza heaven!  The crust, it was so fresh the wheat must have been harvested that day!  Never had I tasted such good pizza 'bread'.  The sauce, toppings all were amazing. Went all veggie tonight but I had the pepperoni last time. Amazing from what I can remember.  The kids size was perfect to split (my kids are still little). If they wanted more we could have just ordered another but when I told them about the bombolini dessert (donuts) they were OK with just half the pizza each.   The dessert was amazing and a great size to share. The tap beers available were incredible. Nice strong 10%+ abv. beers as well as lighter choices. 7 day a week happy hour made a 9$ drink drop to $6. FANTASTIC SERVICE, AMBIANCE AND FOOD make this my new favorite place in the world!"}
{"text":"Came in for $20 pizza and bottle of wine special on Tuesday night and everything was super! The service was really nice and attentive without being suffocating. The cork on my rose bottle popped as we walked 100 feet away from the restaurant. The server wasn't kidding, it really is fun!!!"}
{"text":"Took my son out to lunch while visiting at college. Fun and trendy place."}
{"text":"It seems like I come here every Monday. Their 2 pitcher and pizza deal is off the god damn charts. They have quality beer and even more quality pizza.  You will not walk away disappointed if you dine here."}
{"text":"I was in town business and just left a Diamondbacks opening day game on March 31st. I was wanting pizza and yelped around for some places that was open. I found this place and was amazed with the good reviews. In addition this place was one of a few that was still open. Glad we picked this place. Staff welcomed us and sat us down. I ordered a pepperoni pizza. The pizza is one of the best I had. It had a unique flavor and it is wood fried. The crust is very crunchy and the tomato sauce is very good!!! The restaurant was very cozy with a lounge like atmosphere. They have a full bar with plenty of TVs. Next time I will come enjoy pizza and drink a few beers. Really cool place!! I recommend Federal Pizza to anyone looking for delicious pizza!!"}
{"text":"Margherita pizza, meatball pizza. . Fabulous crust!  Insanely friendly service.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Just went there for lunch today. They have a good \"double down\" deal - half sale and half a pizza for $10.50  between 11am-4pm. I had the chicken panzanella and the big star pizza. I finished most of the order. The service was good as well there."}
{"text":"The food was great and the wait staff was very pleasant. The atmosphere was very cozy. The only problem was needing to switch tables after ordering. We were seated outside on a beautiful night; however, there was a man sitting next to us speaking at a very high volume swearing every other word. The staff was accommodating and switched our table but the man was so loud you could hear him from inside! Aside from that they do have great food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Its got a cool casual feel to it..I love the \"Shorty\" beer glasses they have.Must have for trying on different beers. The warm donuts with the hot chocolate sauce is a sinful delight that is hard to resist."}
{"text":"I so wish that I could give Federal a better review but it just was so mediocre I can't. There's just nothing that stands out here to tell you about.   We had the wedge, spaghetti and meatballs, supergrinder and pizza. It was all eatable and not bad but just so lackluster.   I'll stick to Windsor or Postino."}
{"text":"The food here is extremely good and the service has always been impeccable.  The one time something came out that was sub par, the waitress apologized profusely and removed it from the bill.  Once they also accidentally brought the wrong pizza, but quickly corrected it and comped it.  Great atmosphere and no snobbery. Fast friendly service at lunch time."}
{"text":"One word: Porcetta! Probably one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten (even better than the Porkwich across the street at Windsor)! The pizzas here are pretty amazing as well, and if you get there before 5 the drink specials are unbeatable!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here, even more so than Windsor.  Fresh ingredients, yummy pizza, love their crust, and good variety of drinks.  They even have a drive through!  Similar to Postinos, they have Monday and Tuesday night specials where you can get a whole pizza and a bottle of wine or 2 pitchers of beer for $20."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! the Arancini, and the Margherita pizza are phenomenal!!!!"}
{"text":"Um, YUM!  What a great menu for unique pizza. This isn't your average pizza parlor, rather it focuses more on gourmet pizza.  I was lucky as I was on  a food tour, so I was able to really sample a huge amount of their pizzas. I was really excited for the brussel sprout pizza (say what?) as I love them, but my favorite was the Big Star. Delish.  YOu can also get beer to go now!  Heck yeah! And a drive thru is now available."}
{"text":"It's good, but there's better out there. I would definitely choose this place over a chain pizza place though. It is pricey-happy hour drink specials are the way to go if you are boozing a little.  Join the email club to get a free pizza which will also help on the cost.  Good Friday night place to go with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Dan the bartender was a pretty nice and casual guy. Music had a nice peppy rhythm to it. I grabbed a little lunch at the bar. Everything was pretty perfect including the breeze coming through the back doors.  I like this place. Very nice people and atmosphere.  I ate the wedge. Well done!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love every restaurant these guys roll out.  They've done it again with Federal Pizza.  There are a lot of great places to get pies in this town but only a few good sit down and drink and eat pizza places.  I love LGO but it's all the way in Arcadia.  This place is just as good.    We tried the brussel sprout pizza w/pancetta (I was sceptical but it was awesome) and the meatball pizza.  The meatballs here are a 3 meat mixture including veal and schreiners sausage.  It was unbelievable.    Ok, the beer.  Growlers (64oz) of ANY of the drafts are $15 and $10 to refill.  Apparently if you order food to go you get a 50% discount on beer to go which means $5 growler refills.  I'll be coming here quite often.  The beers are diverse and unique.  I picked up a growler of Green Flash IPA (8% ABV) and because they just opened I got it for $10 to start.  Such an awesome deal.  GET OVER HERE RIGHT NOW AND TRY IT!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love going to this local spot. I've been a few times now and was sold on it the other  night when we went for a late bite. 10:30 PM and the place was still packed. Had a pitcher of beer, shared an app, a salad and the arugula, dates, prosciutto and ricotta pizza...it was perfect! The service was great, everyone that was working was attentive and helpful. They even recognized us the next morning when we walked by on our way home to get coffee! I would recommend this place...for lunch, dinner, a prolonged weekend lunch or a quick late night meal. I will be back."}
{"text":"Upward Projects...I challenge you to open a place that I don't like. Actually, don't. Pretty sure it's impossible anyway.   I went to Federal Pizza for lunch with my mom today and let me tell you...I was not disappointed in any sense of the word. The vibe is laid back, the layout is open, and the decor is natural and minimalistic while being stylish at the same time. We struggled between sitting at the bar or at a table as we're used to doing bar at Postino and table at Windsor but the booth won.   Our server, Jared, gave us enough time to actually look at the drink menu without leaving us wondering if we had a server which was nice. Settled on the Sean Minor pinot noir which I kind of cheated on because I've had it and it's yummy. Light with just enough flavor.  We decided to get the margherita pizza with prosciutto and arugula on half as well as the spaghetti and meatballs and a side salad for me. The pizza was absolutely delicious...the prosciutto added just enough salt to balance out the arugula covered with lemon dressing and the crust was awesome; not too tough and not too doughy. The spaghetti and meatballs were tasty and the meatballs had a good kick to them. Side salad was pretty basic; mixed greens, beets, and a vinaigrette dressing that was really good.   Service was attentive without being overbearing (I'm a server and I appreciate check ups but not every 5 minutes. I promise I'm a little more laid back than that!). I only wish I had tried the dessert as they all sounded fantastic but this is definitely not the last time I'll be going to Federal so I'm sure I'll make room for it on the next trip."}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza. Oily & messy- as it should be. I was trying to get a taste while driving back w it and it fell apart. So, i just shoved the slice in my mouth like a neanderthal.  I did that 3 times."}
{"text":"We were seated, were given watwr2 then ignored for 20 minutes. A waitress passed our table at least 7 times....was too busy tending to the larger parties around us. I have been here before and was treated decent. So i dont know its just an off day of us service is deteriorating. I'm very disappointed especially after telling my son how good the food was. F- today"}
{"text":"Pizza. Perfectly charred, amazingly topped, finger licking good, brick oven style pizza. That is what Federal is servin up with every order...  I haven't eaten here enough to satisfy my curiosity with how they get all of that crunchy goodness into every. single. freaking. bite!  First time I went to Federal Pizza sonny man ate an entire cheese pizza on his own. I mean the kid likes pizza but even I was amazed that he put the whole thing away! I got a single bite of one of his slices... (** disclaimer ** my child is not obese! He's tall and lanky and has the metabolism of an Olympic swimmer)   My mom and I split the Big Star and had a few slices each to take home for the next day. Big Star is all kinds of goodness, olives, mushrooms, bell peppers, more olives, and I don't remember what else. So good! No drinks this time as I was driving home with precious cargo.  The next time I ordered the Manifesto (** I wish they would split the specialty pies. I hope they figure that out soon). This pizza was topped with sausage, mushrooms, feta cheese, and probably some other good stuff I can't recall at the moment. I also ordered the Grapefruit Ginger Cooler, be careful because this is delish and it will, I repeat it will get you buzzin.   There is so, so, so much on the menu that I am killin to try. Uh yeah and I have to get me a growler full of brew to go! Maybe tomorrow for an end of the world jam I'm going to! NTS: get growler.  You know there is something special about the decor here also. Orange booths, raised just a tad. Open view to the kitchen area. Long bar. Groovy chandelier. Amazing patio with red chairs. Love it. Like the rest of the Upward Projects restaurants this is a favourite for me in this city. Lots of hipster vibe with both the staff and the patrons. I dig it."}
{"text":"I have tried several of their pizzas since my friends and I like to share and every single one is delish! Don't even bother with Bianco anymore... skip the wait and crowded dining room and head to Federal instead."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Phoenix! My wife and I came here for the first time last week and were so sad that we didn't know that this place existed for the past 30 years!"}
{"text":"Omg... this place is bomb! If you haven't been here you are missing out. Monday and Tuesday are the best specials. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite place but went anyway.. Waitress with an attitude!! Everything we asked her for was treated like an imposition!  The food is ok but the service is consistently  poor!  The Music blared so loud we could not hear each other talk,  we  couldn't even complain loud enough! When we asked our waitress if the music could be turned down she had ask us what we said because she couldn't hear us. (The answer was... I will ask but the owner usually won't let us....)Hard to believe its the same ownership as Windsor and Postinos!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza crust! The fresh ingredients and flavors of the meatball pizza was surprisingly excellent! Service was great too!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place after meeting up at Lux one day. It's a nice little pizza place, overall a good experience."}
{"text":"My second time dining at Federal was much better.  A margherita pizza done right, a very fresh salad of beets, sweet pears and pecorino, a nice little list of local wines, and wonderful service (read: I'm an adult bartender, not a lame little hipster pretending to be one )."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE EXACT COMPLAINT I FILED WITH THE BBB:  Sunday, June 30th, 2013, my boyfriend picked up our favorite pizza in the valley to eat for an early lunch, the Federal.  Immediately after eating we were both feeling a little off, slight stomach pains, a little bloated but no biggie.  We thought maybe we had over eaten.  By 8:00pm that night I ended up on the floor of my house vomiting profusely into a bowl as I could not reach the bathroom the food poisoning was so severe.    July 1, 2013, I woke up to severe dehydration, and with severe muscle and kidney pain from the extensive vomiting and other lovely experiences I had the entire night.  Unfortunately, my body had gone into such a state of dehydration, that it began to halt the function of my organs. Namely, my esophagus, my lungs, my muscles and my bladder.  Unable to walk, my boyfriend carried me to his truck and sped like a maniac to the hospital.  Arriving at the hospital, the Drs did an MRI and did not like the sound of my heart and I ended up staying in the hospital getting bags upon bags of saline to aid in my severe dehydration.   After a $300 ER bill, two missed days of work for my boyfriend (he was sick too but less so) and three missed days of work for myself, I decided to email the Federal, July 7th, 2013, after recuperating for a week.  I did not ask for compensation, I was not rude or out of line. I wrote the email coming from a concerned patron that feels that something should be done to avoid this ever happening in the future.   What I got was an email back (July 12, 2013) from a Craig Demarco, an owner of Upward Projects, who vilely requested that we handle this matter over the phone.  No problem, I understand that you do not want anything in writing for me to use against you.  Even though I expressly stated I was not out to get them, I was out to incite a change in how the restaurant serves its food.  I agreed to do so and handed over my phone number and gave some times that we could talk, and said if those times didn't work, we should coordinate a better time.   It is officially one week later (July, 19th, 2013) and no response.  Not a call, not an email, not a care. This expresses a complete lack of decorum and respect for the diners that come in to the Federal, and I cannot be less impressed with their actions.  I am disgusted with how this has been handled and really do thank them for really exhibiting how they handle delicate matters such as this.  By not handling them at all.  Update: June 19, 2014 - Nobody from this restaurant or any of the owners have contacted me about my experience.  Still no love."}
{"text":"Best place to get pizza. My boyfriend and I come here on the regular for pepperoni, sausage, garlic, and fresh basil pizza (we build our own), buffalo wings (so delicious and addicting), and beer (they have a great selection with $5 pitchers before 5 pm). Everything is so fresh and delicious and never disappoints. The pizza dough is so light and wood fired to perfection. We once saw a man seated next to us at the bar with a plate full of pizza crusts he didn't eat, which was so surprising to us because the crust is the best part. Sandwiches are great too. We have yet to try their pasta, though. The interior has a sort of retro vibe to it with casual atmosphere. Overall a very fine establishment with amazing food. We will never stop coming here."}
{"text":"Incredibly innovative. Down right sexy interior, fantastic and brave beer selections and the pizza. Good lord the pizza. Fantastic service. One step through the door and you find all the worries of the world melt away. Can not wait to go back. The general manager Aj is a gem who fell from the clouds and our server was a pro."}
{"text":"Upward restuarants does it again.  I love the concept of revamping old buildings.  The food was good.  Service good.  We just happened to hit the first night of official business.  Pizza and friend polenta was carb over-load but so good.  Trendy and cool.  I am nostalgic for the old Humpty Dumpty building next door, that housed the closed Aeillos, this will be the next venture.  Central Avenue is moving and shaking."}
{"text":"Wood fired brussel sprout pizza topped with manchego cheese, lemon zest, and panchetta. Good lord this pizza is so good. For me, Federal Pizza is my favorite pizza in Arizona (okay it's a tie with Bills Pizza in Prescott). But this particular pizza-that probably sounds strange-works. The sharp cheese and hint of lemon is delicious. I am obsessed with this pizza, so much so it's hard for me to order anything else. I've even tried recreating it at home! Hands down, this pizza with fluffy crust is so amazing.   Okay so maybe you hate Brussels sprouts, I get it. But all Federal Pizza is good pizza. I recommend the meatball pizza-I love it because the meatballs aren't giant globes atop the pizza, they slice them so you get them in every bite. I also recommend their house made wine coolers which pairs unique flavors like blood orange and cardamom. Fun fact: Federal got its name because it used to be a bank."}
{"text":"If your on central and do not visit this place, shame on you. Get the chefs whim.  Service may seem slow but it's only because they work so hard to handle everyone equally. Atmosphere is fabulous and the $5 pitchers until 5pm are not a bad deal either.  Come soon and come often."}
{"text":"I love Postino, Windsor and Churn so this was next on my list to try. I had a coupon for a free entree/pasta so my mom and I gave it a shot. The atmosphere is very cute, modern and in a great location!   We ordered: Arancini - always a great appetizer, was perfectly fried and full of flavor Meatball Pizza - everything was great, pizza was a little soggy and had to be eaten with fork/knife, but didn't bother us Garganelli Pasta - perfect blend of ingredients and very light  There are many other items on the menu that I would like to try, so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After a lot of hype about Federal I was excited to try it. The restaurant was nicely decorated and laid out, we sat on the patio which was pretty noisy and had to fight some flies. I asked about the wine coolers and the waitress responded with \"i hate them\" I probed further and she indicated she didn't care for sweet but I was a bit surprised by her bluntness. We shared a ceasar salad which was a great portion size and very tasty (perhaps a bit salty) and a pizza with Shriner's sausage (yum) and gorgonzola. The pizza was good, one of the better ones I have had in Central Phoenix but not the best. I would come back and will probably sit inside or order through the cute drive -thru."}
{"text":"Really loved this place the atmosphere along with the food. We ordered the veggie sandwich and I was blown away with how good it was.  The only downside of this evening was the parking."}
{"text":"I'm surprised the Postino/Upward guys have put out a sub-par restaurant. Its not like them at all. Maybe they need time. If you like eating burnt pizzas in a room with the music so loud it sounds like you're in the trunk of a low-rider then this is the place for you. It was lunch time so the music should be scaled back to suit the patrons, not the wait staff. Maybe its more appropriate at night but lunch time is usually conversation time. The menu is small...8 pizzas, 4 sandwiches and 3 desserts. Just very surprised that every pizza that was delivered to us and our surrounding tables had a black, burned crust. The sandwich was outstanding....but this is called Federal PIZZA. I'll try again in a month to see if they have improved."}
{"text":"Four of us went to Federal Pizza for their $20 special on Tuesdays after 8pm ($20 pizza and a bottle of wine or 2 pitchers of beer) and experienced the best customer service! We were greeted immediately at the door and told about the app NoWait that enables you to \"enter\" the line on your way to the restaurant to reduce wait time by the hostess. Once we were seated, we placed our orders rather quickly and received a \"welcome pizza\"! (While it was a wonderful surprise, it is not a normal circumstance to be expected at every visit) Between the four of us, we ordered 2 pitchers of beer, one bottle of wine, 2 salads, and 2 pizzas and the food was incredible! One of the pizzas was slightly burnt (we wouldn't have complained) and the man who brought it out immediately stated that we would be getting another(!) pizza as a replacement to go since he felt it was burnt by their standards! I will be going back frequently and highly recommend the great food and absolutely superb customer service."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Pizza is on point. Pizza is Neapolitan style. Service is hit or miss. Some of the servers just don't seem to want to be there. Others are super jazzed about the menu. Prefer the latter. Came for my birthday last night. It was my birthday. Had to ask for the dessert menu. Decided against dessert. Blew out the table votive candle. I guess I can say not a place for birthdays. Pizza is good. I had the Margherita."}
{"text":"Satisfaction Guaranteed! I was feeling Italian tonight so i insisted to go here. We sat at the kitchen bar because there was a 30min wait, of coarse dinner rush.. I've tried the margherita before so that's what I ordered and my boyfriend ordered meatball spaghetti. As expected, the pizza was good. I love how the tomatoes are cooked, blackened a little bit by the fired-brick oven. Our pasta came, so i tried it first. I don't know if it's undercooked but it was kinda hard, which I didn't mind. My boyfriend tried it and he also agreed. So we just kept eating our pizza, since we ate at the kitchen bar, the pizza chef asked us how our pizza was? We replied good! But i told him about the pasta was hard. So he told the other chef who made it. The chef then came to us and asked us if he can make a new one. I'm glad that they went above our expectations and did something about it, without us asking to prepare a new one. They also didn't charge me for the meatball spaghetti. We will definitely come back to try the answer (pizza) which was recommended by the pizza chef."}
{"text":"I love most of Upward Projects group of restaurants. This is one of them. The prices here are pretty fair and are about the same as all their competitors. I just got a pepperoni and sausage pizza. They use high quality ingredients in their pizza so you can tell when you take a bite how amazing each ingredient is on its own. The place is always poppin' it seems like. The layout of the restaurant is interesting, but fun. I enjoyed myself while here. They get pretty busy, but we didn't have to wait. The server was friendly and accommodating. You won't regret coming here and check out other Upward Projects restaurants while you are at it. They have some great ones!"}
{"text":"After a few correspondences from corporate, I was sent a gift car to return to federal pizza. I have yet to do so but I appreciate the company reaching out and correcting the mistake that happened"}
{"text":"Woohoo, I finally visit a place that's newly opened! Ahead of the curve for once! :)  Visited Federal Pizza after the great review from Chow Bella (I think...) regarding the Corn Coins. Went after work on a Thursday, and while the place was very busy, my friend and I were seated immediately.  Service was a little slow, but, like I said, it was very busy. Plus, the extra time gave us plenty of time to debate the menu and choose what we wanted!  We ended up ordering the At Last pizza, Corn Coins, and wine coolers (I had the hibiscus one-- delicious!)  The pizza was GREAT!! It has chiles on it, which adds a little spice and unexpected flavor. The crust held all the veggies really well, but the veggies didn't even overwhelm the pizza. All in all, great!  My friend didn't exactly like the thin crust, but as long as you know it's thinner crust pizza going in, you should be okay.  Disappointing? The Corn Coins. They got a great review from the New Times, but I just didn't like them. I don't know what I was expecting, but they were messy to eat, corn got all up in our teeth, and it was just generally 'meh.' If you love corn, or know what you're getting into with corn coins, go for it! I just wouldn't order it again. Also-- NOT recommended for first dates!  Unexpectedly amazing? The WINE COOLERS! Oh yeah buddy! They bring you the wine cooler in an old school glass bottle that you then pour yourself into a wine glass filled with ice.  My (raspberry? can't remember) hibiscus wine cooler was awesome!! Surprisingly strong, and incredibly delicious. I think I'm going to get 5... I mean 2... the next time I go to FP!  It was ~$20 for both of us, with an appetizer, a split pizza, and drinks. The only other thing I wasn't a fan of was the parking... I KNOW the owners of FP (along with their other restaurants) love doing the complimentary valet parking, I'm just not a fan of having to carry dollars around with me for tip. I don't really carry money around at all, and it's just something else to remember.  All said though, I'll go back. Mostly because of those wine coolers :)"}
{"text":"So, this is for take out only. As you can tell from the 5 stars, I'm a big fan. I'm picky about my pizza, and if you're going to go avant-garde on the toppings, they had better be well thought out. And these are. Date and prosciutto with ricotta and argula? Perfectly executed salty/sweet/creamy. Brussel sprout with manchego? Well cooked sprouts with pancetta is an winning combo. Chili/corn/broccolini/goat cheese? I'm not a vegetarian, but if I could eat this pizza all the time, I'd be fine with it (watch for the slow burn, the heat will catch up with you). The crust is nice and thin, well cooked and well seasoned, and the sauce is bright and fresh. If you're looking for a top-notch pizza joint with something other than your usual pepperoni, this is your spot."}
{"text":"The food has always been good. This review is to echo the numerous other reviews about poor customer service.  Please address this at all levels...  It sucks when you really want to be a regular, but roll the dice when you sit down."}
{"text":"Amazing pizzas and Fantastic customer service. We got half Casanova and half sweet potato with prosciutto added mmmmmmm mmmmm It was amazing. This is my new favorite pizza place.... The burrata is gooey deliciousness too!"}
{"text":"Mondays and Tuesdays are super radical.  $20 for two pitchers of beer (or a bottle of wine) and a pizza.  Too good to pass up."}
{"text":"So yummy....  Ate there again for lunch today.  Good service, great pizza and salad.  Great lunch deal.  Love the drive through for weekend nights."}
{"text":"Out of this world!  Went with the folks for lunch.  It was bustling so we sat at the bar.  Great decor, great building.  The music was too loud, but that just seems to be the way it goes at hip restaurants nowadays....They brought us out a free appetizer almost immediately. We didnt look a gift horse in the mouth and very much enjoyed the fried veggies and polenta sticks we were given.  Mom ordered the beet and pear salad and made yummy noises the whole time she ate it.  It was lovely, but then I'm a beet slut.  Dad had a pepperoni pizza and was very happy.  The pizza's crust was perfect!  I stumbled upon the porchetta sandwich and even Tony Soprano would order this from Federal on the regular.  It may be the best sandwich ever.  So simple yet complex, the bread was divine, the pork super flavorful....I want one now.  BTW, you can order takeout and they have a drive thru window.....and you can leave there with your own growler of various fancy ales.  Just awesome........kudos!"}
{"text":"I admit there is better pizza in Phoenix than most cities I have been to, and this is not the best we have to offer.  But it's pretty good and gets 4 stars for pleasant staff and convenience of the drive through pick up."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! My group of friends had the most friendly, prompt waitress in the history of the world. And the pizza was perfect.  GO THERE ON A MONDAY!  You can get either 2 pizzas + 1 pitcher of beer (or something like that) or one pizza and a bottle of wine for $20. And the waitress was like, \"Get the most expensive wine for the best deal.\" So I did.  Just go. It's not too loud, not too quiet. On a steamy evening July it was a little warm inside (that's what she...never mind.). But who cares.  I'm going to have to go back and back to try the rest of the menu. Oh, and I got the margherita pizza. Everything about it was perfect. I can taste the delish dough in my watering mouth right now.  Oh, there's a drive-through!"}
{"text":"Chicken parm dish was great!! I recommend trying one of their homemade wine coolers!!! Very cool ambiance, with a beautiful patio."}
{"text":"Good food and good beer. A little pricey for a smaller Sized pizza and pitcher of beer but he ambiance and customer service makes up for it. I recommend. 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Great wood oven pizza, fantastic setting, over the top service. Mgr Tammy took extra care of us!"}
{"text":"Because of a whole in our pizza, they gave us a whole new pizza for free which we boxed up and took home thanks FP!!!!"}
{"text":"We ate here two nights ago for the first time. The best thing about this place and that it is a nice sit down restaurant but it also has a drive through for take out. The pizza was delicious and I would absolutely go here again and recommend this place for sit down and take out."}
{"text":"Beyond delicious. I sampled a few different things today and was impressed. The blueberry hibiscus wine cooler is enough to get me back there!"}
{"text":"Tried the Casanova with all the toppings a I now have my favorite pizza in Phoenix! The crust is delicious and so Is the mix of flavors. We also ordered the Brussel sprout pizza and it is sooooi good. They also have amazing customer service. Loved it!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great. We've come here for a couple years now. Josh (one of the people who answers the phone) is extremely rude and shouldn't be answering phone calls. This has happened several occasions and has turned us off from going/ordering from here lately. It's not cool to feel like I shouldn't be calling a place that does take out orders because the person on the other side is extremely rude!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Went with a group of 8 and had a great time. Love the $20 for any pizza and either a bottle of wine or two pitchers of beer. You can even take the wine home if you don't finish it. Besides that, the food was delicious and the service was excellent. I'm a vegan and our server and the kitchen were very accommodating. I ordered a vegetable board, and when one of the servers (not even mine or the one I made the order to) saw that it wasn't vegan, she had them redo it and comped it from my bill. It was delicious. I also had a vegan pizza and it was excellent. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"I've always loved pizza. It's probably the one food item I could eat everyday. Since I finally had the opportunity to try the famous pizza place in Phoenix (which I didn't care for at all), I've wanted to explore other local pizzerias to determine who really had the best pizza in the Valley. I had found Federal through a Yelp search and I've been wanting to try it for a while.  I finally went last week. We were seated on their outdoor patio right away. We went on a Sunday around 3 and they were having a happy hour. However, neither of us got drinks. I think we had about 3 different people ask us if we wanted drinks, I guess they were just being thorough. I've also been on an artichoke kick lately so we got the Big Artichoke. It was definitely big and very good. The truffle oil wasn't too pungent or strong. The seasoning was great and it wasn't too buttery or oily as some places prepare it. Just as we were about to finish, our pizza came.  We got the Margherita pizza with fresh parmesan on top. The fresh parmesan was so good and not like anything else I've had before. The pizza was also delicious. The cheese was great and had that slightly crispy burnt cheese taste where the cheese met the crust. The crust was also crispy and really good.   My boyfriend and I both agreed that this was the best pizza we've had so far in AZ. However, we do have another place I want to check out before I can officially crown Federal as my favorite. Until then, Federal is definitely somewhere we'll have to go back to. We also walked to Churn which is right across the street for some dessert which was a perfect way to end a perfect meal."}
{"text":"Great thin crust New York style pizza. We were looking for a quick bite and were not disappointed. We ate outside on a nice patio with a modern az feel. Good choice of beverages, but the pizza? Total yum."}
{"text":"The wine coolers are dangerously good!~"}
{"text":"I would give the place 4.5 stars. The dough and quality of cheeses and meats used is just superb. Too far from north phoenix and can't get it with Ubereats!"}
{"text":"My wife and I discovered this place recently when looking for eateries open after 9 p.m. I have heard it mentioned a time or two among friends but never tried it until now. We were both very pleasantly surprised. The food was great despite the pizza being much different than what we are accustomed to it was delicious. The prices were very reasonable as well. And to top it off the soundtrack in this place is great,  damn near the exact same tunes I play in my own business and it definitely give this place a good vibe. We've already decided that we are regulars from this point forward."}
{"text":"So are you guys going to to have water or do you want anything else... The food was great but the service from our server was lackluster. We got a salad, two pizzas, three appetizers, two glasses of wine and a pitcher yet our server seemed to think we were going to be a table of water and pizza. Food was great but our server couldn't get it right. Missed drinks and wrong orders; for my first time at Federal Pizza, I don't know if I'd necessarily come back as a result of the service."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed a fair share of pizza in my life and I have to say Federal's margherita pizza was one of the best! We stopped by for a late dinner and were greeted with a nice selection of craft brews and delicious food options. The staff was friendly and laid back and had a good knowledge of both the beer and the food. We settled on the simplest of pizzas they serve but were blown away by how good it was with juicy tomatoes and light crust. Sadly, we live in San Diego but will know where to go when we come back to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The pizza is AMAZING but the hospitality is even better! We were eating here for the second time this week, when a couple of middle-aged women were perpetually giving my family the stink eye as my baby made happy noises throughout dinner, I got fed up and decided to leave the table and my hot pizza and walk my baby around out front. Another woman (whom I think was the manager) made sure to stop me on my way out and remind me that it was a family restaurant and that I shouldn't worry about anyone else and that my family had every right to be eating there as anyone else."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the last 6 months, and every experience has been perfect. Nights out with friends, dates, and a fathers day meal with dad have all proved to be fantastic. The decor and atmosphere just absolutely incredible, and the staff is friendly and stylish. Be sure to ask what the Chef's Whim is.. today was SO AWESOME! Mortadella with pistachio, caramelized onions and pesto! Woo! The Big Star is my favorite. They also have brilliant selection of great beers and wines. The beers are so well priced.. you can't afford *not* to drink beer at Federal Pizza! ALSO! The SOUND SYSTEM here is incredible!"}
{"text":"I received a coupon from Upward Bound for a BOGO for a lunch item during the week - so my husband and myself after seeing a film at the Arizona Center decided to try it on New Years Day.  It was very busy - seemed to be lots of out of town visitors.  The service was very good and so was the food - my husband had the pizza with pepperoni and I had the mushroom ravioli.  We both took part in their homemade wine coolers - my husband had the strawberry/rhubarb and I had the raspberry/lavender.  Not sweet at all and we got a deal on those too.  They were $5.00 instead of $8.00 - maybe because it was before 5:00????    Just a warning when you go, the building is not marked as Federal Pizza and the entrance is off of the (free!) parking lot behind the building - the entrance is not marked either.  Regardless, give it a try - I'm glad we did and we'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"You will love this place! We found Federal Pizza using Yelp while visiting our daughter at Grand Canyon University (GCU) from CO. Great food, ambiance, and the service is top notch. Kuddos to Dan and his staff!"}
{"text":"Heard about this gem from friends. Loved the atmosphere very laid back. The price point was great. Super budget friendly. The food was really quality. Brussels were awesome, the wings were very crispy and delicious. The pizza didn't blow me away... but it was a good pie for AZ. I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Can't rate the sit down experience, but the take out I picked up last night was Delicious.  The gal who answered the phone to take my order was sharp (not always the case in my experience), efficient, and professional... with a little added warmth to make you feel served even on the phone.  I arrived a little early to grab my Zaa and decided to drive to the drive up door.  I was greeted at my window promptly and my food was brought out to my car! Sadly no roller skates, but hey car side service is pretty sweet!  Pizza was really good, crust perfect, toppings excellent, defiantly fits the upper echelon pies in the area. On par with Parlor, Humble Pie for sure.  Will update after I make it back for a sit down... also I heard a rumor that they have half price Growlers for take out!  Going back for sure!"}
{"text":"My friends and I did lunch at the newly opened Federal Pizza. It was pretty busy for 11 A.M., and after going there, I can understand why.  The decor is awesome. Unique salt & pepper shakers at each table, a long bar, open-sided booths, and an open kitchen. Plus, there is a drive-thru pick-up window.   We ordered the fig & prosciutto, the margarita, and the corn & green chili pizza. While I think I actually like Humble Pie's pizzas better (they're both of the same wood-fired style, but Humple Pie's flavors are richer and there isn't as much crust), these pies were tasty. Lots of toppings and fresh ingredients. They go light on the cheese, but that's okay. Makes you feel less guilty about eating half of an entire pizza.  The best part of the meal, though? The wine coolers. These aren't some Seabreeze or Boonsfarm stuff. These are fantastically flavored, bubbly, and refreshing coolers. And at $5 for a bottle full, they're a screaming deal.  (All their beer pitchers, wine coolers, and glasses of wine are $5 before 5 PM, FYI.)  I did see some of the pasta and salad dishes folks ordered, and they looked pretty darn tasty.  Needless to say, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm down for pizza any day of the week day or night!  I've been meaning to try this place since first hearing about it, but I never found myself on that side of town.  Lucky for me I was attending an event just a few miles from their location.  Walked right in and the place was busy.  We ended up sitting at the bar so that we wouldn't have to wait for a table.  The bartender was friendly and made us feel welcomed.  Hands down on the pepperoni pizza.  A 12\" was just enough to get my fix.  We also ordered the chopped salad which was fresh to death!  I'm putting this place in my top 10 pizza joints to eat a pie.  You can't go wrong with the food or the location.    Pizza pie till I die!"}
{"text":"While I quite enjoy the pizza here, I fail to see what the uproar is about.  The margherita pizza is good, but I guess once you've had NY pizza, nothing else can compare (my apologies for sounding like a pizza snob).  The meatball pizza is delicious, but I would recommend to get it without onions if you're not a fan because they tend to overdo the onions here.  Overall, I'd go back, but it's not a must for me."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, and service! And Churn is across the street. The Parlor has some good competition!"}
{"text":"Great pizza joint.  So glad we came here.  Explore the menu.  Did I mention:  BOMB PIZZA"}
{"text":"Federal has some amazing pizza combinations. The Casanova is a real winner as well as the brussel sprout pizza for me. The Casanova has prosciutto, ricotta, dates, and fresh arugula combining sweet, salty, and a tad of spice from the arugula making for an awesome flavor combo. Love love love it. I always enjoying hearing the chef's whim which is a random pizza concoction that the chef thinks up for that day--always different, always delicious.   When just going for a snack the polenta is tasty and comes in fried little sticks with a dipping sauce, and only $4.   Federal has a great draft beer selection and as the other Upward Projects restaurants offers it's before 5pm specials... This time wine, draft beer, or in-house made wine coolers.  Wonderful place to kick back on the patio and enjoy life :)"}
{"text":"After my favorite eatery in the neighborhood closed in 2015 I was avoiding the vicinity. But I finally returned to dine on Central and Camelback. Someone told me to stop being a pouty brat. (I can't use the exact words that were said to me because this is a family website.)  Service at Federal Pizza is a cut above all pizza joints. They treat customers like they're dining at a classy establishment. We got our glasses repeatedly refilled, dirty dishes promptly cleared away, and all the staff were aware of our table.  The F&A veggie board was good (I would def order again), the salad was good (would def reorder) and the polenta was good (would reorder). The romesco sauce was fantastic. Where has it been all my life? The pizza was so-so.  From the pictures on Yelp, I was hesitant to try the pizza because I didn't think I would like the crust. But crust tasted okay and the pizza was saucy. The downside: the crust is weak and requires some attention getting it off the tray without spilling off the toppings, there was very little cheese, the toppings were overly sweet.   So most likely I will probably not reorder pizza. But I was happy with the veggie selections and FP is a good place to be."}
{"text":"A lot as changed since my original review of Federal Pizza. I am now gluten intolerant. I wish that it was just a phase or something trendy that I'm trying out, but not the case. Sadly,  Federal needs to update their menu to accommodate the gluten challenged people. No GF pizza crust which seems unusual because their thing is pizza. There is a GF pasta option, but they charge an additional $3.00 for the pasta. I feel ripped off and disappointed. I enjoyed Federal for 3 years, but I will no longer be dining here until/unless they offer a GF crust and come down on the increase on the GF pasta."}
{"text":"I was there for lunch on a Saturday. It was fantastic in every way. The porchetta sandwich was brilliant. Would recommend splitting the porchetta sandwich with a pizza with friends. We has the Casanova Pizza. It was incredible. The pizza was like a four-part harmony with the fig as the soprano soaring over the chord. The pecorino served as a nice and sharp bass note while the rest melded together beautifully. Top 3 pizza in my life.   Had a wine cooler. Interesting, but I should've known that I wouldn't want all of that sweetness. Much more of a beer guy. Speaking of, you must get the Sierra Nevada Hefe. It's one of the best I've ever had.  Beautiful restaurant, happy people that care about the food. This is a must.  (Sorry for the shoddy writing, I tapped this out on my phone)"}
{"text":"Awesome place! I called in to get pizza and had never been here before. Because there was a mix up, they ended up giving me two pizzas for free. Amazing customer service, fantastic management and great food. Couldn't ask for anything better. Plus, the pizza was absolutely divine. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs to a slice! Just be advised they only sell one size of pizza- a 12in."}
{"text":"I recently moved back to Phx from San Francisco, so needless to say, I'm a little spoiled on the restaurant front. So far, I've been happy with the direction that Phx restaurants are taking and I really enjoyed Federal Pizza.  A friend and I visited this weekend and we had the burrata appetizer and the Big Red pizza. Both were amazingly good. They had a great selection of local and craft beers and a good wine list. We didn't have dessert b/c we were full, but I certainly would like to try some of what they had on the menu.  They are down a star for one reason - OPEN TABLE - heard of it? For pete's sake TAKE F%#@ING RESERVATIONS, at least on the weekends. It's super good food and people are going to go there. It would be so much easier if one didn't have to wait 1.5 hours to get in. It takes the pressure off you guys. If I've been waiting for hours, it had better be some flipping good pizza. Reservations. Take them. We'll all be happier."}
{"text":"I knew seeing the picture of the pizza i was already going to like it. This place is amazing and on top of it they have a drive thru! Ugh yesss! The place is cozy inside and the food smells wonderful! The service is a little bit off though i feel like they are too comfortable where it takes away from the good service. I dont mind being called sister or girlfriend but if i was on a date or a more formal meeting i dont think that would be ohk.. But all in all the food was amazing! Im craving it again today and i just had it last night! Hate to say it but i ate the whole pizza to myself.."}
{"text":"This place was so amazing! It is literally the 1st time...although both delicious...I like the crust more than the pizza. Light and fluffy while still being crispy..if that makes any sense. Coming from a true pizza snob...this place is legit. I don't know how I got so lucky to only pay $10.50 for a personal sized serving and a blue cheese and bacon wedge salad. Also had the polenta sticks that were out of this world good. This place is nestled in the cutest area of central Phoenix surrounded by beautiful trees and open windows. It's in an area with other super cool and modern restaurants. Perfect destination for a Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"I heard so many great things about this place! So when Joycie said she was going to have her birthday here, I was ecstatic!   Apparently they don't take reservations on Saturday so most of her party got there around 6:40 so we could get a table by 7. Well that didn't happen. We were seated around 8 at TWO different tables because they said they couldn't put two tables together because of some lame excuse. At this point, we just wanted to eat.   Onto the food! I got the margherita pizza. I didn't like it. The pizza tasted like feet. The only reason I even ate as much as I did was because I was starving. However, everyone else seemed to enjoy their food.   Service was eh. Could have been better. The prices are pretty good.   I was expecting so much more from here since I love the upward project restaurants."}
{"text":"My mom watches a lot of Food Network. Why does that matter? Because any time I want to have a food adventure, she's down. I call her up, say we're going to a new pizza place, and it's go time.  We came here at that weird period on a weekday between lunch and dinner, so there was literally only one other customer in the restaurant. Nice! Where I used to feel awkward being in a mostly empty establishment, I've learned there are some great things about it.  1) I can check the place out without people being all up in my way. First impression is this place is aesthetically pleasing, and there's quite a bit of attention to detail. I can see why \"hipsters\" are drawn here. More importantly, everything looked shiny and clean.  2) I get to see how the the place runs when everyone's not \"on.\" You know what I mean. Things are different when it isn't showtime.   Though I'm not a big meat-eater, we went for the meatball trio and the side of beets to start.   The meatballs were awesome, flavorful, and the perfect texture, and the marinara was right on. The real star of the dish was the polenta, with a perfect crunch on the outside and creamy inside. There was a bit of fork-shoving to get the last of it.  Beets and pears are a great combination, but we both felt like it was lacking something until we snagged a bottle of balsamic vinegar.   For the pizza we shared the margherita with added roasted garlic (our server's favorite as well, what a coinkidink!). The crust was unlike any I've had before. Not at all chewy, light and airy with a nice crispiness without being like a cracker. I really enjoyed it.  I would have loved to try the wine coolers, but $8? Come on.  After all that goodness, I didn't have room to try the cobbler. The great news is, they have a drive-thru, so I'll get my chance!"}
{"text":"Phoenix is lowkey one of the best places In America for good pizza. I've already got a half-dozen exceptional, go-to places throughout the valley, and every time I think the market might be saturated, I make my way into a new parlor that shows me we've still got ground to cover. A lot of the time, when I am going to enjoy a gourmet pizza, I want something that's 'super duper Italian' with imported everything, and crust made with Old World secrets.   Federal Pizza isn't trying to be like that. It's going its own way, and doing a fantastic job.   Ingredients are unique, and to an extent locally sourced. My friend and I split the Manifesto, with generous portions of Schreiner's sausage as well as goat cheese. On the side, we had polenta sticks. I thought these were strange, but with the dipping sauce they came with, I couldn't stop reaching for them! I must also note these pizzas are deceptively heavy, so splitting a pie and an app with a friend is not only reasonable, but surprisingly affordable.  You will be amazed at how low your bill will be as you leave satisfied.   You will be enchanted by the swift, friendly service.   And if you're like me, you're going to leave a little extra happy after seeing the small but legit beer selection.   tl;dr If you like pizza, get in here ASAP."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood hang out. Only wish they had HH foods and a HH that lasted past 5pm so that those who work could attend. I really love meat loaf so I ordered that for dinner. It did not resemble meatloaf at all nor did it taste the same.  You know the taste the flavored bread crumbs adds to it.  It was more like a hamburger that fell apart. Or maybe if they called it Salisbury steak it would be more appropriate. The employees were just great as was the pitcher of beer. Due to this I will give it 4 stars. I MAY try the pizza nest time although I am a pizza snob and in my 25+ years in Phoenix have found only 1 place that makes Sicilian Pizza just like in The Big Apple. So I am not too sure that I will return here"}
{"text":"I came here once before and thought it was good so I decided to try it out again. I brought my friend with me and we ordered half margherita pizza and half Casanova. It's my fault for not reading the menu carefully when I ordered these two because they turned out to be white pizza. The margherita pizza looked like it wasn't freshly cooked and they just threw couple pieces of basil and tomatoes on it. When I took a bite out of it, I wasn't very pleased with it. It basically tasted what it looked like, which was mostly dough lol. The other pizza tasted plain too, but once I bit the date, it tasted better. The dates had a sweet taste to it which balanced out nicely with the prosciutto. Overall, the food wasn't so great this time, but the Service was."}
{"text":"Pizza: Really creative combinations, all of which are good. My favorites are Sweet Potato (sweet potato, sage, and ricotta) and Cassanova (dates, prosciutto, ricotta). Even the Brussels Sprout (roasted in balsamic + garlic) is tasty. Order one per person.   Drink: Solid and cheap beer selection. Never had wine here, but they've got a lengthy list.   Service: Friendly hipster service staff.   Ambiance: Pretty standard stuff. More a restaurant than a pizzeria. The outside patio is right on Central and so a bit loud.   Price: Beer=cheap. Pizzas about $12-14 each.   Bottom line: Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is hopping and has quite the reputation for their pizza so I was excited to give it a whirl. My friend and I decided to find the best pizza places in town over the course of a week (we worked out a lot that week), and Federal Pizza was on our list to try. It was crowded when we came, but we valeted the car and snagged a couple spots at the bar right away, so there was no wait! Sitting at the bar isn't usually my favorite place to be, but it was quite entertaining because we got to watch the guys make the pizza and they gave us the inside scoop on what to order and what to drink.   We decided to order the Casanova pizza, Manifesto pizza, and the Caesar salad. We also indulged in a couple blueberry hibiscus wine coolers. The pizza took a while to come out, but they were very busy and it is nice to know you are getting freshly made pizza straight from the oven. The salad was good, but nothing to write home about, and the drinks were just so so. When the pizza finally did come we dug right in! The Casanova was fantastic; prosciutto, dates, and ricotta go together so well! The manifesto was pretty good, but not our favorite. Overall we enjoyed this trendy pizza spot, but it wasn't the best that we tried that week. For me it is all in the dough, and this dough was lacking that wow flavor that is worthy of 5 stars. If we are in the area and craving pizza we will stop in again, but we both agreed we probably won't go out of our way to come here. The atmosphere is crowded and loud, so picking up pizza to go might be a better way to go."}
{"text":"I love postinos.  I love Windsor.  I love Churn. I knew I would love Federal. What I did not expect was for it to introduce me to my absolute favorite pizza in the world.   The aptly named Casanova stole my heart. As I read through the list of pies all sounded good, but the Casanova was a notch above the rest.  Its description read like a really alluring internet dating profile.  Prosciutto, dates and ricotta might as well have read well educated, good family, great smile, arugula was just icing on the cake, like having the same favorite band.  I was sold.   We all know a well written e-harmony profile does not insure success.  What looks great on paper does not necessarily equate to that special spark.  I nervously waited for my pizza, hoping it would be everything I hoped for.  Meanwhile I enjoyed a wine cooler. Not the \"hey look guys, I totally scored us some booze\" Bartles & Jaymes wine coolers of my teenage years, no these were more sophisticated and much tastier. I went with the raspberry lavender and was very pleased.  17 year old me was soo jelly. Then he arrived.  On time, dressed neatly.  I coyly eyed him before grabbing a slice, then dove right in. People, the sparks were there.  Love exists, it's real.  The Casanova was everything I had dreamed of.   I don't want to get to ahead of myself, but I for-see a long and happy relationship."}
{"text":"This place is on point! They have awesome almost close to New York Pizza which was the debate at the table.  Service was attentive. Only down side was they only have beer and wine. Which for me being a beer guy was on point since they make their own beer.  However my girl wanted a mixer and they don't have that so she went beer classic also.  Definitely check it out and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Little Gem Caesar . . . perfect for two to share.  Big Star pizza . . . so good!  Loved the decor!  Beer, food and tip came to just under $40.  LOVED this place!  Nice feel on the inside and out.  Great decor.  Candles were such a nice touch.  Loved sitting at the bar.  Bartender and server were very pleasant.  Music was loud but just loud enough (you could still have a conversation).  Best part is it's in my neighborhood.  Welcome to the neighborhood Federal Pizza.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Service was so so... Pizza was 6.5/10.... Spaghetti was under cooked.... Beer was ...... The $5 Coors light bottle was cold.... But the meatballs were good.... Wouldn't eat there regularly if I lived here in town... Just ok..."}
{"text":"They have great specials without compromising quality. I had a delicious lunch. The place has a great vibe to it. Our server Angel was fantastic! He took great care of us and was very knowledgeable about their wine selection. Look forward to coming here again!"}
{"text":"I was there last Friday for an early dinner. The food was very good. The reason I am giving it 1 star is for the service. The woman who dropped our pizza off seemed irritated and was very rude. Bad service is something that irks me when I'm dinning out."}
{"text":"Lunch was amazing! Service outstanding! Food was incredible!  We sat outside and had the half-pizza/salad combo. WOW! Fresh, tasty and fast."}
{"text":"Federal Pizza is in a fantastic location, right next to Joyride (good Mexican) and Postino's wine bar, on Central just south of Camelback. Had the CASTELVETRANO OLIVES as appetizer to share and they were crisp and flavorful. For main course, the sweet potato pizza is definitely unique and tasty if you like sweet potato. If not, I've also had the At Last pizza and was not disappointed. What makes a good pizza in my opinion is the crust, and the crust has the oven fired taste. It's somewhat crispy, thin, and has an authentic Italian taste. Honestly, at Federal you are mainly there for the trendy environment and experience. Sit outside on the patio and enjoy some wine. Great location."}
{"text":"I'm sitting in my car waiting for a pizza that was promised 15 minutes ago.  Hope it's good because a second chance is unlikely.  Called 45 minutes ahead for a good 'za to take home for movie night, waited until they told me it would be ready and here I sit. The pizza finally comes with appropriate apologies. Can't argue about the quality of the pie: Schreiner's sausage, tasty mushrooms, MJ crust  - all good - but it's a pizza.  You shouldn't have to wait at the pickup window longer than it takes to make the pizza from scratch.   Even the best food tastes bitter after a bad experience with service."}
{"text":"When in doubt- choose federal. They are extremely accommodating- I've called in lunch orders at opening and they have them ready for me at the drive through in 20 minutes, they seat large groups, and their servers are genuinely friendly and attentive. I love sitting out on the patio and enjoying their music playlist. They need to publish their pandora station because it never fails.   I have yet to eat a pizza here I don't like. The Casanova is my personal favorite with prosciutto, dates, ricotta cheese and sauce. The perfect savory sweet combination. The manifesto, the answer, the sweet potato and even the Brussel sprout pizzas won't let you down! On their menu they also let you know what drink pairs well with it.   I would suggest sticking to their pizza. When I saw the warm donuts and chocolate sauce on the dessert menu, I was practically drooling on my pizza, but I was not overwhelmed by the dessert when I tried it. The donuts were a little airy and not very flavorful."}
{"text":"No need to add to the raves about the food, but I wanted to speak up about the great service we got last night at Federal. It was a Friday night and we had reservations for 5 people at 7pm.   We only had one of our party there by 7, and they seated him without giving him any pushback about needing the whole party there. Three more of us arrived by 7:30,and the last person was there by 8. Not once did anyone give us trouble about monopolozing a table, and they even let the last person order her pizza when she arrived.   The dinner was a going-away celebration for a very good friend who has had a very rough time lately, and it was a much-needed send-off for all of us.   Thanks, FP, for recognizing that we are going to spend money at your establishment even if we're a little late. Sometimes planes don't arrive on time, trucks don't get packed as quickly as we intend, and emotions run high when you're picking up your life and moving across the country. Thanks for helping us relax at the end of a hard day."}
{"text":"We visited on a Friday for lunch. We were seated right away. I ordered the \"Double Down\" lunch deal, where I got to choose half a pizza and a half-salad or soup. I ordered the half Casanova and chicken panzanella salad, and an apple spice wine cooler. The drink was delicious, like a really fresh apple cider. I liked the dough of the pizza--good, chewy, with bubbles in the crust, but I have had better. I enjoyed the sweet combination of toppings, and the softness of the hot ricotta was divine. The salad was good but had only two chunks of fresh mozzarella (mind you, those were tasty chunks). My husband had a full meatball pizza, which he liked but didn't think it was the best around. I tried a slice, and I agreed--it wasn't bad by any means, but it didn't have a zing to it, either. He had two Epicenter beers.  The service was an issue, too. Our server was MIA most of the time. All the other servers would pass by, see us looking around, and tend to us. Our server would then show up and see everything was taken care of and go to the opposite side of the dining room again. We were grateful that the rest of the staff was attentive!  We don't go to downtown Phoenix very often and there are a lot of choices there. While we liked Federal Pizza, I doubt we'll make a return visit."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, Great service. A bit pricey, but oh boy it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Came back again for another try of their pizza, this time with the Manifesto. Goat cheese, sausage, fennel and mushrooms - oh my! So yummy, baked well and the goat cheese gives it that slight, bright tartness to liven the pizza up. This time around, there was no beer to be ordered but I had a craving for a Strawberry Lemonade for the hot night ... unfortunately Jared said they don't do Strawberry Lemonade but they do fresh squeezed lemonade and actually recommended they could do a muddled Strawberry Rhubarb puree added to the lemonade since thats what they have at the bar. Absolutely perfect, tangy, refreshing and damn that was brilliant. I got to try the Strawberry Rhubarb wine cooler and woo, those these are strong and tasty.  It's always a pleasuring dining in here and having Jared as our server! Can't wait to be back for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Great service, good pizza, fair prices. Awesome deals going on during weekdays. Make sure you try the wine, it's delicious, or you can sample before you buy. Friendly service."}
{"text":"If you dine here, dine on the patio. The ambience is quaint and comfortable. The pizza is different, but in a good way. The brussel sprout pizza is the absolute shiz."}
{"text":"They are now doing $20 night here Monday's and Tuesday's after 8!  This is a legendary deal at Postino, and I like it even better here at Federal because they have a drivethru!  I sped right thru the first time not seeing the actual drivethru, but the gal was nice enough to open the sliding door during my second pass so I could see that I was in the right place.  The $20 will get you any bottle of their wines also served by the glass, and any pizza.  They have a great wine selection (a lot of the same as Postis) so I stuck with my summer jam which is always the Ca Del Sarto pinot grigio, crisp and refreshing in this heat, and tried the Big Star pizza which I worried would be a little busy but was really well done!  I learned a little trick when doing take out pizza - I put about 4 slices in a pan on the stove set over medium low heat while I open the wine and prepare a salad accompaniment.  This really makes the pizza crisp up, and you get to have it nice and hot at your convenience.  I foresee never cooking again on Mondays."}
{"text":"This place is like walking back in time. Great service , Great food and cute art decor.    I always get the spaghetti and meatballs which you think won't be good but its to die for. The margarita pizza is the best."}
{"text":"First, I want to say I love trying different pizza. I'd say I have experience. If I could give 10 stars for service alone, I would! My cup never went empty. Dishes never piled up on the table. Everyone who works here looks out for each other's tables. I'm soooo beyond impressed. It's busy too and you would never notice because the service is flawless.                                Next is the food. The pizza crust is soft and tastes like perfection. I can taste all the flavors the pizza has to offer. Not too cheesy..just enough sauce. What can I say?? I'll be back!! Prices are good too. $13 for 12in pizza that tastes so incredibly good.                   They also have a drive threw for those who don't want the dine in experience."}
{"text":"Maybe I come here too much. For instance, I know that it is exactly 367 steps from my door to Federal's. But the pizza is just so good, it's hard to not want to go everyday! My favorite pizzas are the Big Star and Margarita. The brussel sprouts are also amazing. I went with a group one day, including one small child, and even he liked the brussel sprouts! If that's not a testament to how good they are, I don't know what is.  They also have the same great happy hour as Windsor/Postino, with the addition of house-made wine coolers and beer growlers to go. $15 to buy the growler, but only $10 to get it filled. If you're in the mood for dessert, definitely get the donut holes with chocolate sauce. I'm not a big chocolate person, but I find myself covering the donuts with it.  As much as I like Federal, I have had a couple of disappointments. I tried the ravioli one night and they were very bland. I also got the wedge salad to go, and it seemed like it was mostly \"wedge\" without many toppings.  While there may be some misses at Federal, I will definitely keep coming back for the pizza."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo yummy! I've had pizza, salads and dessert and it's all awesome!"}
{"text":"Not your average pepperoni place.  Their flavor combinations are so refreshing.  Great prices,  great service,  great beer,  great prices.  I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"Very pleased with federal pizza! The environment is excellent and the service was great as well. We ordered a bottle of wine and pizza... Loved the pizza!!!"}
{"text":"I freakin love this restaurant! However, let me make myself clear my Love of Federal pizza does not stem from any kind of stupendous customer service experience I have had at the restaurant. In fact I love, going here so much exactly because my experiences with their customer service are so hilariously bad. Let me attempt to explain my oxymoronic explanation of my relationship with Federal Pizza. This restaurant does not have bad customer service on purpose like one of those restaurants that are rude to you on purpose. In fact the wait staff does not seem to have an attitude problem at all and they have always seemed very pleasant. The problem appears to either be a problem with the culture at the restaurant or with their management. Every time I have eaten here I have had to have a meal comped, receiving a voucher for a future meal comp, or redeeming a meal comp because they can never get my order right. Even one time when I came in to redeem a meal comp for a free entree, the waitress forgot to put in my order and it took nearly and hour and a half to get my food! And because the waitress sucked so bad she had to give me 2 more freebees for future visits! This is why I love getting such bad service, because when this happens they feed me for free! Over the past several months eating at Federal has been a huge cution to my budget. I swear to god I make more money eating at this restaurant than I have actually spent here. In the past 3 times I have eaten here I think I have only had to spend $3 when I went in today because my drink was not covered on one of the vouchers they gave me. But even when I went in today the bartender freakin walked off the bar leaving me with nobody to refill my drink or give me my check. Another waitress eventually came over and took care of it but she was acting overwhelmed. Bottom line I will eat here for free and put up with the shitty customer service. The food is good so I don't mind having to wait for it. I just have to make sure when I go in that I don't have any other plans for the day, because I practically spend all afternoon there. Also, every time I  have go there I go by myself. I would be embarrassed to take a date to this place because most of the time I go in they treat me like I am not even there. Anyway: Federal Pizza thanks for feeding me for the past couple of months. But seriously WTF is wrong with you people. Don't your servers live on tips? Don't you have to make a profit off of people who come to your restaurant. Like seriously you people need to get your shit together. Then again, I will gladly continue eating at your restaurant for free in return by being ignored by your wait staff. LMAO."}
{"text":"Federal Pizza is one of our favorite restaurants in downtown Phoenix. Service is always good, super friendly staff. You must try the crispy polenta. It's a must every visit.   Everything we've tried has been tasty, but the Casanova Pizza is my all time favorite main on the menu. The only downside is the parking. We've driven downtown a few times and just left to go elsewhere because there is simply nowhere to park on the weekend.   This is a favorite for a girls night out or happy hour, preferably Mon-Thurs. Heads up that it's beer and wine only."}
{"text":"I was excited to go to this place after reading all the great reviews but was super disappointed...  First the ambiance is cute and the waitress was attentive. But the food didn't stack up.   We ordered the arancini (rice balls) and polenta fries for appetizers. The polenta fingers were solid but had too much of the batter around them. The arancini has cilantro inside!  Ewwww. I am a cilantro hater so that was deadly.   For dinner we ordered the meatball pizza and lamb bolognese. The bolognese was super, super gamey and they serve it with the wrong kind of pasta. The sauce doesn't cling well to it so you get blandish pasta and then a pile of sauce next to it. Not tasty.   The pizza was ok but nothing compared to a place like Pizzeria Bianca. Not even the same league.   We were so disappointed we decided to go someplace else for dessert..."}
{"text":"We were greeted friendly enough. Seated at a raised booth right by the Server Station. I thought it was strange that asking us IF we wanted water or not was such a production? I mean, you would think Federal's tap water was from the Fountain of Youth the way it was presented to us with such FLOURISH as if this was a gift from the Gods?! Place was nearly empty save for a couple of tables occupied, a completely empty bar, and some tables outside claimed by families with kids. No reason for more employees than customers in the place to be running around acting like chickens with their heads cut off scrambling erratically about the place like ants on an ant hill? I even asked our server Nancy, what's with all the commotion and the shouting back and forth to each other? I wondered if there was an entire other side of the restaurant I was missing? No. Just keeping up appearances. If they look like they're hustling, then it must be a hip, trendy, fashionable place to dine, right? Wrong. Service was lackluster. Slow. Long intermissions between visiting our table periodically if for no other reason, than to check on things? Prices are outrageous for what you get. Food is meh. Just okay. Nothing to write home to Mom about. I asked for a taste test of two beers which took forever to deliver. Placed our food order, which also took forever on a very slow day, mid-afternoon? Ordered Double-Down half-pizza and wedge salad thinking this was the least expensive thing on the menu at $10.50 for 6 inches. Of pizza. I kid you not. It was 4 pitiful cracker-size triangles of a whole lot of crust, a scant amount of tomato sauce that tasted like Chef Boyardee from a can, and the thinnest possible trace of cheese and exactly ONE (1) pepperoni per triangle. Want fresh Parmesan? OH! This requires a big production too!! Think how special you're going to feel when they shred it over your 6 inches. Of Pizza. For you? How very chic. Tell ya what. I can shake my own parmesan out of a jar. I don't require this. It's just for SHOW! Anticipating a WEDGE salad, (it's in the description folks?! Should be a no-brainer?!) Instead I got what added up to no more than a stalk/rib/root of a head of salad with a whisper of dressing, exactly ONE (1) not TWO, tee-tiny little cherry tomato for a garnish, nary a scant trace of Gorgonzola cubes (I tasted two) and i think there may have been a bacon bit in there somewhere. The lettuce leaf wasn't even enough to serve as a fig leaf. For extra fun, it wasn't served separately or before your pizza, like a first-course? It was placed on a tin pie plate alongside a hot pizza on a thin layer of wax paper. So I had warm salad. I took advantage of...(Or did they take advantage of me for ordering it?), a half-glass of Holly something or other Chardonnay. Of course, this had to be delivered by the bartender who had to demonstrate his talents by pouring my wine for me from a cute little wine decanter to let it breathe first, and then into my glass with such flourish and dramatic interpretation. I have gotten more wine out of a Dixie Cup. To add insult to injury, Nancy never returned to our table until she delivered our food. And then never returned again until it was time to collect the check. I had accidentally dropped a knife on the floor, hoping that Nancy would return so I could ask her for another one, to cut my 1 or 2 leafs of bib lettuce from their root stalks which made up most of the so-called \"Wedge\" salad?! But she never did. So, I went without and used a fork. For extra fun, one employee shouted \"HEY\" to another employee right.over.my.shoulder and into my left ear, and the other employee shouted back at him his response at the same or higher volume into my right ear while I was trying to enjoy my morsel of food. I noticed this goes on a lot here. Employees shouting back and forth to each other. I am sure this is by design. It's an ill-attempt of the owner to train his staff into pretending like they are in an authentic Italian Restaurant, where there's a lot of arm-waving, and shouting at the top of one's lungs, to make it seem like the customer is all part of the action!! What a joke! So transparent what they are trying to do here. It's all one big Grand Illusion. ALL THIS FOR $35 for 2 people for lunch. Not including a tip just because I am that generous of a person and don't like to be perceived as a cheapskate. I will never, ever return again. And recommend to anyone who does not consider themselves one of the thousands of Suckers born every minute, to RUN, don't walk away from visiting Federal Pizza. Complete RIP-OFF!!"}
{"text":"A new pizza place in a historic bank building. A Savings and Loan that most likely Charles Keating and the Keating Five put out of business. And to wash down those wood-fired pizzas from Master Baker MJ Coe, small-batch craft beers, custom growlers and fine wine.  It is the work of restaurateurs Craig DeMarco, wife Kris DeMarco, and Lauren and Wyatt Bailey in business as Federal Pizza, Postino and Windsor & Churn.  Here's what we know.  Located in the historic Al Beadle building, which originally housed the First Federal Savings & Loan Bank, which inspired the restaurant's name, Federal Pizza will serve up sharable starters, salads, sandwiches and wood-fired pizzas.  Federal will offer a seasonal and progressive wine list, small-batch craft beer selections, and custom growlers for to-go orders. Keep in mind you can order a pizza at home, drive through, grab the pizza and fill up your growler of two sizes and drive away without anyone seeing you in your supersexy PJ's. A first in Phoenix. Expect this feature in December.  Today I had a chat with Robert and Megan. Two hard working and very pleseant hotties behind the bar. I ordered up a pitcher of Lost Abbey Ale. The signature of this beer has it's beginnings in the Garden of Eden. Those two were told don't drink it. But Adam got her drunk, and well, you know history.  For my sandwich, Porchetta. On a scale of one to ten this sandwich is a $10. and for lunch, this was a delicious meal. I purchased a 64 growler of Lost Abbey for $10 and Five for the Jug.   Everywhere we turn these days, there is a battle being waged between those who make restaurant love and those who make war. I bless thee."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Came here with my wife to get a free pizza and we were both pleasantly surprised.  The food was very good, as was the alcohol selection.  Started with an order of the roasted veggie board.  It was huge, and it was very good.  A little short on the romesco that comes with it, but small complaint when the veggies were kept large and roasted perfectly.  Also ordered the Caesar.  A good Caesar, and their dressing is more garlicky (as advertised) which we appreciated.  Finally, ordered the Big Star pizza.  Schreiner's sausage, pepperoni, bell pepper, mushrooms, olives, and onions.  It is a very good pizza.  Crust had some flavor, though not all blistered with dark bits.  But it has good crunch with an interior chew.  The toppings all tasted great, but all put together, tasted a little muddled?  Apart from being just a tad over-greasy (I get it, it's a pizza), the balance was a little lost compared to the truly great pizzas we've had.    Still, a very good pizza and a welcome addition to the nationally underrated Valley pizza scene.    Come for the pizza, stay for the booze and veggie board.  Too many other 5-star pizza joints out there in the States, can't give these guys 5 stars."}
{"text":"I waited 45 minutes for a table here on a Friday night and it was so worth it!   I had one of the best pasta dishes I've had in a while. I ordered the Garganelli and added chicken to it. The lemon basil pesto was absolutely heavenly! I usually dont like creamy pastas because most Italian places overdo the amount of sauce that they include but Federal included just the right amount of sauce on this dish!   I also tried my friend's veggie board which was also very good...especially the cauliflower."}
{"text":"The lightening in this pace is awesome!!! Sitting outside on the patio under the heat lamps made my night. Forgot to take a picture of the really tasty Garganeli pasta!!! I am a pesto fan then when you add lemon and fancy broccoli it tastes even better. The service all around was very outgoing, energetic and quick. Not from Phoenix but would definitely recommend to any one who happens to be in the area. The hubby got the chicken wings with the chef recommend garlic parmesan and I had to refrain from eating his meal also."}
{"text":"We ordered the grilled artichoke that had truffle oil on it as well as the Meatball pizza which were both spectacular! The grilled red onions added a nice sweet touch to the pizza."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch. Was going to go to Churn, but last minute decided we were hungry for some food. We ordered the Margherita and the At Last pizzas. The Marg was good- could've used a bit more basil and little less EVOO. The At Last was...interesting. The basil and lemon zest is what drew me in, but I didn't taste much of it. The corn and broccolini were interesting additions, not bad, but peculiar. Overall, i was not impressed with the At Last. Sounded better than it tasted, sad to say.  They have a pasta dish that I'd love to try. They also have wonderful specials at specific times of day that id love to come back for. The pizza was good, but I've had better...  Oh, how can I forget! We also had the crispy polenta fries. Those were pretty bomb, and the romesco sauce was a perfect pairing.  I'm excited to come back and try more. Love the ambiance, friendly servers, and happy customers."}
{"text":"First time here.  2.5 stars.  Mediocre.   We started off by valeting our car, which is absurd considering there is a giant parking lot available.   Restaurant was decorated appealingly, modern with clean lines and open.  Designed to bring the outdoors indoors.  Lovely.    Seating & Drinks: We were seated right away.  2 adults, 2 children in the 7-10 year old range.  We were promptly attended to; however, the waitress seemed rushed to take our order.  There was no cordialness about her.  Drinks arrived promptly.  I ordered a glass of the Sean Minor Pinot Noir (very good flavor, but I wouldn't say it was worth $12 a glass, considering it's in the less than $20 range (OUCH$$$).  She hurriedly poured a portion and walked off... it was so abrupt and took me back a bit as to what the heck her problem was?  Apps & Dinner: We ordered the Roasted Veg appetizer.  It was perfect.  It was a thing of beauty.  Roasted fennel, baby carrots, fingerling potatoes, broccolini, and cauliflower.  We, kids too, really enjoyed the flavor & freshness of the veggies.    Dinner arrived shortly thereafter. Friend recommended the Casanova & two kids pizzas.  The pizza recommendation was spot on!  Arugula, pecorino cheese both melded together perfectly and the sweetness of the dates offset the peppery taste of the arugula.  Brilliant.  The dough of the pizza was not burnt (I did see several burnt crusts, and I was praying that ours wouldn't turn out that way.)  It came out perfectly golden brown.  Crust was thick, chewy & light all at the same time, best crust I've ever had.  The kids really enjoyed  their little personal pizzas as well.  Good size for the kids... they weren't able to finish the pizza.  This is the part where it really takes a turn for the worse.... we finished our food... plates were cleared by hipster bus boys several times... but still no waitress, my husband even called out to her two times as she was walking by and apparently the music must be way to loud because she ignored him.  Still waiting... and waiting... it gets to the point where it was really uncomfortable and then poof!  She arrives, and says, \"Ready for your check?\"  She never came by the table to check on us, NOR ask if I would like another glass of wine, NOR asked if we would like a dessert.  It was evident that she wanted us out of there.  Great.  So we decided to order dessert...lol.  Right, we got the Bombolino (sp) which is pizza dough fried and dusted in sugar and served with melted dark chocolate dipping sauce.  The dough/sugar combo was FLAVORLESS, even with the chocolate... 3 of the dough balls were RAW inside... I had to open the rest to check to see if they were even edible. The Bombolino was actually so bad, the two sugar loving kids became uninterested in the dessert.  The berry cobbler was really good but nothing to write home about.  Desserts finished... once again, the waitress was nowhere to be found, THANKFULLY, I think it was the manager who stopped by and was very friendly, who we were able to ask for our check and she returned with it promptly.   I would've given this place more stars, but the food couldn't carry this place by itself.  You are serving pizza, you HAVE-TO HAVE-TO HAVE-TO back up your food by GRACIOUS service.  It ruined the experience for us.  As good as the pizza was, it wasn't good enough to really bring us back in the future.   We do still love Postino's.   Last but not least, we went to get our car from valet.  The car was parked in the parking space right next to the valet stand...right.  Thanks for pulling out our car 10 feet so we can get in.  So awkward.  Things they should address:  You cannot tell the staff apart from the patrons.  They should wear something that indicates that they employees.  Do they need a uniform?  No, but they do need something to differentiate them.  They should also fix the parking valet situation when it's not necessary during the evening, it's just plain silly.   Definitely better customer service skills from our waitress, so maybe higher expectations for their employees.  It's a shame that one person can bring a negative atmosphere to a good restaurant."}
{"text":"If there is anything my family takes seriously, it's pizza.  My kids may be two and five but they don't want to chomp on greasy fast-food pizza anymore than the next guy.  Federal is hands-down our favorite restaurant in town.  The menu is amazing.  We haven't ever ordered anything we didn't like.  My kids love the sweet potato and sage and I'm a big fan of the sweeter Casanova.  The brussels sprout is crazy good (even if you're not a regular brussels fan) and so is the Schreiner's sausage.  My husband ordered the chef's choice once--it was a mushroom pizza that was delicious.  The appetizers are also really good, if you're with a crowd.  The staff is really friendly and accommodating--happy to give you the low down on any beers or pizzas that you're curious about."}
{"text":"This was my very first visit to an \"Upward Concepts\" restaurant.  I was very much looking forward to my visit to Federal Pizza due to the numerous recommendations that I'd gotten from friends.  I am quite possibly one of the easiest people in the world to please, which is why it pains me to share my experience.  This visit happened the day before New Years Eve...  We arrived at the restaurant to \"complimentary\" but required valet service.  Why, oh why, do these folks force you to valet your vehicle?  There seems to be ample parking since Aiello's has since gone out of business.  There is nothing more foolish than walking out of a restaurant, handing some kid your claim ticket only to be forced to wait for your car which is well within spitting distance.  SUGGESTION: Let me park my own car... \"complimentary\" but required valet service does not equate added value.  We were well prepared for a lengthy wait.  After all, this place just opened up a few short months ago and seems to be the \"it\" place.  PROPS: They had beverage service available while you wait!!  Once we were seated, my attention was immediately drawn to the table of animals that had been dining for some time.  I don't often use the term \"animals\" to refer to a table full of children, but stick with me as I think you'll agree.  Picture it... five parents enjoying beer and wine while the five children were seated at the opposite end of the table left to terrorize the patrons.  We're talking feet on the table, banging on the windows, slapping/punching each other and yelling just to name a few of the behaviors.  It must have been some pretty good beer/wine because the parents opted to allow it all to continue.  Enter the owners of Federal... they approach the table and are introduced to some of the folks dining.  They have a friendly exchange and walk off.  Never addressing the out of control children!  SUGGESTION: It's ok to approach someone and tell them they need to monitor their children... after all what's the worst that will happen?  You lose them as a customer?  I'd rather lose them as a customer versus all the people that had to put up with the parents' negligence.  Somewhere in between the screaming children and the hostess that seemed to yawn non-stop we managed to get our order in: Porchetta Sandwich (as an appetizer), Cesar salad (as an appetizer), Pepperoni Pizza and a Big Star Pizza (asked for the pizza to be \"crispy\").  When the food was finally delivered the Porchetta Sandwich was flavorless and mostly mouthfuls of pork fat.  The cesar salad seemed to have way more than it's fair share of anchiove.  It was so fishy that it was inedible.  SUGGESTION: Taste your food.  The pizzas came to the table burnt beyond recognition on half the pizza... a clear indication that they were not turned (as any good wood fired pizza is) in the oven.  We asked to give some feedback to the manager.  I will not use her name but will tell you that she was a young attractive blonde.  Clearly our server had taken it upon himself to tell her that we asked for our pizzas to be WELL DONE, which if you'll recall from earlier we said \"crispy\".  She proceeded to make an attempt at telling us in her own polite way that it was our fault because we ordered them well done.  After I made it known that I was onto her and her tone, she truly seemed to be interested in getting some good feedback from us.  After chatting she offered to comp our entire meal.  It was VERY NICE of her to offer to do that!!  If you are reading this... thanks for turning the conversation around and creating a more pleasant tone, it was appreciated.  We will give it a second chance for sure... here's to hoping that visit turns out better than this one!"}
{"text":"Went here on a recent trip to Phoenix and truly enjoyed the food and service.    Loved the margherita pizza and caesar  salad. We also got a tiramisu to go and it was SUBLIME!!  We will definitely return when in the area."}
{"text":"Federal Pizza is AMAZING. I have been here on two occasions--once with my boyfriend, and once with my family--and both experiences were out of this world. Being from NYC, I'm hard to please when it comes to pizza...and this place definitely exceeds my expectations. My favorite: the Casanova Pizza (prosciutto, dates, ricotta, augula, and pecorino). Needless to say, it's sweet and salty perfection. The decor is retro trendy. If you're into antiques, check out the beautiful lamps from the 50's, 60's and 70's.   Overall, everything about FP is five stars. If you have a Yelp list like I do, this should be at the very top.  Oh, and they have Drive Thru Take Out...just call ahead!"}
{"text":"I wasn't in a pizza mood, so I got the mushroom ravioli.  It was pretty tasty.  My brother-in-law's wife ended up getting some pizza and let me try some of her's.  I wasn't disappointed.  Mmmmm....  The decor of the place is nice as well."}
{"text":"A place out of this world. Great Ambiance & food, all the food is to die for & you will. Coffee is freshly roasted from the local Cult Coffee Roasters.  Once you are in, you will not leave, especially when you are served by Kyle & Nancy they are awesome, they bring in Crowds. Not a place for Kids"}
{"text":"I love this place   I am not a huge pizza eater. But they make wonderful woodstove pizzas. The Big Star is One of my favorites. I love the brussels sprout appetizer. And if you get there before 5 PM a picture of beer is only five dollars."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great salads! The best lunch deal for $10 -- half a pizza and salad! Perfect! We had the spring salad and federal chop salad. They were both phenomenal. The pizza crust is a little salty and the sauce is a little sweet, so it's the perfect combination. We had the meatball and the manifesto pizzas and they were both amazing.   The only problem with this place is the LOUD MUSIC! I read this on a review before we went and I definitely agree. We took our dad and it made for some difficult conversation. I think he will never go back. I will go back because the food is awesome--but I hope they have the volume turned down a notch by then."}
{"text":"Federal Pizza, what do I love about it? Well for one, the service. Out of 4x I've been only once was the service sub par, must've been someone new. The food is fantastic, excellent pastas and pizzas. My fave pizza is the margarita but I do wish it had tomato sauce on it as well because it kinda tastes like just bread and cheese otherwise. This is just personal preference of course, it's still a good pizza. For dessert I've tried 2 of their cobblers, a mixed berry and a peach. Both cobblers were fantastical! OMG, I wish they always had cobbler but I hear it's seasonal so they may be changing things up again soon. They have a great selection of craft beers and in different sizes too! Overall, one of my fave go to restaurants in Phoenix. Oh and I almost forgot, for appetizer you must try their polenta fries, just do it!"}
{"text":"Well, coming from a die hard right wing Trump voter... if you can get past the trendy hipster Mecca decor, this place has the best Pizza in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Love it! Great food. Attentive service. I like how rather than assign one waiter to your table, there's a team of people, any of whom can help. They messed up our appetizer order so we got two appetizers free  Sign up for the emails!"}
{"text":"I've heard good and bad things about the service as well as the pizza however I have to say that I have been there 3 times now and every single time the service was awesome, the pizza was awesome, the salads were awesome and the environment and vibe was incredibly awesome!!! This is for sure one of my new staples in downtown Phoenix!! Thanks guys."}
{"text":"I don't like pizza.  I have no idea why I thought it was a good idea to go to this place, but it was new and we LOVE Windsor and Churn and Postino, so...here we go...  Holy COW was I in heaven.  I LOVED this place. The architecture and the nice touches with decor and charm. I was so comfortable.  The server was awesome, and the wine was really good. GREAT choices and you can carry out wine too!  The food was simply amazing. Hands down better than any other place I have eaten in a while. I couldn't believe the Pizza!  Amazing. My salad was awesome, and the brussel sprouts are outstanding.  My son had the dessert and it was so cool...they made a pudding type s'more thing...I am not going to be able to do it justice!!  I can't wait to go back again. I am dreaming about the clever pizza toppings and eager to try something new.  Thank you for changing my life. I love Federal Pizza!  P.S. My birthday was two weeks ago and I didn't get a birthday e-mail.  So sad."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in town and it's walking distance from my apartment, which is a huge plus.  Food and service is consistently on point. I had always come for the pizza but recently ventured out and tried their salads and sandwiches. Crazy, I know. Everything I have tried was delicious. Never a complaint, and never wished I had ordered something else instead. They make their own wine coolers which are fun and tasty (and quite a bit stronger than the B&J crap you get at the grocery store. Its just a fun, hip restaurant with friendly staff and laid back atmosphere and I look forward to every visit here. In fact I have reservations for 10 for my birthday tonight!"}
{"text":"Perfecto! I truly love the pizza here.  The food is amazing and never disappoints.  I had dinner with a friend last night and was pretty busy for a Wednesday.  We sat at the bar since it was too hot to enjoy the patio.  We split the 4 Cheese Pizza with a cheese blend and sauce.  So yummy and I love the thin crust.  I ordered the Great Little Salad and even ate the beets.  I have tried the Margherita Pizza and Caeser is a great combination.   I recommend the Mister Mister as an appetizer.  Lightly fried veggies and mozzarella with delicious Green Goddess.  The Blackberry Rosemary Wine Cooler is great on any day.  The staff are amazing and very attentive. I will have to try the Sweet Potato or Casanova pizza on my next visit."}
{"text":"Pizza was good but not amazing like other places. The meatballs appetizer was really good as the sauce complimented the seasoned meatballs well. The location is good, the staff is friendly and efficient, and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times now and the service and food is always amazing!  Parking in the area has a bit to be desired but there's many restaurants that I've been to where it is like that.  The atmosphere at night time is particularly great, candle lit and all of the bartenders have been amazing!  If you've never been here this place is one to put on your to do list!  I had a ravioli dish that was to die for, I'm pretty sure all of their pastas are made in house.  I like the trendy appeal this place has to offer!  Job well done Federal Pizza!"}
{"text":"We visited Federal Pizza a week after it opened to give the crowds a bit to die down (of course they never do). The interior is charming, as with all of the Upward Project restaurant designs. We are very excited to have another wonderful neighborhood restaurant.   Drive through lane: If you call in your order, you can pull in to pick it up via the drive through lane. Very happy with this, as you don't have to get out of your car (like at Postino's), given it is a majority valet parking.   Staff: Staff is awesome and friendly.  Pizza: To date, we have tried the Big Star Pizza (a family favorite); Also one with prosciutto and dates (my personal favorite); and one with meatballs (our least favorite). Pizza dough was a tad doughy, otherwise it is fantastic.  Dessert: Must try the chocolate mouse with the oreo crust and home made marshmellows on top. My only complaint is that they can't make it up to go via drive through :("}
{"text":"I really like Federal Pizza. They always play great music and have a fun atmosphere. The service is great but the star of the show is their food. Any place that has homemade pasta holds a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"Dishes sampled include:  Raspberry Lavender Wine Cooler Grapefruit Ginger Wine Cooler Corn coins with Fennel, Herbs, Pecorino Beets with Pears and Pecorino Polenta with Romesco Burrata with Olive Oil, Sea Salt, Crostini Margherita with House Mozzarella, Roasted Tomato, Basil, Olive Oil - Half Artichoke Hearts Casanova with Prosciutto, Dates, Ricotta, Arugula, Pecorino Bombolini with Chocolate Dip  From the team behind Postino featuring crusts crafted by local bread legend MJ Coe Federal Pizza seemed like a great choice for lunch after visiting the Desert Botanical Gardens and with the new restaurant clearly fresh on the minds of locals I was not surprised by the proposed thirty minute wait on our arrival; what I was surprised by, however, was how poorly the restaurant flowed after we were finally seated nearly an hour later on the outdoor patio - even taking into account 'growing pains' the service needed work, our waiter John forgetting about us (and part of our order) leaving us with empty water glasses more than once while sitting in the sun and a nearly forty minute gap between appetizers and pizzas.  Subpar service aside, once the food began to arrive at Federal we were met with a somewhat mixed bag as the appetizers, including the oft raved 'corn coins' and a bright, bold, and balanced salad of various beets proved far superior to the pies - particularly the doughy, limp, and undercooked Margherita.  Faring better, both in terms of ingredients and texture, I will admit that the Casanova was a good pizza with great chew and top quality ingredients, but for two pizzas on the exact same day to be so wildly inconsistent certainly gives me pause when considering a recommendation of Federal Pizza, let alone a return visit...not in a city where far better pizza can be found in abundance.  A nice space for drinks, appetizers, and even desserts perhaps I'll give Federal Pizza a second chance at some point, but with Pizzeria Bianco, 'Pomo, The Parlor, and La Grande Orange all turning out a superior product there is no chance I'd wait in line to do so."}
{"text":"Always friendly and timely service. Even order for pick up time to time. Yummy! Glass of white wine or a bottle to go. Place is always alive and parking can get crazy but somehow there is always a spot for everyone, yum!"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE pizza in town!!  The variety is interesting and yummy..THE BEST!! We usually call in our order and pick up at the convenient drive up window."}
{"text":"There are pizza joints and there is Federal Pizza. In America pizza is a common food so when I find a place that offers non-tradition type pizzas I consider them awesome. I can't think of enough ways to state how superbly amazing every pizza has been.    Federal Pizza does have your typical supreme or meat pizza but they include additional toppings that will make you go Pavlovian while waiting for the food to arrive.  Some friends invited me there for my second trip to this wonderland recently and again I wasn't disappointed.  Having never before eaten brussel sprouts I was a bit skeptical when my dining companions ordered a pizza with brussel sprouts,pancetta and other amazing toppings.  The first bite was heavenly the combination of favors were exceptional. The crust was just thin enough to not overpower the main event.  I have to thanks my friends for making My first experience with brussel sprouts an outstanding one!  Our second pizza was both visually stunning as well as mouth watering yumminess. The colorful combination of yellow and red peppers offered a nice visual contrast to the mushrooms and onions.  The flavors of the vegetables perfectly complimented the meat topping that accompanied it. While I did pick the mushrooms off because I am not a fan the pizza still was astronomical.   To start the evening we enjoyed a flavor explosion found in the chop salad.  Just the right amount of spring greens, cheese, and salami, not to mention the peppercinis.  Just a hint of salad dressing to top the masterpiece, definitely not overpowering or drenching.    A fun feature to this restaurant is the drive through option. You can place an order to go and pick up a couple of bottles of wine while your at it. Not something you see in your average pizzeria..  The service was phenomenal, I don't believe my water glass was ever completely empty.  The servers were very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been to Federal Pizza twice now. The first time was a great experience, I went with a group of 6 friends for dinner on a Saturday night. It was pretty busy, but we were seated reasonably quickly. We shared a few pizzas and pitchers and everyone had a great time.   My second visit, a few weeks ago, is what made me want to write this review. This time it was just my boyfriend and myself for dinner on a week night. I ordered the veggie lasagna. It wasn't an unusual amount of time before our food came out, and everything looked and tasted spectacular. The manager came to our table to ask how everything was, and apologized for what he said was a long wait for our food. He told us that they make a point to get the food out within a specific time frame. The lasagna is a new menu item, and because it is thick, he said they were still working on getting it out within their goal time. He told us that he would take the lasagna off of our bill.  We were so impressed that he went above and beyond to fix something that we didn't even think was a problem. The service and food are great, and the whole place looks amazing. We look forward to returning again and again."}
{"text":"I am a big Upward Projects fan. Love love love Postinos. And I really love what they are doing with the older buildings on Central. Federal Pizza is in an old bank building (by Al Beadle), with a really nice open layout, big windows, a nice patio out front, retro decor - every table had different salt & pepper shakers & there are different mid-century lights around the building. And the kitchen is open with the oven right out there in view. Loved the decor.   I went with friends from work for lunch the other day, (maybe a week after they opened) and then with another friend from out of town & my husband last night.  The food was fabulous each time!  Loved the wood-fired pizza. The dough is great - chewy and crisp all at once (cudos to Michael Coe) - probably the second best in town. Better than Bianco's & better than the Parlor. Maybe not quite as good as, but very very close to Grazies. I've had the Manifesto (with Schriners sausage), the Casanova (with arugula, dates & prosciutto) and the Big Star Pizza (Schriners Sausage, red & Yellow peppers, roasted onions, etc.). They were all great.   We also had the Corn Coins (both times!) - roasted corn with cheese, herbs & salt - cut into little coins that are great to munch on.  We also had the baratta & bread, which was good...but I think they could have added some kind of little tid-bit to go with it as baratta is good, but best when you have something else spicy/sweet/savory to put a dab on it with the bread.   We also had the wedge salad last night - and it was great. Very flavorful, nice fresh lettuce, crispy bacon, etc. We loved it. Next time I'll order my own rather than sharing...it was that good.  I was particularly excited to try their \"wine coolers\"...but don't even think about the bottles sweet wine cooler things in the grocery store. I had the Grapefruit & ginger wine cooler, and it was spectacular. I loved it. So fresh & flavorful and just a tiny bit sweet.   Service was great both times - our waiter at lunch was incredibly helpful and made great suggestions.  I can't wait to go back for Happy Hour - they have the 5$ before 5 deal just like Postinos.   Great new restaurant - go try it!"}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday afternoon with some girlfriends, we had a great time and I'm looking forward to returning! The décor/atmosphere is open and roomy, which is a nice change from Postino's, where I feel a bit claustrophobic when it's crowded.  It took a while for our server to get our drink order even though there were several of them standing around talking in the corner.  But after that, things were smooth.  The servers seem like they think they're a little 'too cool for school', but they were young and friendly so whatever.  The drink menu is great, a nice variety of wines, beers, and my friends loved the wine coolers.  I bought a growler to bring home for my husband, so that is a cool perk.  We had the buratta/crostini app which was delicious!  Cheese and bread,  yum!  The cheese was so smooth and delish!  I split a Caesar salad with my friend and that was just okay, wouldn't order that again.  We each got pizzas, they're around 12 inches, good for 1-2 people depending on how hungry you are.  I stayed simple and ordered the pepperoni.  I loved the chewy, crispy crust that was cooked well done just how I like it! Just the right amount of cheese and sauce.  I'm craving more as I write!  My friends ordered some of the more eclectic pizzas and we were all happy with the results.  I recommend!  A great place for happy hour, date night, or girls day/night out!"}
{"text":"Yummy, fresh and even healthy items to choose from. Surprising combinations that you wouldn't think to put on a pizza, but omgosh the date, prosciutto,  ricotta, and arugula pizza is heavenly. Music inside gave it a nice vibe, patio seating outside, friendly service. Oh and the wine coolers are super refreshing, I had the grapefruit ginger wine cooler it was the perfect hit of ginger, not over powering at all the grapefruit was very subtle. The grilled veggie board is a deffinate hit. I seriously can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Decided to try while downtown on a Saturday. The reviews matched my experience.  Awesome awesome and awesome.......great food great service!  The meatball sandwich was superb. The CAESAR salad was yummy.  We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Another awesome place in central Phoenix. Loved the pizza. Great drink selection too. Yummy lunch specials and even happy hour pricing - great for our girls lunches."}
{"text":"This update does not pertain to the service staff directly or even the overall food (as you can see from my previous review).  This update is solely based on the behavior of the owners.  My girlfriend and I had a bad experience here over the summer (aka food poisoning).  You can view the whole story under the review from Mackenzie F.  To this date, nothing ever came about from the owners.  At no point were we ever trying to \"get\" anything from them or anyone else.  We simply wanted to ensure it wouldn't happen to others.  We just wanted a chance to voice our concerns and be assured that steps would be taken internally to correct any issues.  I have been in the service industry for many years at various levels and I cannot believe that an owner would simply not care if one of their patrons ended up at the hospital.  I am a realist and I understand that the specific food issue could have come from anywhere in the supply chain right up to the preparation stage.  But to completely ignore an issue like this is unacceptable.  We will not be frequenting any of the Upward Projects businesses going forward."}
{"text":"Great Central Ave corridor location. Modern, trendy location and ambience,good service. Parking is messy, plan to valet.   The pepperoni pizza we ordered wasn't anything super amazing and appetizers were overall, just okay..  We ordered the fried risotto balls and meatballs to start..Risotto balls lacked flavor, needed cheese or something additional. Meatballs app was pretty tasty, however.  The pizza wasn't anything horrible (I ate the leftovers the next day)  but certainly wasn't anything super special.   Probably not wrote the 45 minute wait on a Friday night that we waited but decent spot. Won't be returning anytime super soon but glad we got to try this spot out."}
{"text":"My ALL-TIME favorite pizza! Every time I come in I receive not only the best service but the best pizza. The team is extremely friendly and courteous- all servers are very knowledgeable about the food and even make recommendations! They also have a large variety of beer and wine options and the best wine coolers. Hands down, the best pizza spot in town."}
{"text":"I was very satisfied with the service and food here. The server we had was very attentive and offered his personal recommendations. The wine coolers were okay, but it's not my thing. My girlfriend enjoyed them.   The pizza was great, not over or undercooked. It's made whatever way you want beyond their suggested toppings.   I'd recommend going there in off-peak hours. I didn't have to wait and the noise level was lower so one could have a conversation.   What gives this place five stars? Food and the service. Try it!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have not given Federal Pizza a rating yet.... Here we go....  I love this place.  It is gourmet pizza, so you pay for what you get but the quality is very high.  I have had about every pizza they offer and all are great!  I feel the Big Star will appease anyone but there are also some pizzas that are very unique and mix a variety of ingredients.  The salads are filling and awesome!  What I like the most is the service - one time we received a pizza where there was a hole in the middle and the issue was addressed and we were comped for the mistake.  Lastly, Federal Pizza offers a great beer selection and you can't beat the happy hour pricing - $5 small pitchers.  If there is one flaw, its the happy hour times - it only goes until 5pm. I wish the happy hour went till 6 or 7.  Its also great for families and kids.  Keep it up Federal! Love ya!"}
{"text":"Finally got to go here and I was not disappointed! We went last night, a Friday night, around 6:30 and didn't have to wait too long. There was a cocktail server that brought us drinks within a few minutes Waiting gave us time to look over the menu as well.   There were three of us and we decided to do an appetizer and two pizzas. For our app we got the burrata, recommended by our server. It was good, nothing amazing, but good. It was a little bland for me, so I added the basil garnish which gave it a little something of what it was lacking. And for pizzas we got the Big Star and the Chef's Whim. Both were absolutely amazing and I don't think I could pick a favorite. The Big Star has Schreiner's sausage, Molinari pepperoni, red and yellow bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, and wood roasted onions. Everything on the pizza was great, even the olives were tolerable and I hate olives. Probably some of the best pepperoni I have ever had. The Chef's Whim that night had sauteed shrimp, sweet yellow corn, asparagus, peppers (some kind of small, sweet red peppers), lemon zest, cheese blend and instead of red sauce it was a roasted garlic sauce. I was surprised at how amazing this pizza was!   I'm not sure what people are talking about when they say bad service because our service was on point. Our beer and wine came out within a couple minutes during our entire meal. Our waters were topped off by at least four servers, plates were cleared right after finishing, and box and check came out right after we asked. We had an awesome experience and we will definitely be going back soon! We will also be taking advantage of their drive thru option :)"}
{"text":"It was already 9 pm on a Sunday night.  Just yelped for a pizza place and found this place that I'd never heard of before. The name didn't sound anything special. So, our expectation was nothing more than a average Joe's pizza.  When we entered found it quite elegant looking with a nice mellow music. Ali, our server, was most accommodative. Although it was only 45 minutes to close, she never hurried or pushed us for placing a quick order. She took time to explain the menu and even moved us to another table when the one we're sitting at was getting too much of a chilly breeze.   My children ordered Veggie Lasagna.  Picked \"Sweet Potato pizza\" for my in-laws and \"At Last\" for us. I also requested a side salad called \"Great Little Salad\" and a glass of Four Peaks Sunbru for myself.  Food was served in less than 20 minutes. Children thought it was the best Lasagna they ever had! My in-laws, who never really enjoy the pizza just loved the texture and taste of their brick oven baked pizza with Sweet potato topping and light sprinkles of Ricotta cheese.  \"At Last\" pizza was superb with basil and sage toppings nicely arranged over fine goat cheese.My side salad was so fresh and crunchy that I promised myself to get a full plate next time!  This place gives you a fine dining experience at a real average price.  Being a frugal foodie I just love it."}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place and finally went with some friends! They were really busy on a Sunday night so we sat outside to sit faster. I would recommend sitting inside unless it's a nice day out, because I felt like we lost a lot of the atmosphere.     The food was incredible! We got 3 pizzas and shared them(and also took home lots of leftovers). The sweet potato pizza and the prosciutto pizza were the best and I would highly recommend them!! The service was really attentive even though they were clearly very busy and the price seemed to match the quality!"}
{"text":"As a long time fan of Postino and Windsor, when my best foodie friend sent me a reminder about the opening of Federal Pizza, we promptly scheduled our next Girls' Night for dinner there.  We had a bit of a wait, but there was adequate seating by the parking area, so it wasn't a big deal.  We were shown to our table on the patio to enjoy the wonderful October weather.  We decided to split a pitcher of Pilsner Urquell (although they have many great choices, including cans of Big Sky Moose Drool) and the burrata appetizer.  Our waitress was sweet and checked on us regularly without seeming pushy.  The pitcher soon arrived, quickly followed by the burrata.  The grilled bread had a great charred flavor and a soft interior, it was probably our favorite part of the dish.  Although the burrata had a great texture and was definitely fresh, we felt it could have benefitted from a bit of a flavor boost, such as a hit of lemon zest, some basil or a nice spicy Calabrian style chili olive oil.  The menu states the burrata comes with olive oil and sea salt, but for some reason, these taste elements seemed to be missing from our portion.  Overall a B for this appetizer.  The quality of the ingredients was definitely there, but the flavor profile was just a bit MEH.  After a few minutes, our waitress stopped by to see if we were ready to proceed with ordering more food.  We were, and asked to share the wedge salad and the brussels sprout pizza.  There was a bit of confusion, I probably didn't specify the brussels sprout  pizza, so the waitress put in our order for the brussels sprout side dish.  Our wedge salad arrived, the kitchen was kind enough to split the salad to ensure we each got our share of all the tasty gorgonzola, dates and Schreiner's bacon.  The salad nicely hit all the flavors, with very fresh lettuce and ripe cherry tomatoes to boot.  Then, another server brought our brussels sprout side dish.  OOPS.... no big deal, we clarified we had wanted the brussels sprout pizza.  They were quick to rectify this tiny mistake, with a manager stopping by to let us know the pizza was on them for the error.  Wow, that's the kind of service we know and love from all the Uptown Projects restaurants!  Completely unnecessary to comp the pizza for the confusion, but a very nice touch and greatly appreciated.  The pizza arrived a few minutes later.  The crust was completely different than other popular Phoenix area thin crust wood-fired pizza havens, not the best, but definitely not the worst.  The toppings were what put this pizza over the top for both of us.  We are both huge fans of brussels sprouts, especially when they are roasted and crispy.  Add salty pancetta bits, some garlic love, melty manchego cheese and top it all off with some lemon zest to brighten the whole flavor profile, and this pizza is definitely a winner.  I wish I could give 4 1/2 stars, as Federal is better than a 4 star, but not quite to the perfection of a 5 star.  I will definitely visit again and try some of the other interesting sounding pizza combos on their menu."}
{"text":"To be honest I just love having reasons to hang out in uptown phoenix, and I'll take any excuse to enjoy some comfort food style pizza.   Federal takes that artisan style craft pizza inspired by Bianco & removes all of the unnecessary fuss that isnt needed when youre having PIZZA.   There always a fun and adventurous array of toppings & the starters usually change so you can enjoy a nice change of pace for each visit.   Staff is decent, they tip share so the urgency is lacking & your server/bartender will go missing quite often.  Pricing of food & most drinks is fantastic.  The beer selection is above average, lots of same ol same ol that is already sold all over the valley.  Wine selection usually has at least something palatable, but their list is focused more on the price point crowd & not the enthusiast.   Girls bring a sweater, the AC is always blasting in here.   Bottom line, this is some of the best pizza in the valley & it would be awesome if they were open late."}
{"text":"OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! This was our first time eating here and we were not let down. Service and food were superior. I had a fresh grapefruit ginger wine cooler OMG fantastic. We will be back and soon!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic dinner tonight.  Last minute decision to quench a pizza craving with my daughter. She wanted buffalo wings which are usually to spicy for me but I asked what the \"chefs choice\" wings were.  I was told sweet chili and the waiter offered to split the order with both flavors.  Great offer and great outcome.  Sweet chili wings are awesome!   Who knew?  Then we wanted pizza but each wanted a different one.  Again the waiter said we could split one and do different flavors.  The Manifesto add corn was delicious and the Casanova was equally great!   Great flavors and really good crust.  Add that this was on a lovely patio with excellent service and we both felt we had a great meal."}
{"text":"Perfect business lunch spot.  I am not sure how they get the crust to bubble like that but it is perfection.  The salads are light and unique.  Must try this place if you haven't."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty. Excellent job on pairing the brew to the pie! Friendly service. Candidly I think they are a bit pricey for the quantity though the quality is up there."}
{"text":"We went to see my moms Aunt Irene today, but before we did, we decided to grab some lunch here at Federal Pizza.  I had signed up for their email club a few weeks ago and one of the perks of joining is a free pizza!  Score!  When I first walked through the doors, I thought they weren't going to let me in.  I didn't have any facial hair, tattoos, a cool hair style, nice clothes and the fact that I arrived in a car instead of a fixie bike, exposed me even more.  (If you didn't know already, I'm not the biggest fan of hipsters...anyways...this is home base for them).  The hostess was super nice though and showed me and my mom to a booth in the center of the joint.  I ordered a Coke and we showed our waitress my free pizza email on my phone.  She wrote down some number and that was that.  We ordered a pepperoni pizza and a meatball sandwich to split.  About 10 minutes later, our food had arrived.  Here is how it was.......................  Pepperoni Pizza ($12.00 normally but free with email club signup) -  Simple and delicious.  As per the menu description, \"Molinari Pepperoni + Federal Cheese Blend + Red Sauce\".  The pizza was a little bit \"wet\".  Just a tad soggy in the middle.  You could still pick it up and fold it if you were careful, but it was pretty droopy.  The pepperoni was in large slices and tasted awesome.  I really dug their \"cheese blend\" too.  It was delicious.  Nice and creamy and very flavorful.  The dough/crust  tasted fine except that it was a little bit too soft for my liking.  It was pretty \"bready\".  Overall it was a good, but not great pizza.  Can't complain about a free pizza though.  Would I come back and buy this pizza?  Probably,  but if I am driving somewhere for pizza, there are a few other places I would head to first.  Meatball Sandwich ($10.00) -  This thing was delicious!  As per the menu description, \"Three Meatballs + House Mozz + Pomodoro + Basil + Wood Roasted Onions\".  I really liked this sandwich.  The meatballs were tender, the sauce was delicious, the cheese was melted nicely and the wood fired onions gave it a great \"bite\".  The bread they use is fantastic too.  Not sure if it is their pizza dough or not but whatever it is, it was great.  It was nice and toasty and held together well.  It was served with a little side salad too.  I didn't touch that because I am allergic to vegetables, but I would definitely get this sandwich again.  Service was really friendly.  They weren't around much but they had smiles on their faces and brought me a drink refill without having to ask for it which was cool.    Not sure if I will seek this place out again, but the sandwich was great and the pizza was pretty good.  If I was with some hipster buddies...wait...I don't have any hipster buddies......but if I did, and they wanted to come here, I would probably accompany them and get something to eat."}
{"text":"Super yummy and fresh pizza and good service!   Parking: this I a tough lot because it is shared with the crackin joyride next to it. We found a space by luck right out in front.   Service: our waiter was kind and helpful and came back multiple times when we weren't ready. They were really into keeping out water filled lol. Like take a sip and get a full quick lol. The place is cute and cozy. A def adult pizza joint with a good liquor menu and even better pizza  Pizza: we got three pizzas the equivalent to Hawaiian, meatball pizza, and combo pizza equivalent. My fav was the Hawaiian. It had piña and meat and was sweet and salty as it should be. We also had the polenta to share and I thought it was really good. It came with a sauce that was so yummy! I wanted a side of that to dip my pizza into. So if you go ask for that sauce!! The polenta was yummy and fried.   I would go again for that sauce that came with the polenta."}
{"text":"From the Big Star to the Casanova, Federal pizza is not f*ckin' around.  Crust: perfectly thin and crispy. Toppings: top-notch and distributed evenly. Cheese: a solid reason to get up in the morning.   Overall: bring it all on, 'cause I'm going to finish it before I roll outta this biznitch. Leftovers are for the weak when you're dealing with pizza this rightfully grandiose."}
{"text":"Live love love the polenta sticks. Pizza is also great. The staff is some of the nicest I seen."}
{"text":"Amzing, food, service & enviornment. Perfect for a date night.  You can't go wrong with any of their food choices. Food is reasonably priced. Our server for the night was a cool guy named Jet. He is Laid back guy, funny & recomended some great choices. Next time I am Phoenix this will be my go to place."}
{"text":"Been here so many times and the food and service it's always amazing!one of my favorite is the star pizza with the Sierra Nevada Beer !be back very soon !!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!!  Great pizza, cool place and nice people. Convenient covered parking. Pizzas only one size but perfect for two, or order two different pies to share and take some goodness home."}
{"text":"The pizza dough is made by scratch and is local, thanks to MJ Bakery. It has the perfect crunch/doughy ratio and is light yet flavorful.   The Meatball pizza is delicious and definitely one that I can't seem to stop ordering. The meatballs are sliced thinly and are reminiscent of meatloaf -- rich, hearty and well seasoned. I personally like to add ricotta, just my thing. Though beware, it tends to make the crust slightly soggy (I don't mind).  If you're in the mood to make a mess, order the grilled artichoke, I swear it's worth the price.  So happy that I can walk here from my house.  The servers are super friendly and not too pretentiously hipster.  I do with they served cocktails..."}
{"text":"Friday night, the wife was out of town. I settled upon Federal Pizza as our reliable standby, Spinato's, is not up to par in their new location--even for takeout.  I called in an order for the Brussels Sprout pizza. At 7:45 the order taker said it would be ready at 8:15. I was starving but figured I'd live. And figured with their, highly touted, super-duper takeout drivethrough (an old bank teller window or somesuch), my dwell time for pickup would be optimized. Boy, was I wrong.   I arrived precisely at 8:15--not because I am neurotic but because we happen to live about 120 seconds from the restaurant. I was second in line. I figured that was ok because, if there is a bit of inaccuracy in their scheduling, I would be sure to have to wait no longer than it took me to get to the window.   As it turns out, the server walked down the line to see who was there. She took my name and returned in a couple of minutes to say that my pizza was \"not quite ready yet\". Bad sign. Well, I moved up to first place and was able to observe a restaurant that did not seem particularly crowded (as many of the Upward Project sycophants have gravitated to the adjacent Joyride which, by-the-way, means a \"stolen\" ride. But that's another story).  I was able to partly pass the time taking care of as paying and tipping (in advance of delivery which, observed after the fact, should have raised a bit of hair on the back of my neck).  Perched at the drive-through door, I was subjected to a roller coaster of hunger pangs as servers kept scurrying around with mine repeatedly going back to the kitchen to check on my pie. My concern growing by the moment as she repeatedly returned empty handed. I think to myself (mind you it is almost 10 minutes late now. They must not have even started my pizza until I arrived): \"What is going on here? Are things so out of control in this dedicated pizza restaurant that they can't control their production line?\" But I assuaged myself that, with one of those fancy 700 degree pizza ovens (after all, Pizzeria Bianco can fully cook 12\" pizzas in 10 minutes) that mine would be just fine. Wrong.  My server finally arrived with the box and proudly thrust it into my hands with a selfsame look of satisfaction. Probably a look borne of being glad to see me finally go than than being proud that Federal Pizza has served another valued customer a work of art.  I should have realized, the moment the box hit my hand, that something was terribly wrong. But I though to myself (justified I guess) that the box was barely warm because the pizza had not been in it long enough to warm it. That the server had grabbed it so quickly in her zeal to sate my hunger that the heat had not penetrated the carton. As I sped off into the dark with visions of enjoying a Doc Martin episode with my near stellar pizza (with plate in preheated oven) at 8:30.  Arrived home, cracked a nice cold beer, and opened the box. Lo. It was barely cooked. The crust was pale and sallow. The ingredients barely lukewarm. The parmesan shaving not even wilted. This presentation spoke volumes. The brussels sprouts were cooked, but not hot. This exposed the fact that the ingredients are \"precooked\". Now, I guess that is something you have to do to get pizza out the door in ten minutes. But I don't know how many people are going to come back for that kind of delivery!"}
{"text":"I really love all the Upward Projects concepts, but Federal Pizza could be my favorite option for lunch.    The Double Down lunch special is a really good value at $10.50.  Pick any Pizza and any Salad and get a half portion of each for $10.50.  That is a great deal, especially once you come during dinner and see what your bill looks like compared to lunch.  I really enjoyed the Pineapple Express Pizza on my last visit, also always love the Federal Chopped Salad.    If you're in the area, I'd suggest popping in for lunch, and giving the Double Down Lunch Special a go.  Definitely some bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Friends who know put Fed in their top pizza  spot. It's a defendable position, but not mine. Top5 maybe. I will say that the lunch double down ( half pizza, half salad) with a pitcher of black market aftermath is ad good as any lunch I've had in Phoenix in  the last 20 years. Great job and interesting menu."}
{"text":"Loved the AT LAST Pizza!  Unusual toppings, but delicious flavors.  My husband had the CHEF'S WHIM Pizza and was rather disappointed.   Both would have been better with some Garlic.  Fun atmosphere.  Ate at the bar and the service was superb."}
{"text":"They make a mean Manifesto!  This is my new LGO. Sorry, LGO but this place is g-oo-d!  A coworker and I went and sat at the bar during lunch hour. The bartender was very friendly and attentive, even while he was busy making drinks for the other guests. He helped us understand their menu and shared some background with us on their favorite dishes.  After such a great experience and realizing they have a drive-thru, I was hooked!  I love calling in my Manifesto and picking it up without getting out of my car (or unbuckling my toddler to run in for a quick errand). Makes for a great Friday night at home with pizza and a movie!  We had the grilled vegetable plate too, prior to the manifesto pizza, and for not being a cauliflower fan they sure do know how to make yummy cauliflower!  I ate it all and wanted more.   3 thumbs up, if I could!"}
{"text":"Just a quick warning. Their pizza is addictive. Really well made foods. Can not wait to drag my friends back again."}
{"text":"Patio seating at its best!!  Lovely pizza and a great bottle of wine... talk, eat and sip all while watching the neighborhood dogs go by on their evening walks. It's a good life!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza with amazing service. We shared the margherita pizza with pepperoni. The ingredients were very fresh and the crust was amazing. Also loved the salad selection and wine selection. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Several friends had recommended this place to me, so I was really looking forward to my first experience at Federal.  A coworker suggested that we go to celebrate my recent promotion. I made a reservation for 15 people for 5 pm that night. The hostess on the phone was really sweet and only asked that we be conscious that another large group was coming in at 8.  Being that this was a large party and we had approximately 3 hours before the next group came in, it seemed reasonable to me that not all 15 people would arrive right at 5. By 6 pm, about half the group had arrived and most of us had ordered drinks and apps--however, this was about the time we started getting pressure from the waiter and hostess. About every 20 minutes, they would come up to the table and ask where the rest of the party was. In turn, I was texting my group to get their ETA and let them know the staff was getting irritated. I learned there was a bad accident on the 10 and most of them were stuck in traffic, but they were all on their way. During this time I was still ordering drinks so the staff didn't feel like their time was being wasted, but this became difficult to do as our waiter had stopped appearing at our table.  Once again, the hostess came up and asked if the rest of the party was still coming. I explained that they were, but that traffic was bad. She let me know that they needed the extra tables to seat people and I told her she could take them. The tables were not taken though and the rest of the group had arrived and ordered by 7. The waiter made some passive aggressive comments to the latecomers about being 2 hours late.  I've worked in food service and I know that dealing with flaky customers is frustrating. However, I was doing my best to make the most out of the situation and I feel like our waiter was pretty rude about it. The food itself was okay, but it wasn't good enough to compel me to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"This review is *long* over due.   I'm so sorry Federal Pizza, I really am!  You feed me, You love me and then I abandon you.  (Not really, because I come back with my hungry tummy all too often.)  SERVICE The folks that work are wonderful. I am remiss in providing names. Which is horrible. My first visit sold me on this place. The server went above and beyond (so I thought, but that just how they are here) to help a teenager select a drink (non-alcoholic!) that met his palate suitably.   Every (and I sincerely mean that) visit since the level of service has been impeccable. I usually show up later than my table mates and join in the fray of conversation. Even though meals are mid-flight, and drinks have been poured, someone ALWAYS shows up for me. Like magic.  THEY KNOW THEIR STUFF As I haven't had much time to study the menu, I ask for suggestions for wine. With some guidance I have *never* been steered wrong with my choice. A sample is provided and I am happy.   Just roll me over and leave me in my booth please.  Maybe with a pillow and blanket.  SHOUT OUT I did catch one name in my last visit. Rian. He's the shizzle.  I arrived to find he had run over NEXT DOOR to pick up something sweet. Yes, a dessert for my teen friend. (High maintenance that one :) With complete familiarity of the wine menu he provided a wonderful selection for me. Rian totally understood the flexible timing required from our table, and respected it.   A FAVORITE FOOD ITEM When I inquired about the Porchetta Sandwich Rian sighed. Come on kids. When someone is so happy about food - YOU GET IT! (Slow roasted Pork Loin + Pork Belly  + Arugula + Caramelized Onion + LEMON! on Homemade bread.)  (Again, this Rian is the bomb.)  I've been watching what I eat and trying to take portions home. Yeah, not THAT night. But honestly I've never met anything at Federal Pizza that disagreed with me. It's usually the portions that defeat me.  If I lived any closer this could be dangerous."}
{"text":"Great place for rustic artisan pizzas and brews/wine! We ordered two pizzas and some wings and everything was delicious and brought to us extremely fast. The inside is very nice and tidy however the outdoor seating is what we were after and it didn't disappoint. I'm sure there are a lot of pizza places in the area but Federals has the most unique pizzas I've seen."}
{"text":"Yum! Had the brussels sprout pizza and the sweet potato pizza. Both were amazing! Tried their homemade wine coolers and those were both interesting and refreshing. Service was awesome! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Always good,always,on point.their fried veggies are delicious, just like their burrata with jam.love their beer selection."}
{"text":"Love the look and feel of this joint. We grabbed a late dinner here but were surprised to learn there was still a 20 minute wait.   We moseyed on over to the bar where we were greeted by a nice bartender.  Hubby and I both wanted a break from all that beer from watching baseball so we went easy with their delicious-sounding wine coolers.  I ordered a strawberry rhubarb and hubby went with the blueberry hibiscus.  From what I can tell, it's syrup + sparking wine??  Both were very tasty and refreshing.  I inquired whether this was available to go (like their beer and wine) but alas, it was not.  We got seated and took a few minutes to peruse the menu, eventually ordering a side of their meatball, their polenta sticks, the TLC salad (split for us in the kitchen) and the brussels sprout pizza.  Meatball was of good solid construction and the sauce it came with really impressed.  The best part of our meal really was the polenta but it was also the component that made us feel REALLY guilty.  Polenta sticks were fried and served with their version of the Romesco sauce (creamy).  Mind-numbingly and heart-stoppingly tasty.  We had to force ourselves to stop and save room for the salad and the pizza.  The salad came next and was very well made and delicious.  Hubby didn't appreciate the large chunks of pears but I was fine with it.  The pizza came and frankly, this was the least impactful of our dishes.  Or maybe perplexing.  I know, we made the decision to order a pizza with brussels sprouts on it...but somehow the flavors just didn't come together for us.  We ended up taking a large part of it to go and snacking on it just a little bit in our hotel room.  We killed the leftover polenta sticks a few hours later but unfortunately, being cold didn't make the brussels sprouts taste any better on the pizza. (And I do love me some brussels sprouts!)  Service was friendly and very helpful.  Our server was sweet and totally reminded me of a friend of ours.  We would totally return if only to try another pizza and have more wine coolers...many, many more..."}
{"text":"Great pizza but the last 2 times I've ordered its never ready and I have to sit and wait in drive through at least 15 minutes. Let us know if your running behind so we don't need to sit in scorching heat. Not happy."}
{"text":"Ok Ok....maybe I have a love hate relationship with this place, but the BF and I went here again with Jon and Amy H. (who love this place) on Sat for lunch and I wasn't impressed...at all. We wanted to share a pizza, but they said they couldn't make a half cheese half manifesto pizza due to different cooking times, which lead to us to ordering WAY too much food. I got the manifesto add brussels and he got the caprese sandwich. The pizza was alright, but it just didn't have the flavor it had the last time...it was boring for having so many ingredients. The sandwich was also pretty boring...definitely nothing special. I also had one of their strawberry wine cooler and I was not a fan....it wasn't very sweet and it had a lot of ice, which made it hard to drink. I just thought it was ok overall.....the bad part actually happened today. I reheated a couple slices in the toaster oven and the cheese turned totally plastic -y! I have no idea how that happened, but it was pretty gross. This makes me not really want to have their pizza again, especially since half of the (not so cheap) pizza went in the trash."}
{"text":"So they get an extra star from me for 1- they have ranch! 2- it was bomb.com! Most nice pizza places that you go to don't even have ranch, which I don't even know how that's possible if they have salads..  I've been here twice now and have loved both times. We ordered the Manifesto which was delicious! It comes with mushrooms, sausage, goat cheese, red sauce and their fennel. I also ordered their Pinot Noir which was quite tasty.   The customer service was also really good. Water cup was never empty and our waiter really knew his shizz on the menu. I wish there was one on my side of town! I'll be back soon. =)"}
{"text":"Way too long to get in on a Friday night.. Two hour wait for 4 people. Hostess is clueless..several open tables spread apart.i L"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  The excellent food was exceeded only by the friendly atmosphere and great menu.  I wish they were in Tucson!!  I'll make a point to come back here again."}
{"text":"The Margherita pizza was awesome enough for 2+ people. Great service, prices are good for the superb quality of food and had a nice patio. Busy place but worth the wait. Can't wait to go back! :D"}
{"text":"Always delightful. The salads are amazing and that pizza crust is outstanding. We like hanging out here on weekends and it's our adult kids. Did I mention the wine and beer deals on the weekends?  Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"So it hurts me to have to give this place 1 star.  Because my Wife and I have been here many many times and love this place.  This star is reflective of the treatment received last night while dining with my Wife and Daughter.  Tom, our waiter was very cordial in the beginning.  However, upon seeing my 22 year old daughter touch my Wife's beer glass, he ran over and shouted that \"If you are going to touch that glass I need to see your ID immediately!\"  I responded that she is not drinking with us.  And he continued \"Well I saw her touch the glass!\"  He then ran over to report us to the managers, who never approached us.  Very uncomfortable to say the least.  Minutes go by and he never comes back to our table.  I then politely ask the Host if we could please be served our food and have someone  check on us.  Tom begrudgingly returned and brought our food, and this time, asked me if I planned on eating food, or if I was going to \"drink my meal!\"  I explained to him kindly, yet very offended, as my \"meal\" was a glass of Pinot Grigio, because of a very bad surgery that I was unable to eat food!  But thank you for implying I am an alcoholic.  At this point I ushered him away.  And we were attended to by the manager who was very kind, and she was also nice enough to inform me that Tom had decided that I didn't like him so he abandoned our table.  So while the food, ambiance, and most staff are very good, I cannot say that I would return to a place that allowed that kind of mistreatment.  It completely destroyed our night.  This was a first for me and my family."}
{"text":"worst bar ever. we found roaches in our food !!!! disgusting place , and the manager wouldn't event recognize the bugs !!!!!! do not go here"}
{"text":"We love this place. The atmosphere, the wait staff, the beer, the food- all excellent! We have been here countless times and we have never been dissatisfied. The lamb bolognese is to die for!"}
{"text":"I have literally never had a poor experience here. The pizza is first class and the crust is actually to die for! Love the look, love the pizza, and especially Love the lunch deal"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and reasonable prices, great service! Can't complain! Mozzarella cheese made right here at the restaurant,   Yummy!!!!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my current favorite restaurant!  Every time I come the food is delicious!  I love their pizzas, but just recently tried the barrata.  (Not sure if I'm spelling that correctly, but it's an appetizer of mozzarella that is still a little creamy, sprinkled with sea salt, and you spread it on this delicious bread!  So yummy!!  The service is hit or miss at times, but the food is what keeps me coming back!  I don't love the restaurant decor as much because it just doesn't have that homey feeling that I love getting from places like pizzeria bianco or cibo.  But the food.....yum!"}
{"text":"I wish I could do a review below 1 star. Very disappointed all around!! I ordered a glass of red Cabernet and my wine tasted like a water down blended wine. We ordered the Seasonal Salad and was disappointed with the portions size. Our pizza had hardly any ingredients on it and the dough was under cooked. I would not recommend this place to anybody and in fact I will make sure to tell people about my experience. Very disappointed!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in the valley! Service is excellent! Pizza's were cooked perfectly. The dough is so light and delicious. Pizza the way it should be.  Overall atmosphere is inviting and comfortable. A place for everyone!"}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to go crazy over this place but alas! We came here on a Monday night to take advantage of the pizza-plus-2-pitchers-of-beer-for-$20 special. It's a pretty fantastic deal, if you ask me. We got started with a pitcher of the oatmeal stout and an order of F&A veg board. This was a pretty good start. The Romesco sauce it came with was pretty great and so was the beer. I was waiting eagerly to put in my order of the pepperoni pizza and I asked for mozzarella as a topping. Such a bummer that the pizza was a let down!! I have heard some really amazing things about the food here and I was secretly hoping that I would like their pizza more than Grimaldi's but it didn't even come close. We were hesitant to order dessert but ended up getting one anyway. In hindsight, we could've totally skipped it. We placed an order for doughnut holes and they were served with a side of chocolate sauce. The doughnut holes were alright but they were laden with sugar. So much so that I had to brush some off before eating. And the chocolate sauce was burnt :/ Not the best experience for me but it might have been an off-night in the kitchen. I left with a slightly bitter taste in my mouth.. literally!"}
{"text":"EVERYONE has been talking about Federal Pizza so we had to make our way over to check it out.  Atmosphere is pretty cool, didn't blow me away but still cool. The service was excellent.  We started our meal with the meatball trio appetizer and it was really, really good. The meatballs were very tender and full of flavor.   We shared some pizza (cheese pizza) as well and it was also delicious. The appropriate amounts of sauce/cheese/crust ratio. The rest of the menu sounded great and we wanted to try other items but we kind of had to try the pizza for out first visit.   I would recommend a visit to this place but I'm not sure if I would ever crave it or NEED to go back, but if people wanted to go, I wouldn't say no!"}
{"text":"Yeah, you read that right: 5 stars. Based on last night, it could not possibly have gone any better than it did. A friend of mine, Noelle, had her birthday dinner there last night. There were ten of us in the party. We ordered a few pizzas to share and some of us ordered appetizers as well. I almost gobbled up an entire pizza. I'm not kidding.  Sweet baby jesus. The polenta side was nothing short of amazing. Sticks of polenta, deep-fried and then rolled in freshly grated parmesan. It was served with a side of some sort of crazy good sauce on the side. When the order arrived, everyone around me was eyeing my plate. I shared, of course, but not very willingly. I am drooling as I write this, by the way. One of the pizzas we ordered, the Manifesto, was really good. I had 3 pieces! We also ordered the Margherita, the 4-cheese, and one that was covered in fresh greens. I don't even care about the name of it, that's how good it was. One of the girls brought Noelle a gift basket of wines. During the dinner, the basket tipped and one of the wine bottles fell out and smashed on the floor. Noelle cries over spilled wine. Federal Pizza replaced the bottle! It wasn't even bought there! How cool is that? Service was impeccable. I'm a thirsty person. My drink never emptied enough for me to ask for a refill. We were there for 3 hours and the servers we had never forgot about us. Well, it's not like they could. We're an unforgettable crowd."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about the food and service. My only complaints are that it is too crowded and noisy for my preferences, but that has never stopped me from waiting in line for half an hour for perhaps the Valley's finest pizza."}
{"text":"Oh Federal Pizza...How I love thee!    I just want to sit and try every single one of their wine coolers. My current favorite is the watermelon mint.  Not only are the wine coolers delicious but so is the food. One of my favorite things to eat are meatballs (I know weird right?!) and they are so darn good here. Don't forget to order the Bambolini, even if you are full from the pizza...trust me!! :)  I have been here several times and have never once been disappointed.  I also have to mention the service because it is better than amazing! Everyone is helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. For starters the staff was super nice. The atmosphere was really up beat hard not to have a good time. We came in towards the end of happy hour and the drink specials were great. I love the pizza here we will have to come back here again."}
{"text":"This place has great food, drink, and fun! It's a good place to come with a group of people. They have tasty pizza and I love their ranch! I also recommend the polenta fries! Their desserts are just okay but by that time I am full anyways. I would recommend federal pizza!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming pizza.  I ordered takeout for a $15 pineapple express pizza.  It was small and there weren't nearly enough toppings for my liking and I'm not sure if I want to go back to Federal Pizza.  I'm sure they have better pizzas than that one, so I'm giving three stars on potential.  Also, when you order this pizza, make sure you finish it because it didn't make a good cold pizza.  They're so hip, they give you chili flakes and parmesan cheese in dimebags to aid your pizza fix."}
{"text":"I normally don't post reviews yet I inclined to because of the proximity.  Italian food is a difficult food to get right and I'm happy to report that Federal Pizza gets their cuisine right.  Firstly, their pizza is excellent, which is no easy feat. Most pizza joints flub their pizza pie at onset with the sauce, usually too sweet or too spicy. Federal finds a happy medium.  During my visit, I had their Margherita pizza, a white pizza covered with tomato, basil and olive oil. It was delicious.   It was here, in addition to the Federal Salad, I could tell the ingredients used were fresh. The sauce came from fresh tomatoes, as did the tomatoes on top and other toppings.  All of this came at a reasonable price; I dined with two other people and the overall bill amounted to just over $60. That's great dining no matter how you shake it."}
{"text":"After biking by this place several times before it opened, finally got to go. On a Thursday night, there was a 45 minute wait. At first I was bemoaning it but then I figured it's better than waiting 4 hours at Pizzeria Bianco. I went for the burrata--which I could have just sustained myself on that. The house-made soft cheese was the perfect texture and not too salty. The scoop they give is plenty split between 3-4 people with the accompanying crostinis. I tried two different pizzas: one with mushroom and Schreiner's sausage, the other was \"The Casanova\" _ prosciutto, dates, ricotta and arugula. I never thought of dates on pizza but I'm a believer. The dates' sweetness combined with the prosciutto is almost heaven-sent. I liked that much better and would fight off anyone who tried to take my share. I know it may be kind of sucky that their pizzas are only available in one size. But hey, that means you get leftovers of some really fantastic pizza.  The vibe is definitely a cross of hipster and white-collar work crowd. Valet parking is the only option since the surrounding streets do not allow parking. Blah. Hoping the next time I go, it will be on my bike. Also, if it's packed, it may be hard to hear people if you're seated inside."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I love their pizza selection - a lot of new and interesting combinations (one of my dining companions noted that their pizzas are too weird) but if you like that kind of thing, then this is your place!  I got the brussel sprout pizza that came with pancetta, and it was so good!  My only complaint is that the crust was a little too large and took up too much of the pizza.  I also got the half TLC salad that had mixed greens and beets.  Yum, I love beets and always enjoy having them in a salad!  I also appreciate that they take reservations for lunch.  Servers were very friendly and although the parking lot is small we had no trouble finding a space at lunch. All in all, a great experience!"}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love!  I've been here two weekends in a row now.  The sibling restaurant to Postino/Churn finally figured out the beer scene with some decent draft choices and the option of keeping the party going at home with growlers and chubs.  The wine coolers were delicious - moreso I found with a straw, but that might be personal preference.  Strawberry Rhubarb is my favorite (so far).   The pizza is great - in the same vein as Humble Pie and Cibo - but better.  In Phoenix, I think only The Parlor could be better.  But when I'm jonesing for a meatball pizza, I'm headed to Federal.  Cozy/swanky interior, sweet little patio outside.    I read about the Corn Coins so we checked them out, but the Mister Mister was better.  Corn is corn.  Corn with cheese is corn with cheese.  Delicious, but not groundbreaking.    Our new go-to for sure!!  It's our new go-to restaurant."}
{"text":"Okay, so the food was absolutely fan-freakin-tastic but wow, service was a bit of an upset.    It all started a week ago when I talked to the nice manager about wanting to make reservations for a table of 14.  None of us has been here before and we were very excited to give this place a try.  After being told that reservations were booked from 5-9PM, I was kindly told that had if I had at least half my party here, a table *should* be opened up.  He was nice and professional and it's understandable that hey, Saturdays are a busy night.  What I didn't plan on was that when we arrived on Saturday and being told that wait time was an hour, we were actually going to wait almost two hours for two SEPARATE tables.    What?  I get that you can't predict precisely on table turn-over times but if we're going to wait almost double the expected time, I'd assume we'll be sitting together at one table.  If we were going to be split apart, why did so many people that came after us get seated before us?  Wow.  We had asked our hostess if we can move our patio tables ourselves so we can sit together but she gave us a wishy washy answer, leaning more towards no, whereas the gentleman working said it was fine for us to move the tables.  Lost in communication much?  By then, it wasn't worth the battle as it was close to two hours by that point and we were all starving.  Two awkwardly separated tables it is.    Our waitress made a few errors with drinks but she was nice about it.  The wait on the food was also a whole other ordeal with one table getting food 20 mins before the other table which made them have to wait awkwardly on us while we finished so we can all get ice cream across the street afterwards.  So yes, while the food was tasty, fresh, and the char crust was amazing and their homemade grapefruit and mint wine cooler was crisp and refreshing, the whole waiting and seating fiasco left a bad taste in my mouth.   Would I be back?  Maybe.  We all have our off-days and the beets side dish and The Answer [Spicy sausage, apple, Gorgonzola, spinach, candied pecans, and fennel] were pretty delish!    This place definitely is definitely more suited for smaller parties.  Be warned!"}
{"text":"Update! They have great gluten free crust and they'll cook it on a separate pan in a separate oven if you have a major gluten intolerance! So happy I can eat here again!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this restaurant so much I will be going again  Freshmade pizza love loved the music and I'm not a craft beer drinker but I tried, next time I'll try the wine  The staff they were excellent very warm casual environment."}
{"text":"We visited here from out of town. Phoenix, like Minneapolis, has a ton of pizza options. Our local friend recommended Federal to us tonight. It was a great recommendation.  We enjoyed the Mon and Tue special of a pizza and bottle of wine for $20. We also ordered the TLC salad, beets and pears really go well together for a salad, and we ordered the Polenta Sticks with romesco sauce. Romesco is one of my latest obsessions and this was as good as my partner makes his so nice to have something homemade feeling out of town. We had the Manifesto pizza with sausage, goat cheese and fennel. Delicious combo of flavors with a crispy on the outside and chewy crust. This would give Black Sheep pizza a run for competition back in Minneapolis.   The vibe was hip, casual but not pretentious. We had great service. The place was busy on a Monday night so that was a good sign."}
{"text":"Great food but eat there. Takeout for anything but pizza will grant you about half the portion of what you'd be served at the table. Example. Lamb Bolognese at the restaurant would serve three and at $15 it is a delicious meal. Take out, it serves one, maybe two very small portions still at $15. The spaghetti and meatballs was a small portion as well.   If you're going to offer takeout, make it a delight, right? It leaves them more tables to fill up.   Figuring the packaging costs? Well, we can't eat the containers. Ok, that was a bit snarky but I was left with not enough food to serve three people.   Just feel a bit cheated. And you know who else is famous for this? Pei Wei at 7th Ave and McDowell."}
{"text":"Great pizza and very efficient and friendly waitstaff.  Unfortunately they only serve flavored iced teas which causes Federal Pizza to drop a whole star in my review.    Please consider adding unflavored black iced tea."}
{"text":"never had a pizza I didn't like here. some sound strange, but they do it right!! Casanova pizza (sweeter pizza w figs and ricotta & arugula w balsamic) + Sweet Potato pizza (sweet potato & ricotta).... equally wonderful totally different. love to get both and alternate :) I love the atmosphere of the uptown project restaurants. great music, lighting and all over experience. can be a bit loud inside for a big group, but it's all great. enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizza & bar (I live in arcadia & this blows LgoNo! Outta the water--in fact I drive by LgoNo! to go to federal grab a pizza & refill the grower thru the convenient drive thru & don't mind the drive!!). Ps plenty of pkg too!!!"}
{"text":"So good!!! Yum. We got a cheese pizza and a sweet potato pizza to go. I love their drive thru window - super convenient for times when you feel lazy.  The sweet potato pizza is delicious - if you like sweet potatoes, try this pizza. The ricotta on top was creamy and complimented the sweet potatoes wonderfully. The crust was buttery and crispy. The cheese pizza was also excellent - really nice blend of flavors.  I feel like getting things to go is never quite as good as eating them in the restaurant. The pizza was so good even after picking it up and letting it get lukewarm in the car that I'm excited about sitting down in the restaurant and having a full meal. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place! Not only is it a great space in a great location, but the service was very good & the food was tasty!  We tried the following: homemade wine cooler (blueberry & hibiscus), fried green tomatoes, fingerling potatoes, and pizza with onions and mushrooms. All were absolutely delicious. While it doesn't beat Spinatos (best pizza in AZ) it's definitely excellent quality pizza. We weren't feeling adventurous this time around, but next time I'm totally going to give the sweet potato pizza a shot!"}
{"text":"Last weekend I went to dinner here with a friend and his two boys. We had pizzas, meatballs and the chopped salad along with their local brews.   We had the best service. Everyone was so attentive, the boys who are pretty picky eaters, ate all their four cheese pizzas. We ordered a combo pizza and when it was served to us, we were told that they would be bringing us another one because one piece was not touching the end of the pizza pan, we said we didn't think that would affect the taste of the pizza. Didn't matter we got another pizza on the house. Lemonade and water glasses were constantly filled without asking, beer always came out with clean glasses, and dirty dishes were not never left on the table more than a minute or two, can't get any better than that. Our dinner with tip for 4 people was over $100 (we laughed and said who goes out for pizza and beers for $100 bucks), this time it was money well spent! We even played charades at the dinner table for about an hour after we finished eating, the restaurant was busy and there were people waiting for tables and not once did anyone ask us \"to give up\" the table.   Great job to all the staff who waited on us last Saturday 1/18/2014 afternoon. We will definitely be back.   Thank you, Thank you, Thank You"}
{"text":"I love this place... I am a pizza guy and this place rocks. I will be back for the pizza."}
{"text":"Anchovies in the dipping sauce... yes, and I'm told this after I explicitly asked (twice to be sure) that the appetizer was vegetarian and had already eaten most of it.  To make matters worse, it's rather common for people to not like anchovies, so you'd think they would make it a priority to inform people of that sort of thing in advance.  Nope.  Place was incredibly dark, so much so that I felt like some grandpa who wishes he had a little flashlight to read the menu.  Pizza had a good crust except for the burnt 'n charred portions, and the toppings were a bit scarce.  Beer list was good with many craft beers from nearby states and a few imports.  Thankfully, not another place with a bunch of lame Arizona beers.  Service was confusing because it was as if we had 2 or 3 different people involved in the process, and even at that we still had trouble getting a box and cheque so we could leave.  Prices were reasonable and parking is tight.    Really wish there wasn't the anchovies issue."}
{"text":"This is my go to for pizza recommendations. I've never had a bad pie here, and I've tried almost all of them. Cool atmosphere too as the restaurant is in an old bank and a lot of mid-century architecture comes through. The servers are always friendly, plus they do $5 pitchers of beer every day before 5. Great spot."}
{"text":"Ordered the Pineapple Express and a couple of beer flights. Such a delicious choice! If you like pineapple on your pizza, I highly recommend that you try this one. So tasty! We came on a Monday so we took advantage of their Monday special which is a pizza & full bottle of wine for $20. Best part- we were able to take the wine to go because we were full from the pizza and beer. Great beer selections are a plus. Very friendly service. Despite being quite busy, the folks here managed to stay attentive and cordial without rushing us. I like this place and will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Federal Pizza, the first time was just okay. Today i realized what all the hype is about . WOW the pizza is AMAZING that my hubby and i finished the whole pie and that never happens. We also had an incredible Cesar salad with grilled chicken. I will for sure return for more."}
{"text":"Here's a nod for the handcrafted wine-cooler concept.... Maybe I enjoy them so much because they take me back to Bartles-and-James-inspired high school shenanigans.  Federal is solid.  There is a lot of artisan pizza competition these days, and I don't know if it's the best in town, but it's definitely got a good vibe and creative ideas.   I'll be back, and I eagerly await the next upward offering..."}
{"text":"New favorite pizza spot. Great beer list, awesome brick oven pizza and cool atmosphere. Plus they have a drive thru!"}
{"text":"I came here last week with my sisters and some other friends. We had been planning to hang out at Postino but they were packed so we walked over to check out the new place. I was very disappointed and not really in the mood for a hipster pizza joint but it must have been fate since it was there that I found my new love: wine coolers!  I know what you are thinking: \"wine coolers? As in those sickly sweet bottles of crap from theeighties!?!\" No, my friends, these are totally different.  Made with fresh fruit pulp and muddled herbs that are strained and then poured over Spanish champagne, they are absolutely delicious. Between the seven of us at the table we tried every flavor and they were all fantastic.  My favorites were the ginger one and the strawberry rhubarb. They were so crisp and refreshing! A ton of flavor but not too sweet. I know we also had some tasty appetizers but now I can't even remember what they were because I was so enamored with the drinks. I guess I will have to come back and try the pizza atsome point."}
{"text":"This Place is really good, the food was really good and the pizza tasted amazing. Their happy hour on beer is really good as well. They have a great selection on craft beers as well. I Would Recommend this for everyone. it does get packed inside though the table that they sat us at was really small for the group that I came with."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food and decent prices. Excellent and attentive service from everyone working, it truly seems like they work as a team and are vested in every customer getting good service.   We went for lunch where we ordered the veggie board, and two half pizzas and salad. The roasted veggies were an amazing flavorful appetizer, cauliflower was my favorite and the potatoes were my partners. They come lightly dusted with Parmesan.   I got the pepperoni pizza and chop salad, loved them. My partner ordered the potato pizza, added an egg, and the Cesar salad. The crusts are awesome, it reminds me of neapolitan style crust which is my favorite.   I will be coming back! To try more pies, salads, and hopefully those desert donuts. Thank you for a great first impression Federal Pizza!"}
{"text":"I've been driving past this place whenever I'm in town as my parent's are only 3 miles N of here.  Tonight we were looking for a late dinner and found out at 9:30 that our first choice closed at 10:00, so we turned back to Federal.  Well worth the trip.  First and very important: they're dog-friendly.  You can take your pooch on the porch.  Second, the entrance is on the west side of the building.  Third, wood-fired pizza oven.  Fourth, good pizza.  We ordered two: a sweet potato and a pepperoni, and my wife and I were quite happy.  We didn't get dessert as I made a chocolate mousse pie Friday morning.  We shall return, well worth it, reasonably priced, and open late!  And they have excellent specials Monday and Tuesday nights if you like beer or wine with your pizzas."}
{"text":"Our server was great but generally the service was a little slow.  food came out really fast.  Brussel Sprouts seemed pre-made and were not very crispy.  Generally food was good but not a place I would go out of my way to go for given its about 20 miles from home.  Would definitely visit again if nearby.  Plus - they do have a great deal on Monday/Tuesday for a pizza and bottle of wine / pitcher of beer for $20.  Thats worth going a bit further for!"}
{"text":"Wow, another great restaurant by a fine set of operators.  The vibe in the restaurant is awesome, decor is subtle & stellar and the staff is phenomenal.  Pizza was above average, have not picked out my favorite yet, but all 3 of the ones we ordered were terrific.  Their take on the wine cooler was very refreshing and extremely tasty.  Unfortunately have only been there once, but look forward to going back very soon.  The pricing was more than fair especially for the quality of food you will be getting.  Great job!"}
{"text":"3 stars because there are so many better pizza places. Federal pizza is definitely cool and a neat place to go to or try.  I love the drink and beer selection and appetizers are tasty.  Haven't been impressed with the pizza   The first time I went we sat at the bar and the service was outstanding! Last night we sat outside and service was a little off. I still would go back but will try the pasta or salads next time."}
{"text":"My mouth is ridiculously happy! Decided to try a pasta dish, the Mickey White, with a trio of mushroom, crispy chunks of breaded chicken and spinach in a subtley spicy cream sauce over fusili. YUM!  The hand blended watermelon-mint is a refreshing libation for summer.   My teen got the Casanova pizza with ricotta, dates, prosciutto and arugala. She kept raving about the crust and how she'd \"totally\" order this pizza again.   So there you have it - two enthusiastic thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to checking out Federal Pizza. Atmosphere was great, service was okay, food was not what I expected. We ordered four pizzas for a large party of eight people, three quarters of the pizzas ordered were very undercooked in the middle, which made them doughy and soggy. I then asked the server about how our pizzas were, she said this is because they are woodfired. She then told me I would have to order my pizzas well Done, most woodfired pizza kitchens make sure the pizzas are cooked all the way, regardless of the woodfired method. On the service side, after we ate appetizers and the pizza was delivered, I had to ask for fresh plates and silverware so we could eat our pizza. The server should be looking for things like that, attention to detail. After all that is why we go out to eat for the experience of great food and service. When I go out and treat several people to a meal, I expect to have great service, when I am spending a couple hundred dollars are just a few dollars in your restaurant. At this point I am debating whether or not to give Federal Pizza a second chance."}
{"text":"I drive by this place every day on my way home from work and it looks like it used to be a bank...  Anyway, I met a friend here for dinner and unfortunately the wait for tables was going to be pretty long and I was starving so we sat at the bar.  I had the Big Star pizza which was excellent and we shared the Vinnie the Butcher appetizer. Most of the appetizer was good by the peppers included with the meats and cheese blew me away. I don't know if I've ever had anything so spicy in my life!  I couldn't finish the pizza by myself (my friend ordered her own pizza) so I took it home and had it as leftovers the following night. It reheated pretty well. I'd definitely like to go back sometime."}
{"text":"Food atmosphere service is great. Very quick for a full service restaurant.  can go there for lunch and be back by the hour."}
{"text":"Had the big star pizza  and oh my goodness it was delicious   they have a great variation beer on draft. They also have a to go lane, but inside is dark and mellow. Nice bar setup."}
{"text":"Loved this place!   Great pizza and the fried polenta, holy crap it's good. I can't stop thinking about it.  The ambiance is nice but a little cramped. They have a patio that I bet helps with seating when it's not blistering hot outside.    I would have given another star if we didn't have to wait so long for a table and if our waitress wasn't so rude.   The other servers that brought food to our table were super friendly and engaging but the girl with the super short black hair kinda ruined the fun. She should not be a server. She is the type of server that doesn't write anything down, gets it wrong and then gets mad when you want it corrected. We didn't get food we had ordered and drinks that we ordered were not correct etc.   Anyway, go here and if you see that you are about to be served by the girl with super short black hair, politely ask for another server or just deal with her and tell her to write your order down.   Either way the fried polenta will still be delicious!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is bomb like donkey kong!  In my opinion, better than Pizzeria Bianco.  I tried the sweet potato/sage/ricotta pizza and the casanova.  I'm eating leftovers right now and it still tastes amazing.  Service was great!  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"very good pizza, gladiator pizza was a favorite"}
{"text":"We come here for the food, service, and ambiance!  Another Upward Projects success turning the old Al Beadle building into a cool pizza place.  The pizzas are great and the classic Postino special for $5 pitchers and glasses of wine is in full effect before 5pm!"}
