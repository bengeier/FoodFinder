{"text":"Great spot for lunch. Thanks for being in the 'hood.  Hot, tasty sausages and hot dogs. Clean spot, fast service. Perfect for a lunch time treat."}
{"text":"I have been walking by this restaurant for the past month and have been salivating for the day that I could try this gourmet dog. Today was that day!  First off, the dog itself was delicious (I had the Frankie Goes to Buffalo- the panko crusting was amazing!! My co-workers had the Fancy Marsala and the Fancy 90210). My only disappointment was the price and the portion size for fries. For a regular sized 'dog with the toppings it was 7.25 before taxes adding in fries for 3.50 and I had a surprisingly small lunch for over $10. The fries were my biggest price disappointment since it was about a cup worth of fries for such a high price.   I get it though, it's a new hip place. But I think they need to remember it's still just a hotdog!   Overall, I think I would try it again, only because some of the options intrigue me but I'll have to bring a second lunch and save my pennies first!  Also- in response to the last comment. They do have a veggie dog option for $1"}
{"text":"Reviewed during: Fri Lunch time Service Speed: 3.5 / 5 Cooking speed: 3.5 / 5 Food Quality: 3.5 / 5 Food Quantity: 1 / 5 Price: 1 / 5  Cleanness: 4.5 / 5  Repeat: NO  It was not very busy during Friday lunch time.  It's very pricy for a tiny hotdog, I was expecting a size of a sausage. And they burnt the hotdog! I'm afraid the toppings and condiments tasted better than the meat...... I left the restaurant and went straight into Kensington for the rest of my meal."}
{"text":"Got the Coney Island dog to be safe since it was the most popular item. Taste was alright but the bread was so soggy from the chilli that my sausage just fell through the buns... I'll probably just stick to street meat if I'm craving a hot dog next time."}
{"text":"Today I decided to visit this place for the first time. Got the plain hot dog & a poutine, and it was quite delicious and tastier than I expected, and Also came with a good serving of food to go with it. This is the only location I've seen where Coca Cola comes in a glass bottle. (I'm pretty sure there maybe others too).   Whenever I'm in the area again, I'll definitely revisit."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy about this place. Only reason I'm giving this place a 2 star is because the hot dog was edible. The poutine I ordered was made with burnt fries, barely any gravy. I had placed a take away order so it was too late to return."}
{"text":"Fancy Franks is worth visiting if you are looking for something quick and familiar with a slight spin (and if you don't mind spending more than five dollars for a hot dog). Toppings range from the standard ketchup and mustard to BBQ baked beans. Thick milkshakes, doughnuts, and poutine all make the list of items never previously considered for pairing with a hot dog. But it works.   The chocolate milkshake is perfect. It is not too sweet, it is not too heavy, it isn't paired with mountains of whip cream. The flavor is deep and has layers, and unlike many shakes bought back home, is not made using the chocolate syrup that no matter how much you mix it, it never fully mixes.  The doughnuts are bite sized ringlets of dough made fresh to order, and the cinnamon glaze is great. Not only are they great fresh, sitting them in a fridge over night does them no harm.  The hotdogs can be messy, but then, how can anything with baked beans on top not be messy? This is not an \"order and go\" kind of place, not unless you want to be wearing your food.  As best I can tell, the hotdogs are nothing special. What sets Fancy Franks hot dogs apart from Seven Eleven hotdogs is the toppings selection, price, and freshness."}
{"text":"unfortunately they look better than they taste and they cost more than they're worth.   the dogs are plain 'ol dogs but the topping options are great - it's just the quality of said toppings are average.   the space is pretty chill and the doughnuts are pretty yummy though!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife came in today and ordered corn dogs and got them for take out oh boy wish I checked them out before I left 3 corn dogs was burnt missing batter and greasy as anything  the place on bloor is 10 times better hands down I also upload a picture of the corn dogs too"}
{"text":"Yah, it's a hotdog and a poutine...I'll give 3 stars to chip wagons if the food is good.  I gave 4 stars because the service and staff are excellent.  About the food, the bun is nicely steamed, the dog and ingredients are fresh.  The poutine is LOADED and I like the fact that the cheese curds are smaller and not huge chunks like the other places.  The gravy wasn't salty, just how I like it.  So why 4 stars?  I ordered the BBQ pork poutine.  I was watching them assemble the poutine, and when it came down to the pulled pork, the staff looked at me and said that they had to make more, but it would need to take a few minutes.  Am I supposed to enjoy my hotdog while my wife waits for her poutine?  Or should I leave the poutine, let it get cold for the pork.  NOPE, the staff told me to take my meal and enjoy, the poutine was complimentary and a new BBQ pork poutine was on its way.  TOP NOTCH Fancy Frank staff."}
{"text":"Gross. Paid $13 for Chicago dog with fries and a drink. The hotdog was absolutely swimming with mustard. It's like they just dumped a bucket of mustard on it. I tried wiping some of it off but after the 7th napkin, and being covered it it, I gave up. I never return food, but this was inedible. Charging this much for a hotdog, you think the staff would put some effort in it. I've never had a hotdog I couldn't eat before. 1/5"}
{"text":"Catering primarily to the lunch crowd, FF is a relatively small store front, with a large communal table down the center of the room, and a small seating area across the front window. I'm not sure how busy it gets around noon, but I can only imagine the anxiety of trying to nab on of these seats. I mean, these are not your average Yonge and Dundas street vendor wieners.  Trust me. Unless you have an office or apartment close by, or you really could care less about your outfit, you're probably going to want to sit down.  Thankfully, at closing time, seating was not an issue.   The way it works at FF is you can choose from the massive selection of outrageous hot dog concoctions (think Korean short ribs and kimchi), or you can choose to build your own.  FF offers a huge variety of \"free\" toppings like olives, sauerkraut, corn relish and specialty condiments, and you can add meat, cheese and other gourmet items (like sauteed peppers and onions or slaw) for a price ($2-3 each). You can also sub out your all beef hot dog for a sausage (sweet, spicy or chicken, $1 extra) or for my vegetarian friends, a veggie frank (free). In addition to wieners, they also serve fries, poutines, milkshakes and doughnuts.  I really wanted the doughnuts, but alas, were told that they had turned off their machine for the night. I also would have loved a sample of poutine, but guess what? I had already eaten an entire Thai meal and definitely only had the stomach space for one midnight snack, if that. So speaking of meals, this is what we had:   Franks Coney Island with chili, mustard, and requested sans chopped onions ($6.50) Both boys went with this classic and weren't disappointed. As in all of our choices, the wiener itself had a good beefy flavour and a satisfying snap in the casing.  I also liked the bit of charring from the grill. The bun was toasted for maximum topping security and flavour, and packed with the meaty rich chili. I have never had a Coney Island chili dog, but I loved the spicy tangy kick of the mustard against the bold beef flavour of the chili. Solid choice   Southern Fancy with BBQ pulled pork and cabbage slaw ($7.50) Also excellent, maybe my favourite. The pulled pork was generous and very tender and moist, while the slaw had a nice balance of tangy and creaminess. My only criticism would have been that I think it could have used some more (if there even was any?) BBQ sauce to add some smokiness to the party.  Frank and Beans with baked beans, bacon and maple syrup ($8) Totally reminded me of my childhood, and my sister's favourite stand by meal- beans and wieners. I was expecting sad little bacon bites, but was really impressed by the massive portion of crispy salty bacon against the soft supple texture of the sweet baked beans. The maple was absolutely not overwhelming, as it ended up being a really well balanced bite (well, maybe not nutritionally balanced).  The Frankaphone with Smoked Gruyere, Horseradish Cheddar Squeaky Curds, Honey Dijon Mayo ($9) Updated subsequent visit:Talk about rich, this dog was fat on fat on fat, thankfully cut by a little spicy dijon flavour. I loved the horseradishy heat and the chew of the curds, but I did think the whole thing needed a little acid to cut the fat. I was tempted to put a little ketchup on it just to brighten things up a bit, but I didn't want to ruin the French theme...."}
{"text":"ordered poutine and the coney island dog. the poutine was fine, the dog however was impossible to eat. there was so much chili on it, that it couldn't be picked up and eaten and the chili soaked through the bun, making it a big disgusting mess of hotdog, chili and broken bun. Nasty. The hotdogs appear to be pretty standard grocery store variety. Not sure what the fuss is all about, but if I want a gourment dog, I'll stick to Wvrst"}
{"text":"The service is beyond amazing, the portions are very generous and the food is absolutely delicious! The overall vibe is very chill! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been down to this area in a while, were looking for a quick bite, so in we went to Fancy Franks.  We ordered the Francine (breakfast in a hotdog, basically), the 90210 (avocados, bacon), plus poutine and and two drinks. The two dogs were really good, they hit the spot. The poutine was big, we didn't even finish it.   The manager/owner was a class act, super friendly. We'd definitely come back here and try some of the other dogs.  Some other reviews complained that it's just expensive hot dogs; our meal came to $26, which considering the ingredients and how filling the meal was, is a pretty good value in my opinion. I think it's more apt to say that Fancy Frank's is to hot dogs what Hero Burger is to burgers. If you don't care for nicer ingredients and better preparation, then don't complain that a cheaper burger can be had at McDonald's."}
{"text":"I love fancy franks! I get the mild farmers sausage, soooo yummy, great toppings. The buns are sooo pillowy soft, great texture. My coworkers always get the corn dog instead of fries, they love it, but the fries are really good too. The best thing is the freshly made donuts, they had a nutella one that was pupil-widening-good. It's pricey'ish for a hot dog, but it's also queen and spadina, other than mcdonalds you won't get much cheaper, and for a sausage not made of raccoon it's about right."}
{"text":"I got the Franks Got Seoul which has kimchi and short ribs. It was good but really wish they put more as it would've tasted better. Also got the cajun fries to share and these were delicious.   Might not seem like a reasonable price for almost $10 for a hot dog, but I think I would come here again."}
{"text":"I've only tried the chili dog and a dozen donuts, so take my review with a grain of salt. The hotdog tasted like a standard Schneiders, plus huge heapings of saucy ground beef on top. As expected, it got messy real fast... my hotdog eventually just fell through my bun and I had to eat it with a fork.  Not the best experience. I can't complain about the donuts, I got the off-menu option of vanilla/cinnamon glaze, and they were warm and gooey.   Nice atmosphere and good service, plus I got 15% off by showing my student card, but as some other reviewers have said, it's too pricey for just a hot dog, even it does have some innovative toppings. I'll stick with a spicy street meat sausage next time."}
{"text":"It's just expensive hotdogs.  I came here because my girlfriend and I were interested in trying gourmet hotdogs. The place is very bright, and had a faux-retro/hip vibe going on. The man at the cash (whom I suspect was the supervisor or owner) was not that friendly; almost annoyed.   We ordered the 90210 and Buffalo dogs. The avocado and tomato on the 90210 were refreshing and the deep fried dog for the Buffalo was tasty. That's about it. Nice, interesting takes on hotdogs, but too pricey. I'd rather go to Wvrst and get a sausage and beer."}
{"text":"Visited here the other week after a night out at the bars. After asking what is the most popular item, I was recommended to get the Coney Island Dog. The Coney Dog is topped with homemade chili, onions and mustard (which i asked for them to not include). Although it was good, I don't think it was worth the $8 and didn't have anything that really \"wowed\" me. The hot dog itself was juicy, however the toppings were fairly bland and basic. Overall, comparing the quality of the hot dog I received to that of a street vendor, I would say it was around the same or worse.  VERDICT: Good, but not worth the price. In the future if I get a hot-dog craving I will hit up a street vendor over this place."}
{"text":"It's pretty good, the pulled pork southern one was OK.. have had the Coney Island as well, standard fare.. id eat here again, although one hot dog is too small for a big person, you'd need at least 2, but then its gets to be a bit $$$. the doughnuts are pretty tasty as they are fresh.  no manager ever checked on me though. I dont mind the good ol' street meat too though.. would be a bit cheaper no doubt"}
{"text":"So happy this place opened up the street from my house.  Great menu selection, super friendly/upbeat staff.  All different types of sausages and hot dogs, buns white or whole wheat, steamed or toasted, with a bazillion toppings.  Very nice sides as well - poutine, chili, awesome French fries with gravy - and to top it off, their homemade donuts with a variety of toppings are simply amazing."}
{"text":"I've been in Toronto for about 2 months now and my buddy had been raving about this place the entire time. Today I was walking home and decided to stop by at 3:30 for some lunch. WOW. This place did not disappoint at all. I'm a pretty traditional guy when it comes to hot dogs - ketchup. The occasional coney dog. But the amount of options Fancy Frank's has, I had to go with the Southern Fancy. It has pulled BBQ pork and coleslaw on it. I just finished eating -- Fancy Frank's has changed my life."}
{"text":"The Frankie Goes To Buffalo ($7.25 - chicken bacon, carrots, celery, blue cheese dressing, buffalo wing sauce all on a panko fried wiener) was my favourite frank. I loved the flavours and the name (so cute). The chicken bacon, celery and carrots added a nice crunch. If you like wings, this is the dog for you!  The Traditional Poutine ($5.50) was drool-worthy and had just the right amount of squeaky curds and gravy.  They have the best milkshakes I've had in a loooong time. What made them so good? Loads and loads of ice cream (this aint no watered down milkshake)."}
{"text":"Fancy Frank's is an awesome respite from some of the too-cool-for-you restos and the tired old standbys on Queen St., West. When you first walk in, it might seem like one of those too-cool restaurants, but the staff are very friendly, and happy to help you out if you don't understand the menu.  The couple behind us wanted to know if there any vegetarian options, and were told that unless they actually add meat, almost anything can be vegetarian.  Of course we added meet. Delicious 90210 hot dog with guacamole, bacon, and a drizzle of olive oil. That was like bites from heaven.  And you know it's pretty awesome when you can say that about a hotdog.  Despite being busy, as we left, the cashier shouted out \"Goodbye ladies!\" Nice touch that made us feel very good about stopping in. Absolutely recommend this place, and we will be returning and making this a regular spot."}
{"text":"Came here last week on a whimp, was walking along college and decided to give a gourmet hot dog a try. Was feeling experimental and so came in, asked what was good on the list, the guy at counter said ( forgot the name) apparently it was the most expensive on the menu, possibly to upsale, it was $9. I noticed right away and asked for a $7.50 dog with feta, olives cucumber....on a steam bun. I paid over $8 for a hot dog that was regular size, nothing special or that great. I couldn't eat it because the steammed bun was so soft all the toppings kept falling out with every bite. It was annoying. I think I can get a much better one on the street for less. However they do have a cute concept and lots of other carnival items that probably is very good. Too bad I don't think I'll be back. I can't afford ab $8 hotdog it's a bit stepped for me but ill give everything a try once. Clean place and neat idea. But didn't do much for me. I would try their poutine if I am back."}
{"text":"Came in to see if we could use the washroom for my nine-year-old daughter. Was told \"sorry, it's for customers only.\" Glad to see customer service is a priority here."}
{"text":"This was my first time stopping by, as it had come highly recommended.   Immediately, the man working behind the counter was warm and friendly, and completely inviting, letting us know which toppings were being offered, and what his personal recommendations were.   We ordered the pulled pork hot dog, and the Korean beef-ribs hotdog, and both were extremely well done. The kimchi on the Korean beef rib dog was an awesome kick of flavour.  We split the fries, and later we were treated to the amazing in-house donuts. Even though we were both full from generous proportions, we could still make room for these. They are fantastic - and freshly made! They practically melt in your mouth.  The food was great - everything was fresh and the place is spic and span. Above all else, the excellent customer service was what will bring us back, and make us recommend the place to our friends. It was amazing, and much appreciated. The friendly staff make this a neighbourhood gem, and service like that makes everything top notch!"}
{"text":"We are very glad we didn't read the negative reviews before deciding to have a quick dinner here before helping our son move.   Fancy Franks was a pleasant surprise. We were greeted with warmth and enthusiasm on our arrival. In a city where customer service is on a pretty steep decline, especially in the restaurant business, this earned them quick points for a great first impression.   The menu was pretty expansive but the 4 of us decided on 4 different specialty dogs. Once we had all decided on steamed regular buns, each of us addressed by name and with respect, we sat and watched both patrons and staff. Regulars greeted by name, new customers walked through the menu, families enjoying the food and atmosphere.   We were served quickly. As I rose from my seat to get the food at the counter, I was waved back and the food brought to us.   The fries were perfect (and I'm picky about my fries!!) ... Now the dogs. I had the Frankie goes to Buffalo - I missed the part of the description that said it was a planko fried wiener and I'm glad I did!  I might have passed on this amazing creation. The crust on the dog was thin and crisp. As were the carrots and celery. A perfect and creative combination.  Wouldn't change a thing.   Davey had the Chi-Town Fancy, a spin on the Chicago style. The bun was perfect, plenty of toppings and the hot dog cooked well.  The celery salt rounded all the flavours out perfectly. He claims he will get the same thing next time which usually indicates its a hit!  Jake and Tori had the Coney Island and the Frankathenapolis.  Loads of great chili on the Coney and plentiful fresh toppings with a Greek flare on the Frankethenopolis made for two happy campers.    The sample of the fresh donuts brought to us with a smile to round out our meal left us in just the right place.  Might I say ... YUMM!!!!!!!!    Did the hot dogs cost more than those on a cart? Sure they did.  But let's face it, we are talking about two different experiences.  A restaurant with staff and overhead can't be expected to charge what those in a portable cart can charge.    We will return and we would encourage you NOT to give this place a pass."}
{"text":"Had to give this place a try after hearing how great it was from a friend. It did not disappoint!  Had the \"Franky goes to buffalo\". Delicious. That deep fried Panko breaded hot dog is a must try! The poutine was also good, melted cheese curds and delicious gravy, yum. Also had a mini donut, on the house, super tastey!  This place is a must try, comfort food done right!"}
{"text":"Stopped off for lunch with my wife and 2 year olds. My wife had the 90210 dog and I had the Chi dog. We got a junior frank for the kids with fries and a chocolate shake. Everyone including myself enjoyed the meal. We were surprised when the manager offered us complimentary donuts which was a big bonus. The place is well designed and very clean. We will definitely be back. Nice to see a great place like this set up in BloorCourt."}
{"text":"This place really didn't live up to expectations.  I feel kind of silly for paying $12 for a hotdog. I ordered the francophone and went to sit down and wait while it was made--I was called up about 10 minutes later when it was ready... The 3 different types of \"gourmet cheese\" were cold/unmelted, was never asked if I wanted any toppings or condiments on it--so it was basically just a $12 hotdog topped with cold shredded cheese."}
{"text":"Ok seriously now, fancy hotdogs ?!?!  Ok seriously now, tried em, LoVeD em !!!  Fries with fried eggs AND BaCoN sooooooo good !!! Only problem is it's going to take me forever to try all the different combinations . . . Mmmmmmm hot dogs"}
{"text":"We stumbled by Fancy Franks during their first few days open and it was a happy discovery. I hadn't heard anything about this new joint before, but having had gourmet hot dogs in the U.S., I think this is a good entry to the scene.  Fancy Franks has a host of interesting gourmet hot dogs \"flavours\" and tons of great, fresh-looking toppings. It's not as cheap as street meat, but then again you can tell why from the quality of the ingredients they use.   The buns are from Silverstein's, the franks have good flavour and a satisfying snap while the toppings were tasty and relatively abundant. I chose the Franks Got Seoul (yummy bulgogi, though kimchi wasn't too spicy) and my partner ordered the Southern Fancy (nicely spiced pulled pork and fresh coleslaw). We added an order of fries, which were a bit soggy, but a good enough size for the two of us. Vanilla milkshake was great.  We arrived after six pm and there were already a bunch of young families and 20somethings enjoying dinner perched on the shop's stools. There's one long, high communal table in the middle of the shop as well space against the front window.   Two little dudes eating dinner with their mom had the best exchange:   Little Guy 1: \"That was a pretty good hot dog.\" Little Guy 2: \"These buns were pretty good at falling apart.\"  And you know, it was so true. These dogs are MESSY! The buns are sturdy, but they do tend to split completely in half at the joint/bend due to the weight of the toppings.   Fancy Franks still has to work out some opening kinks (e.g. service workflow and that disappointing fact that they didn't have doughnuts yet!). Will have to check it out again to try those doughnuts and a completely different dog!  Notes:  They offer a choice of regular or whole wheat buns. I believe any dog on the menu can be made with a regular frank, a sausage or a veggie dog."}
{"text":"Tasted good but when you come home... What the heck did they serve us? I thought this place would be a staple since we live just around the corner but there will be a big X on the place as in NOT for us. Try at your own risk."}
{"text":"Let's put it this way.  The sausage that I bought from no frills is better than this place.  Wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Large selection, good pricing. Reminds me of Smoke's poutinerie. Tried their sausages, was very impressed. The service was extremely fast and friendly. Plenty of room to sit, and I found a random Pokemon card. Try the Chorizo!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service. The manager/supervisor working was lovely and accommodating. He made sure our 15 month old had a high chair (high enough for tall tables, bonus points!), and gave us some donuts to sample.   Had plain frank with pickles & ketchup, steamie with avocado & tomato, and the frank'n'beans. The only thing that would've made it more user-friendly is to make all do-it-yourself toppings free and make up for it with the pricey gourmet topping'd dogs. It's confusing to be asked what you want on a hot dog and then be told, \"you can't have that, it's extra\". She did it anywayy, which is nice, but we're so used to Subways and Chipotles, that having to pay extra for something laid out for you is a little disconcerting.    All in all, it was a good hot dog. Although I agree it's pricey, it is 1) handmade and 2) \"gourmet\" so.... take it or leave it. The soup was handmade and really delicious.   Nice atmosphere. Staff handled a lunch rush with pretty good grace. Cook had it all figured out. They were even training someone when we were there.    Would go back, for sure!"}
{"text":"In my mission to sample every fast-ish food joint on the whole of College Street we ended up here on a balmy Thursday night in November.  As is usually the case, the first thing that has pulled pork in it I tend to try and here was no exception with the SOUTHERN FANCY 100 per cent beef hot dog featuring BBQ Pulled Pork as well as cabbage slaw.  They give you the option to have the bun either toasted or steamed and when it comes to you is presented in a basket.  The hot dog itself was very good but for the $8 price it simply wasn't large enough, you'd have to buy fries or a poutine and it would end up pushing the price well over $10. (this likely explains why it's usually empty every time I walk past).  Verdict: Tasty but too pricey - go to The Little Dog further down College!"}
{"text":"Went here as I'm a lover of hotdogs, was so happy to find out that a place like this existed in the city. Took my sister for lunch, we ordered a plain ol frank, a frankaphone, 2 poutines and 2 fountain drinks. It was $30, ouch!! I figure I won't be eating here on a regular basis so it's ok so splurge every now and again. While waiting for our food 2 people ahead of us brought their food back with separate complaints (one girl was given a regular hot dog when she ordered a veggie dog - a big no no). We finally got our food just in time as a long line was forming. Our hotdogs themselves were great, one of the best I've eaten but the toppings - mine has so much mayo I had to dump it off in globs. The cheese was just there tasteless. Our poutines were good however, everything you'd want in a poutine, nicely cut fries, beef gravy and cheese curds. Overall amazing hot dog but I probably won't return."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, the place is pricey however the service and the food was outstanding.  I had the Coney Island dog, my little one had the plain ol frank. Side of poutine with a Pepsi and a chocolate milk...$22.01 later.  The dogs are %100 beef with lamb casing.   My little one wasn't crazy about the dog casing but she enjoyed it nonetheless.   The poutine was outstanding!   The manager came over and ensured that we were enjoying our meal and that everything was to our satisfaction.  He even gave us some mini donuts with chocolate and strawberries for us to try.  I saw some negative reviews about this place, but I really enjoyed the food and the service.  The only downside is the price."}
{"text":"Fancy Franks is what Toronto needs, a shop that has a diner feel serving classics such milkshakes, mini donuts, poutine and chilli, while giving us hip gourmet toppings on our hot dogs that we want today. As mentioned on Fancy Frank's website, \"Come taste the hot dog of tomorrow\"  I stopped by on a weekday afternoon and there was a constant flow of business. The location was amazing, close to Kensington market, Chinatown and the University of Toronto.   It was nice to see that the restaurant was family friendly. I met a father and son who were reading some children books that were supplied by the restaurant, with all books related to hot dogs of course!  My top 3 picks:  1. The Frankaphone, which had smoked gruyere cheese, horseradish cheddar, squeaky curds and a honey Dijon mayo. This dog definitely felt gourmet! The cheese melted so perfectly on the dog and provided the right amount of saltiness.  2. The FFGHD TX which had cajin spiced grilled onions, chedder cheese, BBQ sauce and chipotle mayo. It was a nice combination of sweetness with a nice tang from the sauces.  3. The Po-Boy Gets Fancy which had panko fried shrimp, lettuce, horseradish mayo, and hot sauce. Who doesn't like a po-boy? It was delicious.  There are TONS of toppings for customers to choose from to make their dog extra special. There was also a vegetarian Frank and sausages if requested.  Now what made the hot dogs stand out for me?  It was the quality of the ingredients. The 100% beef dogs with natural lamb casing had a nice snap when biting into them. Even with toppings such as cheese and meat, the flavourings never overpowered the hot dog.  The hot dogs shined in each one. Even after eating so much, I felt great and energetic!  The mini donuts are a must. They are created fresh daily and are SO cute!  Theirs is something for everyone, come taste a great quality gourmet hot dog!"}
{"text":"As mentioned in my about me. I cook like a maniac. Although semi decent and original concept dogs, my choice was done wrong IMO   Tried this out last night, had what was basically an eggs Benny hot dog, it could have been more enjoyable had it been constructed better. The eggs were draped over the top of the dog and bun, which in turn essentially exploded yolk all over my hands, eliminating what could have been the unique flavouring of a hot dog, hollandaise and eggs. Had the eggs been on the bottom in the bun with the dog on top and sauce over it. It definitely could have been a more enjoyable experience, where the yolk and sauce absorbed more into the bun instead of your hand.   And for the cost paid, I felt the hot dog could have been slightly larger in size. Was not filling enough for a snack, I ended up grabbing a pizza slice to top up about 45 minutes later haha  Been there once, dunno in ill give it another chance"}
{"text":"Fancy hot dogs for sure * I've been here twice and have never been disappointed. It is a bit pricey, but the hot dogs have good flavours and have TONS of toppings   Make sure to try the Nutella biscotti donuts * they are fresh and taste great.  Apparently the veggie dogs are really good as well   Good eats! RicksGoodEats.com"}
{"text":"This place is legit. I went for a Chicago style dog and they delivered 110%. The dog had a perfect \"pop\" when you bite into it (essential) and tasted just like it does in the states but with better tactics. The sports peppers are thinly chopped, which are the main difference. Other than that. Everything else tastes exactly the same. Spot on!"}
{"text":"I work just down the street. It was a good new spot to try from my normal China-town routine.  The place was empty when I arrived at 11:40am, and stayed pretty empty for the next hour. It's decorated with a little gastro-pub feel. you order at the counter and wait for ur food.  I got the \"Frank's got seoul\", and my friend got \"Frank goes to buffalo\". To be honest, it looked better than it tasted. Mine was a bit dry, and the ingredients didn't work that well together. My friend's dog was deep fried in batter. It tasted better than mine (more saucy), but the veggie sticks on top kept falling off.   I got a combo with a glass bottle pepsi (pretty cool) and fries. The fries was delicious, I saw them cutting fresh potatoes in the back with the pressing machine.  However, the combo came to $15. Pretty pricey for just hotdogs if you think about it, especially for the area.   I don't think I'll go back especially for anything. I don't have a craving for anything particular. We did try their tiny donuts though, it was pretty tasty. Maybe come back for a snack after work?"}
{"text":"I wandered into Fancy Franks with the intent to get a hot dog (naturally enough), but after deciding $9+ was too much for a simple work lunch, I opted to grab a bowl of soup to go.  I've had a lot of super salty food in my life, but that salt factor usually at least contributes something GOOD to the flavor to offset your imminent death.  I can't speak as to the rest of their menu, but their broccoli cheddar soup is essentially a bowl of cheddar-flavoured saltwater with a few florets thrown in to justify the name.  It was just plain difficult to eat."}
{"text":"Delicious option when you want a cheat day!!  They were very nice and gave us free donuts for dessert to!"}
{"text":"The staff must me treated right, as it shows through their costumer service. Always friendly and really great with the kids that come in with the families. The hot dogs are always delicious too! I hope the owner reads this, and let's the staff know that their hard work shows!"}
{"text":"Finally stopped by for a few hot dogs and what a nice surprise. Steamed buns freashly made corned dogs and poutine that would make any Montrealer feel at home. Also try the mini doughnuts freshly made and delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome place for a tasty hot dog. Some of the combinations area wild but if your into trying new food this is xfinity the place to go"}
{"text":"Came here for a poutine today but hot dogs menu looks pretty extensive and creative!  A casual place fashioned akin to a burger joint. The walls are lined with single seat bar seatings, plus a large communal table to one side that can fit roughly 16 people sectioned in half by a red trowel holding various condiment bottles.   Milkshake appears to be mixed with fresh milk with zero freezerburn. You might argue that it's something that should never be expected anyway, but it's a pretty good indicator considering it's currently dead of winter.   Fries are cut not too thick nor thin, the perfect medium for the audibly squeaky curds and salty brown gravy which is thick enough to coat the fries without being goopy. A veggie gravy is also available, if that's your Fancy (wakaka, see what I did there?). Will have to come back to try the hot dogs sometime..."}
{"text":"Options for vegetarians and vegans brought us in. The staff are extremely kind and hard-working.  For what this business is, they are doing an amazing job!"}
{"text":"Oh wow. This place blew my mind last night.  We had just left Cameron's house and we're debating between burger priest across the street or McDonald's up the road. As we walked up a bit we saw Franks and we just said it's a good middle choice for fries and hot dogs.  It's far beyond a middle choice! It's the best choice !  The amount of options they have for poutine and hot dogs are amazing!  And it actually tasted absolutely scrumptious."}
{"text":"This place wins!!!! Awesome food! Awesome staff!!! The buns are perfect and the dogs are all you think they would be! The steamies and hickory sticks are a nice touch for sure!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big lover of hotdogs but this place got me!  I went here with a friend of mine and we were both over-whelmed with the extensive menu. Everything sounded amazing, while my Canadian friend opted for the most bland option, I chose the Southwestern. I had the girl at cash recommend something since that's always gotten me good results. The place itself is not very large but comfy and cosy.   My friend loved her hotdog but men was waaay better, it was a hotdog with pulled pork and coleslaw. Superb! We ended the meal with half a dozen of their mini-donuts (3 cinnamon sugar and 3 lemon curd) these are amazing when eaten fresh. Also their size didn't make me feel too guilty :)  Will definitely be going again! Fancy fancy hotdogs!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chili dog with onions.   The ground beef + onion combination was alright but that was an awful, awful hot dog. I would have been better off buying a street hot dog.  The hot dog itself was dry and most rubbery I've ever had anything. I couldn't fully chew through it and ended up giving up halfway (the portions aren't even that big) because it was just not worth the effort to eat it. Definitely not worth the price tag at all.  Otherwise the store itself is nice and clean with decent decor. Really awkward placement for a menu (its on a side wall at the far back or the restaurant in chalk.) Staff was friendly and the food took a little bit long but not unreasonably so."}
{"text":"Nice place to get out of the rain & grab a dog which was what I did. They serve other popular snacks like burgers, poutine, milkshakes & doughnuts.  Tried the Franko y Huevos dog which came out hot & spicy just how it should be. It's a fall apart type of dog because the bun is super soft, definitely need plenty of nappies. Sautéed onions, peppers, chorizo & scrambled eggs with the sriracha added to the dog was tasty enough without needing any further condiments.  Wish they could just use a different kind of bun that can hold it together better."}
{"text":"Entièrement dédié aux hot dogs, cet établissement ouvert tard le soir vous permet d'éponger les nombreuses pintes prises dans Kensignton Market. Le principe est simple, commandez le hot dog de votre choix, donnez votre nom puis quand vous appelle donnez les assortiments désirés sur le fameux hot dog. C'est rapide, pas cher et souriant !  //Entirely dedicated to hot dogs, Fancy Franks is a good solution after having a couple of pints in Kensington market. Concept is quite simple, order your hot dog, give your name and when you come to pick up your prize, ask for the desired sides and sauces. It's quick, cheap and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to try Fancy Franks today and I'm a fan.  I had the Coney Dog and loved every bite.  Nice spice in the chill, not too hot, not too mild.  Took it to go and managed to eat it in my car without getting wearing any of it, which was a pretty amazing feat considering the toppings were piled on. My only suggestion would be for lots of napkins in the take out bag."}
{"text":"Fancy Franks is quiet fancy indeed.  The interior is pretty chill and casual, but those hotdogs tho - they are amazing. Lots of different options to pick from with all sorts of different toppings or build your own!   If you like hotdogs, you cannot go wrong with coming to Fancy Franks!"}
{"text":"Wow, I am honestly shocked this place is rated so low. Besides that, My friend and I swung by this place late after an event to grab some snacks, and Eric served us with a giant smile, and was super helpful in terms of giving us suggestions, tips, and information about the shop. We had the hotdog with eggs (which were perfectly cooked over easy), and cajun fries (could that basket get any bigger?!) with the nutella biscott donuts on the side (I saved two for my husband, he wad in love). The place was incredibly clean, and the staff even handled drunk, unruly customers that came in, just as normal (I'm sure they're used to it, it's college.) I have nothing but great things to say about Eric and the food that was served. I am an immediate fan and can't wait to bring my husband here to try all of the other franks (I have my eye on the pulled pork one, obviously)."}
{"text":"Fancy hot dog you say?  Does that oxymoron even make any sense?  Well I thought I would put it to the test as I can say I've had some of the best hot dogs this universe has to offer.  When you're dropping $8 on a dog, you don't want some greasy schneiders hot dog stuffed into a pair of buns.  You want something mouth watering and an experience that brings you back to your days at the ballpark, CNE, or when your grandmother used to fry you up a dog to go with your ramen noodles.  Why because we ghetto like that.  Anyway, this place looks great inside and the decor is definitely that out of a higher end restaurant.  The food however, was not as mind blowing as I would expect for the price I paid.  I picked up a Coney Island along with a few dozen nutella and original donuts on the side.  I'm fancy like that.  The dog was delicious and juicy, it made my eyes half roll to the back of my head.  The toppings however were pretty basic, and compared to a dog you can get from a street vendor, the quality was about the same.  The donuts were good, they weren't hot off the press krispy kreme good, but they tasted like your typical carnival donut from Tiny Tims.  Would I go back?  Sure why not, I love hot dogs and this place has a plethora of choices to choose from.  I think at one point I was staring so hard at the menu that I blacked out a bit and thought about how they make seedless watermelons, seedless.  Knowmsayin?"}
{"text":"Always pass by this gourmet hotdog place on queen street and finally decided to look in and check out their menu. Cashier was helpful in listing the popular buys, the options were loaded with a variety of toppings. Ended up going with \"fancy 90210\" which had avocados, tomatoes and bacon bits. Price ranged from about 7-$10, which are a little bit pricey in my opinion. Also got the Cajun fries which were good and flavourful, but not the best I've tried. I would say this place is pretty average, if you're craving hotdogs, I would still choose your typical street meat hotdogs over this place (which are cheaper too!)"}
{"text":"I had the Po Boy, it was good, but not anything like the po boy I had in New Orleans.  I think this place has potential, it hits a popular price point and there fore very affordable. This will be a place to watch.. it could take off.  You would think they would have had a Montreal Classic on the menu but no suck luck. Shame on them for not cashing in on a one hundred year tradition."}
{"text":"Fairly new store, nice pleasant and welcoming when you walk in.  Looks like an interesting concept. For what it is, a hot dog, seems pricey.  You don't just get a hot dog, you are buying into an original concept, I guess that makes it reasonable.  Everything seems well  thought out except they seem to have forgot the Canadian story. I would say at least 50% of Canadians have had and enjoyed the basic steamie all dressed and they don't offer that version here. If you are looking for cheap and cheerful, try Little Dog down the street."}
{"text":"Fancy Franks has some of the best hotdogs I have ever had. I went there today and testedx it out and was extremely full and satisfied. I had the original (the Franks Coney Island), a poutine and a dozen mini donuts. It was all delicious. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great hotdog options and service. Got a free doughnuts too overall it was a great time"}
{"text":"This place was decent.  The milkshakes were a tad \"watery\" but the donuts we ordered were made right on the spot and sinfully delicious.  Possibly a little too doughy but we were hungover and starving so they were perfect.  Didn't try their other food, but the place smelled good and the decor was cool.  I'd go back maybe."}
{"text":"Fancy Franks has THE BEST sausages in town. Its ridiculously good....it'll bring tears to your eyes. The casing has the perfect texture and snap when you bite down, the flavour overall is delicious. Plus they have an enormous amount of toppings! Today i tried the honey dijon mayo, oh my word! its amazing!   Now their poutine......oh my goodness, where do i begin? Its seriously amazing. They have the best gravy ive tried in a long time. The fries are perfection, this poutine rocks. plus the portion is massive.   I highly recommend this place. I'd eat here every day if my body would allow it."}
{"text":"I saw this place on \"You Gotta Eat Here\" and thought that I gotta  eat there.  However, it wasn't great. I had the Franks Got Seoul hit dog ($9.00) and regular poutine ($6.50).  The hot dog bun was very soggy  (I guess from the kim chee). The actual hot dog and the bun were the same  kind that many hot dog karts have. So, nothing special about it except the price.  The Korean part (kim chee and beef ribs) were ok.  The poutine, on the other hand was very good and it was a pretty good portion. The poutine makes it 3 stars. Without poutine, it's a 2.  I would not go out my way to eat there."}
{"text":"Hm. It was an interesting experience. I love me a good sausage (har, har) and I couldn't wait to try this place out. The service was friendly and relatively fast and efficient. I had the Franks Got Seoul dog that came with Korean short ribs, kimchi, sesame and scallion. I got them to hold the kimchi and replaced with sauerkraut though as I'm really not a fan of kimchi, but I really wanted that kalbi. It was good - there was a lot of toppings on it - I definitely got my meat cravings satisfied. However, I can't say that the kalbi was really distinctive enough for me to definitively say that that's what it actually tasted like. It just tasted like marinated meat. We also got a regular poutine to share. It was yummy in the beginning, but got way too salty very quickly. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had gotten a Fancy 90210 that comes with avocado and tomato (and bacon!) which may have cut down the salt a bit and added that hint of healthy eating.   Who am I kidding?? I'm having a loaded hot dog! I'll just have to drink extra water and walk an extra, extra, extra steps to work it all off."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Fancy Franks because how could a done up hot dog be bad.. The menu is pretty cool, very good selection BUT.... Yes there is a but..  The hot dog was not what I was expecting , it reminded me of a sausage/hot dog mix and the casing on the dog was much too chewy for my liking.  Peanut butter & Jam is impossible to mess up so it helped to mask the odd hot dog experience I had. I finished the hotdog and still had half a generic dry bun left lol. All in all, I would probably not go back :( it was worth a try though!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick bite on a Friday evening. The restaurant has a large selection of Frankfurt's. There is a good number of topping you can add to your meal. The price is a little high for a Hotdog, but it was damn good."}
{"text":"When it first opened the donut machine wasn't working and now it does but it takes forever to get a dozen made, so if you want donuts order them via the telephone then go pick them up. As for the hot dogs; ya creat selection but way over priced. The poutine is what I come in for every now and then. The staff are nice. The store is clean."}
{"text":"There are other way better hot dog joints in town. I had the Coney Island and the casing of the hot dog was too hard for me to bite through. That led to a very messy lunch and I must have gone through 15 napkins. My friend and I also tried the cajun fries and there wasn't much cajun about them. They had little to no spice and to be honest, the experience was so underwhelming I think I'm done composing this review. On a positive note, they put a boatload of chili on that hot dog, so they don't skimp. But what's good about having a ton of food you don't truly enjoy?"}
{"text":"Had a Coney Island... tasted just like Detroit! But two hot dogs, a poutine, and two cokes would not cost you 30 bucks in the Motor City. Was more of a snack (2 of us) as I left hungry. Poutine was good!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Both times the food was good but damn...it's pricey. On my second visit I paid $7.35 after tax for a corn dog. It was big, sure, but...I dunno, between country fairs and the many street meat vendors in town, I guess I'm just not used to paying so much for a dog.  The place itself is nice enough. No loud music. No TVs. Lots of storefront seating. No complaints."}
{"text":"It was pretty nice. Good tasting hot dog. A little on the pricey side. Poutine was really good. Good service overall."}
{"text":"Been there twice and expecting something spectacular the second time but left feeling unsatisfied.  I've had the Seoul and Po'boy and wished both times that the hot dog was better in quality. To be honest, I could've done without the hot dog. Got the fries as well this time and they were just okay. Felt a little disappointed that they were not as crispy as I would've like them to be and majority of them were short, like left over fries.  The service was decent and welcoming but the menu was overwhelming and kind of felt rushed to order. Totally missed out on the poutine menu on the left side. They should've had the menu board organized so that the sides are on the right for flow. I was also a little confused about the drinks because they had bottled sodas in a fridge and only found out later that they had a self serving soda dispenser.  Seating is limited and not ideal for a large group. Majority of the seating are bar style seating. There are some two seated tables along one side.  Would've given 3 stars but disappointing food and confusing menu brought it down to 2. I wish it was better, something like Japadog in Vancouver."}
{"text":"To be honest, I'm not really a fan of hotdogs. Processed meats are usually a turn-off for me. Despite that, I am a huge foodie and after hearing about Fancy Franks, I couldn't resist myself from trying out these so-called \"gourmet hotdogs\". My friend and I shared the Fancy 90210, Frankie Goes To Buffalo, and Lemon Curd & Powdered Sugar + Cinnamon Sugar Mini Donuts.   Fancy 90210 was \"nice\". I'll give it that. But then again, fresh avocados and tomatoes on anything is nice! The hotdog tasted good but I think you know where I'm going with this one - I didn't feel this was too special. Frankie Goes To Buffalo however, was an interesting twist that I feel rightfully deserves its \"gourmet\" claim. The outer crunchiness of the panko complemented the inner softness of the sausage and created a very satisfying mouthfeel that you normally don't get from hotdogs. The mini donuts were yummy. Nothing too special but the sizes were very appropriate considering it's just a side snack and you still have a main meal!  The one thing I really liked about this place is that you can customize your hotdog regardless of what you get and there is a wide selection of toppings! All in all, I would love to try all of the different items on their menu but the prices are a little deterring. Since it is just a hotdog after all, I probably wouldn't come back for its current price.   Also, I'd like to give a shoutout to Alexa, one of the employees, for being so cheerful and providing such awesome service."}
{"text":"Got a veggie dog with a whole mound of toppings. The veggie dog itself was good taste and consistency. The bread was more doughy/chewy than it was fluffy (I prefer the buns at Wurst).   I got the veggie dog to go, and by the time I ate it (about 7-10 mins later) the bread had already gotten soggy. I think ipart of the problem is that some of the condiments are soaked in water (like the lettuce). I think if I ate the hot dog right away though, that the soggy bun wouldn't have been an issue.  Try the chipotle sauce on your dog! Recommended by the guy behind the counter and totally a solid choice. Also, the hickory sticks were a win for me. Corn relish was nice too.   Smily service, clean and bright interior, and open later than a lot of other food places in the area. And for about $5 incl tax and tip? I say it might be worth a try if you're in the mood for a hot diggity dog."}
{"text":"Well they get points for the ambiance and decor... but the franks need not apply!  I will give them credit - the fries were great.  However, the franks - come on people - how can a fancy frank be boiled??? You need to grill that!  The topics were ok - but not any different than any street corners.  Fancy Franks - I think you can do better - use that impressive grill in the back and don't keep the hot dogs luke warm in a steel tray."}
{"text":"Don't.. Just don't. I came here expecting gourmet hot dogs (which in hindsight sounds like an oxymoron) and instead found barely boiled hot dogs on \"steamed\" (read: soggy, mushy) buns. The only saving grace here were the French fries, which when compared to the hot dog were surprisingly delicious. Moral of the story: you're better off (stomachs and wallets) sticking to Toronto street meat."}
{"text":"I was looking for some late night eats and came across Fancy Frank's. I was glad I stepped into the spot because that TX hot dog was great. The bread was nice and soft on the outside while toasty and crisp on he inside which was a very nice touch. Onions and the chipotle sauce along with the other ingredients made it a great hot dog."}
{"text":"I don't like fancy franks -- I'm pretty traditional with my hot dogs. However, if you like to dress yours up, you should definitely check this place out!  We stopped in here for a quick bite before heading over to a friend's birthday event. I have to say that the menu is quite impressive. As soon as I saw the poutine options though, no hot dog stood a chance!  I ended up getting a Fancy Schmancy (Korean Beef Ribs, Fried Eggs, Grilled Onions, Squeaky Curds, Gravy, Scallions) and just thinking about this is making me hungry! I just love egg yolks. And Korean beef ribs! And  cheese curds! And gravy! Yup, I definitely want more of this poutine.  The service was not the fastest, however, all these fancy components do take time to prepare. There is seating indoors which allows for a little people watching on the busy and hip Queen West.  Overall, this place is a solid 3 stars!"}
{"text":"The hot dogs at any Toronto Vendor are way better and cheaper- with better service as well.  I ordered the Buffalo hot dog and asked for it to be substituted with a chicken dog in place of the beef one. The cashier without issue processed my order, but the hot dog 'chef' (if you can call it that) and the condiment people made a huge fuss about my substitution. This isn't Terroni, there are no Hot Dog traditions, give me my chicken hot dog.  They gave in to my request but said they couldn't put all the condiments on the chicken dog that they would on the beef Buffalo dog. It was totally gross anyway, i don't even think the extra condiments would have saved it. $8.00 for a gross hot dog. If you want a hot dog with the works, bring some bacon and guacamole to your closest hotdog vendor, i promise you will enjoy it much more than Franks, and I just gave you an invisible Hot Dog Groupon to save $4.00"}
{"text":"Choices galore! Bad place for the indecisives...so much choices. Everything was good, solid late night, after drinking food option. The Cook to order, fresh donuts are to die for. Drunk nights finest. A drunken choice you won't regret... Prove there are some choices made after 2am that don't end in self loathing regrets (unless you're health conscious that is)..."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick lunch eat and I'm glad I did!  From the moment we entered, we were greeted with smiles. Not bad so far! The menu was all on the wall and It could be hard to read. I think the girl picked up on that and offered a paper version of the menu in front of the cash. Thankfully, that was easier to read! They had quite a bit of choices and they all made my mouth water a little bit. However, when I got to the Seattle my mouth watered instantly!  Of course the hot dogs were amazingly scrumptious! I would highly recommend more than one napkin for these hot dogs. The fixings were a good amount to for the size of the hot dog. There was good flavour in every bite! Just how I love it!  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Franky goes to Buffalo was just what I needed..  That Buffalo kick was the win and i felt like I was eating a chicken wing, but the panko dog mix was good. I want to try to Seoul dog and pbj the next time."}
{"text":"Awesome spot, had the fancy schmancy poutine and it was ahhmaaziing had all my fave things: scallions, a fried egg, Korean bbq rib, cheese curds, and gravy + they have donuts. The staff is beyond friendly and very helpful, I dropped my phone and it slid under their drink fridge the owner immediately told me not to worry and pushed the fridge over (it was pretty heavy) and got my phone. A+ food and A+ staff."}
{"text":"We were passing by, and the hot dogs aren't our favorite, but we decided to try the fresh made donuts. I ordered a dozen (a little expensive $6.00 a dozen, but whatever) I got the lemon curd ones, he centre of each mini donut is filled with lemon curd, then the donut is dusted in powdered sugar. The result was very good, not sure how good they would be once they cooled off, but we had them hot, it was really good."}
{"text":"WOW - gourmet hot dogs - right up my alley. The menu is amazing.....anything you can imagine on a hot dog, even something that resembles a JAPADOG !! The menu is pretty extensive and they have about 10 selections of poutine too !! Yummy"}
{"text":"I had some time to kill so the daughter and I checked out this place.    Oddly enough the hotdogs didn't peak my fancy nor the daughter's so we both had burgers.   I had the All American Double Cheese burger and the Daughter had the Bacon/Cheese burger.  I had onion rings.  The burger was ready quickly.  I added onions and the usual ketchup, mustard and relish.  The daughter had hickory sticks and blue cheese dressing.    I found my burger done to perfection and the burger was satisfying.  The onion rings were a nice but not generous portion.  They came with an dip that was complementary.  The daughter second guessed herself and ordered some fries and we had Doughnuts for dessert.    Personally I found the fries a little over cooked and not firm.  The daughter loved them as they were similar to old style fish & chip fries.  Then again the blue cheese dip helped with the taste.   The doughnuts were tasty but the price on Tiny Toms a la the CNE.  $6.00 for the dozen.  However unlike Tiny Toms these were bigger doughnuts.   The daughter could finish her burger so I had a bite.  I found her burger to be very dry.  I am not sure if it was the hickory sticks or the lack of other toppings (ex. Tomatoes or ketchup) but had that been my burger I would have give the place a 2.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"Toronto's answer to Chicago's Hot Doug's and New York's Crif Dogs; gourmet hot dogs with unique topping combinations that are bound to satisfy your cravings.  I went shortly after the lunch hour and customers were trickling in and out, little by little. The girl working the cash register did not look like she wanted to be there which was a bit off-putting when studying the menu and placing my order. I ordered the Franks Got Seoul and the cajun fries and was told they would call out my order when it was ready.  It was a standard size hot dog and the bun was lightly toasted. The hot dog was nice and juicy, the beef ribs was tangy and sweet, and the kimchi lacked the spice I was hoping for. It had the \"burrito effect\" where some bites I would just get the beef ribs, and other bites I would just get the hot dog. As for the cajun fries, it came i  n a large portion and they had a liberal amount of the seasoning and had a nice kick to it.  You Gotta Eat Here? It was between Fancy Franks and the nearby Clubhouse Sandwich Shop (which I'll check out next time). It's worth checking out for its novelty and the creative menu options. I was more satisfied with the cajun fries than the hot dog. I would come back to try their poutine as selections seems to be a bit more unique than Smoke's Poutinerie. Overall, it was a good (not great) meal."}
{"text":"After a stroll through Kensington Market, I remembered that this fancy hot dog place was close by and thus I forgot all about shopping and headed right over.  First Impressions, ample seating and nice decor  The service was incredibly friendly and patient with a newbie and they suggested the Frank's Got Seoul hot dog which is Korean Beef Ribs, and Kimchi on a hot dog with other toppings and sauces.  I will say it was very tasty, however, the hot dog seemed to get lost in all the other flavours.  Now in my opinion the absolute star of this place is their new nutella and crushed biscotti mini doughnuts. They even gave me 2 free to sample, which I quickly devoured and then ordered a half dozen like a true glutton.   I really enjoyed the service and the doughnuts were fantastic, I will be back to try some of the other hot dogs to see if they compliment rather than overpower the hot dog.  See pics for what I ate.  Yummy"}
{"text":"Great food, and good service. A little pricey but worth if."}
{"text":"Expensive but good. I pick the poutine over the hot dogs because it fills me up better. Great place for hotdogs"}
{"text":"You wouldn't think hot dogs can form a delicious gourmet meal, but Frank's manages to surprise and impress every time I visit. They have a diverse menu with loads of delicious options. I love the \"Frankie Goes to Buffalo\", a luxurious panko-battered and fried hot dog, topped with buffalo-style hot sauce, blue cheese dressing, turkey bacon, and a few carrot and celery slices. It's perfected, in the truest sense of the word, by the buns they use, which are fresh, steamed, and lightly toasted.  Not a fan of their fries and poutine, but the hotdogs are so filling with all of the toppings that I really don't think sides are necessary. Fountain drinks are reasonably priced and refillable, and there are glass coke bottles in a fridge if you prefer that.  However, their donuts are SPECTACULAR! These are mini donuts similar to those of Tiny Tom's fame, with various toppings/glazes available. Don't leave without a small box of them!  Service is excellent--staff are universally cheerful and friendly, happy to help with menu questions, and orders are ready pretty quickly. Prices are much higher than you'd expect for hot dogs, but the quality, the amount of delicious toppings, and how filling the food is, make the price reasonable in my opinion. They have a student discount, I think it's 10%--good for U of T students. You will eat VERY well here--I'm usually bursting full if I have a hotdog here for lunch, a hotdog with no side is even pretty much enough for dinner, maybe with a half dozen mini donuts for dessert."}
{"text":"The dogs were good but the burgers were delicious!!! I haven't had such an amazing burger in quite some time so this was definitely a treat!! The fresh beef and the deliciously crispy onion rings were perfection! I definitely loved the burgers and would be back next time for the burgers. My husband had the hotdog and a burger and he is a hotdog connesour but he love the burger so much more than the dog."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time on Saturday for lunch with my wife. I was very impressed with the service. The girl at the counter was friendly and informative. We both had a hot dog and thought it was great. The fresh cut fries poutine with cooked perfect and really nicely sauced. The hot dog had great flavour and the bun was soft and fresh. So we are happy. I was about to go up and order some of there fresh cooked doughnuts and before I could, the girl at the counter was making us free samples. This is great customer service. We would go back the next time we are in the area. I wish they had a location in the north end of the city."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group for lunch. Fancy Franks has some interesting selections of hot dogs; they are gourmet after all.   I got the southern fancy (BBQ pulled pork and cabbage slaw toppings over the hotdog). The BBQ pulled pork came out warm and not overly saucy. The pork was done well and not tough and dry. The coleslaw was chopped up making it easy to eat. It also added some crunch in every bite. The bun was nice and soft, and the dog was juicy. Their Cajun fries are also decent.  I will say though, the gourmet dogs are on the pricier side and you may not feel full having just one.   Nonetheless, our group had a good time here for lunch.   Shoutout to the owner/manager/employee (whoever you happen to be). He made us 2 baskets of fresh warm donuts on the house. This was a great gesture...he didn't know this but in our large group, a few were visiting Toronto for the first time from USA, so this added to their positive impression of the people and the city, and put us all in a food coma for the rest of the afternoon."}
{"text":"Specialty Hot Dogs.  There's really not much else to say here - obviously what they make is delicious, because it is hot dogs. And it fills a niche market that undoubtedly exists. It is also pricey for something that you can make for a couple bucks at home in less time than it takes to make kraft dinner.  All you have to do is math: you would otherwise buy Toronto streetmeat for 3 bucks (3.50 for a vegetarian, 4 for a sausage). At Frank's you can top that with Breaded Shrimp, Kimchi Noodles, Eggs and Bacon, et al. Sometimes, this will be a great idea. Is it at whatever point in time you happen to be at College in the Kensington district?  Last night my dog partner and I split a Po Boy vegetarian dog. It was a great idea. We did the math."}
{"text":"Omg the hot dogs are the best in Toronto I have too say the perfect hot dogs with a snap the chilly dogs are great also had the pull pork hot dogs all I can say is amazing and Poutine is not normal price is a Bit high $7 a hot dog and $9 a poutine but the food is great"}
{"text":"The food tasted really well. There's a huge selection of different hot dogs with varying toppings not to mention the wide assortment of poutines. I tried the Coney Dog that included the homemade chili, onions, and mustard, but I substituted the beef hot dog for a turkey sausage which made for a great combination.   I was still a little hungry and contemplated ordering the poutine but decided to keep it 'somewhat clean' so I ordered a beef hot dog without the bun. That's when it all went downhill from there. The grill man, who was also preparing the toppings on the hot dogs and was preparing the poutine with his hands, picked up the washroom key to hand to a customer and then proceeded to work WITHOUT replacing his gloves.   I'm sorry but I personally handle any washroom key with triple paper towel after washing my hands. This gentleman, who's the cook and food handler at this establishment, has a responsibilty to adhere to the most basic hygiene practices comsidering his role in a kitchen. But no, the clear gloves are just for show, touch the washroon key, then proceed to touch food with your hands as usual.  I seldomly write reviews, am typically very easy to satisfy, and am usually not phased by any sort of nonesense. But when it comes to health and hygiene, I'm sorry but there's no leniency in that regard. It's the most basic of human responsibilities, yet some just don't seem to get it.   Would've gave this establishment 4 stars, instead, I won't even return. And will pass the information to others if I were to be asked for their own information. Someone may say it's just one bad seed, so don't be so hard on the establishment. Maybe they'd be right, however, it takes only one bad seed to leave a bad taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"I am not a big hot dog/sausage fan but I would definitely come back! I like that they offer fresh ingredients and whole wheat buns. They offer your buns steamed or toasted, now how's that for fancy?  We ordered the Po Boy and the Southern hot dog along with a breakfast poutine. I probably wouldn't order the Po Boy again even tho the shrimps tasted really good it was just not easy to eat with my hotdog especially when I had it loaded with tons of veggies etc. If they made the shrimps into smaller bits then it would be better. The poutine was very good and the gravy wasn't too salty which I prefer.  They have yummy little donuts for dessert, I like the nutella and the cinnamon and sugar flavour!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice, I really enjoy their food. Yes it's kind of pricey for a hot dog. However they have a great variety/selection for everyone's flavour preference. There are different toppings you can add to your already loaded dog. Can get messy so make sure to grab lots of napkins. We tend to order a poutine along with our dogs, and they're all seasoned well - not too overpowering that makes you down a gallon of water. I knocked off a star due to the service being very on and off. I had to ask them if I got toppings added, they may not always ask you. So if you see something you want to be added let them know if they haven't offered it to you."}
{"text":"Went in here this morning and got a plain dog and donuts. The girl at the front---amazing!!! But I got my hotdog and was expecting an tasty hot hotdog instead I got a cold dog in a cold bun (untoasted). The bun was almost wet from the fridge??? The hotdog was cold inside. Terrible food. Won't be back maybe just for the mini donuts."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place! The options are endless, a little overwhelming at first but there's something for everyone here. The prices are high, but considering everything is from local Toronto businesses and the hot dogs are hand rolled, I don't really mind. The ingredients were fresh and hot. My boyfriend and I shared a poutine and a Fancy Francy.... Mmmmmmm. So good!  Ontop of the amazing food, the girl working was super friendly and helpful! Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"very meh. I got the greek hot dog with fancy ingredients like feta cheese tomatoes, peppers, and olives. The toppings were ok.. the cheese tasted a bit off, everything else was meh. The WORST part was the bun! SO STALE! How can you have a good hotdog without the bun being perfect??? I even ordered it \"steamed\" but honestly it was just crusty old bun, and I got a white bun! Which usually doesn't go stale as quickly. Anyway I don't know, I like that they have a veggie dog option but I can't see past the stale bun."}
{"text":"This place is fairly new (within the last two weeks). I wanted to go to Burger's Priest next door, but it was closed.   I ordered some sort of dog with avocado on it (I can't remember the name), and I was a little disappointed. Mainly with the size. It felt like a Shopsy's hot dog in a tiny bun. I guess for the money I paid I was expecting more. From that standpoint, the value isn't fantastic.   That being said, it was very good. I also ordered a fries, and they were tremendous. They'd give any fry truck a run for their money.   I'll probably return, but I'd try a sausage next time. Hopefully the value's better."}
{"text":"You've never tried a fancy hotdog and have whimsically held the thought in mind? Satisfy your need for novelty here. Otherwise, move along!   AMBIANCE + Clean, well-lit space. Two main areas of seating in this location 1) long communal table with high bar stools 2) a few bar stools facing the window (people-watching!)  SERVICE + Chipper cashier! Happily recommended his favourite (it was too much for me) and also provided a less-intense alternative (the 90201).   FOOD (Take-out!) +/- 90201 came with avocado, tomato, and bacon. It was decent - not something I'd come back for. Though, admittedly, I am curious about their other offerings. Overall, I can't see any reason to choose Fancy Franks over regular street meat (VALUE!!) other than the straight novelty."}
{"text":"My second trip to this location and I want to like it more because it's so close to home. Unfortunately, I can't. Lots of creative toppings for the dogs but the buns aren't up the the challenge and you just end up with a greasy, saucy mess on your hands. I literally couldn't eat these hot dogs as you are meant to - had to use a knife and fork. Also the poutine and toppings are weirdly flavourless. The poutine had tons of cheese and gravy, which I was happy to see, but ultimately ...not great. If you get avocado on your dog it's a pre-made mix of avocado and tomato that's clearly been prepped way too early and has been marinating for long enough that the flavours become indistinguishable.  Will note that the staff are very friendly and helpful. Just can't recommend the food."}
{"text":"The biggest problem you're going to have here is deciding what to order.  No joke, I would check their menu online and try and decide in advance, or you're going to be staring at their menu board for 10 minutes.  The dogs are great and all, and they do have some pretty creative toppings/names, but there certainly wasn't much to make me want to be a regular/come back often.  Also, when they say a hot dog comes \"with fries\", they don't mean on the side...(and that isn't a complaint)."}
{"text":"Frankie goes to Buffalo is definitely the star of the show here. Great place if you're not in the mood for street meat but have a hankering for hot dogs or poutine. The name says it all, various choices of toppings and styles or hotdogs making it \"fancy\". Poutines are good too. Only thing stopping me from giving a complete 5 star is the price. It is a bit pricy for a hot dog at the end of the day. Otherwise a great lunch spot in the area!"}
{"text":"Slow service. Terrible for a steam dog and just not inviting will stick to my hotdog guy on Bathurst and college"}
{"text":"Wow. So good! I have to say, putting seats in the window of the restaurant was a really smart idea because I walked by and NEEDED to have what those people were having! It looked like a hot dog covered in an entire omelet, and while I hate eggs and am not a hot dog enthusiast, it looked amazing and huge and I wanted. We couldn't find any food to agree on between the 3 of us, so one went to the place across the street and 2 of us went to Frank's.  Being from Buffalo I felt like I HAD to try the Buffalo themed dog. I'm not a hot sauce person but I thought it could have used a teenie bit more. Other than that- delicious! We were both amazed. I can't say I'll be back since there are millions of things to try in Toronto, but if you're on Queens West...yum!"}
{"text":"This is a good-enough concept. But, the execution is just underwhelming. I tried the southern fancy in store. The pulled pork and slaw were extremely bland. Then I ordered the spicy andouille sausage and Cajun fries on foodora. Again, everything was extremely bland. No spice or flavour at all. Note that I have a low tolerance for spicy food, but this was just tasteless. You're better off with a sausage or hot dog from a street vendor."}
{"text":"Saw the they were selling gourmet hot dogs. Went in to try one. It was just a hot dog. Nothing special. The sausage was thin and tasted just like any other hot dog sausage I've ever tasted. I've actually had better hot dogs from carts on the street. Very disappointing and expensive for nothing."}
{"text":"really overpriced (really 6.25 for a chili dog, come on it's not even bigger than streetmeat hotdogs), but admitedly delicious. don't go here on a date. it's messy."}
{"text":"This review is for the poutine and not anything else.  Ok...I've been here a few times and I'm hooked on the poutine.  I admit, when they pack it in it looks like alot, when you get home the fries get a little depoofed so it may look smaller but it's not bad for what you pay.  I like to get the fries unsalted, just a bit of gravy and it's really good!  I'm not a fan of the gravy by itself but a little bit is good.  I've only had the small hotdog which I liked (nothing fancy).  I'm not so sure about having so many 'gourmet' toppings on my hotdog but you should come here to try the poutine at least.  For about $6.50 it's not bad."}
{"text":"Hm. I guess I don't get it.   I didn't like this at all. My boyfriend didn't mind it, but he'll eat anything.  - too much bun. Too much bread.  - ingredients - pieces too big. Felt like an afterthought. 'lets make this a Greek hot dog Lets pile a Greek salad on top!\" for $7.00 - Big chunks of pasty, unripened tomatoes. GROSS.  - The mild sausage was dry. Wasn't great at all. (not worth the +$1 upgrade!) - The hotdog casing is really tough. I know nothing about hotdogs, but it was tough and required a lot of chewing.   Fries are ... fries?  Thin, shoestring fries. They come in a box-style. Lots of fries. crammed together.   They gave us 3 mini donuts to sample, which was a very nice gesture.  But I'd never order them.  They were obviously fried in oil not nearly hot enough. They weren't crispy or dry. They were moist and soggy.   In a nutshell ....  It's obvious that I just don't get it. The toppings and the regular ol' hot dog isn't mind blowing. The hotdog .. it's all such an afterthought. The toppings are too much IMO, and they just fall off, and then you get a mouth full of BUN and a bit of mediocre dog.  These toppings? Go to a good hotdog cart along Front Street, and you can get a most of these toppings, with a much bigger and better hotdog or sausage.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Do you like hotdogs? If yes, you need to come here and experience what Fancy Franks has to offer. Also, if you answered no.....you probably don't have a soul. While walking down Queen Street one of my friends saw this place and needed to give it a try and I was more then willing to come back for a second time. This was my second trip to Fancy Franks and I knew just what to expect, awesome hot dogs. I'm really boring and ordered just a plain hot dog (don't judge me) and as I expected, that hot dog was awesome. My friends were all super impressed by this place and talked about it even after we left. If you want hot dogs, come to Fancy Franks, it's as simple as that."}
{"text":"By Far one of my Favorite Places to go to! The Staff is Polite and The Food is Amazing! I always have my usual Grilled Cheese Poutine and Spicy Sausage and I'm never disappointed!   I will continue to go to Fancy Frank's once a week and will continue to recommend this place to Everyone!"}
{"text":"I like it alot cool looking place good food a little expensive for hot dogs but the sausage is amazing and so are the poutine I also really enjoy their chilli it's top notch great milkshakes as well"}
{"text":"Fancy Franks is good stop for a hot dog. They offer about 12-15 versions of toppings that serve to create a unique hot dog. The southern BBQ, Korean, and Frank's Coney Island are among my favourites.  They also do onion rings and donuts, both of which are delicious. Allow a little extra time if you order these.  Also note...  1. No credit cards, just cash or debit. 2. They could be more creative by offering elk or other healthier meats, yet do not. 3. They do a stamp card program where your 9th dog is free. 4. They don't do combos with any consistency. Sometimes they will offer one, yet not with any known reguIf you are really hungry and want onion rings, a fountain drink, and donuts with your dog, it could get pricey!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our gourmet hot dog today!  Service was fast and friendly. Good price and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hot dogs... most $7 + Tax.    The dogs are small :(  But they are somewhat generous with the toppings.  Not bad, but nothing special; I don't think it's value for money though.  LOTS of options you can add though, which is nice."}
{"text":"So I was walking past here, had seen the other location and wandered in. The decor is nice, it's a large place, huge communal table in the centre of the room (am sort of okay with this for a sorta fast food kinda way), friendly guy at the cash who greeted me right away. Clean, snazzy font, great signage, oh, along with tons of weiner choices and gobs of toppings - they have some interesting sounding doughnuts on the menu too (didn't realize until I came home and did some research that they're made in-house - too bad, would've def ordered them - the one with lemon curd sounds interesting).  I like how you get a choice of steamed weiner (yes) and steamed bun (why not) and whole wheat or reg bun options. My hot dog was tasty, I just chose horseradish mustard (has bite), relish, and sauerkraut. In hindsight, I should have added ketchup or tomatoes to balance out the kicky bite. Hot dog had the proper consistency and flavour. Service was friendly and quick. They have washrooms (a little hidden, you have to ask unless you're already in the know) whose hallway is on automatic sensor (yay) as well as in the individual washrooms themselves (yay again). Clean. Interesting menu. Will come back."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location. The service was great - super helpful (which we love)! I asked what was popular and what the guy recommended. He suggested the Frankie Goes To Buffalo (panko fried weiner). It was good, nice mix of textures, crunchy, chewy, spice with a bit of kick to it. Very flavourful. Love the varied menu. Clean funky washrooms. Wish it was a tad cheaper, but apart from that, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I am embarrassed this place exists in my neighbourhood.  I prefer the dwindling dollar stores and cash checking establishments to this abomination of a business.     The service is lovely and this is by no means a comment on them, however, if I could unilaterally close one business for good, it would be this one.     We were interested in visiting this place after it opened a couple of years (?) ago and after a very long time my husband and I stepped in tonight to share a hotdog.   I am having a hard time describing how disgusting my half hot dog experience was.   We ordered the Coney Island dog.  The hotdog itself was a steamed/boiled injustice to texture, taste and meat. The chilli was equally bad.  It was unappetizing from the first look and bite.    I imagine this is what prison food tastes like.  Redic we paid $10 for one S-t Ass hotdog.    Ps- the rodent/roach traps visible in the washrooms didn't do anything to change our perception.   Wish I had seen them before we ordered."}
{"text":"Great service, the food was good. I say good for myself because I hate hotdogs. And so you say, \"Then wth were you doing at a hot dog place??!!\" My boyfriend LA LA LOVES EM....so yea :) Haha, anyways... I got the Po' Boy gets Fancy and he got the Fancy Francine. They were both amazing, I loved the fact you could add extra toppings as you liked and THE DOUGHNUTS!!!! We got a half a dozen of nutella and half of the lemon. FREAKING AMAZING. I'll go back for the donuts, my boyfriend will go back for both haha."}
{"text":"Looking for a great dog place for ahwile...fancy franks did not dissapoint! Had the frankie goes to buffalo dog and it was an unconvensional masterpiece.   Friendly service and a nice environment.  I will definatly be coming back."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys across the street was the destination, just my luck they're laying cement for a new sidewalk. The whole block was closed! Hey look, there's a hot dog joint. I love hot diggities, looks like my luck is improving. At first I thought the prices were a little high for a hot dog, but they are loaded. The Coney Island is a go to for me and was one of the better I've had. They even have a pizza dog, if you're into that sort of thing. Didn't try the doughnuts or poutine. Did get a burger tho and damn, it was tasty. You order your basic burger then they fix it to your liking. I went with the classic; lettuce, onion and pickle. No tomatoes for me, but they looked fresh as did all the other toppings. The onion rings were tight too, nice little chipotle mayo on the side. Try a milk shake. Staff was very friendly, place was CLEAN. Good luck parking anywhere near this location. And don't forget, after the age of 7 you know longer get to put ketchup on a hot dog anymore."}
{"text":"After our late dinner, we decided to walk around the area. Ju wanted to stop in for some freshly made mini donuts and me being such a good friend, of course, obliged. We must have got there just before they were closing as one of the workers informed us that it was take out only.  - Cinammon sugar mini donuts ($3.00 half dozen) - Fancy FranksThese taste just like the mini donuts you get at the fair. I liked how they were hot and fresh out of the deep fryer. Not really my go to for late night snacks but I can see the appeal. At least it's cheap! Eat 'em while they're hot."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  For some strange reason, I was craving a hot dog on Christmas Eve after work, but I wanted something a bit gourmet instead of your typical streetmeat in many downtown intersections. A Yelp search found this place for me, and after reading the menu and reviews I decided to try it out.  This place is quite open concept, and the layout of the seats means you're sharing a large table with other customers. It's not a place where I would take my significant other or come in with a large group, but it's a place where I can grab a quick bite and expect quick, efficient service.  After looking at the menu board for a few minutes, I went with the Seattle Frank. I was in Seattle last year but never managed to try their hot dogs, so I figure a Seattle Frank would revisit my memories of what could've been a Seattle hot dog.  The hot dog was quite good! I'm not a huge fan of mustard and would probably order something without mustard next time, but the sausage itself was very juicy. For $7.50 the price is a little bit steep, but it's a gourmet hot dog so that's expected. I still had much better hot dogs at Japadog in Vancouver, but seeing how that's over in the west coast I'll settle with a place like this.  Service was excellent. The person who took my order is very energetic and made the whole ordering experience very enlightening. He also seemed like a nice boss, as both workers (who looked like university students) were having a great time making people's food.  I know there are a couple of other gourmet hot dog places nearby, but Fancy Franks looks like a place that temporarily fits the hole left behind of my awesome experience at Japadog during my west coast trip."}
{"text":"* Happy International Hot Dog Day * // July 23  Dropped in today to celebrate this festive occasion. Partnered with Sick Kids, there were sunglasses, pins, a live DJ, bottles of water, and hot dogs in exchange for donations. This isn't an everyday event, but it was a nice touch. After enjoying the 'plain hot dog,' I went inside to check out what else was on the menu. I was full so I ordered a box of strawberry jelly/sugar powder donuts (which are made on the spot) to take home. This place reminds me of Japadog's Canadian cousin - the menu has some really unique items. There was a PB & J dog, which I h o p e isn't a hot dog with peanut butter because that doesn't sound appetizing. I noticed a shredded pulled pork hot dog, which sounds like it would work. The decor inside is pretty 'hip' and aesthetically pleasing. It's a small space, but there are high chairs and tables available for you to eat at Fancy Franks. Anyway, can't wait to come back to check out their other hot dogs.  Good for: lunch, dinner, sweets"}
{"text":"Great fresh doughnuts, shakes, hot dogs for the Late night cravings!  The shakes don't have too much sugar which we liked. Try the hazelnut-chocolate mini donuts ."}
{"text":"Deciding to try this place since me and my friend were in the area and hungry. I'm not a fan on Hot Dogs so i ordered a poutine instead. It was very decent but I wouldn't really recommend getting a poutine here. I felt like it tasted bland and overpriced. Maybe the Hot Dogs are much better, but will not go here again to get a poutine"}
{"text":"I tried the Po'Boy hot dog. The hot dog itself was good. But the prices were a bit over priced."}
{"text":"Gourmet hotdogs.. what could that possibly be? My curiosity certainly got the best of me. Tried the Frankathenpolis which was a super long name. What felt like a tongue twister I placed my order as \"the Franka dog\". It is advertised as a gourmet hotdog but if you take out all the unique toppings that they give you the hot dog itself tasted just like any regular street dog  For $7 the hot dog that I ordered came with feta cheese, tomatoes, green olives, diced red + green peppers, olive oil, lemon juice, and my choice of other toppings. I ended up adding hickory sticks, corn, and celery + carrot sticks as well. Yes it's a weird combination but after all it's the Frankathenopolis so may as well go big or go home. You can think of it as a greek fusion hot dog.  There were around 10 types of sauces to choose from. The labels on the bottles were rubbing off so it was somewhat difficult to determine what each of the sauces were. Thankfully the service was great and they were patient with me deciding which sauce to choose from. In the end I settled with mayo and some kind of honey mustard :)  Overall I felt that the meat tasted standard and it was small, but in combination with those toppings I would say it tasted pretty good. It was served in a red plastic basket lined with a sheet of paper that says Fancy Franks. Inside the place is pretty clean. In terms of the seats there are some window seats facing Queen St. W so  it is always hustling and bustling with people and streetcars. The taste was average and not bad but the hotdog meat could be better. Overall I would say the hotdog itself = 2.5/5 but with the toppings it is 3/5"}
{"text":"Hot dog was \"okay\". Kind of place you try out once if you pass by it on Queen Street downtown but it's not going to be a repeat for me. Many street vendors offer a delicious dog for 4$ anytime you want one."}
{"text":"Great vibe and well run. Went with kids and each of us had a dog, shared an order of fries and an order of mini donuts. All of us left full and couldn't finish it all. Lots of variety to choose from and the manager came over 2-3 times to check on us. We'd definitely go back and we'd go a lot more if we lived closer!"}
{"text":"Avoid the over-hyped dogs; come for the tiny donuts!  I'll echo the familiar sentiments that the pricing is too expensive for what you get. The boyfriend and I ordered two hot dogs (no sausage upgrade or extra toppings, or sides or drinks) - our bill came out to just over $18.  For the price, we expected the dogs to be bigger - they weren't. They're about the size of the vacuum-sealed 8-pack of wieners you get in the supermarket. Wurst has similar pricing, but their sausages are literally twice the size/heft, and they have more meat choices.  The hot dogs were tasty, but the portions were seriously underwhelming. The $9 Frankaphone (topped with 3 kinds of fancy cheese) looked meager and tiny, which my boyfriend inhaled in seconds. I had the $7.50 Southern Fancy (topped with slaw and pulled pork) which was delicious, but I was still left hungry after finishing (which doesn't happen EVER.)  We decided to get desert, as we heard rave reviews about the hot and fresh mini donuts. We chose the Lemon Curd version (a dozen for $5.25) and it was worth EVERY. PENNY.  Comparable to Tiny Tom donuts, the lemon version has tiny bits of lemon flecks in the batter (but it's not overwhelming in taste) topped with the bright yellow lemon filling you see on lemon danishes and tarts. (The presentation still needs to be worked on, as the lemon topping looked like a spastic mess, and coated most of the box it came in.) We initially planned on taking these home, but ended up devouring them all in one sitting, because evidently, we have zero self-control.  You unfortunately can't mix and match different donuts in your dozen (there's also chocolate, strawberry, and plain sugar) but once you start eating these, you won't complain.  Will definitely be back for the tiny donuts! In the meantime, I'll try my luck for a good weenie at Little Dog Steamies further down on College."}
{"text":"Hot dogs are a great childhood memory for me.  Being brought up in an immigrant household, eating \"traditional Canadian food\" was a big treat from our daily rice and noodles that we grew up with and having hot dogs was one of them.  Walking down Queen Street West we saw Fancy Frank's and decided to try some fancy franks out:).   They had a variety of gourmet dogs but we settled on a Frank's Coney Island Dog and Franco Y Huevos to try out.  The Coney Dog was good with chili, cheese and onions over the hot dog.  The Franco Y Huevos was a chopped dog with jalapeño, tomatoes onions and eggs mixed all in onto the bun.  It was good but as a traditionalist I love my dogs whole so I can get that snap that an important part of all great hot dogs.  Overall the dogs were good but at its higher price point its not a stand out for what you get.   3/5."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch.  Two great dogs ... pulled pork and francophone (3 cheese).  Real good pouting too."}
{"text":"Fancy Franks indeed so fancy.  I was overwhelmed!  Took a long time before I picked something.  I had Coney Island dog, it was just ok.  I wish I got something else, like sausage or simple cheese dog instead.  I'm not very impressed with the hotdog. It was kinda skinny and could not taste it because too many things going on with it.  I really like the traditional poutine and donuts are must have!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, nice clean place with good music. Their open till 3 am ! Chill workers. Awesome atmosphere. Wait isn't longTry the Southern Fancy hot dog oh ya they got burgers too . Milkshake, donuts damn, just try it."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Fancy Franks.  You can read books about hot dogs as you eat your hot dog.  Seating is communal or you can sit by the window.  I ordered the Fancy-zza hot dog and a Diet Coke.  I've never had a non-basic hot dog before ... the only ones I've bought have been off a hot dog vendor on the street.  At $7.50, it was definitely more expensive than \"street meat\" but it was good.  The bun was super soft.  It tasted like a pizza burger on the top and a hot dog on the bottom.  I was still hungry so then I ordered six mini donuts dusted with cinnamon sugar ($3).  They were hot and freshly made and delicious."}
{"text":"Fancy hot dogs that cost $7-$10 has to be one of the most lucrative food trends out there.   The hot dog itself is nothing special. It was what a hot dog should taste like, and was fairly snappy. They're basically trying to copy other shops like Crif dogs / Japadog, but not nearly as good. The flavor combinations are fairly pedestrian/average. Not worth it for me."}
{"text":"If a burger is Batman, a hot dog is Robin so I'm not surprised to see a surge in hot dog joints as an offshoot of the current burger craze.  I was taking a rare drive along Bloor West and saw the Fancy Franks so I decided to pop in and grab a dog for road.  I figured while I was slumming I'd grab some donuts too.  These dogs have some Beverly Hillbilly prices.  Perhaps I'm spoiled with the ability to consume $1.50 coney dogs in Detroit, but I was a little shocked at the almost $8 price tag. That said, they did some justice to this important piece of Americana.  Holy powdered sugar, Batman! The donut machine wasn't working either!  All in all, an interesting novelty but I'd tend to still get my dog for 1/2 the price and the smiling street vendor down the road."}
{"text":"I had my reservations about trying this place. I was pleasantly surprised with the food. We arrived at noon on a workday and was surprised to find that it was not busy at all considering the location. I had the buffalo chicken frank with a turkey dog as a substitute. It was alittle salty but it was a nice sized hot dog for $7.75.   The bun was the winner of lunch for me. A soft bun with just the right consistency for repeated bites. It was tasty and reminded me of sour dough bread. I appreciated that the hot dog artist slight cut into the sausage for even cooking. It was dressed with all the traditional sides of buffalo chicken: carrots, celery and blue cheese plus I added some corn for good measure.   I liked that they have a wiener dog on the shop front display. It adds a nice touch. It was a clean environment with music. All the sides and toppings were displayed including the buns. Ah the wall of hot dog pictures gave it a nice feel."}
{"text":"Who's up for some fancy dawgs?!?!  Taking the ordinary hot dog n elevating it creatively is what set's this place a part from the old street meat on Queen and Spadina. I've been to this location specifically twice n the college location once. I must say, each time I'm here, I'm always super hungry. So what amazes me each and every time is the friendly staff n speedy service.  This time around I decided to try the porker poutine.  Oh Hawt Damnnnnnnnnnn. The greasiness of those fries soaked in gravy, squeaky curds, ground chorizo n bacon is mouth watering goodness. But you must save some room for half a dozen of their mini donuts. The nutella n crushed biscotti is so boss. They did not stand a chance even though I was super full.  Hands down, I would come back without a doubt"}
{"text":"Seriously - why would anyone pay close to $10 for a hotdog with stuff on it? I was not impressed at all - and hungry after.  I'm not a fan, but appreciate it's an addition to an area that lacks food."}
{"text":"Service was okay, food was okay. By the time my hotdog was ready it wasnt even hot. The cold cheddar thrown on top wasnt delightful either. Cute idea for a food spot but not sure id recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"VIBE  Cool retro murals and bright red colours against a wooden backdrop give something decidedly unfancy a fancy exterior. It works and it brings people in, right?  The staff are really nice.   WE ATE Smart idea: come up with different permutations of ingredients and themes to put on a hot dog or specialize in one thing, call it \"gourmet\" or \"fancy\" and mark it up a LOT. That's business in 2012!   We got the \"Frank's Got Seoul,\" the shop's Korean take on the hot dog. Braised ribs (more shredded) with kimchi and sesame seeds topped our frank. My friend LOVED it. I loved the kimchi but it was just too much protein. The dog on its own was very good.   I saw the poutine. It's a hefty portion.   I found out about the donuts too late. Next time!   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Uh, you fancy huh? Uh Uh. Good for a late night eat or if you're starving/craving a dog. No \"street meat\" here."}
{"text":"i enjoyed fancy franks. i thought the portion and price were okay, but i'm not a big eater.  the toppings are very creative, and of the ones i tried, worked really well together. the food came out quickly, but it wasn't busy when i went.   all-in-all it's a nice addition to college street and i'd certainly go there again if i had another hot dog craving."}
{"text":"Staffs really friendly and the hot dogs are delicious with like a million toppings to pick from!  Had the Franks got Seoul hot dog and it was totally delicious :)"}
{"text":"Love hot dogs or sausages, poutine, and milkshakes? Get your butt down here! This place offers a variety of options for all 3 categories!  I just wanted a snack and dropped in, ordered a Franko Y Huevos coz i was looking for a lil spice. So A) yes it was spicy B) pipping hot, that heat just enhanced the spicyness!. That isnt a negative, i was looking for spice and i got it. That Frank...was down right yummy!!! It was also packed that toppings would fall off. If anything i wished they had a sturdier bun that was big enough tl hold everything and no get too soggy as well. If i lived around the neighborhood I would definitely try everything on the menu. A customer infront of me told the staff that the poutine she ordered was for her BF as he was aiming to try every poutine they had and this order was the half way mark. Definitely a place to enjoy a hot dog!"}
{"text":"There's this young Spanish looking chick here- SHE MAKES THE MOST BOMB HOT DOGS OF LIFE!!! I wish I knew her name .. but I love going in there when she's there because I know I'm about to get a realllll good meal"}
{"text":"Finally, after months (maybe month...) of waiting, Fancy Franks is OPEN!  I've been eying this gem as it's been going up over the last month or so, and finallyyyy got to try it today!   Fancy Franks is a hot dog joint which also specializes in mini doughnuts (WTF AM I IN HEAVEN!!?), while I didn't try the doughnuts today, I did get to try two of their hot dogs, their fries and even got a cute little fountain drink!   This is definitely more of a lunch style place, with large bar seating (TIP: I really wish you would install coat hooks underneath). The decor is, I'm going to go with hot-dog chic, as one wall is covered in vintage hot-dog pics, and there is an old school counter where your toppings are added. They even have glass bottle pop (YAY!) but it is Pepsi (BOO!).   After taking a look at their wall menu, and then discovering their much easier to read paper menu, we ordered the California one (90210 something) and the pulled pork one (Southern something - obviously I'm good with names). You can choose between frank and sausage, as well as a variety of toppings and whole wheat or white buns. The southern frank was SO good - topped with pulled pork and delicious slaw, you can't really go wrong. The California one was good, but was a little dry (TIP: avocado salsa instead of avocado!). The fries come in a huge portion (definitely split-able) and were salty and delicious.   One thing to note, is that I didn't see a veggie option - not super surprising at a hot dog restaurant, but just a tip!   With 10-12 more hotdogs to try, as well as the mini doughnuts, and considering this is walking distance from work - Fancy Franks, I'll be seeing you!"}
{"text":"I'm really really liking this place. Not because food is amazing - even though it is, but the service there is HILARIOUS! I met the asian guy who was there... I forgot his name. But he was funny as hell. He was super dooper friendly and greeted me with so much energy. His energy radiates across the room and no one there, I took note, was sad or upset with the food or anything.   Sometimes, even when the food isn't the best, and when the service is amazing, the food doesn't seem to matter anymore. Nonetheless, I had the original Chicago Dog and it was so good! I found that I didn't like the bun (but that's a personal preference - I don't like eating much bread) but everything in the hot dog was delicious!  Would I come back? YES! Just for that server! (ok fine.. and the food)"}
{"text":"Dropped by this place after eating at Pokito because it was just across the street and I was looking for something that was hot and fresh.   Only shared a poutine with my buddy here, with bacon and egg to keep it simple.  Very casual place with stool seating.  I really liked the egg with my poutine and cheese curds were really good, but the one thing that turned me off was the fries itself.  I'm not sure why they tasted bitter, may have been because it was overcooked or something, but I just didn't have time to complain and have a new one made... or if that's how they're supposed to taste. (As you can see in the photos, the fries are pretty dark in colour)  Probably my first and last time here, I've definitely had better when Poutineville was still around."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend on a bright Sunday afternoon to grab a fun lunch. Fancy Frank's did not disappoint!  The staff was so friendly and super helpful when we asked for help in deciding what to order.  We decided on the loaded potato poutine which had bacon scallions sour cream cheddar cheese along with the gravy - stuff my dreams are made of! We devoured it.  I went with the coney island dog, loved the chilli, and loaded it up with condiments. My boyfriend had the Buffalo dog, he loved it.  We ended with mini Nutella and biscotti doughnuts and OH MY GOD, I would come back just for these alone. They are bakery quality and made so fresh. We were burning our mouths they were so good we couldn't wait.  We will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Wow this place was the joint! I have never seen such an amazing selection of hot dogs. They had everything imaginable for every hot dog fan on the planet.  I had the fancy Francine and it was fantastic! Thoroughly enjoyable, fun to eat (open wide!) and delicious to boot. I swear it's a good thing I don't live near this place because I'd weigh 700 pounds and it would all be hot dog weight.  I will definitely go back again when traveling to the area... as a matter of fact, I look forward to making it a staple as part of a trip to Toronto!"}
{"text":"This seemed like an appealing concept - who doesn't like a fancy hot dog with cool things on it? I've had some delicious ones in Minneapolis and a few winners elsewhere, too. Not so much these, though.   Part of the problem was the roll - huge, mushy, and sweet when it should have been lower in profile and more neutral flavored. The topping options seemed odd, and none of them made much kind of use that I could see of the great texture/flavor contrasts a good hot dog provides. They were also remarkably expensive for how not-great they were - any street cart in Toronto would sell you the same dog on the same bun for half the price, and you could doctor it yourself (not with short ribs, true, but still). It was hard to have paid $9 for a mediocre hot dog with cheese and think about how many hot dogs I could have bought at Costco, without cheese, for the same money. Poutine, same problem - overpriced and undistinguished.   The surprise winner of the visit was the mini doughnuts. $6.50 gets you a dozen mini Nutella doughnuts with biscotti crumbs, and those are the most expensive - the cinnamon sugar ones are $4.50 and also look very nice. The doughnuts tipped this from two stars to three, but if we'd just got doughnuts and nothing else I would have been happier."}
{"text":"Interesting hot dog choices. I got a plain one and built my own. They have a ton of free topping choices. I wish they had more types of mustard though. I mean, a hot dog place with dozens of styles of hot dog, but only yellow mustard? Come on."}
{"text":"Ambience and customer service is great. Food's pretty good too but not really amazing, which I was expecting it to be since it was on \"You Gotta Eat Here!\". Also, the portions could be slightly bigger for the price.  If I could summarize the food in two words they'd be, \"Overpriced Appetizer\"."}
{"text":"Fancy Franks is a win!  My first encounter with the tasty Fancies was at the Yelp 99 Sudbury event where we got to try the delicious Aano which featured prosciutto and arugula.  A few weeks later I decided to visit the HQ with a friend from New York, and Fancy did not disappoint. Aside from the solid 'Dog we were greeted by very friendly staff, and were also introduced to their delicious miniature donuts! We had a dozen each of the classic and the Nutella/Biscotti treats and they really did not disappoint. The warm, fluffy, and flavourful little fellas are a bargain at ~$5/dozen and will definitely lead me back to this corner of College St."}
{"text":"It is good to see new restaurants opening in this area, and that some famous names or brands decide to open there. The store just opened in early October 2017, and cashiers and cooks are still learning the menu, prices, ingredients etc. They do not have time yet to be that nice or welcoming with new customers (nothing specific to make you feel welcome or invite you to come back).  I guess the menu items are similar to other Franks, thus either you like it or not... I am not a huge fan of hot dogs anymore, after a few years in Toronto, nor of theirs (the bun is to thick and dry for me). The poutines are more interesting.  The place is relatively small, but you can eat in (one table and a counter against the wall where 8 persons could seat, aligned)."}
{"text":"Very yummy hot dogs with a lot-a lot of options. Staff is very nice and they're always really chill. I love the atmosphere -- has that old-school Coney Island-type vibe. They also make killer fries & poutines. Good selection of pops/juices and they make those mini donuts too! Student deals & good drunk food."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a quick dinner on Sat night and it is very easy to spot as it is located west of the Spadina and Queen intersection.  Decor: Loved the full wall mural and seating. Menu looked like it was written in chalk on the top of the wall.  Food: We ordered 2 hotdogs, fries and mini-donuts (I was surprised they had donuts!). First, the 2 hotdogs we tried were: Fancy Francine and Kimchi Dog. Fancy Francine bit - it had a whole egg sunny side up with bacon and hollandaise sauce underneath. Tough to eat but tasty. The kimchi dog was a korean twist with kimchi, seaweed and mayo. Similarly, tough to eat but tasty. The buns for both were soft and fresh. Flavour-wise, the toppings were great but I found the hotdogs to be a bit tough to bite through - perhaps the it could have been cut a bit before serving. Fries were great. But by far the best and perhaps most surprising was the mini-donuts - we ordered a 6-pack of the nutella glazed with crush biscotti - wow - this was amazing!!! Donuts were made on the spot so they were warm and soft. Combined with the nutella - the whole thing melted in your mouth!  So - hotdogs were a bit mixed (Kraft Dog has better flavour) but the donuts were the best!"}
{"text":"Came to the Bloor location with my husband and our two girls.  The place was empty.  A couple of guys came in, looked at the menu and then left.  We ordered 2 poutines and 4 dogs totaling $42.    Seen it on, \"you gotta eat here\".  Food quality is poor.  Portion for the price is very small.  Nothing special.  Came to try something new.  Wished we went to the hot dog vendor down the street.  Customer service was great!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to go for a quick bite. Can't really go wrong or mess up hot dogs. I tried the Frank's Coney Island which is a hot dog with chilli, onions, and mustard -it's simple. They have many more options to chose from and you can also add extra typical hot dog toppings over on top if you like. The hot dogs are juicy and made with beef. Their hot dogs overall was average  tasting. I wasn't really happy about the poutine though because the cheese curds didn't melt at all into the fries and gravy, so it still had that rubbery texture.   The service was excellent. Very friendly staff. We dropped one of our hot dogs on the floor because the baskets and milkshake cup was sliding around over the tray. We felt terrible about the mess we made, but the guys were nice enough to quickly make us a new one free of charge and clean up our mess.   The decor of the place is modern and casual. I was surprised at the number of seats available for such a small hot dog joint. They have benches and tables outside around the corner against their side wall as well for the warmer days.   Will definitely come back if in the area and feeling for something quick and easy."}
{"text":"This is based on their burgers, even though they're more well known for their interesting hot dog combinations. I got their American cheeseburger and A+ for the service. The burger itself was mediocre, I found nothing very special about it as I could have found this burger elsewhere but props to the good service. Also, the place was really clean!!"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: A pricey sausage fest of mediocrity.  Fancy Franks just didn't do it for me. I love their external mural and the overall design of the shop - their vintage photos of ladies and their oral fixations is not at all suggestive. ;) They have a great variety of dogs topped with some creative toppings...but the extras add up quickly. It's a dollar for a sausage upgrade and about $3-4 to make it a combo with fries and a soda. But when it comes down to it, I just can't seem appreciate their fancy dogs more than I can street meat.  I ordered their SOUTHERN FANCY and upgraded it with the SPICY SAUSAGE. It comes with a good helping of pulled pork (nice charred taste to it) and pickled red cabbage. Others have complained about their buns, but I love their  big buns (and I cannot lie)...it's actually necessary to hold their toppings together! The sausage was nice and juicy (though it's hard to mess up pork and fat essentially) with a good kick to it. Overall, while their product is pretty solid, their pricing is outside my impulsive purchase range."}
{"text":"I stopped into Fancy Franks after a day of wandering around the city with my boyfriend. It was my first time there. I'm a lover of street meat so I thought this would be a good choice.   The selection is pretty great, there are a lot if options to choose from-especially if you like dressing up your dogs.  I had the Coney Island dog, which was of course delicious. Although, it's pretty pricey for hot dogs. Our experience was pretty good, although the service was a little lacking. It took them a long time to prepare our food which I thought was a little odd for what you're getting. While we were waiting for our orders, the staff messed up 2 other people's orders. The staff didn't seem too interested in  customer service.  In the end, I would go back but I would not seek this place out. I'd rather stick with some good, old fashioned street meat."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some fresh donuts and hot chocolate. We got the nutella and crushed biscotti donuts and they were pretty good. Freshly fried and drizzled with nutella and bits of crushes biscotti. The dough could have fried a bit more, the insides were quite soft especially since there was no donut hole. The hot chocolate was disgusting - imagine milky water with a bit of cocoa. It wasn't even sweet.   Will be back to try their franks and poutine."}
{"text":"Oh you fancy huh?  In what used to be a computer parts and service store now stands the fanciest hot dog stand you've probably ever set foot in. The large communal table and the bar around the outside of the seating area is made from reclaimed wood, the floors look to be hardwood, and the walls are a natural brick. There is a vintage mural on the main wall of the eating area with pictures of people enjoying hot dogs.  I've visited Fancy Franks three times now and tried a range of the options. I'm really torn. But before I get into that let's go through what I tried.  On my first trip I went all out. I got the priciest dog on the menu, the Fancy-aano ($9), a poutine, and a fountain Pepsi. The Fancy-aano comes with arugula, parmigiano reggiano, prosciutto, and a balsamic dijon mustard. I wasn't overly impressed with my first visit. While the individual ingredients sound good and it was a very nice looking frank, I thought the mustard overpowered everything. There was a hint of the arugula and parm, but I couldn't tell that there was prosciutto on it.   The poutine was tasty. I like the gravy and the fries are solid. Unfortunately the gravy is not hot enough to melt the curds. Unless you have a strong hankering for poutine, this one is a pass for me.  My subsequent visits were better. The second dog I devoured was the Fancy 90210. Bacon, avocado, and tomato are standard. I added mozzarella and upgraded from the standard meat to a spicy sausage. I really enjoyed the flavour of the sausage. While I don't like that the buns are so large, for this one it's a good thing. The avocado and tomatoes are cut into such large chunks that they pop out when you bite down, so you can try to squish them into the large bun to prevent it.  Yesterday I popped in to try the dougnuts, but they still don't have them up and running. Tomorrow is apparently the day. To fill the void I grabbed a Fancy-zza. The toppings are what you would expect; pepperoni, mozzarella, and tomato sauce. At the suggestion of the employee helping me I added garlic mayo. The garlic mayo is AMAZING. So delicious.   The reason I'm torn is thus: The ingredients are local and they're great, but not really great enough to demand such a premium price. I mean, $7-9 for a hot dog is a good chunk of money to ask a consumer to spend. Also, the bun to meat ratio is not good. Too much bun, not enough dog. Clearly this is a 4-star review so the pros outweigh the cons but I'm going to let the dust settle before I make a final decision.  I should also mention that the franks are all beef, there's a veggie dog, and there's chicken too. No gluten-free bun option unfortunately.  There's a good amount of traffic and there could be a small line when you come. Though it seems like about half of the people wandering in are just checking out the menu with promises to come back at a later time."}
{"text":"Really great hotdogs. Pricey indeed, but for all the unique toppings I feel like it's fine to have once in a while. In comparison to the hot dog street vendors, these hotdogs weren't any better, but what made these stand out were their buns. Oh man, I can eat their buns on their own if I had the chance. They were extremely soft and can melts in your mouth...in a good way. I got the turkey frank with the Seoul toppings. They gladly substituted the beef tips for the crab on my toppings. My friend got the veggie dog and fries, which was apparently great too, but not any different to the street ones he usually gets.  I wouldn't go here regularly, but for a change its a good option.  Previous reviews have claimed that the size is too small and not filling. But I feel like it's a regular size that you would get anywhere else. This with a side would easily satisfy someone."}
{"text":"This looks like a pretty neat establishment but all the hype does not match what's on the inside. Their hot dogs are average considering what you pay for them. At about 3 times more than some street meat, they're pretty small and toppings are quite minimal. I don't mind paying for something unique or something I can't get anywhere else, but this is not it.  The hot dog I had was decent. They get points for presentation of the food, but the hot dog wasn't anything special. We also ordered the Chili poutine which was good, but salty.  Overall, I'd say go out and buy a hot dog on the street and grab dessert some place else with the money you save."}
{"text":"I experienced this guilt-ridden heaven for the first time yesterday. To start, it's a small place so I recommend going before or after the lunch rush. Fast forward to me standing at the counter, I was so overwhelmed by the menu! If you like outrageous food then you will enjoy this place! I have to admit, I did not have a hot dog here - I was swayed by all the crazy poutine concoctions - options like grilled cheese poutine (yes, there is a grilled cheese sandwich in your poutine!), the Not So Fancy (which is basically a hybrid between having a hot dog and a poutine) and of course my selected choice, the Porker *swoons* They only have one size and it was just under $13, so not really cheap.  It was not only delicious, but it was so hearty! They cut their own fries so everything is fresh, fresh, fresh! Be prepared for a full on food coma. Post-Porker I required a coffee and an energy drink to make it through the rest of the afternoon! My friend had the Buffalo wing Hot dog and said it was delicious. I planned on taking a half-dozen box of mini donuts back to the office, but I was so full I could not even entertain the idea at that point! Maybe next time..! If I can ever convince myself to not have poutine, I'll make sure to give a hot dog a try!"}
{"text":"So listen, there's nothing quite like a hot dog from a cart on a nice day. This Sunday's 18 degree and sunny park hang had me fixated on an early dinner a la cart (see what I did there?). But, upon arrival at the Bloor and Dufferin street meat man, I learned they were out of veggie dogs. Heart broken but still determined, we made our way to Fancy Franks, about an eight minute walk away.   The set up here is kind of Subway-esque, minus the intense chain restaurant vibe of course. They have a number of fancy topping combo options, or you can get a naked dog and and add toppings to your liking. I was pretty fixated on classic cart options, so went pretty basic with ketchup, mustard, sauerkraut and mayo, but also added some potato chips for crunch. YUM. Good dog, and nice yellow eggy bun to boot. My partner - a meat eater who opted for a veg dog too - even said they couldn't tell it wasn't meat. High praise. Plus, we got two dogs plus a bottle of pop for like $12.  This was my first visit to Fancy Franks and now that I've been, I'll keep it in mind for future cravings."}
{"text":"It's good but they put the condiment sauces on top of the toppings. I guess it's supposed to look nice but it just makes it a mess. The plain dog is a great deal because a lot of toppings are free"}
{"text":"Originally, my boyfriend and I were going to dine at a different establishment but alas, it was not meant to be. The other establishment was unexpectedly closed on the day of without prior notice.   Luckily, I had Fancy Franks bookmarked due to how over-the-top their hot dog menu looked! I'm not a huge fan of hot dogs but their unique poutine menu is what drew me in.   My boyfriend got the onion rings and the hot dog named \"the Frankaphone\" as depicted in the picture. He said that the hot dog's ingredients and sauces were delicious and that they definitely complimented each other!  I personally ordered the \"Fancy Schmancy\" poutine. To my delight, it was scrumptious. The onions were grilled to perfection, and as for the protein to fry ratio, they do not skimp on the meat!   I would definitely come back again if I wanted to treat myself to a well crafted poutine!"}
{"text":"Came here to take my cousins out and it's cool that have different types of hotdogs that you can get with a veggie option.  I had the kimchi and noodles poutine which was pretty good.  For me prices are a little high for hotdogs.  I would be happier to just eat hotdog on the street.  It's way cheaper."}
{"text":"If you're a huge hotdog fan, or want to try something unique for dinner it's definitely a spot worth checking out.  The dog I ordered (coney island) was good, but t seemed rather small for $7+ . I ordered a poutine as well, but it also seemed rather small for the price.  Overall I was satisfied though and would return if I happened to have a craving. The staff were also really nice"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to come to come to Fancy Frank's with the beautiful hand painted signs and the amazing branding, and now I can say I have went! The place is very Toronto, with the beautiful designs and rustic look on the inside. They offer gourmet hot dogs and other items such as doughnuts, fries, and poutine and more.  They have lots of different hot dogs with different toppings such as scrambled eggs, onions, avocado, and lots more. I ordered the 90210 hot dog; my friends also had different hot dogs, a poutine, and doughnuts as well. The hot dog... was good. I did not sing high praises about it but it's pretty good. The price was about $9~ or so and honestly I wasn't full after it and found it kind of pricey. The fries were not very tasty and kind of like cardboard until my friend dumped the gravy on it, and the doughnuts were decent. It was an average meal.  Service was pretty good and helpful. In conclusion, 3.5/5. I liked the experience and the food there, but it's only a \"once in a long long while\" place for me."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness.   Went here with my husband last night a little after 10 o'clock for some hot dogs and doughnuts. I got the Coney Island and he got the Plain Ol' Frank. The chili on the Coney dog was a thing of beauty. Meaty, but not too chunky. Spicy, but not too hot. Saucy, but not all sauce. I've found that chili is a very hit or miss thing when you go somewhere new since there are so many different styles and ways to make it. Fancy Franks' was divine. I will most certainly give the chili poutine fries a try next time around! My husband really liked his dog, too, although he didn't opt for anything fancy.   And now, the doughnuts. The glorious, glorious doughnuts. Seriously, these babies are so fluffy and flavorful it's ridiculous. I guess you can compare them to Tiny Toms doughnuts, but really I'd say that Fancy Franks' doughnuts are more like sweet, puffy clouds of deliciousness that Tiny Tom doughnuts use as pillows while they dream of all that they wish they could be. We got one dozen doughnuts - six powdered sugar topped with lemon curd, six glazed cinnamon. Both were wonderful, but both my husband and I agreed that the glazed cinnamon were superior. They tasted like a Disneyland churro glazed with magic. I wanted to eat all of them in one sitting, but my stomach was already too full from the chili dog.   The staff was really friendly, too. Since we were there around closing, they let us know before they shut down the doughnut maker in case we wanted to order some before we left (which we did).   Oh, and hooray for the 15% student discount!   My only two complaints:  - They charge $2 extra is you want some shredded cheddar cheese added to your hotdog, which I think is a pretty absurd amount for a sprinkle of cheese. - I couldn't seem find their hours posted online anywhere, which was a little annoying. I guess we got there right on time."}
{"text":"After wandering around Parliament St for about twenty minutes on Sunday afternoon around 2PM looking for a spot that would accommodate the eight of us for a late lunch, we stumbled upon Fancy Franks. Seating is quite minimal - there's a counter by the wall and the window, as well as a longer table which luckily was empty and fit all of us.  I actually had a hard time deciding what to get because so many of the hot dogs sounded so good, but I settled on the Franks Got Seoul which has Korean beef ribs, kimchi, scallions and sesame. It wasn't bad, but not great. I enjoyed the bun and the hot dog itself, but found that the toppings had an overpowering ginger taste which I wasn't a fan of. The onion rings which I got as my combo side were nice and crispy but a little overcooked for my liking, and the portion was quite small. I snuck a few fries from my friends (regular and cajun) which were pretty good - portion sizes were definitely bigger than the onion rings. My friends enjoyed their hot dogs and poutines but like me, were not blown away. Service was polite and efficient.   All in all, a decent place with some creative hot dogs. I wouldn't be opposed to returning and trying something else, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"Fancy won't let you down.*  Their buffalo dog is delicious. No it's not made of buffalo, it's a deep fried hotdog disguised as a beautiful chicken wing. Celery toppings, blue cheese and hot sauce make this the tastiest hot dog in the history of the world. And I don't even really like hot dogs that much, which is probably why this place is a four star stop and not a five.   I know that $6-$10 seems a bit pricy for a hot dog, but these really are specialty dogs and beautifully crafted meals. Plus everything is local which makes you feel nice about supporting FF's.  The mural outside is fun and adds whimsy to this otherwise boring block at the north end of Kensington, and the inside is warm and welcoming.   Yessir, I'm a fanna Frank's.   *I love Reba McIntyre, don't tell anyone."}
