{"text":"Delicious!   Super Fresh Veggies!  My new favorite place.   There is absolutely nothing yucky about their yucca fries!  So good.  The smoothies are made out of real food and not processed garbage like other smoothie places."}
{"text":"Comparable to Freshii ... fresh clean with variety of vegetables for your  salad. The chicken breast is good - grilled to perfection and the Yuca fries is the best. Tastes like the real thing but tasty with yammi tsiziki sauce. Good lunch alternative"}
{"text":"First time visit. I am very impressed. We walked in and were looking at the menu. The server asked us if we had been before and we said \"no\" so she went through the menu with us and explained everything. They have a good variety of healthy pitas to choose from. All the ingredients are fresh and yummy. They will grill your veggies for you, which I love. And you can watch them make your pita as the grill and \"kitchen\" is all open concept. The restaurant was clean.  All the tables not being used were cleaned off right after the customer left. The staff were friendly and accommodating. We ordered 2 large pitas and 2 drinks and it came to just over $20. But the food was great quality so it was worth the price. I definitely recommend trying this place out. We will definitely be back!"}
