{"text":"This place has 2 sandwiches cheese steak and cheese chicken! There are some small eats for kiddos but you owe it to yourself to stop here after a long IKEA hike. The bread is what seals the deal for me.  I had the chicken with cheese whiz and buffalo sauce. #nailedit!   The staff was also crazy nice! No five stars only because I thought they served other types of sandwiches too."}
{"text":"First of all, the service was awesome.  I will go back for that reason alone.  But, then there's also the food.  Nothing short of an excellent steak.  I got a Philly Original, \"wit\" and \"wiz\".  I also ordered fries and got a free drink.  I mean, c'mon.  Great place.  Reasonable prices.  As close as you can get to authentic in AZ."}
{"text":"Woah, some good phillys up in here! Pretty simple menu, big sandwiches and a bunch of toppings that are available this side of the counter. I got just a regular steak philly with peppers and onions, it was gone within seconds. French frys are really good too and with the fry sauce they got, makes it even better. Every once in a while I'm in this area so next time I'm around, I'm stopping here."}
{"text":"Hands down the best philly cheesesteak I've had in the valley. I always order the Philly Original with Cheese Whiz. It is so delicious and mouth-watering. The staff is cool and friendly. The place is always, always clean and so are the restrooms. It's one of my favorite lunch spots. They always get my order right and and I never have to wait a long time. They have a mini fridge where you can get free extras like pepperoncinis or jalapenos. This place is very well-managed. Kudos to the owners."}
{"text":"Got the regular size steak with Wiz, onions and mushrooms. It was $10. After eating it, the price seemed fair for the quality and size.  They definitely use fresh ingredients. The steak was top notch, just so moist and delicious. It came on a white, just firm enough to hold it all together to the end, roll.   Grilled fresh mushrooms with the right amount of grilled onions and Wiz. No one ingredient overpowered the others. Man it was hot and juicy, just awesome.    If Genos and Pats in Philly are better than the cheesesteaks that Forefathers is serving up, I just might have to move to PA."}
{"text":"If you aren't getting your Cheesesteaks at Forefathers, you aren't getting the best there is. Hands down, the best Cheesesteak I have ever had (having never been to Philly) and will continue to have.   The roll is fresh with just the right balance needed on for the sandwich. The steak is cooked to perfection. The cheese is exactly what it needs. You can get it wit or wit'out (with onions or not) and have a large selection of cheeses including the original Cheez Wiz (my personal favorite). Their large is completely filling but only necessary if you are starving. Get a regular and combo it with the regular fries. Then you must try out the Utah-stolen \"fry sauce\" (a combination of Mayo and Ketchup that hits the spot with fries). Considering I am grew up in Utah, these guys are my new best friends.  NOTE: If you plan on become a regular like me, request the rewards card from them. I only recently became aware of this as they do not advertise it but make sure to pick one up. Get 100 points (spend $100) get a free cheesesteak.   Now please, stop reading and get a Cheesesteak."}
{"text":"They ruined my taste for my previous favorite philly shop. GOOD stuff. Fry sauce and all."}
{"text":"When looking for a good cheese steak its all about the options! The \"wit\" or \"wit out\"  as well as the \"wiz\" you can keep that in Philly!  The secret here is the buffalo cheese steak! I suggest any cheese other than cheese wiz to get the full flavor! As for the fries some of the best this foodie has tasted and you can't go wrong with never ending fry sauce! Hands down best cheese steak on the east side. If you are thinking of going to other places nearby check out my other reviews...."}
{"text":"\"Gourmet\"  is used loosely here.  If your meat is all pre-cooked and they just toss it on the grill to warm it up, can you really say you're gourmet? I'm pretty sure that's what Mickey- D's does, and no one is claiming they're gourmet.  I could probably get over that fact if it weren't for a horrible interaction I had with one of the employees regarding their bread.  When walking into Forefathers, they have a sign declaring that what makes the sandwiches they serve better than any other is the bread.  Turns out, they don't make the bread in the store.  Ok, I can get on board with using a local bakery to make your bread.  What I cannot get on board with is the fact that they have no idea what is in the bread they serve, nor do they have any interest at all in finding out!   My allergies to dairy and eggs make it difficult to find bread that I can eat.  When I asked the lady at the register if their bread had dairy or eggs she said she didn't know and couldn't find out.  Ok, I'll have a salad and I'm fine with that.  The issue came when I suggested that she may want to ask the bakery next time she talked to them as food allergies are becoming more common.  She said no she didn't think she would do that and that I was the only one who had ever asked.  WRONG answer! It is an insult to gourmet eateries everywhere to not know exactly what is in everything you serve.  If the bread is really what makes the sandwich, why don't you know what's in it.  I, for one, will not be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome cheesesteak. Friendly staff and I love the fry sause. Reminds me of home in Wyoming. Is a little pricey for a combo deal. We be back again."}
{"text":"I work about a 1/2 mile from this awesome place of food!! I was bored with many of the places in the immediate area and ran across this place by accident. WOW!!! It has become one of my all-time favorite places to eat now. I am usually a little bit on the frugal side but with this place I do make an exception. It cost me right around $10.00 for a lunch but I have to admit it will make you want to go back everyday. I usually get the pizza cheese steak with grilled onions and peperoni. and a side of frys.... and the awesome dipping sauce. Great dinning experience for sure. If you are looking for a great meal and friendly atmosphere this is the place for you. TRY IT!!"}
{"text":"If you like steak & cheese subs, Forefather's is the BEST! Owners Tony and Mary care about their customers, and make you feel like you are dining at their house.  There is nothing I like better in the food service industry than a business run by local owners who are on-site and often do the cooking and care about customer service.  Their sub rolls are baked locally and the meat is flown in from Philidelphia.  For those of you non-beef eaters, they serve a chicken filled sub.  Prices range from $6.59 (including tax) for a regular sized sub to $10.89 (including tax) for the large with fries and a large soda.  I'm told a real Philly cheese steak is made with Cheese-Wiz (when I think Cheese Wiz, I think an aersol can, but this Wiz is different).  I prefer provolone cheese versus Cheese Wiz (the Wiz is a little too sweet for me). But, as the company tee shirts proclaim, \"there's nothing like a good wiz\"."}
{"text":"I've been to pats, ginos, and jims in Philly and this place is just as good as any of them.   Always always always go with the whiz, and give the sweet potato fries a shot.  You won't be disappointed with this place. Hands down best and most authentic cheesesteak in AZ"}
{"text":"I recently went to Forefathers for dinner last Wednesday night.  It is located conveniently close to where I work at in Tempe on the corner of Priest and Warner.  As i walked in i was greeted by the friendly staff.  At the counter, I reviewed the giant menu posted on the wall.  Being that this wasn't my first time there, it didn't take long to decide on the regular Philly with Cheese Whiz, which is essentially nacho cheese.  I chose grilled onions as my topping along with fries and a drink.  The total came to about $12, a little much, but really only a few more dollars than what you would pay for a combo meal at any fast food joint.  Everything was grilled and prepared fresh to order right in front of me, and the wait was under 5 minutes.   There was decent amount of seating inside and out.  I went outside because the weather was nice.  My first bite was like a meatastic heaven as molten cheese, onions, and shredded steak made my filling Philly dream.  With every bite I could feel my arteries filling with the golden goodness.  The fries provided the perfect balance of crisp outside and soft warm inside.   Overall my experience was satisfactory I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys tasty meats and gooey cheese."}
{"text":"Good cheese steaks!  I nearly skipped the didn't get the fries and what a mistake that would have been.  The fries sauce is awesome!!  Good came out quick and left nothing to be desired. Whole heartedly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Absolutely worth a try! I haven't been to Philly so I can't compare it to the \"real deal\" but these are the most delicious Cheesesteak sandwiches I've ever had! The meat is tender and not fatty, and you get a lot of it! I love pouring the fry sauce on top of the sandwich, it gives it a little extra kick. They've also got the option of sweet potato fries, which are just a good if not better than the regular fries!   The restaurant itself is a bit congested and small for such a popular lunch spot, but the staff keeps it clean."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of running into the food truck today around lunch time.. somehow it just fell into place. These are great people making GREAT food! I'm very happy to have stopped and I hope to see them again very soon!!   Had the classic sandwich and iced tea. Dying for another!"}
{"text":"Great cheesesteaks and the fry sauce is so good my wife wants to bring it home as our third child. Good clean non chain with excellent food."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!   They have delicious food, friendly staff, and speedy service! The next time you are in the area make sure to stop here and get a steak sandwich and fries!"}
{"text":"I always get the number 1 and its always spot on.  Cheesesteaks are one of my favorite foods and I have jumped from place to place and this is my favorite by far.  I've tried most in the Phoenix area.  I work in downtown Phoenix so I don't get it as much as I like but I make the trip often.  Always friendly and always great.  My vote for Best of Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is the best place for a cheese steak. My boyfriend and I moved here a few years ago from Philadelphia so we know a good cheese steak! The bread is incredible and the sandwiches are delicious. We go here every time we get a craving. The fries are delicious as well. Cheese steak with wiz and onions and a side of cheese fries... you can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Everything was authentic and really tasty.  They must be using rib-eye because the meat was better than most cheesesteak wannabes.  The bread was an added bonus and the cheese fries were a great fit."}
{"text":"Love cheesesteaks? Love sweet potato fries? Then you've yelped the right place. My fiancée and I stopped in here yesterday because I had a craving for some sweet potato fries. The employees are very friendly and helpful. We ordered a Large plain cheesesteak and a side of sweet potato fries. Everything was delicious, like others have said the steak was not dry at all. My only complaint is the price you pay for sweet potato fries and the amount you get. Other than that this place was freakin' awesome! We will defiantly be back"}
{"text":"As a fan of cheesesteaks, this place has a very good to great cheesesteak sandwich.  I have to say very good only because I have had a sandwich which the meat was a little dry.  Sometimes that is too be expected if the meat is left on the grill before it is actually finished.  I am not a fan of the sweet potato fries, but my buddy who was with me loved them.  I would recommend this place if you like or love cheesesteaks.  Sometimes, er, most of time, the sandwich will get messy, but that's part of the process and the fun."}
{"text":"We stopped at Forefathers for lunch after a hike at South Mountain.  This was our first visit, but our friends go there often for father-son lunches.   It was great!  The place was packed and people were even sitting outside in the rain. If that doesn't tell you how good the food is, I don't know what will.   Even though the place was packed the staff was friendly and efficient. The line moved fast!  Our Original Phillys were tasty and messy, just the way I believe a Philly should be!  The fries were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, perfect!  Be sure to try the fry-sauce!  Our only negative was the size of the dining area. It was a bit small and crowded today (it was raining, so no sitting outside)."}
{"text":"When you are visiting IKEA in Tempe and are not in the mood for meatballs, check out Forefathers! It's yummy, quick and affordable, nice staff too. Don't forget to try the sauces!"}
{"text":"This is as close as you can get to a Philly cheesesteak sandwich in Arizona.  I have eating at Pat's ,Geno's and Jims and this is very good in comparison. Those are three of the best in Philly."}
{"text":"This was very  yummy. Sweet potato fries were crunchy and not greasy at all. Fry sauce was amazing. I had the chicken with provalone, onions and green bell peppers. Oh and the sweet  peppers were great. Fast service, clean place. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Simply an eh!  I can't get over calling this place gourmet.  The sandwich is okay and pouring cheese sauce on everything doesn't make it gourmet.  Uncle Sams has much tastier steak sandwiches and are more reasonably priced.  I guess it just isn't for me."}
{"text":"Outstanding, except for the bread, this the closet you will  find to Geno's or Phil's in Philadelphia. The person that conducted the challenge with Philly's Finest obviously should not be conducting food challenge's. I went to Philly's first and feel like I wasted 10.00 dollars"}
{"text":"Very tasty cheese steaks featuring the whiz with onions as an option. They also have some chicken menu items as an alternative. Sweet potato fries are awesome. I definitely recommend this joint."}
{"text":"This place is legit! The bread is soft and the proper consistency, the steak is perfect, and the whiz is the whiz. I was a 7 out of 10 on the fries, but the fry sauce was awesome. I've eaten at all the best places in Philly and this hangs with them. Best you can get in AZ. All the little sauces are great as well. If you need a fix, this is it. We spent about $60 for 7 people. It included sandwiches, soup, fries, and drinks.  Just do it!"}
{"text":"I feel as righteous about my Cheesesteaks as I do about Bagels. Forefathers has the most awesome Cheesesteaks this side of the Mississippi.   The bread was perfect. The steak flavorful and cooked to perfection (read: not dry). I use to tell everyone that Uncle Sam's had the best Cheesesteaks around. Sorry Uncle Sam's, this place has you beat hands down -- the most genuine you can find outside of South Street in Philadelphia.   The regular is a perfect size unless you are really really really really really (you get the picture) hungry.   You've got to stop in and try this place out! I hope they open a few more locations! (South Phoenix would be great - hint, hint)."}
{"text":"There is no other location I have found in Arizona, that comes as close to authentic Philly cheesesteaks, I've been to South Philly numerous times and I had Geno's cheesesteaks and forefathers is a close second, hands-down the best in Arizona"}
{"text":"Great food - this is one of my favorite places to eat. Prices are fairly reasonable, especially for the quality of the food. I've lost count of the number of times I've eaten here.   Does get busy around lunch time from all the local businesses, but for dinner it can't be beat. Try a cookie too, they're delicious."}
{"text":"Really good steaks, a little pricey but good. Very friendly staff which always rocks!"}
{"text":"Very clean. Fair price for the quality food and ingredients. Simple menu. Good cheesesteaks and fries. Be aware of the cheese fries as they use real thick cheese :). It may be a little overwhelming. Overall, very good restaurant. We will return."}
{"text":"Quick stop at a place we didn't even know was there. What an amazing surprise. Fresh rolls, perfectly grilled steak and of course had to go with Whiz for an authentic cheesesteak. Friendly service, clean restaurant. We will certainly be back as I now have a favorite cheesesteak joint in the valley."}
{"text":"Amaaaazing.... totally in love. The larges are gigantic, the regular cheesesteaks are always plenty... the service is always warming and welcoming... miss these guys since movin to philly..."}
{"text":"This is the best cheesesteak I've had since the 70's .... I will be back every chance I get . But this time I'm getting a few to go for the ride back to Tucson"}
{"text":"The chicken tenders were disgraceful.  Reconstituted chicken parts worthy of McDonald's. Our cheese steak sandwich was good but not great as you expect it to be with the word gourmet in the title of the restaurant.  The service was great and very friendly which makes me sad that I have to give a generally unfavorable review."}
{"text":"Sooo glad I turned left at the sidewalk instead of heading for a smoothie. This is the hottest, most  tender, delicious cheese steak ever. Perfect toasty bread. I had mine with spicy blue cheese sauce and American cheese. Insert  the \" I'll have what she's having\" moaning sound here. I want to keep eating this until the paramedics come. Oh wait, they're all here. Come try this. Clean and great service too."}
{"text":"I''ve just started really getting into cheese steaks and this place was awesome. Bread was good, and steak wasn't greasy. Fries were great too."}
{"text":"i love forskin fathers silky smooth cheese sticks, da bess I've Eva had, the buns get very soggy do!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The prices are reasonable (not dirt cheap but certainly fair) and the service is quick. I often go to a cheesesteak place by my work which--despite being less busy--always take too long to get my food! They don't offer too much other than fries and cheesesteaks  so don't go there if you want something else. Most importantly the food tasted amazing! The fries were the best in my opinion so I highly recommend trying them!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. #5 with the vinaigrette side salad or sweet potatoe fries. Soo good."}
{"text":"Ate there on a friend's recommendation. The regular cheesesteak was superb.  I recommend the Cheez Whiz and OM.  A bit noisy during lunch, some sound absorption treatment would be help. Limited selection of soft drinks.  Local, family owned and cordial staff.   The beef was moist and flavorful. The hallway tribute to our Founding Fathers is a nice touch.  Yes we will be back."}
{"text":"My first and last visit.  Walk in and it is loud, very small and very loud.  Someone recommended this place to my wife and since I love Cheese Steaks I though I would give it a try.  Order a regular cheesesteak, cheese fries, soda for both of us.  The steak was tasted like minute steak, the cheese I could not taste.  The FF were covered with too much cheese.  And did I say it was too loud to even hold a conversation unless you wanted to talk louder than the guy yapping a foot away from you.  So after watching here is what I recommend if you do go.  Get the cheez whiz on your steak and do not get cheese on the FF.  But if you want a really good cheesesteak go to Philly's Famous in Chandler.  Oh yea just because you call it Gourmet, does not make it gourmet. Gourmet  describes a class of restaurant, cuisine, meal or ingredient of high quality, of special presentation, or high sophistication.  None of that is happening here."}
{"text":"Best Philly sandwiches in the area.  Busy between 1130-1230 but I have always still found a seat.  Soo good they put the new cheesesteak place down the street out of business in about a month.  You will not be disappointed.  Get the sandwich with whiz, mushrooms and onions and the fries with fry sauce.  Mmmmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Some of the best cheesesteaks i've had. Should of went with the more popular original (steak & cheese whiz), but instead, tried it with my fav, provolone. While the meat and chesse tasted really good, the overall finish was somewhat dry. Probably my only drawback since all my cheesesteak consisted of was bread + steak + provolone cheese. I'm going back because the fries were some of the best I've had. The service was very friendly. My fiance ordered the kids meal (she wanted the grilled cheese) and said it was really good. Portions are right on, a little too much actually. I got the regular and couldnt finish it. But when I go back, I'm going to try the Steak 'wit cheez'.   A- vote.  01/11/2010 UPDATE: I've been back and tried the original (steak with cheese whiz). Oh my! Now THIS is what I'm talking about!!! Best cheesesteak I've ever had outside of Philly.  A+  Also- the employees are still as nice as the 1st time. GREAT service, arguably in the top 3 in all of the Phoenix metro. I've been there 6 times to date and haven't been disappointed.  Also- I must add that their 'fry sauce', whatever mysterious blend of tastebud utopia, is amazing. I don't know what it is, but I love that stuff. Far better than regular ketchup. Also- their fries are ALWAYS cooked to perfection. I've yet to have soggy fries nor old, stale fries.   LOVE THIS PLACE.  (request to owners- if you can, please open up a new location. maybe Tempe Marketplace?? you guys are leaps and bounds better than the Great Steak Escape or whatever they are called)."}
{"text":"Horrible cheesesteaks!  No flavor at all, just a greasy mess of meat in a bun."}
{"text":"Hands down the best cheesesteak in the Valley. The only downside is that there are not other, more convenient locations. The large cheesesteak is very large so only order it if you are super hungry. As an added bonus, this place is decorated with pictures of the Founding Fathers. America ftw!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since the day they opened and they have never deviated from serving the best Cheesesteak, Fries and sauce in all of Arizona.  Guaranteed excellent meal."}
{"text":"Food is ok, service is pretty bad. When you go out to eat you should get your food the way you like it. I politely asked to fix it, even offered to pay more. The guy looked at me like I was stupid and did nothing for me.  I wasn't in the mood to argue so I let it go. If the food was great I would maybe put up with the jackwagon behind the counter but it was bland and nothing special so definitely never going back. When a customer is trying to give you money to be happy and you dont take it and leave them mad, there is a problem (management). Don't know how they can afford to pay 8 guys to stand around if they don't take my money."}
{"text":"Moved to AZ from South Philadelphia, thought I would give this a try, food is below average, gimmick story with very high prices.  $25.00 for one cheese steak, salad and small fries.  Would not recommend or go back."}
{"text":"Only qualm would be prices, but they aren't even that bad.  Regular cheesesteak, fries and a drink set me back roughly $12.  Sooooooooooo delicious though, highly recommended if you like cheesesteaks."}
{"text":"Amazing true east coast cheese steak sandwiches with real cheese whiz!  Employees are friendly and efficient. Service is fast.  I would recommend this to anyone from the east coast looking for a bit of home."}
{"text":"We tried Forefathers for the fist time last night, it was a very good experience. The staff was nice and helpful, the place was clean and comfortable, very casual. The side salad was fresh, the fries crispy, and they offer a bevy of free sweet bell pepper, cherry peppers, jalapenos, or fry sauce. Our household believes the best thing about the place were the cheese steaks, yummy and satisfying."}
{"text":"Forefathers was recommended by my co-workers so I decided to try it out! Ordered a Philly cheesesteak with provolone, onions, and mushrooms; made it a meal and got cheese fries. The sandwich was ok, it didn't wow me like I was hoping. It didn't have enough cheese so I felt the sandwich was dry. The cheese for the cheese fries started hardening pretty quickly and was not hot at all. The location was cool and the service and employees were really nice.   I am going to give it another try. Next time I'm going with  the \"cheesewiz\" instead of the provolone or the buffalo chicken and will try the sweet potatoes fries.   I would give it a try wasn't that expensive either."}
{"text":"The cheese steaks here are legit.  I had just had one in philly a few weeks ago so I had the urge and this place totally hit the spot. The rolls were fresh and seemed like the same ones they use in Philly.  The fries weren't anything special but the fry sauce was very tasty.   I'd say this is one of the best cheese steaks I've had outside of Philly. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse sandwich in town! I love the cheese wiz and sweet peppers! Great price for a lot of food!"}
{"text":"I've always hated Philly cheesesteaks until I came here. This was absolutely delicious! So much flavor, cheese and the steaks melted in my mouth. Wasn't dry whatsoever. The sweet potato fries are the best I've ever had. I felt bad coming in and eating at 7:30 (they close at 8 pm) but when I was done eating my food, these customers walked in at 7:59, one minute before they closed. And they still served them. That's some great customer service! Although it was a huge asshole move from the customers, it made me so upset. Props to the staff. And thank you for the best Philly cheesesteak"}
{"text":"The food is good but OMG a small steak and cheese with extra cheese and a small fries with no drink was $15.04.  Fries alone was $3.47.  Won't be back due to the prices."}
{"text":"The place to go in Arizona for Philly street food - get the cheesesteak and fries!!!! Yum"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Tempe spots, Forefathers really instilled in me a love for the Philly cheesesteak sandwich. When visiting, I always order the 2nd cheesesteak option with white American cheese, and either a side of french fries or their equally excellent sweet potato fries. For those wanting to manage their portions, their sandwiches also come in smaller sizes. After placing your order, be sure to go to the small refrigerator across from the soda machine and get a side of their sweet peppers to accompany your sandwich. This place has great food, and along with it a comfortable, casual dining environment. It also has friendly ownership and staff. It's been a while since I lived in Phoenix, but whenever I return and come to Forefathers, there are people working here who remember me and welcome me back. If you check out Forefathers, I am sure you'll want to come back again."}
{"text":"Super Cheesesteak, maybe one of the best in town. Great service.....By the way, I know I said in another post about being a vegetarian...I actually ate here before that but because yelp can't figure out how to post a review from a mobile phone, it sat and I forgot (Throwing in my peeve about Yelp...haha)"}
{"text":"I found this place on YELP and was pleasantly surprised. I the menu is simple and straight forward. The entire place was clean and had a welcoming atmosphere. Our entire experience was met with great customer service, a friendly staff, very nice owner and the food was great. My wife had a salad with chicken and I had a cheesesteak with the steak. The portions were generous but not overwhelming to leave you feeling overfull. The flavor was great. Even though I live on the west side I would make the trip to enjoy the food again. I had the opportunity to speak with Victor, the owner. He was very accommodating and really nice to talk to you. I recommend Forefathers for a great meal at a relatively low price."}
{"text":"Four fathers was a very pleasant experience. The cheesesteak was very tasty. I shared a large cheesesteak with my husband and managed to finish my half before he did. I was very tempted to order another for myself but I managed to have self control.   I look forward to future visits with my husband."}
{"text":"Pretty darn close to the real thing! Make sure you are there way before closing because they will lock the doors about 10 til and not let you in. Sandwiches are great and don't forget about the fry sauce!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service.  I had a cheesteak  sandwich, fires and a soda.  The sandwich was cooked fresh and very hot.  The hogie roll was fresh with a good crust and soft inside.  The fries were hot and tasted good.    There were lots of condiments.  The most memorable was the 'fry sauce'  delicious.  The peppers were fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"These cheesesteaks let me tell you.  The meat is so thinly sliced, most importantly there is not a trace of nervy or fatty parts and it's made when you order. I always get the one with cheese whiz and it's to die for. They always put just the right amount of cheese to where it's not overwhelming.   Finally, the bun is so fresh and fluffy it's the perfect blanket for the aforementioned deliciousness. They come with grilled onion but I personally skip. I also recommend the fries which are super crispy and perfectly seasoned.   Don't forget the fry sauce!"}
{"text":"YUMMY!!!  This was my first time trying Forefathers and definitely won't be my last.  I ordered the regular steak philly with Cheese Whiz and although I will now have to up my workout tomorrow, it was worth it.  I loved that the sides were available to add as you like (the peppers)..great idea.   I also loved the sweet potato fries with fry sauce.  Love, love, love.   Thanks Tony!  Great place you have here."}
{"text":"So there we were on a Sunday afternoon, knowing I was hungry but not quite sure what I was in the mood for.  So pulled out my handy Yelp Ap on my phone to see what was in the area.  Forefathers quickly grabbed my attention.  Meat & Cheese yes! So there we go, I had the beef with cheese wiz, my BF had the chicken with marinara.  Both were loaded with meat/chicken, they were not stingy at all with the meat.  The lady at the counter was so friendly and helpful too.  I was able to get 2 cookies as a side, and OMG those cookies were the best! Make sure you try them, they are homemade, fat, and soft with chocolate chips. And normally I don't consider myself much of a french fries enthusiast, but they were so good I ended up eating half of my boyfriends order. I also loved the American theme, and felt like the place was a family business, I could be wrong but thats the vibe I got.  Overall, a very pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Food is amazing the service as always been great!! Today however the one guy with long black hair was an a$$.   We ordered our food and wanted cheese in the frys instead of on the side and he was rude and unprofessional about it!"}
{"text":"I first ventured into Forefathers about 4 weeks ago, and I must say those guys know what they're doing.  I've been to cheesesteak places where it took forever to get a sandwich.  I was in and out of Forefathers in about 5 minutes with a to-go order.  That being said, I was skeptical at first because of the speed it took to fill my order.  Nope.  They laid on the 'goods' something fierce.  The bread was as advertised.  It never got sloppy and held all the ingredients PERFECTLY.  I've read other reviews and must try some of their other foods.  Have to watch what days I do this on, because you never know when a 'grease bomb' is going to attack your innards, and I have workouts to consider.   This place is LEGIT.  GO. NOW!"}
{"text":"This food!  far exceeded our expectations. Place was clean, friendly, fast service (order at counter go pick your own table) and soooo soooo good! Crisp fries! Delicious Phillies! Yummy house dipping sauce. The regular size was huge! Don't have to spend a lot for a nice meal. Really glad we stopped here. Place was almost full when we went so clearly others are loving it too."}
{"text":"Ah-ha!  The closest to the real thing you'll get in the valley.   I walked to the counter and said 'Wiz-With' and that is what they served me, no questions asked!! If you know philly's then you undoubtedly know that is how to get it.   They have a picture of Genos, Pats, and Jims (og) on the wall where you walk in...so they set their expectations high as soon as you see that.   I have to bash on some of the reviews I have read asking for Peppers or other crap on the roll. You guys are a disgrace to rolls and if I heard you ask for that in person I'd hit you with snowballs.  This place is awesome. Go there and get a roll and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I was originally weary of the steak philly with cheese whiz but it was amazing! Order it with jalapeños for a perfect kick! You can also get low carb options as a bowl if you can't do the whole bread thing! Great spot!"}
{"text":"Great cheesesteak, fast service. Go with the steak, cheese whiz and OMG (onions, mushrooms,green peppers) - you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently good. My husband goes for the sandwich and sweet potato fries with fry sauce, and I'm all about the steak salad with tomato Parmesan dressing. The service is always friendly and upbeat. I love it!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first visit. I thought I was slightly beating the lunch rush by getting there around 11:30. Wrong! At 11:30 it was packed! So much so that you had to either order your food to go or wait until you noticed someone getting up to sit down. The size of the regular subs scared me a bit. They were huge, but I noticed that's what a lot of people had on their plates. I chose the mini/lunch portion. I got my cheesesteak sub with Provolone Cheese, grilled onion, mushrooms and sweet peppers. I also chose regular fried or sweet potato fries.   Immediately upon first bite I knew I made the wrong decision with getting the mini sub. It was absolutely divine. I'm not afraid to say this was the best cheesesteak sub I've had in Arizona. It damn sure taste like those cheesesteak subs back East. Hand down!"}
{"text":"Been here many times, food is decent but unimpressive and I feel it's a bit overpriced. Pair that with mediocre service and that is why I feel this place deserves a single star.  Phillies down the road is a cheaper, tastier alternative!"}
{"text":"Real good food but no 5 star bc priced pretty high to just get a sandwich with nothing else. But Philly is one of my favorites around. Lots of options"}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak in the valley and fast service as well! Kind of a hidden location but finally took up a friend's recommendation to check them out. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"First trip to Forefathers.  Very satisfied with the entire experience.  Friday at lunchtime.  Fast service.  I took several reviewers advice and ordered the number 1.  I made the mistake of ordering a large and could not finish the entire sandwich, but it was so good I almost made it through.  I don't know what other yelpers are talking about using pre-cooked meat.  They were grilling up fresh Porterhouse steaks while I watched.  Fry sauce is great. The food was great and the atmosphere was great.  The place was clean, including the bathrooms.  I will be back for more as soon as I recover from this food coma..."}
{"text":"This place makes the best cheesesteaks this side of the Mississippi. Every time I go, they seem to get better and better. I've tried about everyting on the menu, and you can't go wrong. The first time you go, you just have to order the Original. I suggest adding mushrooms and peppers, too.  The atmosphere is fun and inviting. You can tell all the people working there are enjoying themselves and everything is extremely clean! So great to see a place proudly displaying their love for our country, too. Check it out!"}
{"text":"My husband says this spot has the best original Philly Cheesesteak in AZ!! The sandwiches have a large amount of steak and the bread is moist. Great sandwiches and you gotta try the \"fry\" sauce! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has a pretty good cheesesteak. Now I am sure someone from Philly would probably lynch me for even thinking that but I said it. It's not the best in the world but for a cheesesteak place that is close to my work it is pretty good. It is a little on the expensive side but worth the price of admission. The regular size is perfect for lunch, get it OMG style onions mushrooms & green peppers. The large is just too much for me. The fries are good. The service is pretty quick. You do have to kind of yell your order a little. They have a good cheesesteak that is close to my work so I will be back a few times for lunch. Not everyday but a few times a month. Love me some cheesesteak."}
{"text":"This place is really good! First tried the cheesesteak and came back for the chicken they are both the best around that I could find. I recommend the chicken with and  add jalapeños."}
{"text":"So I heard really good things about this place... I have been looking for a good Philly Steak in AZ, and wow did I find the right one!   I walked in just before lunch time, and didn't have to wait in line I ordered #2 the Philly steak, and provolone wit onions.  I know cheese wiz is the way to go for a traditional cheese steak, but I am not a fan of cheese wiz in general; I prefer a better quality cheese like provolone. I decided to get the large, and a combo with fries, and drink. I looked down at the counter ready to pay, and I saw a huge awesome cookie. The guy at the register claimed they were good so I had to try it out.  The total for this gourmet meal was $15...  I got the order in under one minute. I was pleasantly surprised, but at the same cautious because the food came out so fast it would suffer in quality.  Boy I was wrong! The Philly Steak was one of the best I have had if not the best. The fries were amazing!. Make sure you get the \"fry sauce.\"  I washed it down with a coke, and finished it off with the giant cookie. The cookie was amazing.  The only negative thing I could say about this review is the price, but you get what you pay for, and I went all out. Look to spend about $8-$12 which is standard for a Philly Steak around this area."}
{"text":"Forefathers has a good cheese steak.  I'm yet to find one that is true Philly style, but this one comes close.  The first time I came here, I got the cheese steak with provolone, which was a mistake!  You have to get it with the cheese whiz or else you're not getting the full flavor and it's honestly really good.  The fries are fresh and crispy, made when you order them!  The fry sauce is actually very good, and I'm not a fry sauce person.  Lastly, you NEED to try the cookie.  OMG - it's is delicious, soft and fresh.  It's worth every penny.  Come and try this place out!  It's great for lunch, they are quick with their orders!"}
{"text":"This will be brief, because you don't have to say a lot about great. I am from Philadelphia, and lived there over half my life. For a good deal of the time I was in the food business, and I have made my share of cheesesteaks. I try not to gush in my reviews nor do I criticize if I can help it (having been on the other side, I know how it hurts). But after eating at Forefathers for the first time, I can tell you this: You can get on a plane and fly to Philly for a great cheesesteak, and I have been to all the places there, but you can get one just as good right here. They do everything right- the set-up, the bread, grill technique, the meat, all perfect, as are all the extras- fried onions, mushrooms, green peppers, and your choice of cheese. I recommend provolone, but you have to try \"Whiz\" at least once. When I saw the price (about $8) for a small sandwich, I thought it was a bit high- until I saw it. They really overstuff a 7\" roll. I haven't had a large sandwich yet (app. $11) but I plan to rectify that as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Overpriced: Not only the food itself but also the medical bill and the gym personal trainer bill you have to pay afterward."}
{"text":"I ordered an original w/wiz and fries for lunch. Cheesesteak was well packed with meat, but lacking in seasoning. The bread wasn't good at all. Tasted like it was pulled out of a bag (not fresh). They have jalapeños in a little fridge by the soda machines. Don't bother because they are the one's that come out of a can. Fries were perfection in my opinion.   Price was expensive for what was served. I wouldn't go out of my way for this place and have had better cheesesteak sandwiches elsewhere in the valley."}
{"text":"If you love a REAL Philly style Cheese steak then this IS THE PLACE! It's a local family owned spot on Priest near Warner. I HAVE to eat here anytime I am in the general area and I always get enough to take home. The cheese steaks reheat very well the next day.   If you are a vegetarian you can eat here too.. My daughter loves their grilled cheese, tomato bisque and veggie hoagie (mushrooms, onions, peppers, cheese on a nice fresh roll).  The salads are great and so are the regular and sweet potato fries. You have to try the fry sauce too and they even offer banana, sweet, and hot peepers on the side- FREE!   Last but not least the owner bakes the BEST chocolate chip cookies I have ever tasted. I get 2 every time... They are chewy and pretty large for under $1.   Bottom line.... Go here, support a local family owned business and taste the greatest cheese steak in the Valley"}
{"text":"The first time I went there was with my family. With three kids, we weren't sure what they would like and the guy behind the counter was super nice and very helpful. While we were eating, one of the boys said, \"This is my new favorite restaurant!\"   Try the big one with Cheeze Wiz, you can't go wrong. I also like the spicy Blue Cheese. Really good food and great service. The bread is super fresh, too!  Give 'em a try, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"The best cheese steaks I have ever had and in Arizona no less.  The employees are always super friendly and cheerful. Which is impressive for how busy they are always ( a sure sign they are awesome ).  They have everything from authentic cheese steaks ( yes with cheese whiz)  to customized ones of your choosing.  If you don't like cheese whiz ( for shame ) just order it with \"real\" cheese.  I have had the chicken and steak sandwiches and they are both fantastic.  When you go try the Pizza Steak with mozzarella,mushrooms and pepperonis (it's heaven on a bun) with a side of sweet potato fries you won't regret it."}
{"text":"We really wanted a good cheesesteak so I yelped and found this local business that had great reviews so we headed to Tempe to give it a try, I'm so glad I came here and tried it out! Very good cheesesteaks and the fries are great! The cheesesteaks come with grilled onions, mushrooms and green peppers and your choice of cheese wiz, white American, provolone, or mozzarella. Of course i chose the cheese wiz and it was yummy! They have steak and chicken to choose from. They also have small appetizers and salads."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat at. The cheesesteak is always so delicious and cooked perfectly. I also always receive amazing service when I visit! Not once have I been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Family is from Philly area so I know a good cheesesteak when I have one.  This place is great!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"When I want a cheesesteak, this is where I go.  There's usually a line, but it moves very quickly and the food comes out just as fast.  I've tried about every variation of sandwich you can try there and it's always been consistently great.  The employees are super friendly.  The fry sauce is good if you like sweet sauces.  The fries are good, just a little salt and whatever sauce you like and they are crispy and break up the heaviness of the steak.  I kind of like the cheese fries, but they get soggy and cold fast, so go at them right away!  I always know I see a regular when they're at a table with their fry sauces and other toppings all lined up and ready to go before they've even gotten their food.  The look of anticipation on their faces is always obvious, no matter how hard they try to look cool.  If you're in the area and want to try something new, something you won't find anywhere else near there, try this place.  Sometimes it gets full, so grab a table as soon as you see one, or you may have to sit outside.  Start with a regular cheesesteak before going for broke with the large.  I've never been able to finish a large and I'm a big boy.  Tip: try the tomato bisque, it seems out of place in a cheesesteak joint, but it's amazing."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town, and stopped in for a quick lunch. I was very impressed. Friendly staff, clean facilities, and amazing food! I have not has a cheese steak that good in a long time! Oh and the price is great for the food! 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Pretty good cheese steak, freshly made to order, fry sauce is a must however, little pricey for the size to be completely honest. But good food none the less"}
{"text":"We were in the area & decided to look on Yelp at what restaurants were nearby. Forefather's popped up at the top of the list & we saw that it had gotten pretty good reviews, so we decided to give it a try.  The gentleman at the cash register was really helpful & recommended the Steak Cheesesteak with Cheese Whiz, OMG! Style (with onions, mushrooms, & green peppers) and the Chicken Cheesesteak with Provolone, OMG! Style. We agreed & got those along with a side of fries. Their combo includes a free drink when you order a sandwich & any side.  The food came out really quickly & after only a couple of bites, it didn't seem worth it. Our combos were $11.25 each after tax ... Way overpriced. I only tried a bite of the steak so not much to comment about that but the chicken was cut too large & had no flavor ... the OMG didn't do much for it either. They had \"fry sauce\" too was basically just mayo & ketchup - not very impressive.  So, in conclusion: Was it bad? No, it wasn't bad; we ate what we ordered. Was it good? No, it wasn't good either ... and it was definitely nothing special where we will we return."}
{"text":"Recently started working in the area and wanting to find some place for lunch, Yelp'ed my way here and it didn't disappoint.  There wasn't any wait when I arrived as it's past lunch time crowd already.  Ordered large steak with everything and sweet potatoes fries, free drink thanks to the combo order.  The bread was very soft, much more tastier than Subway breads.  The meat was well seasoned with cheese mixed in throughout.  Sweet potato fries tasted great too.  This was my 1st time visiting this location and I can't wait to come back again soon."}
{"text":"Now this is a sandwich! I had the steak cheesesteak with everything on it and added buffalo sauce and it was a gooey amazing mess~but iin a great way of course like it should be. Fries and sweet potato fries were both great with their special fry sauce. It was packed at lunch but they were fast getting everything out which was nice being in a crunch ourselves to get back to work. Outside seating was nice on a sunny 70 degree day. There are lots of menu choices so I will be back to perfect my cheesteak though it was pretty darn good the first time!"}
{"text":"Pretty authentic place. Great food and atmosphere. Give it a try!  The cheese steaks are very flavorful and the ordering process is simple with only a few things in the menu."}
{"text":"I spent the last two years in Philadelphia and moved here a month ago. Have been to all the greats Jim's, Geno's, Pats and Tony Luke's. Forefathers is not going to beat any of these places, but it is a very nice copy of the originals. The meat is similar but they chop it up into smaller pieces here. Also they put the wiz on the bun and on top so there is good cheese to meat ratio happening. The bun could be more \"crusty\" for my liking but it did the job. I would recommend this place to anyone that wants to get a good cheesesteak but it will not be the same as the Great ones."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a real cheesesteak, this place is right for you.  I was particularly impressed by the customer service.  When I ordered, the people behind the counter were very helpful.  The cook helped me narrow down my options when I asked what I would enjoy.  The cashier said, \"Good choice; the pizza cheesesteak is great!\"    And I made the joke, \"I'm starving...so it'd better be.\"  And the cashier told me that if I didn't enjoy it, he would make me something else.  That was good customer service...but it got better.  After a couple of minutes of eating, the cashier walked by to ask me if the sandwich was as good as he said it was.  The food was just a bit better than average, but the people that work there make it an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Artery clogging goodness.  I recommend the #1 with pizza fries."}
{"text":"I don't get the fuss.  I love cheesesteaks, and these are pretty average.  The contents are good, the buns aren't anything to write home about, and the prices are so-so.  I've had better cheesesteaks in the mall--and that's saying something.  Being from the Bay Area (and those of you from there know where I'm talking about).. it's really hard to find a great cheesesteak compared to a wonderful chain there.  I moved to Tempe a month ago, and I'm still on the hunt for a great cheesesteak.  Forefathers didn't quite do it for me."}
{"text":"We have loved the food here from the restraunt opening. We are regulars. Great Philly sandwich and fries."}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat, with fast service and hot food. I got a regular cheesesteak with OMG added onto it. The bun was warm and soft but with a little crunch, with the chicken being extremely good in pieces and mixed in with the selection of cheese I wanted."}
{"text":"This is my third time here and my first time writing a review. I must say that the first time I came here I was amazed by the menu and delicious food. This was a couple years ago. Fast forward to today and I must say I am quite disappointed. Fries are as tasty as I remember but the sandwich is lacking for me. I see they got rid of the special subs menu which I look forward to finding out which one I am craving but today I leave wanting something else. It still is a nice place to come to but not the gourmet sub that I come looking for."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The cheesesteak is hands down the best in the Phx area.  Even the chicken cheesesteak sandwiches are amazing.  Hard to choose when you go, that's for sure!  Don't miss their fry sauce or the pizza fries.  MMMMMM!!!!  Oh and get some cookies.  Gooey deliciousness!"}
{"text":"My top spot in the valley for a cheesesteak. Excellent food that will make you want more. Friendly staff, clean facility and good music. Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Great cheese steaks and great sweet potato fries! And the fry sauce is awesome too. I just want to know one thing.  What's with the pictures of the cows?"}
{"text":"As a transplant from NJ I'm always on the hunt for a good cheesesteak. It's only taken 9 years for me to find a place that finally serves good south Jersey cheesesteaks. Forefathers has the right rolls, the correctly shaved steak and offers both a Philly style (cheezwiz) or NJ style (American cheese). I'm hooked."}
{"text":"The Forefather's foodtruck came to Siena Apartments today so we went to check it out. The owner/manager that was runni g the table was the worst representative as he proceeded to shamelessly plug the restaurant and how the food was \"way better than everyone else doing it\". Not only did he overly hype the lacklustre food, but he tried to persuade us to coerce the friend driving to get out and buy something. Rude, pushy and annoying. The food was disappointing as well. The $10 buys a soggy breaded 7\" cheesesteak and lukewarm/stale waffle cut chips that may have been ok fresh. Pro tip: Don't plug the high quality of your cheesesteaks if you still feel the need to attempt to convince people the cheez wiz is the best one and list it as your special."}
{"text":"Best Cheesesteaks in the Valley!! Recently discovered this place and I'm addicted and embarrassed to tell my coworkers where I'm going to lunch all the time. Must try this local restaurant!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Being from the Philly area and growing up eating and loving Philly cheesesteaks nothing ever compared out here.... Until we found this place. Phenomenal cheesesteak with cheese wiz is the way too go. Though all of the different ways are phenomenal! The sweet potato fries are great. And the fry sauce (I always did this after a friend of mine moved from Utah why we were kids). I find excuses to drive to Tempe just to get a cheesesteak. Must go!! Love this place"}
{"text":"Being from just a little north of Philly, cheese steaks were a child hood staple.  I haven't any place any better than Forefathers for a good cheese steak (although I would be willing to try)  It's a quaint little place that doesn't go all out in decor, which is fine considering I'm used to some of the best cheesesteaks coming out of a cart.  They don't go all out in trying to impress you with the ambiance because they dump everything into what is most important, the food.  The sandwiches are incredible, and they offer a range of options and they are flat priced, $6.95 for a regular and $9.50 for a large.  The regular, with a side is a match for just about anyone.... want left overs or skipped a few days of eating then go for the large.  They offer salads and some other things, but I'm a meat and potato guy so I've never ventured passed the steaks and cheese fries.    All the subs are flavorly dressed just by themselves, but there are options for adding more, extra cheese, mushrooms, etc. (the add-on prices are very fair)  They brag that they aren't cheap on the meat and in their case, it is very true.  Plus the sandwiches are put together with perfect ratios so no one flavor is overwhelming another.  I also like that you can get sweet peppers, banana peppers, and other things like their \"fry sauce\" from a small fridge in the lobby... yeah, its open house, so no one looking down at you condescendingly when you grab a handful of pepper containers.  In the few times I've gone, I've learned my lesson, if you want to grab lunch during the work week, you've got to make it in by 1120am.... wait any longer and it gets packed quick."}
{"text":"This is one of our most favorite places to eat. The lunch crowd is huge so give it a try in the evening if it's your first time. (bit they close at 8 I believe) The original with cheese wiz is the best! Be sure to try the sweet potato fries and the fry sauce is delicious! Insider tip, when picking up your food, ask for jalepeno ranch. It's by request only, no charge, and it is phenomenal with fries! You get a free drink with a cheese steak and side. Staff is always friendly and happy."}
{"text":"First time here.  The ordering was easy, food came out quickly. Had a regular steak, white American, mushrooms and drizzle of cheese Whiz.  Side of fries to round it out.  The fries were hot and crispy, nicely seasoned.  They stayed hot through the meal.  The sandwich was awesome!"}
{"text":"I am in LOVE with Forefathers!!! The food is constantly good, the service is fast, and the quality of food is amazing. I would eat here daily if my wife and waistline would let me."}
{"text":"As usual, the BOM!!! So good. I drive from Laveen just for Awesome Cheesesteak Sandwich. Cant beat it in AZ.. Fast Service, clean, good prices, Great Food and ambiance."}
{"text":"Simply delicious! With there smart choice of using sirloin beef and there amazing salad flavors I can't get enough! My husband and I tried this for the first time 2/18 and with him being a Philly native he is very picky of his steaks. But as soon as we walked through the door he looks at me and tells me \"smells like home\". RIGHT AWAY we order and our 2 Philly cheese steaks OMG style And couldn't wait for our anticipated meal to arrive. Once we passed the sauce station, which might I add is quite extensive and has a great array of flavors,(Jalapeño cilantro ranch,like yummm!) we took our seats. With in a minute we had our first bite of heaven. The bread was soft with just the right amount of toasted crunch. The PROVALONE cheese was glued to the sirloin steak and along with it came the the omg flavors! ABSOLUTELY A NIRVANA MOMENT! Thank you forefathers for bringing my husband back to his home town with out ever leaving the city! I highly recommend you visit atleast once while in tempe!  Totally worth it!  The people are very nice and love to see the customers enjoy there craft."}
{"text":"If you're not in Philly, it's not a Philly cheese steak.  That said, Forefathers is as close to a Philly steak as I've had outside PA.  A little high priced, but so is everything else in the Valley."}
{"text":"My husband is from Philly and a major cheesesteak snob...and he won't go anywhere but Forefathers! The cheesesteaks are AMAZING; the fresh meat sliced and cooked to perfection and just oozing with cheese or cheese wiz. As for the sides,  I am partial to the sweet potato fries with their homemade (complimentary) honey mustard sauce, and the hubby enjoys their regular fries with the homemade fry sauce. Although, the fries are not the reason you go to this place.  Great service and fabulous food. Somewhat of an obscure location, so I certainly hope that business is steady enough to keep the place around for the long haul. It was so good that we went here twice in the week that we first tried it.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Good cheese steak place. Good bread, meat and has the Wiz so its gotta be good. fries are good especially the sweet potato.   A lil too pricey but good overall and quick."}
{"text":"Honestly.. What's up with everyone's amazing reviews.. I got two sandwiches no sides no drinks and it was 24$ bucks.. Imagine if I got a side of fries with that. The food wasn't even that good. For only having cheese steaks your food better be amazing. That's like In N out they have just burgers and there food is amazing. Come on.. It's alright but you can go to jersey mikes and it would honestly taste better then this place."}
{"text":"Hey now, let's watch that young energetic staff at Fakefathers dump those \"great\" fries out of their respective bags into the oil (that includes the sweet potato variety). Now, let's watch the cook take inferior meat that has already been chopped up and is waiting in bins and dump it onto the grill with the pre-cut and measured onions and peppers and voila your sandwich is ready in 2.5 minutes. I want my freakin steak to start red and get cooked on the grill you idiots.  Ok, now let's pay $8 for a tiny sandwich that uses SIRLOIN steak, not ribeye and be happy about life. Nah, let's just call this place what it is:  a ripoff, a place that uses cheap ingredients to make a profit on the poor customers of Phoenix, who don't ask questions and assume because they throw alot of cheap meat into the bun, it must be worth the price.      Some folks take cheesesteak seriously and no lazy establishment is getting my cash these days. There was nothing to these sandwiches. no flavor and using sirloin is basically the equivalent of buying a pack of Steak-umm's and making these yourself at home. Garbage, overpriced cheap steak and frozen potatoes....enjoy your meal at FAKEfathers."}
{"text":"So it is hard to find a cheese steak that is close to the ones you get in Philly.  This place is one of the closest you will get.  Go with a wiz wit, or provy wit and add wiz.  One of the problems with most cheese steaks is the bread.  Forefathers has a really good bread that actually mimics the bread you get in Philly.  The fries are also some of the best I've had in AZ.  They are nice and crispy like they are double fried.  And the plus is they are quick.  Even when they are busy, you can still eat lunch and get back to work."}
{"text":"The guys are great here and service excellent. This is THE place to stuff your face with yummy philly chz steak with spicy blue chz sauce dripping down your chin and feel at home."}
{"text":"Best in the valley for sure! Great cheese stakes and amazing buffalo chicken salads! Great food and great service! Don't look any further!"}
{"text":"One time I came here in the dead of the lunch rush and my food was ready before I filled my Coke. So fast. So good. Nice people, the owner especially is a really great dude! Best cheesesteak I've ever had, any cheese is a amazing but I default to whiz and onions. Chicken phillys are amazing and they have everything on the menu you would want. Perfect fries every time. My family would drink the tomato Parmesan vinaigrette. Go here you goof. They're masters of their craft and if they ever expand I would love one in the Chandler or Gilbert area, but please just keep doing what you do, you brighten up my work day more than any other restaurant I go to."}
{"text":"Forefathers always seems to be one of those places that I forget about until someone else suggests it.  Of course, when they do suggest it, I feel like smacking myself in the forehead . . . \"Forefathers!  Of course!  Why didn't I think of that!\"  I'm hoping that the more I go, the more Forefathers will stay top of mind and I will remember them when we're looking for a quick, yummy meal.  I have been a few times now and have to say the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is one of my favorite sandwiches! The bread is soft, the chicken is huge chunks of breast meat, the blue cheese and celery add the creamy and the crunch.  I usually stick to the smaller \"regular\" sandwich, and avoid the large size.  I can't bring myself to try anything else, even though I'm sure it would be delicious.  Good sweet potato fries and regular fries, too. Fry sauce and peppers (sweet, hot, and banana) available in single serving containers in a mini fridge by the drink fountain. Good iced tea, too! I like my tea unsweetened, but this one has a perfect hint of sweet.  The last time I was there I really wanted to try the tomato basil soup and a grilled cheese, but the buffalo chicken philly was calling to me!  The staff is friendly and always ready with a smile.  The place is clean and appears well-maintained.  I hear this place gets busy during the weekday lunch with all the Intel peeps coming over.  I have only been in the evenings and it's pretty quiet.  I am glad they are so busy at lunch; I wouldn't want them shutting down on me like so many other establishments have recently.  One of these days, I'll have to try something other than the Buffalo Chicken Philly . . . we'll see.  Why mess with perfection?"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Their cheesesteak sandwiches are really good but honestly the best part is their french fries! I LOVE French fries but not all fries are made equally delicious and some are just bad...Seriously though, the best french fries that I've ever had in my entire life! Perfect crunchiness and perfect saltiness  plus they have special fry sauce thats bomb! Love this place. Definitely reccomend!"}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak in town.  The meat is always moist an flavorful, the bread is always soft, and the restaurant is always clean.  You get a ton of food for the price of the meal and you would spend just as much anywhere else for a similar meal at any other sandwich shop.  I enthusiastically recommend this place to anyone looking for a great cheesesteak."}
{"text":"Great cheesesteaks! They have Cheez Whiz !! I have been searching for the best cheesesteak in Phoenix and I think I found it. Staff was very friendly. They have chicken cheesesteaks and even stuff for the kids and vegetarians (soup, grilled cheese, salads). Staff is attentive, place is clean, they move you thru quickly cause it can get crowded at lunch time. Some tables outside which is nice when the weather accommodates.  Stuffed fairly generously with steak. The regular was plenty with a side of fries. Can get regular or sweet potatoe fries. Fry sauce was just okay. Not as good as I had in Utah."}
{"text":"Nice little spot, good food & service. It's just to expensive for me. $13 for a combo meal! Yikes!"}
{"text":"First time visiting and pleasantly surprised at how good it was! Service was great, we were given suggestions while ordering which I always appreciate when visiting for the first time. Our food was made fresh and was ready quickly. I ordered sweet potato fries, which is typically hit or miss...but these were perfect. Thin and crispy, seasoned well. The sandwich roll was soft and chewy, held up well to the amount of filling in the sandwich."}
{"text":"Fast and tasty. Best cheese steak in town. Great if you don't have much time for lunch. Check them out."}
{"text":"The place was cool, clean, nice people working there BUT the meat had 0 flavor! I can't eat a philly sandwich that's so bland that I need to drown it in cheese whiz. I'm sorry but no. The fries and fry sauce were good though so there's that."}
{"text":"Yummy and fast! I have not been disappointed by this restaurant. I had mini cheese steak with provolone onions mushrooms peppers, and then I put a bunch of sweet tangy peppers on it! You can't go wrong with that! Regular fries are okay, but sweet potato fries are super good! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times when I used to live in Az. I just never really put in my 2 cents about this place, but it is amazing!! I've been here with friends that are from Philly that compare it to all the great cheesesteak places over there and they said its just as great. Also I've never been disappointed in the service or the quality of the food. Yes at times you'll be dealing with a line but its not as bad only 5-10minute at max. Definitely a very friendly establishment.   I've try all the other sandwiches but I still think the original is the best. The meat was always cook just right, still tender and was never dry. Having good bread is also another key to a good cheesesteak sandwich and it wasn't disappointing at all. Pair it up with a side of sweet potato fries and your good to go! This place won't disappoint you! When I make my way back to Az for whatever reasons that is. This is definitely one of the places on my list that I'll be making a stop at."}
{"text":"I've had many Philly Cheese steaks and this place was ok. That's all I can not the best but ok"}
{"text":"Overrated for sure. Low grade ingredients, served with a smile. Really the employees are very friendly,  but they seam unaware of the pour quality of the food they are serving at relatively high prices.  With fries in the name, I thought this joint would have some good fries, they where straight out of the freezer.  This place also needs a deep cleaning.  I think the floors are the type that never look very clean, so they need constant attention.  The vent in the bathroom is a tell tale sign of overall lack of attention to cleaning details not to mention the drink station. Being from Philadelphia does make me critical of the steak, but most of my review is not steak related.  I give the steak 3 stars; the roll being the closest I have found in the valley to right, but the meat... for get about it."}
{"text":"You know, I had this place built up in my mind to something that's better than it actually is.  Now, don't get me wrong, these cheesesteaks are better than those you'll get at a mall food court, but like those in south Philly, they are not.  The last time I was here I was really thinking I'd have a delicious sandwich, and it was ok, but really had no flavor.  I always get mine with everything minus green peppers, and provolone for the cheese.  The meat was tender, bread soft, but the sandwich had absolutely no flavor.  None.  Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but I think I've satisfied my cravings for Forefathers and will wait til my next trip to Philly to have another cheesesteak.    OH!  And I can't believe I almost forgot this, but I always get a kick out of the fact that this place is always full of dudes.  Always.  Single ladies, if you like a meat-eating man, get your carnivore on and go cruise this joint.  You will be WAY outnumbered."}
{"text":"Decent enough. I'd stop by again if I were hungry and it was nearby. Good service as well."}
{"text":"Forefathers Gourmet cheesesteaks & Fries rocks! This has become our new go-to place at least once a week. We live just a couple blocks from here, and love it.   Prices are kind of up there for fast-food sandwiches, but you get what you pay for. It's quality all the way. We usually get the large chicken cheesestake wit onions and whiz, and it's so big, we split it. Yum. Fries are awesome too!   Only complaint: closes at 8 p.m. Mon-Sat, and at 5 p.m. on Sun. Often on Sat's we're not thinking of dinner until 8-ish, and 5p.m. is kinda soon for Sun. Reminds me of Costco hours. Can't blame 'em, as they are probably family-owned.. but please think about staying open until 8:30 or 9 on Sat and maybe 6 on Sun. :)"}
{"text":"Nothing about it was good for me, but everything about it was good!  My friends have been raving about Forefather's for the past year and despite working less than a mile away I hadn't tried it.  Being a vegetarian I figured there would be nothing for me to eat.  I was wrong, they have a nice salad menu (that can be modified) and their tomato soup and grilled cheese is fantastic!  I wanted to try the sweet potato fries, but couldn't possibly put one more thing in my stomach.  The place is nothing fancy, order your food at the counter, and pick it up at the counter, but the service was still great.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the mood for some greasy comfort food."}
{"text":"Forefathers has a great atmosphere and even better food. The steak with OMG and fry sauce is amazing. Be warned though, the large is LARGE. Go hungry and you'll leave happy."}
{"text":"Love this place !! Go here twice a week for lunch ! Food is always good and they have the best sweet potato fries !!"}
{"text":"went here for mid week lunch.  the ordering, and service was quite fast and friendly.  I went steak, whiz and onions peppers and shrooms plus fries.  at 12$ that's pushing my lunch price tag.  but the food is arguably worth it.  good steak, little light on the whiz for my liking and a nice firm bread.  the only downside was that by the time I was finishing my lunch the last few bites of bread were completely soaked.    ultimately, if I'm west of the 101 I'd go here for my cheesesteak fix.  for what it's worth, the biggest difference I noticed here was the bread density. definitely more dense and chewier than the Philly place on Alma school."}
{"text":"So good!! Very Friendly staff welcoming and super nice. Food was soooooo good! Fry sauce is really good! Philly Cheesesteak delicious and their fries are on point!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you're just in the mood for a cheesesteak. It's not healthy. You know it's not healthy. But a well-made Philly cheesesteak is a thing of beauty. And when it hits the spot, that spot stays hit.   Forefathers makes the best ones I've had. I like Capriotti's, but Forefathers is the reigning champ for me. Lots of meat, thick slices of mushroom, plenty of Cheez Whiz, and soft, delicious bread. Good fries, too!  If you go for lunch, go early or call ahead. The place has a long line, which is generally a good sign."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and was always happy with the food, until my last few visits. I'm not sure what has happened but the cheese steak does not taste like it used to. It's now not very flavorful.  It's always been high priced and I didn't mind, but I do now since it seems the quality has gone down.  Not sure if I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I love forefathers !!! Great cheesesteaks and fries...I take all vistors in town to this place and they love it as well...fast friendly service and great food keep me comming back over and over"}
{"text":"Update!  So I have been coming here more and more. The soup is amazing the sandwiches are good and fresh. So far no issues of course it's pricey but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Come hungry, they're very big. Excellent bread, quality meat without loads of fat in it, options for cheese and toppings. Tried the Wiz topping for the first time. It adds creaminess to it but probably won't be my first choice unless I'm in the mood. We each special ordered our meals and they were accurate. Fries are coated which I liked but isn't my husband favorite. Tea wasn't great but that's minor issue. Restaurant was clean, service fast and friendly. We will be back."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak I've had so far in the East Valley!  The bread, the whiz, the meat and the onions are all just right.  It's a little pricey, but well worth it!  The service here is amazingly fast, which seems to be a rare thing in AZ(I'm originally from Chicago).  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Its pretty decent.  Good flavor on the meat.  The bread can be a little chewier and well.. better.  But not too shabby at all.  Sweet potato fries are good though more slivery than a fry.  Not sure about the fry sauce that everyone raved about.  It might taste better on a regular fry.  Anyway, love the idea of the condiment fridge where guests can help themselves to peppers and such.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Great for a quick cheesesteak sandwich! Awesome frys too!  There are lots of great options with. Here's, dips, peppers, shrooms and more! In Tempe now but coming to scottsdale. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Best cheesesteaks I've ever had here in Arizona. Had a foot long OMG! with cheeze wiz which I unfortunately had to share with the wife. The fries were also great along with the fry sauce and jalapeño cilantro ranch. Great stuff!"}
{"text":"My only complaint is that i devoured a large cheesesteak with everything on it in less than 45 seconds. It was that good. Only inprovement incan think of is dont dice the veggies because it hides their flavor, for example i didnt taste any mushrooms and thats my favorite part. Cheese was abdundant enough but if you really dont give a F about your diet, get the extra cheese and live a little. Oh and the fry sauce! BOMB.COM. think Raising Canes but it adds a killer tang to the sammy. 11/10 woupd smash again"}
{"text":"How have I waited so long to eat here?    Service was the only mediocre part.  Not overly helpful or friendly however it was efficient.  Cheesesteak was delicious.  Fries were good.  Drink is free.  Loved sitting outside to enjoy lunch.  Look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Really good cheesesteak sandwiches. Nice service but wish the fries tasted better.  But overall good place."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place on complete and total accident while working down in Tempe some 5 years ago. Best accident I have ever made. I live in freaking Glendale but work all over the valley, whenever I have work in Tempe, Chandler, Mesa, Sun Lakes, or Gilbert I make this my lunch stop. Or if my wife wants to visit IKEA, I say 'screw the meatballs, we're going to Forefathers!' This place has ridiculously good tasting food, plain and simple. Anyone I have recommended it to has come away a die hard fan. I have had nearly every thing they offer and could not pick a favorite off the menu, everything is amazing. The only thing I have not tried is the chicken because 'why would I get chicken at a philly cheese steak place??' But most of my friends who have had it say it is equally amazing. Simply put, if you enjoy eating animals, then you owe it to yourself to try eating here, your tastebuds will not regret it."}
{"text":"Now thats a steak sandwich. Very fast and affordable. I was visiting from montana and needed something fast so i could make my tee time. Took 2 min tops to get my food. Didnt have to ask for fry sauce or extras as they were in the lobby waiting for us. The manager took time to ask us where we were from and how our trip was. For a new shop they are doing it right."}
{"text":"I love the food here and the service is friendly and top notch.    Bit pricey at $10 and change for a regular cheesesteak, fries, and a drink."}
{"text":"This is the second try for this place, and while I will give them credit that the taste is good, but the prices make it not a good value. The pictures are deceiving, since the rolls are very skinny. $12 for a sandwich is just to much, unless it's huge.  That may play in NY where everything is expensive, but not here in Arizona. I'm still looking for a good value Cheesesteak, and a good value Italian Beef. The loss of Lobby's in Tempe still hurts."}
{"text":"Yassssssssssssssss mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm! So delicious I dream of these cheese steaks! I wiggle in my chair!!!"}
{"text":"Large steak with Cheese Whiz - Pretty good and large portion size  Sweet Potato Fries - Small portion but very good (best part of the meal) Tea - Horrible, they can do better than this for sure  Jalapeños - Out of a can / taste like they belong on nachos / skip these  Fry Sauce -  Thousand Island dressing, pretty commonplace  Price - Overpriced would be generous   I really don't see myself going back here again. The price is ridiculous at nearly $18 for the meal. I really don't see my opinion changing unless they get that price down to a reasonable level. If you have some money to burn for a good cheese steak, and you are in the area, I guess this is a possibility."}
{"text":"My entire family is from the Philadelphia area, so we know cheesesteaks. All of us agree that Forefathers has the best cheesesteaks that any of us have had in Arizona-- they definitely rival the famous Pat's and Geno's cheesesteaks. The bread is fresh baked daily, the meat is great quality, and the portions are generous. Ask for their fry sauce on your sandwich (they'll put it on for you at no extra charge), and get a side of sweet potato fries to dip into the fry sauce, too. Mmm, food heaven!"}
{"text":"These are the best cheesesteaks that you can find in the valley. They taste pretty close to the ones from philly. Always get it with the cheez wiz.  Also get the cheese fries too. All the cheesy goodness!"}
{"text":"Cheesesteak was excellent the fries were awesome staff was friendly. Too bad there is non on the west side but I'd definitely stop by if I'm out that way again."}
{"text":"Tried something out of the norm. Regular cheesesteak, mozzarella & drizzle of cheezwhiz w/jalapeño (of course!), with a side of fries & a drink to clearly complete the meal. Overall it was good. *one shoulder shrug* I appreciate the fries staying crunchy long enough for me to get back to my desk and eat. I'm assuming the foil helps with that? Tea - meh. It said black tea but tastes like blueberry. Which was an okay taste, but not what I thought I was getting. 3 stars from me simply because I feel it's over priced. $13 for this meal......I'd be back if it was closer to $8."}
{"text":"Oh my deity, this place is (insert version of pleasant afterlife)!  I took an Ikea trip with the wife and have not been to many places in the desert where they offer cheez whiz as the choice of cheese. I jumped at this seemingly rate opportunity and it made a world of difference. My wife was surprised to find a low carb option and went for that with the tomato bisque soup. Also a win the fries are great, they offer fry sauce. I was in love. I need to find a similar spot in Tucson (or hope they plan to expand soon)."}
{"text":"Not my favorite. The cheese steak was way too cheesy. The steak was completely lost in the cheese wiz. Good amount of steak but again not my favorite especially @ a $9.95 price for a large. The sweet potato fries with the fry sauce was good. I'm still on the hunt for the best cheese steak in the valley!"}
{"text":"I usually make it a point to never order a cheese steak anywhere...except when I'm actually in Philadelphia. I mean, once you taste of the perfection that is a genuine steak sandwich (wit wiz) from Philly, you realize how far short everything else measures up. There's usually no point in bothering with any of the \"authentic\" \"original\" blah blah blah cheese steak travesties that are dished up anywhere west of the Appalachians. Seriously. Well, that was until today. I finally found a place that got it right. This is as close as it gets to the real thing (close, not exact). And how I was delighted to fill my belly with its meaty cheesy goodness! Mmm!  I ordered the Regular sized Philly Original (exactly like I order it back in Philly actually). It's got meat, grilled onions, and cheese wiz; that's it! That's all that's supposed to be on there as far as I'm concerned. It was all cooked to perfection too. The bun was almost perfect--something about the texture was slightly off from the real deal, but it was still the best you're gonna get around here. I ordered fries with my sandwich too. They tasted like they were double fried (and I mean that as a good thing) because they were extra crispy. Overall, I left full and satisfied. I'll be back. Bravo to Forefathers! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place is freakin' awesome  OMG.  It's like their sprinkle their fries with cocaine as a seasoning.  They're sooooooooo good.  Especially dipped in cheese.  I especially love the buffalo chicken philly sandwich.  It's chicken, hot sauce, spicy blue cheese and celery all melted together in bread.  YUM.  I would like to try everything they have on their menu.  It's awesome."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times on my trips to phoenix and I have to say that this is the best cheesesteak I have ever eaten.   Fast and friendly service and great food. The rolls that the steak comes on are really really good and the meat with the cheese whiz is great. I love this place and there sweet potato frys.  If you want a great experience come here!!!!!"}
{"text":"As a teen, I work at a Philly hoagie shop and this is one of the best I have had since then.  I do get a bit freaked out on the cheesewhiz, so provolone it is for me. Mushrooms, onions, and jalapenos. They put cheese on the meat and bread on top for the flip(the heat softens the bread). Fries & sauce was good too! Staff was polite and nice. Price is good for the quality and quantity of what we got.. ended up in a food coma.  Will come back everytime we are on this side of town!"}
{"text":"I am not big on cheesesteaks. Okay, let me rephrase. I was not big on cheesesteaks. Where were these my whole life?!?! One of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic cheesesteak sandwiches! Every bite is better than the first!  Fresh salads with homemade dressings. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Seriously so good! I got the cheesesteak with cheese wiz and onions with a side of sweet potato fries and it was delicious!! You have to come by here and try it out!! So bomb!   By the way, service here is awesome too. Check them out!"}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars because I don't know of any other places with good Philly cheese steak sammiches. Their cheese steak with whiz is great as is the chicken Reuben cheese steak. There is also a good amount of meat in their sandwiches and the bread is soft and fresh. I personally think the regular size is enough for me. I love their fry sauce and their sweet potato fries. Their regular fries are not anything to get excited about though. Prices are decent and the service is quick as well"}
{"text":"I could take it or leave it. I do think \"Gourmet\" is false advertising.  Cheesesteaks really aren't my thing to begin with so y'all can take my review with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteaks around! The sweet potato fries are tasty and go deliciously with the meal. Order with a side of fries and they throw in a drink. Can't go wrong. The chicken buffalo style is a favorite. I order for our department lunch about once a month. Call in your order, I was told someone is there at 6AM! This way they can have it ready when you arrive."}
{"text":"Wow.  This was an awesome cheese steak.  The menu is really simple but if you want cheese steak this is it.  The cheese steaks were delicious and the service was great.  I don't live on this side of town but when out shopping near by i will be back for more."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly staff, and freaking delicious food! Go here, thank me later! I got a mini cheesesteak with white American (wish I would have gotten cheese wiz), onions, and bell peppers. I got the Jalapeño cilantro ranch on the side, and dipped my fries and my cheesesteak in it. Yum!!"}
{"text":"This place is the shit for Cheesesteak in the Phoenix/Tempe area, I am not sure there is anything that could match it! I always get the phili original w/ grilled onions, you know the works. The prices are a little high, from what I recall, 8$ for a 6 inch, and I always get fries because their fry sauce is simply amazing, so Ill spend around $13 if I get the 6 inch meal which comes with fries and a drink. Their condiments are all fresh tasting (banana peppers, etc) and atmosphere and decor is modern looking.   Staff is very friendly and service is quick. I highly recommend checking this place out if you dont mind paying a little on the expensive end for cheesesteaks."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my guilty pleasure! The Cheesesteaks... Are AMAZING! They are so good that I usually end up eating the wrapper after I'm done lol. I have been to Pat's and Geno's in Philadelphia and I have to say that Forefathers are almost better then the original cheesesteak restaurants. You must get the Cheese Wiz on your steak it's a MUST!"}
{"text":"The staff is great, the cheesesteaks are the gold standard of cheesesteaks I've found! You won't be sorry! Salads are good too!"}
{"text":"Wow.  I've had cheesesteaks all over the country. I've had the originals (Genos, Jims, Pats). I've had every cheesesteak location in Washington state, and up and down the east coast (I travel for work). Upon hitting this location today (appropriately named, paying homage to the philly originals) this place not only pays homage in name, but in style, quality, and taste. EVERY single base is covered. From the type of bread, the way it's done. It was absolutely mouth watering and the closest I have tasted to the originals. I found it pleasant that they offered hearty salads and sandwiches and tomato bisque soup for those cold days. But what do you REALLY come here for? That's right, the cheesesteaks.  My only quip, is bring in tastykakes for the dessert and you've got philly covered."}
{"text":"After shopping IKEA we found this nearby hotspot. Come ready for cheesesteak because the menu is very simple. Choose your size, meat, toppings and if you want fries. That's about it. Simple and sweet. The place is clean and the service is enthusiastic. Also, the portions ensure a good value."}
{"text":"Really amazing Cheesesteaks!  A choice of all the 'correct' cheeses (depending on which side of Philly you come from)...option to add jalapenos made my husband thrilled (he spent too many years eating cheesesteaks in Texas).  Good chewy bread that doesn't overwhelm the meat.  And we LOVE the lighter portion option...great price for a very reasonable amount of food.  Will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Simple menu. Delicious food. Reasonably priced. Did take out for lunch today and went with the classic Philly steak sandwich with the wiz, onions, peppers, and mushrooms. Super tasty. Seasoned well. Just the right amount. Really hit the spot.  Didn't really care for the fries? Tasted like they had been fried in old oil.   Will be back for sure to try the chicken.   I need a nap now."}
{"text":"First visit and I was not disappointed. Easy menu and loved that they had sweet potato fries. If you go, I highly recommend the Fry sauce. It went well with regular fries and the sweet potato fries. Doing my best to try new restaurants and Forefathers did not disappoint. Our cashier even complimented my Harry Potter tattoo :) Very friendly! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"You won't be disappointed!!! Tony and Mary Crump have created a great restaurant  with an incredible staff. The food is delicious!  Have the original with fries. it's the best Cheesesteak in the valley!"}
{"text":"Looking for good Philadelphia street eats? Well, Forefathers Cheesesteaks & Fries is the place for you!  While Forefathers' is light on Philadelphia decor like the Liberty Bell, the sandwiches would give fan favorite Philly restaurants like Pat's, Geno's or Jim's a run for their money. And you don't have to be a Cheese Whiz fan. The gooey provolone on my sandwich left my mouth watering. The sweet potato fries were equally good. Be sure to sample the available dipping sauces like ranch, honey mustard, or (my fave) fries sauce.  The next time you're in the mood for cholesterol count busting goodness, be sure to check this place out. Even Ben Franklin wouldn't need his bifocal specs to see that Forefathers is worth a fry...oops, I mean, try."}
{"text":"I went here and had very good large Cheesesteak with provolone and cheese whiz which was delicious. I also had Buffalo chicken strips and they were ok. Prices are around $9 -11 for sandwiches and other stuff varies. I recommend Cherry peppers with Cheesesteak sandwich. Friendly staff and quick. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best cheese steak in the valley.  I pretty much order the same thing every time I go...the Regular Cheese steak with Wiz, OMG (onion, mushroom, green pepper) and sweet potato fries (and you get the drink for free when you order a side).  You HAVE to try their fry sauce...I could drink that stuff straight!  This is one of the few places that I get cravings for."}
{"text":"Best damn cheesesteaks this part of the east valley."}
{"text":"Ok I've been getting my cheesesteaks here for some time now . They really do have real authentic cheesesteaks here .. Meat is so yummy and the bread they use is awesome ! I would recommend this soot to anyone ! PS , try the fry sauce !!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! If you want to be lame and not try their sandwiches, I highly recommend their steak salad if you are a little more calorie conscious. The steak still taste amazing and they have this ranch dressing with jalapenos...mmmmm and don't forget about getting a cookie."}
{"text":"It was rather plan more healthy then greasy. I wanted my bread grilled and the told me it wasn't a good idea to do that. I dont understand why. But all in all it wasn't gourmet at all. Nothing fancy about the whole place. I would just come out and say lets go to fore fathers"}
{"text":"Outstanding cheesesteaks.  Nothing but good experiences here.  While you may spend more than you planned for lunch, the portions are quite large.  Always a good choice."}
{"text":"I am no expert when it comes to Philly cheesesteaks so keep that in mind as you read this review. For me this has got to be the best I have had in Phoenix. Delicious cheesesteak and they have cheese whiz. My wife had a cheese whiz steak with mushrooms, onions, and hot peppers. Accompanied with a side of sweet potato fries. It was delicious. I ordered the same but substituted white American for the cheese whiz. It was wonderful. People there are super chill. Great place IMO. It's a must try!!"}
{"text":"This place is legit! I don't know why I haven't reviewed this earlier seeing how its one of my favorite places!! Everything is fresh and tasty. I love the fry sauce, I end up putting it on everything. It's a little pricey for a walk up counter but the ingredients are quality. You get what you pay for. Side note, I came in here one time 15-20 minutes before closing and still got fresh hot food, and the staff was amazing. They didn't try to rush me out nor were they cleaning and shutting down. Props!!!"}
{"text":"Cheesesteak, do it the right way, with cheese wiz, perfection. If you're a fan of sweet potato fries they have great ones.  Great lunch spot, order at the counter and sit, quick service."}
{"text":"Great cheesesteaks! Highly recommend, wish they would add condiments for you but that's the least of my worries here!"}
{"text":"Wife never had a philly so we looked over the valley for reviews and saw this one came highly rated. Got here right when it opened up on a Sunday. It's been busy since we got here which was a good sign. Bathrooms very clean also fyi. Ordered a large philly sweet peppers, cheese wiz and fries and drink, $17. Damn. Hmm just saying. Meat is soft, could have a little more flavor but hey their recipe. Cheese wiz nice and cheesy and salty. Grilled onions and peppers of course were good.  Overall all was good until my wife pulls out some hair from her sandwich  part way through. Debated whether to say something now or on our way out as to not make a scene nor to try and get free food which we don't want. Braved the rest of our sandwiches cautiously and yes they were fine, but sorry hair in the food kinda gave her a bad experience. Have no problem coming back and trying g a chicken philly next time. But folks need to watch the hair, hair nets or get some bald cooks."}
{"text":"I got the cheesesteak with onions, peppers, mushrooms and cheese whiz. It was just okay, not enough cheese and not enough seasoning. I also order the cheese fries which just had cheese whiz on them, I don't think I would pay the extra for the cheese but he fries and fry sauce were good. I liked the concept of the restaurant sourcing local but unfortunately wasn't the best cheesesteak around."}
{"text":"Utter deliciousness-every bite, every thing, every time.  I have been coming here for years and I am amazed at how good it is every time. Fresh home made rolls, high quality beef or chicken, quality cheeses make an amazing sandwich, and the fries, oh my goodness soooo good, especially the sweet Potato.  The fry sauce is a must but if you like ranch, ask  for some on the side, hause made and best on the planet.no joke-I would have it as my drink if I could afford the calories.  Employee turn over is low so they must take care of the staff,  and the owner is usually there, working just as hard as every one else.  Thanks for an amazing lunch."}
{"text":"This is our place to go for cheesesteaks. We get the large chicken with grilled onions and peppers, fry, drink, and add an extra drink. It's a lot of food and doesn't kill the wallet. We get the sandwich with fry sauce on it. Soo tasty. Always clean when we go in and the staff is friendly. My only complaint would be they need more locations!"}
{"text":"Forefathers is a pretty solid Cheesesteak Joint.  Everything is done fairly well; but, the thing I like best is adding Jalapeno Blue Cheese sauce to the Sandwich.  It just plain works and the spice is just right!  They also have fry sauce, which my sweets loves.  If your in the mood for a Cheesestea and your in the area, check them out."}
{"text":"Best Cheesesteak I have had. Their specialty Buffalo Chicken sandwich is even better. Try the awesome sweet potato fries. Super clean, super friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place. My favorite is the cheese whiz steak low carb style. I also like the cheese whiz fries. Can you tell I like cheese whiz...ha!"}
{"text":"Nah, I don't think so. They had all the makings to look like a legit cheesestake place - big slab grill, whiz on the menu, pics of Philly...but then the mirage wears off and you drink the sand.  The meat reminded me of grocery store freezer chipped beef, lackluster flavor on a too soft roll.  The only thing I appreciated was the whiz-to-beef ratio.  Also did not appreciate the Disney World resort type prices - holy moly!  I think I'll keep looking."}
{"text":"Meat was flavorless, cheese was cheap, and sandwich was soggy. Did not enjoy. Fries were good tho."}
{"text":"I was hanging out with my neighbors and were talking about Mikes Cheese Steaks closing and bumming out that our to go place was no longer open. My friend Kevin mentioned Forefathers as a solid place to get a great cheese steak. I was doing some business in Tempe and remembered him mentioning this place so I decided to stop in.  This place is in a strip mall and has a modern look about it, not sure what the Cow pictures have to do about our forefathers though. The cheesesteaks were awesome and offered all the choices of cheeses and buns were soft. I will be back unless we get a better place here in the Gilbert area."}
{"text":"Love this place! Simple menu and great food. Locally owned and well run. Busy for lunch, full of folks that appreciate a great meal. Try the complimentary fry sauce in the cooler by the fountain drinks."}
{"text":"Original wit Wiz and mushrooms... there is none better I've tried.  Better be hungry to devour a whole large one too, pretty big."}
{"text":"A co-worker told me about it and I was intrigued by the name. I love supporting small businesses and especially adore the businesses make their love and support for America well-known. The food was delicious and well priced. The atmosphere was very clean and inviting. The staff was friendly and helpful which is always a major plus! I had the chicken cheesesteak which in past experiences from other restaurants have been very dry, but not here. It was very flavorful and moist."}
{"text":"Just went to this place for the second time. I love it. I'm not from Philadelphia, but I know this is probably the best cheese steak I've ever had. Local business. The owner took my order, and was cleaning up trays when his crew was super busy with lunch rush. This guy's doing it right. Huge fan. Great food."}
{"text":"This is the best cheesesteak in the East Valley! The sandwiches are handsdown the best! The staff is friendly, the tables are always clean and the fry sauce is addictive! I swear you can put that stuff on an old tire and it would be edible."}
{"text":"We stopped at Forefathers for lunch this Saturday . This was our first visit, but we thought we give it a south Philly try coming from the Penna area. so yes I do know what a cheese steak should be.  It was good!  Not great ! The place was busy and people were even sitting outside in the heat.   Even though it  was packed the staff was friendly and efficient. The line moved pretty quick.  Our Original Phillys were messy and good.   Our negatives:  The size of the dining area. It was a bit small and crowded today.  The meat was per-cook it take away from the moisture and meat had a little burnt taste. You should make the sandwiches to order ... every order with fresh rib-eye meat \"not the pre cook\" stuff. keep the grill a little lower not burn the meat.  I will try this place again the future to see if anything changes.  The price for two cheese steak, 2-fries, 2 coke was $ 22.00 and change a little steep.  The combo did not include the drinks."}
{"text":"The fry sauce is the only reason I go here! The famous Philly cheesesteak is an added bonus tho. Overall I'd recommend Forefathers to anyone who loves sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Super delicious cheesesteaks.  The location is clean and tastefully decorated.  The bread was awesome.  Their fries are dynamite (malt vinegar and fry sauce are the way to my heart). We ordered a mini cheesesteak for our daughter and for free they upgraded her to a regular sized, great customer service.  We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Loved the food and thought the chocolate chip cookies was one of the best I've had (little crunchy but mostly chewy).     Great atmosphere, very clean.  Also loved the military display in the back.  Feels homey"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Seriously the best cheesesteak I've ever had. And the employees are always super nice and happy."}
{"text":"Awesome Philly cheesesteak sandwiches. Wit whiz. The cheese fries are awesome. Peppers are fresh, not canned. You can see the meat and peppers being prepared in front of you. Very clean. Staff is friendly and helpful. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had a cheese steak with wiz and sweet/regular potatoes. The cheese steak was flavorful, not dry and very filling. I like that they have more condiments out (sweet peppers, banana peppers, jalapeños) so you can customize your sandwich as you wish. The fries were so so good!!! I'm not a huge sweet potato fries fan but these were not dry or mushy, just right with the perfect amount of salt.  Ohhh, and I had a cookie! Big and soft and yummy!"}
{"text":"Literally my favorite place to eat at. And ironically, not for the cheesesteak, but for the buffalo chicken salad and fries!  I crave it and go 20 miles out of my way to go eat here! They are dog friendly and very friendly in general.  Wish there was one in central Phoenix so I could go more often!"}
{"text":"its a great philly cheese steak and the fires are great too, but its all about that fry sauce! and if you feel like spending $12-15 bucks on a lunch, so i go like once a year if even cause its way to much for lunch but it is so good. i guess with honeywell people nextdoor that can afford high priced lunches they should survive a while."}
{"text":"Had someone pick up the food for me.   Had a steak with wiz and jalapeño and mushrooms and a side of fries The cheesesteak was pretty legit!  Spicy jalapeño and really good mixture of the meat and cheese The fries were deliciously salty.  I will  order here again for sure! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I've been searching for a good Philly cheesesteak.  This is probably the best one that I have found yet.  I would recommend this place. A little pricey."}
{"text":"Really great steak and fries. Little on the pricy side, but the food is awesome.  Got mine with wiz and fries. Big sandwich and full of flavor. Malt vinegar on the fries was a nice touch. The cilantro ranch was a great dipping sauce. Overall, a really great place and tasty sandwich."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch...I was massively impressed with the overall cleanliness and friendliness of the place. I feel that sometimes you don't really find that here in the Valley.  I ordered a cheesesteak with onions and mushrooms. I also got a side of fries and my friend got a chicken cheesesteak...  I really wanted to like this place because of the positive reviews. I had such a wonderful experience there, but my cheesesteak was so bland -- almost like they forgot to put salt and pepper on it.  My friend's chicken cheesesteak was, according to her, \"a huge salt lick\". I think I'd rather have taken the salt lick over the non salty food I had. Even the mushrooms and onions lacked flavor...and the swiss cheese was bland as well.  I'm going to give this place another shot...but for now it's just ok. The fries made me happy enough to give them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwich! Cheese sauce on the philly is a must. A little pricy, but worth it. Please open one in tempe marketplace!"}
{"text":"Philadelphia is pretty far to go for the \"real thing,\" but I have been blown away twice at how close they come to replicating a great Philly Cheesteak! They do a fabulous job!  Oh sure, the roll isn't nearly as good as Delassandro's (my favorite in Philly') and it probably doesn't measure up to this year's winner (Johnny's Hots) in Philadelphia Magazine, but these people are doing a great job with what they have. They even offer one so large, I believe it comes with wheels, so you can drive it home.  Great taste and you can have Cheese Whiz on it to make it even more authentic. Plus look at ALL you will have saved in airfare!  If the rolls were better I would have opted for FIVE STARS, but these rolls will suffice to make it a terrific experience."}
{"text":"Being from Philly, I have made it a point to try every \"authentic\" Philly cheesesteak place I've come across since moving to AZ in 1982.  Since Longhitano's in Tempe closed close to a decade ago, every new place has fallen so short it's sad, really.  Not enough meat, rolls all wrong, meat TASTES wrong ...   Then my friend Brian, also a Philly native, came to town from L.A.  I decided we needed to try Forefathers.  We went ... we ate ... we ascended to a level of bliss not known in forever.  THESE are AUTHENTIC Philly cheesesteaks.  Don't have to pay for double meat, you can actually get a \"wit wiz\" ... AND a pizza cheesesteak.  OMG, sheer delight!  Brian had the cheese fries as well and they were so yum.  And the staff behind the counter were just AWESOME.  When we went to thank them for the amazing meal, they all cheered that they passed muster with us.  Honestly, anyone who did not grow up partaking of the wonders of real Philly cheesesteaks just cannot appreciate the awesomeness of Forefathers.  We liked it so much we are going back again on Sunday before Bri goes back to L.A.  He posted on his facebook page, and I quote \"Who'd have thunk that Phoenix would have the most authentic cheesesteak I've had since leaving Philly?\"  My ONLY beef (no pun intended) with Forefathers is that they have Hunts ketchup (which tastes awful IMHO) instead of Heinz.  Yes I know, some people consider ketchup on a cheesesteak sacreligious but that's how I grew up.  Sunday I'll try a pizza cheesesteak so it won't matter ;)  Oh, and try the homemade chocolate chip cookies ... oh sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Great food, fair price. The cheesteak was great as were the fries. This isn't a place to go for a cheap meal, my combo of a large philly, fries, and drink was 16 dollars. I will return to try another delicious meal."}
{"text":"I checked Yelp and saw all the stars!!  I need to try this place and it was by Ikea.  Plus!!  I got the chicken & my hubby got the steak.  The place smells delicious.  I got the cheese fries.  They have a simple menu, I like it!    Ordered and I was expecting greatness.  I was so bummer to taste chicken and cheese.  No flavor (salt and/or black pepper)?  My hubby's steak was tasteless too.  The fries were good, but eat the cheese quick.  When it get cold, it does not taste good."}
{"text":"Took my son here while in the area for a baseball tournament last weekend.  I've never been to Philly so don't know what the cheesesteaks there are like but loved this place!  We definitely would plan on going back."}
{"text":"Drove all the way from Maricopa to get one. So good, steak is tender and they pack it on. The fries are also amazing. Luv this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Very very good.  Cheese steak was just like Jim's on south street.  From what I remember. But nonetheless it was awesome. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"All I can say is this... Fry sauce....on a cheese steak. Does not get any better than that!  I was sold as soon as I saw those magic words in the reviews.  Went there for lunch on a gorgeous Saturday afternoon, line was short and service was quick!  The place was clean and smelled just amazing.  It's hard to find a good cheese steak restaurant around here and I am so thankful to have found them!  I ordered a regular steak with cheese wiz and fry sauce.  I didn't know I needed fry sauce on a cheese steak until now. Their french fries were tasty and salted just right!  Everything was cooked perfectly.  I highly recommend this place. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Just ate this and I'm already craving another...They really do have the \"Best Steaks in Town\" but also the best french fries! I'm not kidding. Best fries I have ever had. I was going to just snag a couple of my mom's, but after trying one I went and ordered a whole tray of them for myself. There's also a  whole refrigerator stocked full of complimentary specialty peppers and famous fry sauce. Most definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"OOOMMMGGG...I am obsessed with Forefathers.  I think I could literally eat there every day.  They do have a bunch of sandwich options, although I've stuck with the Original \"with wiz\".  They have a small fridge with peppers and fry sauce--must try the fry sauce.  The staff there is so nice and it's always clean.  The only bad thing about going during lunch is that it is on the small side so seating can sometimes be a problem.  They do have outdoor seating though."}
{"text":"I must say I'm extremely impressed! I called 1 min before they closed and the young man that answered was still more then happy to take my order. The customer service here is a rare thing these days. I would come back just because of it! The environment was clean and the food was fresh despite me ordering 1 min before closing! I got some fry sauce to try cause the reviews rave about it, it's a must try that's for sure! I had an awesome experience! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The Best Cheesesteak there is.  We've been to Philly and tried Pat's, Geno's, Steve's Prince of Steaks and Cheesesteaks at the Reading Terminal Market.  Forefather's beats them all."}
{"text":"This place is freaking delicious. I don't typically like cheesesteaks, because at most places, it's like a pile of greasy plastic and leather."}
{"text":"This place is all around delicious! I've had this spot bookmarked for a while and we finally checked it out. The cheesesteaks are great and the fries were surprisingly amazing!! I got my steak with sweet peppers, onions, mushrooms and the jalapeño ranch sauce is legit! We left satisfied and will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best cheesesteaks in the Valley, look no further! The meat they use doesn't have any fat, and is super flavorful! The service is fast, and fries are fresh and crispy every time! It feels a little cramped in space when the building is full, but I love that they have outdoor seating. I see everyone raving about their fry sauce, but I personally think the cilantro ranch is to DIE for!!! Quality 5/5 Service 5/5 Happy Tummy 1/1"}
{"text":"Not busy at all today. Able to get in and out. Great service with some good recommendations!   This spot was recommended by a friend for lunch who said they had the best cheesesteak sandwitches in town. I have to say that I was I'm pressed and even more impressed with the sweet potato fries. The great thing I liked about customizing the sandwitches was that I was able to add bacon to the delightful treat!! You can never go wrong when bacon is involved!! Great option for lunch!"}
{"text":"I think this place is great. I love the cheesteaks and their sweet potato fries. I tried their homemade chili once and it was good, but I found it to be a bit soupy.  The staff is always friendly and the dining area is nice and clean."}
{"text":"Fantastic #lowcarb / #keto option with their salads. Their steak salad is basically a cheesesteak with your choice of cheese and grilled shrooms / peppers / onions on a beautiful mix of fresh kale / mixed greens and romaine, broccoli, purple cabbage and cherry tomatoes. Get the jalapeño cilantro ranch and some free sides of pickled jalapeños / cherry peppers to kick it up a notch.  Very good and very fresh."}
{"text":"I am not happy with the co worker who introduced me to Forefathers.  Do I really need another way to feed my addiction to cheesy, beefy goodness?    Of course I do!  This small restaurant in a Tempe strip mall has earned a special place in my heart.  No, not just because of the artery-strengthening cheese.  It is home to the best cheesesteak I have experienced since moving to AZ.  While the menu offers a variety of choices other than cheesesteak sandwiches (chicken and even *gasp!* salads), I stick with what I know and love:  Regular with Cheez Wiz ($7.35) - bring your appetite, because this sandwich is big!  A generous portion of thinly sliced meat and that oh so important Cheez Wiz is nestled within a soft bun.  It is gooey, drippy and messy.  Perfect.  If Wiz is not for you, it is also offered with white American cheese, Provolone or Mozzarella.  While I prefer mine with just the basic meat and cheese, you healthy types can also get any combination of 'OMG' - onions, mushrooms and green peppers.  Fries are a very nice compliment to the sandwich.  Let's be honest here, fries are a very nice compliment to nearly anything.  Forefathers' fries ($2.55) are hot, salty and crisp.  If you haven't gotten your fill of Wiz on your sandwich, you can turn those fries into Cheese Fries ($2.95).  Either way, be sure to grab a container of 'fry sauce' (I am guessing this is some blend of ketchup and mayo).  One taste and you will want to put this on everything.    Lucky for me and my cholesterol level, this gem is nowhere near where I live."}
{"text":"Freaking love their cheesesteaks... Yum yum yum. Prices are a bit high, but worth it especially when you're in the mood!!"}
{"text":"Good food, fast, friendly service. Cute little place with seating indoors and on a little patio out front. Clean too :-)  Likely will go back and try other options. I had the chicken with buffalo sauce, white cheddar and all the veggies. Was really good and the price was good too."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday 10/13/2016 during the peak lunch hour. The service was fast and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Pretty good cheesesteak. We go there often.  Make sure to get an order of sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"These guys know how to deliver, best and only place to get a real cheesesteak! Roll holds the gooey wiz and tender beef"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. Really great cheesesteaks and fries. Get lots of fry sauce if you go there. So glad I stopped by!"}
{"text":"Simple menu, amazing results! Their philly cheese steak was amazing with their sauce. It went well with the sweet potato fries. I had the chicken sandwich with the cheese wiz another time and I absolutely loved it. I need to go back!"}
{"text":"I like big portions and I left satisfied with a regular cheesesteak. They had to option to include fry sauce on the cheesesteak, which of course I requested. Overall, very delicious. The fries were pretty good, albeti standard fare. The only real negative I have to say is that it's a bit too pricey to go here often. It was almost 30 dollars for a meal for two, but hey it's a giant heap of steak so I can understand the price point."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after a day of shopping. So yummy. Loved the cheesesteak and fry sauce. Must get the cookie, it was amazing!!!  To bad we don't have one in Vegas. This would be one of our regulars."}
{"text":"I had to come back. This is the second time I'm eating here in a week. Best cheesesteaks I've ever had! The white American is delicious and even the \"cheese wiz\", which freaked me out at first, is awesome. The fries have right about of crisp to them and come out hot. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband is from Philadelphia and this is the only place that he'll eat a Philly Cheesesteak. Amazing fries, fresh bread, and the closest thing to back home that he's found. Plus, their salads are amazing. The service is consistent and perfect every time."}
{"text":"Only place to go for an authentic cheesesteak in AZ. The meat is always grilled to perfection and anyone who knows anything knows the cheese whiz is where it's at when it comes to the philly chee. Then there's the fry sauce and unlimited hot and sweet peppers selection. My only question is, why haven't they expanded to the rest of the Valley?"}
{"text":"The food is ALWAYS DELICIOUS!! The service is top notch, VERY friendly and you never wait an excessive amount of time for your order, no matter how slammed they are! This clearly demonstrates that the owner truly values his customers and strives for excellence and repeat business, ALWAYS impressed!! But today i was VERY impressed at the patience and professionalism the staff (might I add very young staff) demonstrated!! There was a large group (20+) of adults and young children. While the parents socialized and allowed their children to treat the entire establishment like a McPlayPlace (jumping and running along the benches, rolling a skate board on the floor, yelling, screaming, etc.) the staff remained incredibly professional and did not let any frustrations hinder the world class service and cleanliness!! They dodged children to make sure their soda machine was spotless, the condiment fridge was full, their paper towel rolls were loaded! I was SO impressed! I was frustrated with the lack of parenting and blatant disrespect for property and other people that was displayed, but,  the staff blew me away with their good attitudes! This truly speaks volumes of these individuals!!!"}
{"text":"Soooooooooo good.   Do the cheez whiz!  Omg authentic.  We travel an hour for this stuff!!!"}
{"text":"This place got such good reviews from people purportedly from Philly that I was excited to check it out.  If you are really from Philly, you will find this place disappointing.  The meat is pre-cooked. The rolls bear no resemblence whatsoever to an Amoroso roll. The fries are battered. When I requested cheese fries (with melted mozzarella--something you can get in any pizza parlor in Philly) they were happy to make it for me (as pizza fries are on the menu) but it was battered fries with a SLICE of mozzarella melted on top. The cheese was lucky that it coated 10 fries. There are better places in Phoenix to get a passable cheesesteak (there is one place who's name I cannot recall, that actually flies in Amoroso rolls, tastykakes and Goldenburgs Peanut Chews--that sort of effort is to be commended.)  If you are looking for a good cheesesteak you will do better at any Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"Is it true that I haven't reviewed Forefathers yet? I am in serious disbelief. Forefathers is like my favorite thing ever ever ever. For starters, the service is so wonderful here. It is family owned, so it definitely has a warm, inviting feel to it. You can watch them cook your sandwich right by the register, and it seems they are always talking with each other, laughing, and having a great time. From pure speculation, I feel like the family that owns it really enjoy each others' company. But I digress.  Their cheesesteak sandwiches are amazing. Melt in your mouth, packed with flavor, fresh and hot off the grill amazing. The words escape me for how unbelievably delicious their sandwiches are. They are messy in the best kind of way - I don't even care how silly I look with greasy flavor dripping off of my elbow. Ten stars for the sandwiches. Fifteen stars for the sandwiches. A million stars for the sandwiches!  The decor is also really great here. Lots of patriotism up in that joint. But seriously, try these guys out. I promise you it will be one of the best sandwiches you'll ever eat."}
{"text":"My recommendation: pizza cheesesteak with mozzarella. Oh man, too delicious. (it's pizza sauce added to a traditional cheesesteak sandwich). The staff there are always super friendly and will chat about their cheesesteaks as long as you let them :)   It's a small place- maybe 15-18 tables- where you order at the counter and they call your number when the order is ready."}
{"text":"Can I give this place 10 stars, somehow?  My GOODNESS.  This place was worth waiting for and AMAZING doesn't even properly sum up the deliciousness served up at Forefathers.    The ambiance is cute and very patriotic...very welcoming.  The young, male dominated staff was also very nice and seemed happy to answer any questions.    The restaurant was clean as were the restrooms and everything was well stocked.  They have a nice outdoor patio area where you can eat as well and they provide a red condiment cart for things you may need if eating outdoors...very nice touch!   My husband and I are BIG eaters, no doubt about it, and we were shocked at the huge portions and even more shocked that neither one of us could finish our food. That is a RARITY!   We each order a large cheesesteak combo and our total came to $35.98 with two soft drinks included.  Check out the photos for more detail about the food.    Forefathers is an absolute GEM.  We aim to come back every time we visit the Tempe area. If you are lucky enough to LIVE here, check them out of you like cheesesteak sandwiches.  You will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have visited this place 2 times with my husband.  I'll be honest, I've never had a \"cheesesteak\" before, so my review is based off of Forefathers and not a comparison of a philly cheesesteak.  By the way, they don't claim to be a Philly Cheesesteak, just a Cheesesteak.  Maybe it doesn't matter.  Whatever.  The first time I had a regular size with Cheez Whiz, no peppers and onions.  In my experience you get big long strips of peppers and onions, so I passed.  I also heard a real cheesesteak has cheez whiz on it, not provolone, so I opted for the Cheez Whiz.  I also got an order of fries.  Let me say, you get a TON of fries and the regular size Cheesesteak is almost as big as a footlong.  This sandwich was YUMMY!!!  The fries were really good, and you have unlimited fry sauce.  I think the fry sauce was good, but a tad bit bland.  So i used ketchup as well.  My hubby got the regualar size Cheesesteak with provolone, peppers and mushrooms.  I saw that the peppers were small and diced up!  He love his meal.  The second time I got the regular sandwich, cheez whiz and peppers, he got the large sandwich with provolone, peppers and mushrooms.  We split and order of fries this time.  His sandwich was too big, and usually he can really pack food in, so this goes to show how big the sandwich is.  Again, we loved it!  ****Warning****** the food is a bit on the satly side, so order a large drink and bring some Diurex with  you!  Your calves will look like tree trunks if you don't!  We will eat here again for sure.  I wish they were open a bit later though, they close at 8pm.  :-("}
{"text":"This place is just OK for me.  I live nearby, so I'll have it every once in a while (~4-5 mos) when I'm tired of all the standard fast food / quick dine fare.  However, I always have higher hopes for this place, especially with the words \"gourmet cheesesteaks\" in their name.  Alas, I'm always somewhat disappointed.  While the food is always edible, it just never seems to live up to their name, or these other high star reviews.  The bread is always a bit soggy so there's that.  I'm also apparently an odd bird, as I enjoy lettuce and tomato on my cheesesteaks.  Lettuce nearly non-existent and tomatoes are sparse, but to be fair, this is typical of any cheesesteak joint when I order those toppings.  A better cheesesteak, IMO, is Corleone's at 16th St / Camelback (not sure if they have other locations), but I no longer live in that area.  So, to conclude, Forefathers is just OK, nothing special, but could possibly satisfy your cheesesteak craving, depending on how particular you are.  If you enjoy sloppy, messy, wet cheesesteaks (and I know some people do!) then this is your place."}
{"text":"Goood cheesesteaks! I went and picked up and it was delicious!! Best I've had so far. Picking up allowed the juices to marinate with the bread and was still hot when I got home."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch. Amazing as always.  I probably should consider healthier options but it's just amazing. The meat is fresh, the bread is fresh, ordering is simple and straightforward. They have an excellent choice of toppings. I also think the fries may even be hand-cut and prepared on site. Keyword: maybe, as I never asked. Regardless, compared to the Philly cheesesteak sandwich in well... Philadelphia (I'm thinking of Geno's, Pat's, Luke's, etc) Forefathers makes the best I've had in Arizona. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  My buddy and I found this place one night when driving around looking for places to eat.  I'm not really in to cheesesteaks, but this place is full of awesome.  I've never tried it, but you can also get an authentic (so I'm told) cheesesteak with \"wiz\" on it - no, no one is peeing on it...it's Cheese Wiz... LOL  The place gets a little loud because it's all tile flooring, but the cheesesteaks are better than any other cheesesteak place I've been to in the valley."}
{"text":"Excellent flavor with wiz and came hot like lava. Being picky I like my roll a little crusty. These were soft. Great ambience and clean. Condiments we're on point. Highlight was the fries!!! If comparing probably not getting a return from me but enjoyed the visit. Price was a little high."}
{"text":"Forefathers is great! I went there yesterday and was greeted at the register by the owner who chatted me up for a few minutes and suggested fry dipping combos for me to try, I can't say enough about the staff, great people.    Yesterday I had the original and a side of sweet potato fries. The original is a 9 inch (I think) roll with sliced rib-eye, grilled onions, and cheese whiz... holy cow, it was delicious. The meat was tender, not stringy or chewy and had enough flavor to make it through both the cheese and the onions, which were just wonderful icing on the cake. The roll was firm enough to hold up to all the juices, yet was soft and tasted very fresh. The sweet potato fries also blew me away, they were not overly fried by any means, just enough to be hot and steaming and were wonderfully sweet. The owner convinced me to take a side of honey mustard to dip them in, and it was a terrific choice. The dressing added a little sweetness, but the mustard added just enough tang to produce a delightful symphony between the two. Yum.    I strongly recommend Forefathers, I have been several times and it is so good each time. The decorations are interesting, the food is delicious and the staff is attentive and extremely friendly and helpful. Go. You'll thank me."}
{"text":"A couple weeks ago a friend had told me I'd never had a real cheese steak unless I'd had one with Cheese Whiz. Turns out the Cheese Whiz used on cheese steaks isn't the same kind college students stack with Ritz crackers to give themselves early heart attacks.   I had the #1 (Steak and Cheese Whiz) and it was delicious. I got fries and a drink as well and my total came out to ~$10. The portions are quite large and they give you a hefty serving of meat in the sandwich.   Be careful when eating because these sandwiches are literally dripping with cheese. The bun was great and somehow didn't get soggy.   I've been to a few places serving cheese steaks in the valley and this is the best, added bonus is you can be in and out of here in five minutes."}
{"text":"I have had both Pat's and Geno's in Philadelphia , theses are WAY better than both.  The hoogie buns are soft and fantastic. The meat has just enough fat to make it melt cheese wiz goodness everywhere!!  In heaven!  In heaven!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Best cheese steaks in AZ and the fries are amazing. Order comes out quick hardly have to wait make sure to ADD cheese and their sauces are awaome. Just a great friendly and clean environment..... Must try"}
{"text":"I have never been to Philadelphia and I have never tried a cheesesteak there but I have been to fore fathers and can tell you that this place is amazing.   I always get the regular cheesesteak with wiz and onions plus some fries, you will love them both. The only thing I wish they still did was make their amazing cookies, even if it was just a once a month thing."}
{"text":"Forefathers is definitely our new regular treat. From \"one nation under God\" at the door, to the \"Ultimate Sacrifice\" wall, everything about this neighborhood spot represents the awesomeness of America. The awesomeness of opportunity, capital and making a kick ass cheesesteak thats better than any other west of the Mississippi River."}
{"text":"Ordered a regular but the guy ordered me the large one, that didn't set well with me first off. Then ordered with cheese barely knew it had cheese on it. Asked for vegetables on it - I like onions Ann bell peppers and mushrooms work. Just have had better!"}
{"text":"I'd like to begin by saying that I am not a cheesesteak lover or aficionado..but I find myself thinking about these cheesesteaks everyday. It is by far the best cheesesteak in Arizona (according to my boyfriend who has tried them all) and is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. I wish I didn't live in North Phoenix because I would eat here everyday if I could. You have to try it and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The staff is really friendly and today I got a free drink with my order. I went to have lunch with a coworker and really wasn't that hungry. I only ordered fries (which are delicious) and the guy was nice enough to give me a drink. Some places will charge you for a glass of water! My coworker raved about his cheesesteak and I have always been a fan of their Buffalo chicken. The portions are large, so they really fill you up. They have a pretty good fry sauce too! This place is really close to where I work so that's a huge plus. Highly recommend this place if you're in the area. Don't leave without trying their cookies!! They're to die for!"}
{"text":"First time here. Great service and great food.  The cheesesteaks are really good. I had one with cheese wiz and my wife with american cheese. Ordered a side of fries and got a free large drink! They have fresh peppers in a mini fridge by the drinks fo free! The wife and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This cheesesteak is part of my ton three that I've tried. I always want to go back for seconds but I get too full from the loaded sandwiches. The cheese wiz/steak ratio is deliciously melted when you get it, just perfect. They have their own sauce on the side along with a variety of peppers you can add in. I have yet to try them since I stick to the original one. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Yelp brought me here. Your reviews were spot on! Such a cool little atmosphere and a cheesesteak you can't find elsewhere in the Valley. Definitely take advantage of the \"Fry Sauce!\" Even good on the sandwich! Will definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Very good cheesesteaks! They cool it fresh right in front of you and it's ready to eat very quickly. They have a simple menu and that tells me their very confident in the food they serve, and rightfully so!! Strongly recommend eating here when in the area!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place, best cheese steaks in town. Always clean and the employees are super nice!!"}
{"text":"I must admit when they first opened I was not impressed with this place at all... But I always give a second chance to a restaurant and I am glad I did. I always order a #1 Philly Original - (Served with grilled onions and cheese whiz \"wiz\" and an order of sweet potato fries. The cheese steak is good but I have to say the best part would be the sweet potato fries. Make sure to get all the extra condiment from the little refrigerator on the way out the fry sauce is a must for dipping."}
{"text":"Delicious and fast, which I appreciate very much when we are on a time crunch! We both got the cheesesteaks one with cheese wiz and the other with provolone and of course with all the fixings! It's a lot of food so I suggest the mini sub for sure if your not a big eater! Don't waste anytime go try this place now!"}
{"text":"Clean enjoyable restaurant with speedy service.  My cheesesteak was delicious!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place's portions are great for cheese steaks , and so far in Phx for the dollar amount probably the best dollar pre steak ratio. The meat is cooked well , the bread is not over fully and they have the wiz option which if you are from back east is a must. The staff seem quite friendly and the place is clean and spacious . I should of taken a picture because once again , they do not slack on the meat. This would be my favorite spot but Frank's down in Tucson just has number one az cheese steak hands down . I spent about 16 bucks for cheese steak (they include mushroom bonus points) and cheesy fries (not a ton fries but come on the steaks are big enough meal). They threw in free drink so bonus points again.   I would recommend stopping by the staff may be a bunch of kids but the steaks are all grown."}
{"text":"Ahhh almost forgot bout this place. We went there for lunch from work when it first opened up. My friend could not shut it about Philly steak and CheezeWiz (Or whatever its called.)  So, they dragged me in there. I could not bring myself to order fat dripping and CheezeWiz smothered real Cheese Steak so i ordered chicken one instead. It was BORING, dry and uninteresting. My granny (One from mom's side who can not cook) could make it way better.  So, while i honestly can not evaluate their main product - Cheese Steak,  whatever i got kinda suxed!  They do draw big crowds now and sometime there is no place to seat, or at least that is what guys from work telling me. But whataver...  \"I no like\""}
{"text":"This was hands down the best cheesesteak place I've been to. We walked in as first timers and were greeted by Laurie. We told her we have never been in before and she gave us a whole run down of the menu and what she recommended - all with a very welcoming attitude.  Upon receiving our order, we noticed her as well as the other young gentlemen make sure the place was clean, and they even stopped two times to ask how we liked our meal.  Which was delicious may I add.  Highly recommend coming here for quick, friendly and delicious bite to eat."}
{"text":"I've been here about three times now. I'd have to say they consistently serve the best Philly cheesesteak, fries and fry sauce I've ever had. The foods hot and fresh. Oh and if you're a cookie lover make sure to grab your favorite one before you leave for dessert.   The prices aren't to high I'd say about average for the amount of food you get. The wait especially during the lunch and dinner hour is a little long but definitely worth it. For the amount of people that come here to eat during peak hours you'd think they'd had enough space to sit and enjoy your meal but that's not the case here. If you have time to wait for a seat then really it's no biggie but if it is call ahead to pick your food up and head out.   The employees are very friendly and considering how crazy busy this place gets its pretty clean.  Overall, definitely a must try"}
{"text":"YUM, YUM, YUM!!!! If you have never been here you should definitely try it out! Quick service and great salads and cheesesteaks!"}
{"text":"Got the large steak sandwich with provolone, onions, mushrooms, sweet peppers and fry sauce, and a side of sweet potato fries. Came with a free drink. The fries were a little bit expensive but the large sandwich is way more than enough food and we'll worth $12. The bread was soft and spongey, i loved it. The fry sauce was undetectable on the sandwich but I didn't mind seeing as they have a fridge full of free fry sauce next to the drinks. I'm interested in trying the chicken with buffalo and spicy blue cheese. Also the steak with wiz. I have a feeling that this will be all I'm eating for about a week."}
{"text":"The other day I stopped at the Family Friday food truck event in Peoria on m way home from work, and OMG I'm so glad I did.,everything looked yummy, but what made forefathers stick out more was the smiling man working the counter, and the smell oh my goodness the smell of the cheesecakes was amazing. I love a good smile and someone willing to help. After talking a few minutes I chose my cheesesteak. Let me tell you although it looked basic it was the best tasting cheesesteak I've ever had. The bun was slightly toasted and didn't get soggy which is a big deal to me. The onions didn't over power it either . Perfect. My only wish is that they'd make a permanent location in the west valley so we could enjoy these more often."}
{"text":"First, I'd like to say the rating is based on the food. Before I get into that, let me address the noise level. This is probably one of the noisiest restaurants I've been in. There were less than 20 people at any given time while I was there and the noise level was absolutely awful. I could barely hear the guy taking our order, and I have (what my husband refers to as) dog-like hearing.  (there is an outside seating area) The cheese steak subs are uber good!!! Get the Whiz on yours, because that makes it authentic AND it tastes better (we've now been two times and the hubs tried provolone this time and 'meh). We've tried both the steak and cheese options, both are terrific. Their fries are pretty good, too!"}
{"text":"Napkins required! I dare you to eat a wonderfully gooey cheesesteak here without making a mess.   They do a great job on their food. The roll is springy and fresh. The steak has great flavor, texture, and a thickness. You have a lot of cheese options, but they have the classic cheese wiz. We're talking old school style cheese wiz. A real treat, but if you're a bit faint of heart on cheese wiz, their other options won't disappoint. Grilled onions are good and retain a nice texture. A HUGE plus in my book is being able to add regular ol' sautéed bell peppers, instead of the sweet pickeled ones (they have those too, I just can't get past the taste of them no matter where I am). For a little heat, you can add cherry peppers or jalapeños. I went for cherry peppers and it was awesome. The even better part that has to be mentioned is this is a cheesy cheesesteak. I like mine cheesy and without fail I have to order extra cheese, well until I came here. Their regular sandwhich, without extras, satisfies my cheesy needs and then some. Of course, should I ever want to experience cheese nirvana, they offer an option for extra cheese. One of these days, I'll order extra cheese, simply because I can, but right now the idea of extra cheese here is slightly intimidating in the best possible way.   Fries are fries, but their's are good. What makes them special is the dipping sauce they have. Reminds me of what mom called \"russian dressing\" and put on hamburgers when I was a kid. I still make it to this day.  I'm not going to ruin the recipe for them, but it's a mayo and tomato based sauce that you mustn't pass up. It's almost a mexi-ranch without the ranch flavor.   Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable enough to make solid recommendations, if you want to have a sandwhich that is far better than an average cheesesteak. Service is quick, but there was nobody ahead of me when I went. Prior trips have felt similarly fast though with consistently good quality service.   In a valley of mediocre cheesesteak shops, Forefathers is a cut above the rest."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in South Philly and this is the best Cheesesteak I have found so far in the 13 Years i have been here in AZ."}
{"text":"Hungry feed your belly with some wiz on your cheese steak always good..  Try it once youll tell your friends its so good."}
{"text":"Philly with cheese wiz onions and bell peppers! BOMB.COM... Nothing more to say! I will gladly gain 30 pounds in a month eating this daily"}
{"text":"Lots of people make long reviews for some fast food joint,  im going to make mine short. My friend wanted to go here, so I thought I'd give it a try since I love cheeses teams. I've had the real thing in Philly, but you could never hold a candle to the best. Honestly, I don't know what the hype is all about. It's not that great to me. They use Kraft cheese whiz, which I could have bought at the grocery store. Meat didn't have much flavor. I felt like I got railed on the price, $30 for two sandwich combos, Cmon. Easy to miss unless you know where it is. Forgettable experience and was more upset when I left then what I came in due to the high expectations of other yelp reviews."}
{"text":"3-3.5 stars... Needed to grab lunch and looked to Yelp to direct me while traveling.  Reviews looked good for Forefathers so we tried it out.  When we arrived the place was packed...which was a good sign.  Service was fast and friendly with everything cooked to order in front of you.    Overall the Philly was good (steak, w/ provolone and hot sauce), as were the fries along with their 'fry sauce'.  It wasn't the best Philly I have ever had, but would be worth stopping in again for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Stop by for a quick lunch .. I saw a lot of good reviews on this place so I decided to try . I got a regular with provolone, onions , peppers and jalapeños and added fry sauce . When I said excellent , EXCELLENT  . It's really hard to find food in Arizona that's actually really great . I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Four days and maybe seven hours ago, our hunger brought us forth to eat cheesesteak, to try a new restaurant, conceived in Philly, but dedicated to the proposition that not all cheesesteaks are created equal.  We shared a large chicken cheesesteak with everything (onions, bell peppers), and cheese wiz, along with some sweet potato fries.  The chicken cheesesteak came with a good amount of tender chicken, with a lot of flavor.  There is a free-range mini fridge that is stocked with sweet , hot peppers, and fry sauce which is nice so you can customize your order with as many or as little peppers as you want.  While the ingredients were good quality, the cheesesteak as a whole naturally doesn't really compare to any I've had in Philly, but it's good for Arizona!  The sweet potato fries were my favorite part of the meal.  They were excellently cooked with just the right amount of crunch while still tender and sweet inside.  So would our forefathers be impressed by Forefathers?  They probably wouldn't know what a cheesesteak would be, but if they tasted one, I would say they would be!"}
{"text":"Forefathers is great. It's the best cheesesteak I've had in Arizona so far. I haven't tried many but best so far. The small sized one should be filling enough for most people. The fries are very tasty. It was a reasonable price for such a high quality. The staff was friendly and quick making the food. The restaurant was clean"}
{"text":"I was informed they've been in business at the same location 17 yrs now. You don't stay open that long unless it's delicious, which it is!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now, and the cheesesteaks are absolutely amazing, but I don't care for their french fries and they blew it on the fry sauce (I am originally from the birthplace of fry sauce, so I know my fry sauce). The fries and sauce are what is keeping them from earning 4 or 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. Every time we go here it's great and it never fails. The cheesesteak is great but so is the chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce, celery and ranch. I also recommend the buffalo chicken salad with the jalapeño cilantro ranch dressing! It is delicious and def has a kick to it! Wonderful customer service as well."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Delicious cheesesteaks, by far the best in the valley. Juicy and delicious. From the moment you walk in you are greeted and it feels like home - even so far as to yell your name out once they know you. I love Forefathers and recommend it to any and all!"}
{"text":"Best Cheesesteak in AZ.  Been to Forefathers a lot and it never lets me down.  The service is good and the food is great."}
{"text":"Wow!  Who could imagine an awesome,  genuinely prepared cheesesteak in tempe AZ.  Menu item #1, cheese 'wit'.  My kids and.wife loved it as well.  To top it all off,  one if the best bread puddings I ever had."}
{"text":"Ahh cheesesteaks, what a sensitive topic. Well I feel that before I start I have to state that I AM a Philly native. I'm not saying my review/opinion holds more weight than that of others, but basically, it does.   Forefather's is good to go in my book! I tried their \"the original\" and it did bring a slight smile to my face when I bit into it. The shredded style of steak isn't my choice (see my Steve's Prince of Steaks review) but other than that, they've got it down OK. I won't ding them on their not using a certain kind of roll made from Philly local bakery Amoroso's as I don't believe that is a possibility out here.   The only thing that I can say that is a negative about the place is that they are pretty pricey for the amount that you get. However, I too will accept this as things like this are pretty much a novelty here, and I guess I'll have to pay a little bit more for less to remind myself of home in between visits back east.  The fries were OK, and I didn't get to use any of their fry sauce so I can't comment on that.   +1 for the patriotic decor, and another +1 for their tribute to the \"forefather's of cheesesteaks\" display, even though I believe that the big two have become tourist traps and aren't really that great anymore (see SPoS review). Jim's is in the NE very close to Steve's. You \"could\" say that Jim's is Steve's biggest rival, except that Steve's is without peers."}
{"text":"Forefathers is AWESOME!  Not sure that much more needs to be said.  The food is great, but what really makes me smile about Forefathers is that we've always had a positive service experience and we've been here lots and lots of times!  The other positive is that the restaurant is always clean!  The tables are cleared and wiped down pretty much as soon as someone leaves.  The fountain drink station remains clean, the napkins are stocked, etc.  Consistency is what makes this a place worth frequenting!  So I will end where I started.  Forefathers is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I'm impressed by Forefathers because the cheesesteaks here are almost as good as the ones I make!  3.5 stars, rounded up because Ben Franklin is a rebel, indeed.  Here's my game plan when I come to this joint:  1. Large cheesesteak with OMG (onions, mushroom, green pepper) and provolone 2. Added pizza sauce and cheese whiz 3. Small order of french fries 4. Grabbed sweet peppers and cherry peppers from the fridge 5. Combined everything together 6. Thought to myself, \"I am amazing.\"  All that for under $13.  Not bad!  The steak was juicy and tender, the veggies and cheese were of excellent quality, the pizza sauce took it up a notch, and the cheese whiz sealed the deal - like frosting on a cake!  I also really enjoy how they have the sweet peppers, cherry peppers, jalapenos, and fry sauce in little to-go containers.  When I'm not in a steaky mood, I opt for the chicken + mozzarella + buffalo sauce, can I get a \"hell yessss\"?  Bottom line: come out here and make the founding fathers proud that our country can celebrate unapologetic gluttony/awesomeness."}
{"text":"My partner and I (who are cheesesteak fanatics and have tried every place in tempe) have come to the unanimous decision that this is the best cheesesteak place in the tempe/phx area. And they have mini portions perfect for those with small appetites like me! We go at least once a week"}
{"text":"Good steak sandwich, steak was thin and no fat. The only downside was the bread was a little soggy, would be perfect if the bun was toasted. The tomato Parmesan vinaigrette dressing for my salad was excellent, lettuce was fresh!"}
{"text":"Omg so yummy! Best in Arizona! Fast friendly serves and amazing food. My husband eats out everyday for lunch and he found this jewel and shared it with me. Never in my life did you think I could get cheesesteak in Arizona that taste so great. I highly recommended this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Gotta say I'm not as impressed with forefathers anymore. The sandwiches seem smaller and not as flavour as they used to be. For two sandwiches and one drink it cost over $20!!! That's really overpriced. Insanely overpriced!  Additionally during their busiest time they allow patrons who are no longer eating to just hang out while a line starts to form for those waiting for a table to open. We didn't have time to wait so we were forced outside in the 110° heat. No misters, no outdoor fans. We were sweating horribly and both of us just scarfed down our food just so we could get back into our air conditioned car. We didn't enjoy it at all. Either get a larger establishment or ask people to not hog tables when they're clearly done and its the busiest part of the day. Awful experience."}
{"text":"Mmm I hate to say this, but I wasn't impressed.  I got here at noon on a Sunday and the place was empty.  The menu was easy to follow, the lady at the register was nice, I like that they have free peppers and fry sauce (reminded me of Cane's sauce) next to the soda machine but the sandwich wasn't impressive.  When served, it looked like there was a ton of meat, but as soon as I took a bite, I realized that half of it was bread and the sandwich, in fact, had no problem closing.  I felt like there wasnt enough cheese on mine, but my boyfriend complained he had too much, a matter of perspective I suppose.  Or inconsistency.  Prices were average for a philly cheesesteak ($8.30 for a regular).  I'm not from Philly so I can't weigh in on whether it's authentic but I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"My first time in here. I had a chicken sandwith with onions, mushrooms and fries. The flavor was acceptable,  I wished they cut the chicken cubes in smaller size bites. The fries left oily on the plate. The fries sauce was great.  I also had steak sandwich.  It was good. The bread was great touch. I might go back to give another try."}
{"text":"A colleague recommended this place to me so, I went there today for the first time.  I asked if I could just make up what I wanted and they were so friendly and patient till I figured out what would fit my meal plan. I just asked for chicken and provolone in a bowl. The food tastes as good as the pictures look. The fries looked amazing too, but i am staying away from the bad stuff for now so I didn't try them. Overall, the service was great, friendly, fast, (super fast) fresh food and I have already recommended to several people!"}
{"text":"This place is really great, the food and the employees. I have come here a few times, I always get the Philly Original wit wiz and onion. I put some sweet peppers on it and sometimes sprinkle some malt vinegar over it. Th fries are yummy with the fry sauce. I like their iced tea and I like that they make a chilled espresso drink that you can pour yourself for the same price as a soda. The employees are really friendly, they say hi the minute you walk in, converse with you, and even offer advice. The guy behind the counter gave me and my kids free cookies, which were awesome by the way! This place seems pretty true to Pat's Steaks in Philadelphia with the chopped meat and cheese whiz, I am guessing it would taste similar."}
{"text":"YUMMY! Fabulous cheesesteaks! Huge size and totally worth the price! Sweet potato fries and regular fries were delicious also! Cool little place in a nice part of Tempe! Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"If you were one of the many like me that used to make the pilgrimage to Bruchi's CheeseSteaks in Ahwatukee, you were probably also disappointed when you arrived that one day to find them out of business.  For years following their closure I sampled cheesesteaks here and there, but none of them even came close to the taste of what Bruchi's delivered.  Then a co-worker introduced me to Forefathers Gourmet Cheesesteaks & Fries in Tempe and I struck gold. These guys can really turn out a great sandwich.  My favorite is the #2 Cheesesteak (with grilled onions and white American cheese). The regular size is more than enough to satisfy most appetites, but if you are really hungry go for the large. The fresh baked Italian bread is great and they offer a variety of different flavor cheesesteaks to choose from.  If you do a combo meal with regular fries, be sure to get some \"fry sauce\" near the soda dispenser for something a little different.  I highly recommend this place to anyone out there who loves a good cheesesteak. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Gotta be some of the best cheesesteaks I've ever had. People are very friendly and fast! A must for steak lovers!"}
{"text":"One of the best cheese steaks I have ever had I recommend this place crew was very nice place was clean and peppers was awesome"}
{"text":"Delicious every time! Never been to Philly but I guess I never need to. Get it with whiz, that's the best way."}
{"text":"My wife and I just ate at your great restaurant in Tempe tonight! What attracted me was the name, \"Forefathers,\" wondering if it had a patriotic flavor, and it did! The Cheesesteaks and fries were amazing, and I love the pictures of Washington, Jefferson, and Franklin on the wall, along with the American flag captioned with \"In God We Trust\" on the outside window. The staff was especially courteous, friendly, and professional too! We're new to AZ and will make Forefathers a regular stop."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Cheesesteak I have ever had! The meat was juicy and the mushrooms and onions were cooked perfectly too! The fry sauce was out of this world. We also tried the tomato bisque which was extremely tasty! I only wish we had one back home in California."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak I've had in town so far.  This is about the 6th place I've been.  I'll drive the 30 miles round trip just to get their sandwich."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good cheesesteak place in Tempe and I think I've finally found it. A bit expensive but the cheesesteak and fries were very delicious and you have to try their fry sauce!!"}
{"text":"This place is legit! I got the OMG Chicken Cheesesteak, and it hit the spot. Clean restaurant with friendly staff. We will be back."}
{"text":"Yummy!  A high quality sandwich on DELICIOUS bread.  Unlimited sides of sweet & hot peppers."}
{"text":"The customer service is probably the best I have ever experienced. Actual genuinely friendly people that are HELPFUL from when you walk in till you walk out.  Food is real good too. (I ignore the fact that some people put wiz on a cheesesteak.) Nice clean place. ...and the cookies. Get a cookie. They are a treat.  They had highchairs for my little one. Even though he deceided he wanted to sit on top of the table.   You will see me there again.  *Update*** downgrade from 5 Stars to 3 Stars   We went there a while back and they changed their sweet potato fries!!! I got some to go and started to snack on them in the car. I immediately noticed they were different than the ones I love, so called them. I asked if they changed their fries and he said yes. I asked if it was permanent or they just ran out or something. He said these are the fries from now on.  Until they go back to the old ones I probably wont go there nearly as often. The fries are that big of a deal. :(  2nd Update*** upgrade from 3 to 4 I has been a while and the sweet potato fries are pretty tasty now. And the service is still as good as ever."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent, excellent when it comes to cheesteaks. After my first bite I knew they had earned a customer for life. Friendly, fast service. I will be a regular."}
{"text":"Best Philly cheesesteaks I've had in Phoenix!! Good quality and tastes great!! Be sure to try the sauces...Jalapeño ranch and fry sauce yum! Nice people too :)"}
{"text":"Yummy! I love the Buffalo Chicken Cheesesteak and the sweet potato fries. Really great food and decent prices, especially for the quantity of the food."}
{"text":"WOWZA! If your a fan of sweet potato fries then Christmas has come early..... simply put, the combination of Forefathers fry sauce and sweet potato fries is enough to make you loose your marbles.  Now as for the Cheesesteaks.... they are awesome.  I've had some good ones here and there but Forefathers takes the cake.  Overall I was very impressed.  Im not from the east coast so I cant make a real comparison, but come on if your in AZ then who cares about the east coast really (the food is so bland and boring usually).    Friendly staff, casual environment ..... you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! The food is good, the service is fast and the people are friendly! It's a bit packed in there, but who cares if you're squeezed in, when the rest is so awesome!"}
{"text":"Very good food! Love the taste with the cheese wiz..Yeh, I'm easy to please having grown up on cheese wiz. Had the large cheesesteak work meat and cheese only. Tasted great to me...won't know till I go to Philly how close to the real deal it is. Had the cheese fries too! Satisfied customer! Only knock is the price for the large...I could of ate 2 of them effortlessly...but after getting cheese fries and a drink, almost $14 just for me. Great food though...now to my wife's leftovers!"}
{"text":"It's Saturday night and I have not eaten much all day.  I had read some reviews about Philly cheesesteaks and was kind of craving one.  I checked around on Yelp and found Forefathers.  So off we went!   We pulled up and walked in, looked at the menu on the wall and ordered.  I had the standard cheessteak with peppers and onions and sweet potato fries.  My daughter had the \"fox\" off the children's menu.  It was chicken strips and fries with a drink.  The young man working the counter was polite and friendly.  We got our drinks and sat down.  There are about 12 tables inside and about 5 outside.  The place was was clean and tidy.  When my order was ready I went to pick it up and the young man asked if there was anything else I needed.  I said no, we were good but when I went back to the table they had forgotten the ranch for my daughter's chicken strips.  She is 7 and very independent so she went up to ger her ranch.  The young man was apologetic and asked and gave her two cups of ranch instead of one.  She was happy.  And she said her meal was yummy.  My cheesesteak was so good.  Great flavor, tendor meat and fresh roll.  And the cheese just oozed out.....yum! The sweet potato fries were great too.  Refillable drinks too.   While we were eating my daughter was looking at the pictures of Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson.  We had a nice little history lesson while we were eating.  She also liked the lighting.  She said it looked like a party.  There were lights draped from the ceiling along with the regular lighting and with the high ceilings it did have a sort of patio feeling.    Being a parent I have probably seen bathrooms in every place we have ever been to, the grocery store, gas station, and restaurants. The restroom here was fantastic.  When I opened the door it was not at all what I expected.  It had nice tile and the faucet had a fancy spikett that turned on automatically when you put your hands under it.  There was a nice smelling soap and lots of paper towels too.  And it smelled nice in there!!  Yes, it smelled nice!  Not like a bathroom at all and it was clean!!    I'm not from Philly but  I know what I like and this was a darn good cheesesteak!  Thank you Forefathers!!"}
{"text":"I travel to Philly on business quite often, this is as good as any cheese steak I have had in Philly,  and is the best I have found in Phoenix.   Get the #1 \"Wit Wiz\" to be the most authentic.   Also, try the sweet potato fries..  On a side note, my friend wanted soup, and got the tomato basil bisque, and he said it was delicious (I had not even noticed they served soup)."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  A very solid cheesesteak joint.  A little pricier than your average steak, but still very good and worth the price.  Standard steak, with onions and wiz.  That's my point of comparison.  The bread here is a liiiiitle too hard, but it's close.  It's chewy and it stands up to the cheese and meat juices.  The meat is well seasoned, tender, and they give you enough wiz.  I'm a sucker for their salad here, mostly because of their house dressing.  I don't know why I love it so much, but the salad alone almost warrants 4 stars for this place. Their fries are fine.  I am not a huge fan of their fry sauce, it's lacking a little something.  But, bonus points to them for putting a couple different types of hot peppers for your steak.  So did the whole Pat's, Geno's, Dalessandro's thing (which are in reverse order of my favorites, still have to try Tony Luke's), so I can't give this place 5 stars.  But it's very good, the place is clean and the staff is friendly and like I said, they don't skimp on the wiz."}
{"text":"Love this place. I was born and raised in the Philadelphia area. Since moving to Arizona every cheesesteak has left me disappointed. This is the best thing I've found! Build your own cheesesteak or chicken cheesesteak with lots of options and cheeses! People are extremely nice and wonderful at explaining their menu. I will definitely come here the next time I'm craving a cheesesteak!"}
{"text":"Quick service and a freshly prepared, delicious chicken cheesesteak sandwich.  The self-serve pepper fridge is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Holy insanely delicious, Batman! You must try the cheese whiz....it's crazy good. If you get the fries, make sure to use their special fry sauce. Quick friendly service and delicious food....I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A small place with nice decor and seating outside.  I had the steak philly with wiz OMG hold the g.  I am a fan and will be back.  The staff was nice. Friendly from the moment I walked in and even thank yous on the way out.   It was half full at 2pm.  I can imagine this place could get crazy busy.  My order was ready in minutes.  I too liked the to go containers of fry sauce and jalapeños.    I'm not the eco friendliest person, yet I wonder why 3 monitors are needed to display the menu when it could be on a printed board.  It's the trendy thing to do now with monitor menus, yet the prices and items are not changing that frequently.   Seems a waste of electricity.   Off that rant, a great place, great philly,  friendly staff.  My new favorite sandwich place."}
{"text":"Lots of friends & coworkers from the East Coast spoke highly of this place, so I decided to stop through after my post office run.  I spent a few minutes trying to fully understand the menu and how it was setup, as I was assuming it was like any other steak spot I've visited... Wrong!! I'm not a big fan of mushrooms, onions, & peppers on my sandwich so I figured to add lettuce & tomatoes... yeah, they don't have that as an option and that's what I was looking for to add to my sandwich.   Decided to go with American Cheese and just steak and asked what else I could add to my sandwich given that they didn't have tomatoes and lettuce. I ended up adding their personalize fry sauce to give it some 'flair'.   Lunch ran me $13 for a regular sandwich regular fries and a drink.  Food was ready quickly and I was very much surprised at the taste and quality of the meat along with the bread!!! Fries were good too and the nice thing is they have condiments like fry sauce, variety of peppers and other items that you can grab from the fridge at the condiment station.  My only downside was i couldn't add lettuce and tomatoes, but I do understand for my steak and cheese guru's that is not the right thing to add... still good experience!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here and I cannot thank him enough for finally showing me this hidden beauty! Food was unreal, I especially loved all of the available variety+additions you could add to your cheesesteak. Plenty of different choices for me to keep coming back because it's just that good.  Staff was all extremely friendly, and the overall sense of the shop was very comfortable. I can't wait to return and show all my friends this place, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Like the review I wrote yesterday, I wish I could give it three and a half stars, but since I can't it gets four. Why?  Well, they basically do one thing and they do it well--cheesesteak. I got one with provolone and raw onions and it was really great--real steak, a little light on the cheese but not too bad, and just the right about of chopped onions. The bread was soft and tasty also, obviously freshly baked. Yes, I know provolone and raw onions is heresy to someone from Philly, but since I'm from Indiana I don't care. Cheese wiz? You can have it. Anyway, with real cheese these things are good. As a bonus, they offer three types of peppers in the condiment bar, which put the place over the top for me. I'll leave it to others to judge the \"genuine\" Philly style sandwich.   Service was also good and friendly, and the place is as clean as anyplace I've been. The only complaint I have is it is a little expensive. I spent a little over $11 for a large sandwich and a coke with no sides. Also, if you don't like cheesesteak you're kind of out of luck. But what they do they do very well. I'll certainly be back. The only reason I would have given it three and a half rather than four stars is because of the price.   And those four and five star reviews I've been writing? I promised myself I would only write about restaurants I have eaten at since I started writing these reviews. I promise when I eat at a bad restaurant I won't mince words! I have a whole bunch in mind, but I want to wait and give them another chance."}
{"text":"I remember going into Forefathers the first day they were open. The owner still recognizes me when I go in. Gotta love a family owned business turning out the best product n the city and doing well. This place sells itself but in case you are in doubt about the best Philly Cheese Steak in the city, take the Pepsi challenge you will become a believer."}
{"text":"So I have to say I've been working next to this restaurant for almost a year and have only had the salads which are soooo good!  I had a client in my chair (I'm a stylist) and she said they had the best cheese steaks. So on my break I decided to go have lunch! I got the cheese wiz cheese steak added  onion and peppers. OMG! SOOOOOO GOOD! The employees here are super friendly everytime I have gone.  If you haven't tried it you should definitely go here!  Also super fast!"}
{"text":"The Cheesesteak Saga continues...  I had given up on Forefathers after a visit about a year ago resulted in a greasy steak with sparse, over flavored meat. But a recent return trip was better and showed why so many like the place.  A decent steak. I like the cheese options, as only tourists go for wiz. Provolone is the tip.   Meat was overall pretty good quality, though like many local sandwich places, there's not enough of it. They still over season. Good steak doesn't need to hide behind black pepper.  Serving peppers on the side is a nice touch. Found the fries, both traditional and sweet potato, to be good. Nothing remarkable.  Place is a little pricey compared to some competitors, but in all, a pretty good option for a displaced cheesesteak lover."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch to get a cheesesteak and it was fantastic.  Lightly buttered, toasted, soft bun, and plenty of meat, onions, mushrooms, and green peppers on top.  If you don't want cheese wiz then you can get it with provolone or mozzarella... but the wiz is what makes it!  It's not overly oily or greasy, and really hits the spot when you're craving a cheesesteak.  Make sure you get some of their fry sauce, which is just a variation of thousand island dressing (but is so good).  At this price point you could probably get something a little healthier and tastier, but when you want one, you want one, and this is the place to get it.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"really really good.  Quick, efficient service, lots of options.  Counter staff didn't mind stupid questions (what is fry sauce?) Excellent sandwich, lots of lean flavorful meat, served on a really great roll."}
{"text":"First time today and I'm with it... I had the cheesesteak with American peppers and onions and fry sauce and I wasn't disappointed. They're could've been a little more meat on it if there was one downfall I felt like there was a lot of bites of mostly bread and no meat but it was still very good. Staff was mostly in the back besides for when I ordered and weren't very outgoing but weren't rude either so I can't complain I will definitely be back when I'm craving a cheesesteak. The $9 price tag for a regular cheesesteak seems a little high though"}
{"text":"I got a cheesesteak with provolone, peppers, onions, and mushrooms. It was really good! The fries are crispy, which was good news. They seem to make a big deal about the Fry Sauce but it was pretty basic. Overall, I would recommend this place and definitely see myself going back."}
{"text":"I liked this place.  Next time I go back, I won't ask for cheese-whiz on my Philly.  Also, I'll pass on the iced coffee which is way too sweet for my tastes."}
{"text":"Honestly the best cheesesteak outside of Philadelphia!! Even better than a lot of those in Philadelphia!   Every time I come here I intend on getting a regular size but always end up ordering a large instead. The cheesesteaks and fries are amazing!!! This place is always between steady and busy as far as customer traffic goes, but they always serve up a perfect cheesesteak pretty fast!   If you want a great cheesesteak come here! I guarantee you will keep coming back! So addicting!!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and service. Consistent hot and fresh cheesesteaks! Fries are amazing! I've been going here for 3 years and nothing has changed for the worse. Clean establishment, they obviously take pride in everything they do."}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant and really good cheesesteaks.  Good variety on the menu between cheesesteaks and chickencheesesteak sandwiches.  Consistenly good."}
{"text":"The place to go for as close to Philly as you can get in AZ.  Everything is perfect about their cheesesteak including the whiz"}
{"text":"We ate lunch here a few days ago, and loved it. Big cheese steak lovers in my family, so we are pretty picky. Had mine with provalone cheese and it was so good. Also got the spicy blue cheese on top which was  great. Prices are a little high ($11 for a large amd $8 for a regular) but well worth it every once in a while if you are craving meat. Will return."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Small menu but several options for cheese which I enjoy. Not everyone wants cheez wiz. They also offer chicken, not just steak as well as salads. They always ask if peppers, onions, and mushrooms are okay, and you can decline some or all of them. A little pricey for a sandwich if you want a combo. About $12-13 if you get the regular size with fries and a drink. They do offer \"free\" drinks with purchase of fries but I think the best way to go is to get the mini combo if you want more than just a sandwich. Still one of my go to places. Will be back and highly recommend. Also they offer outdoor seating :)"}
{"text":"If this place was any closer to my house, I'd weigh twice as much. If you're not a vegetarian, give this place a shot. Just do it.   I was introduced to this place many years ago when I worked in the area and would come by periodically for lunch. As much as I love cheesesteaks, man cannot live on cheesesteak alone... though a good argument could be made that a cheesesteak is a balanced meal: meat, dairy (cheese), grain (bread) and veggies (peppers). Maybe get a salad and skip the fries to balance it out a little more :)  I am not from Philly, nor do I know what a \"real\" Philly steak looks like, but these guys know how to make a grilled shaved steak sandwich. The beef is cooked perfectly (a good amount of \"drip,\" not dried out) and the bread is really fresh. Even if I were thinking about cutting back on carbs, I'd have to make an exception for their bread. The portions are large enough that the \"regular\" sandwich is more than I really need to eat, but not so much that I have leftovers.   I got my sandwich with Provolone this time. It was OK. I usually get the Whiz and recommend that with peppers and mushrooms. Whatever you do, don't leave the cheese off; that's an abomination.   :D"}
{"text":"This place makes my heart happy!! This is the best place to get a good Philly cheesesteak sandwich. They also have better sweet potato fries than anywhere in town. Don't forget the fry sauce! It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Ordered a cheesesteak with onions and Wiz and fries. Everything was pretty good. Would have been better if I wasn't an idiot who got lost on the way there and left my order sitting for so long but that's my fault, not theirs. I'm sure I will be back. Also, the large sandwich is huge, my coworker thought I ordered more than one."}
{"text":"Some of the best cheesesteaks in AZ hands down! I've been to a couple places and they are good but these are on a night level. Plus their customer service in always on point. Go try them out ASAP. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Forefathers is decent. I had a regular steak (low carb style) with a side of cheese fries. It's a bit pricy but it is a good amount of food. Overall came out to about $14 for my meal which came with a drink. The atmosphere is very casual and the food was ready very quickly.  The food however was just too salty. The best part was the sweet potato fries. They were delicious. I didn't finish my cheese fries though just because they cheese was too salty. Again, it was a good experience but I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Cheesesteak with cheese wiz and all the fixings was interesting and pretty good.   Recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Great food. The sweet potato fries are excellent like other Yelpers pointed out. I got the steak philly with cheese whiz. Thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"And so... I was born and raised in Philadelphia, so I'm skeptical when anyone tells me, \"\"This is the best cheesesteak outside of Philly. No really!  Trust me\". It usually turns out to be a hot roast beef sandwich with kraft singles.   Alas, a coworker told me about Forefathers, to which my skepticism stayed high, that is until I walked in. There on the wall was a picture of Pat's, Geno's, and Jim's. And in that moment, I understood the name.   With a twinge in my heart for my beloved city, although I love Phoenix, it will never compare to Philadelphia. I walked to order and saw cheez wiz on the menu board. Impressive thus far, but signs and menu boards do not a cheesesteak make.   I ordered.  I smelled the onions.  I saw the rolls on the counter. I saw an order that looked like \"the best cheesesteak outside of Philly. No really!  Trust me.\"  I ate.  I cried. (Ok, not really but...)  Pros: Thinly chopped steaks, not sliced beef. If you don't know the difference, then F YOU.   Chucks of onions, not sliced. Cheez wiz!    Cons: Not enough salt.  Good rolls. Not Amoroso or Sarcone, but good.   Thanks, Forefathers. You've restored my faith in humanity.  Yo!"}
{"text":"Been here  twice now since we moved here D licious! Clean, fast , friendly! The blue cheese dip is to die for Good job"}
{"text":"Simply put this place has the best Cheesesteak sandwiches in town !!! Oh and it comes with great customer service as well. My only dilemma is trying to figure out which one I want, steak or chicken !!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure about all the love of this place.  It was good but I'm very surprised that this many people enjoyed it.  The bread was good and the fact that they have Wiz is great but the steak itself was just decent.  I mostly gave them 4 stars because of their selections and options.  Chicken option, provolone option, Wiz option, salads, etc.  That's pretty awesome if you ask me. Was it the best cheese steak ever?  No.  Was it better than Corleones? YES."}
{"text":"I have visited this place many times since my move to Arizona. This is the place to go if you ever are in the mood for a cheesesteak sandwich. You can get it anyway you want it:  chicken or steak, with or without onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, and your choice of cheese. If you decide to get fries or even the sweet potato fries, be sure to get their special fry sauce to dip them! It's pretty good!  And what I love about this place is that their cheesesteaks is that there's not a lot of grease as you would imagine there would be - it's quite opposite, so you don't wind up with soggy gross bread!   Anywho....go check them out!"}
{"text":"We were sitting at home this Saturday night watching the Travel Channel and Pat and Gino's was on. Immediately I was home sick (PA girl here) and suddenly hungry. I Googled Philly Cheesesteaks in Arizona and Forefathers came up, even better it was less than 5 minutes from our house. I saw they closed at 8 and it was already 7:30, we grabbed the keys and off we went. When we got there a table of 12 was finishing up as well as another of 2, 3 people came in behind us so we did not feel too bad being late comers. We were pleasantly welcomed by the staff and ordered our food. A few more patrons would trickle in both to dine and get take out. My husband and I both agreed our sandwiches were delicious. He got the original with cheez-wiz and peppers and I had the cheesesteak with onion and american. I thought it was nice that they came out in the dining room to ask how it was, a few people even came in at 8:02 and they we more than happy to serve them unlike other places that will turn you away 5-10 before closing. We will defitnitley be back, I am anxious to try the pizza steak on my next go around. Glad to have found you!"}
{"text":"This place ruined my life: I'm from out of state and visiting friends here in Tempe and now I won't be able to have this every day like I'm going to want to. Two words: CHEESE WHIZ. Only got the cheese steak (no sides or dessert) and I'm already craving another (...it's only been a few minutes since I've finished eating). The service was great and the cheese steaks were done quickly - I got the white American with the extra drizzle of cheese whiz and it was amazing. They have a fridge full of extra peppers which I was tempted to just sit and eat (dipped in their house fry sauce stuff - also amazing). Go here. Eat everything. Thank me later.  Update: had to come back (even though I just ate it yesterday) - came during lunch rush, still super speedy and delicious. Added cheese fries this time and they were also perfect. Cheesesteak-wise the large is about two regular sizes put together which you could split (for those budget conscious folks like myself)."}
{"text":"Forefathers is truly an American establishment in my opinion due to that they serve cheesesteaks as ordered by the customer. I do recommend to first experience their original Steak Cheesesteak with Wiz and grilled onions to base your experience before creating your science experiments."}
{"text":"Great cheesesteak! Combination of Pabst and cheesesteak would've been awesome if they offered it in the menu..that's just my suggestion for the owner :-)"}
{"text":"As a Philadelphia native, finding a local cheesesteak place is tough... this place is pretty darn close... whether for lunch or dinner, always consistent... worth the minimal price for extra meat... awesome side sauce for sweet potato fries... the fact that this place is always busy is a good sign... very helpful and cheerful staff!"}
{"text":"I ordered my all time favorite, steak and chicken, WIZ (a must for a genuine philly), and provolone, peppers, onions, and marinara. My childhood favorite I made working as a cook in Pennsylvania, and it was just as good as back home. Made my day, to finally find a good cheese steak in arizona, after 13 years here. Really great service, over all really stoked, and will be back."}
{"text":"Best damn Cheesesteak I've ever encountered! I'm no expert but the cheese wiz (which I would never normally try) is a must! If I could stay fit and eat these delicious pieces of heaven everyday I would! Worth the cheat day meal"}
{"text":"I can't stop going here. There isn't a better place in town for quality and value. A meal should cost $15 of this quality and I pay $10.88 every time and never eat it all.  Reg steak cheesesteak w/ Wiz, add \"OMG\" and buffalo sauce (which are both free to add FYI) and fried (best fries in town) you get a drink free with that for $10.88. And all you can get FRY SAUCE which you can't get anywhere except Utah and Idaho - this place needs to expand to where I live :)"}
{"text":"Been here twice.. both times got the cheesesteak with mozzarella and sweet potato fries. The sandwich is very good and you can choose your type of cheese and if you want peppers mushrooms and onions or not. The sweet potato fries are great as are the regular ones (okay I may have stole a few of my friend's fries when they weren't looking. The fry sauce is bomb and I will be back."}
{"text":"Great place for a delicious cheesesteak!!! My only recommendation is to toast the bread first to give a little of a crisp!"}
{"text":"This place is the best in AZ, hands down.. no comparison.  great size steak sandwiches...  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"T'was a good lunch. Got the cheesesteak OMG + whiz and tomato bisque. Came during lunch peak but service was still fast and made  to order. Sandwich packed with meat and veggies came out hot and seasoned well. The bisque was thick and creamy. All in all $12. A bit steep but okay once in a while.   While great tasting, can't imagine eating this all the time and staying slim. Will be back when craving something hearty and hefty."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and have left happy each and every time. I get the steak cheesesteak with cheese whiz and fries. I love getting the fry sauce.   Service: very accommodating, they greet you right away, and check on you after you get your food.   Decor: very nice with lots of seating. Bathrooms are amazing and always clean.   5/5 stars and would recommend trying this!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!  It is close to work and I have been going there for years.  The food and service is consistently good.  I like how you can see them making your food and the employees are always working hard. It's pricy at $9 for a regular sandwich but for good quality I'll pay it."}
{"text":"This place has great cheesesteak!! Good portion sizes. The sweet potato fries were so crispy and delicious. And the fry sauce is amazing!! Such good flavor here. And I love that you can get a low carb bowl!! Totally worth the money, although it is a little on the pricier side. But their mini portion is more than enough for lunch. So I liked that deal cuz I got fries, a drink and cheese steak bowl for $8. Not too bad!"}
{"text":"Excellent cheese steak anyway you want it. Order fries extra crispy they are killer."}
{"text":"Forefathers is definitely our new regular treat. From \"one nation under God\" at the door, to the \"Ultimate Sacrifice\" wall, everything about this neighborhood spot represents the awesomeness of America. The awesomeness of opportunity, capital and making a kick ass cheesesteak thats better than any other west of the Mississippi River."}
{"text":"Excellent! Tried Forefathers for the first time today and was impressed. Went for the beef with onions and Cheese Whiz. The bread was fresh and a great texture, the beef was cooked right with no \"mystery meat\" and the large size was certainly large. The cheese fries were fresh and cooked great as well. The only complaint I'd have wasn't the food, but the fact that even though it was an off time on a Saturday the dining room wasn't clean with trash on the floor and only a couple table tops not in need of wiping. But that has never stopped me from jamming my face with cheesy meaty goodness, so I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was so happy with my choice of cheese whiz over provolone.  Normally I love provolone, but my husband ordered his cheesesteak with provolone and it was lacking in flavor.  If you ask me, the whiz makes the cheesesteak.  Try the sweet potato fries with their house sauce."}
{"text":"Now this place is sooooooooo good.  The flavor, the meat, the quality of the bread is so fresh and soft, the fries cooked perfectly and that fry sauce is pure heaven.  Really good service as well.  I don't think there is a better cheesesteak in the valley.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is really expensive.  I think it was $14 or $15 for a cheesesteak and fries and a drink. If I were to bring my family here it would be about $60 bucks for a family of four....not ideal for cheesesteaks.  Other than that it was really really yum"}
{"text":"Finally, a decent cheesesteak! If they had birch beer we might be talkin five star territory. But as is, good steaks and fries for this far west."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, before a night out on mill, and It was good, but I was expecting to like It more. Don't get me wrong, It was really good, but don't you hate It when u eat, then your thirsty, so your drinking glasses full to ease the thirsty-ness,then you get even thirsty-er, so you drink more, and It just gets worse and worse until your so full you can't drink anymore!!!!! But your still thirsty!!!! No? Just me? Ugh, I digress!.. While I was here It got pretty busy and loud, which I didn't mind at all. I like the atmosphere and really liked the cheesesteaks. It was pretty huge, and the fries with cheese sauce were really good! I would come back here, but maybe not right before a night out, I'm pretty sure with all the water I drank I looked about 6 months prego!! :)"}
{"text":"I've had a few cheese steaks in my time and while this one isn't bad, it just doesn't impress, especially for the price.  I ended up over $10 and didn't even get fries.  It just seems like this should be a $6.50 meal and that's the only reason it gets there instead of four stars.  The staff is friendly (ironic that you can't call this authentic, getting one in Philly will be more abrupt) and fast.  The various pepper selections are nice, turns out jalapeños are a welcome addition to a cheese steak.  Overall though, I just have to come back to price.  A cheese steak with fries and a drink will set you back $14!  I can find solid lunch any time for less than $10."}
{"text":"My husband said \"best cheese steak he's ever had\". We were both born and raised in south Jersey just 20 minutes outside of Philly. We have eaten plenty of cheesesteaks and tried lots of places that claim to be \"Philly authentic\". We dined inside the restaurant on a Thursday around 2pm. The atmosphere and decor inside is very modern and clean. Very welcoming and comfortable. The guy who took our order was super friendly and helpful. The food came out fast and they offer sides like try sauce and peppers out in the dining area so you can go back for more at any time. The food was delicious! Everything was hot and cooked to perfection. We will definitely be back every time we are in the area (it is less than a mile from Ikea)."}
{"text":"My husband is a huge fan of cheesesteaks and I never really have been.  After eating at this place, I can finally understand why he loves cheesesteaks so much.    We came here after reading the reviews on Yelp, of course.  It's a small place with sufficient seating (outdoor seating also).  Very clean inside.  The employees are friendly and do not rush you with your order.  After eating at a different cheesesteak place, I had become weary of ordering whiz on my sandwich.  My husband bit the bullet and decided to try it, however, and after taking a bite of his, I wish I had did the same!  Their whiz is not that crap you find in a jar on the shelf in Walmart.  It has flavor and it compliments their cheesesteaks amazingly!  I had my cheesesteak with mozzarella or provolone (whichever is on the menu.. it's been a couple months since trying this place and I'm just now finding time to write up the review).  The cheesesteak is delicious by itself, but I definitely would have liked the whiz better.  These sandwiches are HUGE.  Glad I ordered the smaller one, because there's no way I could have eaten all of mine by myself.  Considering the cost, the portions are great!  Their fries were awesome, as well.  Next time, we'll try the sweet potato variety.  Never been a huge fan of them, because nobody can seem to make them taste good, but this place won't let me down, I'm sure! :)  If you like cookies -- grab a cookie from there!  They seem to be fresh baked and made in-house.  I could be wrong about that, but either way they are damn good!  Will be going back when we wander out that way again.  Will definitely be a staple destination spot anytime we find ourselves needing to go to IKEA, since it's nearby. :)"}
{"text":"YUMMMMMM!!!! I was brought to this place by a friend and was so glad to find it! Very clean and unique casual setting. Staff were very friendly, food was hot, fresh and amazingly gooy...definately a 4+ napkin kind of meal. So happy to see they serve Chicken philly -steak as well as the usual philly cheese steak and sweet potatoe fries! Find out where this place is because it could be easily over looked and you would be missing out on some deeee-licous food. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"This place is a favorite of mine. Authentic cheesesteak sandwiches at a reasonable price. They also have fry sauce!! If you are not familiar with fry sauce, get familiar!  Great location, always busy, but that is a good thing! I'm just glad it's not closer to my home, I'd be fat...ter."}
{"text":"Prices are a bit high. The sandwiches are mediocre at best. The funny part is that they don't give military discounts. I don't quite understand why there's pictures of cows on the wall."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is absolutely delicious, I usually get the cheese steak with cheese whiz, onions and mushrooms. I go with my husband on his lunch break and we usually hit the lunch rush, but they are extremely fast at getting food out! I can't say enough good things about this place :)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars!  Came here on whim when this other cheesesteak spot we wanted to try out was closed for the day.  We had a long day of furniture shopping ahead of us and we needed to fill our tummies.  Enter Forefathers!  The establishment itself is very clean and modern.  The staff was patient while we studied the menu and they seemed like a happy bunch.  I had ordered a regular cheesesteak  provolone and some plain crispy fries .  I almost regret not getting it with Cheez Whiz and OMG style but I figured I didn't need all that cheese filling me up and onions and peppers just didn't draw me in.  I did end up having to dump some fry sauce into my cheesesteak after the provolone got cold and it became a bit dry to eat.  I think this sandwich had great flavor and it's pretty hefty and filling.  The price is a bit steep but you do get a lot of meat [although not fresh].  It's a solid and decent cheesesteak."}
{"text":"HOLY MOSES. I went here for lunch on the advice of my co-worker and I am so stoked I did.  Being Deaf, I am sometimes wary of ordering in loud places, and although Forefathers wasn't exceptionally loud, there was enough noise that I struggled with ordering and hearing. The guy taking my order was super nice and very understanding, he even wrote out what I ordered to make sure it was correct (HUGE BROWNIE POINTS FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE THERE... THAT GUY SHOULD GET A RAISE). My food only took about 5 minutes to get to me, and by the time I had filled my drink and gotten together napkins (which were REALLY, REALLY needed), it was ready.  I got the mini cheesesteak with provolone, onions, green peppers, and mushrooms, mini fries, a cookie, and a drink - all for $8.30. The roll was soft and delicious, and the meat & veggies were unbelievably flavorful. The cookie was just as amazing as the other reviews said it would be - gooey and chewy on the inside. The mini meal was the perfect size for lunch, and even then I couldn't finish all of the fries.  Be advised: you WILL need like 500 napkins, moist towelettes, and possibly a shower after eating their cheesesteaks: SUPER messy, but SO worth it. I recommend this place without hesitation for their excellent customer service, clean restaurant, freakin delicious food, and awesome set up."}
{"text":"Voted #1 Philly In Arizona, by me. Trust me, I'm a connoisseur of Philly Cheesesteaks.  I've tried them everywhere you can think of in Arizona; if it's offered on the menu-I've had it.  Most places are really terrible at making them.  Forefathers is different.  They used the right cut of steak, the required white american cheese, onions and peppers.  They even had pickled cherry peppers-this was a strong indicator to me that they were going to be genuine! To top it all off, they had Fry sauce with their delicious and crispy french fries! Fry sauce is uncommon in AZ, so this was a total win.  I will be back, often. Great work people of Forefathers!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing. The food is incredible and the staff are super friendly and professional. My wife and I agree they serve up the best Philly cheesesteaks we've ever had. I love the fry sauce and my wife adored their sweet potato fries.   The prices are high but it is totally worth it. If you are in the mood for a great Philly cheesesteak, this is the place to go. I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Really good flavors the only reason I'm not giving a 5 star is it was a little to salty for my liking but awesome place will definitely comeback!!"}
{"text":"This has become a regular stop on my way to and from Tucson. Both my fiancé and I think it's the best cheesesteaks this side of the Mississippi. You will pay a gourmet price for a truly gourmet meal; this does not stop us. Though the menu is limited, they aspire to make what they offer amazing. The staff is very friendly and offer great advice if you're just not sure what to get. You cannot go wrong with a regular steak sandwich with provolone or mozzarella, an order of fries with a drink. If you're looking for a lighter side of things, the salads are equally as good. I recommend this place to everyone that finds themselves in the area. We will be back, many tines more."}
{"text":"This place by far beats Uncle Sam's in regards to the cheese they use, meats and peppers. The sandwiches are a really good size and I usually get a couple meals from each one. The staff is always friendly and service is prompt. Never had a bad experience here and highly recommend going if you want a great meal."}
{"text":"This place was very clean and service was great! The cashier had a great attitude and seemed like he loved his job!! Also the food was very food my girlfriend and I will be definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and hearing some word of mouth I finally had a chance to check out Forefathers.  It's umm, not rad.  It's not terrible either, but I would definitely drive several miles past it for Uncle Sam's or Corleone's.  For my money it's about a half a star above The Steak Escape or some similar abomination."}
{"text":"First things first, I did not get a cheesesteak.  In all honesty, I have no idea what possessed me and caused me to order what I did.  The BBQ Chicken Cheesesteak is a beastly concoction.  You get fresh bread slathered with wiz, loaded with barbecued chicken, and then topped with coleslaw.  Of course I added bacon too.  When we got our food I kind of stared at it for a while.  I wasn't sure what to do with it.  How was I supposed to pick it up?  That would just be lame.  Ready with an arsenal of wet naps in my purse, I dug in to the most precarious food eating situation I have ever found myself in.  The first bite left me drooling wiz.  The second bite had coleslaw covering my hands.  The third bite had chicken falling out.  You get the idea?  It was messy and it was wrong.  It was so wrong it was right.  I really dug this weird combination.  The bacon just really pushed the sandwich from great to stellar.  I have to mention that their barbecue sauce is really good!  It's barely sweet, really smokey, and it packs a lot of flavor.  The bottom line is that I really liked this place.  I would like to go back and just try a regular cheesesteak with some fries.  Why fries too?  Because they have FRY SAUCE!  Woot!"}
{"text":"I give my 5-star rating solely on the buffalo chicken sandwich.  You will be hard pressed to find another buffalo chicken sandwich that even comes close to matching this one.  The bread is soft and chewy, the sauce is perfection, couple all of that with quality chicken, grilled onions, celery and green peppers, you have yourself a work of art.  The side salad with the fresh made house vinaigrette is a perfect side to the sandwich.  I make sure to come to forefathers a couple times per month."}
{"text":"What should I have for dinner after IKEA?   Friend: \"How about Fore fathers?\" Me: \"What feathers?\"  When we pulled up, I was expecting sandwiches similar to subway. I was getting ready to complain until I saw the menu. It was much simpler and less confusing. All you need is to pick is the size of the bread, steaks or chicken, types of cheese you like and all 4 ingredients. Simple! I like!   While I was waiting for my sandwich to go, I peeked around the restaurant. It is small but well organized. Staffs are young but friendly and polite. They have a small refrigerator to keep hot peppers fresh and organized (and clean). I was very impressed. Their ice tea is delicious. They have few tables in the outdoor area if you want to enjoy the beautiful weather of Arizona.  When I got home, I couldn't wait to eat the sandwich. I have to admit that it was very messy and end up eating it folks and knives Lol... it was juicy, meaty and delicious. Neither one of us could finish ours because the meat portion was generous. Their sweet potato fries are definitely sweet and delicious. We couldn't finish all of it and save it in the refrigerator for tomorrow.   Next time when I am in the general area again, I will stop by here for sure."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what you get.  Roll was fair, a little spongy.  Meat was pretty tasteless and an odd texture.  This place would never survive in my native Philadelphia."}
