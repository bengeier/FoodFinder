{"text":"Our second visit here was not as exciting as the first unfortunately. We were in a little bit of a rush since we were heading to the Leafs game after.  The lights are a little too dim, and we spent way too much time waiting for our food than actually eating it.  We started with the Coconut Shrimp with Thai sauce, which was a little over battered, over fried and tasted a little stale, like it may have been frozen.  I had the Roasted Crispy Pork \"Osso Bucco\" as my main. Fred's does pretty well with presentation, as I was given the largest piece of pork I've ever had. Gigantic. However, past all of it there was a lot of fat, the skin was crispy and the frites were nice. It felt more of a novelty meal, I don't think I'd be able to eat it again."}
{"text":"We went there twice while we were visiting Toronto. The service and food was good.  I really liked the way they cook their steak very crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Jumbo Tiger shrimp is delicious and I think their Australian Pinot Noir is great for the price. I would not recommend the Tiramisu."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waitress never introduced herself first words that came out of her mouth were \"Drinks?\"  Portions were small and gross. Desert had  rotten fruits chopped up very fine. Not worth a penny. Try something else"}
{"text":"Came for Summerlicious dinner last night. Poor service - waitress kept forgetting to bring my my beer, served same appetizer  to customers that came later than us. Took forever for food or to pay the bill. Ordered prime rib medium but came well done. I would have gotten a better quality and larger serving at the Kegs! Wife ordered the lobster and it was tasteless.  Dessert was below average. The quality stopped me for wanting to try anything else or to check this place out again."}
{"text":"Awful awful, stay away. My friend ordered calamari and nachos. The salsa was absolutely from a jar, tasted like crap. Calamari was overcooked. I ordered roast beef, tasted like a Hungry Man frozen food entree. Waste of time and money!"}
{"text":"Went to Fred's Not Here for their Winterlicious Lunch Special today with a friend and were sat promptly once inside the restaurant. The server came over with a basket of bread and took our drink orders within two minutes of sitting down. My friend and I both had the Passion Martini which was very tasty and strong of vodka! As for our appetizers, we started with the grilled calamari which was very flavourful and the caesar salad which was amazing as they were not shy with the garlic (yum!). For our mains, I had the Lobster & Shrimp Risotto and it was cooked perfectly with large helpings of the seafood and very savoury. As for my friend, he had the Stilton Burger which he said was nice and juicy! (I believe him because I noticed him eating sloppily after each bite as the juices from the burger began to drip out and the buns becoming all soggy, hehe). For our two desserts, we had a chocolate banana mousse and a berry shortcake. Good sizes, not too big which ended the meal wonderfully. We both liked the berry cake better as it was a little lighter than the chocolate mousse. We certainly enjoyed ourselves and left the restaurant satisfied and full because the food was good with great value (3 course meal for only $20!) I would absolutely love to go back!"}
{"text":"We went to Fred's Not Here on the last day of Summerlicious.  For the cost of $35 our meal was phenomenal!  I was very happy with our food and the service we received.  I was mentioning to my fellow dinner companion that if they didn't like the menu offered for Summerlicious they could order from the regular menu (we were talking about the seafood portion of it) and I am assuming the gentleman who was maybe the manager or someone heard me say that and advised he would not recommend to order from the regular menu for seafood items since they were not as fresh as the Summerlicious items.  He explained due to the Summerlicious menu and how busy they had been most customers were ordering from that menu which meant the product for their regular menu was not the most fresh.  I LOVED the fact that he advised of this.  Most restaurants wouldn't tell you such a thing and allow you to order less then fresh food so that they don't lose money on their products but this gentleman actually cared as to what he was serving which was a welcome change!  I'm glad he advised of this because no one wants to get sick after eating a meal at a restaurant!  Our server Katrina was the best server I had ever had to date.  We were a party of four and she catered to each of us.  The food was served fast, was fresh, hot and delicious.  I still to this day am talking about how good our food was and how our waitress was so nice and friendly and did an excellent job.  Katrina I am sure you probably don't hear it a lot but you were one of the best servers I have ever had and you definitely deserve some recognition!!  This is the second time I have been to Fred's Not Here and the second time exceeded my expectations and my experience from the first time.  I  would definitely recommend it.  I would also advise if you were going to be going to this restaurant and during the Summerlicious or Winterlicious to make reservations as I had seen so many people turned away as the restaurant was fully booked on the day we went.  *My price range is based on the fact that our meal cost $35 for the dinner during Summerlicious*"}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious, and the restaurant was completely full.    Jump up Vegetable Soup: very spicy curried vegetable soup.  This was awesome.  Seafood Linguine: This was terrible.  The spaghetti tasted like it was mixed with watered-down cheap tomato sauce from a can.  It was watery and bland.  Some of the mussels were mushy and tasted fishy in a bad way, which means they are far from fresh.  The grilled king cod was very dry, and the blackened top made it taste bitter.  So, it was basically dry bitter fish.  My dining partner had the blue label burger and he enjoyed it.  We both enjoyed the fries that came with his entree."}
{"text":"I went to Fred's for winterlicious - we were kind of disappointed that they no longer were having seating after 9pm (as they had had in the past). That's not the way to drum up potential business to those who like to try new restaurants.   The steak was good - I really liked their lobster bisque. The desert selection was great! The selection was good for winterlicious - wide variety. I don't know if I would go back when it's not summerlicious or winterlicious though because I think it's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"The worst Summerlicious 2015 experience by far. I can say with 100% certainty that Fred was not there AND his waiters and chefs were not there either.  Dinner: Famous Crab & Lobster Bisque - The only reason for 1/5 rating. Probably one of the best bisques I've had but everything went downhill from here.  Steak Frites - I've had better steak elsewhere, really nothing to write home about.  Two Gnocchi - Worst gnocchi I've ever had. Poor quality and poorly prepared.  Slow Roasted Beef Short Ribs - Again, I've had better short ribs elsewhere. The mash potatoes were cold upon arrival and just a pile of mush. It reminded me of the Hungry Man side of mash potatoes you'd find in the frozen dinner sections of the grocery.  The food, service, and atmosphere were a huge disappoint. Oh and rude staff when you try to make reservations. To make matters worse, we missed the display of fireworks from the CN Tower that night for this place..."}
{"text":"Pretty good.   Went with a group of 8 for Winterlicious dinner ($38). Got the escargot-stuffed mushrooms (good), the steak frites (steak was tender, frites average) and cheesecake (which I took home). Service was a bit slow as we were a big group, but our meals all came out together and the server was pleasant enough. The first 2 bottles of wine I tried to order were sold out, and because of Winterlicious, the kitchen was apparently unable to provide me with an aioli, jus or gravy of any kind. Not sure if I'd pay regular price but it was a decent enough Winterlicious offering."}
{"text":"I was really excited  about trying the Summerlicious menu at Fred's and was ready for a delicious meal. Unfortunately, after a great appetizer of the famous lobster crab bisque with pastry top my prime rib entree sucker punched me with a overcooked under seasoned punch.The sides of buttered green peas and yukon mash were undercooked and sickly-looking. The dessert was a creamy slice of cheesecake with raspberry sauce.  Our server was a bit creepy and did everything very slowly including refilling water glasses. The restaurant design itself is a mish-mash of very-tired looking 70s wallpaper, kitschy statuettes and one weird solitary puppy picture. Compared with other Summerlicious experiences it was definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"This was a walk in place that my wife and I came across. The food we ordered was very delicious. Atmosphere is very nice and comfortable. Layout is odd but the seats we sat in were good and placed appropriately. Waitress was a little awkward."}
{"text":"Helpful staff and ok food. the filet wrapped with bacon reminded me of soemthing that came from Omaha Steaks - prepackaged.  It wasn't horrible .. but it wasn't the best steak i've had either.   the sirloin strip looked better then the filet .. and i ordered it medium, however it seemd more medium well."}
{"text":"A lovely restaurant, but other than the novelty of the duck fat fries, nothing special.   I went here for lunch during Winterlicious and was satisfied with the service and food. It meets King West standards, but it's just another restaurant.   The waiter was attentive, the tableware was lovely, and the ambiance was pleasant. I especially love their trendy curved Viking-horn style cups. Seeing the reviews here I tried the Lobster and Crab soup but I didn't find it worth the high praise. The bread baked on top was great for show but it was just a spicy orange seafood soup. I ordered the steak and cheesecake which were good, but nothing earth-shattering.  What I did enjoy was the duck fat fries. Flavorful, thin and less guilty-worthy than street vendor fries, I might come again purely for more.   The only thing I would say is that besides the window seating, the restaurant is fairly dark. It is also a cloth-napkin kind of place.   All in all, a positive experience. Fred's Not Here is perfect for a casual lunch."}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious today and got the baked lobster and crab soup, steak with duck fat frites, and chocolate avalanche cake. I went in with really high expectations, perhaps too high. The soup was creamy and peppery with a soft, baked pastry crust on top. I thought there would be chunks of meat in the soup but there weren't, and I was a little disappointed. The steak, medium rare, was nicely cooked but really salty for some reason. The duck fat frites were a nice portion and a little sweet. The chocolate cake was average but a friend got the fruit ice cream which looked really nice as there were three large scoops in three different flavours.  As for the service and actual vibe: the waitress was very nice and I liked the surrealist mural on the wall. The place was packed shortly after 12 noon, but thankfully, I booked in advance for our large group. Lots of other young adults, probably also attracted by the Winterlicious menu, were dining as well. If I were to recommend this place, it would only be during Winter- or Summerlicious."}
{"text":"Sadly I was disappointed. Went on Valentine's Day with a reservation and they were not prepared. Waitress was rushed and rude. My white wine was warm. Very little attention was paid to us. The food was okay but nothing extraordinary. My spouse has a gluten allergy and one of the reasons we chose this place was because it advertised gluten free pasta - but the waitress was very negative about it and said it would take too long to make it, so she felt uncomfortable ordering it and ended up getting a salad and soup - except that the soup never came (and the waitress tried to to talk us out of that one too and I guess just decided to not bother putting it in). We would have said something but by the time she bothered to come and check on us it was too late. Really too bad since I'd heard good things about the place. Would not recommend it. If for nothing else, avoid for the terrible service. We are now sitting at Hero Burger so that my spouse can actually eat food."}
{"text":"We were really excited to dine for Winterlicious.. This excitement soon diminished upon our arrival.   We arrived at 6.57 for our 7pm reservation - We were greeted by the manager big a big Loud, angry sounding :    \"YOU MUST HAVE RESERVATIONS\"  My partner gave the name of the reservation to which we were told :   \"YOUR RESERVATION IS FOR 3!\" (it was not - it was indeed for 2 guests as my email confirmation confirmed)   To which he replied grumpily :   \"WE WILL HAVE TO GET A TABLE FOR YOU READY NOW\".   At this stage we already felt our custom unwanted.   We were then led to our table. I presume it is not used for seating guests outside of Licious and it was next to 2 average sized tables and was against the downstairs banister. The table was in the way of the guests and servers passing by. It was so small that our knees were touching under.. (I'm 5 foot 2' - not exactly long legged!)   The draft in the room was quite bad as we were sat close to the door.   I ordered the Caesar salad to start... It arrived and was just a bowl of dry lettuce - no dressing/Croutons/bacon bits.. NOTHING.. I rubbed the bottom of the dish it was served in the see if the dressing had dripped down, it to was bone dry. I asked my server for dressing, This did take 6 mins to arrive.     Next our mains arrived,  My steak was almost rare(the same as my partners).. not medium, well as i had ordered. I asked the server would it be possible to get it cooked longer , it took 11 mins to come back.. almost the same color, the potato and veg were wilted and almost inedible at that stage. The Steak was also very fatty - Please find photo below.   I was very much looking forward to the advertised Belgian Dark Chocolate Mousse Cake - This was not on offer however on the night - Disappointing!   I was half way through my sorbet when the bill was put on our table without us asking..   We felt very rushed.     The whole experience made us feel we were not being recognized as valued guests and as if we had wasted our hard earned cash.   I emailed my concerns to the Manager. 11 days Later I received a reply which told me that :  \"We have been serving \"Fred's Caesar Salad\" without bacon and croutons for many years. Many of our customers wanted a gluten free and meat free salad. I apologize that on this busy evening, it took andrew (your server) longer than normal to get you additional salad dressing.      We take great pride in the quality of beef that we served. The Omaha \"Reserve Angus\" Prime Rib of beef is very flavourful and it is also well marbled. I believe that Andrew replaced your cooked medium prime rib with your requested medium well prime rib promptly. I also confirmed with him that he provided a food quality check after.    Fred\"s Noy Here has been in business for 25 years. We have always prided ourselves on providing great quality food and service.\"   Well.. That really does not make me feel better - Pretty much telling me that I am wrong and that because my opinion is different to yours that I am wrong.. I won't be returning.."}
{"text":"Terrible slow service with little care or attention compounds bland and poor quality food an the worst Caesar I've ever had. Oh, and they don't carry any premium alcohols."}
{"text":"Quite romantic place in the Entertainment District with great meal options to choose from. The restaurant has a $29.99 2 course meal special which I think it quite a great deal. There are a number of appetizers and main courses to choose from, so there is something for everyone. I recommend getting their lobster and crab soup as the appetizer and looks like it is the go to choice amongst Yelpers as well. The puff like pastry on the top of the bowl is my favourite part of the soup and definitely one of the best I have had in town! For the main course I had their Black Pepper Salmon and my friend had the steak with frites. Both were great dishes and the portion for the steak entree was especially generous as well as we had lots of frites left over.  The server brought over a basket of bread right from the start which was great since we were both very hungry. One thing I thought they could improve on was keeping the bread and butter warm, as it was quite cold and hard. Service was great and the food came quite quickly which was a plus.   Overall, I would recommend this restaurant for a date night out."}
{"text":"I came for winterlicous. I've always wanted to come here for so long!  The Lobster and Crab soup - tasteless. There was no lobster or crab in my soup! and the soup it self was like a floury brownish consistency that had a seafood flavour.   The Steak and Frites - Fries were very delicious. The steak was bland, completely bland!! I also felt like my steak was dry, (I get a medium rare)  Dessert - A cheesecake which I could barely see on my plate, it was a really tiny piece of cheesecake. Was nice and I wanted to really enjoy it but one bite and it was gone!  Drinks - Too expensive and not worth it. It's 8 bucks for a pint of beer and the ambiance doesn't justify so high a cost. It's just red walls and a chandelier.   Service - Seems incredibly rushed. Server was nice but just seemed really rushed and haphazard.   Final thoughts: I would not come back here and I asked my friends and they said they would not come back here either. It wasn't anything in particular about the restaurant, just the food is pretty bland and tasteless, drinks too pricey. We wouldn't really enjoy our selves if we did come back."}
{"text":"server was great. food was okay  but the restaurant felt cheap like they didnt use correct white wine glasses and the fabric on chairs seamed a little worn in.   So the price of food was not up to par."}
{"text":"I was here for Summerlicious, a couple of years ago. It was booming with chatter and very crowded. If people fuels your energy, this place is for you. Their waiters were friendly and jovial. The food was super filling and I don't think I was able to finish it all by myself. The restaurant is located at a nice spot, so that in the summer you can just take a stroll (or frolic) after eating."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Toronto! Be sure to try their lobster & crab soup!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is warming and invigorating. I came here for winterlicious a month ago and truly enjoyed the lobster and crab bisque. it's puffy pastry top was a pleasure to uncover as it was to taste. I really liked their filet mignon steak. it was shaped in a striploin fashion, though much thinner, but the quality of the steak was tender and flavorful down to the last bite.   Anything other than these two dishes I wouldn't recommend (particularly the Lobster Fettucinne). It's a romanticly set restaurant with a few good dishes. Stick with what you know, or at least, what you know now."}
{"text":"I came here for a Saturday lunch for Winterlicious with a friend, and we were pretty pleased with the meal and experience! To start, we were a little early for our reservation, yet they still were able to accommodate (it wasn't too busy - around 70% full) which was great.   We both ordered the lobster soup for the appetizer which was delicious! I really enjoyed the puff pastry on top with the flavorful soup - it was also the perfect amount to start off the meal, not too heavy but enough to satisfy. Highly recommend! For the entree, I had the steak and angel hair pasta with marinara sauce which was cooked to my perfect medium and was super filling. My friend had the blue cheese burger which she also enjoyed as well. For dessert, the portions are a little smaller than the usual slice of cake, but it was a perfect amount for us since we really really stuffed by then. I had the chocolate almond torte which was more of a chocolate cake with caramel filling (which was still delicious - but just a heads up if anyone doesn't like caramel in their cakes) and my friend had the apple crumble cheesecake which was yummy as well, not too sweet or heavy.   Overall, I had a great experience here and would definitely recommend to try for Winterlicious. The restaurant itself was clean and the staff were attentive (wouldn't really say friendly, but I mean they did their job and refilled water twice and were pleasant so nothing to complain about here). A 3-course meal lunch for $23 that has so many options is a yes in my books!"}
{"text":"Very interesting experience. Food was great, everything else was a s**t show.    Very poor service - from seating to waitstaff: slow, unresponsive, and clueless. Ordered a vodka rocks with a lemon twist -pretty standard. Was brought the vodka with wedges of both lime and lemon since \"I forgot what you asked for.\"  Really?  A lemon wedge? (OK, it's Canada, so I'll give them a little slack.)   My daughter likes to draw and she asked the hostess if she had a pen. The hostess - who did seem to be trying - said, \"give me a few minutes\" and she did produce a pen. She then told my daughter that she would need it back soon. So after a couple of minutes of drawing, she said she needed it back. Ok, not a problem. But do you mean to tell me this is the ONLY pen in the entire establishment? It seemed to be, as the request from our server produces a crayon. Yes, a crayon. Wow.  Server was overmatched, though it didn't seem to be all that busy.    The NY Strip was cooked perfectly, though we asked for steak sauce, it was never brought. The wedge salad was very weak - traditionally with blue cheese dressing , not a peppercorn (but to my bad, I should have noticed it). The lobster/shrimp soup was outstanding and the kobe burger was also first rate.   Overall, great food; poor service. And the atmo was odd - lots of crying children; granted, not something the folks at Fred's could control, but maybe the little ones were wailing due to the lack of crayons (since my daughter seemed to have the only extra writing implement at the establishment)."}
{"text":"came here with girlfriends and was seriously disappointed. not only in the food but the horrible service. first of all, the place was hardly packed so i am confused about the slow service. it appeared that only two people were working and both looked like they were having the worst day of their lives- unfriendly, slow and generally uninterested. we opted for the $25 2 course meal with a drink. while the drinks were nothing special, we were hoping that the food would be much better considering the menu description was relatively tantalizing.   our appetizers were small and i could have swore i had seen (&eaten) the exact same samosas from evergreen health food store on roncesvalles. there was absolutely no difference in taste & appearance. my girlfriend ordered some dumplings (3 of them) that were tiny, greasy and came with a hot sauce that was not mentioned on the menu. through-out our meal the waitress barely visited us, never refilled our water (despite empty glasses) and didn't bother asking us if we wanted more drinks (the bartender had to serve us originally because she was nowhere to be found). actually, the whole night she was nowhere to be seen except only occasionally popping out from the back looking miserable. the atmosphere sucked, no music, you could hear everyones conversation, bartender shooting us evil looks, waitress gone, etc. even our main course was disappointing- over-cooked meat, sub par pasta, my gf found a HAIR in hers (nasty) and bland seasoning.   what a disappointment, won't return here again."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicous with my hubby, have to reserve 3 weeks ahead as restaurant is very packed. Food price $$ reasonable. Nice place for social gathering."}
{"text":"Since me and my boyfriend had a good experience here on valentines day we figured why not try it out for summerlicious. We both ordered the same thing, lobster and crab soup which was delicious as always, however that's where the good stopped. We got the beef two ways steak and brisket with baked Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was dryyyyyyyyy, like for real it tasted like uncooked pasta - gross. The beef was half way decent my steak was good (even though mine originally was mixed up with my spouse's), but he said his was quite chewy. The brisket was overly salty and dry. My boyfriend was full so he took his dessert to go, chocolate almond cake, which I just opened and is the most pathetic excuse for a piece of cake I've ever seen. It was half a sliver. I got the peach Melba which really isn't as exotic as it sounds, it's peaches, raspberry sauce and vanilla ice cream. Boringggg. For $101 taxes and tip included I feel kind of ripped off. The meal sucked and I've paid less and had a better experience ordering off the regular menu on a normal day. I may think twice before going here again."}
{"text":"The lobster and crab soup was good, but I came here to see if the steak was any good. It was not that special and I was disappointed. The steak could have been aged better, there wasn't much flavour."}
{"text":"We came for a Summerlicious  lunch yesterday on very hot day! That the restaurant was nice and cool that is best we could say about the fare offered up here. We both had crab and lobster soup. It was well presented and flavourful but alas there were none of those little pieces of shellfish we all have grown to love. My wife had the Honest Ed's roast beef and mashed potatoes. It Dejas Vu All Over Again. 30 years. That meal was why we started coming to Fred's Not Here. We thought they could improve on Ed's main menu item. No such luck! I had grilled Baby Back Ribs which tasted baked and dry. There was an awesome corn and black bean salad or salsa flavoured with chipotle and cumin. We come to restaurants to eat meals that we can't do at home. We have done way better at home and would never serve food this poorly prepared to our guests."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times (lunch and dinner).  Both times were amazing.  Great food and service was phenomenal."}
{"text":"This place was a bit weird to me. The menu seemed a little all over the place, although the food was decent enough. It was a little overpriced for what it was but given the location and the crowds it serves I guess it makes sense. I had the duck with mushroom risotto. Both were good although the duck was a little over cooked. Also had the wedge salad to start - it was tasty with an unexpected spicy kick.  The service was so so and the decor was very strange. It was also really dark (as in, what are you hiding dark). I am not sure if its meant to be a date spot or small groups of people or what. Actually, it seemed to have a bit if an identity crisis in general. Also, wash-rooms are way down stairs which is a bit annoying.  I have a couple of friends that sear by this place so maybe I was there at an off time, or they just have had a better experience. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't spectacular either."}
{"text":"The last time I was at Fred's Not Here was about 10 years ago for Wintericious. When Winterliciois first started (maybe the 2nd year). I remember the staff or dealing with the volume of Winterlicious very well. I don't remember the food, but the service wasn't good. That said, I decided to try again anyway.  So the meal starter with our waitress over pouring our water. Then when taking my order, I asked what was the most popular dish within the Summerlicious menu. I received the response, \"we put together this menu just for these 2 weeks\" and seemed baffled. Then I choose the steak. Then I said \"rare\" for how I wanted my steak. The waitress said \"rare?\" But with a bit of a different tone. So I changed my steak to medium rare. Then she was like \"you have to choice one\". Which is true but I changed my order since her tone changed. Also for certain steaks, maybe the kitchen can only do medium rare? It's sad to say that my opinion of the service here hasn't really changed. I mean this place has been doing Summerlicious/Winterlicious for over 10 years now. We were also one of the first tables on a Wednesday lunch at 11:45.   Anyway, the lobster and crap bisque was the best. I enjoyed the flavour and the pastry at the top. The rest of the dishes were okay. After my lunch, I felt like I could still taste the soup, so that really made the meal. My steak seemed to be more on the side of medium than medium rare. I let that slide since I could tell my waitress was trying to be friendly but we've had a rough start, so I didn't bother to complain. Lunch was $23."}
{"text":"Had the Ceasar Salad and Steak - bad idea. Overpriced and poor quality.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Great service and a great meal! The service was quick as well as we had tickets to a show. Great restaurant if you are planning to have dinner prior to a show in the Entertainment District."}
{"text":"I came here with my girl friend for lunch and found the restaurant to be underwhelming. My main course was a calamari dish that found to be mostly flavorless and of a poor texture (too rubbery, even for calamari). On the opposite end, my girlfriends dish was very flavorful (I am forgetting exactly what she had but remember that it was a fish).  The bread was cold but tasteful and I really like that they give several types of bread. The service was slow and seemed distracted with our waiter disappearing for part of the meal.  Overall I feel the restaurant is over priced for what you get. I could and would overlook the issues if this were a $$ restaurant but as it is I expected more for the price."}
{"text":"In general, expensive GIVEN the food quality and quality of ingredients. (Operative phrase being \"given the food quality\") But then no one ever went broke underestimating the taste and tolerance of the mass theatre going public and tipsy Blue Jays fans.  Here's my note to Fred's: My family had dinner at Fred's Not Here last night. I know that these days everyone is a critic, but in your business as in mine (travel) it's the squeaky wheel that is the most valuable. I have a couple of comments on my meal  1. Normally, if I understand correctly, restaurants aim for a cost of ingredients target of about 30-35% of menu price.  The sprinkling of \"feta\" flakes that adorned my tomato with \"feta\" salad was so faint that it could have been mistaken for salt. I could not discern even $1.00 of food costs. Which means the $8 menu price is outrageous.   Now, I do not mind pay $8 or more for a salad, but I would expect serious chunks, or even a hefty slab, of good quality Greek feta.   Furthermore, the dressing tasted no more interesting than something I could find in a bottle or at a grocery store salad bar line.  How about trying instead something simple: some excellent EV Olive oil, fresh lemon juice, a bit of thyme and S&P, and you're done.  2. There was a joke in my family that my father could carve a roast of beef so thinly that the slices were one-sided. I was reminded of this joke one the first bite of my 6-hour brisket. The slivers of brisket were so fine as to be almost ridiculous. I found the sauce gloppy, salty and unappealing. I would rather it be served naked. The risotto I also found overly salty. The dish would have benefited both in terms of look and taste from a dash of some vegetable. Are three asparagus spears or some nicely prepared spinach too much to ask?  I would encourage you to review at least these dishes and consider upping your game.  PS. though I should add that the duck confit that two other diners had looked quite appetizing. though again, a dash of veg wouldn't kill ya."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of the entertainment district, Fred's Not Here is a small restaurant whose food will continue to keep it a favourite of mine.  One word: paella. The seafood dish is amazing. They bring you the pan that it was cooked in, and it practically took up my side of the two person table. With a hefty lobster placed right in the middle, just a waft of the dish made me swoon with delight. Rich, savoury and plenty for leftovers, this dish is a must try.   The place is dim-lit, and seems to veer people toward more intimate conversations. The service is around average, but the food I've tried is great.   Worth a trip just for the paella.  More on my blog here - http://savourthethought.blogspot.ca/2013/01/take-in-take-out-freds-not-here-toronto.html"}
{"text":"Food was well portioned and very nicely prepared.  The atmosphere was perfectly lit and friendly.  The only problem I had was our waitress was a bit slow on the uptake in terms of service, like a 6/10.  She wasn't rude, just...slow."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place because of the creative name, and boy were we happy. The crab and lobster baked soup was amazing. The flavors exploded from the soup and it was truly sensational.   I had the duck and my boyfriend ordered the steak. The duck was properly cooked but the sides could have been better. I ended up pairing a lot of my meal with the mashed potatoes that my boyfriend got. My boyfriend enjoyed his steak. He said that it was seasoned nicely and cooked great.   Overall, we were very satisfied with our meal. However, it was a cold rainy day and the interior of the restaurant was much too dark. The darkness paired with the food, really made us want to take a nap.  We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went for summerlicious n food was very good, service was fabulous. Would recommend for sure. Had the lobster bisque / steak/ gelato n all were fantastic."}
{"text":"Tried the 2 course lunch. Ordered samosa for appetizer and the steak for entree. Meal was under 20 CAD which so cheap for the generous portions.  The restaurant is a little run down but food was great. I will return on my future visits to Toronto."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times. I can't remember any of the mains I've had here, which is telling, but I always get the lobster and crab soup and it's always amazing. The mix of the rich soup and puff pastry makes it stand out for me. And the baked banana chocolate bread pudding with warm caramel rum sauce is also very good. The aforementioned soup alone is worth trying out. Go for Summerlicious or Winterlicious."}
{"text":"This restaurant has terrible food and is overpriced.  Only stayed open so long as it is right across from the theatre district and people are tricked into eating there.  They have no concept of their space in the neighborhood and it is well past time they shut up shop and are replaced with a more Toronto restaurant.  There are so many more restaurants in this city that you shouldn't waste tour money here"}
{"text":"I was told that this place is quite good but it turns out to be average only. I came here for winterlicious and did not find my food exceptional for sure. I especially didn't like my steak. It was mainly fatty and certain sections were overcooked (I had it.medium well). I did like my dessert the tiramisu. The soup was also not that good in my opinion, it was mainly salty I didn't taste much more else. There service was pretty good. I came early and was seated first. For the high price you pay for good service but don't expect high returns for the food. I do think the portions were good though. In some restaurants they serve way too little portions for winterlicious."}
{"text":"First of all, since one of my given names is Frederic, it's now official: Fred's Here! Alas, they have not changed the name after my visit but they deserve 5 stars nevertheless. Why? Because if you treat your customers that well and give them so much choice during a festival like Summerlicious, where your price point is ridiculously lower than normal, then what can it be on a regular night? Do they massage you as well?  I had been to The Red Tomato a few times before and enjoyed it immensely. That is why I decided to give the upper room a try. The Summerlicious menu had great options at lunch ($20).  My friend had the cucumber, tomato and feta salad, a nice and refreshing twist on the classic Greek horiatiki, followed by steak frites and the shortcake as dessert. The steak frites was actually quite good. Beef is one of Fred's forte as he is a master of the grill. Steak came medium rare as requested, and the frites were crisp and satisfying. Shortcake was quite good too.  For myself I ordered the original quinoa and asparagus salad, which also had tomato. It was refreshing, well-seasoned and a tad lemony. Now my main was the pork belly, clams and chorizo platter. It reminded me of the Portuguese dish carne alentajana, because of the combination of pork and clams. However, this was pork belly, similar a bit in texture and taste to Chinese BBQ Pork. The clams were tasty, but the inclusion of chorizo and Israeli couscous made me fall in love with this dish.Truly spectacular! My dessert was a chocolate cheesecake which was quite good. I am not sure though if the desserts are made in house but they are good. The only alcohol had was a Vesper Martini ($10) and i really enjoyed this mix of vodka, gin, lillet and bitters. I felt like James Bond sipping this drink. Warning: a few of these may leave you shaken and stirred...  Our server was Jackie, not only competent, efficient and knowledgeable but also witty and charming. Overall, Fred's not here is a great restaurant. And just like James Bond, Fred will be back!"}
{"text":"Mixed reviews about this place. Food can be a hit or miss here, so careful what you order! The lobster and crab soup is really great, comes with some warm bread baked on top of the plate. The soup doesn't have chunky pieces of lobster or crab or anything. The meats largely just in the broth. But don't be fooled by that last sentence, you can taste the lobster and crab in every spoonful. Really yummy! The paella was less than mediocre; the mussels and lobster weren't as meaty. I've tried better paella that's for sure!   The ambience is really nice and the waiter was extremely pleasant. I just feel like there's better restaurants in the area you can go to. I would only come back here for that soup. And maybe to have a few glasses of wine."}
{"text":"Came here for their summerlicious menu ($38 dinner)! I made a last-minute reservation online, which was definitely a necessity as the restaurant was packed!   Overall, the service was good in the beginning when the restaurant was empty (our reservation was for 5:45 since it was last minute). However, when the restaurant got busy we were very neglected by our waiter. It was difficult to get his attention just to fill our water. And after we finished our entrees, it took him like 30+ minutes to clear our plates, and then another 15-20 minutes for our desserts... By the time we got the desserts I was getting kind of restless from just sitting there and waiting (a 45-50 minute wait for dessert???).   Now onto the food! For the appetizer, I ordered the lobster crab soup, which comes covered with a fluffy pastry. The soup is delicious, note that there are no actual lobster or crab pieces- which was a disappointment. That would definitely elevate the dish. I loved the pastry part! It was just the right texture to dip into the soup :)  For the entrée, I ordered the steak & frites. The steak was cooked exactly how I asked it, which kept me satisfied. The fries were good too, I like how they're so tiny! I also tried my partner's entrée, where he got the Moroccan spiced rack of lamb which came with a side of couscous. TBH, I liked the steak & frites a lot more, but maybe that's because I wasn't a huge fan of the couscous. The couscous was a little too plain..  For the dessert, we got the grilled local peach with maple syrup, vanilla ice cream and chopped pecans, as well as the apple caramel cheesecake. The grilled peach dessert was a nice change to the typical cheesecake/chocolate cake type desserts. But I still liked the apple caramel cheesecake more. Tasted like apple pie!"}
{"text":"I came here for winterlicious about a week ago with my family. Getting to the restaurant was fairly easy and we were promptly seated. The only complaint I could have about the restaurant was that the washrooms were freezing for some reason, but I'm here to talk about the food.   Famous Baked Lobster and Crab Soup: the souffle was a little thick and doughy, somebody's came deflated. The soup itself was good, though some could debate it was a little spicy. I actually liked the soup, but could have done without the doughy cover.   Slow Roasted Black Angus Prime Rib of Beef Au Jus, Vegetables & Mashed Potatoes: I was surprised when the server mentioned the dish being 8-10oz as that's a fairly large portion for a winterlicious dish. I ordered it medium rare, which it came out as so. The prime rib was good, very soft and the jus was very flavourful. The mashed potatoes were seasoned well, didn't come out bland compared to my other experiences. Overall, it satisfied my carnivorous cravings for that day.   Daily Fresh Fruit Ice: the flavours were mango and chocolate. The mango was absolutely delicious. It was a nice light ending to what could be described as a heavy meal. The chocolate was light, though I wasn't fond of the texture with the flavour. This dish was executed nicely (and it was probably just me being unfamiliar with chocolate as a sorbet)."}
{"text":"Got the lobster bisque which was delicious. The main was nothing to write home about so I won't.   Server was good and friendly.   Don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Had a great time at this tucked away gem.  I'd never been here before but my dining partner had ten years ago.    We arrived at about 5:25 on a Sunday after our event across the street, there were maybe like 10 customers in there.  We like going when things aren't busy so this was perfect.  We sat inside upstairs and it was a nice temperature (which I never mention because usually I'm either too cold or my best friend is too hot and that's not a really fair thing to write about lol... but we had this glorious goldilocks moment).  We were promptly waited on and they served us complimentary cornbread so that won us over right away.    We never go out and eat the way of the theatres because I have this preconceived notion that theatre district food is overpriced and overhyped.  This place was at a fair price and the meal was splendid and flavourful.  We had seafood and salads and flourless almond cake for dessert... I had the seafood caesar bowl... I am definitely going back again for that.  It's very American.  I love American food... like portions are large and they go all out.  This place made that dream come true without even knowing I had that dream.  I always expect a tiny sprinkle of salad but this was a delicious, carefully adorned, full bowl   I had a great experience there with fantastic waitstaff.  Super friendly, helpful, and I caught some of their interactions together in passing that were very kind and they have a good repertoire with one another... When people work well together there's a kind of atmosphere that you can only get when that happens.  My business partner and I were having a light discussion about things we are working on and we kept interrupting ourselves talking about how much we were enjoying ourselves.    Will be back here again, sooner than later."}
{"text":"Food is excellent...location great if going to a show downtown...nice wait staff...I wouldn't make a special trip...but if you need to find a place to eat in the theater district...this is as good a choice as any."}
{"text":"What a strange hang. I walked into restaurant with only two tables and nobody visible to help me. I sat down and could see some kitchen help that knew I was there, and still waited and waited and waited for somebody to come out. When somebody finally did come out I was able to order beer and ask for a menu. The girl seemed surprised that I was going to order food and it wasn't that late. It was 8:30 p.m. and there was still two tables in there. But oddly enough I barely saw her all night long. I ordered the steak and the steak was amazing and all of my three stars are because the steak was really good. What was lame was the side of green beans that were barely steamed almost raw. With absolutely no flavor no seasoning whatsoever. And it will serve for fries and the fries were good. I had that lobster crab bisque soup that was interesting but I don't know why it get such high rating cuz I didn't think it was that good. My meal was basically a really good steak and a really good beer. The cost was pretty enormous for how lame everything had been. I felt like the service was really under par and the meal was not thought out. When I was first ordering I was pushed towards a two-course option. And then as I was ordering she asked me if I wanted an appetizer and I had already forgotten that it was included and said I'm fine. Then I realized I think I'm paying for an appetizer and that's when I added the soup. Overall I felt like it was very lame. Comes to the end of the night and the last table in the place and her back is to me for the longest period of Time full day napkins, I don't know what she was doing. All I know is I had to get up and walk over and ask her to bring me out. I was the only person in the place it wasn't that hard. I question whether it should be a two store review but the steak was really good."}
{"text":"omg great service, food was meh ... we went here before we went to the musical cats ... I would probably eat here again"}
{"text":"I visited for their SummerLicious Dinner menu and I was impressed with the amount of food as well as the quality. I went with a friend and we had: the lobster and crab soup (amazing), gnocchi with walnut parsley basil (extremely filling and very good), the 12 (or 14 oz, I can't remember) new york strip, peach melba and almond cake. Everything was cooked perfectly to order and we appreciated the great attentive service. Hope to visit again soon."}
{"text":"In all fairness this could be a 2 star review, but I was REALLY put off by Fred's Not Here. This restaurant relies on its location across the street from the Princess of Whales and Royal Alex theatres, rather than quality food and excellent service.   The food sucked. My shrimp cocktail had 3 shrimp that had seen fresher days. My mother's scallops were like rubber. I had the tuna, specified I wanted it SEARED, and it was brought to me cooked medium rare.  I question the attentiveness of the sever.  I sent the tuna back and they made me a new one, and it was okay.  Our server was short with us and rude. She gave off a strong vibe that said: \"I'd rather be somewhere else.\" Maybe she was having a bad day...   Fred's Not Here has a very touristy vibe. I advise the tourists, or anybody, reading this review, to go somewhere else. There are much better places to dine in Toronto's theatre district."}
{"text":"Went to this place about a year ago and was not all that impressed overall. The service was just OK, the price was quite high for what you were getting and nobody was all that impressed with the food. The lobster and crab soup they boast was OK but not great, not sure I would come back here myself. There are just too many places I know that are better for me to want to go here again.  I would recommend searching out a different place in the area if you are looking for a good meal."}
{"text":"I'm a little embarrassed because I ordered 3 of their lobster/crab bisque soup one night. I just couldn't stop drinking them because it tasted so good! I could taste the sweetness of the crab, it actually tasted real unlike other places. The texture was creamy and gravy-like. It had this baked pastry on top. Outside was dry and crusted, in side was soft and doughy, what a tasty combo.  The soup was served in a fancy cup-like bowl that was baked. The soup was very hot and toasty. This is exactly  what lobster/crab bisque should taste like.  BUT however my 3rd order of lobster bisque came in a different consistency. It was more watery than creamy. A bit disappointed in that.   I tried their steak menu that came with angel hair pasta on the side. I liked the pasta, but the steak could be juicer and more tasty. If only they put more salt on it, then it should be better."}
{"text":"We went here for for summerlicious for my bday. I work close by here but never tried it but saw it whenever i walked by.  We sat down and were given water pretty quick. However, it took way too long for us to place our order. We wouldn't even have been served if one of my friends didn't go up and ask.  The summerlicious deal was a 3 course meal. I ordered a caesar salad, prime rib and an ice cream sundae. The food was average...nothing really amazed me. There was an 18% gratuity added because of our party of 17 which resulted in pretty expensive bills of close to $50 per person."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and the food was quite good. The service was excellent as there were only 8 people in the restaurant on a friday night. The atmosphere was dark and old, the menu's looks like it came from a photocopier from the 1980's which they are still using today.  Lots of menu options and pretty good value for the price. The butter was the size of a slice of bread but you can't fault them for being generous. They had this homemade cornbread that was pretty good, I jus wished the bread was warm and not cold. Overall not bad and not really sure why fred's not there.   The food:  pork short ribs: the ribs were actually very delicious and flavorful. The salad was quite good but the popcorn was a little stale.  Lambchops: Pretty good overall, jus a tad bit too salty.  Scallops and rice: The scallops were really good but the rice was just ok."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last evening and was required to pick up something to eat after leaving. Had the mussels and lobster tails, big mistake, the lobster was chewy and flavourless. The six mussel portion was unremarkable. Angel hair pasta was clumpy and crunchy in turn. Even the bread was dry and butter came in little plastic packets that you opened yourself. One of the worst meals I have ever had in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious with a friend based on a foodie's recommendation. Slightly disappointed.  Ordered the Shrimp & Lobster bisque as an app, which was really the highlight of the entire meal - unfortunate because it was only downhill from there. Also, didn't find any actual seafood in the bisque - not sure if that's how it's always served or not, but it had a nice kick to it and a beautiful consistency. The dough on top of the pot was deeeelicious.  For the main I ordered pork 2 ways. I was looking forward to trying the not-steak item on the menu even though I heard their steaks were great (though NOT \"melt in your mouth\" according to my friend), but was kind of disappointed. It was pork belly and pork ribs with some coleslaw, beans & fries. For lunch, the portion was GIGANTIC, but the quality was so-so. The sauce on the pork tasted like it came from a mid-range Chinese restaurant, and the beans didn't have anything special. The pork belly was yummy, but the ribs were lukewarm and had no kick to them, though they were soft. It felt like somebody forgot about the entree.  For dessert, ordered the mixed shortcake. Tasted good, but nothing innovative or special.  All in all, kind of disappointed."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here for Winterlicious last night. It is by far one of the best value restaurants on the list. The baked lobster and crab soup are a definite must with the buttery flaky crust. Of all the entrees, the surf n turf I would say looked the best and everyone's steaks were cooked perfectly. I will definitely be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious with a group of 8.  I've heard good things about this place from friends and man oh man I don't know what happened. The service from start to end was poor. I looked at every server and cooks in the back and everyone looked miserable. Our server seemed like they had a rough day.  Got the crab and lobster soup and it was salty. The main course surf and turf with fries was decent. You get what you pay for I guess for winterlicious.  Maybe things will be different the next time I come by."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious with my cousins and my cousins' girlfriend.  The place was easy to find but we had to wait to be seated.  When we were finally greeted, we were greeted by an asian gentleman whom was really rude and unprofessional.  Once we sat down, it took us a while to finally have the waiter approach us, which at that time we ordered our food and drinks together since we did not know when he was going to come back.  I was looking for the washroom and came across the rude asian gentleman and asked where the washroom was. He did not even look at me while talking to me and directed me downstairs (which is another restaurant/bar).  The food was meh.. I ordered the baked lobster & crab soup which was amazing! But then I got the wood-grilled \"california cut\" new york strip steak with sautéed garlic mushrooms with duck fat frites, which was just average.. tasted a little burnt and not flavourful.  And finally finished with the new-york style cheesecake, which we were all ooh-ing and ahh-ing over, only to find that the new-york style cheesecake didn't come with the tastiest part.. THE GRAHAM CRACKER CRUST. We were all disappointed.  One of my cousins' ordered the caramel popcorn chocolate hazelnut sundae, to be different and because he doesn't like cheesecake and he was disappointed as well. It was pretty much chocolate ice cream that tasted like what you could get out of the grocery store and had a drizzle of chocolate sundae sauce with stale caramel popcorn pieces on top of the ice cream.. Overall the service and experience was horrible, if anything I'd come back to get the baked lobster & crab soup to go and that's about it."}
{"text":"It was ... sort of okay. The service was \"doing their duty\" and nothing more. There are two restaurants here: \"Fred's not here\" and \"The red tomato\". When I came in I asked the waiter which is the Fred's and he just laughed and went away. Okay, there were two big signs that I had overlooked. My fault. But even if so, it was sort of u professional and rude.  The all so famous crab soup was a tad too spicy leaving few room for the crab taste. And the \"Canadian Prime N.Y. Strip Steak (16 oz.) with Duck Fat Frites & Vegetables\"? Well, the vegetables were a few long green beans. The Duck Fat Frites were just disgusting - I could not eat them. Tasted like fried in many-days-old fat. And the steak? Well ... it was okay. Nothing special. Not bad, but also not good. So, could at least a nice presentation save what could be saved? Unfortunately not. It was presented without any love looking like done by someone who doesn't enjoy his job.  Do, no, I cannot follow all the positive recommendations. My general experience of \"avoid restaurants where they have paper table cloths\" just proofed to be true again.  By the way, the restaurant was relatively empty on a Sunday evening."}
{"text":"Decent place to get prix fixe lunch, and they can accommodate large groups. On all the times I have come here, the service was quick and very good.   Today I tried the calamari as the appetizer. The calamari itself was quite bland. I would not order this dish again. On other times I have come, I ordered the famous soup (I think it may have been too salty for me but I can't remember for sure) and I tried one of the salads. Looking around at the salads (kale, arugula, ceaser) at my table today, I'd say they all looked quite tasty with shaved parmesan on top.  For the main today I had the ricotta ravioli with vegetables. The raviolis are huuuuge and there is a generous amount of veggies on top. I quite enjoyed this dish and was stuffed afterwards! In the past I have gotten the blackened salmon and I recall it being good.  For dessert I got the chocolate almond cake. It tastes just as described. It is rich in chocolate almond flavours but not overly sweet. My friends got the bread pudding and really enjoyed that dessert. Maybe I'll try that one next time!"}
{"text":"Went here for summerlicious. The lobster soup was the favourite part of the meal for me :) Steak was okayish, not the best I have had. There wasn't a lot of flavour in it. For desert, i had cheesecake which was tasty. I'll probably come back for the soup, but not for anything else."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times before and they were much better experiences than the one we had tonight.  We split the coconut shrimp which was very rubbery. She had the 6oz filet and enjoyed it. I had the Cajun salmon and it was dreadful to the point I hope I can make my flight tomorrow morning.  I would have returned it but didn't want the drama tonight.  Gluten free cake was delicious.  Waiter service was pleasant but not very attentive.  Empty water glasses in an empty restaurant should never happen.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere whether you're out with the girls or a more intimate dinner for only 2. 6 of us this evening. 6 different meals. All outstanding. Food prep was perfect. We had steak, seafood, salads, soup... Not a thing we'd change about any of the items or our experience here. Andrew was a waiter and he was excellent."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick bite to eat here last week because it was late and we didn't feel like driving around downtown.  I had the Seafood Mixed Grill and it was nothing special. The bed of rice that it was served on was quite flavourful, and it was a generous serving of seafood.  The restaurant was pretty busy as there was a private function going on, so the service lacked.  I think if you want quality food before a show, you should avoid the theatre district altogether as most of the food is mediocre at best. I'm of the mindset that if the food is good, I don't mind if it's close or far from my next stop.  There are much better restaurants downtown."}
{"text":"Decided to come here as a group for Winterlicious 2016. We chose this place because the Winterlicious menu was so extensive. You can decide between 6 appetizers, 8 entrees and 4 desserts. I got the lobster and crab soup, streak and banana chocolate bread.  The app was fantastic, given it was the first thing they served. The flavour of the soup was plentiful, however, I couldn't really taste lobster in it because the spice covered up most of it. This not to say that it was bad because it was still good. Some people might not like it so peppery. There I thought the rest of the food should be good or better. Turned out it was only ok because the entree and dessert just didn't cut it. I ordered the steak medium rare, but I got it close to medium. I wasn't exactly happy about that and this happens to me quite often. The dessert... While it was good, it wasn't superb. I was hoping it be softer, but turned out harder than I thought.  The worst part of the night was not actually the food, but the asian guy working there. I'm not sure if he's the owner or just the man in charge that night. His attitude was just poor, not very friendly.. Hopefully his name isn't Fred, cuz if it is.. Well, he really shouldn't be there.  The best part of the night was our waitress. She was so polite and always came over to help us. Just a kind and warm person, not to mention absolutely stunning! Thank you so much for the night, mystery waitress! If I were to rate the person serving our table, I'd give her 5 stars straight up! So, Fred, you better give her a damn raise! Since I'm reviewing the food and my overall experience, then 3 is the best I can give."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with last night's dinner downstairs. They wouldn't admit it but they must have dumped a bottle of hot sauce in the lobster and crab soup because we couldn't taste anything except the hot sauce. It made our lips burn and thankfully they gave us a basket of bread to relieve the burning sensation. Impossible to believe this is the mild and tasty soup all of the other reviewers have written about in their reviews. The strip steak was so full of grizzle we couldn't even cut it, let alone chew it. We assume it is always that bad otherwise instead of simply not charging us for the steak meal, they would have replaced it with something else or another piece of meat. The waiter was extremely attentive and apologetic. It wasn't his fault but we felt they could have offered some other solution rather than only charging us for the other dish, which was the seafood pasta. That was very tasty. The Mirvish dinner and theatre special would have been a very good deal if the food was better. The waiter kept saying next time maybe we would have a better meal. Sorry, but there won't be a next time for us."}
{"text":"Went to this place for dinner with Co-workers. The food was great the Thai soup was spicy and excellent and the burger well let's just say the chef that wear's the black baseball cap know's exactly what he is doing.  Only thing wrong they needed to provide for French Fries than what comes with the order."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner during Winterlicious, 3 course meal for $35. The regular menu is reasonably priced  as well. The service was great, our waiter was very nice and helpful in accommodating to various food restrictions. The portions were a good size, I left the restaurant satisfied without feeling overly full and the food came out at a good pace.  I'm a huge fan of their Famous Baked Lobster & Crab Soup, the flavour was amazing and it made me feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside :) I also had their Lobster Tail served with Jalapeno pasta, which was a little on the spicy side but would be tasty if you can handle it. I couldn't eat the pasta and I expected more flavour in the lobster, so that dish was OK. Finished off with dessert, and everyone at our table thought each of their orders were overly sweet and couldn't finish it. Had a little bit of steak and scallops from other people's dishes though; they were both very tender and the flavour was not over the top - they let the meat shine through rather than masking it in a lot of sauces, rubs, etc.   I'd definitely go again and try more things on their menu. I'll stick to their meats and seafood, maybe not the pastas."}
{"text":"The menu was very moderately priced for the King West location. They had a 2 course dinner special going on, which only cost $29.99 per person. I ordered the crab and lobster bisque (additional ~$2) and a cod for main course. The food was okay (mediocre) and nothing special. A couple next to us was very loud and ruined the ambiance for us a little bit. However, even with that aside, I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"I had not been here in years and so I was going on memories.   We got there on a chilly night.   It was busy and we did not make a reservation.  We put our name down and headed downstairs to the bar.  It was packed and we found two seats.  We ordered a glass of wine from a very distracted bar tender.  We waited since they said it would only be 20 minutes.  I finally called the bar hostess over and she said she would check on us.   Our table was ready.  She told us that we need to close the tab downstairs and we had to ask the bar tender a few times.  He forgot us and didn't even remember what we had ordered.  We headed back up stairs.  There were so many empty tables.  I was starving.  The food was good but the service was just insane ..."}
{"text":"Came here for a group lunch, and most people had the lunch prix fix menu. Because I'm allergic to crustaceans, I was not able to try the crab and lobster bisque. I ordered a salad and the steak - salad was average, and steak portion was very disappointing. It was also overcooked (I ordered medium rare and it was closer to medium well). Definitely would not recommend the steak. Maybe the seafood would be better."}
{"text":"Let Summerlicious 2012 begin!  Over all the meal was ok. I started off with the Cesar Salad. It was very garlicy, which I enjoy, however some in my party didn't.   I than had the filet mignon, which was suppose to come with mushroom risotto however, I am picky and don't like mushrooms, so they swapped it out for the Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes, which were just meh. They had a little bit of a weird taste to them. Also, I like my steak cooked well done, however they under cooked it. So that was upsetting.  For desert I had the chocolate mouse cake, which was nice. I ordered one of their drinks, a jolly rancher and it was close to $10 bucks and not good. So for the undercooked steak and the expensive (and not that tasty) drink I give it 3 stars.  Our waitress was very nice too!"}
{"text":"Friends in Toronto recommended Fred's and we were happy they did. The food was straight-ahead fresh, well-prepared and delicious.  I started with the simple arugula salad which is how it sounds -- light and green and tasty; my husband enjoyed a caesar.  The trout, not normally a personal fave, was prepared perfectly, a light dish, punctuated with a tiger shrimp.  My husband was not as happy with the surf and turf: the surf (lobster) was dry and tasteless, although the turf (steak) was well prepared.  In an unusual move, we ordered dessert: creme brulee, which was a good finale.    Enjoyed the Canadian wine as well!  Service was fine,  ambience quiet, tables nicely spaced.  Note: don't go before the theatre crowd finishes up.  Our 7:30 reservations were perfect.  Only wrinkle was discovering an extra glass of wine on the bill, and not what we were drinking, which seemed strange; the waiter reimbursed us with cash."}
{"text":"I went to Fred's Not Here on Friday, July 17, 2009 for a Summerlicious Dinner with my friends, and I had a really good time.  I ordered the famous baked lobster & crab soup as an appetizer, the ribeye steak with yam fries as the entree, and the mixed berry shortcake as the dessert.  The famous baked lobster & crab soup came out first and I was pleasantly surprised. It was creamy and rich, and tasted divine. Like I said when I was eating it, it's like a party and my mouth and I don't want anyone else to be there. The pastry that initially covered the bowl added a great texture to the soup that I thoroughly enjoyed.  The ribeye steak with yam fries came out next, and I was VERY surprised because of the huge portions it came out in. My steak was done perfectly, and the fries had two onion rings on top, and it was just one of the heartiest meals I have ever eaten. Definitely no complaints from me.  The mixed berry shortcake came out next, and when tasting the chocolate mousse my friend ordered, I was very pleased with my choice in dessert. There was a hint of sour about it because of the berries, but overall it was delicious.  Fred's Not Here had delicious food, fantastic service that kept our glasses full, and I would definitely come back during regular dining times. Well, if I had the money."}
{"text":"I see little value in writing a lot about a place like this. It was OK but nothing more.  There are so many other better places I was sorry to waste the chance for a great meal on this place.  Toronto has great restaurant choices.  This just isn't great.  It is OK."}
{"text":"Came here randomly because we liked how there was seating on the street which isn't quite common here in Toronto so we gave it a go. We were seated right away and our food came pretty fast. I forgot the exact name of my dish but it was that thin spaghetti soaked in tomato sauce and served with shrimp which was pretty average. We also got the complimentary bread and a slice of cornbread, both of which I enjoyed. The calamari was probably the nastiest I've ever had and the caprese salad was also average.   The service was pretty bad, I'm not even going to sugar coat it. Our waiter never came to check in on us once our food was served and when it came time to pay the bill, he didn't seem to pleased that we wanted to pay separately. In fact, he mentioned that we should've told him before hand because their cash register is over thirty-five years old and doesn't do split bills. Normally waiters ask if you'd like to pay together or separate BEFORE they bring the bill! Anyways, based on service alone I would've come back here.   Due to the mediocre food and crappy service, I won't be returning nor will I be recommending this restaurant to anyone in my circle."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Fred's Not here whenever the Summerlicious/Winterlicious menus are released. I was finally able to have a Summerlicious lunch here with my boyfriend last weekend. The cost for the lunch is $23 without taxes+ tip. Overall, I would have to say the experience was average.   The food was pretty good. My boyfriend got the Salad of Arugula (average) and I got the Lobster Bisque which was very tasty but nearly burned my mouth because it was scorching hot. The mains-the Blue Label Burger and Confit of Muscovy Duck with Mushroom Spinach Risotto-were absolutely fantastic. I had to remove a point from this restaurant's rating as I was extremely disappointed with the desserts-they were literally barely even two bites..SO tiny! I understand the pre-fix price is pretty low, but this restaurant really cheaped out on its desserts. Nonetheless, the desserts (Apple Caramel Cheese Cake and Chocolate Almond Cake) were still very rich and delicious.  Another downside of our experience was where we were seated. We were seated near the entrance looking outwards, completely secluded from the actual inside of the restaurant. Thus, unfortunately, we were not able to feel the complete mood and ambiance of the venue (which, needless to say, looks very nice from the pictures). Another issue was that there were FLIES that would just not leave us alone! I had to keep brushing one off our table.   The food is pretty good here and I would recommend to a friend ONLY if they can get proper seating."}
{"text":"The fusion menu between Fred's Not Here and The Red Tomato is one of the best Winterlicious I had so far. The waiter informed us their Winterlicious menu is extended until February 12, 2017. Our Famous Baked Lobster & Crab Soup truly lived up to its reputation. The flavour of the seafood was well blend into this creamy soup and the amount of black pepper they've put in really kicked a notch. For the main course, I've ordered the Grilled California Cut New York Strip Steak with Rigatoni Marinara. The steak was a bit chewy even though I've asked for medium rare. As for the pasta, I was speechless.  I've never tasted anything this amazing. As for dessert, Mango & Berry Cheesecake was nothing special."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate a family member's 27th birthday. We were pretty excited since we hadn't been to this place before and the ambiance of the place seemed pretty nice.  My husband and I ordered the coconut shrimp with thai dipping sauce.  Anything shrimp and coconut is a MUST HAVE FOR ME.  It was pretty good but nothing I'd go crazy over.    My main dish was a vegetarian dish of stuffed ravioli with butternut squash and a really rich creamy sauce topped with bits of macadamia nuts. Had I known this dish was going to be real heavy I might have passed on the appetizer.  Also the dish didn't seem like much at first, but it'll definitely fill you up. I definitely loved this dish and would recommend it to anyone, especially since i'm normally a carnivore and I hardly choose vegetarian dishes over meat, but this was well worth it. My husband chose the 6 hr beef brisket and he thought it was good but not the greatest.  Overall everyone in our party of 11 seemed to enjoy their dinner. The place is a bit pricey, so if you have that extra cash to burn and want to just try a new place then i say give it a shot."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended, and I didn't anticipate being let down when I saw the menu. I ordered from the two-course menu - 'Frank's Caesar Salad' and the 10oz NY Strip.   The salad was incredible, and, in my opinion carried the rest of the meal.   The steak was mediocre at best. It was overcooked, fatty, and served with four green beans, two slivers of braised cabbage (which were all wonderful - unfortunately the plate was nearly empty) and duck fat frites, which my dining companion pointed out tasted exactly like McDonald's fries with a bit better texture.  Dessert was underwhelming, but was quite cheap compared to the rest of the menu ($6.99 for two (albeit small) pieces of cheesecake). Today's two selections were chocolate and vanilla. Flavourless is the first word that comes to mind.   Honestly, I've never had a better caesar salad in my life - it was wonderfully spicy, intelligently perked up with some radicchio and the dressing was perfect.  I hate it when I like a place more going in than I do coming out, and this is one of those places. Unfortunately the service was slow, our waiter was creepy and aside from the salad, the food was not something I'd cross the street for. A shame really - some of the other dishes (especially the baked lobster and crab soup) looked fabulous, but I don't make habit of going to a steakhouse for the appetizers."}
{"text":"Came here again for winterlicious and after my first experience so I know what to order.   Service was spot on and friendly, the ambiance was relaxing and casual. Price was more than fair for the menu. The company and the food made it a great night, can't wait to come back again! I would say there is a bit of everything for everyone here. The food was delicious even down to their bread basket. Our waiter was super accomodating and attentive. Left the table feeling full and satisfied. They changed up their menu and we got to try some new dishes they added, the surf and turf pasta, the chicken, and their different desserts. The best banana chocolate bread pudding I've ever had hands down."}
{"text":"I rounded my rating from 3.5*.  The winterlicious menu sucked me in for sure. I saw it was a 3* place and I was a little skeptical as I usually wouldn't try to pop into 3* but this surprised me for sure. Especially that it's run by a couple of older Asian men, I thought it would have similar quality to uncle joe's, which thankfully, was not the result.  I came with three friends and we all started with the lobster and crab soup, except one got kale salad. From what I heard, the salad was very refreshing and really helped build up towards the heavy entrées. The soup was quite amazing. Just the right amount of spice to bring out the lobster and highlight the crab, but it didn't burn my throat going down. The pastry was a nice addition that definitely filled us up quite fast, but it helped balance the spicy kick. I find that usually bisques tend to be bland and I was ready to throw the whole pepper shaker in this soup, but I didn't need to. I could've had another one, that was how good it was.  For entrées, à friend and I got the three hour roasted venison with mafalda noodles in Chianti, and another friend got garlic butter Bay scallops and rice, and one got a medium rare prime rib with potatoes. The scallops were actually very sweet despite the garlic butter, but it was light, as in it wasn't heavy and didn't make us feel comatose. The venison was dry to the right extent. Some of the noodles were cut but that's okay because that's what a knife is for! This dish was def filling. Venison isn't as gamey as I thought it would be.  For desserts, we got apple crumble cheesecake, this chocolate cake thing, and bread pudding. Cheesecake was great and wasn't super sweet. Then again, I was comparing to the chocolate cake which got sweeter as you progressed to the back. Definitely not for diabetic people! My fav out of the three was the bread pudding. Warm, toasty, and actually the least sweet but with the most complex taste. I'd recommend the bread pudding.  Server was friendly and nice, joked with us about us waiting for our friend. He was totally chill. He did ask us to give our empty dishes to him instead of him taking it from us, so that was a little iffy imo but nothing to kill à star over.  Tldr : get the lobster and crab soup, entrées could be venison or scallops, and for desserts, def get the bread pudding."}
{"text":"Food sucks. Ordered the beef brisket with ricotta and steak frites. The steak tasted really bland and the beef brisket did not taste very good really heavy on the cheese and a very strong mushroom taste. It didn't go well with cheese. Got fries and the bread as well. Fries are soggy and the bread was stone cold. I assumed that they serve cold bread with butter. The service wasn't good either. We asked if they serve beer the server drop the menu to us and left without asking if we wanted any drinks. Waited quite a long time to order a drink  and our food. She didn't check if we were ok with the food or drink. Very disappointed with  this restaurant. I don't suggest anyone to go  there."}
{"text":"Alright, this was another restaurant that my mom wanted to try while she was here last week.  We opted for their $25, three-course menu and I have to say that though my mom enjoyed it, I was disappointed.  We both ordered the grouper dish with a salad appetizer and for dessert we shared a chocolate cake thing.    The salad was fresh, but nothing spectacular.  The grouper was served with over cooked vegetables (so over cooked that the colour had been drained from the vegetables and they were nothing but a soggy, mushy, oversalted mess).  The fish itself was served with a creamy spinach sauce, but the fish was undercooked and swimming in this gloppy green sauce that was definitely not appetizing to look at and the texture when eating it was a little disgusting.  I left most of my fish and the vegetables untouched.    Our server was nice, and the service itself was fast.  However, given the quaility of the food, I found that even the $25 price was too much to pay."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Good atmosphere.  Got the Mirvish dinner... Iceberg wedge salad. Blue cheese burger and gluten free cake.  Fries were a little under cooked.  Family had the steak with the pesto pasta.  They loved the steak but found the pesto sauce a little boring.  Great place to eat before theatre !!!"}
{"text":"You have to try the lobster bisque! It would be the only reason I would come here. We were put at the table right in front of the kitchen. It was loud and hard for my partner to hear me. The table had drink marks from the previous couple who were sitting there before us. When we asked to be moved somewhere else, they were a bit hesitant but moved us anyways.   Food took a while to come, but was understandable since the restaurant was packed. We had the seafood paella which was decent and ribs which were okay. The soup was delicious. It was steaming hot when they brought it to us and the puff pastry was fluffy."}
{"text":"For 2014 Summerlicious, this was my second restaurant during the event.  Their price for dinner is average, and if you are a steak lover, this is probably one of the restaurants on your \"to-visit\" list.  Went to this place with a friend, so we were able to order a few different items to try.  Baked Famous Lobster & Crab Soup Wood Grilled \"California Cut\" New York Strip Steak Roasted Prime Rib Mixed Berry Shortcake Cheesecake  The Lobster & Crab soup was very special, they had a layer of baked pastry on top which you can mix with the soup.  The soup was very spicy, but this is normal for many lobster soup to ensure the \"fish\" smell is at minimal for people who are not used to seafood smells.  Also, the baked pastry is VERY heavy, so you will be pretty much half full after consuming that.  The New York Steak, Prime Rib were okay, nothing really special, taste like steak you would get at any average chain western restaurants.  Portion was big and the sides that the New York Steak came with will for sure make you full.  Desserts was very disappointing, they tasted like they were bought from elsewhere and then served to customers.  Setting wise, I personally do not enjoy sitting in dim lighting restaurants, mainly because i get very sleepy in dim lights after a large meal, and this was definitely a large meal especially if you had the lobster soup as starter.  Overall, for budget Summerlicious consumers, this would be pretty good, but if you don't mind paying the extra $10 (45$ in total) for the higher end Summerlicious restaurants for dinner, I would recommend going to those instead.  Will I be back again? Probably not."}
{"text":"I had the salmon, my friends had a steak and my boyfriend had the chicken. . . or something like that.  I had the Salmon which was very tasty, very tasty.  My friends were raving about their meals so I had to taste it and the chicken and steak(which I never eat) were absolutely delicious.  We had the salads for apps which were salads nothing crazy.    I was so excited that this place turned out to be good because I picked this place for my friends so I was a hero that night!!  I would def go back."}
{"text":"I have to give 2.5 because of the service. Food came out quick and server was nice and fast. If it wasn't the service, I will only give 2.   There was nothing special about this place. Maybe they are really good at steak but their other dishes were good but not good enough for what you are paying ... it felt like it was higher class of pickle barrel with a good food..   There are plenty of other good places around the neighborhood. Won't go back if I have a choice."}
{"text":"Invigorating ambiance- deep red romantic murals and warm white chandeliers set the perfect mood for enjoying a special occasion- and the incredible intricately constructed menu only aids in the appreciation of the atmosphere, as trying to decide on which dish to order could take all night- the food, the wine and service were all certainly spectacular!  I especially loved the lobster and crab bisque with the dome of puff pastry, which steamed as you pierced the pastry- highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'd like to share my Winterlicious experience with everyone on here(it was not good)  So the good things here was the following: Crab soup - this soup was delicious and it's unique, so definetly get this. The raviloi Mushroom Agnolotti - smothered with a lot of oil, but this dish was delicious Banana Chocolate Bread Pudding - only desert worth getting.   The bad: This place is known for steaks and that is what they are known for as the server explained to us. This is not the case, the steaks are not good at all(at least the ones we had) Baked stuff calamari - 4 small pieces, definetly not worth it, don't even think about it The other cakes - don't get them, they are probably the size of your pinkie.  The really bad: Service was horrible. Our server dropped the desert for us and the cheque at the same time, even though we never asked for the bill just yet. We felt rushed just making the order(and that was after 5 minutes of waiting to be acknowledged). Our server(I will not mention her name) was rude and also did not help us with wine selection - which is odd, considering she would have made a better tip. Anyways, I have no idea why by default we should be giving 15 percent tip when some servers don't even deserve 5 percent. I only gave the 15 percent tip because the cooks that are working hard deserve it, but not this server. She and her coworker were also talking about the other tables and how some diners are - we overheard this because our table was closest to the kitchen / server ordering area.   This place is probably somewhere the tourists go, but Torontonians can probably find a better place to eat, but not this place please. Very disappointed with service and I will not be ever coming back here. I will also make sure that I tell everyone that this place is not worth it."}
{"text":"They got some mixed reviews but had dinner here on fri night n food was great! Our server was v attentive and overall had a great experience. Food was tasty... the pork ribs starter was flavourful, followed by the jump scallops and Moroccan lambchops which was both yummy. The bread basket had a homemade jalepeno corn bread which is def worth a mention. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I have dined here five times in the last nine months and each time I have never been disappointed. I have dined alone and then brought colleagues here as well. Can't beat the two-level, two course menu. Steaks were excellent, fish just as good, but all are surpassed by the lobster/crab soup to start the evening. A reasonable priced wine list with excellent by-the-glass selections as well. A well balanced menu with salads, appetizers and desserts. The restaurant itself is artfully decorated with a dry, twisted sense of humor. Wait staff excellent with knowledge to guide through a devine meal."}
{"text":"I really wonder where Fred is sometimes.. actually maybe it's a good thing that he's not here, otherwise I wouldn't have this great restaurant to go to!  I've been here twice and both times I've been satisfied with my meal and VERY satisfied with the service. I unfortunatley can't make a comment about my first meal as it was 2 years ago but I just came back here for Winterlicious lunch and well it was worth it.  We tried the lobster and crab soup, it was reaallyy good, especially the pastry covering the bowl (I think its philo?). The mains however were a tad dissapointing. The scallops were over cooked and rubbery a bit and the duck I had was good but I was expecting a bit more. Dessert was also very good, the apple strudel was exactly what I wanted (taste and texture) and how can you beat this for $20! (Warning: Normal prices are usually double this)  Regardless I'm guessing their slight lack in meal quality this time around was due to Winterlicious but most people I know have a great time here and enjoy their meals. I'd even go as far to say that Fred's Not Here is one of the better restaurants on this restaurant filled King street strip."}
{"text":"Excellent value on the $20 winterlicious. My second time here and the server handled our large group with ease and professionalism. Didn't mind the 18% auto added for tip.   The lobster bisque was just as good as I remembered. The steak was excellent, a nice lunch size. 10 skinny beans (?) looked a little sad next to the steak, and the fries were oily... oh well. Desserts were good, nice strong coffee. Happy."}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious lunch on a Saturday. They told us they couldn't make duck!!! That's all I went there for! Had the gumbo instead, not a fan at all. The gumbo tastes like black pepper and that's it. Had squid for app, very bland. Hubby had the lobster soup, way to salty. He also had the 2 way pork, too much fat! He had 2 pieces and spent the afternoon rushing to the bathroom. The dessert are like the ones you can get from sobeys. Not worth the price, not even the winterlicious price."}
{"text":"We loved our visit to Fred's Not Here.  The waiter was pretty funny and very friendly.  I followed the advice from one of the previous reviews and order the Rib Eye Steak.  Mmm, very good and very large.  We also order the baked lobster crab soup.  Amazing!  Big puff pastry top with soup below.  I gave this place 5 stars we loved it."}
{"text":"Was here for Winterlicious.  My steak was perfect. :) The service was a little slow but i think they were short staffed."}
{"text":"I thought this place was excellent. After having lived in NYC for 5 years I've found it difficult to find a good meal in the city. My partner and I stopped in to this place on the way to the theater. What a great find! We were seated right away although the restaurant was quite full. To start off this place served up an excellent Manhattan cocktail - very generous serving and very reasonably priced. We choose to go with the prix fixe which was excellent. The lobster and crab baked soup was fantastic and for the main course the blackened salmon with grilled prawn and artichoke risotto. Food was perfectly cooked and the servings were very generous. Our server had us out of there in under an hour to make our show! I highly recommend this place and will definetely be dinning here in the future."}
{"text":"- Good fries - A bit too pricey for most dishes - Good steaks, I got the Tuna one - A bit small and cramped"}
{"text":"We came in for summerlicious 2016. The menu had a lot of great options so we decided to try it out!  Starting off, service was horrible from our waitress. Our server was very hard to find and she rarely came even near the table. We ended up having to catch other waitresses and the bar tender to help us find her so we can refill water or grab the bill.   Food was good though. We started off with calamari and the crab lobster soup. I found the soup a bit salty, but good flavors and I love the puff pastry over the soup.  For mains we ordered the morrocan lamb and steak. The steak had a great crust of pepper and salt seasoning on top and was cooked as I preferred. The lamb was well spiced over a lovely bed of veggies and couscous.   Dessert was nice. We had the cheesecake and grilled pear with ice cream. Nothing overly sweet.  Over all food was good, service (for our particular waitress) was bad, atmosphere was okay. I don't think it's somewhere I'd be looking to return to."}
{"text":"me and my friends went there for 2017 summerlicious. Given the fact that I have been there before, I thought I would give their summerlicious dish Seafood Paella a try. The meal started with their famous soup which is good as usual, however, we were disappointed by the seafood paella. The rice was hard to chew, and the seafood was not marinated. The dish looked like it has a lot of tomato sauce, but it actually tasted cheesy and heavy. We couldn't finish seafood paella. We ordered gelato for dessert to end the meal.   Fred's not here is a restaurant that has been around for a long time, I think it's time for some improvements. The prime location helps business, but good food will always be the main reason for costumers to return."}
{"text":"Available to book on open table makes it convenient to get a reso. Service is good but food is a little to salty.  3.25/5 *"}
{"text":"I have been here for Winterlicious. Usually get the Lobster & Crab for app. The main, I go for the steak. Cheesecake for desert. Overall, it is standard food. I wouldn't say it is much better than what I could pull off at home with a little bit of time. The best part of this place would be the ambiance. I really like when you can see some of the action in the kitchen from your seat. I would come here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for this place. In the area, there are definitely some better options though."}
{"text":"Just squeezed in a reservation here for the last weekend of Summerlicious and I'm very glad I did. I opted for the iconic crab and lobster bisque, steak salad, and finished off with the fresh fruit ice (sorbet basically). Without a doubt, my favourite was the crab and lobster bisque. It was full of flavour and the light and fluffy pastry topping was definitely the best part about this appetizer. And as a steak enthusiast, I must say I was pretty disappointed with the steak salad, not only was this dish not in line with their online Summerlicious menu (named \"steak & frite\"), the steak was lackluster in flavour, texture and presentation. The fruit ice was nice and refreshing, but nothing to write home about.   I really did want to give Fred's Not Here a 4-star rating but when the main is mediocre at best and the resto is supposedly known for its wood grilled steak, I had to reevaluate."}
{"text":"Really disappointed by my experience there during the summerlicious 2014. The only great thing was the service. I sat downstairs where the walls are dusty and my seat was sticky. The lobster and crab soup had no chunk of crab and lobster!  After a few mouthful of soup a cloud of fruitflies  came on top of my soup and fell into my beer. My steak taste great , it was big and cook as I wanted. It was coming with a side cone of fries which was stuff with paper (in order to spare the fries)! So, I had almost no fries to eat with my big steak. I took the desert to go and threw it in the trash. Also, I need to mention that 15 min later I got sick."}
{"text":"It's summerlicious time and this time we decided to go for a slightly cheaper menu rather than the usual $45.  The menu here looked pretty good, what our party liked the best about it was the amount of option they give. Usually for summelicious (or winterlicious) you choose between 2-3 options for each course, this place gives you about 5.   I had the baked crab and lobster soup for the appetizer. This was really good, it had puff pastry baked on top of it and the soup itself was nice and peppery. There were no actual pieces of crab or lobster meat in there but for $35 price fix, what do you really expect?  For the main I chose the new york strip steak. It was accompanied by some mushrooms, green beans and duck fat fries. Hurray for duck fat! The steak was done just as I'd ordered, and everything else tasted great. The mushrooms were garlicky.. and I loves me some garlic.  The dessert option for me was the daily cheesecake, which happened to be creme brulee. This was only ok for me. My bf finished half of it for me.  The service here was 50/50. Our server was terrible. Rude, and almost non-existent. A party member ordered the prime rib and she didn't even offer horse radish. When he asked for some she was quick to reply and say they did not have any. O-kay, you serve duck fat fries but you have no horse radish for your prime rib? Give me a break. Laziness on her part. But everyone else there seemed to be great. The host was nice, and other servers came by our table to help out with whatever we needed.   Overall, not a bad place to go to. I would recommend if you are in the area catching a broadway show."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with co-workers as I'm always excited to have the lobster and crab soup that is topped with puff pastry.  Baked Lobster and Crab Soup w/ Shot of Sherry ($9.49) This has always been good and is consistently delicious. The soup is very flavourful and there are generous chunks of lobster and crab. The puff pastry is nice and flakey making it the perfect combination.  Lobster Americaine ($29.99) I normally get the ribeye here with duck fat fries but there fryer was broken and I didn't want to have mashed potatoes so I tried this lobster pasta. It was terrible. The lobster was a generous portion but was so mushy that it wasn't fresh at all. It also had a few random clams and mussels that weren't advertised on the menu on a bed of fettuccine. The sauce was very oily and didn't have any flavour at all.  Belgian Double Chocolate Mousse Cake ($7.99) This cake was actually pretty good. Moist, not too sweet and had a delectable chocolate taste."}
{"text":"I love the lobster and crab soup and seafood paella. Service can be a hit and miss. Place is decent but I think if they did some renovations, it would get more foot traffic."}
{"text":"Great location on Kings entertainment district.   Food was decent.   I ordered the salmon and I didn't realize that it would be deep fried. Or so it seemed that it was. Had I known I would not have ordered it. As this does not agree with my tummy.  The sauce on it was delicious.   My partner had the pene chicken pasta. If you love olives you will like this plate.   Portions were decent.    Desert was ok but lacked more flavour and richness. Presentation was nice.   Atmosphere inside was very dark and had an older feel to it.   Service was normal nothing extra special. They take your order and get your food done. They seemed to be pretty busy throughout our dining experience.   Hostess did not thank us or say by as we left.   Since there are several door to door restaurants competing for guests, I would probably give all the others a try first before coming back."}
{"text":"8 oz steak: a bit too tough despite it being medium rare, but the crispy outer layer was nice touch  Frites: they were more like potato chips to be honest"}
{"text":"The food arrived and I found myself critiquing mostly in Food Network Top Chef style fashion - looks good but tastes blah.  I came here as a part of our 20+ team project successful release celebration but was truly disappointed. I had the vegetable soup to start with Ricotta and Spinach ravioli. Here's my biggest issue - if you are loud enough to state an ingredient in the title, ensure you can actually taste it, not just see it sprinkled like parsley along with the ricotta.  But it doesn't just end there- who puts the sauteed veggies along with ravioli in a broth? Both me and 3 of my other colleagues felt the same way - no sauce?!? broth?? really?? there was no saving this dish , not even with the fresh cheese or black pepper on top.  As for the soup, tasted like can of chick peas mixed in with another can of Campbell's vegetable soup.   Gourmet? I think not. Yes, Fred was right to flee. Wish we'd caught onto the clues sooner."}
{"text":"I am really surprised I am giving a well-rated place a 3-star but such was my experience (unfortunately). I took my parents out for a Winterlicious lunch (2013) and we were a tad disappointed. Here's why:  1. We were seated in the basement which is TACKY in lack of a better word. I was expecting something classier from a \"$$$\" rated place. Also, we were seated right in front of the kitchen, which unfortunately didn't look very clean.   2. Usually my Summerlicious/Winterlicious experiences are great, so pardon me if I was not impressed by a small-person's-palm-sized steak, sided with shrivelly beans and fries. The dish did not scream $$$ out to me at all. Good value for a $20 meal during Winterlicious, but please keep in mind that this meal would be stupidly expensive otherwise.   3. I asked the waitress to bring mayonnaise for my fries (that's how I like it). She mumbled something about having to go upstairs to get it and never came back with it.   4. The place was cold... we were sitting with our jackets on.   Verdict? I am probably not going back unless a very good looking guy chooses to take me to Fred's Not Here for a dinner date. :)"}
{"text":"** Review on Winterlicious Lunch 2017 ($23) **  I've heard of Fred's Not Here a lot from friends so when I noticed that it's part of the Winterlicious lineup this year I've decided to give it a try. I booked my reservation online using OpenTable.com and it was super quick and easy, and I prefer this way much more than calling them to reserve my table. You can easily change your reservation and look for alternative times on the website as well.   Environment: The restaurant itself is good size for the location that it occupies on King St. West. It had a really nice ambiance with cool paintings on the wall. At the back there was an open kitchen where you could look into how the food was prepared. Despite it being an open kitchen, the smell didn't go through to the dining area, which was good.  The restaurant was mostly filled when we arrived for our 12pm reservation on Sunday, but since we called ahead we got seated promptly. I noticed that the restaurant was very loud because there were many tables in a small space. Also, I didn't like how our table was so close to another table beside us that it might as well be the same table, because I could hear everything the other table was talking very clearly. Like seriously I don't care how the people on the other table was doing and I have no intention of having them listening to our conversation either.   Food: Our server told us the most popular dishes for the Winterlicious lunch were the Lobster and crab soup for appetizer, Steak and pasta for entrée, and Cheesecake for dessert, which were what I got. We also tried the Caesar salad for appetizer, Seafood Fettuccine for entrée, and Chocolate almond torte for dessert.  -    Lobster and Crab Soup: I was amazed by the soup because the presentation was really nice and it tasted delicious. On top of the soup bowl we had a layer of puffed pastry, which was really soft and fluffy on its own and tasted great if you dip it in the soup was well. The soup was really hot (in terms of temperature) and it had a nice spicy kick to it, but I really liked how it tasted. Unlike most spicy foods, the spiciness in the soup lingered in my throat area, and it be easily washed down with a sip of water. Just as I expected, there was not a trace of seafood in the soup, similar to many lobster bisques, but for its original price $10, it's a really good choice for Winterlicious appetizer.   -    Caesar Salad: It didn't really look like the traditional Caesar salad and in my opinion it didn't taste very great, plus the portion was pretty small.  Steak and Pasta: The server offered freshly ground black pepper and feta cheese on the dish. At first glance the dish didn't look very big, but it was surprisingly very filling and was good portion for a lunch entrée. The angel hair Pasta was really thin, which reminded of vermicelli, and I like the flavor with the tomato sauce. The steak was nicely grilled to medium rare as I specified and I really liked the woody charcoal flavor. One thing I noticed was the lack of salt in both the steak and the pasta that I basically had to sprinkle my table salt vigorously to get the flavor that I liked. I wish they could have marinated the steak.  -    Seafood Fettuccine: Also came with freshly ground pepper and cheese at your request. It food looked good and there were good amount of seafoods in there. We even found a small lobster tail!! The flavor was good, similar to the pasta mentioned above, but also lacked salt.  -    Mango & Berries Cheesecake: The cheesecake was actually pretty small, most likely smaller than their normal dessert portion since Winterlicious is at a discounted price. The flavor was good and the cake was soft and creamy with no ice shards. -    Chocolate Almond Torte: This was another cake actually, and similar to the cheesecake, the portion was rather small. It looked like your average multilayered chocolate cake but I really liked the rich chocolatey flavor and I was glad it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet.   Service: I think our waiter did a great job at serving our table while managing the other tables. He was really humorous and sociable, and he took the time to explain to us some of the dishes on the menu.    Overall, for the $23 you pay for the Winterlicious lunch at Fred's Not Here it was pretty worth it, given that you get a 3-course lunch and they offered a really large menu to cater to different tastes. The dinner menu had some of the repeats of the lunch menu, including the fan-favourite lobster and crab soup."}
{"text":"Summerlicious (most reviews mention that or winterlicious) visit included awful service and perhaps even worse food. Easily our worst meal in Toronto."}
{"text":"I came to this place a couple of weeks ago for winterlicious during dinner.  The service was great as our waiter was extremely attentive and friendly. He was very patient and provided a lot of information on the wide variety of choices from the winterlicious menu. For the appetizer, I had the baked lobster and crab soup. Like what others had said, I thought the dish was great! The soup was very flavourful and smooth.  For the entree, I had the roasted lobster and seafood linguine. The seafood linguine was a huge portion and I was pleasantly surprised with the abundance of seafood in it.  My only issue was the dessert as I had the chocolate almond torte. I thought the dessert was just okay as it was nothing outstanding. This place is more of a 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I can't tell if Fred's Not Here or there is simply an absence of a head chef and customer service.   Upon sitting down with our large party, we were rushed the whole time. We were told it was going to be a busy night since its Winterlicious and they were having two dinner time slots. Reasonable explanation had the restaurant been not half empty.   First course was the famous Baked crab and lobster bisque. It contained no meat. My puff pastry was deflated like Pamela Anderson's implants. The bisque was completely overpowered with hot sauce and continues to burn my stomach as I write this scathing review.   The steak frites had been over cooked well done steak as did every person at my table. I am going to speculate they pre-cooked every steak up to a certain point and reheat the steaks. My sides included exactly 4 green beans and 3 sliced mushrooms.   They re-cooked my steak that I ordered Medium Rare and this time instead of well done was Medium Well. I let this slide.   The whole 2 hours, water was never refilled once. At about 8pm we were told that we needed to go and that other diners have been waiting 10 minutes.   As we were walking out, we did not see a single soul in sight. I guess the people waiting were all named Fred. The restaurant was 30% full at this point, on a Saturday night. I guess our waiter got his 18% gratuity for a large party and really didn't care if he provided excellent service or not.  Do not come here. Do not recommend.   Service 1/10  Food 2/10 Restaurant Name 10/10"}
{"text":"Food was EXCELLENT. Great ambience with great music. The dish I had was just cooked to perfection  as well season well. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I ate here on Sunday May 17 2015.  Food was great!   I had the Seafood paella... The portion was good and the flavor was well rounded.  All seafood was cooked well, and not over cooked. Also had the Smoked Salmon on green onion pancake.... This was fantastic.  Service was good. All around a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious menu. The tablecloth had brown stains on it but overall had a romantic, dimmed-light ambiance.   Unfortunately we were not offered bread for the table although every other table did. We both ordered the baked lobster soup, I ordered the featured cocktail as well to start. The soup was quite good, the dough was flaky and was very warm but the soup was had a lot of white pepper taste and a thin consistency.   For entrees we had the steak and fries as well as the mushroom agnolotti. Both entrees were satisfying but the steak was quite small, which might be understandable since it was winterlicious.   For desserts, we had the apple crumble cheesecake and the sorbet which were both very tasty, all in all, a good experience, but would only return for winterlicious prices."}
{"text":"I came here for the summerlicous because I have heard great things about this restaurant. I got the cesear salad for my appetizer. It was average, but i regret not getting the lobster bisque which is a famous item on the menu. For my main I got the California Steak with fries. The steak was good, but what surprised me was how delicious the fries were. The fries were well bakes and a generous portion. Finally, for my dessert I got the cheese cake, which was decent.  Overall I enjoyed my experience at fred. The customer service and atmosphere was great and I liked the free bread they gave."}
{"text":"Was here for Winterlicious yesterday for lunch - overall very attentive service and the food was good.   Between me and my bf we got the lobster bisque soup and calamari to start. Soup was amazing, I ended up making him give me half the bowl but the calamari wasn't amazing. I would recommend the soup which was great!!!  Then for the main we got steak and the paella. The portions (unlike other Winterlicious places I have been to) are big! I couldn't finish :( but the steak was better than the paella in my opinion!   Overall, it was a good Winterlicious experience :)"}
{"text":"A friend booked this restaurant as a surprise birthday party for her bf, but even though reservations were set the tables were not ready until the very last minute, and we were all worried that the birthday guy would show up and everybody would still be scattered in the bar area.  Luckily we all finally got seated by the time he came.  The food at this restaurant was really good though and their portions were huge.  I had the ribs and they were nice and smokey and their fries were fried in animal fat, but was nowhere near the level of awesomeness that the Beer Bistro fries were at.  One of the guests had an overdone steak too, but it was replaced after the waiter inspected it.  Although I said I liked the food I would say that it is comparable to The Keg, nothing more, and pricier than The Keg.  I just expect more when the restaurant is a bit pricier.  I also found it weird that their menu had a mismatch of items from curries to steaks.  I'm not sure what to think of that.  I like that this place does not charge a cake cutting fee and was more than happy to serve the cupcakes that I brought for the party.  A 20% gratuity was added to our bills, but the waiter was happy to split the bills individually amongst all of us.  Overall, I'd say it was a good choice of restaurant for the birthday party but only because they serviced the group quite well and there are some decent bars in the area."}
{"text":"Good food and good service = good date night! After eyeing this place for quite sometime, I finally made reservation for summerlicious. Arrived an hour early and found our table has been set and reserved since the place was quite busy.   Super happy with almost everything we ordered except the calamari grilled appetizer. Need more grilling time and the sauce it bleh! But everything else, from the crab & lobster soup, steak, paella and desserts were amazing.   The paella has lots of seafood - large shrimp, mussels, claims, squid and half lobster. The rice was cooked with just the right amount of tomato sauce to make it moist with melted cheese on some part. There is hint of spice which I enjoyed!  Steak was cooked perfectly. Oh! I love their gelato dessert. Coffee tofee yum!"}
{"text":"Where to begin....another day in Toronto, another food experience, sat outside on a brisk afternoon and looked at the menu. Our waiter, tall guy, nice with a strange affect, kinda like is he high or hungover, his speech and lack of speed....yea. so we started with the lobster bisque which was presented with the croissant like bread baked over ontop of it ( cute) bisque was hot and thick. We ordered two entrees, the shrimp pasta dish and asked for scallops on the side, we were craving seafood. It took 45 minutes to get a dish that takes 12 minutes to cook. We looked for our waiter who was now overwhelmed. We were the first table in the restaurant. We watched as orders hot the table out of sequence and to wrong tables. My gf and I agreed that if the plates didn't come out in 2 minutes we were done. Lucky for Fred and company our meals finally came out. It was good, but not worth waiting for. I would never come back here based on service. it was a weekday and we were the first table. The free glass of wine didn't help....well maybe a little. We still tipped our waiter."}
{"text":"My cuzin and I went here for dinner before catching a show at the Royal Alex. Summary: the service is very friendly but the food was very very poor. I give them credit for trying to be creative by creating fixed menus themed by the current shows that are playing on the strip, however their execution was so low quality. I order the cod au gratin and it was actually cold (some of the cheese was not even melted) and tasteless. I've never had to add more salt in my life and I never add salt to anything. The *four* green beans I received on the side were buttered as advertised but honestly the best part were the shoe string fries in the basket :/ So sad...they were a busy place, mostly filled with elderly people at the time as I guess that was the majority audience for the surrounding shows. Our server disappeared at the end of or dinner and the seating hostess had to take our payment. Not recommended and will not return."}
{"text":"Came to Fred's Not Here for Canadian version of restaurant week lunch. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much after reviewing the summerlicious options and meh/average ratings. But I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty all the foods were!   We started off with their famous lobster crab soup. I often find all lobster soup/bisque to be wayyyy too salty. But I would never get tired of Fred's! Perfectly seasoned, creamy yet light, with a hint of sweetness. The standout of this soup? - Flakey, buttery, beyond delicious, baked croissant pastry crust on top - Just covered the whole bowl with it already!   Lobster, mussels with angel hair in marinara sauce - I thought I would only pick at the seafood and leave the \"boring\" angel hair alone. But I ended up polishing my entire bowl. For lunch prefix, I was surprised that my dish came with whole lobster tail with shell on! My Angel hair was cooked perfectly and the marinara complemented it so well! The flavor was spot on - I couldn't get enough!   Baked clams with linguine in white wine sauce - my mother in law gave me a good portion of hers to \"taste\" - light and flavorful - finished my bowl then hers too. Another winning choice!   Steak and rigatoni in marinara sauce - before I could look up, my husband had already polished his dish! The steak was perfectly made to his liking. He did wish that there was another sauce option - marinara was a little boring to him (he's not a big tomato fan). Nevertheless, he ate it all!   Desserts - baked apple cheesecake, almond cake, grilled peach with vanilla ice cream - all were half portions of what they usually come in - all were good but nothing stood out. The apple cheesecake was a little mushier than what we were used to. The almond cake tasted more like chocolate brownie with almond bits. The grilled peach - definition of summerlicious - light and refreshing!   Overall - $23 for three courses that included lobster and steak? My husband and I sure picked the perfect weekend to visit!  Summerlicious or not, our family would definitely return to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Came here frequently when I was working down the street. Not sure why there are so many negative reviews, my experiences here was always fantastic, good service, good attitude and a pretty nice environment. I was definitely expecting more on the main courses(for the price of the dishes), but except for that, it's a nice \"drop by for some Italian\" place, can't really go too wrong here. P.s. try their crab soup, it's pretty good"}
{"text":"Only two words - THE BEST. Lets start. We came around 6.30, restaurant was soooo full! Pretty young hostess (I hope my wife doesn't follow me) asked about reservation and we got a nice around table. Server came immediately with water, smile and nice accent. He was so friendly, professional, polite.  We ordered:  - soup (absolutely delicious, all ingredients were perfect match) - mussels (was good, but little bit too much garlic for me) - kale salad (honest, nothing special, just ok) - stuffed mushrooms with escargot (it was the best!) - rib steak (fml, he said \"its 10 oz\" it was 20!!! Huge portion with mushed potato and beens) - lobster seafood fettuccine ( half lobster, clams, mussels...) - steak friters ( absolutely delicious pepper corn sauce, very tender) Good job guys!!! With every dish, Andre recommend drinks. My steak with perfect match with glass of wine. P.S. For Server Andre and Manager!!! All night we tried to figure out , where he is from, he didn't tell us, we named 16 countries!!!!!! And on top of that, when he brought the bill, he wrote \"Thank you\" on 12 different languages!!! And when last time, my Mom asked him: Which country???? Answer was - \" I will tell you next time, when you back\"... Epic..."}
{"text":"Went here as my bf & I were in the area for a show. I've been here 2 times prior to this & always enjoyed the food. The waitress we had was nice & even recommended which dish to order. My bf couldn't decide between the appetizers (scallops) & she said get smth else as it wasn't worth it! Imagine that... :) We really appreciated her telling us. In the end we both had the crab cake which was(about $ 9) delish!!  My guy ordered the ... 6-hour oven slow roasted Alberta certified \"high river\" angus beef brisket w// yukon gold & celeriac mash ($18.99). I had a taste and thought it was just a little bit on the salty side & joked it must've cuz they cooked it for '6 hours' :) But it was very tasty.    I had the ...Roasted deep sea scallops w/ beef short rib risotto w/ mixed truffle scented field mushrooms & baby spinach ($ 24.99). So worth it! The scallops were juicy & perfect. As was the risotto.  Overall, we liked the place. Def one of those special occasion restaurants as it is on the pricy side."}
{"text":"Decent meal for the price. The lobster bisque is always amazing. The last steak I had was okay, nothing special. Service is hit and miss. Worth it if in the area but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTED! so according to a lot of my friends, this restaurant is supposedly \"SOOO GOOOOD\" but turns out its just yet another overrated one. i swearrr do i just go to these \"good\" restaurants on their bad days or sth??  so their lobster crap soup that they're famous for was indeed tastey but it LACKED sth to chew on. the soup was purely liquified but i like my soup with a lil bit of bite. i was expecting at least some chunks of vegetables or meat of some sort to munch on!  the main was seafood grill with lobster, tiger shrimp and a piece of fish. UGH  the fettucine that came with it was SO DRY and tasteless. i barely touched it. the fish was burnt AND tasteless and my dad can make better shrimp and lobster than what they served.  the dessert was some cut up strawberries with a slab of marscapone cheese on top.  overall this restaurant.....is reasonably priced considering they give out large portions but the flavours were just lackingggg everywhereeeee. except the soup i guess which had a ton of salt/msg in it."}
{"text":"Fred's was recommended as a convenient bite before our Toronto broadway show.  They were promoting a steak and lobster dinner on the night we went.  Steak and lobster, in Canada, means steak OR lobster.  My dad ordered this and had the lobster.  This came with a caesar salad for 30 dollars.  The lobster was good but not anything to write home about.  I had the 30 dollar lamb which was on the dry side but were served with a chipotle BBQ sauce.  Smother the sauce over the lamb and you can barely tell that the lamb is dry.  The waitress told us that the creme brulee and bread pudding were their specialty so we ordered both.  The sugar on top of the creme brulee was burnt more than I cared for but my dad liked the extra bitter taste.  The bread pudding is homemade.  One would expect that a restaurant with $30 entrees would care about the bread they serve.  There were three breads presented to us, cornbread, brown bread, white bread.  They were cold.  The butter was cold and stiff.  The service was slow and it took a long time for our food to come out.  Unless you're like me and need to try every restaurant in existence, pass on this one."}
{"text":"Went simple with a buffalo chicken and blue cheese salad.  Atmosphere was very nice and the best was the French fries."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. First time I came for Winterlicious and I thought this place was great! (Mainly due to the dishes you get for the price - baked lobster soup, paella or steak, dessert; all for $35 or $40, can't remember)   But my second time here made me think this place was just okay. I got the seafood paella for $35 (my first time eating this, I remember this was part of Winterlicious as well) . It's more than enough for one person, and comes with a lobster claw, and half of one side of the lobster body, as well as shrimp, mussels, clams, and one scallop (yep, one). The taste didn't impress me and I didn't leave wanting to try this dish again or highly recommend it to someone. It was just 'not bad'.. For the price. Or perhaps this dish was overhyped to me by my friends..   Overall decent restaurant though!"}
{"text":"I read somewhere ..' be like Fred, don't be here' I agree with this statement 100%.   We had reservations and only to be greeted with 'im busy, I don't care you have a reservation. You wait\".   30 mins later we are seated.   Took forever for the food to arrive. The lobster soup was pretty good. Interesting concept. Baked with a puff on top. The rest of the meal was not good. I had the scallops and the bread pudding.   Anyway in short, be like Fred."}
{"text":"idk man, it was really f-ing expensive and I didn't enjoy a single dish we ordered..  We had the \"well known/famous\" gnocchi dish .. the rainbow trout.. and the fried calamari. all of which were mediocre at best.   It was a pretty painfully slow process to get this food too.. from the ordering wait time, to the time it took to actually get the dishes, to the time it took to pay the bill and get out.   bad experience man, and felt like a huge waste of 100 bucks. maybe I just ordered all the wrong things. anyway. I wouldn't come back and gamble another 100+ after today."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times it was great! I ordered steak twice (coz I enjoyed it the first time) and it came out to my liking! Their losbter bisque soup and the duck frites were enjoyable as well. If you are looking for a good place to enjoy steak, I would recommend this place especially during the summerlicious/winterlicious event."}
{"text":"First time here, very ambient atmosphere as it is good for dates and social gatherings. I bought my friend here to experience the infamous soup as it was recommended by my friend. I would say it was very delicious even with the puff pastry on top made it yummy. I had the steak, it is very yummy and for dessert the almond cheesecake was divine. Very yummy tasting food. Hope to try their regular menu soon."}
{"text":"I went to Fred's Not Here for the Winterlicious 2018 3-Course Lunch Menu - $28 per person with a group of 4 people.   [SERVICE] - 5/5 Our server was very attentive and personable!   [FOOD QUALITY] - 3.5/5 There were a few hiccups in the entrées, but the 3-Course Lunch Menu is definitely worth the price. A lot of intricate flavours complemented each other in every dish, and the quality of ingredients was definitely above average.   [ORDER] Appetizers:   - Famous Baked Lobster & Crab Soup: definitely met my standards as I heard a lot of great things about this dish. The bisque was smooth, rich and exploded with very prominent, but not fishy lobster and crab flavours.   - Chopped Kale Salad with Miso Tahini Dressing & Chopped Walnuts: the exact opposite of a boring, and one-dimensional kale salad. The nutty and creamy dressing complemented the fresh kale. Chopped walnuts also added an extra crunch added a different dimension to this salad.   - Baked Stuffed Mushroom w/ Escargot, Pinot Grigio Garlic Butter: escargot was meaty, and topped with butter that uses acidity from Pinot Grigio to cut through the fat content.   Entrées:  - Pan Roasted Fresh Tilapia, Tomato Garlic Butter Sauce, Duck Fat Fries & Vegetables: tilapia was juicy and the sauce did not overpower natural flavours of the fish. Duck fat fries were not crispy and individual fries were too small. I prefer crispy, thick-cut fries, rather than small and soggy potato sticks. Vegetables helped balance out the greasiness of the fries.   - 3-Hour Slow Roasted Quebec Harpur Farm Venison in Chianti with Malfada Noodles and Garlic Spinach: venison meat was tender but a little gamey. Malfada noodles were al-dente and absorbed flavours from the Chianti quite well. Garlic spinach added a lighter component to the otherwise heavy dish.   Dessert:  - Apple & Caramel Cheesecake: has a different consistency than a traditional New York cheesecake. A lighter, but still very flavourful and tastes like an apple pie sprinkled on top of a cheesecake.    - Baked Banana Chocolate Bread Pudding w/ Warm Caramel Rum Sauce: soft and smooth consistency, contrasted with chewy chunks of bread. The bread chunks were kind of dry, but the rum sauce added a little but of moisture to the dry pieces.   - Chocolate Almond Torte: sweet, rich, and velvety with a cake-like consistency. There are also bitter undertones that pair well with the denser components of the torte.   [OVERALL] - 4/5 I would recommend the restaurant for the Winterlicious menu, but I would not order the two entrées on their own."}
{"text":"First of all I am really surprised by some of the negative reviews here. Especially about how some people complained about an 18% added to the bills for larger groups. Most servers work hard and deserve their tips, and I know from experience a lot of them get 'stiffed' on their tips on large groups.    The restaurant is very clean and inviting and has a very nice ambiance to it. Their signature dish is the baked lobster and crab soup (possibly the best soup I have ever had in my life) and another great side dish is their fried which are cooked in duck fat, simply amazing on their own, without any condiments.  I had a medium rare New York steak, which was cooked on wood coals,  and it was cooked to perfection. One thing I noticed was that there was no ketchup or steak sauce on the tables, but after eating here I could see why. When you have great food, you don't need any additional flavour 'boosters'.   Our waiter Doug was friendly, fast and very efficient, and thanked us twice after we had finished our meal.  Prices are very competitive compared to other establishments in this area and they do have a $29.00 menu which has several great options and includes a main course and an entry.   The location on King is fantastic, but if you are attending a theatrical performance or sporting event allow yourself some time as this place can get very busy.I would suggest making a reservation!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious, even the bread and butter! The surf and turf with angel hair pasta was amazing. Staff was very accommodating and kind especially given the amount of time before the kitchen closes (10 minutes). The ambiance and the music was fitting.  Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Second try. Still a good four. Good food but I would advise to stick to other-than-BBQ meals. If you want BBQ ribs or chicken, go elsewhere. Other meals are really good.  Service remains improvable (male waiters really can be rough here - female waitresses are much nicer)"}
{"text":"My roommate and I came back to Fred's Not Here after trying their Summerlicious menu - In particular we came back for the Lobster Crab bisque soup and seafood paella!   We were sat on the patio which is a great people watching spot in the heart of Toronto. Here's a review of both dishes I ordered:  Lobster Bisque Soup - The best I've ever had! It is silky, creamy and tasty all at the same time. The best part is the buttery crispy dough that is baked on top of the bowl to dip with the soup.  Paella - Huge portion with two lobster tails and lots of other seafood. I don't have any other paellas to compare this to in the city, but my friend did say it was comparable to the paella at Patria, which says something about the quality of this dish!  I would definitely come back for these two items in particular but maybe during Winterlicious/Summerlicious when it is significantly cheaper to have both + a dessert!"}
{"text":"They have small plates so I ordered quite a few. One didn't arrive. The drink I chose couldn't be made as they ran out of one ingredient. The service was somewhat inattentive and slow. The food was decent. They need to up the food quality, service and ambience without raising prices and this might work out to be a good place."}
{"text":"Came  for Summerlicious lunch, first negative was we were seated in the Red Tomato basement section.  The server appeared to be preoccupied with something other than serving.   The menu items all appeared to be nice but due to a screw up, no calamari...  Ordered the kale salad and 2 protien packed cockroaches crawled out.  Entrees sounded yummy but the sizes are half of what they used to be.  The steak was a 4oz serving with 6 rigatoni pasta shells - lacked flavor and texture.  Lobster with mussels were tiny Caribbean tails that were overcooked with 2 of 3 mussels being bad over a bed of vermecelli (not angel hair).  Salmon was very overcooked and almost rubbery.  Desserts were all passable, only acceptable was the fruit ice but was a little too sweet for being true fruit"}
{"text":"Again... 3 stars is harsh for this place. I absolutely enjoyed their lobster crab bisque and their price fix menu is good! There is better steak out there but I like coming here for a $45 3 course steak dinner.   What I didn't like is the staff. They're quite rude when I called in for a reservation. Their tone sounded like they didn't care to accommodate."}
{"text":"Came for Summerlicious on my friend's recommendation and I thought the menu was pretty great for the value. The baked lobster and crab soup is unique but keep in mind that it's a soup and not a bisque, so it's going to be on the watery side. Truthfully, the soup is nothing special but the pastry is definitely the highlight and worth the appetizer choice.   Chose the steak for the entree and I was quite underwhelmed - it came out a little lukewarm and tasted like it could use a little more seasoning. The duck fat frites that came on the side were a different story... I couldn't stop eating those! Dessert was standard - you usually can't mess up dessert very much.  An added plus was that the service didn't suck despite it being Summerlicious. We had our waters filled up pretty consistently and it wasn't hard to flag someone down when we needed something."}
{"text":"Fred's Not Here is one of the better restaurants on King Street. I've been here a few times for lunch and even for Summerlicious. Yesterday I had the two-course lunch - the always delicious, pipping hot, lobster and crab soup topped with a baked flaky pastry and the mushroom agnolotti with truffle grana padano sauce. Agnolottis are like raviolis, but are half-mooned shaped. It's a vegetarian mushroom pasta dish and I would recommend it to anyone who loves mushrooms as much as I do. I've also had their steak frites and grilled cheese sandwich with beef brisket. If you work in the area or are looking to grab a bite before a show, I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I love Fred's Not Here and I usually get the Steak and Lobster & Crab soup. The Lobster and Crab soup is more of a bisque with a puff pastry on top. It's peppery, creamy, smooth and just delicious. I always get this as an appetizer, no matter how appealing the other ones sound because I'm sure I'll regret it.  This winterlicious my friend and I tried two entrees offered on the menu: the slow roasted duck confit and the 2 way pork. The slow roast duck confit was served over pesto gnocchi. It was tender and was preferred over the 2 way pork, but I only wish it was served with fries and veggies as the pesto gnocchi slightly overpowered the duck confit. The 2 way pork was... meh. The ribs were pretty standard, fall off the bone with a sweet and spicy sauce. The pork belly was very odd. My friend and I are used to chinese roasted pork, which is exactly what the pork belly looked like. You immediately knew the difference once you put it in your mouth as pork belly is EXTREMELY sticky. So sticky I had to use my fork to pry it off my teeth while chewing and the skin was more hard than crispy. My favourite part the 2 way pork were the duck fat frites, but that may just be my obsession with fries.  For dessert we got the white chocolate lemon cheesecake and the chocolate almond torte, of which both have misleading names. The cheesecake was more of a tart lemon cake as the lemon overpowered the cheesiness of the cake and was served on a raspberry sauce. The chocolate almond torte was just a chocolate cake as opposed to a moussey torte. But we enjoyed mixing the raspberry sauce and the chocolate cake to create a black forest cake.  Make sure to make reservations! We came when they opened and it quickly filled up."}
{"text":"I agree with previous reviewers.  This place was recommended as great - but I found it to be barely OK.  Had a filet that, I'm not sure was actually a filet and not a \"fake\".  When I asked about bearnaise - they said \"we have hollandaise\".  Hollandaise on a steak?  Really?  I can see if you have it around for veg dressing, but to recommend if for a steak?  Anyway, the crab cake appetizer was burnt on the bottom, and barely edible. The steak, as I mentioned, was \"eh\".  I wouldn't ever consider going back here."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure - don't let the name fool you! I've walked by this place every morning on my way to work and have thought it's a pub-style type of place due to the name. Boy, was I wrong!  It is a quaint restaurant, simply but tastefully decorated with a small patio (maybe 5 tables), right on the sidewalk (great for people watching!) they have a pretty big menu and different types food to choose from - soups, salads, pastas, pizzas, mains and some burgers, not to mention a decent size wine list. The food was absolutely delicious (see photo). Everything was flavorful and the presentation was done well! We had the white mushroom pizza, the mushroom agnolotti with mushroom truffle butter sauce and the baked lobster and crab soup, along with two glasses of rose and a martini. The total bill was $80 which is not bad for the amount of food and drinks we had!    Service was great, our waiter was fantastic, very friendly and helpful - was a pleasant experience :) I rarely tip 25%, but the overall experience was just great!  We definitely will be back as there are a few other menu items that caught our eye - unfortunately our eyes are bigger than our stomache!"}
{"text":"I came with a group of 6 to Fred's Not Here for Summerlicious 2011. I had heard great things about it, but was very disappointed.  I ordered the lobster and crab soup appetizer, ribeye with mashed potato entree, and the chocolate mousse dessert. The appetizer was the only part of my meal that blew me away.. It looked and tasted amazing! The steak was tough and sub-par, and the dessert was CRAP. They ran out of chocolate mousse, so they gave us JUST CAKE. It tasted like day-old, dry, pre-made cake and they topped it with mint. I'm assuming a chef quit on them that night because it took forever to get dessert.   My girlfriend got the cod curry (I think that's what it was) and it was delicious. Unfortunately she wasn't feeling well so she barely had any of it.. She doesn't know if it was from the appetizer, so I won't blame it directly on Fred's Not Here.  Overall, as I mentioned, we were all very disappointed and upset that we had to wait so long for our sub-par dishes. 1/5"}
{"text":"Went for summerlicious. Got seated at a pretty awful table, the first table in, asked to be moved.... Got moved to another bad table right by the pass and a bunch of glassware storage carts even though the restaurant was probably around 45% capacity with no reservation signs.   Food was okay. Cornbread was dry, the soup was fine, but the pastry was kind of soggy/soft. The steak was cooked to how I specified, but it had a lot of chewy bits. The paella was really good but the lobster definitely had that frozen mushy texture. The halibut/prawns were very good, the pasta was kind of soft. The grilled peach dessert was good. The cheesecake was super tiny but good.  The server was nice but during the mains I felt rushed as she started to clear my plates though I was still eating.  Overall a \"good\" experience, not what I had expected as I was expecting much more."}
{"text":"Finally been there in person for some reason. Food is okay. The lobster soup is pretty good. But for this quality I'm not willing to get a bad service. With the pros and cons even out, it's a 3 star I guess."}
{"text":"I've dined here several times, but on this particular visit, 4 of us popped in for a Winterliscious lunch.   Food portion size was gigantic....all four of left us stuffed !  Appetizers: One person ordered the Arugula Salad, with radicchio, apples. She loved it. I had the Caesar. The dressing was garlicky. No croutons or bacon, but plenty of shaven Parmesan. 2 people ordered the lobster/crab soup, with puff pastry on top. They both were expecting it to be a hearty soup, with meat pieces in it, but it was just a broth. They both really loved it though and were not disappointed.  Lunch: Two ppl had the burger...a huge angus/Kobe burger that was very filling. It came with duck fat fried fries. Burger was very moist and delicious.I had no idea I could open my mouth that wide, the burger was so big....but I persevered.  One person ordered the blackened salmon on a bed of lentils. She said the salmon was cooked perfectly and was very spicy. She loved it. One person ordered the steak. It was cooked perfectly and she ate every piece of it (it was a fairly lean cut)  Dessert Chocolate almond cake. OMG....so good !  Our male server was excellent. He continually dropped by during our meal....super attentive.  Lunch with app, main course and dessert was $23. Worth every penny.   I'll definitely go back"}
{"text":"An overdue review by many years. I have been to Freds for Summerlicious & Winterlicious and the experience has always been great.  They have a wicked Seafood Paella & their portions  of food are generous .The  range of options from starter to dessert is wide which makes it easy to bring groups of friends with varied eating preferences. As a foodie you must do a licious here at some time in your foodie life   My favourite dishes have been the duck confit with  pesto gnocchi, and the steak. Freds does steak really well and  some dishes come with duck fat frites which are worth ordering again on the side"}
{"text":"On my recent visit to Toronto, my work friends took me here for Lunch. I ordered the 2 course lunch special. I had the lobster crab bisque to start with. It was pretty good as most folks have noted.  The real surprise came when my Thai style vegatable curry came. Now just to clear something up, I am a meat and potatoes kinda guy. It was one of those rare days when I didnt feel like having meat. I am so glad I had this dish. It was just a perfect blend of spices with coconut milk and basil. The vegetables were done perfectly, not too soogy. I could not believe how much I enjoyed this dish. I like Thai food and can easily say this curry was one of the best I have ever had.  Now a few days later, I find myself craving that delicious vegetable curry and thought the only thing I can do is Yelp about it :)"}
{"text":"Price: 3/5, about $30 per person for summerlicious Food: 3/5, an OK Environment: 2/5, not that fancy. I don't think it worth the summerlicious price.  My friend and I went here for summerlicious. I don't find this place very fancy and I don't find the food here very good. The famous lobster soup tastes ok, it looks fancy, but taste is not as good as it looks. The lobster pasta was ok. The desert was just costco cake, maybe even worse than costco. They definitely did not make it in house. Portion is small as well. I would not come here for food like this on regular price."}
{"text":"Only ever been here during Winterlicious, but it's so delicious I come back! Their lobster bisque soup is very taste and the bread on top is soft yet flaky like croissant. Definitely recommend! Nice ambience too."}
{"text":"In Short: Horrible experience, Came for winterlicious 2017 dinner 38$ per person, plus 12$ per person wine. 2 of us. Food is falsely advertised, does not taste to what is promised. Save your money and go literally anywhere else.  It was so bad I made a yelp account to tell others not to have the same experience I did.   Server/Host:  Server was lovely and sweet, and made sure refill water etc. No complaints whatsoever. Host or owner? An angry man who seemed annoyed more than anything when we showed up for our reservation. Very abrupt and rude in the way he talked.   Environment:  Dim lit restaurant which is common, but the art thats painted on the walls is just atrocious. It looks like Dantes Inferno (literally) with lots of red tones and strange landscapes. As well weird depictions of a naked venus lady with a boombox, and then a random arch of a blue beach in the middle. Honestly a huge eyesore that I didn't think would bother me as much as it did. Also the restaurant is shared between 2. So when you walk in Freds not here is upstairs and another one is downstairs.   Food: Obviously the most important:  Starter: Cold butter, cold bread. Come on I've worked as caterer and its not that difficult to leave bread and butter out at room temperature. Or you know have fresh bread thats not hard.  Appetiser: \"Famous\" lobster bisque has no taste of lobster, it just smells fishy and is plain. They must just poach lobster in water and use that water in the bisque if anything. Large puff pastry on top which makes it look pretty but the taste is plain.  2 Main: I got the lamb. As in 3 thin chops not cooked properly, one was medium, two was medium rare, oh and cold when it arrived. It was poorly seasoned with large peppercorns. Came with side of cous cous with no flavour to it, only salt and pepper and a side of \"curry\" mashed up veggies that in all honesty tasted like baby food. Friend got a steak and side of veggies and \"duck fat\"  fries. Steak was cooked great and veggies were crispy (Its not that hard though to not screw up a steak). The fries were a sham for promotion, I've had numerous duck fat fries at different restaurants pre-winterlicious and during. These were cold, thin, and wilted. They had no duck fat whatsoever, honestly McDonalds would have been better.  Drinks: Both of us had chianti wine which was great and true to its region. Dessert: Cheesecake and Rumcake. Small portion, cheesecake was sweet and light and tasty, rumcake was doughy and did not taste nice. It was edible but it wasn't good.   Price: 38$ per person, 12$ per glass of wine. Total bill 120ish$ with tax. NOT worth the price whatsoever. You can find such better quality food in so many better places in Toronto for that price and less!    Conclusion: Food wasn't any good or special. The ingredients they said they used were a lie or not prepared properly at all. This place is just trying to make a buck off winterlicious. I didn't end up taking any photos which I regret because I wish I could show you how sad our plates looked."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews about awful service, I was a bit nervous about coming here especially because I was taking my parents and knowing Asian parents, it's a little hard to please them. However, our server for the night was more than just okay, he was super attentive and so nice, rockstar attitude! My parents felt homey and comfortable and we were amazed by the portions of our food. For starter we all had the crab soup and it was a perfect blend of spices; the baked pastry was an excellent addition to the flavours and was thoroughly enjoyed.   My mom had the seafood pasta, but the noodles weren't fully cooked. She complained about them being too hard, which was quite unfortunate. My dad got the steak and frites and he seemed to enjoy it immensely. For myself, I got the slow roasted angus beef which came in a HUGE portion. I could not finish even half of it. The mashed potatoes were a little stale for my liking but otherwise okay.   For dessert, my parents got the cheesecake. They complained about it being too sweet for their liking but praised the set overall. For myself I got the chocolate torte which was not bad, it wasn't too sweet surprisingly.   To finish, they gave us each a $25 gift card to use after winterlicious. Overall a nice experience."}
{"text":"This place will always be a \"Meh\" in my book. I first tried it a few years ago and it wasn't a good dining experience. Our waiter was ignorant, moody, and borderline b*tchy (did I mention it was a MALE waiter?) The service was so bad that I can't even remember how the food tasted. This year, I decided to give it another chance after a couple of my girlfriends convinced me that it's a good dining place and it's one of their favorites. So I went back for the Winterlicious event with my boyfriend.   I ordered the Lobster soup (obviously), Lobster Tail fettuccine, and the Belgian choco mousse cake for dessert because they ran out of the mixed berry shortcake I originally wanted (my dining experience started to decline at this point). The boyfriend ordered Grilled calamari stuffed w/ risotto, Rib eye steak, and tiramisu for dessert (they misspelled tiramisu as \"tiramusi\" on the menu, which was such a turn off). I also ordered their special cocktail for the event, called Cabana. It tasted like a fruit punch. WHERE'S THE VODKA?!?!?!?!  1. Appetizers: I have to admit that their Lobster soup was yummy. It's the best part of my sub-par dining experience. My boyfriend's stuffed calamari was also good and the portion was quite generous.   2. Main entrees: My lobster tail was quite big and grilled to perfection. The only thing I disliked about my main was the fettuccine. I like my pasta well done and it was al dente. It's just my personal preference and it's definitely not their fault. My boyfriend asked for a medium rare rib eye and when it came, he thought it was more of a medium to medium-well. Anyways, it was still a good piece of steak. My only itch about his dish was the veggie side. They used bokchoy out of all the greens out there! Believe me, I love my bokchoy, but NOT with steaks. It's like pairing BBQ pork with arugula. How do you like that?   3. Desserts: I was still upset that they ran out of the mixed berry shortcake and didn't have a fruity-type dessert as a replacement. I couldn't really enjoy the chocolate mousse cake because my first two dishes were already very creamy. I swapped my dessert with my boyfriend's tiramusi (haha!) and I definitely preferred that over the mousse cake. In the end, we didn't finish our dessert because the overall dining experience was just... underwhelming.  A couple of things worth mentioning: - Our waiter was nice, attentive, but not annoying. - I noticed that a couple of other tables had some issues with their main courses. The guy beside us didn't finish his steak (1/2 of it was still on the plate) and when the waitress asked whether or not he would like to pack up the rest, he said no. THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN. Another table complained about one of the steaks being tough (overcooked?) and asked if they could get a replacement. The waitress tried to defend herself by saying that the steak looked overcooked because of the dim lighting in the restaurant. WTH?!? The patron said it was tough! She didn't even say it looked overcooked, she already tasted it before she complained! Oh boy...   Anyway, I wouldn't go back to this place. Well, maybe for the Lobster soup. MAYBE. That's all, folks! :)"}
{"text":"If it wasn't for Summerlicious I would probably never have known about Fred's Not Here. I decided to hold my boyfriend's surprise birthday dinner here yesterday evening. I called way ahead of time to reserve a table for the group of 17 people that showed up yesterday. I expected our table to be ready for 7:30 pm but it wasn't. The group had to wait outside for about 10 minutes until our table was ready.  The service was non-existent as soon as our water was poured into our glasses. If my boyfriend's friend didn't go up and ask for our server we would probably be waiting even longer. I ordered the grilled calamari with chorizo sausage as my appetizer, lobster and mussel with linguini as my entree, and the creme brûlée cheesecake for my dessert. I thought everything was alright but nothing that blew me out of the water. $35 for a 3-course meal was a really good deal compared to their daily menu! However, drinks were expensive and a 18% gratuity was added to our bill because of our group. I ordered a coke and it was $3.49! That is insane. I bought a whole case for that price!  Would I dine here again? Not really sure..."}
{"text":"I've been to Fred's not here a few times with friends and family. My last visit was pretty good. It's got a nice scenery there, great place to go right before you hit the Mirvish Theatre across the street. I ordered the steak as my main course and loved it, it had flavour and was cooked the way I wanted: medium rare. I had a food coma right after with the amount of delicious food I had lol."}
{"text":"I decided to take advantage of the Summerlicious Special and check out Fred's for Dinner.  The restaurant itself looks a bit dated but it still succeeds in evoking that romantic feeling with it's deep red and black murals boarding both walls and white linen draped tables complete with candle light and dim ambiance. There is an open kitchen in the back of the restaurant that allows you to view the chefs hard at work.  Our waiter began by taking our drink orders. I was intrigued by the various flavours of San Pellegrino they offer and decided to order the Pompelmo (Grapefruit) flavour. It's delightfully tart and refreshing. I was surprised though when my table mate ordered a gingerale and it arrived in a can with separate glass?  After placing our order the waiter returns with a basket of assorted bread containing a dark rye, white, and jalapeno cornbread. The cornbread was soo delicious, good balance of a sweet and spice. The waiter noticed how fast we devoured it and brought us another basket of just cornbread.  We also decided to order an app off the regular menu. I love crab cakes and try to sample them wherever I dine so here was no exception.  Maryland Style Crab Cake w/ Blue Crab & Chipotle Remoulade - Nicely browned, visible chunks of crab, loved the spicy remoulade and the accompanying black bean & corn salsa.  Onto the Summerlicious Menu  Lobster & Crab Soup - Quite possibly the BEST soup i've ever taste. I was expecting a creamy soup with chunks of meat in it but it was more of a rich broth based soup which I much more prefer. The flavour of lobster and crab was mild however the broth was soo flavourful and made for a great base to break the golden brown puff pastry baked right onto the bowl into. Practically everyone in the restaurant ordered this despite the 40 degree weather outside.  Wood Grilled \"California Cut\" New York Sirloin Steak with Mixed Garlic Mushrooms & Duck Fat Frites - I ordered my steak medium rare however I felt it was just slightly overcooked. The meat itself was a nice thick cut with good charring and that distinct wood fire flavour. The ample portion of duck fat frites was a nice surprise. You could definitely detect the flavour of the oil in the soft thin golden frites.  Belgian Double Chocolate Mousse Cake - The cake was surprisingly small, more of a miniature version of a mousse cake however I was overly stuffed at this point and welcomed the smaller portion. It was your average chocolate mousse cake with a chocolate sponge bottom, followed by a dark chocolate mousse layer than a milk chocolate mousse layer and topped with fudge sauce. Simple and delicious.  I'd have to say our Summerlicious experience at Fred's was worth every penny. For $35 bucks I felt overwhelmingly satisfied and stuffed. Definitely make reservations, I noticed by 7pm every single table in the restaurant was full. Our waiter was very attentive and helpful despite how busy the restaurant was that evening and we never felt neglected. Food came out at perfect timing, hot, and accompanied with great service.  FYI Bathrooms are located downstairs and shared with sister restaurant The Red Tomato which is also located downstairs."}
