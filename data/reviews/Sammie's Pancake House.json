{"text":"The food is average.  I went for breakfast to give it a try.  The atmosphere is what got me.  There is this depressing feel to the place.  It was very outdated on the inside and there was only one tired waitress that was trying to work the enitire place.  Even she was depressed.  I didn't feel like I wanted to hang around and chat after the meal like ususal when you go out.  You just want to eat and leave.  I don't know if I would go back.  I am still debating."}
{"text":"Another good breakfast place in a town a little short of such.  I usually get the standard bacon, eggs and grits.  My son orders off the kids menu and likes the little pizza.  The coffee is not as good as at Illini Grill, but they do a good job of keeping your cup filled."}
