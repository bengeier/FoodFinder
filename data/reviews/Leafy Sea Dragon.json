{"text":"So I went to Zen Nights in Gilbert on Friday night and was excited to see Leafy Sea Dragon was there! The line was huge, but well worth the wait. I was a little sad to see they had sold out of onion rings, but decided to give the tostones and seitan quesadilla a try.  They were both really good, prices weren't too bad either. The tostones were perfectly crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside. The dipping sauce wasn't real flavorful but it was good. The seitan quesadilla could've easily been mistaken for meat. It was spicy and flavorful, very satisfying. I hope to come across this food truck again because I really wanted to try the avocado tomato grilled cheese."}
{"text":"So good!! We got the seitan quesadilla, onion rings, and tostones tonight at Food Truck Friday (west side). It was amazingly delicious and filling. Not sure what is in the sauce they make, but it's seriously the best. You can tell when people care about what they do, and the service here reflects that. Thanks all!"}
{"text":"It took me a while to try Leafy Sea Dragon because their menu seemed to have a heavy cheese-based theme, and I never ate cheese, even in my pre-vegan years. But they were at Zen Nights yestereve, so I decided to try a few things.  SEITAN QUESADILLA $8 - Ordered \"sin queso,\" meaning without cheese, but there was a mix-up and I was given cheese. The man who took my order thought I meant no quesadilla sauce. One bite and I knew... So I returned them and they made a fresh batch for me, sin queso. No harm, no foul.  The seitan is seasoned perfectly. The spicy house quesadilla sauce was an excellent addition and did not taste \"cheesy\" at all.  Awesome dish. I'd order it again!   ROSEMARY TOFU SCRAMBLE HASH $5 - I ordered this as a bowl, and DD ordered it as a burrito. I demand to know with what sorcery this was made! Best tofu scramble, ever! The blending of ingredients, the seasonings, the freshness, and the dab of chili sauce atop all left me wanting more!  ONION RINGS $5 - I don't know what the order originally contained because it appeared that DD had eaten 1/2 of them before they ever got to me (That's the last time I'll send her to retrieve my order! jk), so my picture is post DD's attack. I don't blame her though. They must have had some leftover magic from the tofu scramble and put it into the onion rings. I swear, these are like the best onion rings I have ever had.  And I don't know what sauce was put on the side, but it was the perfect dipping sauce.   Food trucks sometimes get a bad name, but Leafy Sea Dragon is more like a bad-ass vegan restaurant on wheels. Delicious vegan comfort food. Affordable prices. Leaves you wanting more! I'll be tracking them down from now on!"}
