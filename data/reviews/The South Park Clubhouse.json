{"text":"Based off of previous reviews, I actually avoided this place. Until a group of friends decided to go here. I have to say I was not at all disappointed. The wings are fantastic, both boneless and bone in. Ordered the quesadilla as an appetizer and it was huge. I was extremely pleased with the taste as well. Can't beat the everyday $8 Bud Light pitchers either.   I went again a second time just to be sure and again, I was very satisfied. Service was friendly, food was quick, and overall a great experience. The bar inside is huge and offers plenty of TVs for sporting events.   I will likely be regular based off of my the first couple experiences and anyone who is visiting me outside of Pittsburgh, I will be sure to bring them here."}
{"text":"They took the prime rib sandwich off the menu, the only reason we ever went there. They say they \"change the menu\" every so often, but they can add to it without taking away one of their most popular items. There is no point of going now."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time with my wife and son, it was as expected. Great food, good atmosphere and reasonable prices. Fast and friendly service, what else can you ask for. I would highly recommend coming here if you never been here!"}
{"text":"I went to this establishment for the first time over the weekend. I had 1 order of wings which were good, and 3 beers, and my total was over $50. OK, i did order a seasonal beer, and was well aware of how expensive it is to purchase, but when the markup is well over 100% I believe that is outrageous. I had expected it to be no more than $11 or 12 a bottle, imagine my surprise when I got my bill and I had paid $16 a bottle. I will not return to this establishment just because of this, I understand needing to make a profit, but this is just robbery. I know I can buy a case of what I drank for $83 a case meaning each bottle would cost me $6.92 each(12 bottles to a case), and I am sure since they buy product in bulk they get an even better price than I do at the distributor."}
{"text":"Held a wedding rehearsal dinner here for 18 people. The room is perfect for smaller gatherings and was clean and the tables were set up nicely.  The room was a bit dark, but this actually was ok with us.  We had prime rib, stuffed chicken and pecan crusted tilapia on the menu - along with red skinned potatoes, green beans and broccoli.  Soft drinks, rolls and salad were included.  The meal was served on time, and we had a dedicated server to attend to our needs.  He was superb.  Since we did not include alcohol, he was perfectly happy running tabs for our guests and kept drinks filled.    The stuffed chicken was the group's favorite.  It was delicious.  The tilapia was also very good, and the potatoes were scrumptious.  There was plenty of food for everyone - we even took home leftovers - and some people had two helpings of everything.  The only criticism I have was the prime rib.  It was a bit overcooked and tough.  In defense of the facility, prime rib is difficult to keep warm in steamers - and as such, we understood.    I would not hesitate to use this facility again, and would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice and reasonably priced venue for smaller gatherings.  We were treated excellently!  In the future, we'd skip the prime rib and add a different meat from their ample catering menu.  Excellent place - easy to make reservations - great staff - delicious food - ample parking...what can I say but KUDOS!!!"}
{"text":"Very good place to watch a game and get some great food. The menu has a huge variety and it is also reasonably priced. The food was good and so was the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd time here. We gave it a 2nd chance. I can't express to you how frustrating your experience will be, in this restaurant. Poor management trickles down to untrained and unprofessional bartenders.   If you drink Coors Light draft, you'll be right at home. That's all they can handle.   Overall Grade: F-"}
{"text":"Our service was good. I will start with that. Unfortunately, that's where the good review stops. I ordered the grilled salmon which was a frozen piece of salmon that was cooked too long. It was mediocre at best. Is it sad that the gravy on my mashed potatoes was the best part of the meal and I am fairly certain it was from a jar. The bar area is a very nice looking place to enjoy a cocktail. The dining area seemed to be bright and open, similar to a cafeteria. Apparently the men's bathroom looks like it hasn't been cleaned since this place opened up since both of the men with us commented. I don't see this place being in business for much longer."}
{"text":"I had been here a couple of times before but it had been awhile and now I remember why we stopped going.  The food is only okay and the service is horrible.  I should have known something was wrong when there was no wait and the dining room was half empty on a Friday night.  Our appetizer was served without the side of ranch we requested and without any plates.  While waiting for the waitress to come back so we could ask for plates, the main dishes were served so now we had a table full of food but no plates.  We did ask the food runner for plates and the missing ranch and eventually they were brought.    The steak hoagie did not come with any dressing or mayo on it so it was very dry.  The fish hoagie also did not come with any tarter sauce.  It was just fried fish and an enormous bun. We had finished the steak hoagie and I ate my half of the fish sandwich with ketchup before we flagged down another waitress to ask her to bring us tarter sauce.   Our waitress asked \"you guys ready for your check\" as she walked past the table. Then a few minutes later she put the check on the table again as she walked past.  We needed a to-go box for the appetizer we didn't get to eat and figured the only way to get it was to not pay the check until the waitress actually stopped and paid a tiny bit of attention to us.   When she finally brought the box, we paid the check in cash as to not have to wait for her to decide to bring back my card.   Too long, didn't read... We had to ask for plates. We had to ask for ranch. We had to ask for tarter sauce. We had to ask for to-go box.  Most that we had to ask other waitresses for as ours was missing most of the time. We never got refills on our drinks."}
{"text":"No wander we stopped coming here. One server on, 20 minutes for nachos, cold \"hot roast beef\" sandwiches and our server didn't check back for 15-20 minutes for us to even tell her. The \"manager\" was rude, no apology, and talked about us to a girl at the bar after we told her our sandwiches were cold. She bought her check but at this point, we will never go again. Ever..."}
{"text":"Very poor experience.  Sat for 15 minutes (during a dead time of day with.only about 8 customer in the whole place) and waited just to get a menu.   Then, took another 15 minutes just to get an order in.  Bartender sat and talked to other customers while I waited 15 minutes for him to get my order.  Finally ordered.  Food came out ok,but it wasn't much for what you pay.   Battened never checked back once or refilled my drink as he was too busy talking to other patrons in 15 minute increments.  Same thing happened when he dropped of my check...waited another 15 minutes.  Pathetic service.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"When Jesus walked on water, he was actually walking on the club house's ranch dressing.   Food needs updated and improved upon. Not much else to say. People are nice but that only goes so far when you actually want to eat a meal."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Tried a couple times and both times were big fails. Food was very mediocre and bland."}
{"text":"We've been going here for about 3 years now, always have been delighted with the consistently good quality of the food. But it seems recently the service quality has degraded continuously.   We were seated rather quickly but the waitress took awhile to come see us. Didn't bother to introduce herself or seemed interested in serving at all because we rarely dealt with her the rest of the night. Another server, a bus-boy and even what appeared to be the manager all helped deliver the food and serve us instead. Very bizarre and somewhat unprofessional. We had an appetizer of the spinach artichoke dip and I went for a Buffalo Chicken Wrap. The food quality was really quite nice but the service was virtually non-existent. To make matters worse, when I visited the restroom, the same girl that was supposed to be serving was chatting with her friends instead. That's probably the one thing I disliked the most, and as a result it reflected in the tip we paid her. You cannot expect a fair tip if you're not even interested in doing your job."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service and the food is mediocre on a good day. I won't be coming back to this establishment any longer. Bathrooms are dirty and never cleaned here. Outrageous prices too. This place in my opinion is just flat out unacceptable, and I bet will be out of business soon based on the above complaints."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I was a little nervous to visit this spot after reading the yelp reviews. But my boyfriend was adamant on trying it out, so we came here on Friday night. The place was packed! Being that there was a Friday night and there was a penguins game, this was to be expected. We waited about 25 minutes for a table. The hostesses were very nice and seated us as quickly as they could. We also requested to be in the bar area so we could have a better view of the game, and they were happy to accommodate. Now, don't come here and expect a gourmet meal. It's a typical Pittsburgh bar food scene. Expect that, and you won't be disappointed. My boyfriend had a burger and fries with a side salad and enjoyed his food. We also split the mozzarella stick appetizer which was tasty. I ordered the hot buffalo boneless wings with fries and they were good as well. We didn't have alcohol, just some waters and iced tea and our total was $35. It seemed a little steep for mediocre bar food, but it wasn't super overpriced. Our server was friendly and did well for how busy it was. I was the most impressed by the hostesses, who I observed walking around, when it had slowed down, checking on the tables to see if anyone needed another drink, or needed assistance with anything else. I always appreciate great customer service and hard working employees. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves and will probably return again for a game."}
{"text":"In as little detail as I can say, the service is terrible the three girls behind the bar have no clue they are at work. The other issue if you are not I guess a regular you don't get \" normal service\". If any at all. Walking by my drink glass four time while empty and Making eye contact with me n my glass then continue to walk by without asking if I want another one. Then I order a chicken quesadilla...there was zero taste it didn't taste good it didn't taste bad it taste like nothing. Get you stuff and your kitchen together. Last trip there till something changes. Two thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Service was poor and food was decent at best. There are many better places around the area to go."}
{"text":"Nice sports bar in the burbs.    I grew up in the South Hills and have seen this location transition between a various number of restaurants.  I remember it as the South Park Inn, a Country Western Bar, some other location, I also remember it burning down.  After the variety of different places it has been, I think the South Park Club House is a place that will stick.  The place has been completely rebuilt and everything is clean, nice, and new on the inside.  There is a fairly large bar area with about 10-15 TV's surrounding it.  There is also a separate dining area which still has TVs.  There is also a small arcade area that is good for kids (I believe they host birthday parties here occasionally).    The food is standard pub grub and is decent...nothing to write home about but completely acceptable food for a sports bar setting.  The bar is nice and has a pretty good beer selection for the area.  Last time I was there they had East End, Bell's, Victory, and a few others crafts on draft in addition to the standard macros.    Overall, this is a good spot to catch a game, grab some grub, and have a beer.  The options of nice places to do this in the area are fairly limited so given the location it is a top notch place.    It has become my go-to spot when I am in town."}
{"text":"Wedding soup was good, I didn't care for something that I  ordered and they took it off my bill without even asking.   Boneless wings were good and the staff was nice"}
{"text":"I think we are done here (and I've only been here a total of 3 times). The last time I ate here I had the gyro sandwich (probably my own fault for ordering that here) but the \"meat\" tasted like what I would imagine steakums tastes like (I've never had it so I wouldn't really know), very dry and bland. It did not taste entirely right going down and it was much less enjoyable when it made the return trip up later that night. Fries were also cold but we never even saw our server to say anything. Also, a well's banana bread beer was $7.50?! Nowhere is price marked for their drafts but I have had this and several high-alcohol content IPAs at places much closer to Pittsburgh and have not paid $7.50. Since the food has pretty much been a waste of time here, I think when I am out towards the direction of my boyfriend's house in the future that we will patronize establishments that don't always result in a consistently bad experience."}
{"text":"We had my mothers 80th birthday party here today. The staff could not have been nicer. We used their party room. They had fresh veggies with dip out, plus chicken nuggets with sauces. Everyone raved about the chicken.  Then they brought out salads and rolls with softened butter shaped like flowers.  Then they brought the buffet food in. Stuffed chicken breast (very good),  beef in sauce (just ok, tasted like BBQ sauce), roasted red potatoes (delicious),  and green beans ( good).  What set them apart was the service. The staff just made the day very nice. Thanks South Park Clubhouse!  We'll be back to try the regular menu :)"}
{"text":"I haven't been there in a while and now I know why. Don't take your American Express. But the food was mediocre at best. Can't believe how downhill they went."}
{"text":"After sitting for about ten minutes our server finally greeted us. She didn't have clue what the vegetable of the day was which isn't a huge deal but ... two strikes. Food took a while, understandable because they were busy...but when the food came my husband's food was cold. It was fish and we didn't want to chance food poisoning. They basically reheated the fish they made him and the manager stopped by and said \"what was wrong with it? Is it better now? K sorry.\" They didn't offer to comp the cold fish nor was the apology genuine. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I ate there last night with my parents.  Their food has gone downhill.  They use to cut thier own fries....not anymore.  Everything we ordered was frozen 5 minutes prior.   You can get the same quality meal by simply going in your freezer.  Unfortunately, it's time to say goodbye to this place."}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent, staff was friendly and courteous, though the place was pretty crowded for a Pens game.  I felt there was definitely room to be made in the bar area, but the staff didn't seem too eager to bother with it, so they sat us in the restaurant part.  Not a big deal, we were still able to watch the game on a large screen and they had the sound on, too.  Decent beer selection.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the wings and Reuben here.  It's a great place for the family.  I have also came to watch the Pens and have a drink.  Service can get backed up but if you get there on a night that it isn't packed the service is fast.  Everyone is very friendly.  They have an arcade but almost all the games are broken."}
{"text":"Another fantastic meal.... This place is awesome man!   Great food, great service, A+ every time!!  If I were on death row, and had one choice for a last meal, it would be here... No lie....  This place is the best..  I wish they were open on Thanksgiving"}
