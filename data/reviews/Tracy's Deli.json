{"text":"THEY OVER CHARGE YOU STAY AWAY!!!  I called and asked how much it would be for SIX of there buffalo wings. I was told that the price would be 6 dollars and seventy some odd cents, which I thought was reasonable so I placed my order and asked for a side of blue cheese. She lady on the phone asked if I would like to INCLUDE A TIP, and I replied that I would once the driver got there. So when the driver came he asked me to sign the receipt. The total said $8.99!!!  which I thought was a bit PRICEY for 6 WING DINGS. The driver stated that he had ANOTHER DELIVERY to make so to called the store. The first THREE TIMES I called no one answered. I figure it was because the DRIVER called the store to inform them of my DISSATISFACTION. So when the women answered the phone I inquired about the EXTRA CHARGES. She told me that it was the taxes, then .50 cents for the BLUE CHEESE, .50 cents TO USE MY CARD, and $1 FOR THE DELIVERY (they are only about 2 BLOCKS AWAY ON THE SAME STEET mind you). I told her it would of been NICE if she had told me about all the EXTRA CHARGES when I ordered. The lady became RUDE and ARRAGANT so to avoid the ARGUMENT she was trying to start I told her she did not have to worry about receiving MY business again.  So I did the MATH MYSELF and that's NOT EVEN TRUE because if those charges were CORRECT then my total would have been around $9.25. Like why would I have to pay extra for blue cheese and why would she ask me if I wanted to include a tip when they already charge a delivery fee. So after I did all this I went to eat my 6 HIGH PRICED WING DINGS and guess what they were not even GOOD. So if you were considering ordering from here DONT because they will make up charges if they think they could get away with it. They probably NEED to do this to because they probably DONT GET VERY MANY CUSTOMERS. If I could give this place a NEGATIVE RATING I would."}

{"text":"Breakfast has always been a hit and today we ordered lunch.  I ordered a plain steak hoagie with just cheese- simple.. what was delivered was smothered in mayo - let and tomato.. the steak was drowning in mayo.    I raved about the breakfast but not too thrilled with the lunch order.. accuracy should be #1.   There was never any issues before. Now I am left with a steak hoagie that is smothered in mayo that I did not order.  Stars are brought down today from 4 to 3."}
{"text":"Awesome fish sandwiches. I don't know about anything else because they're so damn good that's all I've ever had."}
