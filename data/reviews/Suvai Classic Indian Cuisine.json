{"text":"FOOD: a good selection of flavourful indian food. Large enough quantities to share. 3 of us ordered 2 mains with some (delicious!) naan. The mini-samosas are a must!

SERVICE: we were the only customers in for lunch that day, so service was very attentive! Only one guy was working at the time, which would be worrisome if there were more customers. 

COST: About $10 to $15 for a main dish. No lunch sizes though... 

OVERALL: A hidden gem in downtown oakville! A little hard to find, and street parking is near impossible (there is, however, a paid parking lot one street north on Church St), but well worth the search."}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food! I had a soup for appetizer, which was a lentil and vegetable soup. Main course Butter Chicken which was very tasty! The chicken was perfectly cooked. I almost always leave with a take away bag but this time just a very full stomach. I sat at the front table right by the window, a perfect people watching spot over lakeshore. I was really impressed and will definitely be returning with family and friends."}
{"text":"SERVICE: Highly disappointed as we read positive reviews here. Ordered takeout and was told that it would be ready in 30 min. We arrived an HOUR later and it still was NOT ready. The owner and another server fumbled around with our order for well over 10 min after our arrival before we left with our takeout. There were only 2 other families and one more person taking out so this shows you how incompetent they are.

FOOD: I specifically ordered very spicy butter chicken and got something that was rather mild. You can get a lot better at Bombay Grill in Burlington or Nirvana in Mississauga. And the prices are ridiculously high. You've got to be too rich or lacking in Indian food knowledge to enjoy this place.

AMBIENCE: Dark and dinghy. Not very spacious. But the view out towards the front is definitely enjoyable.

LOCATION: Nice locality. Obviously the clientele is very Caucasian and very wealthy. Don't expect free parking unless its a sunday.

OVERALL: don't bother unless you are rich and not well versed in Indian food."}

We love Indian food (hey, we're Indian) so when we saw a wagjag for an Indian joint in Oakville, we jumped on it. We ordered 4 vouchers worth $100 total. 

First visit we made reservations for dine-in. First thing of note is that it is in an upstairs unit and not accessible. Stroller? Wheelchair? Forget about it. We were the only people there. This was a good thing because it was very difficult to balance our food on the tiny table so we used other tables and chairs to keep our food that wouldn't fit on the table. It was nice sitting at the table but very cramped. In fact, the whole restaurant is quite crammed. 

Staff were friendly and responsive. Portions were quite small. I ordered the masala dosa. For $10.99 I was expecting epic dosa. It was half the size of a dosa you'd get at any dosa hut for 8.99 and with half the filling. Very disappointed. Taste was decent for the 60 seconds it lasted. Overpriced? Yep. But a quick drive of the neighborhood gives you an idea of the demographic which makes a lot of sense. If you're rich and aren't used to authentic Indian cuisine, you could expect a decent meal here. Not that the food isn't authentic, it's just not as awesome as what you could get in Mississauga or Toronto or even Burlington (Bombay Grill - FREAKIN YUM)

Second visit, we ordered take out. We were told over the phone that it would be ready in 30 minutes. We arrived there a full hour later. It wasn't ready. When we got in, there was one other person waiting for take-out and one family seated in the restaurant. The owner and other staff member appeared quite overwhelmed and asked repeatedly for our names and what we ordered. They placed items in bags, then took them out, replaced them, juggling between our order and the other person's order. When it was all said and done, we got the right items in our order but it took well over 10 minutes. In that time only one other couple arrived at the restaurant for dine in. There wasn't much to handle but it appeared very overwhelming to them.

The food was ok. Hubby wasn't happy with his. Mine was nice and flavourful but very salty. 

Naans are VERY large but not all that great. 

We genuinely wonder how this place is able to stay open."}
