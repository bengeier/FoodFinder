{"text":"This place by far has the best food and service. I went to the other restaurants for years and will never go back. The andele tacos are THE BEST!"}
{"text":"1st time customer.....Great Place!  Good service, even better food, very authentic.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Mexican food I've ever had!  They are really reasonable on their prices and have great specials (including drink specials!)  The servers are always really sweet and helpful to explain anything on the menu.  They also have a decent crowd for soccer matches and a nice covered outdoor seating area.  They aren't blasting mariachi music so loud you have to scream at the person across the table from you. Their mango margarita may be the best drink I've ever had!  They have karaoke some nights and draw a great crowd but you can also pretty much have the restaurant to yourself in the afternoons (soccer time!)"}
{"text":"It was super tasty. I wanted authentic for my birthday. We had a party of 12 and our server was great, so attentive to our many needs. 

I chose the place based on other yelp reviews, and the food did not disappoint. I am also very sensitive to cheap ingredients- I often have a list going of restaurants that send me running to the bathroom and restaurants I can tolerate :) I felt great after my dinner! My one complaint, and I will not dock stars for this because it is simply a matter of preference, by two salsa options were beyond spicy!!! Way too spicy to enjoy. Mild salsa had zero kick. I wish there was something in the middle. My family also complained that their pico de gallo was too spicy to eat. Hey, it is a Mexican restaurant, I appreciated the authenticity. I also think we were the only white family there, so you know it's good stuff when the people who know authentic Mexican food choose to eat there. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!

If you're ever in Concord and feeling in a fiesta mood, this is the place to go.  You get three kinds of salsa brought out!  So if you're not familar with them make sure you ask, because one of them is really hot!  

The food comes out so quick that you barely have time to start eating your chips and salsa.  

Good Service and reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Hands-down, the BEST Mexican restaurant in the Concord/Harrisburg/University area! We have been frequenting Andele for a few years now and continue to have a great experience on every visit. 

As is customary, you receive fresh chips when you arrive but Andele sets themselves apart by giving you 3 different salsas (traditional mild red, a medium roasted brown, and a green hot jalapeño). All 3 are delicious! But be wary of the green one if you don't like spicy! The menu is large but you can't go wrong with anything on there. The Enchiladas Rojas (if you prefer very spicy food), the Super Fajita Quesadilla, and the Sopa de Pollo are a few of my favorites. Everything is hot, fresh and large portion sizes. 

Lastly, the staff is exceptional! Every hostess, server and bartender is friendly and attentive. The general manager/owner is almost always present, and is sure to check in with every customer to ask about their experience. 

Visit Andele and you'll never frequent another Mexican restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner here because of the yelp reviews.  Food is very good and authentic.  They give you three types of salsa with your tortillas - reg, hot, and green tomato.  I had the grilled taco...they give you three...very fresh.  Our family loved it.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Authentic fare. If it isn't on the menu, they'll make it for you. Great prices. Great food. Eat there 2 to 3 times a month over the last year."}
{"text":"I don't see how you could have a bad experience coming to Andele. My family of four goes there at least once a week, and we have never had anything less than a great experience. Ordering mixed drinks can turn out disappointing, but I can live with that for the service and food they excel at. For those complaining that their food wasn't warm enough, or they didn't get the service they thought they were entitled to, usually it's because they're miserable people anyways and just want somethings to bitch about, which is why they have an ungodly amount of reviews. I felt compelled to write this review because literally, while we were sitting at the table eating last night, I thought \"This is a restaurant and owner that deserves positive recognition\". Because I can honestly say it is one of the best dining experiences every time we go."}
{"text":"Errrmahguuurrrd sooooo good!!! I'm going to poop with a smile on my face. We had flaioiotas and grilled cheese burritos.  So good. I can dies now and be ok!!"}
{"text":"This is the only Mexican restaurant that I will eat at.  I love the different salsa's, the food is fabulous and the family is amazing.  We try to eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"This is my choice for local Mexican fare.  My family has eaten lunch and dinner here quite a few times and each time the food has been fresh and delicious...more so than most of the other Mexican-style restaurants in the area.  The salsas that they bring to the table are some of the best that I have tasted and range from mild to very hot."}
{"text":"Excellent.   Our \"go to\" Mexican spot.   Maybe not perfect atmosphere, but quick service and good food.  3 salsa's and chips at your table before your know it.   Nice price on DosEquis amber draft.  I like the Chori-Pollo or Pollo al Chipotle.   Yum!"}
{"text":"I didn't want to give 1 star but for how much we paid..yes!!! We baught alot of food..5 tortas..1 burrito..5 sopes (expensive) 5 aguas de pina...all costed $95.78 and I counted myself and it should have came to 56.78 we was ripped off..food was nasty..the torta bread was really wet not hardly any food in it..the burrito was suggy..the aguas de pina..didn't taste like pina (pineapple) and the supes almost $3 for one and the fries with the tortas hard and cold...I wanted to go back and take the food back and complain but my brother said forget it we just won't go back...I was so disappointed the amount we paid and I know how mexican food should taste..I'm mexican and I cook better then this restaurant...not happy:( waste of food and money.."}
{"text":"Amazing margaritas, great food and dedicated owner to the business. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Best tacos and salsa in town!! There are other good mex restaurants but this is the most authentic, from the staff to the food to the soccer on the tv's. Make your own salsa combo they bring to your table is the best!!"}
{"text":"The food here used to be great food, but seems to have gone downhill recently.  I have been going here for many years. I recently had a poor experience here related to a waiter. A male waiter took our cash and never returned with our change.  After taking our money he never so much as made eye contact.  We went to the cashier to get our change.  It was obvious that both people  never intended for us to have our change, and just ignored us hoping we would leave and he would get an undeserved tip.  We also never received a receipt after we finally received our change, which is definitely not good.  Very disappointed, will not be back."}
{"text":"Based on above average YELP reviews, I tried this Mexican restaurant this week.  I don't agree with the hype.  This place is mediocre at best.  Service was adequate, and food was delivered quickly to the table.   The usual chips were brought to the table with 3 salsas.  I did find the hot salsa particularly good.

My order was the chicken/steak combo fajitas.  There was a generous serving brought to the table, literally smoking hot.  There were lots of onions in the mixture but only a couple thin strips of green bell pepper and a couple small pieces of tomato.  The amount of meat was adequate.  Here's what I didn't like.  The food was overpowered by fajita seasoning.  Three thin small tortillas were rolled in foil.  After unrolling them, they remained curled.  Three fresh tortillas provided in a flat covered server would have been much better.  There were almost no accompaniments to this fajita platter - only a little shredded lettuce and a small dollop of sour cream.   Guacamole was not provided.  I order fajitas a lot, but this setup was below average.

Since another Yelper mentioned the good deal on the $1.99 Margaritas, I tried one.  Don't waste your money.  You really do get what you pay for!  If there was liquor in this Margarita, it wasn't much.  It tasted like diluted Margarita mixer."}
{"text":"Really good good, great service, great salsas. Definitely recommend it! Really nice selection on the menu and great prices. Give them a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"When i tell you i love this place i mean it!!! I come from charlotte just so i know im going to get the taste i want and the service i appreciate. I cant wait to actually go during drink specials when im not pregnant."}
{"text":"Great service, very good food and kid friendly. We loved the bean and cheese dip and I love that they brought 4 different salsas right as we were seated."}
{"text":"Great tasting authentic Mexican food ! The service is so great from ordering to checking out, there's always an older gentleman at checkout who makes us laugh with his jokes. The fajitas are seasoned to perfection and their bean quest dip is to die for."}
{"text":"La Unica is just the only place to have decent Mexican and great prices. Although i have moved from Charlotte recently, I have heard that its called Andale now. The thing is that in Charlotte there all lot of Mexicans, but not alot of them can cook. I searched and searched, listened to peoples recommendations and no dice! This place was good. Now I say that having tasted phenomenal Mexican in Chicago, from hole in the wall spots, to lavish date night type places, and in Charlotte I'm sorry to say that there aren't many choices. It's average compared to the places in Chicago, great for the city of Charlotte."}
{"text":"Ok this will about sum it up, we talked to the owner after we had been there numerous times and he told us this. \"When you go to a Mexican restaurants and see a bunch if Latinos , then it's a good place, take a look around! All Latinos here in the restaurant\" good point. The food is authentic and very good reasonable price and a lot of good food to fill you up. I would recommend this to friends"}
{"text":"This is a very inexpensive, unpretentious restaurant. When I went last Saturday around 2:30, the service was good and the food was delivered quickly. The atmosphere is humble (to put it nicely), but to be honest with you, I don't go to a restaurant because I love their décor, I go for the food.

And the food was great.

What I especially enjoyed were the \"authentic\" tacos. Basically, it's corn tortillas with seasoned beef, diced onion, and cilantro on top. It's a very simple, basic dish. And they nailed it. It's a little out of the way for me, but I'll be going back. I want to try some of their other dishes to see if I enjoy them as much.

And I'm craving those tacos again!!"}
{"text":"The ONLY Mexican restaurant that I will ever eat at. I live their portions, I love the presentation and their homemade salsas are to die for. Not to mention they give your freshly fried tortilla chips! Their desserts are delicious too!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town!! The green salsa is delicious!!! Authentic tacos are worth the trip...."}
{"text":"The service was pretty spotty and the food was not my favorite. They do give you three kinds of salsa but the traditional salsa had a weird flavor.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Simply put, if you are a Taco Bell lover, you probably won't like Andele.  It is a very authentic Mexican restaurant.  The food is fresh and very good.  The prices are cheap.  And, the place is clean and neat.

For a Mexican restaurant, the place is very clean and inviting.  It is definitely not over the top.  the next time you are in the Concord area and want some authentic Mexican food at a good price, try out Andele.  You won't be disappointed.

Or go to Taco Bell if that is your thing.  It's not mine."}
{"text":"Andele!,.....One of the best Mexican restaurants in Concord.  Upon being seated you are offered 3 different types of salsas....one that is for gringos, one that is Mild like most other restaurants and then the green salsa (aka Molten Lava)...
   I've had many different dishes from here and have yet to be disappointed.  Their shrimp tacos are very tasty, small but tasty.  My only gripe is that the Arroz con Pollo doesn't reheat well,...too much cheese that gets all congealed. A way that I can judge a good Mexican dive is by way of their patrons.  If the majority of the diners are of the ethnicity of the restaurant's background then it must be good and so is the way of Andele."}
{"text":"Good overall. Salsa selection is good. Good menu selection. A number of other local Mexican restaurants we have been to get smoky. This is generally clear. Service has been good."}
{"text":"My first visit after so many recomendations. Atmosphere common to many Mexican restaurants. Unique are the 3 different complimentary salsas serverd with chips. Different heat levels and all are great! We had the tacos darados Mexicanas and enchiladas verdes. Both were very good altough the enchiladas could have been heated a bit more. The Texas margaritas were very good! We will visit again!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! I had lunch here with a co-worker and they are speedy, friendly, and have great lunch prices. The food was really good and you get a lot for your money. They also bring out three types of salsa in the beginning - all were delicious! I now plan my route some days around being in the area around lunch time so I can have this for lunch!"}
{"text":"So yummy!

I have been going here for 10+ years now and it's the best Mexican food since I moved here from Southern California! Delicious!"}
{"text":"This was amazing. Forreal. Gonna be feeling it later. I had a burrito that was as big as my plate. It was so good. Three salsas. If you leave there hungry that's your own fault. The cheesecake dessert was so yummy. I'm ready to go back."}
{"text":"Best in concord for years- loving the larger restaurant! I always eat the cheese steak or andele burrito with steak- meat was so tender! Yummy! Outside seating is great too!"}
{"text":"Just mediocre at best. The staff was very friendly and the food came fast but it just wasn't as good as what I was hoping for considering the rating."}
{"text":"This is a regular spot for us. I enjoy the chimichangas deluxe. Both chicken and beef. They are really good. The margaritas are pretty typical and as always a bit over priced for what you get. 

I had a personal experience here as well after my fiancée dropped a key chain I had made for her. We figured it had to have been lost here and after a few days I called and let them know I was looking for it. I called back the next day and the manager said he thought he saw it. I felt like I wasn't going to get it back. I called one more time and the manager said he found it. I was happy to have it back as I bought it for her and its value was well over $50. Good to see honesty now a days."}
{"text":"Pretty good! I.have been here a few times and almost always get exactly what I asked for. The food is just your typical Mexican but cheap and good amount for price."}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food. One of the best Mexican restaurants in Concord. 
It starts with the chips and 3 kinds of dip they bring you and then it only gets better. 
Huge menu.. May take you a while to decide what to order."}
{"text":"Most authentic Mexican restaurant we have found in NC. We are from California & have been searching for a good Mexican restaurant, found one in Morganton but the drive from Charlotte is a bit far. This place is legit, menudo, lingua, horchata & spicy salsa! Eat here, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets Authentic Mexican!! I have eaten at MANY Mexican restaurants throughout Concord, Kannapolis, and Charlotte...this is by far...THE BEST and Authentic! Huge Menu, Lots of Options and the best is HOMEMADE tortillas...Outstanding service and food. They give you 3 different types of salsa's and they are all amazing! They are expanding and adding a full bar too. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Ate here for a quick lunch with co-workers. The place was empty which is surprising because the food is outstanding. Although it was around 3pm on a Wednesday, that could explain it!

We started with the 3 different salsas and chips. The salsas were great, spicy and I enjoyed them. There was a red mild, red spicy and a green chili one.

I ordered the carne asada tacos which came out on a piping hot plate with green peppers and onions. It also came with 4 corn tortillas and pico de gallo. Delicious! It reminded me very much of the tacos we had in Cabo, very straight forward with meat, pico de gallo and the tortillas. It also came with a side of rice and refried beans, very good as well. I was so full because it was a ton of food. I have found it difficult to find a decent Mexican restaurant in the south and I really wish this place was closer to home! If ever we are in Charlotte/Concord again we'll have to go here again!

The service was wonderful too, the owner's daughter was our waitress and her sweet son was there helping her, he is the \"manager\" in training and at just 8-years old he really knew what he was doing. It was so cute and made for a great experience!  There is plenty of seating and the drink menu looked delicious."}
{"text":"As a Mexican I look for the real deal, and this place is has it all! Very authentic Mexican plates and amazing salsas. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Worst experience with a Mexican restaurant in this area.  Hugely overpriced.  Only one free refill on chips, and chips are charged if you don't spend enough.  Came in Friday night and took over an hour after ordering to get food.  Way too big of a restaurant with far too small of a kitchen to service the tables.  Only queso offered for our inconvenience.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Love their grilled shrimp.  Suggested they add a side if shrimp to the menu as an add-on to other entrees.

Husband is more the mexican food guy. Its his number one place.  My number two."}
{"text":"Wow! We rely on Yelp when we travel, tonight at Andele was our biggest ever disconnect between Yelp reviews and our personal experience.  

The Service was quick (the food came out fast) but inattentive (the waitress didn't check back with us and let my glass get completely empty including the ice I ate to get through the meal).  My wife had the Beef Taco salad. She enjoyed what was there but commented on the meager serving of meat on the dish. I had the Burrito Verde.  It came out warm but not hot.  After a few bites I decided that what I was eating was worse than what I would get if I asked for it to be microwaved.  I sent it back to be warmed  up and got just what I expected - I had to wait for it to cool.  The beef in the Burrito was hard to find warmed up, it was a sad meal.  Ending on an up not the guacamole was good and the 3 salsas were a nice touch.

I'm hoping that we caught them on an off night but we pass through so infrequently they won't be getting a second chance to show me.  We will eat somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken soup it was ok. The chips were cold and my sprite tastes weird. Good service though."}
{"text":"Giving a rating of 5 stars after our first visit...
Server Javier is excellent; so kind and friendly. For starters they provide (complimentary) tortilla chips with THREE different salsas. We ordered 2 entrees; the Chile Rellenos and Camarones de Chipotle- both excellent. The other local Mexican restaurants don't compare in our opinion.  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Blah. Not great. I've had worse but also had much better. I had a burrito which was ok and a chicken quesadilla that was horrible. (Didn't think you could mess up a quesadilla!) My husband enjoyed his meal!"}
{"text":"I am going to say 21/2 stars...
Ok this place was known as La Unica  and I have checked in under that name because, it seems that no one has reviewed this place.

      I swear by the La Unica in Huntersville but, it maybe why they changed the name. Service TERRIBLE. Here is the story your a Mexican Joint Ok Most Mexican joints are known for their chips and Salsa Ok they had 3 different types ( of Salsa) but, I would be making tortilla chips to order I mean come on 2 cuts in The corn shells drop in hot oil and Wham fresh chips a little salt . 
      They may not have been out of a bag but, they certainly were not fresh. Strike ONE. I ordered the ceviche  for a starter ... Starter key word here I had to ask for it 3 times . Not sure where they got the recipe they need to start over Strike TWO . Do not ask me why I ordered fried fish at a Mexican restaurant but, I was surprised it was pretty tasty.
        The wife had shrimp with Chipotle sauce it was more like Shrimp Alfredo with two Huge pieces of Chipotle in the sauce it did have a pretty good taste even though there was nothing Italian about it. We had Desert to go Flan ( I had to go   traditional) not bad . We also had a slice of the tres leches cake it was pretty tasty as well.... maybe they need to go into the desert business? Would I go back? Ummm not really worth the drive I did see a Sushi place next door?"}
{"text":"First time here it was a late lunch .. Their chips and salsa's are awesome they bring you 4 for your liking .. Btw I liked them all .. The red hot one I liked best .. I like it hot !!! I ordered the El trio excellent .. It's a must try .. I will come back and will take pictures of the food .. Very clean and the service was great that why I give it 5"}
{"text":"Was not impressed with anything at this restaurant. Menu was repetitive, food was fair at best. Margaritas were strange. Odd color and taste. No hint of \"margarita\" at all. Perhaps having an actual drink menu would help. Doubt that I will return."}
{"text":"Great ownership, very hospitable and the food is delicious! I order to go a lot and the wait time isn't long.. now you can order through #yelp"}
{"text":"This place had great service, excellent food and huge portions at a reasonable price. Will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have ever had from a Mexican restaurant it's authentic Mexican food! The service is amazing, not to mention all the wait staff are very polite and patient. The owner is very family oriented and cares a lot about his customers and staff. If you want some amazing Mexican food and great service definitely try Andele!!!!"}
{"text":"Andele is my favorite spot for a quick meal at a reasonable price. The service always ranges between good and excellent. The three (yes, three!) complimentary salsas are all great, but a little on the spicy side (they're manageable if you're willing to spend a few bucks on some queso to mix in). Pro tip: either order something with carnitas in it, or substitute whatever meat comes with your dish for it. Soooo good! I'm pretty sure they serve Andele's carnitas in heaven. If they don't, then I never want to die, so I can have it on earth forever."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  This is very authentic food.  They have a great selection on the menu.  The food always is hot and tastes really good.  Their food is spiced very well and is a welcome relief from the typical \"same old mexican song and dance\" restaurants out there.  They give you 4 different dipping sauces to go with your chips.  They have everything from super hot to mild so something for everyone.  I love their margaritas but that is the only alcoholic beverage I have had there.  For the most part I have always received good service here.  Love their pico de gallo and their avocado garnish is always so ripe and delish."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Andele, because the rating was good - and were promptly (ahem) disappointed.

Though they do offer a variety of sauces, the rest of the meal is not impressive in any way. Perhaps there are not a lot of Mexican choices in the area (and I don't think there are), but surely there has to be something better than this. Though the salsa selection is decent, the chips that it is served with were not impressive in any way.

Even the decorations on the walls were not particular interesting."}
{"text":"Probably the most bland food, poor and slowest service ever received at a Mexican Restaurant in my life. Definitely will not be back. Fiesta Mexicana is less than a block behind this strip mall and exponentially better and more authentic."}
{"text":"well I've been a few times and the food foes not Disappoint. I've also gone with a crowed for Karaoke, always good service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Excellent mole' and Tres Leches. Our 7 year old loved the beef enchiladas. Three types of salsa. Friendly service. Try the bakery in the same shopping center for authentic Mexican bread and pastries. Happy to have found this place."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food.  First time in for a work meeting and I was not disappointed.  I had the Crazy Burrito, because sane burritos just was not on the menu.  Having the rice on top with the cheese sauce was tremendous.  I usually dont't eat the rice, but this way made it easy to do.  

For those light in the pants stay away from the sauce in the red ketchup bottle.  The other three salsas are really good though. 

Next time I am in town this will be on the short list of places to eat."}
{"text":"Still the best!  Excellent food and service!  Pastor, Barbacoa, and fish tacos are great."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best when you are craving authentic Mexican food. Awesome variety of salsa (mix it with the Queso cheese). I have eaten here a lot so I can't honestly say I have a favorite meal but I do love the tacos (beef, pork, chicken & fish), fajitas and tamales. They have a warm friendly staff that caters to the customers. 

If you love Mexican food, Andele is the place go."}
{"text":"Worth every star - food was excellent, tasty and hot. Spicy dip almost made me cry, perfect! Reasonable prices, friendly service"}
{"text":"I went because the I heard it was good mexican good for Charlotte. Having been to some of Chicago's best Mex spots... I have to admit the 'bar was high'. I didn't like the food here. I had 2 steak tacos and the meat tasted dry, I felt like they made it earlier in the day and just microwaved it for me and I had 1 fish taco. I didn't like it at all, it tasted really 'fishy' and the tortillas weren't that good.

I talked to some locals and they said that the new management messed up the quality of the food."}
{"text":"True Mexican not the Spanglish fare most gravitate toward. Only downside is the tortillas are not homemade.  Love the variety of tacos. Can you say tripe?  And the ceviche is a lime party on your tongue. Face it. When half the patrons are Latino, you know it's authentic!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!  Service was great too. We love the roasted pepper salsa!"}
{"text":"First a disclaimer:  this is the first time I've eaten here, but I was very impressed.  The place gives a good first impression.  Clean and decent looking, some decorations on the wall.  Very comfortable.

Everyone else is right about the salsa, it was very good.  We liked the regular red salsa, it was very mild and sweet, but the table full of construction workers two tables from us demolished two bottles of the  spicy green salsa, so everyone gets something they like.  

The prices are reasonable and the portion sizes are decent.  We ordered the beef & chicken fajitas and a triple combination of soft taco, burrito and chicken quesadilla.  All four were delicious.  The fajitas were better than Chili's.  The burrito was very good, similar to some Tex Mex burritos that I've had, but seasoned better.  The taco was on the small side, but still good.  The chicken quesadilla was very good, surprisingly so.  I liked the burrito best, but my fiancée thought the enchilada and the fajitas were awesome.  We were impressed with all the entrees.  

Things I did not like: the rice was dry and just okay.  The sour cream was offered as a side and not a condiment.  Seems a little cheap.  It was still good sour cream, and went well with the quesadilla.  We did get some stale chips in one basket, but the next basket we received were very fresh.  It's happened to me in other restaurants and not a big deal.  Tacos were small, I don't know that a order of three would be enough.

Restrooms were clean and had warm water.

All in all, a fantastic cheap Mexican restaurant.  We were completely stuffed and paid just under $30 including tip and iced teas.  The small complaints do not detract at all from the experience and I have no problem recommending it to any fan of affordable Mexican food."}
{"text":"Went there because I always see cars parked outside and wanted to have some good Mexican food.  I was not disappointed.  The salsas (there were 4 of varying heat) were delicious.  It was a Saturday so they had posole.  I was not disappointed.  Just wish they had more condiments to add to it. Radishes and avocado would have topped this off.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to really like this place, but we both agree it's going downhill. He's a meat eater, and he says the meat dishes aren't as flavorful as they used to be. I'm a vegetarian, and lately the vegetarian dishes I've ordered have been really greasy. There have been a few occasions recently when we had slow service. At least twice I have nearly slipped and fallen here because the floor was slick with grease or oil, like they tried to mop it up but only succeeded in smearing it around. Ah well, at least Fiesta is right next door."}
{"text":"Lots of food fair price great service."}
{"text":"Great food. Try the spicy avocado salsa"}
{"text":"Burrito plate ok. Quesadillas were great.  Fish tacos ok. Combo plates great. $1.99 margaritas were very good. We will be back."}
