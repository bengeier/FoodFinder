{"text":"Tamales!  And good ones to boot.  They have a crazy $0.99 special on their margaritas during happy hours which oddly goes from 11am to 4:00pm.  Compared to other mexican food offerings in the CLE area you'd be hard pressed to find any real faults to the food, and service. Very fast, and extremely friendly.  Oh, and by the way....try the tamales!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Service is quick and friendly. Portions are enormous and delish! I have been to Mi Pollo for lunch and dinner several times and never disappointed. The steak & chicken fajitas are my favorite. The carne asad tacos are fantastic. Salsa is great and the chips are always fresh! If your looking food good Mexican, this is it!"}
{"text":"This place proves that you really do find the best food in the humblest places.  Housed in a former donut shop, Mi Pollo pushes out humble and delicious Tex Mex.    The people at this restaurant have to be the friendliest of any restaurant we've ever visited.  The food is delicious, especially if you venture off from the standard Tex Mex fare and try one of their specialties such as Chipotle Cream Chicken or Stuffed Poblanos.   True to their name, though, the specialty is fire grilled chicken.    Prices are fantastic.  They offer 1 cent margaritas at lunch and usually have a 2 for 1 special on margaritas in the evening.  Our entire family of four can get out for about $25 and still have leftovers for the next day.  You'll be treated like family and will leave feeling like you ate a wonderful meal at someone's home.  EDITED:  Sadly, this place is no longer open"}
{"text":"After driving by the restaurant many times and thinking \"We should stop in and give it a try\", we did finally manage to have lunch there today 06/07/11. My husband had the \"speedy gonzales\", a taco, enchilada, beans & rice, and I had the Taco Salad both were very, very good. I am really glad we stopped."}
