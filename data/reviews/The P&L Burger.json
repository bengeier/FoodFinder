{"text":"Reviewed Dish: (Basic) Hamburger  Reviewed during: Mon - Fri Lunch time Service Speed: 5 / 5 Cooking speed: 4 / 5 Food Quality: 5 / 5 Food Quantity: 5 / 5 Price: 4 / 5  Cleanness: 5 / 5  Repeat: Yes  In order to compare the burgers on Queen West, I ordered 1 burger from Burger Priest and 1 burger from P&L burger and eat it at the same time. In conclusion, I think Burger Priest taste just a little bit better, but you will be more fulfilled eating at P&L, and the wait time is significantly shorter at P&L.  Go for the $3 combo option. Fries alone cost $3 already."}
{"text":"I was craving a nice burger for a while and when I googled best burgers in toronto, P&L was suggested so I thought I would give it a try.   We decided to get take out which consisted of the fried chicken burger and the castor burger. When I got home, I was utterly disappointed. The chicken was like biting into some sort of crunchy foam - It was not of chicken texture at all. For the castor burger, I requested to take off the peameal bacon, but it was still on my burger. I know I can just take it off, which I did, but it was a clear indication of bad service.   In a nutshell, this is not a place I would go again. Bad service, horrible food, not worth the money or efforts."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short.  Great burger--I just went for the plain jane (twice now). For some reason they get the bun just right. Can I say that?   I actually like the P&L burger better than a Burger's Priest burger which tend to come a little scrunched up in the bag. A friend threatened to unfriend me for that. Lol.  But the fries are, like everyone else's, just OK--which is to say, a little soggier than one expects a french fry to be. We want frites people: french fries that crunch!"}
{"text":"So disappointed went to try the P&L burger that one on burger wars , it was awful made me feel ill cause it was so greasy , and I ended up having to eat it with a fork because the whole thing fell apart with my first bite"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for the second time in a few months, on a hungry whim, and inquired about the gluten-free option. They wrap the burger in kale! Curious, I order the original P&L à la kale. It was fantastic! Without any bread to buffer the flavors and sauces, it was soo tasty. Service was quick too! My go-to burger joint."}
{"text":"Got P&L from uber eats.  Took over an hour.  Ooold ass, cold fries and rings.  Burgs were good but cold as well. I'm not expecting steaming hot food with delivery, but the sides were really bad and obviously old cause they were too lazy to make fresh stuff."}
{"text":"Burgers top my list of perfect meals - without question. With Burger Priest a stone's throw away from this new location, I had to drag myself away from my usual stomping grounds to try what I've been told was one of the best burgers in the city.   I have to reluctantly admit that it is a FANTASTIC burger - it actually exceeded my expectation. I wasn't ready to let another burger joint into my heart just yet.   There are some key highlights that set this burger apart from its other amazing neighborhood counterparts:   - The bun - thicker more resilient (fresh with \"good grip\")   - The lettuce - nothing like a sturdy iceberg on a hot burger! No wilting here! Overall the toppings were a bit more elaborate (and fresh)  - The beef - thicker, medium rare style and very juicy, with a nice smokiness. The burger \"falls apart\" in your mouth  - They take credit card... and the price for two burgers, an order of fries and a drink was under $20 (noticeably reasonable)  We tried and split both the P&L and the Deluxe and both were fantastic. The fries were crispy and creamy.  Service was just okay - nothing memorable.   The place was busy, and we opted for a place at the stool bar. Some random mix of 90s hip-hop was blaring, but only added to the fun.   Welcome to the neighborhood, you are truly loved P&L."}
{"text":"A collaboration from the makers of Parts and Labour comes Queen West area's newest destination for burgers. In contention for this new burger joint, is the eponymous P&L Burger which has already clinched a championship title of CMT's Burger Wars.  Sampling many of the burgers, I can see what all the hype is about. The P&L (sauteed mushrooms, bacon onion jam, pickle dill mayo) is worth every bit of that Burger Wars championship title.   And then theres \"The Italian\" (Mozzarella, Roasted hot & sweet peppers, Sauteed onions, Marinara sauce) which was equally memorable as a burger. It's like chicken parm, except with a patty and on a burger. The fact that they didn't hold back on the spice is a plus for me.  Aside form burgers they have an AWESOME Poutine (with real cheese curds!), a healthy Kale Caesar Salad, and milkshakes.   If you can get past the utilitarian decor, the P&L Burger in my opinion is a definite winner."}
{"text":"I opted for the P&L burger when coming here and it was quite tasty. The meat was juicy, the cheese was melty, and the toppings were plentiful. That being said, it was far too messy. I could only get through eating half of it before it fell apart completely. I ordered onion rings with my meal as well and i did not even touch them, the burger is very filling. I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I had the regular burger and added cheese ... it was a lot of burger! A lot of toppings and a good size of meat so I was excited to try it, but was disappointed.    The meat was dry and needed salt, the thick tomatoes took over the burger I had to take them out. The only good thing about my meal was the gravy. Even the fries were limp.   I'll probably go back to try a different burger and their poutine."}
{"text":"P&L gets my vote for best cheap burger in Toronto."}
{"text":"Parts & Labour's win on CMT's Burger Wars have spurred them to open up The P&L Burger in the space where White Squirrel Snack Shop once - briefly - lived. Similar to the previous tenant, stools line the front area and another set lines the block past the cash where eager eaters await their quickly served burgers.  While their show-winning The P&L Burger is available at the restaurant proper, you'll get it at their burger shop for much less. Current favourites are The Italian - a spicy mess of oozing cheese, marinara, and hot peppers (gonna add more hot peppers next time) and The Castor that sports a slice of peameal and smeared with sweet BBQ sauce. Those looking for a simpler deal should look to The Hamburger. Vegetarians can opt for The Big Tempeh.  From my order today, the bun to meat ratio is good and the flavour of the patty is also beefy enough to come through even the heavier topping combinations. The bun is fluffy enough (though I'd like a bit more chew on it - minor quibble), but holds together quite well. The size of the burger itself is quite large, though most should be able to finish this. Maybe with a nap later on.  There are onion rings, fries, dill pickles, poutine, hot peppers, and a caesar kale salad. I chuckled at the salad. Fountain pop gets free refilles and you can snag a milkshake or soft serve as a sweet treat.  My burger pick for the area.  More photos: Excessive burger porn on the blog."}
{"text":"Winner of Burger Wars...make reservations ahead of time if you want to avoid rubbing elbows with strangers...tables are sized for large groups, perfect for those hosting 10+... need to visit again for BBQ season and chef's window.... Pretty fancy for burgers and drinks.... missing entertainment imo."}
{"text":"Love their burgers. So juicy. Not sure why it was so quiet here on a Saturday afternoon. I like their buns more than the ones at Burgers Priest down the street, but both places serve super juicy sinfully delicious patties."}
{"text":"Better toppings and a bigger patty than burgers priest. Would recommend as a very solid burger shop."}
{"text":"The veggie burger and kale caeser were very tasty for the vegetarian diner. The salad was flavourful and textures.  The burger fixings and bun were outstanding, including beautiful cheese, but the tempeh is very much a slab of grilled tempeh.   My omnivorous dining companion loved his burger.  Thick pillowy bun, great toppings (P&L burger) and the meat was perfectly cooked with just enough crispy grill bits."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through a courier app.  When the order arrived none of the sides were included, despite being on the bill. We called to tell them this and were told:  1) she has to speak to the manager to see if they can give us a credit or refund for the items we didn't get. Apparently this isn't considered a given?  2) if the manager approves, we can go to the restaurant and pick up our refund/credit.  So for tonight, I guess we just get to eat half a meal, but the good news is we might not have to pay for food we never got, as long as the manager approves.   With customer service like that, I doubt we'll bother with P & L again."}
{"text":"Delicious burger. I had the deluxe and it's right up there with my favourite from Holy Chuck. Didn't like the fries that much thus only a 4 out of 5."}
{"text":"4/5! p&l burger with kale substitute instead of a bun is the way to go!!! This place does not have a lot of seating so be prepared to take your burgers to go if you arrive during a crowded time. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Awesome!! I've been twice and both burgers were amazing. I'll even go as far as saying better than Burger Priest."}
{"text":"All the burger are marked at 10$. They also have the option of wrapping it in kale not bun.    Usually comes in medium rare but most of the time i have visited, it is cooked to medium.....    Next time i will make sure to tell the cooks medium RARE.   I got the classic p&l wrapped in kale.  When cooked to medium rare, it was very juice. so not very friendly to white shirts and get plenty of napkins.  Took about 10 mins to cook."}
{"text":"Ordered the Italian burger and found it to be absolutely delicious with their roasted peppers creating the cherry on top so to speak. Perfectly moist perfectly cooked. Highly recommend. Fries and onion rings were good as well. Just be aware that there isn't a lot of seating but I think everyone already knows that."}
{"text":"Meh. Everything is really salty. There was gravy skin all over the poutine. Not a repeat."}
{"text":"The best burger in the Burger Corner (Queen and Spadina). I had the Deluxe- 10/10. I agree that the lack of seating is a problem, but otherwise, this place is the best."}
{"text":"This was my favourite spot for burgers but sadly the last few times i've been there has been extremely disappointing. Not sure what's going on but there is a significant difference in quality. We normally order The Deluxe and PnL Burger and both times the bread was hard and chewy, and the burgers were super dry and not well seasoned. I'm not giving up on this place yet -hopefully my next visit will be better!  I should mention that the staff are always super nice. Never any issues with that."}
{"text":"Woefully underwhelming.  I really, really wanted to like this place. I've always enjoyed watching Matty Matheson on Keep it Canada and was really excited to check out his signature burger joint.   But, as I discovered, it's massively overrated. I ordered the P&L burger and fries. The burger was pretty tasteless and slowly disintegrated into a soggy mess as I ate. The fries were salty and stale. There's so many burger places in the area that there's really no reason to settle for a mediocre burger and fries - especially at nearly $15 (including tax) for a basic combo!"}
{"text":"live in the Queen & Soho area, and use all the great takeout places in the vicinity constantly. Burgers aren't at the top of my list, but I have gone to P&L much more frequently than Burger's Priest, although \"The Priest\" is the best.   Today I tried the P & L Fried Chicken sandwich. It was the WORST sandwich I ever had.  It was snowing today and I think someone told the cook to salt the sidewalk, and he put the rock salt on my chicken. It was nauseatingly over salted, I trying scraping the coating off, but the second bite was the same.  I salt almost all my food as I find, most cooks/chefs under salt.  Well, message received loud and clear, unlike Arnold, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Toppings over flavour and mediocre service. Go to burger's priest instead. They recognize the art of simplicity."}
{"text":"I went with the deluxe and it was easily one of the best burgers I have ever eaten.  After just one visit I am prepared to say P&L is one of the top two burger spots in the city.   The fries were awesome, too, and I took no issue with the price.  You have a repeat customer here."}
{"text":"Amazing burger. Terrible service. The burger was big and tasty, exactly what I was going for, really hit the spot. The service was me putting a tip on the debit machine and then being handed a slip and told nothing about how when my burger was ready the kitchen would shout out my number from way in the back for me to come and collect it.  I heard my number called a couple of times and thought they must be telling the server. Then she went back there and started yelling my number and saying \"your burger is ready!\" I got up to go get it and she handed it to me and said \"in the back its always in the back\" like I was an idiot who didn't understand how life works.  Why do people like this work in the service industry? And why the heck on the debit machine is there a request to tip on a $13 burger (just burger, no fries and drink) when she can't even be bothered to bring me my burger or even tell me I'm supposed to get it myself when I place my order? So I'm just giving her two bucks to get yelled at?   I'd go back for the burger. It was that good. But she's never getting a tip from me again."}
{"text":"love the burgers, the kale ceasar salad is amazing. haaaaated the playlist though. seems petty but i cant listen so pig squeals at 3:00 in the afternoon"}
{"text":"Ordered the Philly burger through Foodo (which is a genius app for people with a definitive lunch \"hour\") and had to hike it back to my office for a good 10 minutes. Not only was it still nicely warm but it was fantastic! Seasoned beef, cooked perfectly, sautéed mushrooms and onions and added hot peppers = joy. You know when you have a taste for something and nothing else will do but that? I was craving a burger and I got a stellar  example of one. The pig in me immediately wished I had ordered 2...but that would have been gluttonous and ridiculous. Crossed my mind though. Just sayin'."}
{"text":"I had the Castor burger, and it was excellent. The burger was moist, flavourful and the toppings were delicious - there wasn't too much (or not enough) of any topping to overwhelm the flavour of the burger. I see the fries are receiving mixed reviews - I personally like the chunky cut, and found them to be slightly on the well-done side (which is how I prefer them). The setup of the restaurant, however, isn't great - there is very little seating and you have to go to the back of the restaurant to pick up your burger. For some reason, they have placed a massive bar that takes up a good part of the restaurant in the centre - maybe they do shakes or something? There are no tables - just a bar against the wall to sit and eat. I wish the layout was better, but the food is worth going back."}
{"text":"Really pleased with this place! I will return again and again (alternating with my other fave burger joint of course).  I had the Castor Burger and it was SO GOOD!  This burger is filling! The service here was really great as well - lovely staff.  It's only 3 dollars extra to turn your burger into a combo which I felt isn't too bad. At the end you're paying  what you would for a sit down restaurant meal in a take out type place, but the quality of the food is quite good! Worth it!"}
{"text":"Yeah burgers priest is good, but P&L is way better. like waaaaaaay better.  I just wish their burgers weren't so messy. They do use a lot of salt but whatever just get some water. If you're in the mood for a tasty burger hop over to p&l, order the pnl, change your life"}
{"text":"Had the Deluxe Burger with onion rings on the side. Burger was cooked perfectly, not greasy at all and very flavourful. Onion rings were AMAZING. Not greasy and the perfect combination of crunch and lightness. Way better than Burgers Priest and I didn't feel guilty after eating it. My new go to burger joint."}
{"text":"Burger was too salty.  Salad was overdressed.  Unlikely to be back."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend after reading the article on Blogto. The menu isn't fancy, but that's not necessarely a bad thing. In fact, I got the Caster and it was delicious. This place uses tasty ingredients. My girlfriend got the Veggie burger and it tasted fully, with excellent ingredient dosage. Service is very kind.  Tip for the owners: The current \"we call the order number when it's ready\" creates confusion, and you can't hear much if the music is loud (I loved the music!)."}
{"text":"This place has good burgers! the fries are just okay. The space and staff are inviting, but there isn't really much seating at the place, it's best to take the food to go.    I had the P&L Burger and recommend it. The fries are alright, but nothing special. the meat in the burger was cooked well, and the toppings were very good.   P&L vs. Burger's Priest:  This place is a few of doors down from Burger's Priest. When comparing the two, Burger's Priest still trumps P&L Burger. Burger's Priest fries are better and the meat is juicier.   P&L, however, are more adventurous with their toppings and the toppings on my burger were excellent and complemented the beef patty."}
{"text":"So I finally went to the P&L for a burger. Burgers are never my 1st choice when it comes to eating. Working against the situation was also the fact that when I had a burger last year at The Burger Priest, it was terrible. So I put on a brave face and walked in and ordered a chef burger, also know as The Franco. Omg it was amazing. Just the right amount of beef, mushrooms, double Brie cheese and bun. I will be back for another that's for sure. I had onion rings and they were ok, fries were ok too but the main meal is the unforgettable burger!!!! And that was downright delish. Another plus is the customer service. The guys working the place are polite, professional and friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, as it was super close to my work and convenient. The P&L burger is really tasty and the meat is super fresh.   However, the fries here are really bland and hard to eat unless you have tons of ketchup. I would suggest getting the kale Caesar salad instead, but this is a pretty pricey lunch and comes to over 15 dollars! I also find the service to be slow and not the friendliest."}
{"text":"Bummer!  I came here because it was on BlogTO's newest list of best non-veg restaurants for vegans and vegetarians. I'm definitely in the mood for a burger and fries from time to time, and thought that if it was on the list, it must be a good contender. Man, oh, man. It does not belong on that list.  I ordered their vegetarian burger option, told the guy I wanted it prepared vegan, and he let me know that the bun was egg-washed and the special \"P&L Sauce\" was mayo-based. So I got it without. What I got, then, for $9 was: - A small-ish brick of tempeh, with no seasoning to speak of - wrapped in a limp and pale piece of kale - topped with tomato, pickle, lettuce & onion. I had to top it with my own ketchup and mustard. This thing was lame. It was bland and unfilling. It was a bad stereotype of shitty vegan food. I was ashamed to take it back to my office and eat it in front of people. I can fully support a tempeh-based burger alternative, but it needs some character, man. This was terrible.  It's a brand-new establishment, so it's really inexplicable why it's on that BlogTO list. I can't imagine an actual vegan compiled that thing.  I will not go back."}
{"text":"Went with a friend and we both loved it. He ordered the daily special they had (during their anniversary week), which was the Italian with a side of Kale Cesar salad and I ordered The Castor with a side of onion rings. I didn't get to try the Italian but the  Castor... OMG. It was one of the best burgers I've ever had. When I first got it I thought, \"What, no lettuce, no tomatoe?\" Thank God. Whatever they put in that burger worked so well that I've been itching to go back for more ever since. The side of onion rings comes with about  5 or 6 pieces but they're huge, so they make up for quantity in quality. The Kale Cesar salad was very good as well. You could slightly taste the bitterness of the kale but there was also a hint of lemon and the touch of croutons that made it perfect. Next time I think I'll skip the onions rings and go straight for the salad.   The cashier at the front was very friendly as well. She didn't hurry us and let us take our time deciding what to have (I was a beginner so I needed some help figuring it out).   The only downside is the seating. There are no tables available for group sit-downs so if you plan to go with a group of friends, you'll all have to sit in a line facing the mirrored walls. The seating is also minimal but hey, these burgers are worth a walk-n-eat sort of thing.  Definitely will be coming back. Beats any burger joint on Queen St W."}
{"text":"Last week was burger #5, The Italian!  I know my previous review I said I'll substitute the bun for kale leaves, but I just couldn't do it.  A burger is not a burger without the buns.  I did substitute the fries for the coleslaw and wished I had just stuck to the order of fries.  The coleslaw was served in a styrofoam cup which made me think if it was all pre-made and stored in the fridge and for how long.  I would have been fine if the coleslaw was scooped onto the tray next to the burger to save the styrofoam cup. The coleslaw tasted very watery and very bland  (they normally would charge $3 for this).  I also had a big piece of cabbage in my serving which was missed being shredded, but how can they miss a piece that was 2\" by 2\" in size?  Since I don't like wasting food, I attempted to consume the coleslaw, but almost half way through, I had to give up, I just couldn't eat any more of it.   Anyway, The Italian made up for the awful tasting coleslaw.  Thank goodness this place is known for their burgers.  The Italian burger consisted of  the usual meaty, beefy and flavourful patty, plus served with mozzarella cheese, roasted hot & sweet peppers, sauteed onions and marinara sauce.  Just looking at the burger, I knew it was going to be a messy eat as the cheese and sauce was just oozing out of the burger. Plus picking up the burger itself, my hands felt the oozing of the cheese and sauce which reminded me of the veal sandwich I had the other day.  The first bite was absolutely amazing as I tasted the melted cheesy goodness blended with the tasty marinara sauce, plus the hot and sweet peppers added a nice kick and texture to the burger. And who doesn't enjoy sauteed onions on their burger?  I managed to masticated the burger fairly quickly despite the messiness and enjoyed every morsel of the scrumptious burger. Molto bene e delizioso!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious. Bf and I both had the Italian with a kale wrap and neither of us were disappointed. The beef was juicy but the ends were surprisingly crispy -great flavor and texture overall."}
{"text":"The original P&L in the Junction won best burger on you gotta eat here or some foodie show, and having tried it the original spot and fully agreeing, i tried the newer digs at queen and spadina which is more of a takeout spot with a few bar stools. The burger is still full awesomeness - big, tasty, juicy and maple bacon jam? What more do you need!  If you're craving a satisfying burger, give the Priest a pass a few doors down and try this premium burger."}
{"text":"Place blows. Save your money please and go somewhere else. I'm warning you in advance."}
{"text":"Waited 25 - 30 mins for 2 burgers and 1 order of fries.  No other orders in front of us. Place was dead. Got the P&L Burger and the Deluxe Burger; cold when we got them and the bun was dry, burger overlooked and the toppings didn't help it."}
{"text":"I am a huge burger fan and this (Philly) burger is the absolute best burger I've had. Absolutely outstanding!"}
{"text":"I've talked with a manager through email and he handled the issue professionally. He seemed like a super nice guy as well.   He offered me a meal but I just decided to get a credit from the app. because it seemed more appropriate.   Hope the delivery goes well next time."}
{"text":"Tonight my fiancée and I decided to try out P & L Burger. I got the Kale Cesar and the Deluxe Burger where as my fiancée got the Castor Burger with Onion Rings. Overall, really delicious! The only downside was the bun, it was pretty soggy but other then that everything was quite good! Would definitely go back as we both agreed the charbroiled meat patty was epic!"}
{"text":"Will I be back? Yes. Can I remember what I had when I was there? Nope. I think it was The Castor, which was good. But it definitely wasn't OH EM GEEE this is the best burger ever, I have to tell all my BFF's about it!"}
{"text":"After watching Burger Wars Toronto, we knew we had to try Burgers Priest and P&L Burger (which are on the same street )while visiting Toronto. We never made it to Dangerous Dans. The plan...one go to BP, one to P&L and meet back at the car for a food fest.  I ordered the P&L Burger, fries, and onion rings and high tailed it back to the car to dig in. I didn't really taste much bacon jam, but it was a delicious burger. The onion rings were delicious. The fries I think I have to give to Burgers Priest. The P&L were a little too dark. The burger meat itself I think goes to P&L. It was very juicy and \"meatier\" tasting if that makes sense!!    The restaurant itself isn't very appealing. A few stools to eat at, white walls with writing all over it, and a view of the kitchen. But hey, you are there for a great burger, not ambience!!"}
{"text":"I've been heading to P&L since they opened a few years ago. It was my favourite burger, even compared to The Priest just down the street. Unfortunately, I think this place has gone seriously downhill. I ordered The Deluxe - a pretty classic burger. The place wasn't busy. My Deluxe was one of the worst burgers I've had in awhile: bland and dry. Well, see ya, P&L. I'm heading to The Priest from now on."}
{"text":"This place has a very good burger, that's why I'm a repeat customer. It's not the best in Toronto, but it's damn close!   I ordered the Deluxe (their bacon cheeseburger) with fries, and devoured every last bit of it. The burger is perfectly grilled, and I think they toast their buns as well. Everything was tasty, although quite messy...  It's got a clean, minimalist decor which suits them. Nothing fancy. Just straightforward, good tasting food.  There is another burger joint a few doors down on Queen West that edges them out just a bit on taste, but if you don't have cash, or feel like waiting in a line and then struggling to find a seat - come here... You won't be disappointed. :-)"}
{"text":"P&L makes a darn good burger.   The patties are moist and succulent, unlike some other burger joints i've been to. The portions are generous and the pricing is reasonable for about $8-10 a piece. An additional $3 gets you fries and a drink. Pretty typical \"gourmet burger\" prices.  I ordered the \"The Italian\", which was served with mozzarella, roasted sweet and hot peppers, sautéed onions and marinara sauce. It reminded me more of a veal parmesan sandwich than a traditional burger. However, it was undeniably delicious.  I know Burger Priest is a few door downs and serves as a burger benchmark for many, but I think P&L gives the Priest a run for their money. I'll be back to try their more traditional burgers."}
{"text":"Tasty burgers, but too many condiments makes them fall apart. The  onion wings are good, too. Their signature P&L Burger is good, with a taste of bacon. Friendly service."}
{"text":"I should have known it was a bad idea to eat here when I walked in and it was empty at 6:30 on a Wednesday night. The menu is pretty standard burger fare. I got the deluxe and because I was starving I got fries and onion rings. The fries were burnt and obviously cooked in old oil. The onion rings were drenched in oil too. I'd give the fries a 2/10 and onion rings a 3/10. The burger itself was pretty bland. Considering the deluxe toppings, it had no crunch, no sweetness, no zing. The quality of the toppings was pretty bad too. The beef had some hard parts and chewy gristle.   Overall, I would rate this meal below a chain such as Harvey's and certainly below Wendy's. It was pretty appalling given the price. Atmosphere is blah. Dirty white walls, poor layout and the music was too loud.   There are 5 or 6 amazing burgers within 10 minutes walk. I think this place needs an entire revamp to compete."}
{"text":"Look out BP...there's finally some competition in town.  I honestly would have to think about where to go if I needed a top end burger, which happens quite regularly btw.  BP vs. P&L  Let me start by saying that I still give the edge to BP because of the meat.  The BP burger tastes a bit fresher & juicer and the bun a little softer too but P&L is no slouch either.  The P&L patty has more of a different style, more like it was right off the grill.  I will say that P&L offers many more inventive burger choices.   I also like the fact that P&L burgers are bigger and messier, the way a real burger should be.  I think P&L fountain coke could be a bit bigger.  I wish they gave cans as I needed a refill as I worked through the meal.  The fries seem like they are a draw.    I have to say, P&L presents a very interesting option to burger fans on Queen West.  Like I said, I like BP a little better right now but this place is making me think twice every time."}
{"text":"I waited for my burger for about 20 minutes and asked what was going on. They felt really bad so they gave me a free chocolate milk shake and it was awesome.   I finally got my burger but my friends had finished their meal. So I took it to go and headed back to the office. I can't remember which burger it was, it think it was called the Castro. Regardless, it was delicious.   Whenever I eat a burger I feel a lot of regret but there was something different about this burger. I didn't feel extremely stuffed or full of grease which is probably due to fresh ingredients being used. It was a shared opinion between me and my friends and we were pleasantly surprised.   I'll definitely come back to this place but I feel they are still working out the kinks in getting things in order. A proper line and more seats would be nice. All in all, a great place for a burger. Plus it's a bit cheaper than burger's priest."}
{"text":"When I need to indulge a burger craving, I like to feel satisfied when I leave the restaurant and P&L delivers! This means a nice sized patty of tasty beef slathered with whatever their choice of sauce is and a hearty bun I can grab with both hands. Since this can be a delicate manoeuvre some days, and P&L burgers are no exception, once I had a grip on this delightful burger, I didn't let go until it was gone. Very good. Fries were tasty too. Now I know why the place is busy with happy munchers whenever I walk by. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Walked into Burger Priest and was turned off by the cramped space and lack of seating. Moreover the options didn't sound too appealing to me. At least not tempting enough for me to excuse the atmosphere. Walked down the street and saw this little place. It sounded familiar but it was pretty empty, we popped by around 5PM. The service was great, the cashier was super friendly. My friend and I both ordered the deluxe burger combo($13-ish). I really liked my burger. They didn't skimp on toppings but this just made it incredibly messy to eat. The fries were crispy and I prefer fries to be soft but they weren't bad. Overall really nice experience here, I'd come back."}
{"text":"This place is probably the worst burger place in Toronto.  I decided to try this place with a buddy, got the P&L burger with a side of coleslaw when I got the burger I saw right away that the patty was burnt from top side and the other side looked boiled. The coleslaw looked store bought and was way too watery. I was disappointed when i asked if the slaw was made in house. The burger was messy and greasy not pleasant to eat. On top of that when I was there the back kitchen was having a big fight, all I could hear was screaming and yelling; lots of  F-Bombs were dropped."}
{"text":"First burger from P&L Burger today. If this place was a music gig I'd have my top off, at the front, gyrating, with my eyes closed and fists clenched.....but it isn't, so I'll keep my belly overhang tucked away and just get amongst this \"The Castor\" burger.  Probably the best burger I've ever had to be honest. I'll be here often without a doubt."}
{"text":"The burger was actually fantastic. The staff were a great bunch as well. The only quirk was that my wife ordered the chicken which was ready 10 minutes after my burger. They did offer to refund me but that wasn't necessary as the offer alone speaks volumes. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers in town. Puts burger priest to shame. Coleslaw wasn't the best but it's a burger joint should of never ordered Coleslaw."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place.    The P&L burger based on size and looks should've been an easy four stars.  Unfortunately, it was just too salty for my tastebuds.  If it was less seasoned, I would've become a fan for sure.  However, I've stated in the past that I might be more sensitive to sodium in general.  It's just A-OK for now.    I would give this place another try and I would order a different burger too."}
{"text":"They make delicious burgers here. Definitely one of the better burger joints dT. They have good combo deals and selections for sides. Right along queen so it's quite easy to get to. It's only downfall is that it has very limited seating, so if recommend coming for lunch or early in the afternoon because at night it gets quite busy."}
{"text":"The burger was mediocre. For the same price, you could walk down to Burger's Priest. We ordered the poutine, but had to ask them to microwave it. They were kind enough to give us a new one. Service is friendly, but given the myriad burger options in the neighborhood, you may find better value elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best burger that I've had in Toronto... patty was delicious. It had a great seasoning, and was really juicy. The other ingredients went well together too. The bun was a little too big, but that's only a minor complaint.   The fries were great as well.   Price seemed pretty reasonable... $12 including the drink and fries.   I will definitely be back next time I want a burger"}
{"text":"Got the P&L burger and it was really good.  The patty was thick and juicy and cooked to a medium rare.  Onion jam was really good too.  Fries are thick cut and not too greasy.  I would come back.  Will take pictures next time."}
{"text":"I had the Castor.  Delicious! My boyfriend had The P & L which was also good but I liked mine better.  We also had the poutine which wasn't very good.  The fries tasted burnt or something."}
{"text":"Learn about this burger place from a show on tv, but really don't remember what's special about this place. Trying it for lunch, ordered a burger and fries combo, which came after like 10 minutes when the place is empty. (They open at 11am, and I was there like 11:10)  Burger was a bit greasy, other than that it was an okay burger. The fries are skin on fries that cooked to a bit darken state, feels like they are cooked in some older oil...   Will try this place again soon to experience other combinations for burger and hopefully have a better time."}
{"text":"So my pal and I ventured to P&L Burger this afternoon. We waited in a fairly long line along the wall (which you can draw on with washable markers) for about ten minutes. The lineup was mostly comprised of hipster-y young men with a smattering of business-minded folks. As in the case of its predecessor, White Squirrel Snack Shop, there was minimal seating, and would not be ideal for the claustrophobic customer.   We both ordered the Castor Burger and brought it home, close-by. My friend's fry-cup wasn't even close to filling up to the brim, which was disappointing. The fries, however, were decent. Onto the burgers - they were fantastic. Charred on the outside, juicy and drippy on the inside. Topped with peameal bacon, cheddar cheese, mayo and BBQ sauce, the burger is hefty but not vomit-inducingly so. Bun is substantial and sturdy enough to support the wonderful cast of players, and upon further research is made by local Silverstein Bakery - my personal favourite.   On a strip of Queen Street saturated with burger joints and in close proximity to \"burger corner\", P&L is a standout. Looking forward to trying out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a recommendation.  The burger was char broiled and still moist.  I ordered the castor with fries.  I give the burger a 9.5 out of 10.  The bun had great flavour and seemed quite fresh. Fries an 8 out of ten.  I will be back to try more.  Namely the poutine an milkshakes.  I saw a poutine and the curds were massive!  The only negative I could find is lack of seating.  There is like ten seats approx.     Enjoy it!"}
{"text":"We are on the hunt for the BEST BURGER in Toronto! Stop #8: The P&L Burger  If you're familiar with widely entertaining internet cooking shows, you're familiar with Matty Matheson. This is why I was excited as a school girl to try out his burger joint, The P&L burger. It's an admittedly oddly shaped restaurant, as it's pretty cramped width wise, but rather long. Bring yourself, and maybe 2 other friends, because seating is minimal.  This time around I kept it simple and just got a burger. The cashier's suggestion for the bests they had to offer was a burger called The P&L. Before diving into the burger description, I feel compelled to say that they forgot about my group's order, then after being reminded of it, forgot about mine specifically. They're nice guys, and I'm sure it was just a mix up, but hey, I was a bit miffed. The P&L isn't a flashy looking burger. It's served on a sesame seed bun, with a beef patty, cheddar, lettuce, dill pickle mayo, and bacon-onion jam. The sesame bun was perfectly fine, but it showed that it wasn't made in-house, (plus you could see the bags of buns in the back). I also expected something a little special in the patty, considering the burger was ostensibly designed by high profile chef. Instead I got a pretty regular patty, which again, is perfectly fine. What I enjoyed quite a bit was that bacon-onion jam. Despite being a jam, it isn't all that sweet, and its flavour hints at a Jamaican influence. It was definitely the most interesting part of the burger, and gave it a little bit of that special quality.  I'd say The P&L can be summed up as \"perfectly fine\". Nothing was at all bad, and it was tasty. That being said, I was little disappointed considering that we're on the hunt for the BEST BURGER, and I trusted Matty to do me right. Look out for the final rankings in our last stop on the hunt; The Works."}
{"text":"Trying the P&L, Priest and Gangster Burger joints have been on my to do list. I ordered the classic P&L burger - as recommended by the rude, unenthusiastic cashier - a side of fries and my s/o ordered the Cheeseburger. The total came up to a little over $25 - which was not worth it in my opinion. We took the orders to go, but ate it within a few minutes as our car was parked right outside.  Taste wise, the fries were okay. Not the best but I was hungry so they did the job. The P&L Burger was disgusting. Simply put, McDonald's Big Mac is so much better than this... and I hate McDonald's.  TLDR; Overpriced. Shitty service. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered the deluxe and my husband ordered the Castro. Fries were fresh potato cut and the fountain pop was free refills (important to the husband who was very thirsty).   Not the greatest spot to sit if you try to eat there as you are on a stool staring at a white wall but I guess I got to focus on eating really well.   We thought it was funny that the menu was a little different than what was on the wall but since it was painted on they haven't painted an update yet. We found this out after ordering but maybe ask what's available when you go..."}
{"text":"Being a huge Burger's Priest fan, I was a bit disappointed to find they close for 'church' on Sundays, so my friends opted for the P&L a few doors down. Boy, do I not regret it. I got the Philly burger to go, and everything was in perfect harmony. From the caramelized onions and mushrooms, to the jalapeno peppers that gave it that perfect KICK, the burger's toppings were delicious and well rounded out.  However, the true star of the burger was the burger patty. Deliciously meaty and crumbly with a bit of crisp char from the grill, it is definitely the best beef patty I've eaten in a WHILE. Not dry at all, perfectly cooked. There wasn't much more I could ask for. The bun was good - a bit big in my opinion - but a good enough vessel for all of the wet ingredients.  All I gotta say is that if BP and P&L teamed up, they could potentially make the best burger known to man (with BP's deep fried mushroom stuffed with cheese and P&L's patty). It is definitely something that needs to happen, stat/"}
{"text":"Cant believe it took so long to knock P L Burgers off my list of burger must. The wait was worth it, I went with the Castor.  Its was a nice juicy 6oz with peameal bacon and bbq sauce, mixed in with mayo made it really tasty.   Price point isn't too bad 13 buck for a good burger. Drink and onion rings   I heard the fries did fall short for a few other reviewers so I decided to avoid them and go for the onion rings which weren't that good.  I would rate then 5 but the lacking side and limited space were things I couldn't really let go."}
{"text":"Loveeee. Mind you, I went right when it opened so I didn't have to line up or wait long for my food. Got some good burgers here!"}
{"text":"By far the best burger I've had. Better than the others on the Queen Street strip. Their shakes are pretty good too!"}
{"text":"The burger is good but thats it.  There is no Fuks given to the atmosphere and similar with the crews attitude.  The register girl went to smoke out front and her smoke came right into the space where I was eating ( I hesitate to say restaurant,  cause its hardly that."}
{"text":"When you want to indulge in a burger, you might as well go all out. And the burgers here are the cream of the crop. Plus, as an aside, go for the onion rings over the fries, as others have mentioned. While the fries are nothing special, the onion rings were crispy and super satisfying (plus, the onions didn't overwhelm the batter, which is always a plus in my books).  We visited on a weekday around lunchtime and it wasn't busy at all. We found street parking for free on a small side street just 2 blocks west of the restaurant. Service was friendly, and because there weren't many customers around, our food came out pretty quickly. We ordered: a) The Castor, b) The Philly, c) fries, and the aforementioned onion rings.   Think of thick, juicy patties, the kind you see in commercials but you're never sure can be real life. The burgers were very tasty, soft, great to look at, and full of flavour. Nothing tasted artificial at all. The cheese was perfectly melted, and the meat was cooked perfectly. Unlike others, I didn't find this too messy to eat (and I was wearing white!). The Philly in particular had a nice kick to it (stuffed with delicious pickled jalapenos). Super fresh, and very delicious burgers.   Overall, great burgers and an awesome meal. My only gripe would be the sub-par fries, and perhaps the price, which, in the aggregate, cost us more than we thought it would. For two people, with tax, we paid around $30 (no drinks)."}
{"text":"Had the The Deluxe with P&L Sauce. It was really good. Cheese and all toppings were tasty and didnt get lost with everything else on the burger. Perfect for a quick bite. I still prefer a bar atmosphere like Tall Boys burgers for the same price but this filled the gap."}
{"text":"Aside from the now closed Wall Street Burger Shoppe on Water Street in NYC, the P&L burger is the best burger I've ever had.  The sauce, freshly grilled patty, soft buns - it's just perfect flavor and texture all around and moist but not greasy.  Much better than Burger's Priest or Shake Shack in my opinion."}
{"text":"Favourite char-broiled burger I've had so far.  I think it still comes down to the preference of flat top burger cooking over char broiled.  I think this place falls into my top 3 or 5 burger places in the city. What helps prop up the burger is the toppings they use. They an excellent variety and enhance your burger experience.  Prices around $8-9 which is pricey and an additional $3 for a combo (fries + fountain drink) so be prepared.  The layout is very long and narrow so there's only about 10-14 seats.  I do recommend trying this place but be aware that Burger's Priest is just a few doors east. There is competition... but I'm sure this place will hold their own... especially for those who prefer char-broiled."}
{"text":"Messy burger. However the taste makes up for it. Its quite juicy and fresh. Had the philly had a lot more mayo than I liked yet was very flavourful and satisfying; tasting like a philly cheese steak sandwich."}
{"text":"Great place! Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the burger was not as good as the one from their main restaurant... I like medium rare and thats why I always go to Parts but it was a bit over done. All in all I love P and L"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed in the burgers. The meat patty to bread proportion seemed way off. It was tasty, but I was also getting mouthfuls of just bread. Fries were decent. I also got a Caesar salad and most of the lettuce was yellow.  I won't come back here again."}
{"text":"I'm sad about this, I went to this place so stoked to try this burger. I'm a Matty Matheson fan, and I can't seem to get a table at P&L, so I hit up his burger spot one afternoon. It just .... wasn't good, the patty lacked seasoning which astonishes me as i've seen these burgers prepared before (but on youtube, and by the actual owner) and he seasoned the crap out of the patty.... this was unexpected. My burger was supposed to have pickle on it.... guess they forgot... fries were cold... everything was just like depressing and flavorless. Almost like the staff didn't give a crap. Thats rough I know, just how I felt..... it's a pass... now I have doubts if I want to keep trying to go to P&L :("}
{"text":"One of my fav burger joints in the city.  Not as good as burgers priest or burgernator but up there for sure."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers!! I really enjoyed P&L's burgers and their unique location. A really cute store. I'll definitely return for more! They were flavourful and interesting."}
{"text":"Good food,  but they are really really slow..   Insanely slow.   I think they recently started with uber eats,  and they obviously take priority over the actual  customers in the store.  Don't go until they fix this."}
{"text":"Riding off the business success since appearing in and winning a Burger Wars episode, Parkdale's Parts and Labour diner opened this Queen West burger-focused takeout satellite location. Great, because Dangerous Dan's got attitude issues but no tissue, and my first date with the severely overrated Burger's Preist left me unimpressed. (You are free to read my other reviews for the lack of regard harboured for those two losers, but lest I digress.)  Opening up in the Queen/Spadina area means they already have some stiff saturated competition to contend wih from established burger names on the block, like McDonald's, Hero, and yes bloody hell, the new Queen West offshoot of BP. But one first bite of the signature P&L burger tells me they can hold their own here.  Holy burger-flippin mooseball crapcakes, that's one mad grease bomb I ingested. And I loved every bite of this giant greasy juicy mess. The Castor is also good, but the Philly is my favourite. If you love having a spicy kick to your patty, then the Philly's concoction of mushrooms and jalapeños ought to shut you up and make you stop worshiping those other burger guys down the street.  A doodle wall should keep you occupied while you wait. Orders are picked up at the very back when your number is called. All burgers are $8-9, and throw in some fries and a soda for $3 more, not so bad on the gourmet burgers scale. (Though apparently they cannot add extra toppings, but no problem with subtraction.) Seating in this narrow space is limited to a small handful along two bar tables.  Having been on a search for the best greasy burger in Toronto that doesn't leave me fuming, P&L is definitely a strong contender in my books to recommend others to.  {TTC: the 501er to Augusta Ave. P&L arguably got the brightest sign on the block.}"}
{"text":"I would give 3.5, no option for 1/2 stars!  Burger was good, had a few better in the city.  Beats waiting in line for the 'other' place if it's  busy..."}
{"text":"Not convinced.  Burgers were average and disappointing compared to many other places in the city, especially in this price range.   We had 2x P&L burgers, one being the gluten-free option: wrapped in kale (no-bun).   My one with bun was well cooked and put together (didn't fall apart!), with a nice crust to the burger. The bun had a nice glaze and was fluffy, but tasted cheap like those fluorescent white buns sold in big grocery stores. The cheese tasted cheap too, kind of like Kraft cheddar.    The kale for the gluten-free version wasn't de-stemmed and was very difficult to eat. Fries not great either, too many burnt ends and tasted like they were cooked a while ago and refried.  The staff couldn't tell us what kind of meat the beef was except that they \"think it is local\". With this being priced and sold as a gourmet burger, they should know this information and use high quality meat and other ingredients.  I will stick to Big Smoke Burger, my current go-to place, and would consider Dangerous Dan's for this type of cheaper meal at a fairer price."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a third star just because there are refills on pop!  Burger was big. I got the P&L which supposedly won an award on burger wars...I didn't like the bacon and onion jam....now that I think about it, I should have gotten the one with the canadian bacon.  The fries were really disappointing...they were soggy...I don't know how that could have resulted.  The oil definately needs to be changed.  Cramped space, and I wasn't a fan of the writing on the wall (literally)...In terms of size though, you get more here in the burger compared to the measley patty over at Burger Priest down the street."}
{"text":"WOW! Was i surprised at how good this burger was. Can def compete with burgers priest with better prices. Charred but soft beef. Had the philly with poutine. Poutine was great but man the burg was ridic."}
{"text":"One of The Best Burgers I've Ever Had! We are talking Next to a Burgers Priest Burger! My Dear friend Jessie told me to go to P&L Burger and I trust him! So I did! I got the Deluxe Burger, took a bite and Was in Heaven! P&L Burger just hit my #2 Spot for Best Burger Places in Toronto! It is located On Queen and Spadina close to a Burgers Priest! LoLoL I will definitely come back to P & L Burger!"}
{"text":"Another nice good thing about P&L is that they have good food. I mean the priest burger was much tasty than the other burgers. But I dont like the hipster ambiance which is not my type. Good for lunch - yest, I like the lunch menu here, the burgers are made into perfection that's why people love this place. The kids also love this place so whenever I had the time, I always took them here."}
{"text":"Ordered The Castor combo with onion rings to go. The rings were soggy and overly salty, the burger was smothered in BBQ sauce and not a trace of lettuce of onions. Then to top it off, the burger patty was very pink, almost red!   Definitely not impressed, I recommend eating at Burgers Priest down the street instead."}
{"text":"stayed in and ordered P&L through hurrier service.  bought \"the P&L\" and \"the deluxe\" with a poutine.  the beef patties were extremely under seasoned, the burgers were very bland. not sure if the seasoning was missed on my order considering this place has pretty good reviews.  wouldnt try again and wouldnt recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"Wasn't worth all the hype and a little disappointing. Was just here on the weekend after the 10K run so I was starving. Usually when you're starving, everything tastes amazing. I ordered the Deluxe Burger but when when I ordered it, I was told they were out of regular bacon and they would give me peameal bacon instead (that's always a plus). My girlfriend wanted to try the Fried Chicken Burger so she ordered that. It was after they took our order and sat down waiting, that the gentleman walked over and informed us that they were also out of the Fried Chicken and told us to order something else. I'm not really impressed with how they can be sold out of popular items from the menu on the weekend.   When the burger did come, I found that the patty had no taste to it and that it was very blain. I ordered my burger with no pickles, yet still got pickles in my burger (not impressed). The bread was kinda big, with a thick top piece and a small thin bottom bun. Near the end, I could pretty much feel my thumb holding onto the patty. The toppings and sauce itself was very plain, wasn't very tasteful and offered no help. I was hoping that this burger would have that special taste/kick to make me come back again. The fries were decent and I liked them, you can tell they're from fresh cut potatoes. However, if you don't like soggy fries, you probably won't like them.  Overall, disappointed with this place and I won't return. There are better burger joints out there."}
{"text":"Decent burger. Not really worth the hype.  Burger was overcooked, a bit too charred and nothing really stood out about it. Would I eat it again? Probably not. The burger game in TO is way, way up there (as it is in every big city) so to call P&L Burger decent is fair. It's nothing spectacular, but the competition is strong out here."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place. It's not as good as Burger's Priest but it's a pretty close call.   All the burgers are $9 except the plain which is $8. Add $3 to make it a combo with a decent amount of fries (better to share) with free fountain refills.   I got the Deluxe burger while my friend got the P & L which is apparently award winning. The rest of menu consisted of 4 other signature burgers.   Gluten free option available but its not a bun! They wrap your burger with lettuce. FYI.   The burgers were beautiful. The buns were like fluffy fascinators on top of meat, cheese and vegetables. The burger was juicy and cooked perfectly to merge with sauce, melty cheese and crispy vegetables. I like how they used iceberg lettuce and red onions.   I only wished the bun was a little bit thinner. I couldn't finish the whole bun.   Be prepared to use a lot of napkins! These burgers are messy and you'll probably be licking your wrists."}
{"text":"Awful pretty much sums it up. To start, the cashier was less than enthusiastic and the food did the same to me. I had the fish burger with fries and both were terrible. The burger had basically just a piece of deep fried fish with a bit of iceberg lettuce. Tasteless. Fries were not crispy and also had no flavor. Can definitely not recommend anyone this place. My first and last visit. Worst burger in Toronto"}
{"text":"P&L is situated along a row of many burger joints along Queen boasting a lot of competition. And I have to admit, they can hold their own. I would go so far to say they are arguably better then the priest... (lightning strike me now...)  I have been a few times and tried three different burgers that they offer, but I would say the eponymous \"P&L\" it the best of the lot.   Bottom line - a great place to grab a burger on the go - highly recommended..."}
{"text":"I wasn't that impressed with the burgers. Perhaps I am being a burger snob, but they werent anything special.   I ordered the deluxe and it reminded of me of McDonalds (IMO) , the bacon was good. My stupid partner is arguing with me right now, because he says it is nothing like McDonalds.   The star of the show is the poutine. If you like original poutine, I prefer this over poutinis. Some may say I'm being outrageous.   Let's see."}
{"text":"P&L burgers are the best I ever had. I specially like the one with pea-meal bacon on. Unfortunately  I don't believe it's gets the fame it deserves and hope in time it starts to get the rightful attention it should get. Keep on the good work!"}
{"text":"It seems like I just criticised burger's priest (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-burgers-priest-toronto-4 and http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-burgers-priest-toronto) for not living up to the hype surrounding them. Given my disappointment with burger's priest just this weekend, I was still on the hunt for a good burger. If anything, my determination had redoubled from the letdown.  Hype is a double-edged sword. It is a tricky tango partner. As I was informed by the incredibly friendly dude behind the cash, the namesake P&L burger won best burger of the city. The Castor is featured in Toronto Life. The original restaurant, P&L, is also critically acclaimed. In a single word, H Y P E.  Spoiler: that glob of hype belongs squarely on Queen St West, slightly past Spadina, on the south side of the street. Right here at P&L. The P&L hype is well-placed and well-deserved.  I'm glad I decided to give this place a try after eyeing them for over half a year. I sprung for the Castor, since it had peameal bacon, and I try to over-Canadaise whenever I'm at home to make up for the fact that I'm south of the border for most of the year. The entire menu (with like one exception) is $10 + tax, which (despite how stupid it sounds) really makes looking at the menu pleasant. Usually I'm trying to do mental gymnastics juggling what sounds good to my stomach versus what sounds good to my wallet. Here, I could just go with the stomach! Unleash the hungry hungry hippo living in my brain!  The Castor: a patty with peameal bacon, cheese, crispy onions, lettuce, and barbecue sauce (I don't like mayo, sorry). Minus the lettuce, because who really cares about lettuce except for A+ foodies, I have comments on each part of this burger: - the patty: so tender, so juicy. Like a ripe pear. But made out of cow. A ripe cow. - the peameal bacon: salty, slightly chewy, and much better than normal bacon, let's be honest. - the cheese: gooey and warm and melty and stringy. you know on pizza commercials when they lift a slice of pizza off the pizzapan and little strings of cheese cling to it? I thought that was only real in commercials. But that's what happened with this burger and my mouth. - the onions: honestly, not very oniony (hey, I keep it real ok), but the crispiness adds a nice texture to the whole experience. - the barbecue sauce: now, usually, I am not a fan of barbecue sauce. Actually when I initially received my burger, I took one look at it and internally kicked myself for not realising that I should have asked to hold the bbq sauce. But then I took a conceding bite and... it's like barbecue sauce, but a little spicy. That kick of flavour negated my internal self-kick. Well played, P&L, well played. - bonus points... the bun: lightly toasted and slightly crispy on the outside, but still soft on the inside. Overall verdict: here's a burger I wouldn't mind smelling like for the rest of my life.  The space is not really anything special, but satisfactory enough to sit down, hang out, and eat that burger delicious bite by delicious bite. You better believe I ate that sucker slowly."}
{"text":"Great burger ! But the only thing preventing this from making this a 5 star is the extremely rude lady taking the order at 1030pm this Friday night. I felt odd and uncomfortable making an order as if I'm inconveniencing her. Clearly anger issues slamming the payment machine on the counter. Thought it was just me but a few others waiting for their orders were also talking about it. Folks that don't want to be customer facing simply shouldn't"}
{"text":"Pretty good burger (the veggie option anyway - and they have a veggie topping combo that's not listed on the menu for some reason) and I love their malted milkshakes. Fries and all that are good, too... And better than Priest's a few doors down, in my opinion.   Two things though: go before noon or line up forever. And I think they do online orders or something cuz we've been twice where we were the first people in there (for takeout) and still waited half an hour for our food."}
{"text":"Stopped in while strolling down Queen Street on a Sunday.  The place was packed, which is usual for that area.  Waited a bit for my burger.  Took a bite out of it and it was still bleeding.  I don't know about other people, but I like my hamburger meat cooked all the way through.  They gave me my money back, but not before stating that all their burgers are cooked this way.  It does not say this on the menu and she did not tell me either.  I'm sure the burger would have been good had it been cooked all the way, but the bleeding turned me off."}
{"text":"Such a chill environment and the food are delicious!!! The burgers are worth the price such a nice taste and delicious. Also kale Cesar was totally awesome!!!! Way better than burgers priest!!! The only thing I didn't like was the design of the place lol."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with co-workers.    Food: I ordered the Deluxe.  The burger was great (the sauce made it extra tasty).  The smell and the taste made me feel like I was eating \"home-made\".  The taste of high quality meat, nothing processed... Cost the burgers are pricey~$10 plus $3 for fries, $4 for onion rings...  Locale: The place is very small, and not great for eating in.  Since the burgers are cooked on the spot, it also takes ~15 minutes for the food to be done.   Update: Went and order the P&L burger.  It was great, juicy and super tasty.    4 Star due to the cost."}
{"text":"So,  I know here in Toronto there's  a hype for burgers.  Competition is good, as we get to see these burger joints improve their product to gain customers.  Unfortunately,  in  the case of p&l,  it ain't the case.  If you are paying almost 15 bucks for a burger with fries,  you expect a tasty product with good quality meat (I took the Castor and the bread was chewy plus the meat not properly cooked).  This said, I'm quite disappointed with this,  but at the same time I shouldn't be surprised as hipster over-priced restaurants in this part of the city are the rule.  Anyway,  I won't go back.  I rather go to burgers priest or to Loblaws for sushi.."}
{"text":"Burger is decent, but nothing special. The philly is pretty good. Fries are thicker cut, but not as crispy as i like.   The cashier (blonde girl with tattoos) is pretty terrible. Definitely very short with you when you ask questions. Sounded like she was doing me a favor by answering me."}
{"text":"Ok..... so I came into P&L with some pretty high hopes. I had heard all about them and thought it was time to give them a try. Well...... I ordered the Castor..... because, well..... you had me at Peameal Bacon...... and I loves me some BBQ sauce. Ps - the fries are pretty big.... so if you're with a friend.... and neither of you are greedy bitches.... you could totally share them. Now..... please read all the way through to get the full experience..... it'll change the way you est lunch on Queen W.   My first few bites...... Meh! I've gotta say. I was impressed by one fact however. You know when you're eating a burger and the toppings are falling out of the bun.... well, MEAT was falling out. You can't go wrong with too much meat!   But the flavour left me wanting more. I couldn't figure out where the best part of the burger was. It just tasted kinda.... greasy. Then I pulled it open and saw that most of the flavours are placed above the patty..... so I tried something new..... wait for it..... I flipped the burger over and continued to eat it upside down!   MIND BLOWN!!!!! THERE'S THE FLAVOUR I WAS LOOKING FOR!!!!! That BBQ sauce was so delicious... with just the right amount of kick, the crunch of the Crispy onions, and not to forget the fromage! Mmmmmm. Was sooooo good, I can't wait to go back.... and turn dinner upside down before digging in!"}
{"text":"As far as small burger places go this place is ok. The burger itself is great and filling  (I got the fried chicken burger) however the environment is very low key (more of a take out place) and the service is slow.  Side note - if you are a fan of cream soda this place has it as part of its drinks selection."}
{"text":"Burgers were really tasty and prepared to highest standards but I didn't care about the onion rings. Too soggy and inconsistent."}
{"text":"VIBE  Super hipster = cool sign, stark walls on one side/graffiti on the other, and staff in plaid/cool labelled t-shirts and toques. Bar and stools in the front and at the back. Burgers on the menu and pumping rock music on the speakers. Surprise!   I ATE  The P+L Burger. Seems to be their classic. I don't know. I couldn't eat all of it. Something was lacking. That said, their sides are FANTASTIC. The gravy and fries are perfect; and the dill pickle is big and juicy, just like in my food porn fantasies.  Not worth the wait (and you do wait but not as long as at Burger's Priest). I may go back for the Castor.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Honestly, I'd go to the original location in Parkdale for thei P+L burger but if its sides you're looking for and you're in the area go here. If you want a burger, go to Burger's Priest. And if you don't want to wait go to Banh Mi Boys or McDonald's. I think I have the area covered. :)"}
{"text":"I don't know how this burger went from the best burger in Toronto in my books to one of my worst burger experiences in recent memory. I think I'm done with P&L after this experience. My mouth is still reeling from the shock of the amount of salt in the Castor burger. What is with all the salt??? This is the second time I've had a bad  experience.  Burger was overcooked but the saltiness was mind blowing. See ya P&L...I'm sticking with Burgers Priest now."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, and I'm not a burger person.   Maybe I'm not a burger person because I just haven't had a good burger yet. But boy, this was a good burger. Came here for a late lunch after a tough workout and ordered the Castor burger - peameal bacon, crispy onion bits, shredded lettuce, mayo, and BBQ sauce with the requisite beef patty and bun. Also comes with a slice of cheddar but I opted out. The set-up and overall atmosphere of the place makes it feel like a bustling fast-food place but it did take between 5 to 10 min for my order to be ready. But the food should not be compared to fast food burger joints. The burger was awesome! I'm usually underwhelmed by burgers but all the ingredients in this one played perfectly with one another and were great on their own. The peameal bacon was perfect, the BBQ sauce was delicious, and the crispy onions added that extra dimension to it. But I was most impressed by the beef patty. They're hand-formed and seasoned well. The flat top grill also gives it an awesome exterior crunch and flavour that is something special. Another reason why I'm not a big burger fan is because they always fall apart and get really messy, and this one was no different but it was delicious so I didn't even care. They've got plastic knives and forks for your fries and inevitable burger collapse. My one criticism is that they have just one garbage can and no recycling/compost. All the paper liners, plastic utensils, soft drink cups, and food waste go into one garbage can. It's not a terribly large space but I think they've got enough to spare for a slightly more responsible garbage system.   I'll be back for another!"}
{"text":"The first time I went I was terribly disappointed but the 2nd (and then 3rd) I was super satisfied with the Deluxe burger. They've changed for the better. Amazing. Glad I gave it another try."}
{"text":"Wow. This is the best burger I've EVER had.   Forget Burger Priest and everything else in Toronto. If your in the city, you must try this burger. I hardly write reviews, but I had too for this burger!  Everything is perfect, texture, taste, cheese, bread, toppings. I got the P&L Burger.   Also recommend gravy with the fries."}
{"text":"The Fried Chicken Burger was alright. The fried chicken wasn't as crunchy than I expected. Also, I was able to ask for extra sauce on my burger which was nice. Service was nice too. Seating is very limited. Next time I might try their Castor Burger."}
{"text":"The Pay & Lineup Burger... Just kidding its not that bad.   I happened to park next to the restaurant while waiting for a friend and decided to try it based on all the positive feedback I'd heard about it.   I went in the early afternoon, but still had to wait to order and receive my burger. I ordered the castor because it seems to be the most recommended.   The burger was very delicious and the peameal bacon sold me. It really took the burger from a 3/5 to a 4/5. I also personally prefer a bun that can hold its own, so that factored in as well.   All in all, I think it is a great burger place and I would definitely visit again to try one of their Chef's Burger creations."}
{"text":"Still a fan but it's not as good anymore. I don't know how to explain it but it just hasn't been living up to my expectations. Sometimes the burger is very greasy, other times it's too salty.  I had to fast for a medical procedure so I hadn't eaten in 1.5 days - a feat for me - and this was the first stop once I was okayed to eat. It hit the spot because I was so hungry but we've not been back since :(  Please get some consistency!! I really want to love you with all my heart again."}
{"text":"Thick, solid, juicy, tight. I'm getting way too excited. What was I talking about? Oh right, the burgers. Very good. I really liked the onion rings here, too. Service seemed indifferent, but whatever the burger was good. My only beef with it is it was too bunny (get it? beef!). I want my hamburger buns to get out of the way. It's only purpose should be to hold the patty and toppings together, nothing more. Too much bun absorbs the flavour, and that's what I find to be the case here."}
{"text":"This is an obvious 5 stars. Best burger in T.O. Excellent burgers take time. Enough time for a quick jaunt down some of graffiti alley (it's just south of Queen). I feel blessed."}
{"text":"P&L Burger is one of the better places in the downtown core to grab a juicy patty between tasty buns. I hadn't been here since last year but everything about the experience is just as I remembered it.  The dining areas are equipped with bar stool seating and the space is a narrow, open concept room that stretches from the front entrance to the kitchen in the back. Service is generally fast and friendly and the burgers come quickly, cooked perfectly to order.  Must try items: The P&L Burger The Philly  Branding, decor and visual consistency bring everyone together at P&L. The burger lineup is solid, focusing on classic combinations of toppings, done creatively.   The meat quality is great and the burgers literally stack up to rival establishments in terms of size and taste. The french fries might be the only aspect in need of improvement. Either way, I highly recommend checking them out."}
{"text":"The castor burger that I bought from P&L was very juicy. The bottom bun was still moist when I opened up the wrapper. I'm not a fan of that. However, the burger itself was pretty good and you can still taste the char on the burger when you bite into it. I would say that it's better than Burger's Priest, and the lineup is much shorter.  There are quite a number of barstool seats inside the restaurant, but it's just as easy to order and pickup to go."}
{"text":"The burgers at P&L are simply wonderful.  In my book, Burger's Priest was unmatched in the city, but P&L proves to be a fierce competitor. Cool venue also."}
{"text":"Got the namesake burger for $9, which for the size was totally worth it but as far as taste goes, which the beef was juicy and tender, it also ran on the salty side. The poutine came out lukewarm and the cheese curds weren't melting, also a little on the saltly side. The coleslaw was ok. Service was friendly and speedy.  If this place was located not so close to Burger's Priest, I'd go back and eat there again but alas I think I'll make my way to BP instead. The Priest reigns supreme."}
{"text":"3.5   Great burger, but not my favorite. I got the Castor burger, which is a cheeseburger with pemeal bacon. It was a tasty burger, but in my opinion Holy Chucks & Five guys is better. I just felt the burger was missing something, and in a city that is dominated by burger places, I feel like it almost has to be a home run.   I will have to go back to try a different burger because I took someone's advice on what burger to order and should have gone with my gut on what I like.   The staff were really nice though and it's still a pretty good burger nonetheless."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of P & L Burger after trying their original burger at Parts & Labour. I heard they opened a place specifically for their burgers after winning Burger Wars, so I decided to check it out. I had the Deluxe and a chocolate milkshake. It was moist, juicy and full of flavor. You can definitely tell the ingredients were fresh! The milkshake was tasty- not too sweet, not too milky.   My only setback was I think my order may have been mixed up (it didn't seem to be what I had ordered). I tried some of the fries my friend ordered and wasn't a huge fan. Also had a lack of seating like most of these burger joints do."}
{"text":"I just started interning on Queen West and decided that my summer quest is to try all the fancy burger places offered...so I started with P&L!   I've been intrigued by this place for quite some time, having walked by it on numerous occasions and knowing that there's only one location.  The girl that was working was named Andrea and she was super nice and helpful. My friend and I tend to be a little indecisive and were constantly going over all the options. She made some good recommendations and was very patient with us.  I ended up ordering just the hamburger. Since I don't eat cheese I would have had to order any of the other ones without, and I wasn't feeling anything too crazy.  They accidentally made me the wrong one, so since I had to wait a few extra minutes they threw in some fries which was a nice touch and shows good customer service because I didn't expect anything nor was I annoyed by any means  having to wait a bit longer.  The burger was really delicious and I loved the P&L sauce. It was big and extremely filling. The bun was pretty 'bready' but it was worth eating the extra carbs ;) they had an option on the menu to replace the bun with kale for no extra charge but I didn't know how that would go over so I decided not to take the risk.        There were 2 places to sit and we picked the back which I kind of regret because it was mirrored and it's really awkward to sit in front of a giant mirror and eat...at least for me!  Will definitely be returning after I successfully complete my Queen West burger mission!!"}
