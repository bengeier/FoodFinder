{"text":"I usually love supporting small businesses and \"eating local\" but I think I'll drive a half mile down the road and get my subs at Jersey Mikes from now on. My boyfriend got a small sub with salami and pepperoni on it, all the way, and you could hardly see the meat on it because there was barely any!! Usually we just let things like that go, but it has happened the last few times, so he decided to tell the owner. He politely said that he thought the sandwich should have a little bit more meat on it in the future because it seemed a little skimpy this time. The owner followed back with \"the salami and pepperoni are sliced very thin, there's a total of 8 slices on there\" (there were 6, plus 2 thin slices of cheese). All this time I thought that \"the customer is always right\"... I guess that's not true here! If the meat is sliced so thin, wouldn't it make sense to put more slices on the sandwich? It's a shame because the food tastes pretty good, but we will definitely not be supporting this small business owner in the future."}
{"text":"Ordered several sandwich trays recently for work events.  I was able to get it customized and add potato and macaroni salad, chips, and cookies.  Included set ups and fixings.  Prompt delivery and always very friendly and professional.  Food is fresh and tastes great!"}
{"text":"Great little sandwich shop I just stumbled over. Quick clean fresh and delicious, I love when I can find a good local place that isn't a chain."}
{"text":"I recently moved back to the Charlotte area.  I stopped into Crown Town Subs by chance a couple of weeks ago. Amazing sub!!! Great service!!! Clean!!! Friendly staff!!!! I have been back two times and each time the same experience. I was in today for lunch and saw on the wall they have a mission statement ...\"personal service in an impersonal world...\" and set of values all focused on customer experience and commitment to service. This is my new regular sub place. Great food and great service. I highly recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"Love this sub shop! I began eating here for lunch because my job relocated nearby. I enjoy their selection here and the service is excellent each time I've been. Friendly, quick staff provide a great lunch and give me the energy to finish out the day!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since 2005 when it was Sub Station II. Bottom line: this is the best sub you will EVER eat. The bread is excellent and I honestly don't know what else makes the sub so dang good. I honestly think it's just the way they layer it. They also cut their meats and cheeses fresh. #5 is my favorite sandwich on the planet."}
{"text":"Simple but tasty fresh ingredients. Very happy with the meat to bread ratio, maybe they took the previous reviews and did something better? Overall, will gladly support this small local business going forward !"}
{"text":"Just finished a Classic Club. It was excellent! Crispy toast and lettuce, great flavor in the meats & tomato, crunchy bacon: Fantastic! Nice folks in an extremely clean restaurant. Will definitely recommend & go back as often as possible!"}
{"text":"Visited for the 1st time yesterday...... great variety, fresh bread, went for the crown town assorted, and the cheeseburger.....loved both, we will return...(ps, if your from Buffalo NY, looking for closest sub to what your used to.....this is it!).... great folks, friendly....give them a try!"}
{"text":"This is our new go-to sub shop!  Everything tastes very fresh, from the meat to the veges to the bread - just delicious!  To top it off, the owners are so very nice.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was the worst sandwich I have had in a very long time.   I got a reuben sandwich which should be pretty typical.  The meat was lunch meat and not grilled.   The bread was toasted???  WT?? Who does that?  Apparently Sub Station II!   Will not be going back here anytime soon.  what a sorry excuse for a sandwich place."}
{"text":"We started going when it was Sub Station II and loved it! So fresh and tasty waay better and about the same price as Jersey Mikes and Firehouse. Now that they have switched to Crown Town we still love it! I think it's the same owner and he kept the same staff, the food is the same too! We are so pleased to have found a fantastic hometown sub shop in the city!!"}
{"text":"I went with a s number 4 (minus pepperoni) so basically a half/small salami-sub. Well they certainly were not kidding when they said small, It was miniscule. It made a 6inch Subway sub look downright gigantic. It tasted good, but for $5.50 not including a drink or chips, I guess I expected a tiny bit more. I am not the type of person who needs quantity over quality, but I need my lunch to at least let me make it to dinner without raiding the snack machine. 

On a positive note, the service was quick and professional and it did taste good."}
{"text":"I had a French Dip which was eh, nothing special.  My friend Nicole B hated her reuben because it was toasted, which didn't even make sense. Not sure what the 3rd party had, but probably a burger which is all she eats anyway.  We regretted wasting our per diem on this place."}
{"text":"I like the freshly sliced ingredients on the subs here. Very clean operation, and quick service. Definitely a few steps above the big national chain sub places, but not super expensive. I've eaten at Sub Station II for 10 years or more and have yet to be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ordered the #13 and it was delicious. I was actually hesitant to stop by this place but when I saw the positive reviews on Yelp I dove in. Good sub place and fairly priced. The bread was unique was well..."}
{"text":"Change of name, but just the same as sub station 2. I had the number 1. Which is the ham and cheese. So good! I was in a hurry so I settled for chips as the side. Next time I'll try the potato salad. :)"}
{"text":"The place that I was taking some training from ordered our daily lunches from this sandwich shop. Based on the menu we were given to select from I figured that the school was giving us a limited selection of the full offering to keep things simple when they have to order for a couple dozen people.

After looking at the menu online I estimate that this is not the case. Sub Station II seems to be just a simple \"Ham & Cheese\" type of place. They have a selection of deli meats, a range of your typical toppings, and a few choices or bread or wrap. I don't think you're going to find a meatball or philly cheesesteak kind of sandwich here.

The first couple of days I gave the salads a go. The were kind of bland as you get a bed of shredded lettuce with pre-selected toppings and the sliced up deli meat. On the other days I gave a few sandwiches a try. They were alright. No complaints, but these subs certainly weren't anything beyond what I could make at home.

What I did like about this place was that they delivered each sandwich in its own plastic container with our sides and cookie inside. They also wrote our names on the container so when it came time to eat there was no confusion about which sandwich was which."}
{"text":"Neat little sub shop where they slice the meat when it's ordered, as opposed to Jared's big sub chain that the stuff is sliced somewhere else. So the sub I had (turkey and provolone) was fresh tasting on a nice toasty foot long... I mean... a twelve inch long... sub roll. Cut into quarters, which I wasn't expecting but I liked it.

They have the usual cold deli meats and the usual toppings, plus what look like some decent hot offerings.

It's not outstanding, but it's way better than the usual national chains and so it gets a four star review from me.

Soda fountain has Pepsi products and there are two urns of iced tea.

Free wifi!"}
{"text":"So I'm always in the mood to try something new for lunch.  A friend told me about this sub shop and I figured I'd check them out.

First off Sub Station II is a southern based franchise opportunity so each store is individually owned.  

Since I went at lunchtime and it was my first time, I didn't really have good chance to look at the their menu and all of the options so I just selected a small #5 which was turkey, ham and cheese, all the way which comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, oil and vinegar.  

The meats are sliced while you wait.  But here's the problem. they are sliced paper thin that you really don't get much.  You have to ask for extra meat to get more substance.  This is my biggest complaint about most sub places.  

The sandwich tasted good, despite the lack of meat.  There was plenty of oil and vinegar to seep into the bread which may turn some people off, but not me.  I love my bread moist! 

But price wise, this is a good place.  A decent sub, with combo for just over $7.  Not as good as Jersey Mike's or Lenny's but definitely cheaper!"}
