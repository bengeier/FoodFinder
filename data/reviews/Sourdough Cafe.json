{"text":"Food was not good.  I had the bacon, eggs and pancakes.  Bacon was cheap.  Eggs were disgusting. Pancakes were bad.   Wife had steak and eggs.  Both were gross.  Also, waiter was in attentive and rude.  Last time I come to place.  Something positive."}
{"text":"$5 steak and eggs 24/7? Hell yeah! 

I usually go to South Point for their steak and eggs special, but it is only after midnight and they recently changed it so that only those who are over 21 can get the special, which sucks! I came here with a group of 7, and they asked if anyone was over 21. We were confused since they did not have any signs or anything suggesting that anyone over 21 was needed. Luckily, we had two people over 21. She still asked for all of our IDs, which we thought was strange. She gave us a disapproving look and said that if we caused ANY trouble, she would call security and we would be kicked out. Umm....okay? Just because 5/7 of us were not 21 doesn't mean that we can't be well behaved. Whatever.

We all ordered steak and eggs, and one banana cream pie. They give you an option of toast or biscuits and gravy, so naturally, I went with the biscuits and gravy. SO YUMMY. No regrets. The steak was mediocre. They ask how you want it cooked, but all of them were served basically well done. They also give you eggs and hash browns, and they were great. They refilled our waters often and the servers were friendly, so no complaints there! 

Seriously, for $5 steak and eggs, you can't really complain much about the food. Took off one star for the rude hostess, but other than that, I would definitely recommend this place for a cheap, late night meal! Or any other time of the day, really. Seriously. 24/7 $5 steak and eggs. Really can't beat that."}
{"text":"The best steak and egg and prize is excellent. Even the dessert cheese cake taste like heaven.The hostess/ cashier are friendly. They have a summer special i recommend you to order the steak sandwich..."}
{"text":"Worse little excuse I ever saw for a steak.
When I complained everybody acted real sorry and all. Then proceeded to call security. Now I'm reminded why I never patronize casino restaurants."}
{"text":"Came here for the steak and eggs!! It says 3.99, but it actually comes out to 4.49. But that's ok. The customer service is kinda bad, It seems they're always frustrated.  

Anyways, the steak was full of nerves and fat but had good flavor. When they ask you if you want toast or biscuit in gravy, get the toast!! The biscuit in gravy is always cold and the gravy tastes like its out of a can. 

I suppose I would recommend this place, I get a lot of food for a little money, and that's good for a student on a budget!"}
{"text":"This is a staple in my eating out habits.  A friend and I got there a few times a month and always peek in the menu (mostly from habit) because we always walk in knowing that we will either get Steak and Eggs for 3.99 or Ham and Eggs for the same price.  The service is generally decent but at times is lacking especially if your cup runs dry quickly.  The servers are very willing to substitute without any hassle (something you will NOT find at the Sourdough Cafe on Boulder Highway)  

There are a few bad things.... namely -
It's in a casino and i have been turned down by friends to go there because they dont want to be in a casino 
The casino is full of smoke (others have mentioned this) you leave smelling like the inside (sometimes, even if you dont linger in the casino)
the prices on their non-specials are not worth it (always stick with a special)
the food is good but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"$3.99 for the farmhouse breakfast with biscuits and gravy. Was excellent and worth the drive to Arizona Charlie's. Fun adventure!"}
{"text":"Horrible service it took them 10 min to get our drink order in, and another 20 for our food order and when we finally got our food it was mediocre! yes it is a cheap deal but definitely not worth it!"}
{"text":"Service is a little weak, but you can't beat steak and eggs for only $3.99! My husband and I come here a lot and leave happy for what we paid for."}
{"text":"Usually a very good place to eat for value but tonight the chef was either lazy or just plain incompetent. We ordered chicken wings they came out still frozen strike one, and a dinner of steak and eggs. Steak medium rare came out rare, eggs over medium came out extra runny. How can a cook mess up eggs over medium??"}
{"text":"I love the sourdough cafe.  I'm not sayin its the best breakfast ever, but it is good and filling.  The specials are definitely worth getting the players card.  I love to get the burger special here.  That said the service can be slow at times.  

Also FYI.  If you like scrambled eggs, be sure to tell them how you want them cooked.  My GF has failed to do so multiple times and every time they come \"soft scrambled.\""}
{"text":"Best steak and egg deal I've ever found anywhere in America! Lived in vegas from 06-09 and went here often. Moved back a month ago and have been here twice. The servers are kind, the vibe is comforting, and the food leaves you with money in your pocket to gamble (or buy dessert...or whatever). It's perfect! Don't forget to leave a big tip for your server!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for a bacon cheeseburger, when it came it didn't come with any lettuce, tomato, onion or pickles when we asked our waitress about it she said you have to ask for those items. I feel the quality of the food has gone down and the prices have gone up, I see no reason to come back. We used to frequent the cafe often."}
{"text":"We stayed at Arizona Charlie's for a week. We ate at the buffet and the cafe. Deborah was our waitress 2 out of the 3 times we ate at the cafe. Exceptional customer service!!! Cheap food, quick service, great prices. We will definitely be back to eat here, mostly thanks to Deborah."}
{"text":"Decent food cheap.  Love the 3.99 ham and eggs"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our experience. Waited 20 minutes for our server. We had to get up and ask another server to find our server. Our server Donna finally showed up with a sour look on her face and said \"yeah. What can I get you\". No smile, all attitude. Food was not very good either. Won't be going back. Stay clear of this place"}
{"text":"Full menu all the time everything is 9.99 or under !!

This is a true cafe had all the cafe classics and a full bakery. They make some amazing sweets and even have it to go! !  

So your self a favor and check this place out! !!"}
{"text":"Steak and eggs for 3.99. Chix wings were also flavorful! Our server was great too!"}
{"text":"The service was slow. The coffee was not good at all. Either it was old or just plain old cheap coffee. After we ate our meal we ordered dessert. I stacked up all our dirty plates on one side of the table so the server can just pick it up. Well, unfortunately, the server gave us our dessert and didn't even picked up those dirty plates. 
I was very disappointed! You would think that they would at least clear the table before placing our desserts on the table. But no, we have to eat desserts with all the dirty plates on the table. 
The food was just ok! That's expected."}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast. Food was good, nothing special but better than your local Denny's. Price was good, service was good. Crowded and a little bit of a wait for our meal."}
{"text":"This place is okay.  The food was okay.  But the services was lacking.  3 people came over to ask if some one had ordered our drinks.  They were disorganized.  My sister and I ordered burgers.  And we got our ranch and extras for our burgers 10 minutes before we got the burger,  which was okay just kinda weird.  The one thing that bothered me the most,  was that when we got the straws for our drinks they wrappers wet."}
{"text":"My gosh the food, service & portion sizes were awesome. This is a meal I won't quickly forget. The chicken fried steak with eggs and a side of biscuit & gravy was amazing and the mushroom Swiss burger was huge and mouth watering."}
{"text":"They are so dumb the steak and eggs breakfast that made them stand out is now $7.77. It went up $3 to $4. And it's not even all that to begin with but at the price that its definately not worth $8. Not a smart move and they must be struggling now because they went from a $0 Resort fee to an $11 Resort fee for hotels. Arizona Charlie's sucks now! Not that they were ever that good to start with"}
{"text":"From 3.99 to 14.99, anyone can find something good to eat. I couldn't decide so I got the 3.99 breakfast and the 14.99 Ribeye.

Both were great deals and delicious! 

Great Food, prices, & service!"}
{"text":"Little diner with nice staff inside the casino. The prices were cheap and the food was great. I liked that it was open 24 hrs.  My only concern was that the staff was fighting amongst themselves. It didn't make me feel uncomfortable, it actually made me laugh. They were all attacking our server Kang. She was legit. Had a very thick accent but recommended good items on the menu. I would definitely eat here again. The banana split was insane. They gave me so much ice cream, it was insane."}
{"text":"Overpriced, disgusting, if you want food poisoning eat here.  Work puts my hubby at Arizona Charlies so he doesn't have the option to not eat here when he runs out of food I've packed him.  He gets sick every time he's eaten here.  The picture he sent me today of his raw chicken made me sick."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst steggs ever! About to give it to a homeless. Ordered a medium rare and got the thinnest steak for $8.49"}
{"text":"The lines go by fairly quickly, no matter the size. Very friendly staff and very helpful. If there's a questionable item that's ordered? It's taken care of without question. 
The food it's self was great. No matter what i ordered was on point. No matter the time, night or day? Got the same grwat service and the food was consistent. Which is rare! I'm definitely going to be back, even if it's to eat at this restaurant. 
Keep up the great effort and work towards customer service, and the food quality."}
{"text":"The steak was juicy but had a rim of tougher sinew--very fair for the price (about $6).  The pancake graveyard special (2 pancakes for $3) was not bad--the syrup and butter came in those sealed packets. The service was slow at 6 am but friendly.  No mobile cell signal that deep into the casino--nor is there wifi. So... best to watch ESPN over the counter or bring a book.

I thought the food was good for the price.  But overall for my steak and eggs (and pancakes) i'd rather go to Ellis Island still."}
{"text":"I been going to this place for years, since I was a young child.  While the food specials such as the well priced steak and eggs remain relatively cheap and tasty, service has gone down hill. The last time my husband and I were there we has one of the rudest servers I had ever encountered. She had a nasty attitude and let it be known.  Although this encounter at A.C. turned us off it has not completely steered us away . This restraunt is still a gem."}
{"text":"Edward fixed everything that went wrong.  Minus one star because Robin still messed things up, but Edward was such a doll.  First visit here went fine.  Second visit was a to-go order that was taken by Robin.  Most of what swayed our decision to buy here was me raving about their homemade chicken noodle soup.  I had it on my first visit here and since my friend was feeling a bit under the weather, I told him that he should try some. 
She handed us the bag and drinks and we headed back to the room.  We noticed that the soup was missing when we started emptying the plastic bag.  I sent my buddy back to get his soup.  He said he talked to the same lady and she insisted that the soup was in the bag.  Ok, we made a $30+ order, and all I'm complaining about is missing soup.  In the end she insisted it was there, and did not give the soup to my buddy even though I sent him down with my receipt, ID and the cc I used.  
I called downstairs when he got back to my room and told them I'd like to return the entire order for a refund since I am unable to get my soup.  Megan answered the phone and said she couldn't authorize that, but she would have her manager call me back.  In the meantime, we sat there with food getting cold because we were waiting on the word for it being ok to return.  I was surprised that Megan actually did have Edward call me back on my room phone.  I asked if he would authorize a return of this now-cold food for a full refund.  He said we can walk back down again and get the soup.  I said that would have been nice the first time, but it was already denied to us.  Since my one friend was already feeling sick, he said to just leave it as is, but my other friend decided she was ok to walk down and pick up the soup, so I sent her.  I didn't feel like going and I felt like if I did I would be yelling at someone.
My friend comes back, and not only did Edward throw in an extra cup of soup, he sent up some dinner rolls as well.  When I was on the phone with him, he did offer dessert, but we declined since we had been to the buffet earlier and were still feeling the guilt.  It was nice that he sent dinner rolls up, though...went nicely with the soup and no visible boogers & c*m.  (Y'all seen that South Park episode, right?)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants to eat out at only behind ihop and tgif the staff here is friendly the service is good the customer service is top notch and the food each time I come here keeps getting better and better. I just love this place and it has a relaxing atmosphere to it which is another reason for me to keep coming back I recommend this place to anyone who loves good service with a nice relaxing atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"If you can find this cafe through the smoke-infested casino and don't mind inconsistent service, this is a great place for massive portions of home cooking- and good specials.

BF has been hanging out at the AC sports book lately, so we had dinner here last night. Specials include a $10 prime rib and shrimp, $5 steak and eggs or ham and eggs, and a few others- BF preferred the prime rib dinner, which did not have shrimp but came in a larger size with soup or salad, rolls, vegetable of the day, and choice of potato. I tried his meat and it was actually surprisingly good, as was the au jus, which I usually find too salty.

I opted for the Wednesday dinner special of roasted pork loin with mashed potatoes and pan gravy with the same sides as above- meat was actually surprisingly good, but could have used a smidge more gravy. I liked the potatoes and I'm usually a little picky about them- slightly salty, seemed to me bad with smashed baby reds which are my favorite. Vegetable of the day was canned corn, which was lackluster and mostly flavorless. 

FInal note about the side salads that we started with: in addition to being rather large, they're drenched in dressing- so if you're counting calories you really should ask for it on the side. That being said, lettuce and other vegetables were crisp and fresh.

Service was a little less than impressive: took our server a good 10 minutes to approach us for the first time, he was a bit short with us, and when I asked for a cup of chili he snapped at me and said it only came in a bowl portion. Kind of annoyed about that, kind of annoyed about how he pointed it out. Either way, apparently you have to go with a bowl for chili- duly noted."}
{"text":"Sourdough Cafe: classic diner restaurant inside a locals casino. Menu is predictable, prices are low, portions are huge, quality is hit or miss. For best bets (pun intended), go for breakfast because those foods are harder to screw up. The chicken fried steak and eggs or the build your own omelet are solid choices. For other meals, proceed with caution when ordering the pastas or prime rib. While those dishes should also be hard to screw up, they've been disastrous in the past. Skip the line by checking to see if bar seating is available."}
{"text":"This hotel is inundated with smoke from old ladies on the slot machines. Other than that it is a great breakfast place. The steak and eggs w/ hashbrowns are only $3.99. The price is right. This is the cheapest steak you can get and the meal is cheaper than Denny's. Great value at an ok place. I go here with my friends at least a few times every time I am in Vegas with my friends."}
{"text":"I must say this coffee shop is a real hit or miss. I've been here multiple times. My last visit here with family was just great! The service was spot on. Linda and her bus girl were great! The food arrived in a timely manner and was very good. I had the Reuben sandwich and my wife had the build-your-own burger. This was a great experience for us. Although they did away with the 49 cent breakfast years ago, this still is a good place to get a great deal."}
{"text":"I feel every need to call the health department on this place but , I doubt that would solve any issues due to the fact that you can serve Terrible food and still get a A grade! So i got the steak and eggs with biscuits and gravy , my steak was 30% rubber or rock and the rest tasted like rat meat the server brought my bowl of biscuits and gravy with her thumb in it (barf emoji), and her nails were dirty!!!!!!!!! The sweet tea was like raspberry tea but you know they swear up and down it's sweet tea but below is my steak I spit out of my mouth because it was non edible but not even A1 sauce or Tabasco could save this horrible meal! Save your life and just go to Applebee's down the street!"}
{"text":"The portions of the steak and eggs and burger specials for players club card holders gets smaller and smaller every year. the scrambled eggs and hashbrowns here aren't that good.  however the staff is friendly, and all the other food i've tried here is great."}
{"text":"My Friend and I decided to take an adventure to Vegas and from the long drive we were exhausted and hungry. We decided to give this place a chance and see how it was. We waited in line to get seated and it took a while until a waiter appeared to get our order for our drinks. I have to say before we were seated they did warn us that it would take longer than usual to get a waiter, I guess they were understaffed. After we got our drinks we had to wait again until the waiter came back to take our order for what we wanted to eat. We decided to order their Grilled Chicken Breast Dinner. The food was incredible, it tasted like a home cooked meal you would have at grandma's place. Both of us were satisfied with our meals and could not believe this meal only cost us $9.99 in Vegas. We were so full that dessert was out of the question but we left very satisfied and all the waiting paid off with having this great meal. And if you sign up for their Rewards Card for the Casino you get a discount on your meal."}
{"text":"Located inside Arizona Charlies on the 2nd floor- this place has a great deal when it comes to food- breakfast plate 3.99. They have a burger for 5.99/6.99. I did order the prime rib for 13.99 included soup or salad with a side etc. I thought my food was tasty and the servers were very nice. The best thing was when ordering coffee they put the carafe on the table. It stayed hot and no need to waive them down to get refills. 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"I I haven't eaten here in a long time. the breakfast was hot and very good I would come back again"}
{"text":"This place is located in a pretty low end locals casino but with that said it's a fun spot for a quick & hearty breakfast. It's also super cheap! They have a fully stocked bar so having some cocktails with your breakfast is always a good idea. The menu has a little bit of everything but I think the breakfast options are the tastiest. Service is always great as well!"}
{"text":"Awesome! I am a French dip lover. And I'm constantly wanting to try from every restauraunts. This by far is one of the best next to the one at the courtyard cafe at the orleans. Also the late night specials are awesome! Oh and the fried zucchini is great!"}
{"text":"Awesome customer service experience here. I went to have dinner with my family late in the night around 1 a.m at the cafe and was served by a sweet lady called Rachel and she was awesome kind polite....absolutely wonderful.
The food was also good. I came home a happy camper and I give Rachel two thumbs way up for her seven star service!"}
{"text":"It looks like I should have read my last review before ordering the same meal almost three years later in the cafe that never changes. The shady characters still lurk here in this 24 hour coffee shop and most specials require you to flash the standard players card. The breakfast deal with the card only saves you a whopping 50 cents, so it does not seem to be a large deal. OK on this trip, I stayed away from the bar and had no pancakes. The potatoes and eggs were both improved and the whole meal really almost felt like a normal breakfast except that I was dining at 10pm. For $3.77 out the door it really is a Vegas throwback, just like this casino."}
{"text":"Good specials, okay food, service is questionable. Sometimes the cook cannot determine the degrees of doneness [well*done, over*hard...]"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible, the silverware and dishes are usually dirty still, and the service is just terrible. The food is a beast of its own, low quality ingredients, usually undercooked, and a small, very basic menu. The traffic this place gets is mainly all players using their free comps, and the quality of the cafe reflects that."}
{"text":"They use to have a really good breakfast specials, but like most of Las Vegas, the good deals that keep us coming back for the last 17 years are drying up and they have lost interest in gamblers .  The staff is still friendly but I am sure upper management will change that."}
{"text":"The food was very good, but I ordered 2 Cobb salads to go. When I arrived at my location, the salads didn't have any meat, tomatoes, bacon, or blue cheese crumbles. Also, the dressing I ordered \"on the side\" was the wrong one! I traveled quite a ways and it wasn't worth driving all the way back across town to fix. Very dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is good and the prices are awesome. We go there every single day, when we're  in Las Vegas. My daughter got the breakfast burrito. My other daughter and I shared the sampler platter and a Philly cheese steak. It was the best I've had. Both my grandson had ham and eggs. All of us we're very happy with our choices. Even though we actually stayed at the Decaunter location, we left because the manager didn't want to hold our luggage for an hour upon checkout. If it wasn't for his rudeness we would've eaten at that location. Oh well his loss. Boulder highway is the best. Can't wait to try more items on the menu. Yummy"}
{"text":"ZERO STARS for Arizona Charlies Boulder Sourdough Cafe ZERO STARS
Last month my wife and I went to the Sourdough Cafe at Arizona Charlies Boulder Hwy location. The service was so bad we walked out after waiting more than 30 minutes just for our water and coffee. Yesterday we took a chance and went back to Sourdough Cafe with my elderly father thinking this couldn't happen again... 
Silly me, turns out we had the same server, a middle aged caucasion woman blondish hair and she was the only server and no runners to help. She also had no sense of urgency whatsoever and her job was to do everything. We ordered coffee for the 3 of us andplace our order. 30 minutes later, coffee pot empty and no servers in sight my dad walked out, went downstairs and got a hot dog. My wife walked out and it took me almost 5 minutes to find someone to tell we were leaving AND I'LL BE DAMNED IF I WILL PAY FOR THE COFFEE. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"They have great specials! 

If you're looking for a cheap bite to eat then look no further, Sourdough Cafe has great prices and decent food. You can save a few cents if you obtain a players card. 

I always order the steak and eggs special which costs $4.49 with the players card, normal cost is $4.99, that's a whopping savings of $0.50 cents! Haha

Like I said, the food is decent, the steak isn't  thick, it's actually pretty thin but still delicious, seasoned right, juicy even when it's cooked well done. My eggs over medium are always cooked to perfection, hash browns are okay, they're a bit oily, the meal comes with your choice of toast (white, wheat, or sourdough) all buttered up. I strayed away from the steak and eggs once and ordered the pot roast, it was very dry so now I stick to what I know is good.

The cafe itself is clean, the service isn't the greatest. We were seated promptly and the bus person brought our waters out right away. The waitress took our orders quick as well but she brought out our food and we didn't see her again until she brought out our check. She checked on the table next to us various times but we were invisible to her, she asked the table next to us if they wanted to have dessert before she brought out their check. We weren't even asked that, what if I wanted some dessert? Lame. Maybe I should have spoken to her in Spanish since she was more attentive with her Spanish speaking customers. 

After your check is brought to you, you go up to the cash register to pay. The cashier was very friendly so kudos to her!"}
{"text":"Tl;Dr SourDon't Cafe. 
I remember my grandparents taking us here when we were younger. I knew they had a prime rib special, so we drove down here Saturday 1/2/16 for lunch.

Atmosphere- Very country-ish. They were playing country music, and country decor was scattered all over the walls in this place. 

Service- Our server, Pedro, served us, but that was about all he did. He was in a grumpy mood and it showed. We asked him what kind of soda they had, and he told us to ask the busboy, wtf. The bus boy ended up being a better server than he was! We wanted to leave a tip for him, but we couldn't find him so we asked the girls at the front if we could put the money in an envelope for him. We explained that he was much more helpful than Pedro, and they didn't seem surprised. Apparently they have this problem with him a lot. I don't understand why you would want your business to suffer because of one shitty server. 

Food- I ordered the men's cut (12oz) prime rib dinner. It came with salad, rolls, veggies and mashed potatoes. The prime rib was dry and nasty. It was very chewy too. The veggies that came with my meal were cold as well as the mashed potatoes. The rolls were warm though and the salad was decent. My boyfriend ordered the chicken fried steak with eggs, hashbrowns and biscuits and gravy.  We also ordered chili cheese fries to share. We asked that the fries come well done, and of course when they arrived at the table they were not. We told Pedro  so he went back to the kitchen. He then came back and told us the chef said that the fries aren't crispy because the chili and cheese on top make them soggy, wtf! We asked for them to just bring the chili and cheese on the side. (The cheese is the liquid nacho kind, my favorite.) 

Overall-  Shitty service that they are aware of, crappy food. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Located inside of Arizona Charlie's Casino.

$4.99 steak and eggs- you can't go wrong with this deal, it is a bargain. The eggs were good and so were the hash browns. The steak was fatty around the edges, so I just cut it off and then it was ok. 

Large restaurant, they can accommodate big parties. 

Be prepared to wait in line (maybe 20 mins or less when I went on a Saturday morning) if you aren't a premier member."}
{"text":"We went around 11 pm on a weekend. We were seated quickly, had our beverage orders taken (1 coffee, 1 beer) and were ID'd for the beer we ordered, then recieved only the coffee. Turns out the busser couldn't serve beer or something despite being of age. When our server made his way over, we had to reorder the beer and show ID again. 

After placing our orders, we quickly recieved the soup; a thick, processed-ham flavoured ordeal that had probably been simmering since early that day as it had thickened into a mud-like consistency. 

Then we waited. And waited. We watched several tables finish. Our waiter ran about doing his rounds until we had to flag him down to ask for another beer. After about twenty, thirty minutes our food arrived. We had ordered chicken 'tenders' (whatever that means) as an appetizer but they came out with the entrees. The boy had a steak while I had the cobb salad. His steak was flavorless and tasted like poor quality meat cooked without any love. He ate several bites and sent it back. The tenders were moist but on par with frozen grocery store offerings. The salad was the alone stand out as it was a MASSIVE bowl full of salad. I usually feel silly ordering a salad out when I can make one exactly to my likings for about the same amount of dough, but this thing was big enough to split between 3 people easily and be satisfied. 

Our server was a lot more expedient and attentive after the steak was sent back, and the hostess came by to inquire as to what was wrong. She seemed genuinely concerned that we enjoy our meal and told us how to avoid being re-carded for beer (go to the security cage, prove your age and get a wrist band) so the star is for her.

It's cheap food and if you're staying there it's a nice late night option if you're not in the mood for Sbarro. We'll probably be headed to Ellis island next time, though, as the environment is a bit nicer and the beer is cheap, generously served and the food is about the same if not a little better."}
{"text":"The service is hit or miss sometimes it's a good waiter/waitress others it's a bad experience from the beginning.. the service is aaaallwwaaayyysss slow and no sense of urgency.. It's great for cheap eats with players card and the foods not half bad but you most definitely feel like you are in the geriatrics ward of a nursing home and the sounds of social security benefits being squandered in the background in the slots always lift the ambiance. Only come here if you have time to kill or are cheap."}
{"text":"This place is so damn wonderful!!! I've been going here for the last 2 years  and Maung has been our waiter every single year and we always get damn good service.. Anyone who says otherwise  just grew up under the shaaaaaade tree all their life. So don't listen to them and try this place.  I am from CA and would actually drive from CA to here just to eat yahhhh!!!!!!!!!  :]  ps: I come for that  4.99 steak and egg deal!  So much food for such little price.. A huge steal!"}
{"text":"Oh Sourdough Cafe. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways... um nevermind I don't even know where I was going with that one.

The other day was the first time I tried the prime rib. It was a surprisingly a really good 12 oz. men's cut prime rib which came with a soup or salad and a side for like $14.  For some reason I thought it was just as good maybe even a little better than the prime rib I had from a steakhouse earlier and it wasn't because it was cheaper.  I don't know how to describe how a prime rib should be besides it looked and tasted good and blood wasn't running all over the place. I'd definitely order it again. Do yourself a favor, if you're craving prime rib get the men's cut, they had a prime rib and shrimp special for like $10 but the prime rib just wasn't the same. Ask my mom who got her prime rib and shrimp plate after a couple of men's cut prime rib plates were brought to the table. haha. 

Just like almost every Vegas casino cafe has a menu that highlights a cheap steak and eggs deal or various late night deals. Sourdough Cafe is no different. Here they offer a decent sized cheap steak, forgot how many ounces, a couple of eggs, and hash brown for under $5. I use to come here pretty often for steak and eggs back in the day back when it was cheaper, it's still pretty cheap.  It's not the best or cheapest in town but if you're craving it and you're in the area you might as well save some gas money.  

It's not a fancy place, it's kind of old, and a lot of the food is standard but I like it. 3.5 star.

Oh yeah they also have all you can eat spaghetti just incase you were wondering."}
{"text":"Another 5 stars!!! Seriously, other restaurants need to send their staff here to take notes on the service here!!!! Our server, Chris (4;30am) was AMAZING!!!!! Friendly, professional, and very sweet! Kudos to you, my new friend, you kick ass in the service industry!!!! The food? My Lord! Sooooo tasty! The prime rib? The Chef knows what he's doing....PLUS, offering it 24/7 and having it cooked to perfection??? This guy is my new hero!! Please give this crew a RAISE, they deserve it! Yes, it may be a little way from the strip...but trust me, you will love it!!!! Happy New Year to the Staff at Sourdough Cafe!! (Only basing this on dinner, have yet to try their breakfast)"}

Be sure to ask for butter on the side if you're careful about your heart."}
{"text":"I always come when in town, this time i came with my sisters who have never been  to vegas. WELL.. that was not what i wanted to show them. took forever for them to seat us (party of 4) we came in at 11am on a Wednesday. then they placed us in a section that seems to have no service! it took 25 min just to know who our server was. She completely ignored us and the table behind us, finally we got up and walked out but before i left i wanted to let the manager know... well he saw me, they called him twice and the host told him what was going on finally he called the cashier and told her to tell us he was to busy to \"deal with us\". wtf! i could still see you peeking to see if i left yet.

well to the manager who worked april 19th 2017 you are a very shitty manager, put your big boy panties on and deal with the customer's who have had shitty customer service from your employees. 

and to the \"server\" who ignored us and the table behind us... step up ur game, people dont pay to have shit service by someone who hates their job.. fake it til u make it or move on."}
{"text":"I don't live at home anymore so when my parents invited me to go to a place we used to go to all the time I was excited. This place used to be so delicious. 


I showed up 10 minutes later than everyone else. I got a 3 meal course. Onion rings were soggy and wasn't crispy at all. You'd be surprised with how much better it could be by leaving it in for another minute. Wasn't eatable. I got some burger (the only one for the 3 course option) and it tasted like frozen patties from Walmart. They asked how I wanted it and said \"medium\" but these were so thin it's impossible to do so mine was well done. Disgusting. Didn't even have the texture of real meat. The fries were just your normal fries. The steak used to be an actual steak but looking at my parents plates it didn't even look like real steak. Just some floppy meat. Soup was still good as usual (never disappoints as an appetizer) and it took the waiters a long time to realize that my drink was completely empty. I understand that I showed up later than they did but it took my food 20 minutes to come out and everyone was already done eating. Wtf? Done coming to such a cheap restaurant. Thanks for ruining traditions."}
{"text":"Sourdough cafe is always a tasty, low priced breakfast. The prices- I think I paid around $4 for steak and eggs with toast! Always ask for your eggs well done because they always bring them a little undercooked. Also, if you have your players card you get an extra 10% off!"}
{"text":"A Cowboy feeling type of place right inside Arizona Charlie's.
Those guys are open 24/7 and have a great 4.99 steak and eggs special, which is pretty damn good. 

The seating on their boots is kind of woody and stiff, but yet authentic. Between 11PM-7AM they have some great deals going on with breakfast deals ranging from 2.49-4.99 (the steak and eggs).

Don't expect the creme de la creme here service wise, it's just a quick bite in a casino with some great deals and a 24/7 convenience."}
{"text":"The glass is half full.  They removed my review because I reviewed it under Arizona Charlie's, the casino-hotel in which it is located.  On the flip side, they (Yelp HQ) notified me, thus I can do a cut and paste.

I've only been to the Sourdough Cafe once and, hot damn, I remember it.  My friend who lives in Las Vegas goes here fairly regularly and still gives me favorable reports.  I remember how good and plentiful the food was.

For the sake of brevity, I'll review Sourdough Cafe like this:
Great breakfasts + strawberry shortcake = 4 words
1 star + 1 star + 1 star + 1 star = 4 stars

Hi Robert,

We wanted to let you know that we've removed your review of Arizona Charlie's Decatur as it looks like it was meant for another business. It appears you meant to review Sourdough Cafe; the Yelp page for that business can be found at http://www.yelp.com/biz/sourdough-cafe-las-vegas-2.

Removed Content:
This is only for the RESTAURANT portion of the establishment....called the Sourdough Cafe.

Again, a \"local\" and a friend of hers found this place and took me there.

It's a little dumpy and not in a very inspiring area. What they lack in this department, they make up for in the food and VALUE. They had this incredible breakfast offer. It was an awesome breakfast that I had outside typical breakfast hours. We also split a strawberry shortcake. Unbelievable.

So much of Las Vegas's hinterlands are vapid, and transiting from my friend's place to Arizona Charlie's made me think, \"It better be good.\" It was.

{"text":"4 stars are mainly for their 3.99 steak n eggs. Service is decent and the rest of their menu is pretty interesting. I only come here for their steak n eggs deal cuz for that price, you cant really complain. You need a player card for this deal which is free to sign up for. Without it the regular price is only 50 cents more. But who doesnt like to save money? Once you get this deal, the rest of the menu is not as appealing cuz lets face it, anything more than 3.99 is really not a deal any more is it? Oh im sure the rest of their menu is probably ok just about everybody comes for this deal.

The one star they didnt get is because they are not 24 hours like the location off of Decatur and the 95. Also sometimes, you get a chef that doesnt know how to cook steak so when I say medium rare, I get it well done."}
{"text":"WOW! I USED TO THINK IT WAS OK COMING HERE.

But after my last visit, I don't think I will be coming back. 

(deep breath). Ok. Soooo........I bring my party of 9 on a wednesday night at about 9:45. We wait a couple minutes for them to set up our table. We sit down and look at our menus for a couple minutes. About 10 minutes later, still no acknowledgement. So I get up and ask the hostess up front if anybody knows we are there. 

Finally somebody shows up asks us what we want to drink. We gave our drink orders and said we were ready to order. To my disgust, she was only the \"drink\" person. She says she will go get our drinks and that our server will be out soon. A couple minutes later we get our drinks. Still no server.

15 minutes later still no server so at this point, we all decided to get up and leave. Its sad because I told a friend of mine that we were gonna be there with our party of 9 while he was getting his party of 10 together to show up later. After our experience, I texted him not to come any more because he would probably have to wait forever to get any kind of service.

I don't know what happened to this place. Service used to be decent. Looks like it went to crap that night. I wonder if they made some cut backs because when we went that night, it wasnt that busy. Looks like im gonna have to take my friends and family elsewhere for decent food and service."}
{"text":"Great place for a late night munchy run. I love the food and its not crouded at all. I would recommend this for any occation."}
{"text":"Yay and Nay.

Pros:
* If you are hungry and are low on funds, this is a good choice.
* Peach Ice Tea... Oh yeah!
* Alcohol available
* Even cheaper if you sign up for the Rewards Card

Cons:
*  Located inside AZ Charlies where the parking sucks
*  Everyone walks out smelling like smoke
*  Service here is bad bad bad!
* I ordered the Banana Creme Pie to go because they took so long to return to the table.  When I got home, I realized I was duped and given a Key Lime Pie instead.  How do you mess that up ?  How'd it taste?  Not a clue... I'm not a fan of Key Lime and left it in the fridge for a curious soul to discover.

Ordered: 
Rotisserie Chicken - A bit dry in the middle, but not too bad.
Mashed Potatoes -  How do you mess this up.. you can't & they didn't.
Green Beans -  Gotta have some veggies.  I wish I got broccoli though.
Banana Creme Pie - MIA
All this for under $10.00 w/ the rewards card!

Verdict:
  Okay, I was close extremely close to giving this place a 2 stars because the service was extremely slow ( and that's an understatement), but I after much contemplation, this is a place where you go when you want cheap eats.  I really shouldn't have expected to be treated like a king at this joint, but seriously lady, please refill my tea!  I'm choking on my chicken!!  When it came to paying the bill... I could have walked out and ran to meadows mall and back and my server would never have even known.  I'm giving this place a 3 star for the deal and the overall quality of the food.

Tips:
 *  sign up for the rewards card to really get the deal
 * DreadHeads wrap 'em up unless u want hair that smells like smoke.
 * ride your skateboard and you want have to F*ck with finding a parking"}
{"text":"Gave the place another try and I'm glad I did. The hamburger player's club special is delicious and a bargain at $4.99.

The burger is big. I couldn't quite finish it. The fries are good and crispy. The burger tastes more like home made than typical hotel coffee house hamburgers. It is dressed with the usual sliced tomato, onion and some dark green leaf lettuce. A bread and butter pickle wedge is served alongside the burger. 

Service is friendly and accomodating. 

Mikey C says: don't forget to bring your Ace Play card for player's club specials."}
{"text":"This place is open 24/7 and has hella cheap late night eats. 

I got steak and eggs and my boyfriend got a hamburger, fries, and mozzarella sticks. We both got drinks with our meals and we still spent less than $20 bucks w/ tip! Now THAT'S a deal. My steak was pretty chewy, but the portion was a lot bigger than a lot of other graveyard steak and egg specials I've had and at $3.99, how could I complain? The mozzarella sticks tasted just like Sonic's mozzarella sticks; nice and gooey on the inside and crisp on the outside, served with marinara sauce. My boyfriend's burger looked very fresh. The tomatoes, lettuce, and pickle just screamed, \"Eat me I'm f*cking crispy!\" and, of course, he devoured it all. 

*Tip
-You get 10% off your entire bill with a players card!
-They have daily specials for $9.49 that run from 11am-10pm:
Mon - Beef Stroganoff on Egg Noodles
Tues - Chicken Cordon Bleu.
Wed - Roast Pork with Mashed Potatoes
Thurs - Corned beef and cabbage w/ potatoes and carrots
Fri - Seafood platter
Sat - Yankee-Style Pot Roast with Mashed Potatoes
Sun - Roast Turkey Dinner"}
{"text":"If Delmonico's was the highlight of my trip, this was the lowlight.

I have some repressed memories stored up when I stepped in here, but I never quite remembered why. I did remembered staying at Arizona's Charlie a few times when I was much younger. 

Long ago when there was a convention called COMDEX, a computer geek convention that is much bigger than CES or Comic Con would be here in Vegas. The rooms would jumped up to ridicious high prices and yet we couldn't get any rooms on the strip or near the convention center. Arizona Charlie would be the one that bailed us out with cheap and yet reasonable prices.

I did remembered coming to Sourdough Cafe a few times, but I still can't remembered why I am having eerie feeling about this place.

When my buddy and I was wounding down our trip and getting ready to go home, I suggested this place only because I remembered there was a breakfast special that is less than $3. It's a good price and awesome way to end the trip.

Here's why my memories started to flood when the menu was presented...

In order to get the discount for the $2.99 special of Steaks and Eggs and that $2.79 special for the ham and eggs......... you will need to present a PLAYER'S CLUB CARD. That was a fine print you have to read in the menu to find that out. 

In essence, they wanted you to fill out some form like CVS Pharmacy or Ralph's and enroll in some honky dink program that their casino is having. Frankly, I could not understand on why they don't just offered it if it's PRINTED on the menu. Yes, there is an asterisk and a fine print in the menu, but it's just tacky and a little inconvenient just so you can go to some info booth and enroll into that Player's club, so in turn to get a discount at the breakfast joint.

Then I started to remember again... it was that my pals from many years ago would be searching the lobby, casino, and the hotel's hallways just so they can find a place to enroll in that program. When we couldn't find it, we had to stand again in the long line (Yes, this is a popular joint for the locals who love these specials, apparently I found out they enroll in another program to get the shorter line that is next to the line for the regular folks). 

So the long ordeal to find the place to enroll in that Player's club was not worth it in the first place, then to stand back in the long line for it was a big slap in the face. It hit me right in the gut when I remembered about that from a decade ago.

We're not talking about the menu printing up regular price and you would have to present a coupon to get the meal lower. No, we are talking about a blatant hook just to entice you to come here and then wham!...you can't get that special without a string attached. I know they make that fine print, but it's border lined on false advertising (not quite, but to me it was almost). By having different advertising around the web pages and having other web sites to promote that special grates me at times only because it's not that special.

Let's be frank, it's only about $4 more if you didn't join the Player's Club. Not a big whoop, but left a sour taste in my mouth when we left. I did wound up ordering the ham and eggs that was not bad, but not worth the full price. Even it was a discounted, I'm still hesitant to decide if I would come back for here regularly on my Vegas trips.

The service was OK and the waiter did his best to sympathize with us. I think he get that a lot from people who wondered why the price had a string attached. The meal was ordinary to say the least and I just can't see why this place was be popular for a 24 hour joint that never closes. The locals probably kept the place alive.

Just be aware that there will be a wait in the morning before 11am, a long wait in fact. Then realized in that the Steak and Eggs or the Ham and Eggs are not worth the hassle for the special. 

Order something else to avoid the frustration.

{"text":"The one star is for our waitress,  who was at least apologetic.  We'd  just left a high school competition  and wanted to grab a quick bite before continuing our day.  We ordered a steak and a salmon lunch.  45 minutes later and no food.  Every 10 minutes or so our waitress would stop by and give us yet another reason why our food was not done.  First it was that steaks take longer.  Ok.  Then it was that they were backed up.  Then it was a shift change - wait, I thought the steak was cooking?? I started to feel embarrassed for the waitress,  who keep coming out with food for other tables and had pass by our table each and everytime.  Once we saw that people who were seated after us were finishing thier meals, we left. This cafe isn't exactly destination eating anyway, but I wont be back.   Even if I'd gotten my food, I'd advise people not to bother.  Nothing I saw passing by my table to other patrons looked particularly appetizing.  I just wish I had that hour of my life back."}
{"text":"I usually get steak n eggs at south point late at night but we decided to try this place since their steak n eggs special is all day. For $5 you get a steak, hash browns, eggs, and toast. The steak was really thin so you're bound to finish it pretty fast. Everything was worth the price paid for but it could be a little better!

The service was pretty weird. I couldn't tell if  our server was being sarcastic or a total asshole."}
{"text":"i have been waiting almost an hour for a coffee refill and to order dessert. the employees seem more concered in talking to each other."}
{"text":"The food was okay, the waitress completely forgot my order, and they put a slice of processed cheese on top of the omelette. The sliced cheese on top of the Omelette was the worst part, I mean, come on, get some shredded cheese for crying out loud."}
{"text":"I've loved this place since the mid 2000's, I make a point to go here when I visit Las Vegas with family. Good thing Cracker Barrel opened because this place must have changed their management, it's changed for the worst. No more switching out biscuits and gravy without a charge too, management will make up the money they lost driving customers away by up selling breakfast."}
{"text":"Best place for a steak or Philly cheese steak sandwich. Best food for comfortable price."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the steak and eggs, $4.99 deal. If you have a player's card, you can get 10% off! And you can collect points from gambling, and receive discounts in the mail, like $5 towards dining credit, or $10 real cash! And you can also use the points you collect on your card towards your bill!  Steak and eggs comes with hash browns, and choice of toast. I like the rye bread...

Depending on the cook, I have had some steaks that are juicier and tastier than other times, but overall it's been very tasty and cheap.  (We did try the Arizona Charlie's on Boulder highway but we didn't think the steak was as good, way tougher!)"}
{"text":"The cafe always is a great place to grab a bite to eat.  The spaghetti and meatballs are wonderful and one of the best dishes here. Never go wrong with this.  The breakfasts are always good.  Service is great and the staff always attentive and friendly.  Also one of the few places left where you can still dine and play Keno, just like back in the \"old school days\" when many casino and resort restaurants did this.  Now a days, finding a dining spot where there Keno can be played is hard to find.  The menu has changed a bit, most of the favorites are still on there."}
{"text":"Congratulations people... I have located ( and ya know breakfast is my thing).  The absolute WORST breakfast spot.  SOur dough Cafe... Sour is a good starting point...not one dish that came out are up to standards.. do not by any means say crispy or hard to the waitress..you will get burnt and hard( swear to ya) multi dishes came out the same way...i had steak eggs hash browns wheat toast.... waste of time all of the above.   How do you get toast wrong you say..A) let it sit so that all the texture is gone.  Steak.  Lol.   Where did them cows come from. Eggs. Very colorful(not yellow). Hash browns taste as if the had been sitting on grill for an hour. We also had on the table. french toast. (Raw).   Pancakes.  Raw. Breakfast burrito. May have been the first item prepared.   Cold and now hard... i look at the patrons around and perhaps the kitchen caters to low income... senior citizens.. homeless... but all the above though short in income deserve a good hot meal as well when putting out their hatd earned cash....."}

If you sign up for a players card you get 10% off in every restaurant!

They have live keno right outside this restaurant and boards in the cafe to watch your games which I like a lot.

I am a sucker for the breakfast special and my man likes the pastrami. The chili tastes very good too but it isn't as hot as it describes on the menu.

Yes, this is a older casino and looks a bit run down but hey sometimes those are the best!

We like to come here every few weeks late at  night. Give it a try if you haven't you might just be surprised!"}
{"text":"day 15 - damn its already the third week??? where did the time go! do the la yelpers even notice i am gone??

all these questions but beyond that, where to eat comes first. i went to arizona charlie's and signed up for their players card. and then came to the sour dough cafe. please note they no longer have the player's card meal deals. but they do have 3.79 steak and eggs or ham and eggs combo still served 24 hours. it was worth just a lil more than the price so it was great. i was filled, but i had too much gravy ingestion with my biscuits and was sick for a lil bit. i've really been eating like crap this trip. 

tip - if you sit on the counter, you don't have to wait in line. and you don't have to sign up for the player's card to eat here. the food comes fast and it aint bad. it gets 4 stars just cuz of the cheapness. ive had food this cheap in vegas before and it was really worth 2 bucks. this actually is worth 6.99! so you are getting more than you pay for!"}
{"text":"I give this place one star! Went here for lunch with my chica Donna..we both ordered the Grilled cheese with fries. It took the server 15 minutes before they even took our order and bring drinks...and no they weren't busy. We waited 25 minutes for our order to come...and I say...Do not order the grilled cheese, unless you like burnt bread and no cheese. The menu reads it's gooey with cheese, what a joke. It was burnt and had one slice of cheese for the triple decker bread it came on. Not only did Donna and I have to ask the server to take it back(wish I would have taken a picture of the first order) and make it again..it took them 30 minutes to bring it, but when they brought us our second reordered grilled cheese, it was just as bad, I'll say they did add another two slices of cheese. Picture taken. We both just ended up eating our side of fries it came with and our iced teas. I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I was actually planning on going to the Yukon Grill because the reviews were so much better. But nobody came to seat me and the Sourdough Cafe special sounded pretty good and being from California I'd forgotten how hideously backwards other states are on allowing smoking so I just wanted to hurry up and get a bit to eat and get back outside. 

Service was unexpectedly wonderful! It was a bit late on a Sunday evening and the place was pretty quiet. Often a sign that it will be hard to find your waiter when you need them. Not this time. Wish I remembered my waiters name so I could include it here. He was so very attentive and friendly. The prime rib was excellent and done to perfection! So often hard to get it rare, especially late in the evening. 

I would definitely go back if I'm here in the area again."}

On a Wednesday night we are sitting at our booth and my daughter (5yrs old at the time) looks around and says \"Mommy is it Grandpa Day today?\" 
Me: \"Why?\" 
Daughter: \"Look at all the Grandpas, we should have brought our Grandpa\" 
Lmao, I couldn't stop laughing!!"}

{"text":"Always come here chicken noodle soup is so good yummmy!!!!! Service is good and place is 24 hours"}
{"text":"It's been a very long time since I've been here. We used to live right behind Arizona Charlie's and every weekend we would have breakfast here. I felt like remembering the old days so I decided to stop by. I came by myself and was seated almost immediately. A nice woman came and took my drink order. After that another waiter came and asked if I wanted anything. I told her that they are getting my drink already and in a snobby way she replied \"are you not going to eat? I'm here to get your food\". Came off very rude. I order Steak and Eggs, well done.

The food came out very quick, about 5 minutes or so. The Steak definitely wasn't well done. As I cut into it, it was very pink and chewy. Had to pour A1 sauce on it just to get a bit of flavor. Definitely wasn't what I remember. The service was horrible, didn't even get checked on the see if I needed anything. I don't know if it was just because I'm sitting by myself or what. The only time the waiter came back was to drop off the bill. Definitely not coming back, I'll just stick to South Point for my steak and eggs for now on."}
{"text":"I visit Arizona Charles at least once a month for the $3.99 hamburger special.  I've had the breakfast deals here as well, again for the price I believe it's worth it.  

The four star review is based on the quick friendly service and the 24/hr bargins.  In order to recieve the food deals, you need a players card.  Sign up its free. 

I like the sourdough cafe.  It's an old diner.  I would stick to breakfast, the hamburger and pastrami Sand which are all great deals. 

I suggest it as a go to spot if you want a quick, decent, cheap meal with friendly service. 

Also this last time I visited I was carded to get in, like others ive read happened to them before. I've been going to this cafe for 3 years now and have never been.id.  when I asked the manage at the front she was really rude about it.  Her response was \"this is a casino!\"? My response \"Umm... ok?! .. \" that did not explain why I was getting carded.  Even after asking the host why, it still made no sense. But whatever, I like the servers and the food. My tip goes to the servers not that manager. :-)"}
{"text":"Better than your usual dive casino cafe. Went to AZ Charlie's for the first time just to check out their prime rib and it did not disappoint. First of all: set your expectations right. AZ Charlie is a dive casino on Decatur. For $13, the 12oz prime rib was probably 85% as good as Lawry's. The sides were standard diner fare, so don't get your hopes up on that. Negatives: be prepared to smell like an ashtray coming out of this place."}

{"text":"I really wanted a Belgian waffle with strawberries & syrup but had I known that the fucking Belgian waffle that is suppose to be nice & crispy & amazing would be fucking drenched down in strawberry jam/juice + the strawberries I would have never asked for any fucking strawberries ! Who the fuck wants a soggy waffle ?! Is this shit a joke ?!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Steak breakfast for under 5 bucks in town workers are not always nice or on point but for the price you got to love it"}
{"text":"I don't think you can beat $3.99 steak and eggs unless you open a restaurant that serves $2.99 steak and eggs.  This cafe definitely draws in the locals since most waiters tend to know the customers by first name basis.  It's a bit of a trek from the strip so unless you rented a car, chances are you won't be in the area.  But if you do have a car, take a detour and come here for the deal.  Here's what it comes with:

* Eggs - scrambled, over easy, sunnyside up, etc.  I prefer over easy.
* Steak - Generous portion of steak.  Unsure what type of steak.  Maybe sirloin?  Medium-rare is my recommendation to you.
* Toast - wheat, white, muffin, biscuit & gravy.  I suggest you ask the butter to be on the side since it would be drenched otherwise.

Note that you need the rewards card so you and 3 other guests can have the meal at $3.99.  So if you have 5 people in your party, 2 of you need to get the rewards card.  It's free by the way."}

{"text":"I ate here with a few of my friends one evening at the  Sourdough Café here at Arizona Charlies  on boulder highway. 
We all ordered the Hamburger Special that looked good on the picture but when we got our food order at the table the hamburger looked like it was for a small child as well as the french fries that were cold and greasy, I sent back the fries and the waitress gave me a batch that were basically the same( cold and greasy), oh well we ate up and got our bill and noticed there was a extra charge for cheese on the hamburgers, I asked the waitress whos name I cant remember except she was stocky short with blond hair tied back and glasses, what the charge was for, and she said that I wanted cheese on the burger but never told us that it would cost extra, she insisted she told us all this in the beginning and scolded us for not paying attention, I have no problem paying for something extra but me and my friends do not need to be scolded and humuliated in public as other custmors were watching from there tables. when this was going on the manger walked by and looked over and did absolutly nothing to help, maybe he was to  pretending to look busy.

By the time we got done paying for this crummy meal, I lost my desire to stay at the casino and play some cards with my friends.

Over the years this was a pretty good place to catch a bite at a good price but more recently it seems this place has slipped in food quality and giving small portions as well as higher prices on there food. Needless to say this restaurant is poorly managed and probaly will close up in the near future from lack of custmors."}
{"text":"Located in Arizona Charlie's Decatur, Ok some of the best deals in Las Vegas, 4.49 for steak and eggs with a biscuit the size of a hat box covered in gravy, 2.50 mango margaritas! plus a collection of graveyard specials that will have you doing a double take! If you find yourself on the west side stop in for great cheap food. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"another local favorite. you will find this place packed most of the time. cheaps prices and huge portions. they used to have $0.77 breakfasts but that has changed to about $3 per breakfast including steak & eggs, a full ham steak & eggs and more. the food is a little above average. the service is friendly but a little slow. alot better than the buffet or food court here at arizona charlie's probably why it's always busy. all you can eat ribs,spaghetti and more. check their site for more."}

As noted always a Best of Vegas breakfast contender. Not really that good but consistent and CHEAP. $2.99 Pancakes & Eggs, $3.99 Steak & Eggs, $2.99 Strawberry Shortcakes!

BEST spot to eat after drinking, YES! Fast,Cheap & Filling.

I had the Chicken Fried Steak with scrambled eggs,hashbrowns and wheat toast.

The wife had the NY steak and scrambled eggs with hashbrowns and a biscuit w/gravy(instead of toast)

Mine was real iffy, too fried-gravy was too thick & lumpy, hasbrowns were good,eggs were a little runny, toast was soaked in butter.

Steak is a little fatty-NOT real New York Strip steak, biscuit was tasty & flaky but again gravy was too thick.

The service was a little slow only got 1 refill the entire time & it wasn't very busy at all at midnight.

Overall it was $20 for 2 people and we left full. It was cheap,fast and OPEN!"}
{"text":"If you're on a budget and HUNGRY you can get big portions of food for less than $5 here, it's better than going to Denny's.

I came here for the $4.49 Steak and Eggs, which is available 24/7 unlike South Point and you don't have to be 21 and over to get the deal BUT you'll need the ACE PLAY card to get hooked up.

The Steak and Eggs were HELLA BOMB or was it because I was fucked up? Hmmm.  The steak was noticeably bigger than the one in the Coronado Cafe in South Point.

Arizona Charlie's on Decatur is closer to my apartment and my cheap hungry ass would sometimes wait till midnight to head over to South Point, which is like a 30 minute drive away. Even when times can get tough, I'd rather eat here than live off ramen noodles. I will be frequenting this place from now on and they also have $2 domestic draft beer and you don't have to wait for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Where do I start. Me and my other half decided to try their $3.99 all you can eat pancakes special & $4.99 Burger's & fries. The problem is they charge $3.99 for a small glass of orange juice that tasted like medicine. They called this a large! So the OJ was just as much as the special. My ice tea was $2.99. seriously! This is how they make up for their \"Specials\" The drinks are a ripoff. As far as the pancakes they were tasteless. The burger was a very thin frozen Patty. Just a warning. Don't get hooked in by those specials. They aren't special at all. At least the waiter & cashier were nice."}
{"text":"Steak & eggs used to be $3.99.  PTs bought out Az Charlie's so the new price is $7.77!!  Bowl of soup was $2.79 several months ago...same bowl of soup tonight was $4.99.   Not worth the price."}
{"text":"This was the absolute WORST meal we have eaten in YEARS... We are seated and the waitress saunters over with jer hands in her pockets, obviously NOT pleased to be there. We order an iced tea, a milk, an apple juice and a water. She brings them and the apple juice tastes like water an apple was washed in. I ask her if she can replace it and I am met with an attitude but she goes and replaces it. 4 of us for dinner. 2 prime rib dinners with baked potatoes, a spaghetti & meatballs & T-bone steak steak with fries. 3 of us ordered salad, one soup. She brings 2 salads and the soup, leaving my husband without his salad. She does not return for over 15 minutes, I ask her,\" does his not come with salad?\" She chuckles and says,\" Oh my God...I am so forgetful...I'm sorry, buddy...\" his salad arrives, dinner comes 10-15 minutes later"}
{"text":"Great for steak and eggs at 3 am!!  Extremely cheap with a players card! One of my favorite late night spots. The lemons were cut prefect. But the chicken fingers were kinda gross.. but the lemons make this place a 4 star place"}
{"text":"The worse service, they took 15 minutes just to bring us drinks. The workers are rude and the food is gross. Better off going to Denny's food is better and cheaper."}
{"text":"$4.99 Farmers Breakfast, $5.55 for steak w/eggs and ham w/eggs.  I had steak n eggs (medium rare)with hash browns/toast it was pretty ok had to keep adding hot sauce to steak for flavor and filling. I added onions and mushrooms for a small charge.     No complaints from Roxy she had the farmers breakfast, she asked for crispy bacon and was exactly qhat she asked for.  10% off with players card."}
{"text":"I've only had breakfast at AZ Charlie's Sourdough Cafe but every time I come to Vegas I make a point to come for breakfast.  The $3.49 Farmer Special is a bargain and the Steak and Eggs too.  Food is hot, fresh and tasty.  Service is good, waitstaff is has this system down.  I love that you get a carafe of coffee, so refills are easy.

Yes, the place could use a remodel, but I really don't mind eating in a dated restaurant if the food is good and the price is this low.

Be sure to get your ACE play card in order to qualify for the deals."}
{"text":"This is the 24 hour cafe in Arizona Charlie's Decatur.  They offer really good food specials for cheap (nightly special steak and eggs for $3.99 with your card) among others.  The food is pretty good for the price, and the restaurant has always been clean.  The service staff is friendly, attentive, and fast.  The restaurant itself has won the \"Best of Vegas\" award for their breakfasts the last few years running.  Definitely deserving of return visits!!!"}
{"text":"We started at the Boulder Highway Sourdough Cafe and when we changed sides of town, so did the most affordable breakfast.  We have been three times since we have moved.  I must say, out of the 3 times, twice we had to send our food back... BUT The issues were resolved quickly and with a smile.  Honestly, with the price ($2.99 for sausage, eggs, hashbrowns, and toast or $3.99 with ham) can we fairly complain the hashbrowns were not cooked perfectly the first time through?  The servers at this AZC's all are friendly, and the drink staff keeps your beverage full.   They have several dinner specials, too, but we have not tried them at this location yet.  We will continue to go there once to twice a week.  Can't beat the price, the taste, and the smiles!"}
{"text":"Cafeteria food was obviously just what I needed because this hit the spot (plus I was too lazy to take the car and drive somewhere else after driving the length of Nevada--could they make the roads any straighter? Plus, our Saab loves the speed limits or lack thereof).

Anyway, check out their before 5 p.m. dinner menu. I ate the Chicken Marsala. It came with some veggies and white sticky rice. I had a moment of thinking I needed some soy sauce for the rice (it wasn't on the table; isn't soy sauce mandatory in a diner like this?)--but then I realize the secret to this meal is the \"gravy\" I mean, sauce. Mix it around with the sticky rice and Just Eat It! 

4 star yummy filled my tummy."}
{"text":"Steak and eggs for 3.99, u can't beat that in the morning. Especially starting out on a trip back to L.A.   We enjoyed our meals here.  In order to get 3.99 steak & eggs you have to get a players card at the desk.  It's free.  We will definetly be back."}
{"text":"Sorry Charlie :(
Update: The new menu is a total rip. So many options have been removed including their well know steak and eggs for under $5 bucks! My sis and I ordered two omelettes with tomato, cheese, jalapeño, spinach and two chocolates for $35. Absurd pricing at this local neighborhood casino. 

Late Night Snack


Arizona Charlies West is still holding its own as an off strip local casino with decent \"wallet friendly\" eats. Stopped in this evening to grab a well deserved snack (also known as a meal) and to sober my conveniently wasted gal pal! 

The service has always been mediocre to be truthful but servers manage to get the job done. 

The place is clean and not quite an ash tray like you would assume by the casino area. 

My dinner Caesar salad was satisfying (drenched in dressing though) $7.99
I ordered hash browns and toast as well which was also saturated in butter. 

My gal pal had a shrimp dinner and ate plenty with no complaints. The shrimp looked nice and golden brown. $13.99

If your in the mood for cheap decent food this place is definitely recommended!

Of course I'll be back!

$30 bucks total"}
{"text":"Just consumed the nice prime rib dinner with delicious mashed potatoes and brown gravy tha must have had crack cocain or something illegal in it because it was SO tasty ....au jus was great...dunk your dinner roll with butter into mashed potato gravy and then into au jus juice....wow! String beans were fine...so was salad...ordered steak medium rare...came out a perfect juicey medium..nice! Rolls were nice...service was good... I really think for the money this is the best prime rib deal in town...not a fancy place but quiet and clean and good service...I will be back...hahaha , ....actually tomorrow to split the big Reuben sandwich and fries with a friend for lunch...o yeah ..on Friday they have a really nice clam chowder soup with lots of clams...good stuff ...when asked for soup or salad and you are offered clam chowder or salad, get the clam chowder...Nice!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend sticking with the breakfast options here (very large portions and delicious).   Fantastic local spot and prices to match (the Bloody Mary's are always great here).    Service is very attentive and speedy. 


 Diner is in need of refurbishing as booth seats are well worn out and can be uncomfortable.

  If you're craving traditional breakfast and are in the area then swing on in."}
{"text":"Cheap breakfasts but they get you with the beverages!  Steak was dry and scary looking. Eggs and hash browns were good!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family a few weeks ago. Although I thought it was strange for a restaurant to be so abandoned during lunch, I kept an open mind and was ready to eat. I had the New York Steak with a side of vegetables and a salad. I asked for my steak to be Medium, which is typically suppose to be \"A more pronounced band of pink in the middle of the steak. However, there should still be slightly more gray-brown than pink coloration.\" Unfortunately, it was way more than medium well. It was so dry and inedible that no amount of steak sauce could save it. My vegetables were unnaturally bloated and tasted like rubber. Also, the \"grill marks\" looked like they were drawn on with a sharpie. The only thing that was good was the salad I had with no dressing or add-ons (croutons, etc.). My mother who had Italian dressing on her salad said it was incredibly salty. She ordered the Porterhouse Steak and had the same result as me. The staff was respectful, but due to the poor quality I experienced I will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best deals for steak & eggs that I've seen in Vegas. Ellis Island used to hold that distinction until they raised their prices by a dollar but I never really liked Ellis  anyway on account of their charred brick of steak they gave you.

This place, while way off the strip, has even better steak and eggs than Ellis and is cheaper. And the piece they give you isn't 50% fat! Not only that, instead of those dull string beans and potatoes Ellis gives you, you get hasbrowns. Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"This place gets 3 stars because its cheap, the food is decent, and the waitresses are so nice. You basically get what you pay for, nothing fancy here. Family loves the wings! I am tried a few things on the menu, the Sombrero skillet for breakfast was good. A quesadilla appetizer, the chicken tenders, and the sandwiches are good. Some of the people i went with did not like their food but really you cant expect to have a good spaghetti with meatballs at a place this cheap, like i said, you get what you pay for. It is just okay if you dont wish to spend a lot and just want something quick and easy, the best part is the ladies that serve you. So nice!"}
{"text":"The waitress we had was absolutely terrible. Not only did she neglect to bring us our toast but when she did (after we had already finished our meal) she had yelled at us for being impatient. This place used to be an institution but now it's absolutely awful. The food came out cold and tasteless. Sorry never coming back here and you shouldn't either."}
{"text":"4am hungry and tired. Casino 3.99 breakfast. 

This is a decent ace to eat. Clean and service is great the few times I've been in.  One night (Monday's maybe) they have pot pie that's good. 


Get your players card for the decent pricing. 

Eggs over medium came out Perfect! Thanks!

Sourdough toast delicious and crisp. 
Ham steak delicious
Hash browns crispy goodness. 

Can't go wrong with those breakfast specials and definitely enough food to fill ya up. 

Water comes with lemon"}
{"text":"Been coming here off and on for years. The food is good, but expensive for a hotel/casino coffee shop. The portions are large, but would much rather have smaller portions at a lower price. Lots of food wasted that we didn't want to take home as it couldn't be reheated. Service is horrible. And it wasn't that busy at 5p.  After being seated for more than 15 minutes finally someone took our beverage order. It took another 5 minutes for the server to take our order. Could find the server for refills. Won't return here for a while."}
{"text":"My opinion is skewed by my love of the Sourdough Cafe at the ACD on Decatur.  Compared to the other Sourdough Cafe, this place seemed rather sterile with no counter seating option, no character or characters.  The service was minimal and the food edible.  You get what you pay for.  Makes me miss living closer to the other Arizona Charlies (on Decatur).  The Casino is a lot nicer, but this Sourdough Cafe just can't compare to the other."}
{"text":"$3.99 steggs? Who can complain about that. I usually go to South Point, but I was on the east side of Vegas so I figured I'd give them a try. I went with a friend around 12:45 am & we were seated promptly. Tony our waiter was such a sweetheart! Super friendly & checked on us periodically. The food is decent for the price. You pay for what you get basically. The only downside is we were rushed to pay because the manager had to drop her bank for the night or else we would've had to wait until 2:30am. Which I completely understand, but it was kind of an inconvenience. I'll probably be back if I'm on this side of town again & want to eat for cheap :) oh & their $2.50 margaritas are good too."}
{"text":"If you are in a casino then you will get solid American food at a reasonable price. If you join their frequent flyer club (if you put money in slots or  gamble at the tables, you must join their club) you will get discounts on the meal here.

This is a typical casino eatery. It is right next to the stuff-yourself buffet where you can eat your fill to overflowing. Here, at the Sourdough Cafe, you will leave with money in your pocket and without spending an arm and a leg.

I had the hamburger and fries for 4.99 less 10% for the club card. Draft beer is only $2.00.

The hamburger was cooked to order and was just right. You can add cheese or fried onions for a little added extra cost.

Across the casino (you are upstairs by the way) is a bar with a number of TV screens that will entertain you while you eat if you are alone. Between you and the TVs is a floor of hopeful gamblers pushing buttons and waiting for the reels to match up and the bells to ring. Jackpot!

Enjoy your meal here but don't expect gourmet food. You do however get your money's worth."}
{"text":"I come here about once a week and have their breakfast farmhouse special $3.99 (2 eggs, links / bacon, toast or biscuits and gravy; a dollar more for steak or ham). I am always happy with the food and service there. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Over the past few years I have had many meals here at Sourdough Cafe.  Some hits and some misses.  But, that is the human factor of eating out.  You never know if you are there on an off day for the restaurant or if they are on the ball.  But, the quality of Sourdough remains the same.  The food is pretty good.  Everything from the players card specials to the desserts.  Nothing mind blowing but you leave satisfied.  With all of that said, here is my review from my last visit.

For best access to Sourdough Cafe, park on the top floor of the parking lot.  It is on the right hand side as you walk through the doors.  

We stood in line to wait to be seated.  It wasn't that busy but it seems like you always have to wait for a couple of minutes before they seat you.  No big deal...

We were led to our table and given our menus.  But, there was no need as we only had one thing on our minds... The huge Banana Splits.  Yum - a - dum - dum!  

It took a few minutes for our drink order to be taken and a couple of minutes more for the server to get to us.  Again, no big deal.  It's a good time to catch up and hangout with friends.  So we order our boat of ice cream.  Vanilla, Strawberry, Chocolate ice cream, banana, various sauces, mountain of whipped cream, sprinkle of nuts and a cherry.  In the past I have made the mistake of ordering one just for myself only to claim defeat.  Not this time.  There were four of us and we bought two to split.  We were gluttonous and before we hit sweet overload; we ordered some fries to counter it.  Smart thinking!!!

And, so the night ends with the check.  I don't remember how much it was exactly but I believe the Banana Splits were only $6 a pop.  What a great deal.  

*on a side note: we found out that the server has to make the banana splits themselves.  And we were told that if we wanted / needed more nuts or whipped cream to let them know.

We made sure to tip well after we heard that... So good job!!!

*another side note:  I would have taken pictures but I was given a ration of crap from my friends for trying to do so earlier.  And, being insecure because of it, I didn't take any.  I'll man up next time."}
{"text":"Been to this location about 3-4 times. This last time I went I got good customer service. Even though it's Wednesday it was pretty busy but the line was moving quick. 

Didn't get our waitress name but she was kind didn't rush us. The only thing I don't like about coming to places like this is the smell of smoke. Other than that the prices are great, decent customer service, and fairly quick."}
{"text":"Just moved to this part of own,  was looking for a local spot with a good affordable breakfast.....WE HAVE A WINNER"}
{"text":"I say I've eaten here well over a dozen times, usually for breakfast or a late dinner.

I have to say their breakfast specials are hard to beat for the price.  I've had every single one of them at least once.  I mean $2.99 for The Skillet Breakfast with two eggs, hash browns and choice of bacon or sausage and toast or biscuit and gravy.  Come on!  Of course, you have to order a drink which costs more than the breakfast, I think an orange juice cost me about $3.50, but it's still a great deal.  Steak and eggs is only $3.99.  Be sure to get your ACE Players card for free for 10% off.

If you order the biscuits and gravy the biscuits are literally swimming in gravy.

Service is generally fine.  Was served by a jolly waitress at the counter who really enjoyed her job and deserved to be cast in a network sit-com as a waitress for a 6 digit salary.  On the other hand, one time I worked a full day in Los Angeles, drove 6 hours to Vegas dead tired, and got treated like a moron by another waitress when I asked her to repeat the specials because I was so groggy.

I had the chicken pot pie which was good, and the corn beef and cabbage which was really good, but served only on Thursdays.

I've never left the Sourdough Cafe hungry, and I always felt I got my money's worth.  It ain't fancy, but if it were transported to a location near my home or work, I'd eat there."}
{"text":"I visited this location with my wife on 3/11/2013. I remember coming to this establishment as a child. I remember when coming here that the steak and eggs where 1.99. Well times have definitely changed the steak and eggs is now 3.99. It's still not a bad price. I ordered the steak and eggs and my wife ordered the chicken fried steak with 2 over hard eggs which also came with biscuits and gravy. The customer service was not great the lady checked on us a few times but never really went out of her way to ensure that we were having an overall good experience. My biggest issue was when I saw the bill we paid for a large OJ and the cup for the large OJ was extremely small I'd hate to see what the small OJ is like. It would probably be a small shot of OJ. I do plan on visiting this establishment again stictly because of the price."}
{"text":"This place is located upstairs at Arizona Charlies.
A lot of locals come here for the cheap specials.
They have some good ones different nights.And if you have a players card you can also get mailings with specials.

Sometimes there is a line to get in I have to say because it seems service is never too great! But the line can go pretty fast depending on how fast the tables get cleared or if someone is near the area to seat you.
Be prepared most of the time to sit  and wait a bit before the waiter comes to your table,
I have never figured out why it is so bad here. Once in a great while you may hit it lucky,

Its good for breakfast as well as most of the food we have tried is not bad here at all. If it wasn't so cheap I am sure no one would go here because it is always the same way with service.
Otherwise we suggest if your hungry and your at the casino why not eat here."}
{"text":"Hidden inside an older casino outside of the strip, but that makes it better right? No traffic and less of a wait. Pretty simple, quick and delicious for the price. Can't go wrong with steak and eggs for $5.55. It comes with hashbrowns, 2 eggs, and steak."}
{"text":"This is the locals casino and it is always crammed with locals... and so are the food venues. Sourdough is a place where you can always eat good food at sweet deal prices. Great menu selections, specials for card members and quick seating at the counter. There are of course some trade-offs. 
1. The staff do as best as they can. The place is always doing business and they don't staff enough people and they are too tired to \"hustle\" and get that food and drink out there. They are good people but they don't drive Mercedes home with a mountain of tips. If you want that speed and quality you can pay for it next door at Ron's. It's \"Diner\" service with a good step above Diner quality food. Give'm a rest because they deal with...
2. Long term regular customers. Social Security could open a monthly check window at the Cashier here. You get people arguing how the breakfast went up to $3 as if they haven't paid for gas in 10 years. Many are cranky, know the workers and talk like they are co-workers. People come there to watch sports on the bigscreens, play keno at the table, take the FatFamily out or crash in between Bingo sessions.
It's something to contend with, but if you like Strawberry Shortcake the size on an entree? You make do."}
{"text":"Typical casino cafe, with great drink prices and very reasonable food prices. $8 for a bottle of wine or $1 for screwdriver, mimosa & Bloody Mary. 
Tried the signature sandwich Reuben, it was good and a decent portion. The potato salad was the standout, however. It was \"loaded\" potato salad, with bacon & green onions. Very tasty, could've eaten a ton of it. They should do more with it, like a special dish that features it.
Will try to return with some friends for more potato salad!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good, last week came for breakfast and the food was bad. My friend got sick! The chicken fingers were tough, sour cream tasted bad. They were short handed food took forever. I don't know what happened here"}
{"text":"I was very simple, I needed dinner and they came through. I had a club sandwich that was as good as any. The people were helpful and the service was about the average for casino, wait patiently as there are so many things going on. The staff seems to be hustling around a lot, so I guess a bit more staff could be in order.
Oh well - Be patient and all things will come."}
