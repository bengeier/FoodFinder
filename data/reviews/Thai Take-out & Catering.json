{"text":"TAMIL food take-outs... The quality of food and service has gone down dramatically 

I guess the cook or management has changed... arrogant people at the counter now a days"}
{"text":"DON'T judge a book by it's cover!  I came here prior to June 30th and saw they had a sign saying they won't open until after June 30th, I believe it is for redecorating.  I was thinking WHY a Thai place would open up around this neighbourhood and why it is only for take-out and catering?

It opened and looked at the FOREIGN lettering, could that be Thai or Indian language because they are both very interesting.  I walked in and FOUND my answer, it is a smaller version of Babu and it is Sri-Lankan South Indian Cuisine.

If I ever open a restaurant, I'll name it DOG Food Resto but serve Designer Cat Food.  Serves me right for pre-judging restaurants by name.

I was greeted by a friendly young man behind the counter but what caught my attention was the DESSERT counter.  It was displayed so beautifully and so many to select from.

There are no menu boards anywhere so if you aren't familiar, you'll have to ask them for their take-out menu.  I saw Tandoori 1/2 Leg for $1.00 and saw it on the hot tray.  

It doesn't have as much items on the menu as Babu but still enough for local Indians to come in one after another but once again no line designation so use the Meat Counter ordering method and get the staff's attention anyway you can.  I did cause I was the only Chinese there for around 15 minutes I was there.

Got the Mutton Curry medium size for $4.00 and 3 Samosas for $1.00 which was the Samosa fillings I like which had Onion/Peas/Corn bits in a Potato mix but I didn't notice as much spice aside from bits of Red Chili Pepper.  Mutton was cut up into small cubes so it was just a bit chewy but the Curry was alright."}
{"text":"This place is great to pick up some lunch, they have a variety of foods. When your just not sure what you want for lunch you can go here and find something that will look good."}
{"text":"Breakfast foods like vada dosa idly are fine ..but they store the chutney for few days in the fridge so I avoided chutney and get just Sambar...never ever get non veg items from this place ..the quality of non veg items are horrible .."}
