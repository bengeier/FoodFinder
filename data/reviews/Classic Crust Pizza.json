{"text":"Let me first say, we are Phoenix people, not Chicago or New York, and thus we have limited 'expertise' about pizza....but we know what we like.  We called in our order for pickup, and were there ahead of its readiness...but it was still cold, as one other reviewer said.  Probably our lack of knowledge, but when we specifically ordered thin crust we thought that it would be at least somewhat crispy.  Instead, it was more what I would call a 'medium' crust and very soggy and doughy.  This was a Saturday noon, and they didn't seem over-busy, nor did they offer any apologies, so I assume it was 'as it is supposed to be'?  We ordered chicken/black olive/green pepper...and the quite scanty ingredients were sprinkled around the medium as if they had run out of everything as they were doing our pizza...also minimal cheese and sauce.  I know, only 17.95 for a medium, but I'd rather they charged a bit more and made it a 'meal'.  We were looking for a neighborhood regular pizza place, but now we will be looking on down the street."}
{"text":"So far I have tried the hot Italian and the pizza and most of the fried delights and really liked the food. I don't know why I didn't want to like this place, but I ended up trying the food and was pretty blown away.  I can see how some people might think the staff is a bit ... casual? I don't know, just not much professionalism, but its' a \"cities style\" pizza place with great food so get over it, order it,  and eat it already.   The place is very clean and the bar looks to seat about 6 with a decent sized dining room. It feels fast foody inside kinda, but the food brings it up a notch.  Try the stupid good fried garlic knots and dessert knots and then double or triple the order you just made, they are amazing when made right. I only say that because the first two times I had them they were crispy puffy delights of pillowy goodness and once when I ordered delivery they were soggy but delicious wads of garlic dough. I still ate them in record time mind you, but totally different. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We purchased a Groupon for $18 which included a large three topping pizza or specialty pizza, side of pasta and an order of Zeppoli. First off, the Groupon is a steal! We absolutely loved the pizza, Fettuccine Alfredo and Zeppoli! The deal was enough to feed four hungry adults. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So disappointed! I ordered a pizza and garlic knots and it is so bad my wife and I couldn't eat it and had to order from a different restaurant. The garlic knots were burned to a crisp and the pizza haf practically no toppings while the middle of the pizza was almost raw and stuck to the box. We honestly had to rip out little pieces to get it out. We will never order from this place again. When calling in to let them know what was going on they hung up on me, but not before yelling at each other while I could hear everything they said. Then the person I spoke to when I called back said they couldn't do anything for me and said I would have to wait until an owner came in and that she would have them call me. Just bad business... Not sure why they have 5 stars??? Looks like more friends and family ratings."}
{"text":"Overpriced pizza $18 for a cheese pie? Was ok but not worth going back for. Priced to high"}
{"text":"Had the Sunday special. Wings, pizza and lasagna were great!  Definitely come out and check out this local restaurant with local beers on tap."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and wings!!!!  Excellent customer service.  Classic Crust is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not worth what I paid and not impressed.  That they delivered pigeon wings instead of chicken wings.  Pizza crust was soggy."}
{"text":"Customer service is bad food is bad  I talked to a person on the phone  She said she was managing  I told her I made a order for delivery  And the food was bad  She said she will take care of it  She lied bad food and customer service I wish I can leave no stars but can't do your self a favor save your money go some where else"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the owners are super nice people. They have happy hour pricing on their beverages all day and a great selection of local craft beer. Seriously, the deals on the beer can't be beat! You buy one at full price and your refills are half off. They have big blue van and a lot of San Tan and other local breweries on tap which is fabulous! We stopped by here as we live nearby and try to always support local business over chains. The restaurant is super clean and again, staff is super nice. The pizzas looked amazing but they were the blandest pizzas we've ever had. Absolutely no flavor to the cheese, to the sauce, to the meats nothing. It was the weirdest thing! The ingredients looked fresh but they just had no taste. We have considered going back in to take advantage of the beer deals and to order some appetizers to see how those are but we will never order pizza from here again."}
{"text":"I am updating/revising my review for Classic Crust.  We had an unfavorable experience and the owner, Alex, went out of his way to make it right.    The product that we received tonight was delicious and what we expected in the first place.  Kudos to the establishment to take ownership of a bad evening and go out of their way to correct it.  As a small business owner I understand that mistakes happen and growing pains are, painful.  When business owners go out of their way to correct it, it is important to make sure that the public knows they care.   Our food tonight was hot, fresh, and delicious.  We will definitely order agian and I hope that they can consistently deliver this product."}
{"text":"Ok, Alex here it goes.....let's see if it stays up!  Had the beefy Italian grinder. DELICIOUS! Didn't expect the fries, but they were outstanding as well, the au jus was a perfect dipping sauce for the fries.  Best Philly style cheese steak I've found in Phoenix to date.  (21 years)  Thanks for the zepolli!  That was awesome!   Your new best customer!"}
{"text":"Great friendly family owned pizza place...needs to be on Diners Drive-in and Dives.  This husband and wife team do an amazing job.  Food is delicious and easy on your pocket book.  They offer local beers...Huss Brewing's Scottsdale Blond goes great with any pizza on the menu. A hidden gem just off the 51 and Cactus...try it...you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Back again for the second time. Can't wait to eat the awsome pizza then have Dessert!  The Zeppoli's are little balls of pure yummyness. Once you start you can't stop!"}
{"text":"The place is clean and staff was warm and welcoming. The wings were really good.  The Gluten Free pizza was also good and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Best pizza to ever hit my mouth. Seriously this is the best pizza in all of Phoenix. You have to try the spicy meatball, it is literally to die for."}
{"text":"went to this new spot in my neighborhood because NY Nabor kid said it was the bomb,had a five topping pie,yes five toppings,and a Italian sub.Man was I blown out of the water when I took the pie,is pizza home and bit into it,first I noticed the sauce,AMAZING, then analized the quality of the topping,non greasy,VERRY flavor rich,quality,Dammmmm,went back the next day,And don't get me started on the NOTS DESERT,OMG.GOD HAS ANSWERED MY PRAYERS,NEW YORK STYLE PIE,IE PIZZAS WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE TO MY HOME.YAY,AND IM TOO BIG TO LIE,HAVE I DIED AND GONE TO NEW YORK OIE HEAVEN,LOL"}
{"text":"Good stuff. We stayed at a local resort , called in a delivery they were pretty quick pizza came nice and hot. Ordered a large pepperoni, jalapeño, mushroom,black olives so good. Also 10 piece wings very good not the soggy skin stuff. And the garlic knots holy moly there's a lot. . Thanks 5 stars for us"}
{"text":"The crust is good and the toppings are always fresh. If you like plenty of cheese, then be sure to order extra cheese otherwise it may be light."}
{"text":"If your looking for the BEST dessert in town, then you need to come here and order the Zeppolis!  They are to die for....kinda taste like a funnel cake, but look like little donut holes lightly dusted in powdered sugar.  I'm generally not into desserts because they are normally so heavy and filling, but the Zeppolis are surprisingly \"light\" (even though they are fried).  On top of having this amazing little desserts, they also have amazing customer service!!! Everyone in there was so polite and everyone had a smile on their face.  Nothing like going into a restaurant and knowing that everyone working there is happy to be there and happy to help their customers!  Their service was very fast too!  A + Classic Crust!  Best pizza place in town for sure! Don't believe me? TRY IT!!!"}
{"text":"Always great service the delivery is quick from the oven. We have been/ordered here 12 times in the past three months. It's become \"the\" pizza place for me.  Best stuff:  Spicy meatball pizza zepoli  garlic knots"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We live nearby and decided to check out Classic Crust when we received a coupon from them in the mail.  It was great and we have been back multiple times since then. The people are friendly, food is delicious, drinks are cold and laid back setting with good music is what keeps us coming back.    The atmosphere is nothing fancy, just an open area with a small bar to the side (about 5 stools) where you can either dine in or sit and have a beverage while waiting for your to-go order.  They have good beers on tap (a few locals), the glasses are frosty and cold and the best part is happy hour runs all day EVERYDAY!! This includes half off pints after your first one. I believe wine and champagne are also on the list.    The pizza is cooked just right with a slight crunch to the crust and topped with perfectly melted cheese.  There isn't too much sauce on the pie like some places tend to do, so it is all well balanced. We were fortunate enough to go in on a day that the Zeppolis were part of the daily special.  They are little balls of fluffy doughey goodness topped with powdered sugar and a sweet glaze.  Soo good. The real show stopper was the order of garlic knots.  We were dining in one day and they brought us a big basket of them while we were waiting.  Holy shnikees they almost melted in your mouth.  A garlic version of a donut, but in an amazingly good way.  Definitely worth the couple dollars!   Overall, this is a great place to visit when you crave delicious food and a full belly."}
{"text":"Looked this place up on my trusty yelp app while staying at my girlfriends house. Not sure how they have 4 stars. Paid $27 for a buffalo chicken pizza and a Cesar salad. The pizza had trace amounts of buffalo sauce and a lot of grease, would have been great if it was flipped. I'm pretty sure the dressing they used for the salad can be bought at the local grocery store. To top it all off I am that guy that likes ranch with his pizza. Asked for some when I was picking it up and the guy who looks likes he's in charge turns to me and says it's 70 cents while he holds my ranch hostage. I threw a dollar on the counter and walked out with my pizza, salad and tablespoon worth of ranch. I definitely won't be giving this place another chance. Not sure why you would nickel and dime your customers when you're charging as much as you are with the poor quality of pizza you make."}
{"text":"When I first saw Classic Crust Pizza on Yelp, I couldn't believe the number of 5 star reviews. We ate there tonight and I can attest that Classic Crust Pizza truly deserves 5 stars. Nothing fancy about the pizza, it was a classic pizza too, and it was definitely done right. It reminded me of the pizzas we had in Spezia Italy years ago. Great crust! And great toppings! There was entertainment too. One could order super hot chicken wings if you signed a waiver. A customer completed the paperwork and was served a wing. He took one bite and looked like he had been gassed. He finished the the wing after a couple of trips to the rest room and several complementary servings of cream and milk to help quench the fire. We were served an introductory dessert called Zeppoli which was delicious. It will be a great hit once people know about it. A great time was had by all except the poor wretch who ate the wing."}
{"text":"Great pizza & excellent wings! They even have an atomic hot wing you have to sign a waiver to eat. No I wasn't brave enough to try it lol! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We never had a chance to try the food. We walked in on a Saturday night and just stood there. I finally ask the person behind the counter if we could sit anywhere since she never spoke to us when we walked in. She told us to sit where we like (it was empty except for the one person sitting at the the bar area). We waited, and waited and waited. Finally I got up and walked around to the front of the restaurant and stood there. The employee was involved in a conversation with the person sitting at the bar and didn't even look my direction. We left.  It was really creepy."}
{"text":"Went back - They had some Oven trouble unable to finish cooking Pizza, But apps and Wings were good and They made right on the oven trouble, some days are harder than others  - will be back"}
{"text":"Had a 12\" pizza that was phenomenal. Also ordered the garlic balls and those were great. If I lived in this area I would be at this place at least once a week.   Oh and btw the customer service is top notch! Great job to everyone at this pizza establishment."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! The pizza is always amazing!! The service and atmosphere are wonderful as well. This is right on my way home from work so it's become a regular for me. You can't beat the bianco verde will blow your mind!!"}
{"text":"Owner is super nice a-lot of great things coming for their vegans costumers nice to have a pizza joint that supports Vegans thank you classic crust  and just to add coming from Chicago it's great to have a good pie out here in Arizona don't skip this place must have pizza yum yum"}
{"text":"Dropped in to this place right by our house. Small place, you're supposed to order at the counter then sit and they'll bring it to you, although we saw a couple people sit and they were waited on by the owners. It was our first time so we sat at the small six stool bar to peruse the menu and ended up staying put. They had 4 really good local craft beers, plus blue moon and Coors light. After first beer, the rest are half price, so we had to have a couple brews. Wasn't really expecting much, but wow, I love thin crust pizza and this is thin crust pizza heaven. I think she said it's brick oven pizza. It's a very thin crust, but super good and the toppings on the classic combo we ordered were excellent. The owners are super nice, very personable. What makes them deserving of 5 stars, besides the great food, is the zeppoli . They are like bite sized sopapilla, but better because, well they're bite sized, plus they use agave nectar, which is lighter and thus less sweet than honey. The zeppoli truly are awesome. Overall, just a really great neighborhood pizza joint with excellent food, excellent beer, and nice people, I can see this place getting really busy as people start finding out about it. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"First and only place in the valley to accept bitcoin! So awesome. The pizza was awesome and the zeppoli was out of this world."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and save your money.  We ordered from here when they first opened and were way overcharged for toppings compared to what the online menu said at the time.  We decided to wait quite awhile before giving them another try.  Tonight, at 7:54pm, I placed an online order for one of their specialty pizzas.  The online delivery quoted me an 8:54pm deliver by time.  Although we had a super long day, my husband and I agreed that the hour we were being quoted was doable and we'd go ahead and order the pizza for delivery.  Seeing as I just had shoulder surgery and my husband randomly had hand surgery a few weeks prior, ordering delivery was by far the easier option than driving to pick up or even cook.  At 9:04pm, I called to find out where on earth our pizza was (keep in mind we live a mile from this place- not super far).  The guy on the phone had an attitude the second I questioned the whereabouts of my overpriced pizza.  He told me it would be 20 more minutes.  As soon as I began complaining, he said: actually, he's leaving with it right now. Sure enough, at 9:14pm, my pizza was in my house.  He also mentioned that \"the online system always quotes an hour, regardless of how busy we are.\"    OUR PIZZA WAS COLD  WHEN WE GOT IT AND THE CHEESE WAS ALREADY IN THAT RUBBERY, COAGULATED STATE OF HAVING BEEN COOLED DOWN/LEFT OUT.  Our pizza clearly had been done for some time and was just sitting there until I called.  This is not an appropriate way to run a business, the pizza was not that great, and the employees don't care if they bring it to you or not (even though they auto-added a tip and delivery fee in for me to my total).  I should have gone through the hassle of driving with my shoulder/arm in a sling to Pizza Heaven a handful of miles away and picking up a pizza that I know is going to be amazing instead of giving this place another shot.  We won't be back and I wouldn't be sad if they went out of business."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out and it was decent.  The buffalo chicken pizza is pretty good I must say. Also ordered The Classic Combo and with all the meat the box was a greasy mess and my husband liked it.  The crust is super good...hence the name...just a classis pizza crust with great flavor and texture!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch because the place I wanted to go to was packed. Got the two slice lunch special. The staff was very cordial but the pizza was lack luster with a tasteless soggy crust. Ended up throwing away the free yelp check-in order of zeppoli, too.  It was tasteless and chewy, obviously made from the same pizza dough the pizza was made with. Too many great pizza places in this area to waste another trip here again."}
{"text":"Pretty sure they put monosodium glutamate a.k.a. MSG in their sauce or something. I'm totally allergic to the crap. If you're going to use it you need to let people know! When I called and asked about it they kept saying we can't hear you what are you saying hello anybody there.   Cheesy little joint doesn't even deserve one star. The truth is this place rather than apologizing and checking out their Products to see WHERE the MSG is being used they blame my Cell service provider.   I guess next they're going to tell me it's my fault for being hungry and eating in the first place.  Just ask doctor google about it.  Do a little research MSG is found in chicken sausage ranch dressing Parmesan & dipping sauces!   I'm telling you I had an allergic reaction when I ate your food that's common with the symptoms of an allergic reaction to MSG.   I try to be nice about it and call you and communicate with you like an adult when that doesn't work I'm forced to leave a negative review.  You could've responded on yelp.  Randy please call me back would like to investigate this more. Instead you attack my cell service provider.  You showed a real lack of intelligence/understanding/education when it comes to the food service industry, in that you didn't even know MSG can be found in just about everything. Chicken, Ranch Dressing, Parmesan Cheese & sausage. Which are all very much a part of Italian food.  I use an iPhone 6+ on Verizon by the way"}
{"text":"Best. Pizza. Ever. My fiancé and I got the Italian Stallion and it blew our minds. The lady that served us was kind enough to let us try the Zappoli... More like little balls of crack. So delish!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I just had the most delicious chicken parmigiana sub and fries. Totally satisfied and they delivered in 15 from the time of order! Hands down the best grinder I've had in years. I'm not going anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Worse pizza I have had in Arizona hands down! Furthermore, I ordered garlic knots and they were absolutely inedible. Will never order from there again."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time. The pizza was kind of dry and lite on toppings. Disappointing. The wings were great!!!  I would go back just for those. Overall experience was ok."}
{"text":"I found Classic Crust Pizza via the Yelp app.  I followed the \"Menu\" link and placed my order for delivery thru the website the link took me too.  After pressing the \"place order\" button a message popped up and stated that my order had been placed for \"take out\".  I immediately dialed the number for Classic Crust and sure enough, the website a had sent the order to them as pick up.  While the guy I talked to was able to see my order, he wasn't able to change the order to delivery.  He told me he would have to cancel the order and resubmit it.  Assuming he could see my original order and would just duplicate it, I let him do it without question.   The order was delivered in a timely manner which as it turns out was the only thing that was good about our experience.  My wife is a New York Italian and is a pretty good judge of pizza.  We both agreed it was the worst pizza we had ever eaten.  Still not sure if we got what I originally ordered."}
{"text":"We order from Classic Crust about once a week and it awesome! Every single time! Large portion sizes, consistent service and taste. It is the best!"}
{"text":"I have only had the lunch special there, 2 slices and a drink. But man that turns out to be 2 lunches for me the slices are huge. I've tried, pepperoni, sausage, and spicy meatball and of course cheese slice. Every one of them has been fantastic toppings are fresh and plentiful, the crust is some of the best I've ever had. I can't wait to go back and have dinner there although this place is close to my work and I'll have to make a special trip for dinner. I think it will be worth it. !!!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible  ... not recommended.  Food was cold and poorly made.  No cheese on pizza and wings had zero sauce and dry"}
{"text":"Overpriced crappy pizza!!! We were staying in the area and saw this on yelp (which is usually very trustworthy) . Would have been better off with a frozen pizza. Hardly any sauce, toppings, or cheese so I guess you're paying for dough and a pretty box."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza restaurant. The name describes the product, great classic crust with the tastiest fresh toppings. Had the Bianco Verde with sausage."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings! We have the food delivered, it's always hot and fresh. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good pizza but slow and over priced.    A cool 50 for three people to eat and over 30 minutes to get food.  If you have excess money, time to burn and want a good pizza come check them out."}
{"text":"So this being my first time in I decided to try the hot wings.  That was the perfect choice for the hop shock beer!! Then a patron offered me a zappolli. It's a little doughnut hole looking thing that must be filled with crack... Because I couldn't stop eating them!!! Great place!!!! Top notch food and great service make this a great neighborhood pizza joint!!"}
{"text":"Price is affordable,  crust, sauce THE WHOLE PIZZA is delicious! !!! Count me in as a reoccurring customer!!!!"}
{"text":"We came for the classic car show Friday 6:30, we beat the rush and ordered before most of the people at the show. We got our pizza after everyone else.   We ordered wings, French fries and the bacon baller pizza. It took about 20 minutes for wings, 30 for French fries and 55 mins for pizza. The pizza was really good! The meatballs and ricotta were great compliments to each other and there was tons of bacon! We definitely recommend that pizza. The wings were super crispy but the sauce was just ok. The French fries were crispy with a huge portion but we will not get those again. They have some seasoning on them and maybe a little coating? Didn't taste fresh.   The place is cute and the people are nice. There were great beers on draft also! We may come back for the car show and grab a slice but won't go out of our way to return."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Drove by it a hundred times. Decided to stop tonight. Wings and fries. Both are excellent!!!!!  I will be back."}
{"text":"Classic Crust is a welcomed addition to our neighborhood. Their pizza is delicious and the crust deserves the honor of being the restaurant's namesake. The sauce is tangy and vibrant and all of their toppings are great, but I would especially recommend the sausage if that's your type of thing.   They garlic knots are a must try, in fact they probably have a Yelp check in offer to give you some free garlic knots on your visit, so yeah, do that!  I should mention they have local craft beers with 1/2 price refills because that's a real deal sealer for us beer lovers...it really encourages you to grab a refill or two on your pint!"}
{"text":"Amazing GF pizza!! Quaint little neighborhood family dining. Fresh toppings, huge menu options and awesome owners!  Eating local/Support local business"}
{"text":"Almost a year since my first review of Classic Crust - and they're better than ever!  Had the 2 slice special with my favorite slices (spicy meatball) for lunch today.  Yum!  Let's see, since they opened, ticket times are way down (efficiency!) The staff is great. New food items every once in a while as they try new things (try their pasta)  Did I mention I'm in LOVE with the spicy meatballs?  My boss was in town - he's from Jersey - he gave it two thumbs up, so it's not just southwesterner approved."}
{"text":"Really can't understand the average rating. Either idiots who think McDonalds is 3-4 star rating or friends and family members of this restaurant.   Pizza is bland, Blah and not very good.   I never seen such a stingy amount of toppings.  Pizza sauce is obviously straight from the can and ingredients are so cheap the amount of oil on a pepperoni pizza is sickening.  Now the restaurant owners are trying to block my review because it isn't favorable."}
{"text":"We just tried them for the first time last night because they are new and local. We ordered take out and got a small plain and a large spicy meatball which cost about $23.00. The meatball was very good but it seemed a little light on the toppings. Some slices had a good amount of meatball and others were lacking. The dough is thick and chewy as I like it. I LOVE ricotta on my pizza and I don't often places that add it but they do...I just wish there was a little more. The cold leftover pizza this morning was just as a good as when it was hot and fresh last night.  My husband picked it up and he said the place was very clean and neat inside. We will be back."}
{"text":"The pizza is okay but the service here is terrible. They ignore their customers - we had to ask for silverware, refills, our tab....just overall unimpressed. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"What a great find!  We had the Hawaii Five-Oh and the Italian Stallion pizza.  The crust was not too thick and the toppings were generous.  We had finished with our pizza and were chatting when the owner came by with a order of zeppoli - on the house!  They were fresh out of the fryer and were wonderful!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is terrific! We live nearby, but have never stopped by - today we did! Lunch was awesome, salad and pizza, which neither one of us could finish. Salad was crispy, fresh, and PLENTIFUL!! Pizza was humongous for just one slice, and very tasty. Our waitress, Annie, was adorable as well as helpful. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Seriously some of the most delicious pizza around.  Great family spot.  Awesome local beer selection and decent wine list."}
{"text":"This place is great. Owners and staff are so nice. Pizza is excellent. They use fresh ingredients, prices are great. They also offer all day happy hour but one get second half price!"}
{"text":"Delivered cold after almost 90 minutes. This is the second time and I won't be giving them another chance. Their process is clearly unorganized and there are plenty of other restaurants out there that operate better."}
{"text":"Ok this place you should drive MILES for!  We found this hidden gem in June of this year and it has always been consistent!  Fresh ingredients - pizza better than places I've had in NY and Chicago! The name of the place says it all but don't be fooled they have the best wings in the valley better than any wing place - made to order!  No kidding this place I would eat daily! Fries are freshly made / pizzas wings and fries - should I say more?  Rated"}
{"text":"The pizza was decent. Price is awesome. The service was good. The restaurant was clean. I would go back."}
{"text":"I have had the pizza here a few times...their speciality meatball is super good, love the sauce and the crust! The owners are really nice too! Would recommend checking it out! Good food and good people!"}
{"text":"The meatballs and sauce taste just like my family recipe! So good! Great place to relax, have an ice cold beer, eat some great food, and bring the family!"}
{"text":"We just moved to this area & we were so excited to find a place within walking distance that has great food & cheap beers. Try their thick crust pizza & if you're really brave you'll love their fire sauce. And the best part about this place..... SAN TAN beer on draft, AND happy hour all day long!! Buy one beer get the 2nd half off!! We'll ?efinately be back, many many times!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, decent grinders. A bit slow on delivery. Good customer service from the staff."}
{"text":"Was in the process of ordering a large Bianca pizza. The menu on Yelp shows $15. The gentleman I was speaking to said the same pizza would be $23+. I told him the price on Yelp was much lower and he said that the menu on Yelp had not been updated.... Very bait & switch feeling so I cancelled my order. Really a bummer because I was looking for a new place."}
{"text":"We had the margarita, the classic combo and pepperoni.  It is always good and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Tried classic crust for the first time tonight and have to say it is a pretty solid pizza. Grabbed a large pie with 5 toppings for take out and at 6:30 on Saturday night my pie was ready in about 15 minutes. I like that your pie is the same price for up to 5 toppings although i can see some folks being pissed if you only order cheese or 1 topping. Got the pizza home it was nice a hot and the ingredients were fresh. The crush had a nice chew to it but not rubbery. All in all I will check it out again and try some of the other menu items"}
{"text":"It is exactly what it looks like from the outside. I was hoping for a more \"Classic Italian Pizza\" product but it was basic strip mall pizza. Not bad but the 4 star reviews are misleading. The three times I have been there there was a complete sense of disorganization that made me feel as if I was intruding on a staff meeting. Sorry but it was less Classic Crust and more \"Classic Bust\" 3 stars is actually generous but I am feeling philanthropic."}
{"text":"Had the buffalo chicken pizza and it was awesome!! Only complaint is that it took a lite while but it was super fresh!"}
{"text":"Pizza donuts. I seriously think they should rename the garlic knots to be \"pizza donuts.\" They are absolutely delicious and the portion is ridiculously huge... which is OK with me! Imagine the texture of a slightly crispy cake donut with a slight hint of garlic complemented with the delicate tang of a sweet marinara... pizza donuts!   The pizza is good too... we had the meatball which is a house specialty and they boast that it is spicy. It is indeed! I thought perhaps a little too spicy... but the quality of the ricotta on the pizza was perfect! Still firm and delivering a mild, milky flavor.  There are some good beers to choose from on draft to wash it all down.   This is NOT your run-of-the-mill strip mall pizza place! Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This place is great!!! My favorite is the veggie pizza.  They use fresh, QUALITY ingredients and the perfect amount of cheese.  We always order from here when we have friends or family over for game night and everyone loves it!"}
{"text":"After seeing the ad in the New Times, I found all of these wonderful 5-star reviews here on Yelp! However, this can be a bad thing, since it can set expectations unreasonably high.   The biggest problem is the location. Because it's not located directly inside of my house, I have to go out in public to get there. That's a special occasion, so to find it in an old, run-down strip mall is a bit disheartening.  There is room for just 30 chairs inside. When it's about 2/3's full of customers, it gets very loud! I said, IT GETS VERY LOUD!!!  However, the owners did a great job making the place look (and sound) much better on the inside than it does on the outside!  I have confirmed, as stated in previous reviews, it takes 30-45 minutes to receive food. (counting chairs is one way to pass the time...)  They also have very young (pre-teen) children delivering food to customers and clearing tables. I absolutely loved this. Proof it's a hard working family and everyone contributes. I hope those kids know how lucky they are to be participating in the process of building an American Dream (and that the restaurant is not owned by Kathie Lee Gifford!)  At the counter you order and pay for your food, as you would at a fast food restaurant. I'd describe Classic Crust as a Bistro. Seat yourself, put the number card the table and then wait.    The LED lighting they have is very cool.   They serve beer, but also have a serve-yourself Coke-branded fountain machine with common Coke products as well as a stand-alone refrigerator with glass bottles of Coke products from Mexico (Coke, Sprite, Fanta and the standard plastic bottle of Dasani water  - also a Coke product.)  Some prefer the Mexican Coke because it contains real sugar versus high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) they use here in the states.   The menu is above the counter - a large chalk board with everything hand written. Someone in the family must have been a teacher...   The chalk board menu proudly states their Margherita pizza is made with 'fresh mozzarella.' It's not stale mozzarella? Great! The word 'fresh' gets thrown around way too much. It's implied you are serving fresh food. If the food isn't fresh, it shouldn't be served. The cashier clarified it was actually buffalo mozzarella. Can you guess what I am going to suggest? Did you get it? You're going to make me say it, aren't you? Replace the word 'fresh' with the word 'buffalo.' Thank you for playing along.  They offer a gluten free crust. I didn't try it, but I love that they offer it.   At what time does lunch become dinner? I only ask because there was a 'lunch special' listed on the board (2 slices of pizza and a soda for $6), but it doesn't say WHEN lunch is!  From the menu you can choose a personal pizza, a large pizza or an extra large pizza. Let me translate this for you - the large is a medium and the extra large is a large.   We ordered a large pepperoni pizza with 10 wings, and an order of zeppoli.  The pizza is a New York-style thin crust with puddles and puddles of grease. For me, it's just too much grease. I found the pepperoni too salty and the pizza sauce way too sweet for my taste. However, the pizza crust was truly classic! The pizza looked and tasted similar to Papa John's. I wish I had a small ramekin of melted garlic butter to go along with that wonderful pizza crust.   There were 3 flat screen TVs showing sports (no closed captions were on) and music from the Stones, Zeppelin, Humble Pie and even Mungo Jerry, was being played! Classic rock, Classic Crust and a Coca-Cola Classic! That's classic!  The chicken wings were good, however, they appear to be baked rather than fried. The wings had good flavor and the sauce was also very good.  Imagine my surprise to learn the 'zeppoli' everyone here on Yelp was raving about is nothing more than a donut hole/beignet/Indian fry bread! Was it good? Yes. Was it amazing and deserving to be called something other than 'donut hole' or 'beignet' to properly describe it? They could have just as easily called it pelline (look it up - get the joke...)  The prices were fair. Not too cheap, not too expensive. Other reviewers mentioned it was 'freshest' pizza they ever had. Pizzeria Bianco was the freshest pizza I ever had (not the best pizza I ever had, but the freshest!).   I want to reiterate that everyone working here seems like honest, hard working people trying to create the American dream. I'm jealous this is not my family. It is not my intention to disparage their efforts with my review and I apologize if it comes across that way.   Overall, if your expectations are set correctly, you shouldn't be disappointed. Five stars implies a great atmosphere, great food, excellent and timely service and good value. For me, Classic Crust falls short of that, but I think (and I hope) they can get there. It's really just a 3-star for me, but I gave them the extra star because it's clearly a genuine family business and I want to see them succeed!"}
{"text":"Delivery took over 90 minutes. Pizza was cold. Complained, but they didn't care or offer refund or a coupon to earn our business back. There are so many other great pizza joints (like Venezia's or My Pie, e.g.) that we won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Giving poor reviews makes me sad but dang, no thanks. Obviously the location isn't the best, but if a place has great food then I can overlook that! I think the worst thing was that it just smelled super weird in there. Not like food weird but kind of like a public bathroom with air freshener-type weird. That definitely made the dining experience less pleasant.  I got the blanco e verde pizza and I love white pizza so my expectations were somewhat high, as I had seen pictures of the pizza from here before and it looked good. Unfortunately the inside part of the crust was too soggy, there was too much ricotta, and it was somehow kind of flavorless. My sister got a meatball sub and did not like the meatballs much at all. I'm not sure what was wrong with them but she just did not like them, and she is usually not picky about meatballs. Also before leaving home, yelp told me I could get free garlic knots if I checked in. As soon as I got there and checked in, the offer disappeared! The people working there were nice, but otherwise nope. not coming back. I just can't tolerate the smell in there."}
{"text":"I live up the road and found this place via Yelp and was like ok, 5 stars, give it a go! Wow! this place has fantastic! Simple and friendly local owners! Great little beer selection and bar area! What we like to see!!! Best eaten after a Mountain bike ride!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite pizza in the area! They use quality ingredients on their pizzas, the crust, the sauce, and the toppings, which is rare for restaurants.  They have a great local beer selection too.  My fav pizzas are the buffalo chicken and the veg out."}
{"text":"Usually lunch-time pizza is just so-so as its been sitting for awhile but hubby and I were pleasantly surprised   We ordered the two slices and a drink for $6.95. I got the meatball plus the cheese slices. It was so weird biting into the plain cheese slice!  I felt like I was transported back in time when pizza had that old fashioned taste. Can't wait to order an entire pie -- if the precooked    Slices are this good, the fresh one has to be fantastic!"}
{"text":"Nice friendly staff. Got the garlics knots (which bread is house made) and they were excellent. Nice amount of them as well especially for $3. Marinara is house made and just as delicious. Also got the Italian chef salad for $8 was very fresh and got a large amount can be shared easily amongst 2 maybe 3 people.The Hawaii Five-oh was fantastic as well cooked perfectly. Glad tried this place definitely will comeback a lot!"}
{"text":"The pizza margarita is the best I've ever had. Perfect amount of sauce, fresh cheese and basil. The crust is not to crispy not to soft. The only place I will order pizza now."}
{"text":"Love the Margherita pizza and the ambiance at the bar. Friendly customers and staff all around."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for the first time tonight. Had the classic combo pizza and Asian wings. Both of them were delicious! The service was fantastic and the staff was extremely nice. I will definitely become a regular here. The owner Alex was genuine and you can tell he cares about his business. Plus I got to pay with Bitcoin. Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoy trying new restaurants. We decided after receiving coupons in a mailer to try this newer pizza restaurant. I looked online at their menu and called to inquire about their gluten free pizza as my daughter has celiac disease and cannot have gluten. After speaking with a gentleman over the phone and discussing it: I called again but this time to place an order. We ordered a medium combination pizza and a cheese and pepperoni gluten free pizza. We drove over and picked it up shortly thereafter.  It was delicious, hot and their sauce was really tasty. The crust was thin and really good.  We will return because they offer gluten free pasta as well that my daughter wants to try."}
{"text":"Great service and great pizza. The crust is a thin crust baked with just the right crisp. Garlic knots and Zeppoli is the way to go! Who knew knots of dough could be so good."}
{"text":"Finally. Great pizza in my neck of the woods!  Friendly, professional, and great food. Totally recommend this place.   The pizza was fresh and Did not taste like it came from a factory. The crust was just the right amount of crispy and chewy. Sauce was phenomenal and toppings were generous."}
{"text":"Do you want fresh?  Do you want a damn good pizza to melt in your mouth.  Then get your butt  here.  Wow, just wow!  Garlic knot rolls MEWOW! Oh my oh my oh my the Zeppoli are little clouds of heaven .  We order the a white spinach,ricotta, mushroom and olive pizza.  Mmmmmm!  Check in on yelp and you can pick. Free garlic knot rolls or Zeppoli."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall spot  that you will miss it if you're not looking friendly staff, very very basic Place.  pizza was decent. not sure if I need to go back as it is a little far from my house for just mediocre Pizza."}
{"text":"Good food, pizza is a bit greasy but not all the time. It really is good and the wings are amazing. I am definitely will be going back with more of my friends it's a good place to hang out and just eat some delicious pizza and wings."}
{"text":"Pizza was meh for brick oven pizza-certainly could've used more sauce. The fries weren't great, definitely under seasoned and mushy texture. The one saving grace is their large wings-great sauce and dripping in flavor and grease. Would I order here again? No except for their wings."}
{"text":"Spicy meatball pizza. Spicy meatball pizza. Spicy meatball pizza!!! This is my favorite neighborhood pizza.  Never disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Have had their Italian sliced sausage & Basil pizza with wings. Everything tastes fresh. The pizza slightly crunchy. The wings also have that slight crunchiness LOVE them! Can't wait to try more on the menu. Ariana is very helpful and sweet. Sat here had a glass of wine  while waiting for our to-go."}
{"text":"Great Pizza! Friendly employees. Highly recommended. They have 2 kinds if ice tea, both of which are very good. The salad was very fresh and when the pizza came out it was so good. I come from Hawaii and was visiting my son at nearby Arizona Christian University. We don't have pizza like this in Hawaii, unfortunately. Nice atmosphere and oh, by the way, the restroom is very clean as well. Next time I visit, I will definitely stop by Classic Crust Pizza again!"}
{"text":"The staff here are very friendly and so is the owner/manager. The pizza is delicious and so is the pasta. I recommend ordering the spicy meatball pizza. They hold car shows every 2nd Friday of each month and it's really cool. They have local beers on tap and if you're gluten free they have angry orchard cider. The wings here are really tasty too."}
{"text":"Love this place :) it's our local pizza joint.  The bacon baller is a great pizza, meat lovers also very good.  Trying their wings tonight for the first time.  Ordering online is always super smooth, prices are fair I think.  Check out their daily specials, too."}
{"text":"This place hasn't been here all that long and now that I've got a few pizzas from them it's becoming one of my favorite pies. The ingredients seem to be of high quality and I really love the crust. It's just the right thickness and chewiness for me. My favorite pizza is meatballs/ricotta/basil. Just killer. Plus they get brownie points for having a handful of local craft taps as well. I hope they stick around for a while! Update: one of the ways I personally rate a pie is what happens to the crust after it sits in the fridge for a night. Not an absolute measure, but this is a good cold pizza and if you stick it in the oven to reheat it, it might just be better than when it was a newborn. The crust gets a little crispy and still retains its chewiness. Good, good stuff. Spicy meatball all the way. Oh, and one more thing-they don't overload the pizza with cheese. I like the balance."}
{"text":"This place takes me back in time. In the good way!  We have been there twice now. The atmosphere is laid back and nostalgic. The music is all 70s rock. All they need is a little space for a pinball machine and Ms. Pac Man and it would really be a blast from the past! Service is great too. Both times the person behind the counter was a teenage boy but they were very friendly and helpful.  Both times we went we had the veggie pizza. The toppings are nothing fancy, tomato sauce good but standard. The crust is to die for! Buttery and garlicky. It melts in your mouth.  Last time we went we had a Groupon for a pizza, pasta and Zeppolis. The pasta was good but not as good as an Italian restaurant. I would not kick it out of bed! I put tons of Parmesan and red pepper flakes on top to kick up the flavor.  Then there are the Zeppolis. I am not a big fan of sweets. I rarely order dessert at a restaurant. When these came out I shrugged my shoulders. They were plain balls of dough fried and covered with honey and sugar. They didn't look like they would blow me away. Then I had one. It was delicious! The worst part is they get more delicious the more you eat them. So then you stuff yourself full and feel disgusted with yourself. To avoid this from happening, I suggest you only order these with at least 3-4 people in your party. If I had one suggestion to make, it would be great if it came with a little side of either strawberry sauce or chocolate sauce. Don't get me wrong, they are great by themselves, but this would knock it out of the park.  They have a small but decent selection of draft beers. They have a great special if you get one beer you get the second half price. My kind of place!"}
{"text":"Perfect crust, perfect sauce, well-cooked. Definitely coming back. Really cool that they take Bitcoin too."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in Phoenix. Half of our order was forgotten all together, what did get delivered was pathetic and borderline inedible. The manager at this restaurant was unwilling to refund my money for the forgotten food, or the four noodles and spoon of sauce they called \"baked ziti.\" The Zeppoli wasn't anywhere near as the reviews make it seem, NYPD Pizza is much better, which is sad, as they're a chain restaurant.  Terrible food. Terrible portion size. Terrible service.  This place won't be around long."}
{"text":"We decided since it was a gray and dreary night that we would head to Classic Crust Pizza. Luring my husband with the promise of a classic car show was more motivating than the fact that I did not want to cook. This place has a small seating area and our family filled a large back table.  The food is good, there's happy hour prices and the place has a nice vibe. Rather than pizza, I ordered my favorite fried zucchini under the guise that it was vegetables and therefore \"healthy\". Lightly battered, not greasy and served with a creamy ranch-style dipping sauce it doesn't take much more to make me happy. I helped devour the wonderful little garlic \"donuts\" (Tasted great but left a lot of grease on the bottom of the dish). There were several pizzas on the table and even though I had stuffed myself on the zucchini, my daughter enticed me to try the \"Bacon Baller\" (bacon, meatballs, ricotta--no red sauce). The combination was magic! I especially liked the Ricotta instead of mozzarella.  I dislike doughy pizza crust and Classic Pizza's crisp edges have just enough \"chew\" for my liking. Service is fast and friendly. Sadly, I think the 16 raindrops scared the car owners away since there were only 4 old cars while we dined, but we will continue to come here or order takeout."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza, 10 wings, and a beefy Italian sandwich. Pizza crust was burnt and so was the sandwich bread. The sandwich was missing the Au Jus which was the primary reason I wanted it. When I called the guy said 'what do you want me to do about it?' with an attitude. We brought back all the food for a refund. The refund is the only reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1 star. Not very happy about driving back and forth in 100 degree heat to end up with no food. Waste of time."}
{"text":"I found this place on GrubHub, ordered 5 pizzas -margherita, classic, buffalo, spicy meatball & bianco & garlic knots for delivery. Spicy meatball was a HUGE hit as well as the bianco. We all enjoyed the pizzas but those two were clearly the winners & I was told to make sure I order 2 of them for next time. If you are wanting your taste buds to dance with joy, I strongly recommend this place. Angie (who took my order) was very kind & the individual who delivered (didnt remember name-sorry) was very friendly & seemed excited to work for this restaurant. We have pizza parties every other Thursday & will be replacing our current place with Classic Crust Pizza."}
{"text":"The meatball pizza is FANTASTIC!!!  The Zeppoli is CRAZY GOOD!!  Fresh brewed tea from a local place here in the valley.  I highly recommend this great little place .. Locally owned and operated, TRY IT!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza crust was really soggy when I got it, and the specials were ok.  I love my pizza, but I just didn't catch what made this place any different than other pizza place."}
{"text":"Very good  pie. Great local tea. They take a little longer then other places.   But it is worth the wait!!!  Ask them about their deep fried dough sprinkled with powdered sugar!!!   SO GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Service is great,  clean place,  food is AMAZING!!! Will definitely be back.  Huge plus that they have gluten free as well.  Garlic knots are out of this world,  wings are awesome,  pizza fabulous."}
{"text":"I agree with Christina that the garlic knots should really be called pizza donuts. Yummmmm.   They have some local beers on tap and a good selection in bottles (including Angry Orchard for the cider lovers and/or gluten free people).   We started with the knots (free from the Yelp offer - woo hoo!) and mild wings. I love wings and Classic Crust's did not disappoint! The sauce was perfect, and even though I usually don't like going too spicy, I feel like I could have done medium on these ones. The mild is very, very mild, but very good.   We had a spicy meatball pizza (minus the red pepper flakes) which was also delicious. It's definitely thin-crust pizza without being a crunchy crust. This particular pizza had a lot of ricotta on it, which my husband liked, but I wasn't the biggest fan.  We finished up with the Zepelini (sp?), which I'm pretty sure is the same bread as the garlic knots except fried a little bit more and covered in icing and powdered sugar. Which is amazing.  Overall, great service and great food! We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday had the special. Large pizza and garlic knots with 10 wings. Pizza was great, garlic knots were very tasty, and the wings were crispy and flavorful as well. Would recommend this place to anyone going through PHX."}
{"text":"The pizza is thin with just enough grease New York style the way we like it. The garlic knots come out soft and donut like. Local beers with a small variety of styles. Owners are attentive and fun to be served by. Check-in on Yelp and get a free order of garlic knots. Fans are on and A/C is down which makes it a nice retreat from the heat."}
{"text":"Let me start with cleanliness; floors and restrooms were clean. I had a lunch special, which was two slices of pizza and a drink for $6. Good deal for lunch at a reasonable price.  The place is kind of small but the food is good. The pizza was advertised as oven pizza and was very good. My friend had the Meat ball sub which he let me try, it was magnificent.!  If I had a do-over I would order the sub. I will definitely come back and try the sub.   This is a good 4 plus place good for small groups."}
{"text":"I was going against the negative reviews, which I've learned tonight I should never do again. I literally just had food from Classic Crust delivered to my door 10 minutes ago  - yes, 10 minutes ago. I've been craving fettuccine Alfredo all day long and I was so excited to get this, but what I opened was a thing of dry noodles with MAYBE a tablespoon of Alfredo sauce. So basically I paid for dry noodles. I thought maybe I would find salvation in the Caesar salad but that was ruined ALSO, because it basically is drenched in the dressing so much that the lettuce is wilted. With two strikes on the board I thought maybe I would just have dessert for dinner I guess, and enjoy this zeppoli, since everyone talks so highly about them. I'm wondering if it's employees and owners that are writing the reviews because what I have in front of me right now is balls of chewy dough that's ridiculously difficult to eat. I'm very upset that I just wasted $25. And I'm still starving."}
{"text":"We had wanted to try the pizza for sometime.  My boyfriend placed an order online and was given a price for the pizza.  When I arrived to pick up the pizza I was told that there would be an additional charge for additional toppings. Claimed they tried to call us about the charge.  I didn't really understand their explanation but, said okay.  It was almost $22 for a 14\" pizza YIKES.   The pizza was average at best and certainly didn't appear to have much extra toppings.  Frankly not even worth the original online price of around $17.  Nothing unique or special about the pizza.   We called to complain and ask for a further explanation of why the price was different from the online quote - the guy who took the call was really rude - accused us of trying to cheat them by the way we ordered!!  Also called my boyfriend a liar.  NOT MY IDEA OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.   FIRST AND LAST visit!!!   Worst experience ever!! DON'T waste your money there are a lot of MUCH better pizza available in the area at places where the staff are customer friendly."}
{"text":"First time ordering online from this Restaurant and it was not cheap!    Fried Zucchini 1 $6.95  Tortellini Choice of Sauce: Marinara Add Extra: Marinara ($0.70 Extra) 1 $10.65  Italian Garden Salad (Large) Choice of 1st Dressing: Oil and Vinegar Choice of 2nd Dressing: Italian Add Extra: Grilled Chicken ($2.00 Extra)  Service was fast but the Salad did not include Croutons and the Chicken did not looked grilled to me see picture! The Romaine was damp the tomatoes and olives were like non existent! Fried Zucchini was okay. Had the Tortellini  it was just okay. Very disappointed that the Manager never even called me back!  When I called to complain the employee said he was not able to do anything since the Manager was not there and he would advise the Manager. Well I will not order online from here again!"}
{"text":"The Garlic Knots and Zeppoli. Just do this. The pizza is absolutely fantastic too! The crust was perfect and so was the sauce. But I have never in my life had Garlic Knots like this, and if you have ever been to Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans and had the beignets ITS THE SAME THING! They taste EXACTLY THE SAME, and they are FAAAANTASTIC!   We will be back here again. Loved the feel of the place, the price, the food, the cleanliness, and the service!"}
{"text":"Decided to try a new place tonight.  The pizza had awesome flavor, I just wish it was cooked a little more. Will definitely be giving this another try."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon for the classic crust combination meal  We ordered the combo pizza, and tortellini alfredo  The pizza had a thin crust and ample toppings but not so much sauce that it overwhelms  The though the sauce was quite thick, the tortellini Alfredo was fantastic, topped with ribbons of shaved Parmesan  The combination meal also comes with zeppoli, which is a sort of Italian donut, to me reminiscent of the Native American fry bread  They're quite delicious, and I believe they would pair well with a nice Italian espresso  I would consider ordering from this establishment for delivery, but honestly, I'm not likely to return simply based on the location"}
{"text":"Just tried Classic Crust for the 1st time... Ordered online through their app and received a wonderful pie may try delivery next time... But would highly recommend either way"}
{"text":"Tried this little place out last night. What a nice surprise! Quant little neighborhood pizza spot, looks nice & clean.   Beer was FREEZING and came in cold glasses just the way I like it.  As far as food... We LOVED the pizza! Crust was just perfect, thin but enough to hold pizza together, VERY TASTY and enjoyable. We ordered the classic pepperoni for the kids and a Veggie pizza. Both were great!   We ordered a salad, defiantly not the place for salad. It was just ice berg lettuce black olives and tomato, pretty bland.  But it's okay cause the pizza made up for it!   Service was great and they even gave us free dessert! The Zeppoli was YUM! When we got home I sprinkled some cinnamon and WOW even better.   Glad we have a new neighborhood pizza joint.   I highly recommend this place, will defiantly be back"}
{"text":"We will never go back again. Pizza small even though we ordered a large - mediocre taste - wings just OK and we got free garlic knots and they were gross and oily. Went because of all the good reviews but don't trust them."}
{"text":"Not an ideal location, but Classic Crust does have great pizza. On second thought, the location is not all that bad. If the line is out the door at Carolina's (next door) and you are not in the mood for Noodle & Rice (across the street), Classic Crust Pizza is a great choice. Mexican, Asian and Pizza! All the major food groups in one spot!    What to love about Classic Crust? The pizza crust! Wonderful consistency. Not at all \"yeasty\". Small, basic, modern, comfy dining room. Tables that can be rearranged for different size groups. Big screen televisions. Reasonable prices. Local ownership. Local beer. A Yelp deal for free garlic knots or free zepolli, light bundles of bready joy.    We ordered two signature specialty pizzas on this visit. Both were great. We used a paper coupon and the staff still kindly honored the Yelp bonus, even though they could have easily denied one discount or the other based on the fine print. We'll be back due to that treatment alone. They were also very patient when a six year old insisted on helping place the order for our party of six. Very nice. There's also a great two slice lunch special.  The brief history of the restaurant, quickly progressing from a portable brick oven to taking over a failed pizza parlor location (early 2015), might suggest the owners are getting a bit ahead of themselves. This is not the case. Yelp reviews have been very complimentary and an Arizona Republic write-up was outstanding. All well deserved."}
{"text":"I was really underwhelmed by this place.  After reading the reviews I was hoping after a year of being is this neighborhood my wife and finally found a good pizza and wings place.  That wasn't the case. The pizza was soggy, very limp and the sauce for the wings tasted like an hot ranch concoction, very wierd. the wings were crispy which is hard to find so that's good."}
{"text":"Pizza is not consistent. Used to order all the time. I feel like they went cheap on there ingredients(toppings) to maintain cost ratio. Plus the price is never the same for the same dang pizza"}
{"text":"Tonight we redeemed a groupon for a pepperoni pizza, fettuccini Alfredo, and Zippoli for dessert. We also paid $4 extra per soft drink.   Let's start off with the quality of the food: The pizza was greasier than a high school boy's face. It was ridiculous.   The Alfredo? It had the flavor of microwaveable pasta and the same consistency.   Zippoli? Eh. It was super sweet on the outside but had no taste once bitten into.    Besides that the atmosphere was awful. Nobody was in the restaurant and the service provided from the employees was horrible as well."}
{"text":"We got a takeout pizza from Classic Crust.  It was on time and what we ordered.  However, I did not think the quality was that good.  Certainly not a four star pizza in my opinion.  Three stars is as high as I would go."}
{"text":"Super nice place.  Decor was clean and the service was friendly.  Previous reviews mentioned the Meatball Pizza.  I usually don't like meatball pizzas because they usually taste like ground up hamburger on top of soggy bread. But since it was recommended, my family gave it a shot.  Wow.  I am a convert.  The meatballs were spicy and the bread was perfect.  I am going to go back and give the meatball sub a try.  The fried zucchini was tasty and the fried bread desert (don't remember what they are called) was a really great way to top off a good meal."}
{"text":"The flavors are good, the delivery is speedy, the price is a bit too high for what you get.  The pizza was a little greasier than I like, and the sauce a tiny bit bland-but not bad at all. They lose two stars from perfection for a low price to value ratio, and for not really having a memorable pie."}
{"text":"Tried this place out yesterday and went in and had 2 slices of their pizza.  The place was surprisingly completely dead in the heart of lunch hour.  I mean, it was just me for a full hour?!?!  I guess that should have been a sign.  At the very end of my lunch hour, 2 more customers finally came in.  The inside of the place is very nice, especially for a strip mall location.  While waiting, I asked about the delivery radius and gave the lady my street address and she said \"I got you\" that they could deliver to me.  I was excited to have a new pizza place to order from in the area.  Ordered from them today at 2:10 pm.  They said it would be about 40-45 minutes.  No problem, that's pretty fair.  After exactly 1.5 hours I called to ask the status and they said \"Oh you're 1 mile out of of delivery range\".  That's pretty frustrating considering yesterday they said it was fine, and today when they took my address, no issues at all.  They didn't call back to tell me, even though it was fine yesterday and fine today when they took my order.  It's a husband/wife owner, the husband asked his wife if she tried to call back and she flat out lied and said she tried to call back to let me know, but no missed calls on my recent call list.  The male owner was very argumentative and unapologetic.  As many of the other reviewers stated, expensive for what you get and very poor customer service.  I don't expect they'll last too long, so hopefully the next pizza place in this location will be able to deliver better honest customer service."}
{"text":"We really, really wanted to like this place. The food looked delicious, however we never got a chance to taste it.    Went in last weekend (10/30) at 7:00 pm. Starving! There were a couple of people in line, a few people at the tables, and four people at the bar (4 bar stools total at the bar). We browsed the menu and decided to order take out and have a beer while we waited.  Two seats opened up at the bar, and we got our beer.  Tried to pay then, but the cashier said he would cash us out once our food was ready.  I had Kiltlifter, my boyfriend had Scottsdale Blonde.  Beer was nice and cold.    From where I was sitting, I could see right into the kitchen, watching them hand toss the dough and make everything fresh.  Getting a bit more hungry now, after about 8-9 minutes I heard them call out our order in the kitchen \"take out - Italian (sandwich), baked ziti, garlic knots\". Yes! We were up next.  Then, that's when it all seemed to fall apart.    After 20 minutes, our beers were finished, another couple had come in, ordered, sat down next to us. In the kitchen I kept hearing \"I need those garlic knots,\" about every 3 minutes. After another 15 minutes, the couple next to us got their wings.  The kitchen counter had a few pizza boxes lined up that the staff kept opening, peeking in, and leaving sitting there.  Seemed to be some chaos in the kitchen.  The delivery guy was wandering around between the kitchen and the bar.  \"I need those garlic knots,\" yelled again.    By this time I'm starving and the man tossing the dough in the kitchen kept looking at me, pretty sure he could sense my frustration as I'd been sitting there watching them for nearly an hour.  And still had no food and no explanation.  The curly haired cashier didn't even check back to see if we wanted more drinks.    At this time, my bf stepped outside for a smoke. I noticed the cashier grab the wings from the people next to me, take them to the kitchen and pour some kind of syrup all over them, bring them back out and plop them down.  The customers said, \"wow, he is angry\".  Meanwhile he is 4 feet away from them completely ignoring us.  They looked at me and asked if we were getting food.  I said, well, it's been an hour. An. Hour!!! And we had no food.  Still, the cashier ignored us. Even though he was standing right in front of us.  The other customers said they'd been there before and usually it was very good, but tonight was not.    A man came in to pick up carry out, the cashier grabbed a to go bag from one of the warming bags on the counter, handed it to the guy. The guy told him he'd ordered three pizzas, not pasta.  The cashier went back to the kitchen, came out and told the guy that they had burned his pizzas and they were making new ones.  He then put the to go bag he tried to give that guy back into the warming bag.    Then for some reason, the cashier grabbed the to go bag from the warming bag, the same one he tried to give to the other customer, and slid it in front of us, saying, your food is ready.  I sort of chuckled saying how he tried to give another customer my food, no reaction. Ummm....but where are the garlic knots?? He went to ask the kitchen, but by this time we peeked at our food.  The lettuce and tomato on the sandwich were all wilted and warm, the bread was soggy.  The garlic knots were nowhere in sight.   Absolutely no apologies or sense of urgency or even acknowledgement from the staff.  We said, know what? We are out.  It's been an hour now.  My bf said let's pay for the beers and go.  The cashier offered nothing. No apologies, no beer is on the house, he did absolutely nothing to keep our business or smooth it over in any way.  In fact, he snatched my bf's debit card, swiped it, slammed the receipt and pen down for him to sign. Not a single word.    And we walked out, starving.    Like I said, the food that was coming out of the kitchen looked good.  I'd like to like this place as it is so close to my house, but the staff made absolutely no effort to let us know what was going on with our order. The cashier, the delivery driver who was hanging around, the guy in the kitchen tossing the dough, all of them clearly saw us sitting there empty handed for an hour and did nothing.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Stay the heck away from this place!  We ordered pizza and hot wings for delivery.  They told us 45 minutes to an hour.  At 1 hour 20 minutes we called to find out if they were on their way.  Instead, the guy who answered the phone was a snot, and hung up on us before saying that we're holding up our delivery by calling him.   Mind you, all we asked for was a status on our pizza after waiting for almost 90 minutes.  We didn't call up rude, screaming, or yelling.  We just asked the status.  So, after he hung up on us, we called back, and asked to speak to the manager or owner.  Apparently, he is the owner.  So we told him to cancel our order due to his complete rudeness to us on the phone.  He started yelling, and told us off again.  If this is how you run a business, you're not going to be in it very long.  STAY AWAY!  The worst customer service I have experienced for a pizza joint."}
{"text":"Interesting Pizza Joint that's been open for about a year-and-a-half. Has a good daily happy hour on beers and wine. The pizza is New York style and pretty tasty for Arizona. They also have a daily lunch special two slices and a drink for $6. Any of their slices are included. Plus they're slices are huge. They come from a 22 inch pie. You can see in my pictures the scale of the slices next to the fork or my hand"}
{"text":"I wonder if the great ratings are from friends of the owners because I cannot fathom this place getting that many great reviews. The 4 star review this place was rocking here made me think I'd give it a chance - the place that was there before it was terrible and I felt like I got suckered into trying that one.  This place is a step up, but ultimately not worth the calorie count.  If I'm gonna tuck into some pizza and wings and spend those hard earned calories, I want it to be worth it.  Or at least warm.    So, we ordered for pickup.  I tried to order online, but the website is ridiculously suck-tastic.  Both the listing of food and the actual program to be able to order online are not set up well.  When I told the person on the phone, she defensively stated that lots of people have said that and the website wasn't her thing.  No apology, no assurance that the correct people would be informed.  YIKES.  When I called the place and the wait time was 35 minutes I thought that was a little on the long side, but it was Saturday at 6:30 so I figured maybe I was being too hard and they were busy.  My husband picked up right on time and we live 3 minutes away. They were not busy. Upon opening the boxes, I found that everything I ordered was cold.  The Asian wings were a bit over-fried, but the sauce was good.  The garlic knots were over-fried chewy balls of dough.  If that's your thing, then they were great. I think if the pizza would have been warm, and it was the only thing we ordered I might feel differently about this place, because the meatballs on the pizza were good. Since it was cold, the crust was tough. I'm not expecting piping hot because we picked up, but I don't expect it to be cold either.  I won't be going back, nor will I be recommending to any friends - the food was MEH and I probably won't even save the leftovers.  I hope the next pizza place that goes into that strip mall learns from its predecessors."}
{"text":"Does not look like advertised, was just warm when we picked it up. Garbage foods and way overpriced for a warm pizza. Never again will I try a pizza shop in phoenix."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and thought we'd give this place a try. I must say they provide VERY friendly service. Happy hour all day when you dine in (1/2 off your 2nd beer). We ordered 2 pizzas. One being the meatball pizza with their in house crust. Not bad, more like, just okay. The gluten free pizza crust is NOT made in house, therefore it didn't really stand out either. Their garlic knots are more like garlic doughnut holes, light, but not what we were expecting. Our salad was simple, but tasty. Overall, the food is mediocre but the staff is great."}
{"text":"This place has been consistently good - from the pizza, to the pasta, to the salads and to the wings.  Their zeppoli and garlic knots are also pretty good, too. We've eaten there several times and the last 2 times, there was a group there having a bitcoin meeting - the only issue I had was there was a lot of cussing going on and I had my 2 kids with me...eventually we took our food to go and went home.  But other than that, service has always been great.  We will be an ongoing customer."}
