{"text":"The entrance is gorgeous. Outside there's a ton of trees that line the top of the building and it's beautiful when it lights up at night. The main entrance is also a sight to see, with waterfalls, fish, a cage with parrots, super high ceilings painted like clouds; this reminds me of the Venetian hotel in Vegas with the indoor village that is made to look like you're outside in a town in Venice. We sat in the aquarium room, which I've heard is the nicest. One entire wall has a built in aquarium with various types of fish. It wasn't bad, but it looked like it was in need of some cleaning with the semi couldy water. The place was ram packed. I think all of Brampton was there that night. Thank god we booked a table in advance because the line was out the door!

The buffet is good for what it is; westernized Chinese food. If your a fan of that, then you know not to expect \"authentic\" Chinese food as these dishes are made for buffets and have a generic taste to suit everyone's pallet. Nothing wrong with that, but I prefer ordering from a menu where I can customize and more effort is placed on that ONE dish, instead of a dish to feed the masses. 

They do put forward a huge selection to suit everyone, I must say. The buffet price is not cheap, so keep the carbs at a minimum. My favs that night were: crab legs (SO sweet! Oh and lady at the next table with 2 plates piled with a foot of crab legs...this is a buffet and clearing out the tray outside is not necessary!), mango salad was sweet and spicy, the green beans were also spicy and cooked well, grilled steak was tasty, prime rib was a bit overcooked for me, but it was still pretty soft and tastes awesome with chili currant sauce, torpedo shrimp was extra crispy and piping hot, glazed salmon was very moist and flaky, curry chicken had a good flavor (Chinese curry, not west Indian/Indian), Kung pao chicken wasn't bad either, black pepper steak was very well seasoned, macaroni salad taste was reminiscent to something from my childhood that I liked. These offerings stretched me to two plates with a bit of each. Kudos to those that pile their plates high and finish them!

Dessert was really good. Chocolate covered strawberries, waffles/whipped cream/strawberries (I cut off 1/2 a waffle), creme brûlée was bloody good, creme caramel was alright, strawberry shortcake, rum balls, chocolate ice cream, tiramisu....yup that's what I had. And I'd do it again.

There's a lot of other selections that's there that I haven't even mentioned. It's worth a try, and honestly it's a Chinese buffet not a Michelin star rated restaurant so bear that in mind before passing judgement. I think they go above and beyond in decor, service, and food quality. I am so hungry now!"}
{"text":"The food is allways the same, but great.
The people are nice. 
BUT they tend to rush you through your meal,
so that the next costumer can come and eat!"}
{"text":"Shortly after moving to Brampton, this was the first buffet place my in-laws took me to.  I've been back several times since, with good reason.

The only issue I have is that the Mandarin is so good that there's often a wait to get in if you haven't made a reservation.  

Once you're inside, you get a huge selection of food, with a good mix of Chinese and western food (their prime rib and Yorkshire puddings are quite good).  There's a great balance between spicy foods, and other food that won't leave my wife grumbling about the heat.  A word to the wise - although the spicy chicken is not particular spicy in and of itself, there are some small red peppers included that pack a pretty potent kick.

The staff are very friendly, polite, and helpful.

All in all, a great experience, and one I look forward to repeating in the future."}
{"text":"I like this Chinese buffet. the food and environment are very good."}
{"text":"This place not only has grand aesthetics and a welcoming atmosphere, the food is great as well. This place is the very definition of Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place is Huge! Tons of choices, far too many to try in one visit. If you like Asian you've got to give the Mandarin a try."}
{"text":"I have been going here for 25 plus years and their food has always been great.From where they started on Queen st to where they are now has always been the same- great food great service good prices takeout or eat in ."}
{"text":"Tatsächlich einen Besuch Wert, sauber, zahlbar, vielseitiges Buffet - Achtung, Dessertbuffet beansprucht auch noch Platz im Magen. Freundliche Bedienung, unter den Chinarestaurant top!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how anyone can like the food at Mandarin.  It's disgusting.  It's not even real Chinese food.  The sushi doesn't have raw fish in it, it's just rice and cucumbers."}
{"text":"Great Asian buffet ,, rich in variety , difficult to describe each and everything...suffice to say : it is GREAT"}
{"text":"This place is f***ing huge. There is an endless variety of chinese/asian food. I am a huge shrimps fan so I was never disappointed here. They have a pizza bar, sushi bar, etc. and all the food is made in real-time so you know you are getting fresh food.
It can become very pricey during the weekends. Over the years, I feel the quality of the food has come down. 
Overall a good choice for Chinese buffet."}
{"text":"I have always been slightly skeptical of Chinese buffets but after much convincing from my boyfriend, my first time to this Mandarin location in Brampton was a delightful surprise. From the moment we entered the restaurant, it had a 'Vegas' style feel to it, with the waterfall and parrot cage at the front of the restaurant, to the room with the exotic birds and of course the gigantic tropical aquarium, which we had a table right next to. It definitely made for a very interesting dining experience as we saw many different kinds of fish (incl. a puffer fish!) swim by and even a scuba diver cleaning the tank that night. Lots of variety, but our favorites were the torpedo shrimp, sushi rolls, bbq section, sweet potato fries, and the cookie monster drink. Service was great, as the staff were all friendly, responded to our requests, cleaned the tables quickly, and even the hostess helped us to take a few pictures as the restaurant was closing. Had a wonderful time there and definitely look forward to going back  =)"}
{"text":"An institution in Brampton as one of the best buffet places anywhere. I have eaten there dozens of times and never been disappointed. When my relatives from the States come to visit, they all make it a must to go for dinner at least once at Mandarin."}
{"text":"First time here and it was very nice... Food was good and fresh, everything I tried was very good. Many choices no matter what you are in the mood for! I will go back when in the area again.. The fresh fruit and deserts were a bit overwhelming couldn't make my mind up had to try so many now I'm over stuffed. Only negative thing I could say is I had a fruit fly buzzing around my table off and on."}
{"text":"Dear Mandarin, my family, friends and I went to your buffet on March 20 for a night out before the end of March Break as a treat for the kids. We went to your buffet for the following reasons: 1) we have never been to your flagship store 2) our kids really enjoy your restaurant and 3) YOU advertised \"50% off the buffet for kids 5-12\". Well, all of our kid's age from 6-12 fall under that criteria. Also, there were no small prints, otherwise I would notice that. Lo and behold, when our bill came, all the kids were charged the full kids price of $15 per child. We nicely inquired your manager why the kids were charged full price when you CLEARLY advertised it on your website that kids are 50% off. Your manager's explanation was that it is half price \"off of the adult price for kids.\" How would that make sense when your regular price for kids are already \"half the price ($15) of an adult price.\". So according to your advertisement, kid's price should be $7.50. Either I am very terrible at math or YOU are giving out FALSE advertisement. You make false advertisement to lure customers to your restaurant. How shameful!! How desparate!! What else are you lying about in your restaurant? Did your food inspection pass because you lied? As you guess by now, I am one very unhappy customer. I know you don't care for one very unhappy customer because you still have hundreds or maybe even thousands of customer. But you clearly lied without reservation to YOUR customers. Shameful!! By the way, a few block away, Spoonful or Wok of Fame is much better!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, the place is decorated like a garden, with themes for dinning areas.
Bring your appetite, the beef mushroom tasted like ribeye meat. Every thing you'll taste - you will love."}
{"text":"Can I just say.... WOW
This place is unbelievable! It's an experience in itself! My mouth was open most of the time (until I was eating of course ;) ) because of the decor, the cleanliness, the staff friendliness and attentiveness, the presentation of the food and the whole ambience was just unreal! 
It is a Chinese restaurant but has a section down the end with beef and mashed potato etc, they have sushi bars and desert sections, salad sections and ice cream bars.. I don't even need to explain, the pictures will speak for themselves! I could have taken pictures all day but people were looking and it was too busy :) it's a self service, so you'll be shown to your table and asked what drink you would like to order, and they constantly refill free of charge, there is always someone cleaning plates away and refilling Drinks, they don't stop for a minute! So attentive! 
So once you're shown your table you go up and help yourself to whatever food you like, and you can go up numerous times! I had 2 plates (lowering head in shame) as I got greedy at all the delicious food and then a desert plate! 
AND the bathrooms were immaculate! You could have eaten your Chinese from the toilet bowl (if anyone fancies that option ) 
All in all, just an epic experience! Went home stuffed and happy.. I need to be rolled into bed #foodcoma
I will be back MANY more times!! Fantastic place"}
{"text":"I came here on the weekend for lunch. We did not have reservations so my dining companions and I got here before they opened on Sunday for lunch. Good thing we did. This place gets packed. Crazy packed. It's super busy and it's like a feeding frenzy at the buffet tables after 12PM. Fortunately I was pretty much onto dessert by the time the hordes were clustering around the entree tables. 

Let's be honest here: this isn't gourmet food. It isn't authentic Chinese food. This is North American Chinese food. For what it is, Mandarin does it very well. Nothing is going to blow your mind here. If you like seafood (I don't), they appear to have a good selection. Some of the dishes were lukewarm at best which leads me to believe that the warming tray temps weren't set high enough. That's the only reason why I would knock a star off. 

The service is impeccable. Gracious, polite, efficient, super friendly. No complaints here whatsoever about the service. 

I rarely go to buffets because I hate that sick feeling I get after I force myself to eat two plates of food and one plate of food would seem like you're not maximizing your buffet cost especially since I don't eat the expensive items like seafood. I also don't like the majority of the type of people who come here. People who go to the Mandarin in sweat suits or ratty jeans and sneakers. People who pile up their plates to the sky as if they were only allowed one plate and have to make the most of it. People who make a mess of the buffet or washrooms. It's because of those types of people that I probably only go to the Mandarin a couple times a decade."}
{"text":"Welcome to Mandarin!

I've had my best Mandarin experiences at this location.  During my most recent visit, I was welcomed at least five times on my way in (no exaggeration) and welcomed again mid-meal while I was getting sushi.  There is more than enough staff around to make sure the food is always fresh and topped up, your empty dirty dishes are taken right away, you always have clean napkins and your water glass is always full.

I enjoy the décor at this location.  From the grand exterior and gigantic trees at the entrance to the massive aquariams in the fish room and the unique aviary in the bird room.  There are also little details like fruit sculptures hidden throughout the food stations.

I hear the prime rib guy at this location is extremely friendly, but I didn't get the opportunity to meet him."}
{"text":"Update:
Subsequent to our disastrous visit to the Mandarin flag ship store we were contacted by phone and asked to make a return visit with a meal for 2 on them.  Suggested it was a bit too soon and suggested they email the verbal offer, that suggestion was refused.

Received another call two days later asking when we would return.  We suggested it would not be until after Easter.  Again told to just reserve and ask for 'Sam' when we arrived.  Again suggested it was to soon and the bad experience was still too fresh in our mind.  

We were told a letter would be sent that we could present when we arrived, that would confirm a gratis meal for two for lunch or dinner.  Now April 20/18 and still no sign of a letter.  This leads us to believe the offer was mear lip service and never expected to be taken up.

Sad really because their history was great but perhaps success has breed apathy from a customer service perspective."}
{"text":"What can I say about The Mandarin that hasn't been said by others. It is the gold standard for Chinese Buffets. The food is fresh and unlike a couple of other Brampton buffets, you can count on it being hot. The décor is pleasing. I like both the bird room and the fish room. There is a wide variety of Chinese items as well as some items aimed at North American tastes. There is an extensive salad bar and a great desert bar. I have eaten here many times and I have ordered takeout from this restaurant numerous times. It has never disappointed me."}
{"text":"Shockingly good for a buffet. Everything was tasty, fresh, and good quality. Went on a Thursday night at opening and there were already people waiting. The place is huge though, so there was no wait. 

The service was also really good - as they take you to your table they point out the various stations, drinks and plates were refreshed quickly, and you are given hot towels before and after the meal. 

It's in a bizarre location in the middle of an industrial park, but it was only a five minute walk from my hotel. 

I can't believe I'm highly recommending a Chinese buffet, but this was a really good one."}
{"text":"Great oriental buffet !
Food is fresh
Rest is clean
Easy parking
Service - good
Value - good.
Recommended."}
{"text":"We went for a free birthday meal on a Saturday night and the place was jammed, turning people away. I have never seen so many people in a restaurant - so many in fact that at times you could not get to certain buffet stations. We also had to wait 35 minutes with a reservation! And the expensive price $33 is also a negative but I have to say it was worth it and you should go out of your way to go to this particular location because the selection of food is awesome and its clearly higher quality that other similar buffets I have eaten in over the years. They also took a photo of the birthday girl as a momento.  They also have a 20% discount for seniors so if you go for lunch its a lot cheaper although I doubt whether it is the same selection."}
{"text":"The best Mandarin I've been too! Love the decorations. Wish they had better description on food though I got candy covered tomatoes last time I went that was a gross surprise! Wish they had plain Egg Drop Soup"}
{"text":"Poor quality of food 
 
My experience was really bad at mandarin's Brampton location  because I found plastic string kinda thing in my kelp salad. It was the same color of the kelp but when I took the first bite, I was able to tell that there is something wrong with it. And I endup pulling the plastic string out my mouth which was served in kelp salad. And I had to ask three times to the server to get the manager attention. The manager didn't really take it serious and told me that I will only pay half for my food. Which is not the solution to the problem. I'm really disappointed with the quality of food that they are serving."}
{"text":"The best Mandarin Restaurant I have ever been to! I come here almost once a week with friends and we always love it. The food is always hot and topped up. So many options and everything is so delicious.

The craziest thing about this place is the staff. THEY ARE UNBELIEVABLY GOOD! All super friendly and welcoming. Drinks brought to you immediately. Napkins changing frequently. I dropped food on the floor and was going to pick it up and a staff member beat me to it and told me \"Don't worry sir - I got it!\". I can not believe how well trained the staff is."}
{"text":"Mandarin: a fish tank is not a bird tank. Please provide a larger home for your obviously unhappy birds. Seriously. This made me lose my appetite."}
{"text":"The other night I ordered some food from here, their honey garlic chicken wings were raw, family members got sick. Called the store they came to take food back,  and gave me a full refund"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The outside building is incredibly impressive. When we went inside, we were happily even more impressed. I have been to all sorts of Chinese buffets, but nothing like this. The presentation of food is exquisite. This is not the normal food slapped into a steam tray.  Here each station is a beautiful presentation. The serving areas were spotless, but even so there were people constantly polishing and cleaning the food areas. 

Then to the food itself. Each item I selected would stand on its own as being excellent if ordered from a menu. Plus the variety is amazing. Then there is the staff. Each one we encountered was very friendly and had a smile for us.

The only negative things I can say is that we don't live anywhere in the area, and unfortunately won't be able to return for a long time. If we did live there, we would certainly be regulars. The other negative is that my stomach would not expand to accept all the other dishes I wanted to try.

Before going here we read the various Yelp reviews of other competing \"similar\" restaurants. I really don't understand how they even can be mentioned. This place is fantastic and I am so glad we did not succumb to the reviews for the other restaurants."}
{"text":"My only question is why is this Mandarin more expensive than the rest they buffet is the same size as the rest they just have more seats"}
{"text":"I went back to this location a few months ago and the flavor of everything has improved, and their buffet selection is better now too."}
{"text":"This location is the HQ of Mandarin. It's great and a different experience from the rest of them. The service is much better here than any other Mandarin... But the food is different everytime I come back."}
{"text":"If I have to go to the Mandarin, I'll always try to come to this location. This place is huge and this is where the corporate headquarters is located too. 

This franchise has been around for a long time and it was one of the first buffet restaurant that I remember going to. Although it started out as a Chinese food buffet, it seems like they have evolved to include different dishes now. The layout of the food display is consistent to all of their restaurants. You have areas of hot Chinese food dishes along with soups, salads, meats and western food (pizza, roast beef and fries) along with sushi and desserts. 

Overall, the food is good. You won't go hungry in this place and somebody will find something to eat. We came on Christmas Eve for lunch with my in laws here right when it opened at 11:30am. It was convenient to come here and not worry who can or cannot eat something. 

We were seated in the Bird room and service was very attentive. There were no special dishes being served at the lunch service. 

Recommended."}
{"text":"One of the most elegant Asian buffet I have been to in a non Asian country

Food was alright, nothing special.  Pretty much same quality as some of the well know Asian buffets in NJ.  The old \"East Buffet\" in flushing NYC would have beaten this restaurant  in the food category.

However, I must say that one must a least try once to see the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Mandarin is the \"Tim Hortons\" and/or \"Pizza Pizza\" of Chinese food: create a product that's suitably and consistently bland, hype it endlessly, and the people will trample each other to get to your door.
  95% of their food is so innocuous my grandmother would happily eat it; even the \"hot sauce\" they give you isn't really hot. On the few occasions I have been pushed into going there, I noticed that most people seem to fill up on carbs, which explains why they are so profitable...who can eat $30 worth of carbs?
 Their chicken wings are OK, and a couple of their pot stickers are palatable. Additionally, if you want to spend ages ferreting out tasteless crab meat from flimsy legs, well, knock yourself out.
  To paraphrase H.L. Mencken: \"No one ever went broke underestimating the palate of the Canadian public.\""}
{"text":"If I feel like a buffet, and if I feel like Manderin. Then its gotta be Brampton location.

Beautiful interior and setup. The tropical aquarium and birds. Let you take a break so you could refuel yourself after. 

Food choices are awesome. Desserts, sushi, plus everything else. ***** thumbs up"}
{"text":"Good place for Chinese buffet though most of the dishes were bland and kept there for long, specially the desserts. Good place for once a year sort of thing."}
{"text":"I am not a buffet person at all but I came here to check out their Chinese New Year special. I must say that everything was fresh, delicious, and they had a ton of selections. Our service was Amazing too which was a pleasant surprise. They have everything here from Sushi, Pizza, Chicken Balls, Ice Cream, Frozen Yogurt, Ribs, Fried Rice, Peking Duck, and I could literally go on Forever and ever.

This Mandarin so beautiful as well. The Xmas lights look like a small city and there is a TON of parking outside. Lots of great photo opportunities as well! If you are really really hungry make sure you come here as you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times already while visiting since my family lives just up the street. I went last Wednesday (92/15) and was just as pleased as previously.

The food was fresh and cooked to perfection. Clean and presentable. Lots of options. Our serve was nice although he never came back and asked if we wanted refills. We only saw him when we initially seated and then when it was time for the checks. I had my 1yr old nephew with me and they were extremely accommodating. They did charge us $2 for feeding him food off of our plates (he had like 3 French fries)

Overall I think it was well worth the price. Next time we will go on the weekend so we can get some crab legs."}
{"text":"I love their decor, as for food it is pretty average, a tad white washed. I want to rate this 3.5 but ... There is no half star"}
{"text":"I've had a few work lunches here, and it is very enjoyable. The venue is massive and has all sorts of random decorations inside (including a parrot cage as you enter). Reminds me a bit of the \"Rainforest Cafe\" restaurants but a toned down version. 
The food is decent at best and for the price you pay, it's definitely worth it. There is an extensive salad bar, with 4 or 5 options of soup, 2 tables with mainly chinese options with the odd variant like tempura, chicken wings and cuts of meat, a meat station serving whatever meat is featured, a stir fry section (for satay's and more meat), pizza, desserts, after dessert bites basically the works! 

I generally stick to the Chinese food available in the buffet as opposed to more westernized cuts of meat and things like pizza. They have a small sushi bar, but I generally stay away from it as well just because there are so many other options and the sushi is also not that spectacular. 

Dessert options are nice as well, with a nice mix of \"typical\" cakes and puddings you would find at a buffet like this with a few interesting asian deserts you don't see all the time. 

The staff are always very friendly, and although I've never ordered from the bar, the drink menu looks promising."}
{"text":"It's been well over 10 years since I've been to Mandarin. I think the last time I went to one was when I was in high school and they had their lunch buffet for less than $10/person. But it had definitely changed in the last 5-10 years. Lunch is now $16.99 during the week and 20.99 on weekends. Dinner however is 31.99/person and $1 extra for this particular location. Buffet prices seem to be the same everywhere now whether it's Chinese or Japanese. Even though it was a bit pricey, I'd have to say it was worth every dollar. Mandarin standards have increased and the quality of their food and service was excellent. Our party of 7 was easily able to make a reservation for dinner on Friday. The moment we walked in till leaving the restaurant, we received great service. To top it off, I really liked the variety of dishes. Everything was fresh and tasty. We came at the right time because it was their Chinese New Year special featuring dumplings and an assortment of special dishes for the occasion. My fave was the lotus sticky rice and the fresh dumplings. Not to mention, the appearance of this location both inside and out was beautiful! Was really impressed by the light display outside the restaurant. I mean they gotta impress since it's the head office."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a buffet experience, you HAVE to visit this Mandarin location. There's a large selection to choose from and you can definitely over-eat. Come during the moon festival and you can get Peking duck (actually I'm not sure if this is the only time the have it available - I've only been here in October). 

The staff (holy crap are they nice) and the ambiance (there's an aquarium!) is what sets this location apart from others. At the time of this review, this has 4.5/5 stars on tripadvisor and rated #3 restaurant in Brampton. 

On our most recent visit, we got here around 6 om a Friday the food was almost at peak freshness. Come with an appetite and an empty stomach and you won't be disappointed. 

Here's a tip: make sure you keep your plates small so your food doesn't get cold while you work your way through. The hotter, the better!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with friendly staff!  A huge selection of buffet food to choose from.  A little pricy but worth it to go every so often.  The decor is amazing inside and out.  Take your camera."}
{"text":"Had a great time with old and new friends. Said it would be thirty minutes but 10 minutes later they were ready to seat us Food was plentiful and good! I had salad shrimp and cuttlefish(very different but food). Then a plate of sushi that would have cost me about the same as the cost of the buffet. Overall very good experience ."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this restaurant and they did not disappoint. Everything I tried either met or exceeded my expectations.  Recognizing this is a Chinese buffet style it is the best I have been to.  None of my Beijing friends will say it is authentic but that is not my expectation. The offering of non-Chinese foods was a surprise but I did not sample them, especially the featured Mexican offering, coming from Colorado I am not sure about it. 

The ice cream bar had black cherry. That was sufficient to sell me but the rest was also very good."}
{"text":"Two important points to understand about this review: 1-I am not a fan of buffets. I rarely eat more than one average-sized plate of food, which makes them rather a waste. 2-I did not pay for this meal. I was with a group from work, so I can't really speak to the value for the money. That being said  . . . 

We had about a 20-minute wait at about 7 pm on a Tuesday for our party of 8. They had predicted it would be a bit more, so it was a nice surprise to be seated early. Our table staff took care of drink orders, warm hand towels, refilling water and clearing plates. He was pleasant and efficient, and able to answer all our questions. We peeked into the famous Fish Room, which did look cool with its giant tank. We were seated in another room.

As for the food: There is a good selection of Asian and other favorites. The food is all presented nicely, and for the number of people in there, traffic is handled well. Everything seemed to be clean and well maintained. The sushi section is fairly small, but the pieces I tried were fine for a buffet. If there are rolls, I'd stick to those, as they are harder to mess up and you don't have to rely on having the absolute best cut of fish. I had mostly vegetarian selections, like sauteed beans, veggies in garlic sauce, salads and some noodles. All were good. My favorite dish was a spicy Thai eggplant. The flavor was delicious. I didn't have one, but the \"wrap\" cart looked interesting. Others in the group really liked the Chinese style chicken, something like a General Tso's. 

The dessert area was expansive, with a little bit of everything. The toasted marshmallows were a big hit, as was the mini creme brulee and the flan. The ice cream bar, of course, had to be visited as well."}
{"text":"Took my mom here for her birthday, and I can say I am very impressed. The architecture of the building is quite stunning, and I'm only talking about the outside. From the inside, it is no less stunning. It was like walking into a restaurant from another city. We made reservations just to be sure we wouldn't be waiting around. (I always suggest making reservations ;)) We were greeted by the host and by other waiters/waitress' walking in. We got warm towels and was able to freshen ourselves before our meal. The buffet offers a great selection of different kinds of foods. 
The cons: the peking duck station isn't make it yourself, there is a lady there making it. This may also be a pro, considering other people may not know how to eat this. They did not have a big sushi selection. (sashimi and yummy dragon rolls?) 
The pros outweigh the cons for me. More people started bustling in and more birthdays were being celebrated and it was very cute to see them sing and announce their birthdays to everyone. They never rushed us or made us uncomfortable. They have a gorgeous giant fish tank and there was a scuba diver inside feeding/cleaning the tank which was very cool. As we were on our way out we decided to take a picture and got one of the waiters to help, he also offered to print out our picture too! Now that is going above and beyond for me. It wasn't a big deal but it definitely made it more memorable to have a picture to take home with us! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Everything was tasty, very good, hot and fresh. Many many choices. Ambiance and personnel extra. Recommend without hesitation. 
Ps: we were party of 25 without reservation. They accommodated easily. Bravo."}
{"text":"Ordered take out the worst food ever. Very disappointing don't waste you money everything we ordered was very plain"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mandarin location in the GTA based on the 5 different locations I've visited. Warning 1: They are an extremely busy location so reservations are highly recommended. Warning 2: This review contains no pictures because I am always too busy stuffing my face. 

Savoury tips:
- Visit the sushi bar: Their sashimi is so fresh and tasty! Quite impressive, really. 
- Skip the prime rib: It always looks good but never pans out. Don't even bother.
- Crab legs: Delicious - don't be concerned if they've run out as they are diligently refilled. 
- Pizza: Surprisingly very tasty pizza here. Appreciate the small slices. 
- Gyoza: Make sure to dip in chili sauce (to the right of the grill station) 
- Fried chicken wings: Very flavourful and crispy. Add their teriyaki sauce by the grill station to get yourself some tasty teriyaki wings! 

Sweet tips:
- Mini pecan tarts: Yummy! 
- Creme brulee: Tastes like pure heavenly heavy cream.
- Flan: Deliciously eggy with the perfect amount of caramel flavour. 
- Chocolate covered strawberries: Simple yet delicious. 

Their service is great as well. They are friendly and always on top of clearing dirty plates. 

Currently $32.99 per adult on the weekend."}
{"text":"Food is ok, to be fair it's mandarin so it's the mcdonalds of Chinese food. The atmosphere is pretty tacky and looks like it hasn't changed since the mid 2000s. Music and overalls look is pretty forgettable. As for the service ... look this sounds like a idiotic thing to complain about but they were TOO nice, like creepy uncle your parents don't let you stay alone with for too long nice. Over all it was pretty good and what I expect from a franchise buffet restaurant."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favourite restaurant.  Specifically this location out of all the GTA Mandarins was the best especially with their crab legs.  I'm very sad to say that's no longer the case.  It's dropped from my top recommended restaurant to last.  First of all, they no longer serve crab legs, cold or hot.   They reduced the price by approx $2, which is a laugh.  If you're not a meat eater, you're paying $30+tax+tip for basically rice & noodles.  If you are a meat eater, get ready for some salt! Wow, they put a lot! Lastly, the service was sub par, as the dishes were continually building up and getting a water refill was a chore.   If this was the best location, I cant imagine how much worse the others have become.  My guess is they have changed ownership or management.  Will not return and definitely would not recommend!"}
{"text":"This is probably my third time to this manderin location not far from where I live..First like most manderins the hospitality is top notch when welcoming people.. Food wise it's always fresh lots to choose from especially on weekends, but you'll pay for that which includes seafood.. 
I came for lunch at half the price and there was plenty to choose from salad bar, main courses to desert all there.. 
Not sure why Brampton always charges an extra $1 per person tho.."}
{"text":"I came here with my younger brothers family n my family for dinner. Very nice place with amazing variety of main dishes and deserts. Very friendly with kids too."}
{"text":"Honestly, Mandarin is not on the top of my list for buffets anymore, as well as restaurants in general, but being in Brampton at dinner time with 2 little ones, this is probably the best place for it.  The decor is very nice and the fishes are always a favorite.  Service here has always been good here.  Plenty of people greeting you and opening the doors for you.  Very friendly here. A Manager usually walks around, check in with the tables and leave a business card.  

Food choices have generally been the same as far as I can remember.  Other places might have more selections, but I will say their prime rib is terrific!  Totally exceeds my expectation for a buffet.   I don't find the sushi selections that great, but at least they do not pack on the rice.   If anything, I would prefer coming here for lunch as I find price is fair, not so much dinner.  2 adults and 2 under 2  came to over $70 + tips.  

Got here early and it was fairly quiet, but then it started getting busy around 6.  Including a group of 30+ kids, so they slowed things down quite a bit.   Should come here earlier or at least make a recommendation as it does get busy."}
{"text":"It's Mandarin, what can I say.

Here it is in point form
- MAKE REZIES. the wait is long. Came here on a Friday night for dinner, on our way back from London. Waited about 30 min - not too bad but still, shoulda made a reservation when we were passing Waterloo...
- Crab legs! Yas.
- Very clean.
- Fresh food being brought out every 5-10 minutes, even 1 hour before closing.
- Desert selection is superb.
- Expensive - $30 bucks for friday night buffet but hey...it's worth it!
- Service is excellent - like 2 waiters for each eater. 
- Don't fill up on sh*t like potatoes - eat that stuff at home! GO BIG!

I hate the tiny ribs... I don't know what they're called, they are covered in red sauce. Just disgusting, not this place only - all the Mandarins I have been to. Look promising and exciting but do not deliver. The Justin Biebers of buffet world. 

I have to note that this is probably the most exciting Mandarin I have ever been to. You can literally see the flashing lights from the highway. It's like being in Vegas - everything blinks and shines and flashes, it's like Christmas!!! Very cool."}
{"text":"Make reservations a day a head of time and bring your conformation number or be prepared to wait.

This place is huge and they way they have it set up even if it is packed full (which it usually is) you don't notice because the design is brilliant! 

Love the food and the variety. My favorite is the not fish sushi roll station. Spring roll sushi rolls are a stroke of genius! The deserts are to die for. One more yummy then the next. A perfect place to bring a picky eater.

The bathroom has a baby changing table. Actually I think they have more then one."}
{"text":"By far the best buffet I have been to. Definitely worth the wait. Not been to a lot of buffets because I don't fancy them but the variety at this restaurant is unbelievable. The food is tasty and very yummy. Great for large Parties and family events.

Had an awesome time at this location and if I ever visit Canada again I will most definitely stop by. 5 Stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Mandarin is my favourite buffet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!its amazing every time we go!The food is simple but awesome food best dessert I've ever had and very nice people working there!And that's not just with this one!!!!!
It has awesome stuff in every mandarin!!!!!Thats why give it five stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"went for lunch. This restaurant is clean and decor or really nice. Food quality and food selection was really not up to the standard."}
{"text":"Best and biggest Chinese Buffet restaurant I've been to, and will continue to enjoy.  The selection is overwhelming:  over 150 items or dishes to choose from.  

Prime rib and Yorkshire pudding station and all usual sides.  A grilled meat station.  Chinese dumplings and choice of three sauces.  Pizza. Sushi station.  Two soups with crackers and bread choices.  Two looong tables of cold salads, vegetables, pickles/olives, fruits, cheeses, fish and shrimps/prawns.  Two loooong tables of Chinese and Canadian hot dishes.  

For dessert:  a hard ice cream station and soft serve frozen yogurt station.  And the best part . . . two looong stations of \"French\" and Chinese pastries, including fresh cut fruit, cakes, pies, cheesecakes, creme brûlée, chocolate fixes, puddings, squares, cookies and even jello.

That's all I can remember.  It's quite a good \"pig out\".

Crab legs are featured on the weekend (prices higher then too).

I've been going to Mandarin since it first opened as a restaurant on Queen Street in Brampton, and then as the first buffet 
 further down the street, and now the grand buffet restaurant here in south Bramalea, with its theme rooms.

It's perfect for out of town guests or newbies, as everyone can find something to their liking.  It's not just Chinese-Canadian food.

What it does over other buffets of the same type is that it has higher quality and care, plus turnover, so the food has better potential for freshness, taste and/or crispness.

Oh sure, the sushi doesn't contain fish or seafood, and the prawns are previously frozen and have a sulphite taste because they have been treated, but that's normal, and most people won't notice or care anyways.  I don't.  

Service is brisk, and overly welcoming, in Cantonese, English or Mandarin."}
{"text":"I ate at this place many times. It's an eye dazzler. Vegas style shock and awe is the main attraction. Once you peel the glitz off, the food is your average Chinese fair, may be a little better. The buffet line up doesn't change at all, gets old by third or the fourth visit."}
{"text":"This was a completely random find that we'd never forget.

I was with my best friend who was feeling pretty damn low at the end of our vacation. We were staying at a hotel nearby & I decided the best thing to cheer him up was with a local buffet. Cue in Mandarin. This place was not only beautiful with their indoor waterfall, floral displays, & themed rooms but almost everything we ate was both delicious & fresh. We went several times for food to only be disappointed that we couldn't eat more!

That wasn't the best part
Our server, cutest brunette ever, is truly what made our meal one to remember. She was super nice & attentive. Friendly & funny as if we were already friends. And came to sing my best friend happy birthday (it was not his birthday), give us a free cake, & take our commemorative photo (before taking an awesome photo with us!) which cheered him right up before we ran off for our flight. I really wish I remembered her name & most likely doesn't even work there anymore but I've never had service make such a difference to an already nice establishment. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"I took some family who were visiting from out of town here and they loved it. Service here is always good, servers very friendly and always around when you need them.

In terms of selection, they have a wide variety of things but I've been to other buffet places with more selection. The quality here is better than what you would find at most buffet places however.

Good selection of ice cream too if you like having dessert. I would try this place if you are looking for a decent buffet place with consistent service."}
{"text":"We have been to 4 Mandarin's till now.... This is the best Mandarin we've been in GTA!! 

The overall look is very impressive, nice place to give treats to friends or family.
The staffs are very courteous and polite, with great service.
The food selection is great... almost everyone will find a good range of appetizing foods  suitable to their taste buds. 

The place is quite big (actually huge)... but very busy and almost full most of times.
I have been there few times, and looking forward to go there many more times again  :-D"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Mandarin, so naturally besides commercials I've seen I didn't really know what to expect. I'll break this review down into categories to potentially make it easier for those of haven't gone before either. 

First Impressions:
When I walked in I was greeting by a massive entrance with extremely high ceilings and a little pond filled with fish. In summary a very nice entrance and probably one of the better ones (buffet exclusive) I've seen. I should add that all Buffets generally have the same type of open concept entrance opposed to traditional restaurants. Therefore my impressions are based on me comparing other Buffets to this place. 

Service:
Since we went on a Saturday naturally we had to wait (20 minutes). The hostess took our name and we took a seat and had some free popcorn while we waited; this can prove to be dangerous as it can fill you up. Anyways when our turn came, we had a server come and introduce himself, he asked who put there name down and gave that person an \"extra special\" greeting which was very very odd to me. As this was my first time the server showed us around and told us where the various food stations were. As we walked to our table we must have been passed over to several severs (5 to be exact). They each walked us to a certain distance while another one then took over, this is very cool but also once again very very odd; to me at least. Once we were finally seated we were given water and we made our way to get food.

The food:
The reason why the review is very poor is due to the very bad food I had during my visit. Most of the food is extremely tasteless or is so salty you think your Cholesterol will spike if you take another bite. The only thing I could stand to eat was the dumplings as they had a certain amount  of tastelessness that I could handle. When it was time to grab dessert the majority of my calories came from there as I couldn't stand the food at all.  Even though the majority of my dessert was okay they still managed to put an unthawed cake out, I subconsciously took it and was greeted by chunks of ice in my mouth. 

Final thoughts:
Now this may seem a little far fetched but as I sat there I noticed how \"stereotypical\" this restaurant is. Whatever you perceive to be related to Asian/Chinese culture is here (Decor, Pandas, Colourful Umbrellas, Music, and Dragons), it was so apparent that is was offensive. Even though I'm not Chinese I felt insulted for them. 
Asides from that the service is top-notch but the food isn't."}
{"text":"I've been to many a Chinese buffet..but the one that usually remember the most is the Mandarin Chinese buffet in Canada.  This was the first buffet restaurant that I had ever gone to (when I was a child) and this is the brand that I usually associate most Chinese buffet to. The Mandarin chain of restaurants has been around since 1979 so it the first of its kind in Canada  The this location in Brampton, is supposedly the largest and the corporate headquarters to all the Mandarin locations.  

My wife and I decided to go to the Mandarin for my birthday dinner, this was because of the free dinner promotion on your birthday that it had become known for.  Since I hadn't been here in a couple of years, I thought it would be a good location to rediscover.  The complex is located in the industrial district along Steeles and 410 and can be a little difficult to find if you don't pay attention to the signs.  This location is different that other locations as it houses the corporate HQ and a conference center along with the restaurant.  You get the impression that the restaurant is the size of the building (which is quite large), but it only occupies 1/3 of the building (a little disappointing).   We were greeted quickly and I told them it was my birthday and asked if I get my complementary dinner..the host smiled blankly and wrote on our bill B-Day in red pen along the top of our bill and said the host will show us to our table.  The hostess was quite nice as she mentioned all the buffet tables and stations along with her choices of top dishes to be had.  We were seated in Room C along with what we found out was almost all the tables were celebrating birthdays (more on that later).  We were greeted by our server duo who was tending to the tables in Room C very quickly and took our drink orders.  After our greeting and order taking we were on our way to the buffet.  The selection was extensive and diverse, food ranged from Prime Rib, Mexican, Japanese, Chinese, Pizza, etc...

  The quality of the food was not spectacular or bad..it was just buffet quality.  Most food that sits under a heat lamp for a number of minutes tends to lose a lot of quality.  My wife and I went back a couple of times for different items and it was alright.  Our servers kept the table bussed and our waters full.  At the end of our meal, our servers brought out a Chinese hat and sang the Mandarin \"Happy Birthday\" song along with a cake and a free picture.  This practice was fun when it was your turn..but in our area there must have been 15 birthday dinners, during our meal and by the time they came to my table I sang along wit the servers. It was a little annoying during our dinner as we were trying to have a conversation. We asked for the bill and it was quickly given.  The surprise was that the \"complementary\" birthday buffet was not complementary at all and 2 full price dinner buffets were charged.    I asked our server about this and she smiled blankly and said \"You need a coupon\".... \"A coupon?\" I asked.. She walked away and I had to look it up online.  As I searched on the Mandarin website, I found that Mandarin does give a free birthday buffet...if you sign up for the email club.  It was my mistake for not looking up this online before, but from previous experiences at the Mandarin..you show up...show your id on your birthday...get a free buffet.  There are other Chinese buffets in the area that offer this promotion and you just show your id...and voila.  In retrospect, I wish the hostess at the front would have informed us of the new policy of signing up for the email club to get the complementary buffet before we sat and our servers in our section would have asked if we had our coupon (which they didn't)..All in all the Mandarin experience was like a remember and not like I remembered...it was good...and not so good...3 stars"}
{"text":"I have to say that the chinese buffets in states do not compare to our neighbors up in canada, at least the ones that I have been to. 

The decor inside and outside is very nice. They take pride in their decor and also in how they present the food. Very neat and clean. There are different rooms to be seated in, one with an aquarium and another with birds. We were seated in the bird room and it was cute to see the birds playing with one another. 

Before and after your meal, they give you hot towels to wipe your hands which i thought was a nice touch! The food is your typical chinese food, american/asian offerings and plenty of dessert. The staff is attentive and polite as well. Be sure to sign up with their website because you can get a free coupon for your birthday. They also take a picture of you with a canadian cowboy hat if you are celebrating, the picture is put on a magnet holder for you to keep at no charge. Very cute!

Good prices and if you come senior citizens, its 20% for them!"}
{"text":"Was here for a group dinner as this is one of the favourite restaurant of a manager in which I work with.  We were a large group (nearly 20) and not everyone seems the most enthusiastic about the Mandarin.  

The good:  Huge selection of pretty much anything you desire to eat.

The bad:  Lots of unhealthy fried food with smaller selection of vegetables and bigger selection of the stuff that will expand your waistline ten fold.  

I tried the sushi as a starter.  Last time I ate here (probably 5 years ago) the sushi was  pretty bland and sub standard quality.  I was somewhat surprised that the quality was better but the selection was pretty much \"beginner sushi\".  Next plate was a mix of some noodles, fried food and veg.  Food has flavour but seems a bit more bland when it's on a buffet to me.  

This place is clean and if Asian buffets are your deal then serve it up!   

For me it's just a so-so!"}
{"text":"Ive been going to mandarin since I can remember, although I've heard many a horrible story about food poisoning, I personally have never really had one. This particular mandarin I have been visiting since I was a child and I will say it hasn't  changed much in all the years I've been visiting. I believe this is their flagship location, and head office as well... They also have a private event area as well as decorations from roof to ceiling with a ton of decorative Christmas lights.

This is the location with a large water feature and several large aquariums situated in large rooms. A huge private parking lot makes parking pretty easy but finding the place can be a tad tricky. It's clearly visible from the highway but to find the place you need to take the odd side street. 

Once you find the place you will see the service is like most mandarins you encounter, the facade of customer service I find a tad annoying... Once I am inside the restaurant and have been greeted I find it a tad awkward to interact with every single staff member on my way to my table.  Once you get past that you'll notice the tables are fairly spacious but like most restaurants jammed together to add more seating.

Now this particular visit was for a bday party for my bestie and although it had all been meticulously planned and organized the staff found the entire concept slightly confusing, giving away the surprise to any guest including the bday girl in the end.
Service is the usual as I've said however it may be due to the large location but I found the maintenance of tables a little slacking however staff seems polite and eager to help.

The food is again nothing exceptional, I find that once you've frequented mandarin you not only know what to expect but nothing exceeds those expectations. They have the usual spread of food available and although the rest of my table seemed to love the crab legs I wasn't thrilled; the cold crab had a murky, watery taste while the hot crab was prob overcooked making it pretty hard to get out of the shell, especially in one piece. The drinks are where they really hit your pocket though, a simple watered down mixed drink is over $7 here and the little table adds they have to advertise the drinks doesn't specify price either which is a tactic I'm not fond of.

They also close fairly early (9pm) considering they only really start accepting at 6pm so because the bday girl was a few minutes late the event was actually quite rushed as her cake was dumped at the table with bills mere minutes after she had her first plate on the table.

Which leads me to my last point and among the most vital ones... maybe it's the head office location but I could have sworn the price was around $26-$30 a person however when my boyfriend and I received our bill it was well over $80 and all we had was the buffet, one mixed drink and an orange juice. I used to be a reg at a few other locations and I don't ever remember it being that expensive, at that rate you can go to a decent restaurant and eat well. 

Personally I would rather go to red lobster for delicious crab and lobster for a similar price if not even less. In closing I feel like mandarin needs to step up a bit if they intend on charging that amount and considering how dated they are I think it's about time"}
{"text":"This is by far the most impressive Chinese Buffet that I've ever seen. It had multiple selections & seeing is how today is Chinese New Year the service was over the top excellent! 

There were hot towels to wash your hands/face with both before AND after the meal. There were lots of polite young people that were overly enthusiastic but were ready to serve. 

The buffet itself's food quality was not particularly high (lots of fried stuff-which I cannot resist) but one cannot deny the freshness of the food itself. It all seemed well prepared & presented. The main service area had 4-6 food stations + 2 separate dessert station & an ice cream station. All in all a solid dining experience that I will do again."}
{"text":"What's up, Canada?  Do you Yelp*?  I can't believe only 15 reviews total.

Short review for me here because there was nothing at all bad about my visit.

I was greeted personally and promptly and exchanged names with the greeter who also gave me a brief tour (rather large place).  The same for my server.  I felt welcomed, valued, and respected.

The food selection was very beautifully presented and varied.  Far better than any similar buffets I've seen in my area.

I enjoyed everything I chose to eat.

The price was very reasonable for the selection and quality.  If I ever get back to Brampton, I'll be at Mandarin for dinner, for sure!"}
{"text":"If you really need to read a review on Mandarin, I'm kinda worried for you. Mandarin is the most popular and overpriced \"meh\" buffet restaurant known to mankind. The only thing really enjoyable there is the salad bar. I will however say this is one of the less bad locations, if not ONLY one."}
{"text":"Now that they have put all other buffets out of business Mandarin is everyone's favourite.
The name sounds Chinese and they are known as a Chinese buffet, but frankly they have transformed into an Asian/Canadian buffet. The fare ranges from Thai skewers to those fake sushi rolls that Chinese people make to Chinese-Canadian Chicken Balls to pizza to mussels and shrimp to Italian desserts and so on and on..
Buffets are an embarrassment and I normally do not go unless invited or part of group, but at least Mandarin does it right. It is $25/person for lunch including all the extras. 
The ambiance is amusing and it is clear they have worked on it hard with the pandas, the waterfall, the umbrellas and the poor poor carp fish in the water.
The huge restaurant is clean and unlike other 'Chinese' restaurants so are the washrooms. They do need more stalls and space in their washrooms however. 1,000 people and four washroom stalls creates a bottleneck.
It is clear that people gravitate to this place on their birthdays. It is tiresome and sad to see, but to each his own.
The staff are polite and courteous and there is a high level of service present despite being a mass market business. Kudos to the employees and the management.

One last thing: I have to admit that the food here had some taste. Anyone who has ever visited a Mandarin knows that every dish and tray and food and offering and menu item tastes exactly the same. The ice cream tastes like the chicken tastes like the mussels tastes like the noodle tastes like pork tastes like the cookies.... I have speculated this is because they go out of their way to make their foods as average and bland as possible to satisfy everyone and that they cook the food and place it in hot water to keep warm so it is ready to go. I do have to admit that at this location there was indeed a couple of food items with a modicum of taste."}
{"text":"The ambiance is fantastic and the food is better then normal buffet. Definitely would come back

Thanks"}
{"text":"This Mandarin is by far my favorite.  Its good to come here roughly 2-3/yr and still see the same staff.  It shows that they must treat their employees good.

With that said... moving on to the review.

Plenty of parking... and the decorations outside and inside is always tastefully done according to season or special events.

If you did not make a reservation, expect to wait a bit during 6-7pm.  I have noticed walk ins during this time are yold wait times to be 1.5 to 2hrs.  I dont know why they say this as most would leave.  Lost business!!!
Those that do stay... usually get seated within 30mins for up to a party of 4.

The food is always replenished when tray is low... so diners never go without an option.  

NOTE to diners... move over while the employee is filling a tray up and cleaning the area up.  They are just doing their job!  
RELAX!!!  the food is going nowhere!

Their sushi bar is ok... if you request for a specialty roll (due to allergic/ health reasons) request for a roll to be made for you.  

NOTE: if you want smoke salmon only... ask for it.... they will get some to put on your plate.

I am not a big dessert person.. i do think they could change up their desserts. I have seen the same assortments for over 10yrs now with very minimal updates.

If you are not seated in the BIG fish room... make sure you take a look.  Beautiful ocean life captured. 
I do feel sorry for the diners that are seated right by the observation tank... as there can be lots of diners and kids running around.

In all the years there celebrating with family and friends... I have only had one bad dining experience due to a very unprofessional waiter.  The manager on duty did address the issue right away."}
{"text":"You know its funny. 

I really like the Mandarin for one reason CRAB LEGS!!!!! I dive face first in them like every straight man would Kim Kardasian's rear end. 

The mandarin in Brampton (flagship) store is very clean and the service is great. 

The washrooms are clean but i saw some dude puke in the sink and then sift through it like he was looking for buried treasure. 

Twisted."}
{"text":"Mandarin is the only Chinese Buffet that I will have no problem going to - considering that the only AYCE I love to go to are for sushi purposes only lol! Superb service, right when you enter and leave you will feel welcomed by the hostesses and servers. The manager even went and introduced himself to all the tables (at least in the room I was seated in), and handed out his card. This was a really good gesture, and honestly I was a bit taken back by how friendly and outgoing the staff is here. 

Great food selection, and although the dessert options are not as huge as Spoonful's, it is still great quality and much more delicious. Everything tasted fresh on all three trips, and every trip all the food was restocked and fresh which is very much appreciated considering that it was pretty busy for a Wednesday night. 

Decor is also a nice touch - this is probably the nicest and largest Mandarin I've been too! The waterfall is really nice, and you can actually sit beside it. Perfect date spot... if you plan to take your date to Mandarin ahaha.

I definitely recommend this location of Mandarin! Amazing service and quality - you will not be disappointed :))"}
{"text":"I was dragged here for a business lunch as one of my colleagues couldn't stop talking about how wonderful this place was and my leader took her advice at face value.  Now seeing how this same lovely lady also thinks Moxie is great for bringing your in-laws for fine dining, I was suspecting her choice in restaurant was not great... if anything it should be taken with a grain of salt.  Speaking of salt, Mandarin is full of it... salt that is.  

I'll be honest and say, the service was so damn personable and friendly that I was taken aback and feared the hostess would hug me.  It completely threw me off.  Kudos to them for having a great staff that actually makes you feel welcomed as an individual instead of another way to pay their wage.  

As for the restaurant, the room we were seated in was the 'tropical' room.  Each giant dining section has a theme and ours felt like an explosion of PJ Pet Store and a McDonald children's play area.  The bright colours in addition to the large windowed parrot viewing made for an assault on your eyes.  As noted by one of my other colleagues, it was not pleasant to be eating while having a giant parrot take a poop.  It's a good thing I missed that event.

The buffet area is fairly big and well maintained.  Considering how large the actual restaurant is, I was thinking the buffet would actually be bigger.  There is something for everyone at this buffet.  They had a fresh veggie and salad selection.  Vegetables were all fresh and the selection wasn't too bad and it also had some cold mussels as well in this area.  The entree area is filled with a lot of Chinese Canadian items (chicken balls anyone?) and some fast food items (French Fries...?).  The 'authentic' Chinese dishes were clearly made with the North American palate in mind and to be fair, that's fine for this audience.  Other than soy sauce, there's really no other Chinese condiment used.  No Chinese 5 spice, ginger, black bean sauce, oyster sauce, or hoisen sauce in sight.  They had the usual fare and it wasn't all bad.  

Lemon chicken wasn't cloying or overly battered.  The broccoli and stir fried beef tasty enough and not over cooked.  They had broiled salmon and that was good as it moist and not overcooked.  They also had a 'sushi' station but it only had california roll, avocado roll, and tempura shrimp roll.  They had a grilled area which served items similar to a teriyaki preparation.  Oddly enough, they had a pizza station here but it really appealed to the kids.  The dessert area was split into two parts.  One was the plated cakes, fruits, assorted pastries, and ice cream.  The other place was freshly made waffles and cookies.  None of it seemed Asian except for the Mango pudding and the odd lychee in the fruit salad.  They had flan, fake cannoli, butter cookies, chocolate mousse cake, and varieties of other sweet items.  Personally, I didn't like it but that didn't stop me from trying everything once!  

Overall, the buffet is as large as this review but hopefully my review was more satisfying than the meal itself.  Mandarin is meant for a North American audience and they achieved it very well.  As for someone who is Asian and wants a true Asian buffet, I recommend to trek to Markham for that experience."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant from top to bottom. This is the best Mandarin certainly in the GTA area and I have been to many of them! They also have an amazing selection of dishes. Grilled pineapple!!

This will be our family's Mandarin for many years to come."}
{"text":"Who doesnt love Mandarin? Large variety of goodies from ribs and roast beef to sushi to Asian-American style and some authentic chinese style, you wont have problems finding something youll like. Dessert variety is really good, and the atmosphere is just purely stunning. Unlike the other buffets with amazing decor with subpar food, Mandarin did not forget the quality of its food. Service is also friendly."}
{"text":"Still one of my fave spots for Chinese buffet. I recently visited this place again with my family and I stick to my original review. Still a great place, clean, professional, and always busy. 

This time I found that they had more seafood (shrimp) dishes in the main entree buffet. That was a plus!

LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Best location and food! I haven't came here in awhile, maybe I should go here today? Just leaving a review"}
{"text":"Huge food and dessert selection.  Service is always good.  Themed rooms are really nice"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, the reason I love this place is because of the themed rooms. The decor of the main entrances is amazing then you have the bird room, waterfall room and fish room. All three are gorgeous and make the experience that much better.

This is definitely the best location of all the Mandarin chains. Plenty of options, frequent replenishes and above average buffet food quality. I was also very impressed with the service as our waters were refilled literally every 10 minutes and we even had the manager come around to our table to make sure everything was going well. 

They also had a frozen yogurt machine alongside the usual ice cream with fruit toppings and jelly bellys. As if the kids weren't already loaded on sugar there was green apple cotton candy as we left. 

I'm impressed and will only attend this location in the future!"}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend and her parents for dinner on a week day. Sat down around 6:15 but when when our whole party arrived (6:30ish) we started to get it food... at that time there was a HUGE line up by the door. Luckily we missed that crowd and had reservations. 

The food was always stocked up and readily available. The honest fact of the matter is most of the chicken dishes (general tsos, spicy chicken, and one of which I forgot the name) were all basically the same with a different level of spice. Still good but not as differentiable as I'd prefer. 

The dessert area was LOADED with sweets in nice portions so no one would over do it by any means. Pastries, cakes, ice creams, and hot pies!

Staff was attentive, welcoming, and quick to bring new silver ware, straws, water, etc.

Summary: definitely worth the cost and worth trying."}
{"text":"If you like buffet, this is the place to go. This is the flagship restaurant of the Mandarin Restaurant chain and it is certainly one of the largest there is.  It is a great place for groups because there will be something for everyone there. It's much more than just chinese-style food, there is a meat carving station with prime rib and Yorkshire pudding, pizza, sushi (note that all of their sushi is cooked, although it is very good). Plenty of staff around to serve you and make sure that the dishes put out are kept fresh.

One recommendation if you are bringing a large group: put your reservations in well in advance, particularly during the holiday season as they tend to book up quickly"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a buffet. I have had better but l enjoyed it and it's selection. I went after the crab legs which were great for a buffet."}
{"text":"My favourite Chinese buffet! I remember the first time I went there to eat. I was amazed with the decor and the live animals in each room (I still am lol). Then the food, oooh the food! The lemon chicken is superb, the sushi selection is good, the dessert table is crazy, but the garlic broccoli is my favourite dish! I remember on one of my visits they had red velvet ice cream and I swear I could have eaten my body weight in it! Such a cool place, they make you wear a sombrero if it's your birthday and sing to you, they also take a picture and put it in a magnetic frame which makes for a cool keepsake! The only down side is the price. I only get to go once MAYBE twice a year on special occasions but I still love it! Definitely check it out if you haven't."}
{"text":"The Mandarin Restaurant sets a whole new standard for Chinese buffets! I felt like a kid in a candy store. The decor is whimsical and reminded me of the Bellagio in Vegas. Typically the quality of food suffers when there isn't a central cuisine but everything tasted great! The steak was tender, the chicken was juicy, the ice cream bar was delectable and the cotton candy stand on the way out was cute ;) 5-Stars all around for service, food quality & cleanliness."}
{"text":"out of the dozen times i've been to this location, i've learned quite a few things
10 times out of 12 they sit you in the bird room
1 time out of 12 they sit you in the fish room 
1 time out of 12 they sit you in the waterfall room(we reserved for over 12 people) 
a really good deal if you are a fan of simple and basic chinese foods, the fresh crab is a plus, even tho they get the really small stuff. 
mussles, clams, and shrimp are always a must(good bang for the buck) '
service is always good, sometimes they don't get the plate cleared off in time, but with the volume of food and people they pump in and out hourly...thats cool 
i've never not ate at the buffet, so i have no opinion on what the standard menu has to offer...or if it tastes different or not
NO CLUE"}
{"text":"Beautiful interior, exterior and decor! I ate here for the first time and loved everything they had to offer! Food is so fresh and very high quality. My personal favorite was the steak. The sausage was great too! 

The dessert selection is out of the this world! So much variety! Highly recommend trying to all! It was my mom's birthday so they sang for her and gave a dessert! Very kind!"}
