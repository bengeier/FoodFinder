{"text":"I had the spicy beef tripe soup with egg noodles. The noodles had a good bounce to them and broth was flavourfull. Chicken wings were crispy and spiced with chili and cumin. I would come back again."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan other their spices. Generally I have an issue with my clothes smelling like the establishment after my meal,  and this would also be one of  those places."}
{"text":"I had the Beef Brisket Noodle Soup. It was surprisingly good. Price was a bit on the steeper side for a takeout noodle soup, but nonetheless a great broth, good noodles and great meat. Would go there again!"}
{"text":"Good food court experience, rice combo with two extra, enough for a typical man. Food will be prepared for a quick time."}
{"text":"I really like the noodles here. I got the B2- beef brisket in soup. Egg noodles were perfectly chewy and bouncy, beef brisket was tender and soup was great. Just a note - the type of spicy served here is the numbing type so it may or may not be preferable to some people. The only thing I dislike was the price - not sure why everything in this food court is relatively high compared to other food courts. Also the food court design is quite strange - garbage bins are not made for food court usage and you have to give the trays back to the store. Service was alright but a little bit slow even though there was three people in the booth. Since the price here is the same as a restaurant, there's no real reason to eat here compared to the other selections in North York unless it hits a craving."}
