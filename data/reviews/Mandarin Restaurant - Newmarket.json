{"text":"The crème brûlée was cold, old and 'cheesy'. But dinner selection was nice, there's a frozen yogurt machine (a new thing to me when being in Mandarin). As someone from south East Asian origin, it was refreshing and reassuring to see a smiling blond-haired, blue-eyed waitress."}
{"text":"We have gone to a Mandarin many times but I have to say that it has really gone downhill.  They are charging  $32.99 for an adult but last time I was there, I got $7.00 worth of food.  They couldn't keep up with the amount of people so a lot of the dishes were empty and took some time to refill.  The food quality is also getting worse.  Definitely not worth the money.  They servers are very pleasant, which is about the only positive thing I can say."}
{"text":"I went here for my sister's birthday, and it really went downhill. The first time we enjoyed our experience, however this time it was horrible! The food is high in sodium, and I think the baked potatoes were the worst out of all; it felt like I was eating salt, just plain salt. Though, the costumer service was good so I'll give 2 stars for the good service, but crappy food."}
{"text":"I've gotten both the buffet and take-out from this place before, and it's always delicious. Definitely recommend going there."}
{"text":"It is one of our favorite restaurant. Good foods, good services, nice and clean. Price a bit high though. The con is the waiting time to be seated as its always crowded. I am not sure if they take reservations for just 2 or 3 people."}
{"text":"Your first experience of this place is that you love it. But after a while you tend to get bored and tired of the food. I am not saying it is a bad buffet its great! But I would say that Mandarin is one of those restaurants that is just very well known for the name and if you spend a bit more time researching you will find better. For example Wasabi or my favourite: Wok of Fame."}
{"text":"The buffet is excellent, but really really expensive ! Especially on weekends ! The food is pretty good though, but does not seem to be worth the cad 25 (or 26?) on the weekends.."}
{"text":"We've only been there twice for birthdays.  We don't frequent all you can eat buffets often because, well,  we eat way too much.  Each time has been friendly, the foods been fresh and the enviroment is clean.  Fantastic for fussy eaters.  So much selection!"}
{"text":"Went to this location last night for a birthday.  Never again,  will know for next time to fake an injury.  Food is barely edible.  I couldn't distinguish one meat form another.  From bland to salty to odd looking sauces.  I didn't sleep well after this.  I may be a little scarred. Good news is there's lots of selection so you get to choose what food to make you cringe."}
{"text":"Am giving this 2 stars as i did not find the food of good quality. The honey salmon fishy, pepper beef like elastic. The dumplings were ok and not the highlight of the food. Old favs like shrimp, roast beef and hot and sour soup were. The desserts were hit or miss. Lemon cake nope, creme brule yeah! Each adult buffet mustve been 24$ and we certainly didnt eat all that much. Service was really good though."}
{"text":"I'm a senior. 20% off for lunch is great. Yes the selection is the same but, and there is always a but, the variety is so large that you can go once a week for a while and not really eat the same thing twice. Good value in my opinion. Not fine dining.  The dessert selection is second to none with bread pudding available. Did I mention that I love bread pudding. Try and get that at any other restaurant. It would take a month of Sundays to try everything here.  There pizza is terrible but hey this is a Chinese restaurant.  It's Thanksgiving and I'm going to try the dinner tomorrow. Turkey yes but I'm going to keep in mind this is a Chinese restaurant.  I'll let you know."}
{"text":"At first when this place opened in Newmarket, I was stocked! I mean it's like buffet heaven, pretty affordable, $11.99 for lunch during the week.  But then after a while, it gets pretty boring. They have the same foods for the past i dont even know how many years. A place of this size you would think would switch it up from time to time.  This location is super clean and service is great. It's definitely very americanized Chinese food. But still gets the job done. They have a salad bar and they have other non chinese food also, like mashed potatoes, meat and pizza.   The have a GREAT desert bar, to be honest Im usually excited to finish my food just to hit that up. They make fresh waffles, so I usually do the ice cream waffle ;)   I never go on weekends, especially for dinner and I dont recommend it only because its SO expensive, $25.99 a person. Ummm, I could go eat steak at the Keg for that price lol.    Besides that, it's great on the weekdays for a plurge lunch meal."}
{"text":"I went to the bathroom and I was fixing my makeup which took about 7-10 minutes. When the lady got there same time I did. Went into the stall for about 7-10 minutes than came out and left ... SHE WAS A WORKER WHO DIDNT WASH THEIR HANDS. This is a second time I've seen this. So disgusting. I emailed Mandarin they said thanks for letting us know. Like there going to do anything to fix it. Don't go there please I don't want anyone getting sick."}
{"text":"The Mandarin has got to be one of the best family restaurants ever when it comes to quality of food and customer service. I recommend the Newmarket location if you are in the area.   Pricing is fair however not cheap. Average price for Sunday brunch is around $20 per adult and kids are $13 for 12 and under."}
{"text":"I now understand why they sing happy birthday to people. I received a free dinner with a purchase of three other paying diners. When you cash in your free dinner with Mandren they will go up to you and sing the happy birthday song even if you are embarrassed To the BONE!!! And make your mother pretend that she is the birthday lady. she then wore the sombrero, had her picture taken.... even when we said we don't want to. I now understand.   On to the food. Food was good, not great but eh, c'mon... you know where you are so don't complain. I love the western Chinese food, to a point. The crab was the selling point for going at night on a Sunday! With the free dinner, price was lowered and tolerable. We actually used two free dinner vouchers and six of our party paid, out of eight people.   Will be back for the sombrero and birthday song .... just to get this free western Chinese dinner!"}
{"text":"Well I'm pretty sure most people have been to a Mandarin location in Ontario and have gorged on many of the items in it's buffet. I always wear my \"buffet eating pants\". Stretchy & loose. There's something for everyone; from beef, chicken, shrimps, pork, fish and weekend crab legs. I'm not going into the various styles of the items. Just know that some items are traditional & North Americanized. Prices are higher on the weekend as more seafood items are offered.  The buffet has a  \"appetizer/ starter section; a hot soups section;  a huge array of hot foods including western foods like roast beef; and of course desserts. When Mandarin first entered the market in the 80's it was the Best thing ever!  This location is clean and the staff is very good at keeping up on clearing the dishes and are very courteous. My only complaint is the food is not as good as some of the other locations. That's why I'm giving this place a 2.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"Review is for takeout only. It's pretty good, did not encounter any major issues. Some meat dishes are a little on the dry side sometimes, but considering the amounts they make them in, and the price for takeout - there is room for improvement but I'm not complaining. It is definitely very affordable American \"Asian\" food, great when on a random night you have no dinner and want to get something quick, something tasty. Or craving something different.."}
{"text":"Easily the best Mandarin around. Service is always excellent. Food is fresh but don't go for their last hour before they close. They start clearing the steam tables and you'll miss out.  The only problem is that the they no longer have hot crab legs on the weekend. This was the only reason why we go to the Mandarin, so unfortunately we're breaking up with them despite the good service. The weekend dinner price is just too much for what you get now."}
{"text":"Me and my husband came to this branch of Mandarin almost by accident. We were new to the region and were looking for places to have lunch around the area. I was feeling like having chinese food, so it looked appealing enough for a good lunch.  We didn't know, though, that it was all-you-can-eat buffet. This is not a downside since the food is good, especially for the price they charge (for 2 people, including drinks, tips and tax it was around $40). But I think it is not a place to go everyday -- I went there twice and the salad selection was pretty much the same. There are plenty of choices for desserts but most of them looks very pre-made and are not much tasty.  However, the service is nice and the place is clean. It's definitely a place you can go once a couple of months when you feel like eating a lot and not paying too much for that."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 5 stars because as far as Chinese style buffets go, this one is my favorite. ONLY THE NEWMARKET LOCATION! This one is new, clean, the food is always hot and fresh and the servers are a-plenty! Seriously, there is always one around...  Crab legs are obviously my fave. They're pre-chipped but I always bring sturdy scissors with me so I don't have to feel bad when I can't open that sucker up! The dinner price on weekends is 25.99.  I also love the make-shift shrimp tempura. It's a darker coating, thicker too and oh so greasy - droooolllzzz.  The sushi here is obviously not great, BUT they have some with smoked salmon which I love because come on now, it's smoked salmon (they're Philadelphia rolls, but there are other ones).  The desert table is great too - the best is the waffle. They make fresh waffles and I take it upon myself to pile on whipped cream, drizzle it with chocolate and put canned peaches and bananas on it (peaches are where the cold salad bar is, don't know why...). SOOOO GOOOODDDD!!  Excellent buffet. I have no complaints. It's not authentic Chinese food, it's not Japanese sushi - it's Mandarin. You still your face and then regret it. I feel like people have some kind of weird expectations when it comes to this place...you know what's you're going into!!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO MANDARIN, THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU AS A CUSTOMER OR KEEPING YOU AS A CUSTOMER.  IF I CAN GIVE THEM 0 STAR I WOULD  READ MY LETTER TO THEM AND READ WHAT THEY SAID (CORPORATE BS) THE LEAST THEY COULD HAVE DONE IS TO OFFER THE LITTLE GUY AND HIS FAMILY A NEW DINNER EXPERIENCE.    I have been a patron of the Newmarket restaurant form many years, today was the worse experience I have had there in many many years, the server Faye was pushy, rude, and impatient with my family. Only minutes into our meal, Faye asked if we wanted tea or coffee, we responded that we are still having the main course, soon after she rudely asked if our children will still have more desert, they have not even finished their dinner. We all felt that we are being pushed out when she asked if we needed our bill???? It was early, no one was in the restaurant yet, why are we being pushed out? Today was my eight year's birthday, we asked to have our picture taken and this was the final straw, she threw the birthday hat at us and rushed the picture. The picture came back with no frame and the picture showed our mood at the time. We asked where was the frame, she said there was no more, speak to the Manager. I spoke to the Manager, Angela and told her of the incident, she too did not offer anything. I would like someone from the head office to look into this and make it right. Regards, Dr. John Cheong    Dear Mr. Cheong,                  We would like to thank you for telling us of your experience with our restaurant on January 9, 2014.   We appreciate you bringing this matter to our attention.  We have addressed this issue with Mandarin Newmarket's management team.   On behalf of the management and staff of Mandarin Newmarket, we would like to extend you a sincere apology for the inconvenience and disappointment that this situation caused. Mandarin Newmarket will be ensure additional service training be done and apologize for any misunderstanding. Please be assured that our goal is to maintain and exceed customer expectations and we sincerely apologize for falling short of yours.     We take all customer feedback seriously and thank you again for bringing this matter to our attention.  Again, we extend our apologies and we look forward to serving you at our establishment again soon."}
{"text":"OMG!!! Sooo full!! We had the Chinese New Year special... Lots of crab legs and shrimp! Too bad I had a sketchy lobster, if I am sick tomorrow... I'll know why... Overall great efficient staff and yummy Canadianized buffet :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location and I was very surprised at the attitude of the staff.  Mid meal, my friend and I went put for a cigarette and told the ladies at the front. It was cool out (we were in summer dresses) and went to the car. The manager ran out with a few employees yelling that we are leaving and we didnt pay. We told them that we will be back after our smoke and we havent had dessert yet. They \"let\" us go but left an employee in the parking lot watching my car. When we came in the managers and a bunch of staff members were standing around waiting for us.  We had out dessert and coffee to unpleasant glances from all the staff members.  This was never an issue at any other location. I dont see why they made us feel like criminals when we did tell them that we are going out and coming right back.  I don't see why they thought we drove to Newmarket to dine and dash on a cheap buffet...  Their fish in the salmon sushi rolls tasted old and salty.  The cold crab legs were not replaced until they were all eaten. Ive never seen that happen before in a mandarin. The staff seemed to spend more time maintaining the dining tables that the actual buffet.  Really crap experience.  Definitely not going back to this location."}
{"text":"Will suffice to fill bellies in a pinch, but this location is definitely bellow standards of Mandarins in the 416 or the Woodbine location.   Perhaps it's a cynical view of upper-905ers as undemanding provincials who are content with the AYCE bang-for-buck and an array of multi-colored dishes?OK. I understand Mandarin is not gourmet cuisine, but it's usually pretty good for what it is, I'm just holding it to it's own standard.  On our group visit, the ribs & spareribs  fared the best, especially the Honey Garlic so tender even the bones could be eaten. The Green Beans sauteed in garlic & chili was also very good as was the Spicy Chicken.  Old war horses like Lo Mein, Shanghai Noodles, Lemon Chicken & General Tso  & Tepanyaki chicken were tolerable, though you could do better at a Mom & Pop shop at any Asian mall or supermarket. Black pepper Steak, Curry Chicken & Spicy Noodles were a total fail even with low expectations.  But the worst stuff was the BBQ counter. In other Mandarins the meat samplers from the grill are very high quality meat - I'd say better than places like Milestones, Montana & Pickle Barrel - but here the steak was a dry, rubbery choke hazard and the Chicken wasn't much better. Prime rib was OK and sausage was decent although dry and maybe a little old. So for those who didn't like the Wok offerings, only the Prime Rib, Crab Legs & Garlic Bread were safe - as long as you didn't add the chili sauce which was horribly sour and stale (think Ajvar cut with vinager & tonic water)   I didn't notice any of the service problems others have mentioned. If anything I'd say the staff was above average in terms of friendliness and body language, I think because it's smaller and less busy than a Mandarin in Toronto there is not as much stress & pressure on the them, it's a nicer vibe.  But that's a small consolation prize for the borderline food."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!! My boyfriend and I order take out from this place at least once every 10 days and honestly every single time it's amazing. The order is here so fast and the food is always so fresh and hot!!!! It makes me so happy that the quality is always so consistent. We just ordered and I swear I just had the best spring roll of my entire life!!!! Keep it up!!!!"}
{"text":"Good quality food at reasonable prices and decent décor.  Been to most Mandarin restaurants in the GTA over 60 times. This one happens to be close to my house. Been there with family, friends and colleagues. Nice atmosphere, good food, great selection and good service. More than 60% of the dishes in the buffet can be categorized as delicious.   Love their dumplings (more variety during the dumpling festival near Chinese new year) and their Crab legs (Friday & Saturday night)."}
