{"text":"I grew up in Texas and Oklahoma, so I know real barbecue.  And I love it.  Unfortunately, living in Ohio, it's difficult to find an authentic barbecue joint.  There are maybe 2 or 3 in between Columbus and Cleveland that I know of, that serve it up like they do down south.  Bullies Real BBQ is not one of them.  My dad and I made the trip up from Green to try it out last Saturday.  I had heard some good things about Bullies from a couple of friends of mine (albeit they're Ohioans and therefore, not used to eating good barbecue), so our expectations were higher than usual.    To sum it up, we were pretty disappointed.  We both ordered their \"pick any two\" combo platter with the ribs and the brisket.  The ribs were severely overcooked, dry and grey inside, with a hint of pink showing in the thicker portion of the rib meat.  The brisket was atrocious.  Out of all the barbecue joints I've eaten at in my lifetime, I've never seen it prepared like Bullies prepares it.  It resembled Arby's roast beef more than brisket - shaved like deli meat and overcooked, either in some type of au jus or in a microwave.  When it came to the table, it was hiding under the ribs, in a pile.  It had a tough, rubbery texture and was almost tasteless.  The sauces were fine, but nothing to rave about.  We also got french fries, cornbread and dry rub wings, all of which were decent.  And so the quest for good barbecue in Ohio continues.  For now, I'll keep going to Old Carolina (Akron, Canton), City Barbecue (Columbus), and Famous Dave's (North Olmsted)."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of sauces and I rarely eat any ribs or chicken without a good dose of bbq so I generally rate the bbq sauce as much as the food.  That is until I ate at Bullies.   The waitress encouraged me to taste the ribs prior to putting any sauce on them and I was so glad I did.  The rib meat was practically falling off the bone, melted in your mouth and the flavor was wonderful!  The pulled pork was really good too although I prefer it to be simmered in the bbq sauce and it doesn't come that way.  Everything comes dry and you add your own sauce.  The sauces were ok, but not great...I prefer a sweet baby ray's style or famous dave's thicker sauce that sticks to anything.  Bullies sauces are very flavorful, but too thin in my humble opinion.    Overall the food was great, the service was good and the staff was very friendly.  Prices were also right in line with what you would expect.    If any part of you likes bbq, you have to try bullies....it's worth the stop!"}
{"text":"The best dry rub wings around I love the super hot bobs dry rub. Ribs are  fair they do have good BBQ sauces. Service is fast the beer is cold. The bathrooms are super clean. I always Enjoy myself"}
{"text":"The idea is cute.  Who wouldn't love an eating place named after their dogs!  Three French bull dogs to be exact.  Their pictures are on the wall when you walk in the door.  The restaurant inside hasn't changed since it was the \"Tumbleweed\" a year or more ago.  Inside looks like it could be a chain but I don't think it is.  There is a small bar and lots of TVs on the walls, almost like a sports bar.  Once we were seated, the waitress was very friendly and helpful.  The menu is on the place mat.  There is quite a difference in prices between the sandwiches of pulled pork and pulled chicken that come with french fries and coleslaw and the dinners that come with the same.  You also get a piece of cornbread that was very good.  The sandwiches are like $6.99 and the dinners anywhere from $8.99 to $18.99.  We chose the half chicken dinner.  The chicken had an interesting rub on it of pepper and I'm sure brown sugar with other herbs and spices.  It was very good.  The 3 types of BBQ sauces are on the table which you ad yourself.  One very common, one sweeter and one a little hot but not fire hot.  French fries were pretty good but the coleslaw was quite bland.  I will try this place again because it is close to home and I want to try the sandwiches.  The portions are good sized.  No WiFi"}
{"text":"Best Perch in NE Ohio!  Not what you expect from a bbq joint, but Bob brought the recipe over from the Pufferbelly, where he was cooking Perch long before he ever started the smoker!"}
{"text":"One star will have to do until the next time I get by there. Two bucks for a small square of corn-bread. Also, don't advertise Pacifico beer unless you are going to sell it.   The food is good, no complaints there."}
{"text":"Best BBQ and wing place around. The Bobs Rub and Spicy Bobs Rub for the wings is incredible!  Try the slow burn sauce, it's my favorite. Onion rings are outstanding.  Tuesday is 50 cent wings.  Thursday is buck a bone night for ribs. Service is good and the staff is friendly.   Stop by next time your in Medina."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced. Great pulled pork. Smoked corned beef sandwich is outstanding. Different sauces for different tastes."}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ place.  They have three different kinds of BBQ sauce that they sit out on the table.  They seem to refill them multiple times a day, because no matter when I'm there, the BBQ sauce at the table is fridge-cold.   I could eat their fries and sweet BBQ sauce for every meal.    The half-chicken was so tender and had a great rub on the skin.  Their beef brisket is sliced super-thin like roast beef, and is soo good.  Me and my fiance split a Mombo Combo and had plenty of leftovers to take home (basically another dinner for each of us).  I got the lake perch special the first time I stopped in.  It was clearly hand-battered from fresh fillets, and was delicious.  They're generous with the tartar sauce.  They've got two different kinds of cole slaw; regular and Carolina.  I haven't had their Carolina cole slaw, but I guess it'd be a nice option for those who prefer a vinegar-based cole slaw as opposed to the more KFC-like variety.  I asked last time I was there and they said they're not a franchise.  I ate there this evening because I signed up for their email coupons and they gave me a $5 off $20 coupon instantly.  I don't think they have a lunch-only menu, just some daily specials.  That's their only downside in my book.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Let's get one thing straight here: I'm from southern Texas. Ribs (and BBQ in general) are my life.   I don't do 'sides' or dessert, so I can't comment on that. (as my baby sister put it when the waitress asked what sides she wanted with her ribs, \"Wet wipes and a glass of sweet tea.\")  Here's what I do know: The ribs at Bullies are quite possibly the best you'll get outside of Texas. They're dry-rub smoked ribs with an obvious smoke ring when you bite into them. They're tender but not fall-off-the-bone tender. I don't even know why people think that is a good thing. I don't want to pick up a rib and have it fall apart on me. That's pulled pork, people. Ribs should be bite-tender....eg. you bite, it comes away from the bone easily.   Service was decent, nothing to write home about. My drink sat mostly empty every now and again, but nothing I'd be overly fussy about."}
{"text":"Holy smokin ribs! Very good ribs and the meat just fell right off the bone. The fries were good but the corn bread had a weird taste.   Service was good."}
{"text":"We went to Bullies last week, and would consider going again.  The food was pretty good, and the prices were average for the genre.  The environment is a mixed bag of backwoods cabin and a dog lovers obsession, not that it's a bad thing...just a weird mix.  The service that night was a bit hit or miss, and it wasn't too busy.  Our server disappeared half way through our dining for longer than should be expected.   Pros:  Good food at a great price.   Try the onion rings. Prices are reasonable. Not very busy on a typically busy night for restaurants. Seated very quickly. Service was friendly Cons: Tomato is spelled incorrectly on menu. Made me think that other short falls were waiting for us in the food. If you ask for a burger to be made medium, double check it.  My wife's came out med-rare. Their sauce selection is confusing at first, and not really all that exciting. Server not as attentive as I'd prefer"}
{"text":"Bullies BBQ was alright.  I've experienced better service elsewhere.  It felt a bit closer to fast food than table service.  We had to get our own condiments from another table.  The labels on the condiments are misleading.  Also, our waitress was a little awkward but not unbearably so.  She may have referred to one of my friends as fuzzy because of his beard (I didn't really hear her comment).  There are pictures of bull dogs everywhere.  Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere.  3 out of 5 stars."}
