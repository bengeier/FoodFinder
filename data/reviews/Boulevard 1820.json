{"text":"Went here for the first time with 5 people with no reservations on a Saturday night. We were seated immediately. Our waitress Madison was fantastic. The shows were fantastic. The drinks were fantastic. The reason for a 3/5 Star review is because of the condition of the men's bathroom and quality of the food. The men's bathroom smelled of urine and had multiple pee spots on the floor throughout, yuck. For the food, here's my thoughts... shrimp tacos = amazing; chicken nachos = OK but chicken was a little thick; fried pickles = too juicy with not a lot of breading and they had been sitting out for a while before we got them because they were cold. Overall, I will return and see what I think again after ordering something else."}
{"text":"The staff is great. Food is terrible. Honestly. Wish I could say more to make this staff stand out but the food...at lest the appetizers are literally the worst I've tasted in a long time (read: ever)."}
{"text":"Wow what could I say. This place has so much potential but can't live up to it. 
We got there on valentines night with friends from out of town. 
They sit us in a corner where we can't see the stage. 
Our server was Erica who was great wasn't her fault I think she was the only one that was serving that night. She took our order and when she brought my husbands food out she let us all know they are out of what we had ordered. 
Would have been nice to know before she brought out just one persons order.  
I try to order again and guess what they were out of that too. 
The place was freezing cold. Saw a couple leave due to the service and cold. 
The food was over cooked and not good btw took 1:45 to get our meal.  Not sure if it was an off night but they better get their place in order or it won't be around longer."}
{"text":"This place has a good vibe! Ty is the best!!!! More people should give this place a try! Ask for TY because not only is he the best bartender, but he should get paid for his comedy!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has so much potential. However this restaurant seemed like it was their opening day. 
The temperature of the restaurant was too cold. 
4 of us went to eat. We order 3 pizzas and 1 order of wings. When the lovely server Erica brought the wings 30 minutes later she mentioned they were out of pizza. So 1 of us ate while we order and waited for something else. Finally they brought our food they weren't out of and we had a mediocre burnt sliders and a bad grilled cheese sandwich. Way more bread hardly any cheese. This should be more of a bar. They don't seem to know how to be a restaurant. The drag queens were unenergetic. Ru Paul would cry if she came here."}
{"text":"Fun! Fun! Fun! A bunch of friends and I visited on a Thursday which is game night. At first we were disappointed that it wasn't a normal night of performances and were told it was Bingo \"Drago\"  night. We were not disappointed!! The Drago game was so much fun! The staff performed and sang for us. I haven't had this much fun in a long time. I will definitely be visiting again but on a weekend this time!"}
{"text":"There are few places in Charlotte that you can go to that are empty on a Saturday, but this little gem is primed and ready, almost. 

The members only thing? Que es esto? Maybe I've away from the lounge scene too long. Yes, it was easy to join. Fill out a form, get a card. 

The drinks, for a Charlotte bar, were over priced. There's only one food item. Some sort of Mediterranean ; they were meh. 

The DJ played a decent variety of music making me feel like I was back in high school. Meh

Would I go back, meh."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and the last show on Sunday.  This is a nice little place to unwind and the remodel makes it more inviting than the aqua club.  It was a small crowd on a Sunday, but the drag show went on.  Our waitress Jackie was part of the 3 artist show and everyone was great!  This was our 1st time and we intend to try to get in to see more of their shows.  We ordered med rare burgers, but they came out medium well.  However, they were seasoned well and edible! We were older than other patrons, but they welcomed us and treated us kindly. We will definitely return and support"}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. What a wonderful place! The decor is fantastic. The service staff are super friendly and upbeat! Moderately priced and well worth what you pay for. Decent selection of liquor; also wasn't expecting them to have Fernet Branca. Great variety of draught beer and wine.  I've been a few times for their Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday showcases with professional, polished entertainers. On Tuesday they do a cult movie night and Thursdays are game night. You won't leave disappointed or without a smile and some good laughs."}
{"text":"The staff members are personable and at tentative. The decor is amazingly warm and inviting. The acoustics are divine. Pick an evening with live music!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for newcomers! They have live bands and offer great food and drink specials"}
{"text":"We had so much fun here.
The entertainment was a blast, good was good, and drinks were good as well. 
The drag show was a blast, the Queens were sweet, and we will definitely be back to have another girl's night.
Thank you for all of the fun we had tonight... Even if we were wearing the same wig!"}
{"text":"One of South End's newest live music venues that I have been to several times since its soft opening a couple of weeks ago.   The space is beautiful with great staff who are very friendly and good at making a drink (The most important part).  The bands have been great with the music not so overwhelming that you can't talk if you want.  Plus a small menu of tasty items if you want to grab a bite to eat.  It is a new venue so still getting its legs under it but I love this place and plan on making it a regular stop!!"}
{"text":"Great addition to south end & charlotte. Amazing space, good music, atmosphere is top notch, bar tenders are friendly and make great drinks. Highly recommend it and can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"its a nice spot. drinks are strong and the food was good which is a plus. my only issue was the waitress took forever to bring drinks or even bring my check. I had to hunt her down or ask another waitress for something if I wanted it. over all I may return but just sit at the bar. the drag show was good I enjoyed it"}
{"text":"First time. Only 2 tables in entire place with people (at 7:30 on a Saturday night). Tried to seat my husband & me in a dark corner right next to one of the only 2 occupied tables. We asked to sit somewhere else and were told no. This is a true story. We were shocked. We left & probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Celebrated my Bachelorette here this past fall and brought my mom to her first drag brunch today and very much enjoyed both times! Great food, yummy (and strong) drinks, welcoming and friendly staff, and a great show! Adding to my list of happy places!"}
{"text":"Boulevard 1820 is a fantastic restaurant with excellent food, fantastic drinks, and stellar entertainment from drag queens native to Charlotte and out of town. Great atmosphere and awesome porch to sit out on. Rachel is the best bartender, always sweet and takes care of you. Wait staff is always friendly. Definitely an awesome place to check out if you like tasty noms and drag queens!"}
{"text":"New and needed, a relaxed venue for live performances, food and cozy space to have a different kind of evening!!  A refreshing change from the \"club\" scene.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Have gone several times. I love this place. It's walking distance from my apartment. Friendly staff and great bands. I will be going back often and hope others give this place a try. It's a great new place in southend."}
{"text":"This place is so fun. Great spot for a special event or just a night out with friends. The food is pretty decent considering it's very much second to the amazing queens that you are really there to see. Check this place out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great place to hang. Great crowd and atmosphere. Definitely making this my new place to hang out."}
{"text":"This is a tokenized, fetishized version of queer life. It's drag queens in sneakers serving terrible food to heterosexual bachelorette parties videotaping a \"wild night out.\" 

It's offensive to Charlotte's gay community. We deserve better. We're not a photo opp."}
{"text":"Wish there were more places like this that offered the same level of fun and quality of food. This place is a must visit and is inclusive of everyone. Best place to have dinner and cocktails with friends, the alcohol isn't watered down and expense isn't spared. These ladies know how to throw a damn good party from the moment you walk in the door and sit down to enjoy your night. If you haven't gone, then you have know idea what you are missing."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time. This place misses the mark in every way. The service is horrible, the food is lackluster and the \"queens\" are just some old hags in drugstore makeup. I booked a party of 25. They stuck us in a dark corner and ignored us. We didn't get served for over an hour and several members of our party didn't even get their food. What a drag, and not in a good way."}
{"text":"The drinks and service are good! The remodel looks great. The food was frankly embarrassing. The charcuterie plate was like nothing I have ever seen. It looks like sliced American on a plate and didn't taste any better.  Wings were soggy and the quesadilla was unimpressive. If drinks is what you want to serve that's wonderful, but don't serve food if you aren't going to even try."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and drinks last night during the RPDR screening. Auntie Carol did a fantastic job of serving us and serving looks at the same time. Drinks are strong, food is solid, and the atmosphere is casual and fun. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great decor, great vibe, great craft cocktails,  and very nice staff!
This is a beautiful space! It is elegant enough to bring a date, and casual enough to watch a game or your favorite local musicians.
Highly recommended the Old Fashioned!
Bartenders know what they are doing!"}
{"text":"So much fun!! Food was good (over priced but cover charge is only $1.99 so you're paying for the show with the food prices), waitress was entertaining but the show was awesome!! Classy fun:)"}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant and experience first of it kind in the charlotte and the premier spot for birthdays and celebrations and thr best of Charlotte drag queens!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for a bite amd a drink after work. Paul was great, personable and knowledgeable. Had a quesadilla and some wings. Both were great. Old fashioned was one of the best I have had in a long time. I had to get a couple more to make sure and sure enough, great. I'll definitely be back."}
