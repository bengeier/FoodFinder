{"text":"Gotta be a stoner man who loves Cheech and Chong to really appreciate the atmosphere, but if you like toasty subs with a great flavor, awesome iced tea, homemade brownies, and great mac salad, you can still show up if you're an uptight honkey.  I always find the people here super friendly, and it's funny to watch all the young punks and skateboarders stumble in and out."}
{"text":"I had to bartend down the street at The Lava Lounge on Friday night for state wrestling and stopped in for a sandwich. The place is bright and very clean. I was greeted immediately and ordered...The sandwich was awesome! The cereal bar snack was delightful! I never write yelp reviews and I felt compelled to because these guys have it figured out!! The staff was super friendly! I will tell everyone I know!! Five Stars!!"}
{"text":"One of the managers responded to my honest review and gave me a number to call so he could better understand. After listening and understanding the challenge, he accepted responsibility, apologized, and offered to make it up to me.  

This IMO was great customer service, and I am excited to allow Cheeba hut back into the fold of dining considerations.

P.S. Cheeba Hut tastes delicious even when seethingly angry :)"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome!  I have been coming here for years and I've never had a bad experience. Without a doubt, best sandwiches in town!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite place for a sandwich! I've tried about every sandwich on the menu and every time I still have trouble deciding what to get. The Kail Mist, the krispy treats, the kool-aid all combine for the perfect mix whether you have THE munchies or just the munchies ;) Only thing I'm not a huge fan of is how some employees seem to abuse the casual, kick back kind of attire to where it looks like they seriously just rolled out of bed without, at the least, a body shower. Other than that I'll continue being a repeat!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, friendly staff, and tasty toasted subs. I got a pinner sized  Midwest's best. They made it fresh and to order. I will choose quality over \"freaky fast\" any time."}
{"text":"Ask them to wear a hair net when they make your sandwich. I used to eat here a lot till I got hair in 3 sandwhich's. Two where on the same day. Hell no will I go back"}
{"text":"I like the koolaid  machine. Very unique place. I got a turkey sandwich and liked it."}
{"text":"I was eating a delicious sandwich while watching Tom and Jerry cartoons with Modest Mouse playing and they got Kool-Aid on tap, that's what's up."}
{"text":"I usually have absolutely no problem. But sometimes one problem is all it takes. I had arranged for a future order. They decided they didn't care and delivered it at 340-345. I wasn't home yet so couldn't receive the food. I was unaware they tried to deliver food as they did not leave a message. So I waited until 430 and called. They said they could run it out again but I was due at work at 5. So I had to pick it up. It was ready when I got there. Yet I still tipped the driver because of pre posted tip. And also a delivery fee. I just feel like they made me feel like the bad guy when they screwed up. Accidents happen but don't blame the customer."}
{"text":"Cheba hut is awesome! Salads, toasted subs, and other munchies to top it off. Casual and clean."}
{"text":"Cheba hut is great, the atmosphere, the food, the music, and did i mention the FOOD ?? This sub shop is anything but ordinary, the first thing you'll notice is the laid back feel, the great music, and the awesome decor. The staff are also way cool, as well as the crowd,  it's a cool place to people watch. Even the sub sizes are extraordinary, you may pick from the following : Nug (4' ), Pinner ( 8'), or if you've got the extra munchies go with The blunt (12'). 

To add to it's uniqueness all the subs carry the various names of the lovely lady Mary Jane. They also have quite the collection of no meat subs for our veggie friends out there, I'd personally recommend the Griefo. It's a garden veggie sub with guac, mushrooms, and cheba huts very own creation : hemp cream cheese. If you like a little more meat on your sub try The Kind (turkey, bacon, swiss, and mushroom) or The Pakalolo (ham, swiss, and pineapple). These are personal faves of mine. 

Lastly, they have lots of tasty treats to pair with your meal, such as brownies (hemp is great!), goo balls, rice krispie bars, ect. 

So next time your down by MCC, just look for the bright green VW bus and you'll find Cheba hut: Home of  The Blunts !"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients but they will make your sandwich however the fuck they want. Every. Single. Time. I eat here it is never how I ordered it no matter how explicitly I explain my order."}
{"text":"What can I say?? I love this place. Best sandwiches ever! I love the Kali Mist. I'm not sure if it's because I'm from Cali or the toppings are great or a bit of both. Needless to say every time I go in I plan to try a different one and I end up ordering the same one. Lol. I love their garlic herb bread. The toppings are so fresh and delicious and having it toasted make it all one great sandwich. Give this place a try. Any sandwich will be great!"}
{"text":"I'm  going to go out on a limb and say outside my dinky half-pint kitchen, Cheba Hut offers the best subs in the area. 

One would think, \"Oh Cheba Hut is all about the ambiance. You are paying for the experience, not the food\". But to that I say, \"Nay, good Sir. Cheba Hut subs doth rock mine socks.\"

As other reviews stated, the subs are named after different kinds of weed and the sizes are nugs (4\"), pinners (8\") and blunts (12\"). There's tacky weed stuff everywhere. Very \"groovy\" to say the least.

The subs are toasted (on white, wheat or garlic herb bread) and loaded up with all sorts of interesting ingredients. No boring sammies here, unless you so choose (looking at you, ham and swiss dude). 

I recently had my first vegan sub at Cheba Hut and it was AMAZING! I had my girlfriend build me what I affectionately call \"The Angie\". It was a Majic Mushroom (teriyaki portabello) with pineapples, onion, fresh mushrooms, sprouts, cucumbers, bell pepper, greek dressing, tomato and probably some other stuff I can't remember. 

Amazing! 

The only thing that creeps me out about Cheba is that you can't see your sandwich as they're making it. I worry that the line is really dirty or that they are flossing my bun with a strip of bacon. It kind of adds to the experience though because you don't know how your Cheba Hut creation will look until it's right in front of you.

The place does get kind of loud, so be prepared.

Also, they used to deliver but according to Yelp they don't...so something to look into. 

It would be a shame if stoners had to get behind the wheel in order to get their Cheba Hut fix."}
{"text":"Best drunk food in Madison. My favorites are the white widow and the Kali Mist. Get any sandwich loaded up and with chipotle mayo on garlic and herb."}
{"text":"I still have no idea what a Cheba is or where you find one.  Maybe in the Garden of Weeden.  I tried this place for the first time the other day ~ had a Chronic, their bar-b-cue sub and Ya MON!  It was very YA MON!  I was sent to the Garden of Weeden by the scrumptious flavor of this sub.  So I say long live the Cheeba Hut."}
{"text":"Oh chebba hut! So simple, so good, and love the vibe. Wish I went here sooner from there veggie subs to there amazing white widow sub and brownies theres so much to enjoy. They also have amazing tropical tea thats my favorite!"}
{"text":"For toasted subs, do not, I repeat, DO NOT go to Quizno's! Come to the Cheeb instead, where your hummus gets toasty, your eggplant crispy, and your chicken salad stays nice and cool. Some favorites (besides the aforementioned) include the pastrami, loaded with pepperoncinis, the meatball (of course), and the mushroom. Everyone is super-cool, and they don't even bat an eyelash if you want marinara AND mayo. Thank you, Cheba Hut, for your acceptance!"}
{"text":"I work in the area and when I can afford it ( Quizno's price range), I'ts my favorite sub shop. The staff is always entertaining and friendly and the subs are tasty. Try the \"Silver Haze\", hummus and swiss with lots of veggies, skip the black olives. It is soooo good, The decor makes the wait worthwhile."}
{"text":"This place is totally wicked. Ive been eating here for years and it only gets better. Since renovating a while back, this awesome sandwich joint even has a small bar in the back and tons of seating. The staff are cool, sometimes a little slow but the food is always great. They even have Kool Aid fountains! You wont find another place like it. Unique toasty subs, dope atmosphere, and great Kool Aid!"}
{"text":"Wow just wow. Visited today for the first time, on a Wednesday afternoon it was pretty busy and for good reason. Awesome atmosphere, friendly service and the pretzel nuggets with spicy ranch were delicious. Will be back to try some more sandwiches (they have quite a few to choose from) and to see what the weekly bar specials are all about!"}
{"text":"It really hits the spot and they have Kool-Aid"}
{"text":"Great Things come to those who wait. Cheba Hut Sandwiches are no different, yes the sandwiches do take awhile to come out but they are ALWAYS great. I Highly recommend the blue fin, cold w/ cream cheese instead of mayo/cheese"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular, but I left for a couple months, came back, and they changed everything. Took my favorite sandwich off the menu and rearranged everything on the menu so I suddenly found myself scanning to find a different vegetarian sub to choose from with a snarky little cashier in front of me giving me attitude while I tried to make up my mind quickly. Not pleasant. I normally tip, but not this time. I got the bill and figured out that Cheba raised their prices. Didn't realize that the bill was also high because the cashier rang me up for a 12\" when I asked for an 8\". And when I tried to put ice in my cup for a soda, nothing would come out but slush. Never going back! As if it's not hard enough to find decent vegetarian food, they took two of those sandwiches off the menu AND raised prices. Done with them."}
{"text":"Staff could use some brains, food could be better, style could be less predictable. Two bad experiences are enough, I'll eat elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Cheba Hut used to be our all time favorite place for great sandwiches, but it has changed.  First they dropped some of our favorites and modified others.  But we carried on.  Last night was the last straw.  I called in an order for a couple of sandwiches, a Blue Pacific Tuna for myself.  It has now become a \"Blue Pacific Tuna Melt\" which means it has 1/3 the amount of tuna as before plus 1 thin piece of a white translucent substance masquerading as cheese.  It looked nothing like what I have come to expect.  In the past all the sandwiches I have ordered are big  enough for two lunches (half today and half tomorrow).  And to top it all off the prices have gone up!  So...what's going on with Cheba Hut?  I suspect our dark corporate overlords have had their way with my favorite sandwich shop.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Just a lovely laid back place. I'm not the biggest sub person, but the atmosphere is hard to beat. The employees are very laid back and friendly, and even friendlier if you happen to come in while in what we might call an \"altered state of mind\". The food is excellent. It's always really fresh and once you try it, it makes Subway look pretty crappy in comparison."}
{"text":"So tasty, and the vegetarian ones are delicious too though the Thai stick is my fav. Have to get a cap'n crunch Krispy treat too, sooooooo good. Can be a long wait for lunch so try calling in"}
{"text":"Took one bite and pauses to write this review simply amazing white widow was on point love it and I'm from Chicago enough said thanks guys and hopes this pumps up new business blunt size all day :)))"}
{"text":"Tasty baked subs! La Canna (Italian) is king and the parking here is great since it's the only thing really worth going to in a little shopping center."}
{"text":"Doesn't matter what the service is, this place is awesome. Hippie/stoner vibe. \"Where the only thing fried is an occasional customer\". Toasted subs here beat quiznos in my book."}
{"text":"My first time here--nice relaxed atmosphere, good selection. My Greek chicken sandwich was on a crispy toasted roll, tasty with kalamata olives, pickle and feta. Hospitable, comfortable, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Kush with all the fixings.... Never had a problem with pick-up or dine-in. But tonight will be the last time I ever think about getting delivery from these guys. Our delivery took over an hour.....and we got an entirely different order.... I called back and let them know and they took over 30 minutes to get our correct sandwiches delivered. To add insult to injury, apparently lettuce is no longer served with BLT's as I barely had anything but bacon on my sandwich..... I'm terribly disappointed after spending a long time starving for my food."}
{"text":"How a sub should be....with koolaid on tap. Best sandwhich I've had. White widow with spicy chicken"}
{"text":"Place is a dump but the sandwiches are amazing. Super fresh and clearly made with love. Eat a lot, but go somewhere else to use the bathroom."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how long I have been going to Cheba Hut, but I can tell that I will continue to frequent these establishments in the future!

For the money, it is a great value. They always load up the extras on my Majik Mushroom or Afghani sandwiches (on wheat). The subs are toasted to perfection. The ingredient quality is superior to even the most elegant of competitors. They even have spring mix lettuce instead of using iceberg! 

The environment is great! Incredible music is always blasting from the speakers. You will hear Led Zeppelin followed by Jimi, and then a little DMB to keep you entertained while munching on your grub. And the staff is always friendly and genuine.

Looking forward to the next encounter with Cheba Hut."}
{"text":"I love the food here but damn does it have some of the worst service around ordered a sandwich on non peak times and it took 40 mins to come out. This has happened on more than one occasion so just be prepared that your food could seriously take almost an hr to come out"}
{"text":"I love some chebahut. I love the French dip \"AK 47\". The \"pacific blue \" tuna melt is also a very great choice. I have also tried the \"cali mist\" and \"silver haze\" all were really great. Fun stoner atmosphere and kept very clean."}
{"text":"I came here a while back when I was getting a tattoo done next door. The food was great! I got a buffalo chicken sandwich that was to die for. I would recommend this place for those looking for a quick bite to eat, as well as quality. 

The only bad side to this place is the location. 59th Avenue and Olive is not the best of neighborhoods. For the more cautious, I would recommend getting your food from here while the sun is out. After the sun sets, you are bound to find a lot of shady characters walking about and asking for change/cigarettes."}
{"text":"Bro bro bro......lol!!! Been there twice but has to be one of the best sub shops I've been to. Both were blunts (ak-47) and the (5-0). Fantastic, I will be back again and again, whenever I get those munchies...lol"}
{"text":"Great phone service. Promised delivery time. Cool delivery dude. CRAZY good food.   I will be eating here again very soon."}
{"text":"Great food!  Overall good experience!  There was a blonde gal that was very helpful, patient and knowledgeable.  Made us feel appreciated and interested in suggesting anything to be helpful.

Brunette tall woman was rude.  Gave a stink over ranch and marinara.  Everyone else was super cool and showed a willingness to be helpful.  We will come back, but more than likely avoid her and her customer isn't right attitude. We don't mind paying more for sides of ranch and marinara.  

We were pleased with the food.  I had the dank and my husband had the white widow.  Full and happy!  Thanks Cheba Hut!"}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre given the hype... If you're going to make a stoner type environment you have to have the best munchie worthy sandwiches out there! I couldn't even finish my French Dip the meat was so flavorless."}
{"text":"nick was horribly rude, we waited an hour for our food only to find literally everysandwhich was wrong. change the staff"}
{"text":"The Mesa location is far superior to the one on University...plus they have the better potato salad. I'm all about the herb, but there have been numerous times where my sub was made incorrectly because the person seemed all stoned out. Definitely go to Mesa!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times when visiting Madison.  The ambience is welcoming and friendly with great music always playing.   The vegetarian sandwich options are amazing.   Fresh ingredients for the tasty sandwiches and the friendly and helpful staff will give you some ideas for coming up with an interesting combination.  Nice to be able to get a local craft beer as well.  Do not leave without getting a Goo Ball.   One of the best munchies!!  This is not your average fast food place.  Great place to go with friends to chill and enjoy a great sandwich."}
{"text":"I haven't tried a sandwich I haven't liked on their menu. Quality ingredients overall. Can't go wrong with \"5-0\" or meatball subs."}
{"text":"I volunteer once a week at the Cup O Karma Community Cafe for a Cause, next door to Cheba Hut in Mesa, Az. I look forward to a \"Griefo\" so much, that like Pavlov's dogs I start to salivate when I pull into the parking lot! I've gotten to know some of the employees that work there, and am impressed by the kindness they show their customers, as well as their work ethic. Every sub is made fresh, and they always remember that I don't like black olives!"}
{"text":"The food is good but they can never get the order right. I have given them the benefit of the doubt more than a few times but I think I'm done this time. The food is good but does not taste the same when they forget the mayo or the right type of cheese. So for those folks who go here double yet triple check your order otherwise your experience will suck. Sorry I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Best tasting sandwiches around, not only that the names of the sandwiches are great!! Love the White Widow on the herb bread blunt size!"}
{"text":"Love this spot! Enough variety to keep me interested every time I roll through.

Step away from the \"White Widow\". Not that it's bad... It's just that there is so much more to enjoy here!

Kool-Aid is a great touch too. 

Don't be afraid or put off by the theme of the place. The food is dank."}
{"text":"Decent food, slow service! Came here after a concert, and it was busy, but not crazy. 35 minutes for a sandwich? Not an exaggeration, literally, 35 minutes...."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in town. This has become myfavorite sandwich shop.   Love the theme,  reminds me of my  youth.   Great friendly staff"}
{"text":"Yeah the theme is pot, so your going to get a lot of stoners working and eating.  But not everyone in their is baked.  Their specialty sandwiches are where its at and can be very tasty.  

I like to get the white widow, it is kind of heavy, but its filling, and make sure to get a goo ball (Rice crispy treat with peanut butter rolled into a ball).  Of course you don't have to go for those, but I sometimes do.  

Lately they have not been consistently good as they were two years ago, but I occasional stop in maybe once every 2-4 months for a sandwich.  So it is kind of a hit or miss with me now.  

Recommendation: This is not for kids or for people that do not like stoner culture, if your one of the latter of these people you will just leave pissed off that this establishment even exists."}
{"text":"As usual, I researched my restaurants for my business trip.  This store came up as a local favorite for sandwiches so off I went during lunch. As the name implies, the interior is filled with references.  I ordered the \"Afghani\" sandwich with the usual toppings.  I wish it had more of a kick to it as it was listed as \"spicy\".  Guess I'm used to my roommate's Indian cooking nowadays.

I wonder what my manager thought of \"Cheba Hut\" when I submitted the expense report..."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin. Ive never had a bad sandwich. Tried many different ones. My favorite one is the kgb. It's amazing. Try the purple haze beer. The home made rice crispy treats. Oh my God and the drink selection.. they have TANG ON TAP!  LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Sheer coincidence that I'm writing a review for Cheba hut on 4-20. But where else should you go when you're blitzted out of your mind on 4-20 and you want a hot toasted sub? EXACTLY!!!"}
{"text":"Best sub place in the valley. Amazing variety of subsvegetarian selections. Never dissapoints."}
{"text":"After finding out that Cheba Hut was expanding, I just had to see what the hype was about...and it was totally worth it. 

The second we walked in, I immediately loved the atmosphere. True to their name, they had a lot of theme decorations and quirky posters.

I ended up trying a The Kind pinner. Turkey, swiss, bacon, and mushroom on wheat. It was delish! There's something about the bread that brings everything together. 

I'll have to try their garlic \"herb\" bread next time :)"}
{"text":"I had been coming to this location for over 3 years every week.   We would place a pickup order and EVERY time they would tell us we could pick up in 20 minutes. 5 times in a row I had to wait an additional 40 minutes (After the 20 minutes i was told) in the store for the food to be done. The last straw was last week when I had waited over 1 hour in the store.  An employee asked what the order name was and I told them.  They then informed me that they hadn't even started making my order yet! They had forgotten or somebody had misplaced it.  At this point I felt the need to tell the manager about my experience.  His exact response was \"If you don't like the service why do you keep coming?\"  I was appalled as was the employee standing next to him.  Now knowing that they have no care for other people's time or respect I will NEVFR return to this place!"}
{"text":"Cheba Hut is very much a novelty sub sandwich shop. It's main focus is Marijuana but also has some funny suggestive items towards other psychedelic drugs. (i.e their vegetarian friendly majic mushroom.) I've been coming to the Tempe location for about 10 years. I enjoy this location more then the two newer locations in Glendale and Mesa, mainly because the staff here. They cycle out on average about every year; but like a moderate t.v. show guest appearances but previous employees happen. They expanded a few years back to doubling the size of the original establishment. They have kept the overall same feel for atmosphere. 

Pro tip: everyone who works here is continuously inebriated. This is part of the experience. Don't trip, (pardon the pun) if your food is slightly wrong."}
{"text":"Used to eat Cheba Hut in Tucson and was delighted that they have another location down the street from us in Glendale. Pretty much everything on the menu is on point and satisfies the stomach. Favorite is the bomb meatball sub with peppers and mushrooms. The Cali mist and AK-47 are also really good. I think I have only eaten one bad meal from here and it was close to closing time so I blamed it on not so fresh bread. Make sure to try the goo balls!"}
{"text":"Although the people are great with customer, i believe the Cheba Hut on southern has better sandwiches."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches... I'm a fan of the Midwest Best and the White Widow. Been going here for a long time and anyone looking at reviews trying to decide... Just go and give it a shot man! it's a fun experience and the food is good, everyone is going there... No peer pressure!!! :)

They should have one of these in every campus town!"}
{"text":"this place is bomb. everything looks fresh and taste fresh. never a disappointment. you can pretty much design your own sandwich. they will also help you if your unsure what to get. the treats are cheap and freshly made. THEY ALSO STAY OPEN TILL MIDNIGHT EVERYDAY!"}
{"text":"Ahhh shizzy fizzy pizzy! This is the perfect sub spot to satisfy those lovely munchies. Vegetarian lovas will enjoy the majic mushroom sandwich on a blunt size garlic herb bread."}
{"text":"Came into Cheba hut today.  I ordered a sandwich.  A humbolt sandwich because I'm vegetarian.  I placed a to go order.  I went to sit down and wait for my order.  While I was sitting there, the boys working behind the counter was looking over at me.  One of the boys says, \"I think I lost my appetite.\"  The others were laughing.  They called my name to grab my order.  I received my order and left.  When I got back to work, I saw my sandwich, it was nothing but lettuce, a tiny slice of cheese, a couple of mushrooms, and that was it.

A humbolt has guacamole, lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, pickle, etc.  I ordered a four inch and received a sandwich smaller than my hand.

Service there is rude!  Use to love going there, but won't return there."}
{"text":"blunt griefo on wheat 
everyone in here is high 
four-twenty, bro ham"}
{"text":"I like Cheba. I have been going here for years. I like their sandwiches.
But it's nothing above and beyond any other sub shop minus, the factor that they have spouts and I LOVE SPROUTS.


I also DIG their brownies, probably more than I should.


What I dislike is the service, half the time the employee's seem baked out of their mind and it takes them 10 minutes to make a sub when there is all of 2 people in the place already done eating. 

I still will go here and enjoy my grub but definitely not tipping the employees."}
{"text":"Stoners know how to eat! Best sandwich in the valley by far. I've yet to have a bad meal or bad service at this joint . I have had most of the menu selections and they are all great. My personal favorite is the white widow (chicken, bacon, ranch)"}
{"text":"if you have seven dollars to spend on a sandwich, you can get a footlong from Quizno's or Subway, or you can get an 8-incher here, and realize exactly why you hate Quizno's and Subway. The place is marijuana-themed. I thought this was cute the first time I came here, since I'm from California, where it's virtually legal, and this was in Arizona, where Pot hadn't been legalized yet. (Although, the girl who made my food told me that AZ has recently legalized medicinal herbs, but that's a whole different story and review.)

The bread they use is baked fresh every day in a nearby bakery. Their ingredients are better than Subway or Quizno's, and their prices are moderately high, but well under 10 dollars, and completely worth it. Everything on the menu shares a name with a strain of marijuana, or something from pot culture. I liked that they're permanently unable to supply a sandwich known as \"Schwag,\" and their pork sandwich is called a 5-0.

Other points of interest are their photos of Chong eating there, Kool-Aid on tap next to their soda fountains, and a huge mural covering a wall and a half depicting what appears to be Adam and Eve smoking blunts in Eden. Of course, there are stickers everywhere, flyers for raves and parties near the sandwich prep area, and really friendly staff. I honestly can't find anything wrong with this place, other than the fact that they're a lot harder to find outside of Arizona.

These are honestly among the best sandwiches I've ever eaten at a restaurant. And though the place has a very heavy commitment to its theme, it avoids feeling gimmicky, and the food is definitely the star attraction. I make a pilgrimage to this restaurant every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome! La canna or thai stick r some of my favorites!  Munchies and antipasta salad n fruity pebble treat sure do make my tummy happy"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick lunch. 
The place is very campy, with cheesy marijuana innuendo decorating the walls and ceiling, and menu. 

I got the \"Endo\", Corned Beef, kraut and 1000-Island as the base of it. 
It did take like 10 minutes to make my sandwich come through the toaster oven. I'm a patient man, but it seemed a bit long considering there wasn't much business. 
The sandwich to me, seemed light on meat, but then again, I haven't been to a sandwich shop outside of Philly that doesn't pack it on. 
The place is cool for a bite to eat, the staff is cool and friendly, obviously enjoy their jobs, and makes for interesting people watching."}
{"text":"I have to say, it is definitely worth waiting a couple more minutes for a sub from Cheba   Hut.  I find they make a quality sub.  My only complaint is that without supervision it is common that they miss a few ingredients.  Nothing they are not willing to correct though!  My experience is always good at Cheba Hut.  They have great baked goods too!"}
{"text":"We ordered a Cali Mist and a Power Blunt. First of all they forgot the cheese in the Cali Mist and forgot pickles for both sandwiches. The service was terrible. They forgot my buffalo sauce and we had to ask the cashier more than 2 times for it. We paid a good amount of money to not get the right order. They were too high to function."}
{"text":"This place is great it has a very relaxed environment. And the stuff on the walls it's really cool too every time I look at it there's something different.. lol 
The food is good I always get the white widow with no mushrooms loaded! It's my favorite 
They have kool-aid on tap which is another plus and therelaxation snack menu has notchos which is Doritos chips withave cheese olives chicken if you want it and jalapenos! I've been coming here since I was in high school! 
Only down fall is the don't always clean tables off in a timely manner as there is not a lot of staff but they are always nice and will if you ask."}
{"text":"I had been to Cheba Hut numerous times before, and today's trip was a nice experience. I walked in and decided to try something new. I asked the cashier for a suggestion and he was more than helpful. I took his suggestion and ordered the Acapulco. It was a good meal and service was great!"}
{"text":"Two words for all you Yelpsters out there Jamaican widow. It's not on the menu but its a mix between the Jamaican red and the white widow and ask for extra ranch. I use to go there a couple times a week then I moved so I don't get to go as much as I would like. The employees are awesome and the owners are super friendly so enjoy."}
{"text":"Oh baby I need more cheba in my life! Stoners know how to make a sandwich man. On the occasion your cashier just go to back from \"break\" and you have to repeat your order 3x its just still so worth it. Every sandwich is delicious and the ingredients are quality! A must try is the white widow this was definitely created by someone with the munchies!"}
{"text":"It's rare to find a restaurant with such a high rating after so many reviews but this place is really that good.  My fav's are the Reuben, the Luke Skywalker and the Panama Red.  It's not fair to compare this place to Subway, that's like comparing Ruth's Chris' to Sizzler."}
{"text":"The subs are are a different experience! The whole atmosphere of the place is unique, but don't underestimate the food! The sub combinations are bizarre, but they work, and the flavors are outstanding. Definitely a place to check out downtown."}
{"text":"Love the Hut. Most sub shops have one token veggie sub, but not the Hut. They've got at least 7 different options for non-meat eaters, and they are all original and incredibly delicious. Best veggie subs: Humbolt, Griefo, Silver Haze, and my personal favorite, the Magic Mushroom: portabella mushrooms marinated in teriyaki sauce, topped with green peppers, pineapple & pepper jack cheese... Yum!

Yeah, it's got the whole doobie-licious theme going, and yeah, it's pretty hilarious, but it's the sandwiches that keep me coming back. And the rice krispie treats. Oh, and the hemp brownies. Can't forget about the brownies.

Service can be a little slow when they're busy, but it's so worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food here is amazing!  But there staff sucks.  I order from here all the time and get delivery.  Today because it was raining and there was a badger game I guess one of their employees decided that they don't deliver this far anymore.... I order cheba hut all the time and get delivery when i told him this he just said, \"oh well i don't know what to tell you.\". Okay? My roommate proceeded to call back an hour later and was told they could deliver to him, so you can imagine my disappointment. Literally appalled by this sort of inconsistency.  So pretty much my roommate, who lives at the same location, got food and I didn't awesome."}
{"text":"I don't see the allure to this place. My friends swear by the place, but I think it's just meh. While my meal was not bad, I would not go back. I come from Philly, the land of hoagies and sandwiches. The whole pot gimmick was nice and all for the college community, but the sandwiches were nothing special at all."}
{"text":"This place is cool! Employees are always cool, helpful, and nice. The menu is fun and unique. There are many options for vegetarians, and food is always good. I would recommend this place to anyone. I have had a couple experiences with them messing up my order, but it was always during a busy rush or lunch time. Everyone makes mistakes, and because this place is awesome I'm willing to overlook their lunch rush mix ups. Overall, Cheba Hut is good!"}
{"text":"The food is here is awesome and the service is decent. I love the concept and the dude has a great thing going."}
{"text":"These subs are the best!   This was the first time we had ever eaten here and I'm so glad we stopped. The theme is fun- but it is so much more than just that."}
{"text":"Your sandwich won't be the only thing that's toasted at Cheba Hut. The staff is usually high (and not on life) and giggly. And while it's nearly a 10-minute process to get your sandwich (you order, pay and then they call you when they're ready to pile on the fixings), the food is pretty good even when you're not high. Cheba is one of my favorite places to go to cure a hangover the next day because the sandwiches are damn tasty. I recommend The Kush and The Kind."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years and finally came back a few weeks ago. It's probably my favorite sandwich shop right now. The service was quick, the menu is pretty original and the food was great. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Makes iron chief look like a lean cuisine"}
{"text":"Cheba Hut, you rule the ganja universe. You rule the sober universe. You just rule. The kind is... The kindest."}
{"text":"I liked this place. The hummus plate was $5 and very filling. Sub was huge (the smallest one would be fine for a light lunch). Ranch dressing is awesome. Bathroom was gross though."}
{"text":"Funny names for subs, good price. 15 min wait at lunch but tastes great."}
{"text":"I recently moved from Surprise out to Tempe about a month ago. I live literally right across the street from Cheba Hut and was so excited because there was one across the street from my old college, it's a frequent hangout for college kids. The food is decent but I think the atmosphere and theme of the place is really what attracts people. I mean come on, how many weed themed places have you seen?! Haha However, since moving to Tempe and discovering a good dozen other sub places, I usually would try something else these days (huge Silver Mine Subs fan!) but all in all, Cheba Hut is decent and worth a shot if you've never been there (: Go get some \"toasted\" subs! haha"}
{"text":"Travel about 100 days per year and always looking for good food on the road. Ordered for delivery to hotel upon arrival in Tempe. Excellent sandwich and salad. Great price. Delivery took awhile, but they were honest about the delivery time and it was well worth the wait! Will definitely order there again before I depart from Tempe and will recommend the restaurant to other coworkers on this trip."}
{"text":"I love me some Cheba Hut. Great sandwiches all the time and the vibe is soooo laid back. Favorite sandwich is the Midwest Best. Toasted subs are so tasty. Come here as much as you can."}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome vegetarian subs"}
{"text":"Although I love this place, I do have one complaint. I don't know if the people making the sandwiches are high--though I guess in a place like this you can't be upset if they are--but the past TWO times I've been there, they've screwed up my order. Not totally destroyed it--but I ordered the Cali Mist and the first time I asked for avocado and jalapenos only on one half (I got a pinner)--when I got the sandwich there wasn't avocado on either half and jalapenos all over it. The second time I asked the fellow at the register, just to confirm that the sandwich came with avocado and he said yes. I told him I wanted it all over the sandwich and all of the other toppings as well--no changes to the normal order. When I got it home THERE WAS NO AVOCADO!! Don't get me wrong, it's still a great sandwich, but damn it! It's the principal. 
If they screw up my order ONE MORE TIME I'll never go back and I have been a loyal weekly customer because I do my laundry in the same plaza and usually grab a sandwich while I wait."}
{"text":"Thank you Cheba Hut!! I recently had to give up anything with gluten and you made me an amazing white widow salad. Thank you for accommodating my special request.  Five stars!!"}
{"text":"Do not let the name of this joint (see what I did there?) deter you from stopping in. A great little place near the Tempe ASU campus; the service is always friendly, everything is marijuana-punned, and they are pushing out great sandwiches."}
{"text":"As much as we have enjoyed Cheba huts food in the past we are NEVER coming back to this location!!! They are completely unprofessional, and we waited an HOUR for 2 damn sandwiches!! They even served a party of 4 and a party of 6 and others before serving us even though we were there before all of them. How hard is it to make 2 flipping sandwiches? Not to mention that they were breaking SEVERAL health code violations, which included no gloves, the cook eating food off the veggie counter and drinking while making sandwiches, spilling his drink on the counter, touching his face and clothing then touching people's sandwiches, it was disgusting! When 45 minutes had gone by we finally said something to one employee, but never got a valid reason as to why everyone else was getting served and not us. Completely unprofessional bunch of employees. The health department should absolutely be checking into this place!!!"}
{"text":"Idiot stoners can't even get a simple order right . Not worth your time I promise you."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. Friendly and courteous staff? The best sandwiches in town? Bomb cookies and Rice Crispy treats? Chilled Kool-aid on tap? Sure they take a while to get your order to you, but good things come to those who wait. One of my favorite places to eat. Period."}
{"text":"Sandwich's here are amazing.  The atmosphere is freaking awesome as long as you are.  Apollo 13 and the White Widow will blow your mind lol."}
{"text":"Food was tastey. Had a Reuben and a White Widow mini subs. The munchies are amazing. Great local beer on tap. Look forward to going back there soon."}
{"text":"Stumbled in with the homie off a wake n bake, i had a east coastern, first time trying that one, usually partial to the dank pinner n the munchies, chocolate chip cookies or rice crispy treats, da bomb, back to the east coastern, toasted n loaded with sammich toppings, i eat here when ever i pass by, its a do not miss on my list because aside from the sandwiches, their fresh baked munchies are not to miss."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the Cali Mist, the Pac Blue, and especially the Skywalker. They Skywalker has salami, pepperoni, provolone, cream cheese, pineapple and jalapeno. You wouldnt think it would, but it do.

Also, they have Kool-Aid and Tang. I cant go there without refilling my drink 3 times.

My only complaint is their northern delivery limit is university, yet they wont deliver on university."}
{"text":"What's not to love! Kool-Aid on tap amazing switches friendly staff and the price is reasonable. Go there if you get a chance"}
{"text":"Cheba Hut is very tasty! The sandwiches are creative and fun, but the last three times I have gone to this location my sandwich hasn't been right. I ordered the Green Crack substitute the roast beef for chicken loaded up with spring mix instead of iceberg. First time they didn't put any veggies on it. Just roast beef, cheese and jalapeno sour cream it comes with. Second time they got the chicken right but forget the guacamole and spring mix. And the last time I went they didn't put chicken again. 

I like your sandwiches but its annoying especially when you get it togo and don't notice its wrong by the time you've gone home :("}
{"text":"The food is good but it looks super dirty behind the counter. One of the employees is a loud mouth, chubby kid with a patchy mustache and goatee that is always having loud obnoxious conversations with his co workers. I overheard him talking about tazing dogs and almost slapped him in the mouth. 

Get rid of the kid and clean your kitchen. Other than that it's not a bad spot."}
{"text":"Best sub I've ever had. Period. 

I'm visiting from California, and my friend insisted that we go to Cheba Hut before heading home; I now understand her persistence. They suggested I get the Kali Mist, which was excellent (that chipotle mayo tho). The people were rad, food was bomb, and I'm bummed there isn't one closer to me. 

The shopping center it's located in may not look the best, but in my opinion, that is where the best food comes from lol"}
{"text":"I'm gonna have to go against the grain a bit here - I wanted SO badly to love this place! I had only heard good things, and the theme - although a bit over the top - is fun.

I ordered some Thai Teriyaki something something local special that they had written on a little blackboard in the front. It sounded amazing.

What I unwrapped was a sauce-filled mess with 6 flakes of weird lettuce and white tomato slices. Oh and a metric fuckton of pepper. The bun ripped apart at the seam, presumably because of the enormous amount of sauce that was on the sandwich. And I'm a SAUCE girl, people. If it pours or you can dip it then I want a lot of it. But this was over the top for even me. I threw over half my sandwich away. 

The staff was fine but unremarkable, no real complaint there. 

The inside is kind of grimy feeling but I get that it's part of the theme. If the sandwich was amazing it'd definitely be forgivable. 

Normally I'd give it a second chance, but with SO many different sub places around, I probably won't risk it again here."}
{"text":"Love their sandwiches, and I am a regular customer. Yesterday went with a colleague and they messed up her order. We ended up waiting for an hour and they still didnt get her sandwich. When we went to the counter and asked, they made one (which they brought to the table about 20 mins later) then it wasnt what she ordered! Very very disappointed with their service!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place, im so slow I had no idea what cheba meant upon reading the menu until my husband explained it to me. a bit on the expensive side though. spent $18 for 2 8\" subs :/ but I will go again"}
{"text":"Never been to Cheba hut, and I was expecting a good sandwich. My mistake.... I got the Ak47 which was quite possibly the worst sandwhich I ever had. It was an 8 sandwich with all hard thick bread and literally one thin piece of meat. It was supossed to come with onions and portebello mushrooms. I saw only 2-3 small pieces of onion. The girl who made and dropped off the sandwich at my table obviously didnt like het job, and she sucked at it! The only good thing about going to Cheba hut is drinking Pepsi in order to prevent yourself from choking on the abundance of bulky dry bread. This pathetic sandwhich, chips, and small drink cost almost $12 bucks! Stay far away from Chebas unless you like paying a lot for awful food and experience."}
{"text":"When we go there we order together so we can pay for our sandwiches as one transaction. One of the subs we order is an old special and they don't have a specific button for it but they know how to make it. occasionally they get it right and a few times they have missed one or two of the items that comes on the sub. Then when they call our name usually just I go up and tell them what additional toppings I want and the past few times.. by few I mean 4-6 times.. they just go ahead and put whatever toppings I say for the first sandwich on the second and call it a day. Until I ask them what about my second sandwich it has different toppings. then they go and take all the toppings off the first one so neither of us get what we want. This happens over and over so unless you are super specific which doesn't always work. It seems when I want it done correctly I end up having to complain to them that they never do it right."}
{"text":"Been here a few time and always friendly and more importantly good food. If the make you wait to long or mess something up, chances are you get a free cookie or another treat."}
{"text":"I've been here three times.  The food is pretty good but overpriced, but they have never once gotten my order right on the first time.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Have always loved cheba hut....fair prices, and always been consistent...keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Holy smokes! I'm not sure if there are any illegal ingredients in their sandwiches, but I'm addicted and don't care! I wish I lived closer so I could try something besides the White Widow (chicken, bacon, ranch and lots of other fixins that make my mouth happy). Their signature garlic herb bread is insanely delicious and compliments their sandwiches perfectly. My daughter's love the Apollo 13 (think Greek) and the Kali Mist (California Club). Don't let the dive atmosphere and Cheech and Chong mural intimidate you, these folks are nice and take pride in making great sandwiches."}
{"text":"Good food. Fun place. Jamaican red and white widow are the best.
Ordered online twice, both the times they started preparing only after I arrived and asked for it. I arrived by the time as mentioned in the email and they weren't busy."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food. It's a little sloppy but that's ok. Environment is fun and selection of subs is great!"}
{"text":"Everything I have had here is YUM.  I rarely eat bread so when I do it not only has to be good, but very thin....and at Cheba Hut, the bread is just that.    I HIGHLY recommend the White Widow."}
{"text":"The food is good, and if they ever took the orders right it would be even better. Service is incompetent and you can tell that everyone takes their position to heart and comes blazed to work every day. There has yet to be a time where my order was done correctly and the number of times I ordered a \"LOADED KUSH SANDWICH\" and received ONLY BACON ON BREAD has been ridiculous. They will NEVER comp you for their mistakes, instead they will have you come back to the store and prove the mistake or if you had it delivered they will remake it and you have to wait another hour to get your food. Honestly, all in all this is a giant waste of time; they only get the 2 stars because the food is good."}
{"text":"Got the munchies? Best toasted subs in Mesa! If you can dig the stoner ambiance, the atmosphere has such a chill vibe, music that takes you back down memory lane, and the subs that just hit the spot! Cant pass up their fruity rice krispy treats either. HIGHLY recommend their White Widow with easy Shrooms mannnnn!"}
{"text":"It might not be the fastest Sandwich joint in town, but you always get what you order. And it always tastes good. The employees appear to enjoy working there. Good selection of chips and drinks and if you're so inclined, you can get a beer, too.

The decor is pretty fun. Pot themed. It reminds me of any college kids room from the 90s. There is no associated smell, however.

It is a joy to go there and see Natalie college kids, but police officers, EMTs, firefighters, families and working class dudes."}
{"text":"Called in a togo order because I knew they were closing soon the person who answered the phone and told me they don't take phone orders after 11:30 (at 11:32) and that I could come in and get it in person. Entire staff was very rude giving me and my friend dirty looks and telling us we had to get it Togo because they were \"already shut down\" as they are talking about what sandwiches to make for themselves. I tipped 2.00$ after all of this because I felt like such a dick for coming in so late. I told the person taking my order no mayo then literally looked the red curly haired woman in the eyes and asked for no mayo as well. She throws our food on the counter and gives us a dirty look and I get home and see this. This is my first yelp and I'm sorry if this seems exaggerated but seriously fuck this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Every sandwich is great, produce and meat is fresh, and service is perfect. 

They now deliver! And the service is great. They came within the time frame, and he sandwich tasted like I was eating it there. Delivery driver was friendly. Will definitely order from the again! 

Oh and they now have a bar inside the location. This place is definitely upgrading :)"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The sandwiches are always delicious and especially the \"munchies\" like brownies, rice krispy treats and more, and depending on the day, are always something different. The staff is always very friendly and know what they're doing."}
{"text":"La Canna is my favorite! Meaty and juicy! I'm never disappointed by this sandwich. I love it on the herb bread. One day I'll venture to try another. Maybe?!"}
{"text":"I was casually going into by a pinner until I was falsely accused and humiliated by the manager without any evidence. He tried to frame me for a past event which involves stealing the blunt prop in the restaurant. I found his actions highly unprofessional and they were personal and did not need to be taken into the workplace. I do not know what ideas he had wrapped up in his head when he observed me but I was not happy with it and I don't recommend anyone going to that store if you want to be served by some disrespectful ignorant low life of a manager."}
{"text":"Moved out here from Florida a couple months ago. Co worker told me about it, so I had to check it out. Been there a bunch of times already and you should do the same! Four different Kool Aids on fountain, yeah buddy."}
{"text":"The restaurant is marijuana-themed and is located next to several dispenseries which I am not particularly fond of but the sandwiches are exceptional. I will definitely be retuning."}
{"text":"Cheba Hut is a place I love and hate. I love the quality of the sandwiches and the fact they're toasted! They have veggie options and all kinds of sides and unique drinks, and a variety of tasty desserts. I hate how it can be hard to order your food cause the cashier or sandwich maker is high and slow as shit. The weed theme is amusing, but it can only go so far before it affects the quality of the service and the work ethic that a business has. Numerous times I have had rude, stoned jerkoffs answer the phone and treat me like I'm a fellow piece of shit stoner with all the time in the world, which is bullshit. I know other people have had the same problem and the management needs to address this; tell your employees to leave the herbage for their own time, and to bring their A-game to work!"}
{"text":"I absolutly love this place.  I live in Chandler, go to MCC (there is a Cheeba Hut right across the street), but I travel the 20 mins to go to the Tempe store.  The people here are awesome.  They make you feel like a friend, not just a customer.  Everytime I go in the employees introduce themselves, let you take as much time as you need, and will answer 1001 questions without getting impatient.  They know exactly how to make the perfect sandwich.  I tell them to make it how they think its good and they are always excellent.  If you are visiting AZ YOU MUST GO! They not only offer great eats but an aptmosphere you will never forget."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Went here with a friend who lost a bet and had to buy me lunch and have been back several times since.  The people are friendly, and the sandwiches are amazing.  I reccomend the KGB."}
{"text":"I cant get enough...Sandwiches that are  So daaaang goooood, there needs to be more Cheba Huts!!!"}
{"text":"This location is amazing! The sandwiches are great and the customer service is the best I have gotten in an extremely long time!! I have been going to restaurants my whole life and this is the first time I have had a person thank me for my gratuity that I can remember. The girls name is Emily that took my order, she has amazing customer service. On top of all of that, I really like that she took the time to get my order exactly right. I will keep coming back because of her!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this place after a long day at work & school. I was super hungry! Its a small hole in the wall place with stoner decor. U have to be into cannabis culture to appreciate it (i am and I did) the place makes u feel like you're in a Cheech and Chong movie! The dudes behind the counter are friendly and totally cool. On to the food. I had the Afghan blunt its a spicy turkey sub. I have to say that it was nothing special. The bread was kinda dry and the sub was too plain, basically turkey and jalapeño with some lettuce and tomato. It was no better than Subway. I think I prefer Quiznos. I will give it another shot because I really want to like it."}
{"text":"I love these sandwiches!! Toasted and delish. I wouldn't recommend it if you are in a hurry since it takes a little while for the toasting but they are very worth it. I get the Griefo. Don't worry you only feel silly ordering the first time. I love the spring mix lettuce they offer."}
{"text":"I work close to Cheba hut and we frequently order food to go. The food is very good, especially the Jamaican Red sandwich. Delicious, in fact it is the only thing that I get there. The price is a little though, I think around 8-9 dollars for a sub. That has been my biggest gripe. The only other reason I am rating this a 4 star and not 5 is the fact that there delivery isn't the fastest. One time we ordered sandwiches and it took them more than 45 minutes to deliver and we are only a mile away. 

Bottom line though, if you are wanting to great hot sub than you need to check this place out. You won't regret it. Again, get the JAMAICAN RED!!!! You're welcome."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwich. Takes 10 min instead of 5 at subway but that's what it takes. Love that they expanded so there is more room. The staff is pretty friendly and it is clean from what I remember. Love it, gotta start tryin different sandwiches besides the afghan, but it tastes so good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Was my first time trying it, thanks to my gf. The workers are definitely cool and very welcoming! I had the \"Acapulco gold\" sandwich, it was 10000000x better than what I thought.. This is definitely my new fav sandwich spot! Thanks!! You need to open one in the LA area, like Venice beach!!! It would make so much sense and money for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Tastes like a vamped up Quiznos to me. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Worth giving this place another try. Until then, 3 stars remain."}
{"text":"After a hard morning of rock climbing, my buddy and I ventured here to satisfy our sandwich cravings. He was once a student at Glendale Community College which is right across the street from this sandwich shop. As such, I trusted his opinion of the area and had moderate expectations.

I ended up ordering the Jamaican Red sandwich that was recommended by the cashier. The menu describes it as a sandwich construct of grilled chicken breast, green bell peppers, jalapenos, black olives, and cheddar cheese. Top it off with chipotle sauce. Freakin' delicious. A solid sandwich place with some not-so-subtle nods to weed, which is very alright with me!

To conclude, it's a solid sandwich shop. More than that actually. It's a quality sandwich shop with good ingredients, great flavors, and a fun atmosphere! =)

Note: Rumor has it that this place becomes crazy poppin on 4/20 and the lines become super long! But apparently they have a DJ as well for that day...?"}
{"text":"Been going to the one in california since it opened. couldn't be more happy there's one in my home town now. Hands down best subs in town"}
{"text":"Delish!!!! Long time Cheba Hut fan....I miss the Simpson s on TV :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years! It's a little hippie sub shop with funny \"smoking\" names for their subs.  Everything is made fresh and it's always good!"}
{"text":"Since I am writing about subs, I have to include Cheba Hut. I tried it twice and At first, I thought it was 4 stars but then I quickly forgot about it so why 4 stars for a place that did not stay in my mind so I gave it a 3 stars, should be a 3.5. It is an above average place, but the two things I saw that made it sink in the stars was the portion, little meat, maybe 2-3 layers about it covered up wih the cheese melted on it. The bread is okay, but the flavor or lack of was the same as most other places. Nothing really stood out in terms of seasoning or sauces or taste. Don't get me wrong, it is a well done sub, other ingredients are fresh, have cool names but really still the same subs everyone else offers. They are one of the better well done subs, but again, I quickly forgot about it until I was in that part of Mesa and stopped by. It is still a place I would recommend but not a 4 or 5 stars."}
{"text":"Wanna get high!!!  I usually don't...but after eating these sandwiches, I wanted to smoke a fatty so that I could have the munchies so I could eat another sandwich.  

I eat at Cheba Hut on a regular basis, usually get the Midwest Best or the Pakalolo...both sandwiches are awesome.  Staff is very friendly and decorations are straight out of a Cheech and Chong movie... great place to grab lunch."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place after trying to find a place that delivers. I must say at 8 months pregnant I wasn't thrilled waiting 50 minutes for the food to arrive but at least it was worth it!! I had the California club and a goo ball. The club was excellent! The goo ball... let's just say I ate it very quietly and didn't give my 6 year old a bite until she noticed I had dessert. It was so good!! I can envision future trips if nothing else to fill a goo ball craving. Can't day anything about the restaurant itself as I haven't been but the food was delish and had I not ordered right in the middle of lunch hour I'm sure my food would have been delivered faster. All in all I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I think it's fitting to name sandwiches after blunts. Service is quick, decor is entertaining & food is filling. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. The recent remodel really made it look nicer, though more corporate inside. I love the kool aide. Big variety of sandwiches, but my fave thing is the goo ball, a rice krispie treat made from fruity pebbles or cocoa pebbles. YUM!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, great decor and a fantastic sandwich! I've been to this restaurant four times since learning about it a few weeks ago. 

The KGB is my favorite oven-baked sandwich. It's roast beef, loaded with all of the fixings and topped with a touch of  horseradish sauce. At some point, I'll expand my horizons and try another selection from their menu, but alas,  'loyalty' is \"strong with this one.\" Trust me, it is a gift *and* a curse, TBH.

My \"Chicks,\" who are sandwich snobs, have decided that they prefer this establishment over the \"Mainstream Sandwich Pimps\"--and that, is a feat in itself..."}
{"text":"I hate to give 1 star to a place I used to love so much. After a 2 year break from this place due to finding a beard (or at least I hope that was the source) hair in my sandwich, I tried again. Guess what: ANOTHER BEARD HAIR!  So now I'm done forever. Men who work in food service should be required to either shave or wear some sort of face hair net. It's disgusting"}
{"text":"Went there towards closing time. They were out of some toppings so I asked for extra guacamole. The guy sounded understanding and loaded the sub without asking me any questions. When I got home, I noticed that my bread was not toasted and was drenched in a dairy based sauce I did not ask for. Had to throw it out because I cannot have dairy."}
{"text":"Great sandwich experience, the food was really good and fresh I had the 5-0 on  garlic bread. The staff was friendly and even came around to ask how everything is. Can't wait too go back and try the Kush."}
{"text":"I have been coming to the Mesa location for 9 years they have amazing, wonderful, fresh food! The staff is always friendly and helpful, it's nice to go where everyone knows your name!"}
{"text":"Ooooh how I love me some cheba hut.  Walk in and see all the hippie stoner employees smiling and joking getting ready to make me a bomb ass sandwich.  Do they know how they make my day?  
Everything I've had is great.  The 5-0 is particularly delicious (a take on an Italian) and the skywalker is even better.  Pepperoni and ham with pineapple and jalapenos and cream cheese......might be the best sandwich I've ever had.  Honorable mention to the AK 47 and the Panama red.
Last time I came in they had Disney radio on.  It was 11 pm.  I love them.
They also have beer!  I don't really drink but it's an upgrade."}
{"text":"Small chain sub shop with a weed theme.  They toast the sandwiches, and boy, are they good.  They have something for everyone-whether you want a plainer sub or a fancier one.  I always get the Five-O(ham, salami, pepperoni, bacon, and proscuitto), although one day I must try other sandwiches.  However, service is slow after you order.  You also don't get to see them assemble your sandwich, which is something I like.  They have the best sandwiches, but I really wished it didn't take them +15 minutes to do that."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, the garlic herb bread is amazing.  Not'chos made with Doritos, tasty!  And the PB&J rice crispy treats..."}
{"text":"I had a blunt today. First time here. It was a good sandwich. I got in early so beat the lunch line. I liked the atmosphere, but the table was dirty from the previous customer. Problem was though that all the booth's were dirty (table or seat)."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and saw a lot of familiar faces who worked there. Def going to come back the subs were daaank!"}
{"text":"Super friendly employees! Super yummy subs! Tasty treats! AND THEY HAVE KOOLAID! Try the Skywalker or the Kali Mist!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The white widow is the best! Haven't tried a sub here I didn't like. Ordering seems to have changed a bit where you order the fixings up front instead of being called to the counter and choosing. I like it the former way but its not a big deal as long as the person taking your order has a good memory and can list off the fixings. 

Loooove the strawberry kiwi kool-aid! The munchies are also delicious and will make you feel 10 years old again.  The subs are so filling that munchies are good for later."}
{"text":"So bomb every time I come. Staff is always super friendly and nice! Love all of the little touches they add to everything. White Widow is so good! Tried the rice crispy treats this time! Would recommend. Also have had delivery is always hot and fast. Love this place"}
{"text":"If you have the option to go after lunch then do it, but avoid this place at all cost during lunch hours like 11am to 2pm. They are normally good outside of those hours but I wanted to try them before work which I got there at around 1:45pm it was super busy, I had time but I've notice others were upset, especially a family that had like 4 teenagers and 2 parents. When I got in they were having so much issues at the register ordering, and this guy with glasses was laughing and joking around making mistakes which I guess he thought was cool to do. But they made soooooo many mistakes that it seemed everyone's sandwiches kept sending back, which delays the ones coming out. It was a mess I never seen it this bad, till I went during lunch. Just avoid during lunch hours, this place is still pretty good and all."}
{"text":"Dude this place was amazing!! I went there a couple days back and the dude at the desk was super chill. I will definitely be back! My sandwich did fall apart a little bit but it was still really good!! The customer service was great and he explained everything well. Sandwich was also very fresh. Could be a little cheaper but it was still worth it!"}
{"text":"As a dude who loves Sandwiches, this is the place that made me love sandwiches in the first place. I love spicy food and I can eat the Jamaican Red at least once a week. Oh, that's right. I always do. Add some Mountain Dew and the best Rice Krispie Treats, outside of my own, and you've got my favorite sandwich place ever.

I also hear the pizza sub is good. I just can't be bothered not to have a Jamaican Red."}
{"text":"Great subs and customer service. Took a little while to get our food but was worth the wait. Only tried one sub so far but will be definitely back"}
{"text":"This place is mediocre....I would even venture out there (no mans land) to say this place is the equivalent to a poseur stoner. 

everybody knows that true potheads only eat/order/work at SilverMine Subs (aka The *GoldMine*).

-This is by no means a paid advertisement for Silver Mine Subs \"Dig in at the Mine\" Sub Shop & Eatery \"We Deliver til' 3am on weeknights!!!\""}
{"text":"The best sub sandwiches on the planet! No comparison at all. They're open late too so when we have a late night a tasty meal is not far away. Plus they deliver if you're in their range.
Their subs are toasted and that makes them extra yummy. They use great ingredients and their bread is wonderful, especially their garlic-herb bread, it's delish! They also have a fine selection of made fresh daily desserts, the kind that will satisfy your munchies.
An eclectic menu, fine friendly staff and a humorous decor combine to make Cheba Hut our favorite sub shop."}
{"text":"Darn it! I have been going to this place for years and it seems that they have diminished their seving size. Bummer, time for the other guys."}
{"text":"I love Cheba Hut and always will. So many good toasted sandwiches... My favorites are the Spicy Widow (White Widow with the Jamaican Red meat), Afghani and The Kind, but there are so many more to choose from!

Something about the bread or the toasting... these sandwiches are so damn delicious."}
{"text":"I do not recommend them to anyone.
WoW the long wait for my sandwhich.
Oh no garlic bread ran out. Spring lettuce ran out. Ok so I order a sanwhich even when there out of some items I guess I can understand but isnt that your business to have enough supplys. So I order my food that takes for ever and when I go to get the sandwhich the girl drops my sanwhich on the ground. Lazy stoner girl get off the pot and do your job properly I will not be back I use to rave about this place over rated the employees a waste of brain cells need to find another job."}
{"text":"A sandwich place is just a sandwich place, right? How much can they vary? Bread, check. Stuff that goes on bread, check. Drinks to go with the sandwiches, check. 

Fine. But these sandwiches are REALLY good, okay? \"Counter-culture\" affiliation aside, these people make some really damn good food in this shop. I had the Kali Mist which is their version of the Club and the first thing I thought was, \"RIP lipstick\" when they brought it out. Just the right amount of turkey (I really hate when there's too much turkey on a sandwich. It's a thing) and chipotle mayo. The only thing I would have changed is the bacon to a thick cut but that's being nitpicky.

My husband, the vegetarian, had the Humboldt and it seemed like I blinked and he finished it. Safe to say he enjoyed it as well. Oh, and we started with the pretzels and honey mustard, at the recommendation of the super nice guy who took our order. I would go back just for those. 

Let's talk about the iced tea. I'm really picky about my iced tea. Ignore the plain one and go straight to the flavored one. You don't even need to add a lot of sugar to it. I would also go back just for the tea, if we're being honest here. And why wouldn't I be? 

So yeah, even if you're not into the theme, go here for the food and the very friendly service. You won't regret it!

UPDATE: My husband liked it so much he went back the NEXT DAY for lunch. Seriously, that good."}
{"text":"My new Tempe addiction! I recently moved less than a mile to this place and have been 4 times. I have tried different sandwiches each time and they are always perfect! So far my favorite is the wake n bake. It has bard boiled eggs on it which add such nice texture and flavor. The staff here is also very friendly and attentive. And who doesn't want a nice glass of kool aid to go with your \"blunt\"?!!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. 
They have great \"toasted\" subs. My boyfriend gets a blunt (large) chicken, bacon, ranch on garlic bread and i get a pinner (medium) Apollo 13 which is a greek sandwich. Make sure to add bacon and mayo though! 
It's kind of pricey but they're not just basic sandwiches. We usually spend $25 on food then go to the bar and buy a drink. 
Yum!!"}
{"text":"The first couple of times I ate here I wasn't sure why people were always so crazy for this place. It's been about two years since my last visit and in the past couple of months I've already been here like three times and wanted to go back more. I've decided that it's all about what you order; for example the first time I went I probably felt overwhelmed with all the choices and decided to go for something really plain like turkey with hardly any toppings, have fun! Their menu has a wide variety of yummy sandwiches and lots of new tastes to try. Also, don't be afraid to speak up. I was a little disappointed by the lack of lettuce and veggies on one of my veggie sandwiches but I also didn't pay attention. Now I ask for lots of lettuce and they're happy to make it the way I like. They make their breads fresh and they have garlic-herb bread that has lots of flavor. I won't order a sandwich from there without a side of ranch dressing. I am a picky ranch eater...I hate mayonnaise so I am always super careful that ranch doesn't taste or resemble mayo. I usually like restaurant mayo that is a little more runny in consistency with lots of flavor. They have the best home made ranch dressing here! Pair it with the garlic-herb bread and your sandwich is going to be booming in flavor. OMG! Wipe...sorry I just started to drool a bit. Service is good...everyone runs at the same chill pace which seems to go well with the theme of this restaurant. My current favorite is the Humboldt sandwich...I get the Pinner (8\") but I swear some days I am so hungry I think I'm going to order the Blunt (12\")...maybe someday soon. All sandwiches get toasted. Okay so toppings: Guacamole, sprouts, lettuce/spring mix, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, black olives (I get mine w/o), cucumbers, pickles, your choice of cheese (I get Swiss), with their house goodies (EVOO, vinegar, herb mixture on top). Now that I found my sandwich, I crave it all the time and can't wait for my next visit. Oh, be sure to check their daily specials too! If you're lucky enough to be in their delivery area...well, darn you then! :-)"}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area, and I thought I would get a quick bite to eat and have a drink one evening.  The place is an easy going down to earth dive.  I had The Kind sandwich and it was actually very good. I was then recommended to try the Root Beer alcoholic drink boy...that was amazing with a real kick!  I will definitely be going there again for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I had a sandwich with ham and pineapple. I believe it's the first one on their menu, something like kolapaca or so.

It was pretty decent. Good amount of food, good taste.

It was kind of pricey, for 2 subs, 2 drinks, chips and a treat almost 20.

They place could be also a little cleaner. 

I wouldn't drive more than 2 miles to go there and I wouldn't crave it either. 

If you're in the neighborhood, it might worth a try. If i would live around, I would order delivery service once in a while, though. Their statement: \"If you're high, we'll fly\""}
{"text":"this is my favorite restaurant of all time, and they finally opened one in vegas, aka: game over 

white widow blunt on garlic herb bread with kool aid on tap... heaven on earth

my grandma likes the theme too lol"}
{"text":"Last night I finally ventured into the vaunted, esteemed, and very hazy Cheba Hut, and, well, what can I say. Having lived in SF, I've been inside every head shop up and down Haight Street and I can assure you that none are as remotely inyoface about the sultry siren call of MaryJane as this randomly-placed-in-a-Tempe-stripmall-restaurant is. Impressive feat, that.

I walked up to the register. 

Friendly girl with heavy eyelids and an \"I Love Weed\" tshirt smiles and asks me slowly, \"Heyyyyyy....you wanna....sandwich?\"

Oh, twist my arm, sure I'll have a sandwich, if you put it that way. 

Looking at the sandwich menu was good for a laugh. Actually the entire place is good for a laugh, including the giant blunt overlording everything from the top of the back wall. I settled on one of the veggie sandwiches, the Majic Mushroom (sliced portabella, teriyaki sauce, pineapples) on whole wheat. And, sure, I'll have one of these here Cocoa Krispie Treats right next to the register, because why not? I'll pretend I have the munchies tonight. 

It took a while for my sandwich to appear, and I wasn't sure if it was due to technical or human difficulties, but no matter, because the sandwich was tasty and fresh and good. A toasted sub that doesn't sit like a rock in my stomach, which is how I usually feel post-Quizno's. However, whether it was good enough for how much it cost, I was still trying to debate in my head.

And as I ate, I got a little depressed, because I didn't recognize any of the stoner-friendly tracks playing on the soundsystem. What is all of this new stuff? Who are they? Where's the Cypress Hill of yore? Where's the Pharcyde? Where's Massive Attack vs. Mad Professor? Where's Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon or Pato Banton pleading The Man to legalize it? I feel very un-with-it, all of a sudden, but all of the visual hotboxing still ended up leaving me in a good, albeit extremely sedate mood. 

And, in the end, all I can say is, like, word. 

Let's get together and feel alright."}
{"text":"So tonight I tried cheba hut with a friend, let me tell you, it was great. Entering into the place, the most random music playing ever was Christmas music, it wasn't annoying but hilarious. The guy was very friendly and helped me out with my order, I got the magic mushroom with chicken and fully loaded, all the veggies they offered, with honey mustard. 
  It was amazing, I forgot what my friend got, but he enjoyed his sandwich to. The employees were very friendly, I had a smile on my face the whole time there. I highly recommend this place. Its theme is stoner themed but don't let that stop you from trying this place."}
{"text":"Another welcome addition to Mad-Town.  Whether or not you indulge in the Doobie-wah-Kenobi, Cheba hut will not disappoint!  I had a chance to mow down on a variety of items during their grand opening this past week.

While I may have been skeptical at first glance, overall, I was totally impressed with the whole package.  First off, the subs were excellent.  Appropriately sized in either Nug, Pinner or Blunt, I opted for a nug of White Widow and a pinner of La Canna.  The White Widow was a ridiculously delicious combo of Chicken, bacon and mushrooms slathered in ranch dressing.  Righteous.  The La Canna was  a classic take on an Italian deli sub with salami and ham.  All in all, the subs were fresh and tasty.  As well, I respected their heavy-handed selection of veggie subs...so if you prescribe to such a diet, you'll have a hell of a selection in comparison with other comparable sub shops.  I would be remise to exclude the wild selection of baked goods.  From hemp brownies to crazy cereal-laden marshmallow treats, they're not to be missed.   Add a couple of brews to the mix (yup, they have a bar!) and you're all set.  

On a side note, the staff was super attentive and proactively helped me pimp my sub out...cheers to that!  I will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"I love coming here and bringing friends. Everyone loves it as much as I do. It's a great friendly atmosphere and the food is amazingly yummy. Oh and they have koolaid!! Def try this place!"}
{"text":"This is honestly the best cheba hut location near me I had a bad experience late tonight at the Mesa location and so I decided to come to the university location in Tempe and as always they turned my frown upside down amazing customer service here love this place thanks guys you're amazing!!! And my subs are always bomb"}
{"text":"Order twice in the past two weeks and i completely loved it!! Had it delivered to my apartment and it was quick. The girl that answers the phone is awesome. Very positive vibe!! Love it :)"}
{"text":"Don't forget the green! 

I am never disappointed when I come here. Yeah I know the wait can be long, and the service can take a while... But it's definitely worth the wait.
I love the ambiance of this place, it's fun and creative, not to mention ...green. haha. 

I usually get the Griefo, with honey mustard and all the veggies. or the Thai Stick, \"naked\"... The white widow is delicious too. 

Their \"munchies\" are the best of the best, my favorite is the one made with fruity pebbles for the one with peanut butter captain crunch. 
I know I'll always be a fan of this place. I just love it. :D"}
{"text":"This was my go to spot when I was working in Denver. The Vegas location tastes exactly the same and the music selection is always good. I always order the Kali Mist on wheat with sprouts and it's consistently amazing."}
{"text":"Fantastic!

Feels like a beach bar somewhere on the Southern California coast. Great sandwiches, and a very cool vibe.

The Kali Mist is my current fave, with chicken, bacon, and LOADS of veggies. Get it on a grilled garlic bun for a killer meal.

If you're lucky enough to get Mondo as your bartender, you'll be well cared for. Great guy. Super friendly and fun.

Yes, the theme is \"marijuana\" - but don't let that stop you if you don't partake. 

However; if you DO indulge, there's a dispensary pretty much next door. It's a pretty fine business pairing, I must say."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Will be going back. The person taking our order was great very friendly and helpful. Good vibe if your into tattoos and piercings and in general not the norm vibe. What's the fun in being like everyone Else. Food was exceptional so much Beyond subway is not even funny and no Jerrod to worry about. In and out of there in less that a half hour but we did go at 11:30 but when we were leaving there was a lot of people coming in.  I had a vegan friend tell me about this so there are those options there for you none animals eating people."}
{"text":"Cheba Hut, you're right around the corner from my house, but if you weren't, I'd drive to you. I love you. I don't care what other people say about you- take all of my stars. You're worth it.

Cheba Hut seriously has the best sub sandwich game. The food is phenomenal, it's never taken more than 10 minutes (in store), and everyone is always friendly."}
{"text":"Damn it-I'm hooked! Better than Subway hands down! You got to go here! I am truly addicted"}
{"text":"This place is addicting-seriously.  I can't get enough. Won't even go to Subway any more after trying the food here. GOOOO NOW you will be happy"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and it was good. I had an AK-47 \"pinner\" which is the medium size, roast beef, mushroom, and red onion sandwich with Au jus dip, and it was pretty tasty. The atmosphere is laid back, cool pieces of art to look at, and polite (and dare I say handsome) employees."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Cali mist cus of the jalapeños and can't forget about the peanut butter jelly sandwich"}
{"text":"This place is a gem in Phoenix!! Highly recommended! Food is delicious, and the service was amazing."}
{"text":"My new favorite sandwich place in town! 
Large extensive menu with some tasty munchies. 
Try the Kali Mist and the pretzel bites"}
{"text":"Although I don't make it to Cheba Hut often because of the distance, I enjoy it whenever I'm in the area.  The first time I went in the guy was super nice and answered any questions I had.  The food was delicious and the place was clean.  I've gone there twice on 4/20 because they always have a deal going and despite the longer line it's never taken too long to get my food.  Also a bonus that they have vegan/vegetarian alternatives, it was actually my vegan friend who introduced us to Cheba Hut.  Her sub was surprisingly flavorful (for no meat) compared to most of the food she had us try."}
{"text":"Amazing place to go if you're in the mood for hot sandwiches. I love the la Cana, Better served hot and in house!"}
{"text":"way better then subway let me tell you I get the Apollo 13 witch is like a Greek chicken salad I get the garlic bread witch make brings it all to gather and they have kool-aid the service is OK the only thing is it takes for ever for them to make a sandwich 15 to 25 min. if your in the store and for delivery 1HR to 130 I delivered pizza for years 45 to 1HR OK pizza that's way longer to cook but still worth the wait"}
{"text":"This place has great toasted subs. I thought it was a Hawaiian restaurant for the longest time so I never stopped in until I heard from a friend. Prices are nice, only $5 for my sandwich and $10 for my boyfriends. The portions are huge for me so I always get the 4\" and I'm super full. The 12\" (blunt) is an enormous amount of food. I've never sat at the bar here but it's always got a crowd of people with a really nice vibe. I love the open design with half the bar on the patio and half inside. 

The employees are all super nice and fast. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"This place is super clever and delicious.  It's a staple for everyone I work with and every sandwich I've had is yummy! Atmosphere is funny, the employees seem like they fit right in to the laid back, go with the flow, stoner attitude. They're friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch because I was told by a coworker that the restaurant was \"interesting\". I asked about the food and he described the food as meh.  I decided to try it anyway.  

I ordered the Humboldt on garlic bread for pick up.  The food was ready when I got there and the staff was very friendly.  The restaurant is definitely interesting and fun.  I was surprised to find they have a bar.  The place, including the restrooms is clean and neat. 

I was pretty excited to try the sandwich.  I was disappointed with the sandwich.  It contained very little guacamole and so the sandwich was very dry. I was not very impressed w the food.  I don't recommend this sandwich 

This was the only time I've been here.  I suspect that the hot sandwiches will be a lot better.  I definitely plan to go back and try other sandwiches."}
{"text":"dude seriously? even better to the ones in Tucson! had a great time.. chill music extra gucamole no problem.. the best avocados ever!"}
{"text":"Have loved this place since I was 14 years old and an avid pothead. Nowadays I can't smoke, but this place will still be the best munchie cure on this side of the Valley!"}
{"text":"Usually I'm pretty happy with this location but, tonight just sucked to put it frankly. I placed my order online as usual. When I got in I saw something that said they were out of pickles so I asked the cashier if they had enough to put on my sandwich and he said no. So I asked for a discount and he looked at me like I was stupid. You provide your phone number during checkout for a reason right? If you're out of something give the customer a call and let them know. When I got home the Jamaican red that I ordered had no chipotle mayo or red sauce which makes the Jamaican red what it is. To say the least I don't feel like these sandwiches were worth 20 dollars. I'll probably end up calling in tomorrow to let them know that my order wasn't right and let them know their closing shift isn't doing what they need to do.


Update: The manager Zack gave me a call next day and was very kind. He didn't need to offer me a discount for my next visit but he did which was appreciated. I understand that people may be new and it was end of shift on a Sunday but I am glad that they took the time to call and take my feedback about how they handle online orders. Thank you Zack for being so professional even in the world of blunts and pinners!"}
{"text":"Okay so you've probably had Subway or Jimmy Johns, but Cheba Hut's signature \"toasted\" subs are next level. If you're looking for a quick fix to your munchies or just an amazing dining experience check out cheba hut!

Food- 10/10 
 We tried two different subs each was outstanding. Not a complaint to be found. For dessert we weren't dissapointed when the first thing we saw as we walked in was a wide variety of rice crispy treats. Great touch guys can't wait to see what additions you add to the cereal treat line up

Customer Service- - 10/10 
Great bunch of staff!  

Overall this is a must do dining experience ! Check them out for a great meal and a great time"}
{"text":"This place is so good. I have never been inside. However i have ordered through Door Dash to my office 3 times now. Last time the driver forgot my chips and drink, so i called the restaurant. The manager, Brayton, said next time i places an order i could get my drink and chips. So a week later i placed another order, called them and they included my missing items from the week before. They are so nice and charming on the phone. Customer service is on point. Even tho a third party company forgot my items, Cheba Hut made sure i was a satisfied customer. Thank you for being so awesome!"}
{"text":"I have had their delivery for years, and it's finally become inedible. The sub quality has gone downhill, and the employees who take the orders over the phone do not listen. Multiple times I've had the wrong sub order delivered to me, and although I'm ultimately given the correct sub, it's taken 3 times as long as it should (and nasty customer service from the employees). After our most recent failure trying to order from Cheba Hut, I can say with certainty that I won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Cali mist blunt and pretty nuggets with honey mustard. Yea man, yea. I just want to know one thing, who's comin with me man? Who's comin with me? Love you guys!"}
{"text":"Easily the best subs I have ever had. My favorite is the Thai stick (teriyaki chicken) loaded up on the garlic herb bread. Great environment with lots of friendly people. Plus the have kool aid at the fountain..."}
{"text":"Been coming here a long.. long time. If you want a general idea of what your walking into.. think a hippy subway haha! Everyone's laid back, the food is great and there are nothing but good vibes man, that's slang for great atmosphere haha. But if you cant decide on which sandwich you want you can ask if you can blend the two. I personally like the white widow and the Jamaican red.. so I get the Jamaican widow, best of both worlds!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Very nice staff! I asked the cashier to pick a veggie sandwich for me and he did and also added his little spin on it.  Seriously the best sandwich I have had!"}
{"text":"I used to live across from this place, and it's been nothing short of entertaining. I kid you not one time I looked out my window, and women in bikinis were wrestling in cheese wiz. Every time I'm there I enjoy myself, as the staff is really laid back and friendly. 

Their witty sub sizes - nug, pinner, and blunt - are aptly named for the amount that you get. I usually order the 5-0 with all the pig: bacon, salami, ham, prosciutto, and pepperoni. My fav topping is the giardinera pepper. They allow you to stuff the subs full of toppings, so it's a super filling meal. 

Don't forgot that this place also has beer on tap! My friends and I used to frequent their mini bar for a quick drink before going out. Keep on keepin on, cheba!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich 'joint.'  Loads of options for sandwiches ranging from basic to truly unique culinary deliciousness. I had the KGB...roast beef, peppers, mushrooms, Swiss.  very good!!  Atmosphere is cool and service is good.  Will definitely be back when in the area."}
{"text":"Stoners and sobers alike should come here for the great sandwiches. Liked the fact that they incorporate vegan cookies and other options for diverse tastes and diets. Enjoyed my sandwich while getting entertained by the decor."}
{"text":"Used to come here with my dad every weekend, this is a very special place to me. Now I come here with my hubby, because we live dangerously close. The white widow is soooo good. Everything is good. The munchies are the perfect way to end the meal, and you can't forget to get a glass of kool aid. The music is usually really good and the environment is always ~chill~ make sure you prepare to come here, the blunt is a big sandwich, so work up a appetite ;)"}
{"text":"Found this spot on Yelp while getting an oil change. We had a great time enjoying a few cold ones and delicious Sandwiches! The bread is so fresh and I especially loved their vegetarian options!!! One of the best subs I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Another 5 star rating. The concept, the subs, the cookies... my goodness the cookies .... everything is great!! The serving sizes are HUGE!! I order the pinner (I believe that's what it's called) and couldn't finish it. My mate ordered the blunt size and we wasted a whole half of sub. It was just wayyyyy too big and whichever sandwich he ordered had NBQ sauce on it, a lot of it so if you don't eat it almost immediately you'll be left with soggy bread! He also ordered extra meat on his sandwich and I understand why. I'm so sorry I can't remember the names of the subs but I ordered what would be equivalent to an Italian sub. The flavors were so dern good but the meat?? Idk where it went lol 
I'd definitely order it again but with extra meat. My sandwich reminded me of a potbelly sandwich honestly. The next time I visit I'll be sure to get an original sandwich of some sort. 

The cookies!! Holy moly!! The cookies are insanely good. We ordered one cookie to share while we were waiting for our food, after eating that one cookie we ordered 2 more to take home!!"}
{"text":"Great tasting sandwiches, kool-aid on tap, and munchies (sweets). On top of that, they welcome everyone with a smile."}
{"text":"I order the ak47 here and it's always killer. The au ju makes it 2 xs better. The veggie sandwiches are good too and the names are always so fun to look at. They have a good number of sandwiches to choose from and of course you can wash it down with homemade kool-aid just like high school again!"}
{"text":"Let's Put It This Way, The White Widdow Nug Was So Amazing That Immediately After Finishing My Sub I Came On Here To Tell You How Amazing It Is , every bite I took made me ask myself why didn't I get a blunts worth instead of just a nug , you can never have enough this sub was given by the gods AN GET A COOL AID ! Truly A Work Of Art"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, great beer, great service. Definitely a plus that everything is weed themed. Awesome atmosphere as well. If I lived in LV I'd be there weekly."}
{"text":"The food and the service were both amazing! I had the Kali Mist and my husband had the white widow. Both were so delicious, the kali mist had fresh jalapeños so it really gives it a kick, the chicken in the white widow was seasoned perfectly and it was fresh. Overall best damn sandwiches I've had. The manager was training new employees and everything was still perfect. He checked in with customers and ensured the quality and service of the food were exceptional. I have nothing but good things to say about this place. Sorry no pictures because I devoured my sandwich and some of my husbands.
Tip: get your sandwich fully loaded and get at least the pinner size otherwise you'll be left wanting more."}
{"text":"Love this place for a good sandwich! The afghani is my favorite! The atmosphere is layed back"}
{"text":"Cheba Hut is amazing! There are so many selections! I love how there's more than just one veggie sandwich option. They are sooooo generous with the veggies too!! Today I got the power plant which was smothered in their yummy hummus. Usually they're pretty busy so I try to go during an off peak time so I don't wait too long. Either way it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I love cheeba hut. This location is right by my work and I've been eating here every few weeks for over a year. They have never once made a mistake on my order. Sandwiches are always delicious. I've ordered carry-out, delivery, and dined in and always have a good experience. I would highly recommend Cheeba Hut, they have the best sandwiches and service in the area."}
{"text":"I was visiting AZ from VA and my best friend raved about this place. \"we HAVE to eat at this place while you're here to visit!\" she said to me cause she k ow I'm a foodie, we both are. Well, I was very disappointed. I ordered three 4\" subs, the Notchos, and the pretzel bites. My sub order was the French dip, tuna salad, and ham and pineapple. I didn't get any au jus for my dip sub. I didn't even get the ham and pineapple and I got two 4\" tuna salad subs. My Notchos got replaced with cheese garlic bread. The food was not up to party with how she raved about it a D the staff wasn't able to even make my order correctly... Disappointed, but I will give it another shot next time I'm in town because 1. I'm not a jerk 2. That hame and pineapple sub looked yummy."}
{"text":"Toasted subs oh my. Wanted to try the pastrami and they were out. Bummer. Ordered the white widow, chips and drink for $10. No complaints."}
{"text":"Staff and service was great. Sandwich was not so great. I was fairly hungry and ordered the \"pizza\" sandwich. It was basically a few slices of italian meats and some cheese in a bun. Would hardly constitute the price that I paid for it (like 8 bucks give or take). I heard good things about Cheba from being in Denver but this was pretty disappointing and there are far more better options in Madison when it comes to spending that amount of money for sandwiches or even anything else. 

The redeeming factor was that I also bought the cinnamon toast crunch rice crispie. It's pretty dank."}
{"text":"awesome! friendly staff, they serve tang  & kool aid, gotta love it!!"}
{"text":"Great Sandwiches! Great desserts! They have the the best fruity pebble krispy treat i have ever had! Great Price! I LOVE Cheba Hut! I have never left disappointed!I am a Life long customer!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and saw a parade of people with brown paper bags emerging from one of the store fronts. I tracked it down to CHEBA HUT.   It was 420 and the place was packed.   Their menu consists of sandwiches and salads. I decided to try a sandwich called the Apollo 13. It was grilled chicken with salad greens, kalamata olives, feta cheese, and greek dressing. You get ur choice of type of bread and size of sandwich. 
I expected the sandwich to be amazing but it wasn't. It was just ok. The chicken was not grilled properly-- not a char in sight. It needed that. The chicken needed more seasoning as well. I would not order it again. However, since they have so many options i will give them another try."}
{"text":"Cheba Hut has delicious sub sandwiches. If you get your sandwich on any other bread than Garlic Herb, you're not living up your full Cheba experience. I get the White Widow (Chicken/bacon/mushroom/ranch), loaded up with veggies and their house dressing. They have different sizes of sandwich for the snack appetite of the nug (4\") to pinner (8\") to the starving side of the blunt (12\"), if you haven't already guessed this is a weed themed sandwich shop, and don't be put off by the names if thats not your style. These are amazing sandwiches. I also love the cereal bars. The only thing is they take a while to make your sandwich (probably only because they make it with love) and their delivery service isn't that great so maybe think twice before ordering for delivery. But a minor bump in the road. This is another one of my go to places-lunch, dinner, or late night"}
{"text":"I looked up whether the bread was vegan online and it said the wheat and white were. When I came in the guy said \"I don't think any of our breads are vegan\" and didn't offer to check. Idk if it's just this location, but even subway has vegan bread.. come on. Get with it Cheba Hut!!!"}
{"text":"The munchies are delicious. My favorite sandwich is the Midwest best, I order it on Italian herb bread and I ask for mixed greens instead of lettuce. So delicious! Ask for mayo and mustard on the side because if you don't, they tend to put a little too much on the sandwich. It's definitely a great place to go sit down and eat at with a small group of friends. The staff is always very nice."}
{"text":"I've never been to the Tempe location but I love everything I have ever received at the Dobson location. When I walked in the first thing I noticed was that it was warm and although it was very busy the kitchen seemed chaotic and messy. When I approached the counter to order a flustered employee explained their systems were down and they had to manually type in all card information. I didn't mind I was in no rush. 

I ordered the Kali Mist sub and a drink. I'm not sure if that was a meal or anything but I didn't receive chips in which I'm pretty sure I paid for. The employee was very flustered with the payment machine so the minute she finished with my card she handed me the table sign and rushed off. We sat down and at first the place seemed dirty but I quickly realized there was only one employee out cleaning all the tables eagerly and checking up on customers. 

That was a comforting feeling because I was afraid this location would be like that all the time. Another employee walked by and I asked her about my meal and If it's chips and a drink and she seemed confused by my question and told me to ask the employee who rang me out and walked away. Well that employee wasn't out on the floor anymore so I didn't bother. Customer service seemed a bit off but oh well. The amazing tasting sub made up for it. If you order the Kali Mist beware. It has lots of fresh jalapeños so you're in for some kick. Beware if you don't like it that way."}
{"text":"This place is super cool!!  I love the positive vibe and great food plus they have beers on tap!!!"}
{"text":"Me and the boyfriend wanted a quick bit and just randomly stoped  here . Great atmosphere! Have all fun things in store to look at . I got the white widow and I do recommend !"}
{"text":"I love this place, just across the street from my work, I go here alot!!! The sandwich's here are AMAZING!!! The only complaint is the wait and delivery time is LONG!!!

try the white widow or tia stick!!!"}
{"text":"This is how a sandwich should be made.  Amazing bread, great balance of meats and fresh veggies.  I had the Cali Mist and it was delicious and substantial. Cant wait to go back and sample some more. I highly recommend Cheba Hut."}
{"text":"Obviously this place caters to a certain crowd that gets munchies at all times of the day and night.  If you need more clarification, msg me.  But the subs are fantastic, almost as good as subs from back home in Jersey, almost.

The subs are fresh and stuffed with everything you want.  I've been here many times and the only negative is that the staff is sometimes a little slow.  But since I'm usually there after drinking (I'm not the DD), it doesn't bother me much.

I would recommend this place as a decent choice for late night fare, way ahead of going to Dennys.  It definitely is an adult friendly place, leave your brats in the trunk."}
{"text":"Ordered the tuna sub,  appreciated it not having celery. The line to order was super long and took just as long to get the sandwich.  All in all a good sandwich although the tuna was a bit dry,  the bread and toppings were good.  I would try to come here at non peak times,  and pre-order online.  Love the environment in the store and the music was cool."}
{"text":"Cool little place with great options for vegetarians. There is also a cute bar with good drinks."}
{"text":"Never had a bad eating experience at Cheba Hut! The food is Delicious, and the subs are TOASTED... Yummm!!! a must-try if you are new to Mesa or if you've just never been to Cheba Hut before!"}
{"text":"I love the decor and vibe of the store, the sandwiches are pretty good too. I was in the mood for a chicken and ranch and I must say it was perfect. The menu was pretty extensive as well, which is great for someone who doesn't really partake in beef or pork. They also have a PB & J! Which I love to see. Only four stars though because I wasn't a huge fan of their drinks, but waters there for a reason right?"}
{"text":"I'm not a stoner but I love the motif of this establishment.  Let's start with the food... it was FREAKING FANTASTIC!!!  Let's talk about trying to buy a sandwich in Tempe after 3 on a Sunday...  I think it's awesome that the only freaking place that has the work ethic to be open was the sandwich shop with the stoner philosophy.  

But it's just a philosophy inside there were many hardworking people making great sandwiches.  They were an absolute machine of productivity.  We got three different sandwiches The Humbolt for the pickiest vegetarian I've ever met and she loved it.  The AK-47 for the woman whose had the best french dip sandwiches in five different states and even take out she was blown away by it.  And I had the White Widow and after a day of eating noting but a yogurt all day was the most flavorful toasted chicken-bacony extravaganzaa I could hope for.  

Cannot recommend this place \"highly\" enough.  But seriously you will not be disappointed. ."}
{"text":"I freakin LOVE this place! I am not a huge smoker but I love the references... I almost died laughing at the ice cube reference... I am corny. I know.

The sandwich was good, I also got a brownie. I'm not a sandwich person so I couldn't go into detail about it but I do know it was good. My BF introduced me to this place because he used to eat here when he was at ASU. 

Great place!"}
{"text":"First time coming here... Very interesting theme for a restaurant but I appreciated the incororations of their theme in every aspect of their food and place! Talk about all or nothing

Came with a couple of friends that come here more often than I do and they said it's becoming more modernized and \"clean\" lol... Not necessarily a bad thing but yea I could understand his concern of the place losing its character...

Anyways tried a nug 4inch sandwich with garlic herb and white widow..,

It was... Okay... Not bad but nothing extraordinary..,

Soda sucked tho lol...my Dr. Pepper was watered down

I'm glad I got to try this place tho!"}
{"text":"So happy there is a Cheba Hut in Las Vegas! I had one in my home town in Albuquerque and would go all the time. Cheba Hut has delicious subs and other tasty made from scratch munchies. The menu and atmosphere has a friendly 420 theme and it conveniently located next to a dispensary. The staff are fast and friendly. We took a staff's recommendation on a Sub and it was such a good pick. I highly recommend this place. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"mmmmmmmmm I am SO glad I finally made it to Cheba Hut!  I had heard so much about it and was super glad to finally get a taste of it myself.  

First of all, walking in to the place is already setting the mood for a great restaurant.  Lots of random stuff all over the walls, lots of hippie constitutional rights stuff, lots of stickers and colors and things to see, and Family Guy playing on the TV.  Perfect!  

The workers are all super chill and nice and take pride in making their sandwiches right and making the customer happy.  They were understaffed that evening and they told us so, just so we know that it'll take a bit more time (even with the sign that says perfection is an art so it'll be a miracle if you get your sandwich in under 5 minutes, or something like that), AND they had no rice krispy treats...at the moment.  

I got The Bomb, pinner style, on the garlic bread and it was awesome.  I kept it simple with just cheese, onions, and parmesan (although I realized after the fact that pepperoncinis would be amazing on it).  It was probably the best meatball sub I've had in recent memory.  The sauce played a big role in that, being full of flavor and perfectly portioned onto the bread.  I got to try the pastrami one also, and that was was super good.  I think I'm going to get that next time I have a chance.

I got a taste of a bit of a rice krispie treat too, freshly made and just cut while we were eating!  It was probably the best rice krispie treat of my life, and cheap for the huge chunk you get.  All of their deserts looks amazing, so the menu category \"munchies\" fits perfectly.  

Anyway, Cheba Hut was delicious, the workers were awesome, the price was average, and I wish I lived closer so I could replace my daily Subway habit with it!"}
{"text":"Cheba Hut is a stoner-friendly sandwich shop from Arizona, now premiering their first Vegas valley location at Sahara and Rainbow. You don't have to get toasted to enjoy your meal, but there are multiple dispensaries in the same plaza. Staff are friendly and outgoing, making multiple recommendations and walking visitors through the menu (including sandwich sizes). Surprisingly, they also have an indoor/outdoor bar featuring unique and local brews. 

Aside from the cannabis-influenced decor and sandwich names, CH is known for their baked goods (get it?): their bread is \"legendary\" and they stock \"munchies\" at the register including rice crispies (in Captain Crunch and Fruity Pebble flavors) and various other sweet, snacky treats. Their garlic herb (heh) bread is pretty solid and pairs well with their Apollo 13 sando, with Greek flavors of grilled chicken, spring mix, salad dressing, cucumbers, tomato, red onion, and feta. I'd add some other melty cheese to this in the future. For bonus points, they have several vegetarian sandwiches!

I'm not the hugest fan of their open-face serving, the sandwiches seem to have less toppings than other places, but the prices are fair for the portion."}
{"text":"The prices are reasonable but probably because you are really just paying for bread. I ordered The Kind which is described as a turkey, bacon, Swiss and mushroom. The sandwich looks NOTHING like the pic. My sandwich had two slices of lunch meat grade turkey slices, one slice of bacon, about a slice of Swiss and about a 1/4 of a small button mushroom. Disappointing? Absolutely. My friend ordered the BLT. It was lame at best. But the bread is good, the staff is relaxed and the theme is fun."}
{"text":"First time eating here, and it was very good. My husband and I ordered the same thing. It had turkey, avocado, bacon and chipotle mayo to name a few of the ingredients. I thought mine was great. I also bought the brownie and cookie. The brownie was delish!!!!! The cookie was just okay. I won't order it again probably. The cashier was very nice to me and so was the person making our subs, but there wasn't a whole lot of what one might say \"professionalism\" going on. This doesn't bother me, but it might bother others. I heard a lot of cursing while waiting for my food and there was a lot of inappropriate talk of pot. Again, does not bother me, but could be offensive to some. The reason why I'm not giving a 5 star is because our order was wrong, which we realized when we got home. My husband said no sauce, pickles, tomato, mayo, or onion (basically he just wanted the cheese, meat, and avocado). His order had everything on it and since he can't tolerate spicy food at all, he didn't finish his sub. They weren't busy at all so I'm not sure why his order was wrong?..? We were coincidentally the only people there. I'd still return, but we'll just check out order before we leave next time."}
{"text":"This is a great stoner friendly sandwich shop, from the amazingly awesome decor with sublime , jay and silent bob photos, to the painted animations. The nachos were amazing! Made with Doritos was sooo tasty. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Used to be FIVE stars in my book, I have been coming here for the last 4 years....

Somehow $3 beer Friday turned to $5 beers when it came time to pay. What a fucking rip off. This was my first and probably last time getting beer here.

This place was so much cooler and comfortable before they bought the unit next door and expanded. Now it's bright, trendy, and has a \"corporate\" feeling to it. 

Food is still top notch but I wonder why the subs are coming out 2x faster than it used to when it's 5x busier. Less \"love\" put into it?

Staff was very nice as always but the \"experience\" sucked. I feel like I'm at an Olive Garden or Red Lobster. It feels like it's more of a restaurant that you feel obligated to tip your server than a place to just kick it and throw a tip in the tip jar for great service.

Five stars for the food.
Five stars for the staff.
1 star for what it has \"become.\""}
{"text":"For my 420th review, I would like to relive the old days when I would randomly go on a roadtrip to Arizona for really stupid things.

Going to Cheba Hut was NOT one of these stupid things.
A few of my high school friends always made the trip on 4/20 every year and I eventually thought it would be a good idea to visit.

They have veggie and meat options. I'm not too adventurous. When I have something delicious, I stick with it. Favorite veggie sandwich is the Train Wreck on herb bread. The more herb, the better?

My favorite meat sub is probably the Dank. You HAVE to get the blunt size. Nug is too small. Duh.

I just recently found out that they have locations in Corvallis and Eugene.
Day trip, anyone?"}
{"text":"First word that comes to mind when i walked into this joint (hehehe) was \"hippy.\" Its decor was exactly what you would expect seeing how it's name is Cheba Hut. They do make some awesome sandwiches and dessert/treats though. The ingredients taste fresh and i like that the sandwiches are made to order & are toasted too. 

Recommendations for sandwiches: (I usually get the \"pinner\" which is an 8\" sandwich.)
* White Widow - chicken, mushrooms, bacon and ranch. 
* Pac Blue - toasted tuna w/cheddar

Recommendations for treats: 
* Golden Grahams mallow treat was pretty freaking great!

If you go, you have to get the Kool-Aid to drink, something about an immediate sugar rush when it hits your lips is delightful. (Nostalgic i guess.)"}
{"text":"I love Cheba Hut (Tempe), but I don't find myself out there too often. Now that I am in Phoenix, and was over on this side for lunch, I was pretty excited to see there was a Cheba Hut nearby. I had a serious craving.

It was noon on a weekday and it was dead. Apparently this location gets super busy when school is in session, so being able to get right in and order was pure luck. My old stand-by is no longer on the menu (AZ Homegrown) so I went with my second favorite, Jamaican Red (add cream cheese). The guy who took my order was friendly and let me know there would be an additional charge for the cream cheese, which I was aware of but appreciate when you are given a heads up.

I got my drink (kool-aid....OH YEAH!), and waited for my sandwich....and waited...and waited....and waited...and waited some more....and, oh yay! Here is is! Finally!!!

First glance, pure disappointment. It was so bready. Toppings were scarce, even though I got everything on it. The chicken wasn't saucy like I'm accustomed to. In fact, it just seemed like plain chicken with some thin buffalo sauce squirted over the top. It wasn't very spicy but I was starving so I powered my way through it, even though the toasty bread tore up the roof of my mouth.

It sucks when you are looking forward to something that you know is so good but ends up being so bad. I'll give this location the benefit of the doubt and just hope I wandered in on an off day. Next time I'll just order something else."}
{"text":"Don't call in a order it won't arrive for about a hour with your lettuce soggy and bread as well.. must of made it then let it sit when they were able to have time to deliver. Usually they are fine but not tonight.."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches ever! Made to order and always delicious. Delivery is sometimes slow, but always worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Cheba Hut was one of those \"must go to\" places on my list for when I moved back to AZ. Unfortunately it took me over a year to get there. I had a hankerin' for a sandwich last week so I decided to venture to my least favorite part of Mesa to see if it was how I remembered.

I have to say that the whole ordering system is way more streamlined than it used to be. No more walking down the line while the person behind the counter asks if you want every condiment imaginable on your sandwich. You wait in a line to order while looking at the large menu posted on the wall, and when you get to the register the guy ringing you up asks what you want on it and rings you up accordingly. You pay and they bring it out to you. Instead of giving you a number, they give you a picture or character from a movie. Cute.

I ordered the Jamaican Red with hemp cream cheese. One of my favorites from the past. When I ordered, the guy ringing me up let me know it was an extra charge for the cream cheese. Thank you! It was just as I remembered. Buffalo chicken, olives, jalapenos, cream cheese....and toasted?!?! Yum!! I'm salivating just thinking of it now. They have an excellent selection of other sandwiches, salads, and treats. I didn't get one on this trip, but the rice krispee treats here are the best I've ever had (besides homemade). Back in the day I used to get the southwest chicken salad, also known as the AZ Homegrown. It was my #1 but it's not on the menu anymore. Curious if the White Widow replaced it? Maybe I'll give that a try next.

This location has some seating so even when crowded you can most likely get a table or pull up a stool along the window. My meal came to just under $12. Ouch! Although a little higher in price than what I like to spend on lunch, it won't deter me from going back."}
{"text":"Have been to the Uni location a bunch of times.  The sandwiches are great, and they make some awesome soups.  My first visit to the Tempe location two years ago was impressive for a bunch of reasons, first and foremost the food.  Second, the atmosphere . . . I don't mind waiting a few extra minutes with all kinds of wild and cool things to look at on the walls.  

Third . . . I sent an email to the company's website about my experience there, and the next day I received loose and friendly emails from TWO of their CEO's . . . one even asked for my mailing address so he could send me some freebies (Cheba Hut stickers and a card for a free sub).  I was blown away

The employees somehow pull off being very attentive yet chill at the same time.  Cheba has an atmosphere of \"We're great at what we do and we're having fun doing it\" . . . almost like having a backyard cookout.  Two guys were all into taking my order, the guy putting my toppings on was cool, and the girl getting the soup was all \"This is the best soup you're ever going to have, it'll blow your mind\"
 
And cool atmosphere aside, not once did I feel like my food was \"compromised\".  It was an awesome sub, and good luck ever getting good prosciutto at Subway.  Damn I love me some prosciutto

One love"}
{"text":"Friendliest service and best food ever!"}
{"text":"Used to live within walking distance and this by far my fav sub joynt in AZ...not only are the names of the grub cool, they serve beer and the staff is very chill...keep rockin Cheba hut"}
{"text":"Compared to other sub places in Phoenix, Ch?ba Hut has to be one of the best places. Second time here and both times they have been very friendly. They serve Kool aid ! Which is something you dont usually see at a restaurant. I'm not a smoker but, regardless if you are or not you'll enjoy this place with nice music playing."}
{"text":"I had the Five-O, aka the Vegetarian's Nightmare. It was a good sandwich!

What I didn't like was that I felt all confused about ordering and picking the food up. I also couldn't hear what they were asking me over the music (which, BTW, I liked the Drum & Bass).

Will I be back? Sure!"}
{"text":"Tasty toasted sandwiches with a little side of weird and a whole lot of pot references. But, back to the sandwiches...The signature garlic herb bread is fantastic and they have a ton of options. Plus, the staff is super nice/laid back (I'm sure everyone is shocked by this) and will make some pretty great suggestions. My last sandwich here was the pinner KGB, a roast beef sandwich with mushrooms, bell peppers, and Swiss with extra horseradish sauce plus the works (lettuce, tomato, onions, oil, vinegar, Parmesan cheese and oregano). Added some Pineapple Yerba Matte iced tea and I was super happy. I wouldn't bring your conservative mother-in-law to this place due the the giant blunt sculpture hovering in the back, but anyone else who loves a good sandwich will adore this place."}
{"text":"I've only ever been to this place at night, like much later than you should be getting a loaded up sandwich. One look around the restaurant, you know the theme here. It's different and it's fun. The weed themed everything is great, and they really hook up with a great sammy. 

I got their 'blunt' size Panama Red (Chicken Parm) and it was amazing. The guy behind the counter was playing his role perfectly. Made hints at smoking and how good the sandwiches taste after a few puffs. I thoroughly enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"Over the last year, I have ordered many times from Cheba Hut and always had an amazing experience.  Today though, for whatever reason, they are refusing to deliver to me.  This blows me away, especially when the reason they give is that I (after many previous deliveries) am too far out of their delivery range.  
Today's excuse was they had too much \"stuff to do, man\".  I was hung up on twice, when I finally spoke to someone who wasn't a complete asshole on the phone, there was no good reason given for their sudden inability to deliver after months of providing great service.  The staff treated me like I was an inconvenience not a paying customer. 
 I'm almost positive that I will still be charged for this meal after the complete incompetence I was exposed to.  A shame that this location has decided to abandon loyal customers.  
Good luck if the team is being asked to do things that serve their customers, if it is out of their comfort zone or they are too high they won't help you."}
{"text":"Oh man... I swear they sprinkle magic on their sandwiches. That's the only explanation I have for for craving Cheba Hut at least once a day. I've tried a handful of items and they're all delicious and unique. My favorite is the Griefo with bacon- yes a veggie sandwich WITH bacon. The hemp cream cheese is super duper! 

The staff is friendly and they don't speed through the orders even when there is a line and I mean that as a compliment. There's nothing worse than getting food home to find that it was thrown together in a hurry. I want to taste that love! Cheba Hut puts it in there. 

The decor is a bit over-the-top hippie tacky but it's a small price to pay for kool-aid and tang on tap. YUM."}
{"text":"If you want your typical fast, mediocre sub sandwich then this is not the place.

If you want the toasted sub of a life time, come here.
Every sub is unique (not something you can get just anywhere). Oh and the sandwiches come out perfect EVERYTIME because the staff doesn't rush through putting them together. Great atmosphere, great food. Hands down awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent! Definitely the best nachos I've ever had. And the subs? Fantastic. I was even sober when I went and I still loved it. Everything is fresh and delicious, and can you beat refillable koolaid? I think not!"}
{"text":"Awesome unique sandwiches that are 2 full meals if you get the blunt. Lots of great combinations, love the atmosphere and energy of the people here, it's where I go to blow the diet a little and make it fully worth it!"}
{"text":"Great bread, unique subs, good tunes... A winning combo.  Decor and vibe of this place is great, and the food above average as far as subs go!  Worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Creative menu ideas. Good tasting all around. Great break from the 'normal' sandwich stops."}
{"text":"Looking for a tasty late night snack while cruising in Tempe? This is definitely the place to go especially if you're seeking a casual, laidback atmosphere. As the name suggests (Cheba Hut), everything is Mary Jane themed ;). The sizes of the subs include the nug (4\"), the pinner (8\"), and the blunt (12\").

Additionally! All the sandwiches are named after some all time favorite strains of ganga, my favorite being the white widow (ranch, bacon, and chicken featured in the pick below). 

Simply step up to the counter, place your order, pay with cash or card, and voilá! You're sandwich is ready faster than you can light one up. They're totally customizable so no need to fret about and ingredient you might not want in your sub. 

Whether weed is your thing or not, these sandwiches are addicting ;). Don't forget to check out there cereal treats, cookies, brownies, and drinks on tap! And drink the koolaid"}
{"text":"It was either the WonderBrett weed I smoked or it was the Power Plant with a little Blunt style added to it. This place is defiantely BLAZZZING!  five drools for sure. Yummy!"}
{"text":"CHEEEEBAAAA HUTTTTT!!  This is fun, relaxing place to have a toasted sub.

I recommend having the Acapulco Gold.  It's a BBQ chicken sandwich.  They have GIANT rice krispie treats for dessert.  They also have treats made with other stuff like fruity pebbles, golden grahams, cocoa pebbles, etc.

They also offer fountain drinks that include, but are not limited to:  grape kool-aid aka purple drink, and TANG.

I've been here a dozen times, the service and the food are consistently goood."}
{"text":"Love this place......great subs, AND they're open later which is a HUGE plus....I get caught up w/work and realize I'm STARVING, and no place is open....then I remember....CHEBA HUT!!! Delish!!


Just went and ate again.....Stoners make a damn fine sammy....will they print that?!?!"}
{"text":"Food = pretty darn good! Delivery.... Not so much. Forgot half our order and had to go back. Order was also wrong. They also do not call to inform you they are out of something you ordered and will sub it for something they deem similar."}
{"text":"One of the best toasted subs I have ever had! Literally picked the house I live in because it in delivery area of Cheba Hut! I do prefer to eat in as the environment is perfect for a hippie at heart! The music, what they play on tv, the excitement of the staff, the colorfulness of the walls.... i prefer to eat in."}
{"text":"Love this spot for good grub. My food and snacks and drinks are always on point. Super down to earth place,workers and customers. Go Green ( rough around the edges look,could be a little cleaner looking, but hey YoLo:) the taste makes you not care"}
{"text":"Umm yumm. The toasted subs here are uh mazing! I stopped by around 10pm on a Thursday night and people were still coming in. 

The cashier was very friendly and we had more then enough time to look over the pretty big menu. We ended up going for the white widow with all the toppings and we definitely had to make it a blunt size. (12in) We had already set our minds on sharing this gigantic sub so we opted for the 12inch. I also got a bag of chips and a small drink and my total was close to $14.

We sat down and waited a little more then 5 minutes. The same guy who rang us up brought over our sub to where we were seated. They were kind enough to cut our sub in two and put it in two different trays. 

The white widow sub is so GOOD!! It had warm chicken, mushrooms, bacon, and it was covered in their ranch sauce. The bread was toasted and warm so it made it that much better! 

There is plenty of seating and they also have an outside area. They have a bar area, and they also have different flavored look aids! 

Give this place a try! The food is great and the employees are very friendly!"}
{"text":"What a terrible experience - order online with an estimate of 12 min.  Arrive 23 min later, not ready.  Wait another 7 minutes.  Referred to as the chic that ordered online.  Both salads missing the chicken that comes with them.  Phone number goes to a general cox voicemail account.  Disaster of service"}
{"text":"Tasty sandwiches... funny stoner theme... not-so-funny stoner order accuracy. It's a fun fix, but check your sandwich before you leave."}
{"text":"Between services and nearby. La Cana loaded up has never done me wrong. Still didn't disappoint even 10 years later. Thank you again! Friendly staff and now has a bar inside"}
{"text":"If you've got the munchies and are in the mood for a toasted sub, do yourself a favor and stop by Cheba Hut. They have a hilarious menu and their food is really good. The staff are always in a good mood and are very friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sub shops around. Truly they perfected the toasted sub. Forget Quiznos and subway you need to come here. 

My favorite Is the Kind. Don't ask what it is just order it and get extra pickles, oh yes they are real pickles! They are crisp spear cuts not like those old sliced ones from a jar like everywhere else. 

Oh and the cookies are awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best places in town for  toasted sub sandwiches! Consistently great quality, great taste and great service! Not much more you can ask for in a sub shop! I have been coming to Cheba Hut for 15 years or so and have never had a bad or even poor experience. Highly reccomended!"}
{"text":"Come on, anyone who isn't amused by stoned dudes making your lunch is just a fuddy duddy with a stick up their rear. 

The fact that these guys are gainfully employed is point one in their favor. The fact that the food doesn't just taste good if you've smoked your breakfast is star number two. Goofy weed paraphernalia entertains you as the most laid back staff on the planet puts your sandwich together. Granted, it takes a few more minutes than fast food, but most lunches that contain actual food will.

I get the \"Kind\". Turkey bacon mushroom on jalepeno bread. Throw some sprouts on it with mustard. I feel so self righteous and \"damn the man\" walking out of this place I sometimes double check to make sure I still have on deodorant. 

Yep, I'm still a yuppie cheeseball everytime I leave, but for an instant I contemplate dreads and the chill life everytime I grab lunch here.

Or at least the good old bong hit Saturdays of college life....tough call."}
{"text":"HUGE fan of this place. Soup in the bread bowl was amazeballs. If you need a lunch spot after a long work morning, stop here!!! It's got a nice vibe, too!"}
{"text":"I love Cheba Hut's toasted subs. I've been to the Tempe and Mesa locations multiple times and this Glendale location proves to be just as good. My favorite is the White Widow on white bread.  It's a chicken bacon ranch sub with mushrooms.  I pass on the mushrooms but add their chipotle ranch. They have multiple dressings that are made fresh everyday that I'm sure will enjoy.  If you are currently a student at GCC I recommend Cheba Hut over any place you might think about going on campus."}
{"text":"I love Cheba hut. My personal favorite is the White Widow. Its the best chicken bacon ranch sandwich out there. Their meat and dressings are prepared fresh daily.  Great spot for lunch breaks but be prepared to wait, the line will be long."}
{"text":"Wow!!!

I am so glad I stopped in here. The sandwich was Fantastic. I got 'The Kind' on wheat and it was so satisfying. Discovering the cozy bar down on the patio side and acquiring a pint of Lagunitas made it joyous. What a wonderful world in here.

Try Cheba Hut!"}
{"text":"Great location friendly staff. If you have dairy allergies, I just found out all the bread has dairy in it."}
{"text":"The Midwest Best does it for me hands down. This place is always good to come to if you have some killer munchies. Chronic is also one of my favorites. Can't go wrong with what you get! The kool aid they offer also makes me giddy.  :)"}
{"text":"AK47 is my all time favorite but  ZOMFG if you have not tried the white widow on garlic with shrooms you are missing out to make it even taste better add some @fuegomaya to it it will be your best bud"}
{"text":"Everytime I'm in the Phoenix area I make a stop at Cheba Hut. The place is completely marijuana themed and their sandwiches are absolutely delicious. Can't say enough good things about this place. Love it!"}
{"text":"I love the food at Cheba Hut - I would recommend it to anyone. The problem is the rudeness of the staff there. They act like they are too busy or have better things to do than take your order. Expect to wait a long time for your food. Don't go there if you are on your lunch break or in a hurry, because you are gonna have to wait. Music is extremely loud. Not a place you can go to have a business meeting to discuss business - not a good place for a date cause you can't talk to your date due to the loud music."}
{"text":"This place is funny. Just go the restaurant and look at the decorations. Read the menu items and they'll make you laugh. Also, the sandwiches have many different and unique options. It's cool! Staff is friendly. Freshness and quality of food is a 6 out of a 10."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and eat here for every meal for the rest of your life. Seriously. Weed theme, employees are the chillest to ever live (I wonder why), Kool-Aid on tap and sandwiches that will make you wonder what universe you are in. When I become a billionaire, I am going to open one of these in my bedroom so I can watch Terminator 1 and pig out all day every day on the top bunk of my pure gold plated bunk bed. To be totally honest, I'm kinda pissed I'm not eating there right now...."}
{"text":"OK, I usually see the glass as half full, but I've gone back to Cheeba Hut to give it another try and I just hafta say I think I'm not the target audience for this place.

Positives:  The staff was nice.  The guy who made my sandwich was super awesome.   

Most of the other guys I felt like they were sneering at me (maybe I was paranoid, man).  Maybe it was business attire and I represented \"the man\", man.

It always seems dirty inside.  

The food, frankly sucks.  For $10 I could get a HUGE kick-ass hoagie at Jimmy John's or Silver Mine subs. Cheeba's always seem to be lacking in meat & cheese. The roll, which was admittedly toasted, was so stale to begin with it basically crumbled into chunks when I tried to eat it.  The tomatoes were still green (and no, they were not high-end schmancy heirloom tomatoes...they were unripe).  The meats were skimpy, salty and flavorless.

All in all, I think this is more about the schtick and stoned college kids, than actually serving up a quality sammie.  Maybe you need to be slit-eyed stoned and have the munchies to really get this place."}
{"text":"Bro. This place is DANK. Food is pretty damn delicious. Oh yeah they have kool-aid. I've gone twice and will definitely hit this spot up again. I had the Dank Sinatra the first visit and second I had the Cali Mist (not toasted upon request.) I  recommend this place whether you high or not. It's next to a dispensary. By the way did I mention they have  Kool-Aid!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few time and always friendly and more importantly good food. If the make you wait to long or mess something up, chances are you get a free cookie or another treat."}
{"text":"Toasted is what we have in this place and it is pretty tasty. Hippie kind of vibe going on here. Bob Marley, Jimi Hendrix, psychedelic wall art, Kool aid and lots of other references to being high ... on life of course.

Cool music playing outside as you walk up to the door. Inside gets even cooler (109 degrees today outside). Nice!

I was welcomed immediately and told about the menu and what was good or popular. Some of the items on the menu are called by names you may have seen in a medical mary jane dispensary or on one of your favorite TV shows.

HUMBOLT, KUSH, TRAIN WRECK, ACAPULCO GOLD, JAMAICAN RED, THAI STICK, MAJIC MUSHROOM ... Too many to list them all.

Had to get Toasted with a Toasted Sub and went with the 12\" Blunt size Widow Maker. Did not think the Pinner size would be enough. Comes with Chicken breast smothered in their signature, home-grown ranch dressing, then topped with mushrooms, bacon & provolone cheese. You can mix or match toppings if you wish.

Service is super friendly and most accommodating. Menu also has other items like Salads, Soups, or something Sweet to finish things off. Just tell them what you want. Jah Man!"}
{"text":"Love , love , LOVE THIS PLACE !!! I have gone twice already and both times the food was amazing ! The staff is so friendly and there are so many options for so many people ! There's a full bar , but it's still a nice , casual environment good for all ages !
Would definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best subs I've had in years. I had the kgb, which is roast beef, Swiss, mushrooms, etc. I had it with mustard and horseradish sauce on the garlic and herb bun. It was pretty awesome. 

The people working there were super friendly. 

The also her is a little bit rock n roll/ reggae, which you would expect if you know anything about his place. The vibe is pretty cool. 

I'll be back for sure. They have too many sandwich choices not to go again..."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are pretty average here, but love the munchies section of the store. Anything they make that involves rice krispies would be a great choice. The goo balls, especially the one with Captain Krunch, was excellent under the right conditions. The rest of the menu plays out a bit different, but the use of spring mix in all the sandwiches really sucks. That kind of lettuce belongs in a salad, not a sandwich. My order was a pretty simple humboldt, but you need to remove that lettuce to enjoy the sandwich better. This chain used to let you add ingredients as you go down the line (after toasting), but now it;s whatever is on the menu you get. Obviously, most customers might be in another mindset in which anything tastes good, but the experienced gourmet 420 people should be thrown a bone as well."}
{"text":"Knew I had to go here after seeing the theme and giant blunt hanging from the wall. Next time I will get a blount size sandwich, but today just tried the 8 inch pinner. My order was for \"the Kind\", turkey/bacon/mushrooms and swiss. This was a great toasty sandwiich, best one I have in the toasted category. Lots of fresh toppings added as you yell out what you would like in the sandwich. Garlic herb Bread is clearly the way to go here. Of course of my first visit I had to try the snacks and ended up with a chocolate and vanilla rice krispy treat, which was unusual, sorta healthy and good for post session desert. This is my kind of place, it would have been back in college too. Some things never change. Alsom oipen til midnight."}
{"text":"This place didn't disappoint.  Located beside marijuana dispensary- don't get swayed away cause the sandwiches are awesome. Toasted, fresh, crunchy bread.  I choose the garlic bread with my Dank Sinatra-  really good.  The white widow didn't disappoint as well. My son had the meatball sandwich which he demolished.  Make room for dessert- the treats are the bomb- smores and the ball- aww so good.  Definitely will come back and recommend this joint."}
{"text":"Ohhhh Cheba Hut, \"WHERE THE ONLY THING FRIED IS THE OCCASIONAL CUSTOMER!\" - exactly as I remember.

I stopped in here for a quick bite and to rekindle old memories of high school.. as usual, the line is longer than it should be, because it takes forever to place and receive your order, possibly because everyone who works here IS ACTUALLY STONED. I don't mind though. A sub shop with sandwiches with names like \"The Kind\", \"Kush\" & \"AZ Homegrown\", and sandwich sizes labeled as Nug (4\") Pinner (8\") &  Blunt (12\"), this has got to be expected. And I do believe that there is an Oz. of love in each sammich they make as well. Lately I've been on this mushroom kick so I decided on the Majic Mushroom Portabella.. consisting of Portabella mushrooms with their home-grown teriyaki glaze, then topped with green bell peppers, pineapple & pepper jack cheese. Fn' F'yeah is all I have to say about this magnificent piece of lunch. I used to order the AK-47 or the Pakalolo, which are both awesome as well, but my shroom sandwich was spot on. I loved it.

This place is definitely worth the wait.. the only reason they lost a star is because they're slow, and I was in a bit of a hurry.. still, i'm totally going back, dude."}
{"text":"Go to the one in Mesa. This location is disgusting. Need to clean the place up. Look at the fire sprinklers and the joint hanging above the cashier, they are COATED with dust and grime, makes me wonder how the kitchen is treated."}
{"text":"I've been criticized for rating too many places 5 stars, and I rebut: that's because I don't eat at crappy places.  You think you are a food snob?  Pah.  You are nothing in your snobbery.  I am an everything snob, so when it comes to food, which is what I do best, all of my other practiced, routine snobbiness comes flooding to the fore.  This makes me the best ever decider of whether or not something is tasty.  You, whoever you may be, are not.  I'm sorry, but there has to be a best of everything, and I am best at this.

So to those of you who have not given cheba hut five stars, there are only three possibilities: either you visited them on an off day, you didn't try the east coastern (pastrami with mozzarella, mustard, pepperoncinis, toasted on garlic sub roll with everything--mayo, vinegar and oil, black olives, pickle, parmesan cheese, oregano, and probably a little love), or you know nothing at all about food.

The place needs cleaning, I admit.  But that is the theme.  And while I find it funny that an entire restaurant can be themed after all things stoner, replete with more euphemisms than you could ever dream of for weed, it neither adds to nor detracts from my rating or overall opinion of the place.  No, the subs here are sensational, made with just the right amount of everything all heaped on to whichever bread you choose.

Maybe you aren't creative enough for cheba hut.  Maybe you just don't really see what it's all about.  I can't tell you if that is or isn't true.  But what I can say is that if you don't think the food here is great, you're wrong.

I'm sorry."}
{"text":"Amazing Spot great service. Lol a little funny on the ordering but still family friendly. In the area i recommend stopping by. madeline made my experience over the top."}
{"text":"I ordered two sandwiches, but only received one.  The restaurant said they made it; the delivery girl denied having it.  Grubhub. Lame experience."}
{"text":"This place is LEGIT.  Seriously.

Sorry if word abbreviations bother you (my grandmother was a high school English teacher and just hates the popular use of 'legit' more than just about anything else- sorry, Grandma!), but I could not think of a better word for Cheba Hut.

The space is a vast improvement from the several previous restaurants that I have seen at the location - the interior is spacious, clean, and filled with cool art and posters.

The staff was awesome - very friendly and helpful.  I was greeted warmly and given very tasty recommendations as to how I should dress up my sub.

Speaking of which, the sub was delicious!!  I went with the Majic Mushroom sans-cheese, which was teriyaki portabella mushrooms, pineapple, and peppers.  I added a bit of mustard, some lettuce, onion, tomato, pickle, and cucumbers.  It was stuffed to the brim.   The flavors were great and everything tasted amazingly fresh - because it was!  Before I ordered, the cashier explained how in-house their shop was - they make their own dressings, cream cheeses and guacamole, slice their own veggies, and bake from scratch their own \"munchies\" like hemp brownies, cereal treats, and more.

They also offer a few selections of local brews.

The only way I could see improvement is perhaps by offering gluten-free bread? Just because my roommate, who recently found out she's gluten-intolerant was bummed she couldn't join me.  Otherwise, I can't think of anything - Cheba Hut rocks.

I highly recommend you guys check this place out."}
{"text":"Best sandwich place ever! I was hungry late last night at 11:30pm I stopped in. They have great late night hours. I got the Magic Mushroom Portabella sandwich 12\" (blunt) This is the biggest fattest best sandwich ever!!! They have great customer service and are very knowledgeable. This isn't your typical sub! Highly recommended! No pun intended! :p Thanks for the great experience Cheba Hut! :)"}
{"text":"this place is more of a marketing ploy than a sandwich shop. i know, i know, i must work for the man or be a hater, but that's not it. even back when i did fully and actively support their mantra, i thought the food was way too expensive for what it is and none too great.

yay! local independent eateries, boo going there just becuase, \"dude, the sandwiches are like, totally, named after my favorite strain, man.\""}
{"text":"By far, this is the best sandwich place in town.  It's really all about food quality here believe it or not.  It starts with the bread, and here it is perfect.  The meats are all excellent quality.  Top notch AK-47 (French Dip)  and the 5-0 (Italian)  Cheba Hut also has the best pickles which is huge.  Must order the hot pepper salad or whatever it's called the geanara or something.   It is a must have on the 5-0.  The staff is way great as well.  With the loud music and artwork, it feels like a ganja bar, a total escape.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I now get the 5-0 easy chedder.  The pickles rule, and the chili salad, I forget the name cause it's a weird name of course, is awesome on every sandwich."}
{"text":"The Sandwiches were tasty and tasted like Diego sandwich shop. The Garlic Bread is different making the sandwich it more flavorful . I like that it gives you 3 size sandwiches to choose from cause everyone is not a big eater. I luv the decor and sandwich names."}
{"text":"I love cheba hut! The food is amazing and everyone is always so friendly! Everything I have tried is delicious!  Best sandwiches in town!!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first time here and all I can say is WOW. Cheba Hut does everything right in terms of quality in food, ambiance, and customer service that was friendly and quick. I ordered the KGB in the pinner size with light horseradish and it did not dissapoint! Although I plan on trying the whole menu to eat every sandwich I would definitely re-order that sandwich again. My girlfriend ordered the Midwest Best in the nug size and of course I had to try it lol it was delicious, especially and there was no shortage of meat in it! We also shared the pretzel nuggets which were amazing along with the mustard it comes with. Aside from the food I really enjoyed the decorations and artwork scattered around the lobby, they did a great job in making it clear how stoner friendly they are lol. In conclusion I really recommend Cheba Hut to anyone looking for an amazing sandwich place or just a foodie in general!"}
{"text":"How the hell have I survived this long without knowing the god-like sandwiches that are made here?

I don't like \"sub sandwiches\". I hardly like regular sandwiches. When my boyfriend says \"Hey, you want to get a sub?\", I'm like \"FUCK NO, don't you know that I hate them?!\" But then one day he took me here and OMG.. my life has been forever changed.

I ordered the \"white widow\" which was a delicious combination of chicken, cheese and I think ranch dressing. OMG. It was like an orgasm in my mouth.  I happily ate my awesome sandwich and giggled when I looked over on the wall painting and there was a little stoned crab smiling up at me. He totally knew how GLORIOUS this sandwich was. 

The staff is very nice, the food was delicious, and it was quite possible that at least half of the customers were stoned. But that's ok. Stoner food is mouth watering. I'm longing for my next toasted sub adventure. Mmmmm."}
{"text":"Pretty \"meh\" sandwich. No chips or drink included, and even though I asked for it hot it was just a tad above room temp. Taste wise it was a 6 out of 10. The names are way better than the food."}
{"text":"Your local stoner friendly sandwich shop. Conveniently located next to a recreational dispensary and medical marijuana licensing facility, Cheba Hut is the best place in Las Vegas to \"get toasted\" (off their famous toasted subs). I'm from San Diego and although the original location is in Tempe, AZ, I've been hooked ever since I've had their delicious sandwiches on their fresh baked bread in Mission Beach (go for the garlic). The strain friendly sandwich names such as AK-47 (French Dip) and White Widow (Chicken Ranch) in combination with the cannabis related decor make ordering a unique and fun experience for all who enter into this welcoming atmosphere. 

I was pleased to see this location features an indoor/outdoor bar with plenty of seating serving a variety of craft beers and specialty drinks. They offer a variety of \"munchies\" to cure any appetite whether it be sweet or savory. One of my favorite aspects that is unique to Cheba Hut is the variety of flavors of Kool-Aid they offer along with their fountain drinks and iced tea. From the fresh sandwiches and salads, to the delicious sweets made in house such as rice krispie bars, brownies, and goo balls nothing disappoints. For those looking for delicious sandwiches, a welcoming staff, great drinks, and the best vibes in the valley then look no further, you've found your place."}
{"text":"When here with a few co workers for lunch. I'd never been here before but heard the food was good. I ordered and waited about a half hour for my food. The people that ordered in front of me got their order so I waited a few more minuets before asking for my order. When I asked I was told there was a mistake.  They asked what I ordered on it. So I waited a few more minuets still no sandwich. So I asked again and was told it wasn't ready. I didn't want my co workers to be late with me so we left in order to be on time for work.

Update.6/12/18
Ended up giving it second chance just a different location.
Went to Mesa was served immediately the White Widow the foods great! Buy the munchie for later.
My original experience was shaky at best but Mesa made me change my mind.
Changing to 4 stars"}
{"text":"Affordable, cute theme, and plenty of non-meat sandwich options for my vegetarian husband. We've come here once and are now going back for seconds! Great job cheba hut. Also perfect place for stoners."}
{"text":"Delicious as always, can never complain, other than I was under the impression cheba hut glasses counted as VIP glasses, not just shirts"}
{"text":"Honestly. I mean, just wow. This sandwich/sub spot is where it's at.

The staff are friendly and service is prompt, no ridiculous wait times. The atmosphere here is what really makes the dining experience unique. Who doesn't love a 4/20 friendly joint? (All pun intended.) I had the AK-47 and my boo ordered the red widow. Both subs were beyond amazing. And the desserts... my diabetic heart can't take it. Must try the goo ball! So good. I want to come back and try the other sweets and rest of the menu items.

Thanks to my boyfriend for putting me on to this place! Am definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sub shop. I've been going here since the late 90s and have passed the love of Cheba Hut onto my kids! I highly recommend the white widow Pinner on wheat... And get it loaded."}
{"text":"We come here for the Orange Widow & stay for the laid back hospitality.  I'm not sure they have a bad sandwich & love that the secret stash is different at each location.

The older Cheba Huts are a fave as the newer ones remind me of a Hipster Jimmy Johns. 

Back to the Orange Widow... for a mind blowing experience, add the house humus. You'll be changed forever."}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars because of the food, but the service is terrible ! I always get witty jokes from the cashier guys that are slightly offensive. I know their joking half the time but it's just not funny when its every time I come in. Sometimes I just want to get a sandwich and go !"}
{"text":"They have fountain cool-aid and funky names for the sandwiches! I went out of my why to try this joint out. it's good and I was cracking up at the cashier and her blood shot eyes! lol"}
{"text":"Ugh. The worst thing about marijuana is the culture. Anyway, some credit is due to the owners of this place, they have found a successful niche.  This place is always busy.

I get the whole \"toasted\" subs thing. Ha ha. However, having every sub toasted + having one slow toaster = a recipe for waiting forever.  It can take up to 20-30 minutes to get your sandwich during the lunch rush, and they really aren't that great.

I recommend finding the nearest Port Of Subs.  Sure, your sandwich won't be made amongst wacky stoners, but it will taste better and be ready much, much faster."}
{"text":"So...dang...good. The Humbolt on garlic herb is ahhhhhmazing (make sure you get a side of ranch) and it goes down well with a tall cup of Kool-Aid. Lunch time can be crazy and if you go in the afternoon, prepare for a lengthy wait. Not cheap but not expensive and definitely the quintessential 'munchies' food."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! There is a nation chain sub shop about 40 yards away that sells generic subs for around the same price..... My advice is to make the 40 yard dash to ch?ba hut and get yourself lifted off a Castro blunt!! ( large size sub) the Castro is a freaking phenomenal tasting sub!!! Lots of great local beers to quench your thirst and COOL-AID ON TAP!! You can't miss when you take a big pull off of one of these unique and delicious TOASTED subs!! Cough, cough."}
{"text":"Absolutely love coming to this place. The food is amazing, the atmosphere is so chill and the staff are always friendly with smile on. If you're ever in town or the area, definetly check out this place, its a one of a kind hole in the wall and you'll love the snacks they got."}
{"text":"Vegans be aware...

After going to Cheba hut over the past couple years while being a vegan today was the first day I've been told that the bread is not vegan. So I ordered a salad and left a nice tip in the tip jar for them finally telling me that the bread is not vegan. This came as such a surprise because I've been asked before if I was vegan and have told them I'm vegan. 

The salad that I received had VERY little toppings and was missing some that I ordered, also it came with croutons made with the non-vegan bread. The dressing that came with the salad was basically flavorless oil which completely covered any of the flavor of the salad. 

The shift lead, who was understanding and apologetic, asked if I'd like the salad remade and I declined. And I'm glad I did. 

As my party and I were leaving the entire kitchen staff was having a seemingly good time at the expense of my poor experience. One of the missing toppings for my salad was hummus which one employee had said \"he should be happy we forgot the hummus, it's not vegan either\" 

Pretty disheartening coming from the Cheba Hut crew. 

I did not want anything in return for my poor experience I simply wanted to inform the staff of the mistake. Now you can hear of their mistake."}
{"text":"This location is really awesome some times and other times it's pretty lousy. The last time I visited, they made my sandwhich wrong even though I had specifically explained to the guy how I wanted it. When I told him it wasn't correct another employee proceeded to tell me they couldn't take the sandwich back. Luckily a third employee took my sandwhich and remade it for me. I thought all was great until my sandwhich came back with no dressing and with tomatoes and onions when I had specifically asked for NO ONIONS or TOMATOES. I was very disappointed after that."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Cheba Hut. The food is awesome, the location is perfect(it's close to were I live).The staff is super 'chill'. I always find myself coming here for lunch. I would highly recommend Cheba Hut to anyone."}
{"text":"I always get the Cali Mist. It has the tastiest chipotle mayo I have ever had, ever, and being a chipotle mayo connoisseur that says a lot.

The subs are all so full of flavor, my mouth is watering just writing this. Orders do take a little bit of time to make since the store is always so busy so I typically call in for pick up so that it's ready when I get there."}
{"text":"Great subs and snacks for anyone with the munchies. The decor and music were definitely on par with the theme. Loved the blunt of kind while listening to some Rebelution and Sublime. The grape Kool-aide was fantastic, not too sweet. Will be back for the AK-47."}
{"text":"Great place !  Call ahead to save time for pick up .. very busy on saturday.  Da Bomb and Panama Red are awesome."}
{"text":"Cheba Hut is the type of place that once you get a craving for it, you just can't stop craving it until you have it in your belly. Which is why I only let the craving go for about an hour. I have to indulge.

It is in somewhat of an awkward strip mall, but it's old Tempe. My favorite? The Afghani with extra jalapenos and of course a cup of Purple Kool-aid. :D"}
{"text":"Checked this place out with my husband and two young daughters. I hadn't been here since I was young enough for the Mill scene. The sandwiches were great. My daughter LOVED the pb&j option. It was a really fun choice along with all of the other great vegetarian options. Even ordering the smallest sandwich, I was stuffed with veggie and hummus goodness. Other than having to explain why a whole restaurant was based on that funny leaf, the whole family had a great experience. My husband was especially impressed by the number of good beers available on tap."}
{"text":"Dude, this place is seriously good. I had the Chronic on garlic bread; which is roast beef with cheese, green peppers and some other stuff. I'll be going back for 420 day and getting the $4.20 meal served on a frisbee.

AND... any place that serves Tang and Koolaid is getting 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I don't smoke the cheba, or herb. But who cares when this place has amazing sammiches. I've ate here about 5x time and I LOVE IT! They even have two teas that are fresh and KOOL AID!!!! I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Very nice location, cool staff very friendly, clean inside and ppl. It was my first time in Arizona, I'll definitely be back forever lol"}
{"text":"I do appreciate that Cheba Hut is open fairly late every day and the atmosphere inside is super cool. However, the sandwiches here were just okay to me. Granted I only tried the Panama Red sandwich which is similar to a chicken parm sandwich but I've had much better elsewhere. I suppose I could come back here for some late night food again but next time I would rather seek out other options than come back here.

Great atmosphere especially for a first-timer however the food did leave a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"One of AZ's best!!! Bomb food, the best koolaid, and fun atmosphere. Night crew is where it's at!!!! Thanks for the heavy metal!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Delivery charge is fair. Food is great. Their house dressing is not vegan because it contains cheese. You can order oil, vinegar, and seasoning with no parm for a vegan or dairy free option. They have many different choices for all preferences. Cereal bars and brownies are over-sized."}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best sandwich shops in Arizona. I usually get the white widow, but I've never had a bad sandwich. Everyone here is great, as is the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The garlic bread is a game changer. 

With a chill atmosphere and funny sandwich names I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We used to order regularly from Cheba but. Now we will never order again. First I called and they put me on hold for 5 minutes, after listening to the recording 3 times I hung up and called back. The girl who answered the phone was so kind and told me they got a new computer system that they were learning. I COMPLETELY understand how frustrating that can be. I patiently waited for about 15 minutes while I put in my order. She let me know that it would be about 45 minutes to an hour. After waiting an hour and 30 minutes we called to check on the status, they told us the driver was walking out and they should be there within 15 minutes. After 2 hours and 15 minutes our food showed up not only freezing cold, but disgustingly soggy. I couldn't even finish the sandwich because it was so wet and falling apart. I'm SO disappointed because we love the food and the people have been great. However, after no phone calls from them, disgusting food, we won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"Not very happy with the level of service I received tonight. Order online, went to pick it up and was told that no order was received whatsoever. I received an email confirmation so it's a little confusing how my order was not found. It took forever to receive what we wanted. Finally when we got the sandwiches to go, of course what I didn't want was on the sandwich. It very upsetting that this is what I experienced with Cheba Hut. I love their sandwiches but I do not like the service they offer. Something needs to happen within the staff and management."}
{"text":"The 5-0 is a 5.0 in my book. Love this place always enjoy ordering new items or the same item either way you won't go wrong. Fun environment, cool vibes, great play on words, and of course great food to top it off!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness..where have you been all my life. This place is legit. The bread, meat and toppings are on point. Not to mention you don't have to pay an arm and a leg for a damn good sandwich. I just wish it was closer to home. The vibe of this place is very laid back, plus a bar you can sit at and relax with lots of different beers. If you Go, say hi to Mondo at the bar.. really cool dude. I had the 5-0 (all the pig) on garlic bread, Oh my goodness I almost died with the fresh toppings and like 6 different types of pork. My boyfriend has the G-13 (roast beef and turkey).. he barely wanted to hand it over to let me try a bit. We also tried some of the french onion soup, which was really good brpth freshly made with red onions. I will definitely be back sooner then later. Thanks for ruining every other sandwich place in town."}
{"text":"Passing thru Arizona on another one of our road trips. We had originally heard about this place from some friends, so we decided to give it a chance. Very friendly atmosphere and very fresh tasting food. I was honestly surprised at how good my Apollo 13 was !!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. I can't believe I hadn't checked it out sooner. The concept is hilarious and the food is really good. I got The Kind (bacon, turkey, swiss, and mushrooms) and it was delicious. The guys that worked there were really warm and friendly and joked with me. They even have Kool-Aid which I think is awesome. The sandwiches don't need mustard or mayo; the oregano and oil and vinegar give it enough flavor. This has easily become my favorite sandwich shop in the Tempe area and I look forward to eating here again as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Came here late one night because not many other places were open. The hummus plate was good, especially the spicy one (its super hot though and I like spicy food). The pretzel balls were nice, and the tuna sandwich was pretty good...my only issue was that the bread was too crunchy and a little difficult to eat. Overall though nice flavors."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place today while visiting The Source next door. This place is amazing!! Great great atmosphere and the food is top notch! I got my sub to go. I got \"The Cronic\" in \"Blunt\" size 12\" with garlic herb bread! I will be coming back! This place is just awesome and with food as good and prices are excellent. No matter where I live in Vegas I will make it a point to come here."}
{"text":"OVERALL: I would eat Cheba Hut every day if I could afford it.

THE GOOD
- The subs are consistently delicious. It doesn't matter who's behind the counter, they will taste the same - EPIC.

- The service is rarely slow, even when it's busy. And for the quality of food you get, that's a-ok! And more important than speed is personality. Every person I've met at this Cheba Hut is outgoing, friendly, and awesome.

- The munchies here are abso-freakin'-lutely phenomenal. You'll notice the regular rice krispie treats tend to be out fairly often; there's a reason for that. OMNOMNOM!

THE BAD
- The price. While I don't mind paying it since it's worth it, I can say it is a bit on the pricier side for a sub, and can't blame anyone for complaining about it. Particularly since it's a college crowd and many college students pinch pennies, this price makes it a bit harder to come here too often.

THE UGLY
- The menu. Because it's so big it's almost overwhelming when you're not in the, ah... right state of mind. But it's manageable once you've been here and have your go-to sub! :)"}
{"text":"Everything is good: food, service and atmosphere. I always go for the Italian and load it up with giardiniera peppers and it's good to go! Can't wait to get back there again!"}
{"text":"roll, roll, roll your joint. twist it at the end. take one puff, that's enough. pass it to a friend. 

ya sonnnn, i love this place. that song gets stuck in my head every time i go to cheba hut... the same way the jingle bells gets stuck in my head during christmas. i'm festive that way. 

i like the chicken with marinara on garlic herb. i add black olives, parm and oregano. 

ya son. 

then i top it off with a bite of one of their crazy rice krispy treats- reeces puffs, coco krispies and cinnamon toast crunch joined together by holy matrimony (aka marshmellow cream) is my idea of the perfect cereal  menage a' trois. those weird little kelloggs elves have NOTHING on the cheebs concoctions. 

i love people watching here, is everyone high except for me? the employees are so nice. i genuinely think they care when they ask me how my day is. so sincere. and they ask for my ID, so thumbs up on preventing theft. 

however, since im the only sober person there i have noticed the dust bunnies accumulating on their toaster. time to dust."}
{"text":"Everything is great ...Atmosphere,  food , price, customer service, except when they deliver, they get it wrong. I have had almost every sandwich an d they're all amazing. So go in don't get delivery."}
{"text":"It was late on a Sunday, so my options for finding dinner in an unfamiliar city was limited. Saw Cheba Hut was open and decided to stop in. When I saw the hilarious weed related names, I laughed in disbelief. I was shocked to see an establishment like this in Arizona, especially when I saw a huge joint (or was it a blunt, I have no idea!) hanging from the wall!

There were tons of delicious sounding sandwiches, but I ended up going with the Chicken Bacon Salad. It was pretty standard - nothing amazing, but it still hit the late night spot! The star was definitely the ranch, which is apparently made in house. Such a nice touch.

Sad I didn't get to try one of their sandwiches, but I guess that means I'll just have to come back!"}
{"text":"So so so good! I have the 5-0 (blunt) and my husband had the Kali Mist (pinner) and both were AMAZING!!!!

The staff was super nice and their pineapple tea is OMG!

I am 6 months pregnant and I approve. I shall me back. 

Thanks guys."}
{"text":"This place is quite underwhelming.  Every three months or so, the thought comes up, \"I haven't been to Cheba Hut in awhile.\"  And I go there, apparently not remembering why I hadn't been there in three months.

Why is that?  Because the sandwiches are small, the meat is sparse, and the prices (and possibly staff) too high.  Yeah, their gimmick is fun, but if you want a good, well priced sandwich, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"No offense, but the wait for delivery was 70 minutes already. They're late. So I can't even comment on service today yet. The last time I ordered the sandwich was subpar and the salad was basic. That was a 45 minute wait. Okay. Not really worth the price. Last, if you're going to offer delivery, you may want dedicated drivers. That probably just deliver. I have a feeling they don't. Mid rant update: called. The guy who answered the phone has terrible customer service skills and doesn't know how to deal appropriately. On top of my 85 minute wait, it will now be 20 more minutes. It shouldn't take 2 hours to deliver a sandwich when your store is a mile away from your customer. I should have just driven somewhere but Friday busted ass at work all week lazy. Ooopsies.  not worth the hype and you should probably never order delivery. That's my advice. New rant...it's been about two hours now. But the guy on the phone offered to comp my next meal. And food showed. Thank you"}
{"text":"BEST SANDWICHES EVER!! Hands down this place is #1. Better then any of the competitors by a long shot. I was skeptical just because the decor isn't my style, but they proved me wrong. I always get the afghani on garlic bread \"fully loaded\" and I'm never disappointed. If it were closer I'd eat there every day! But I will go out of my way to eat there as often as possible!"}
{"text":"Literally my favorite sandwich place. The vibe is really just a cherry on top of the sandwiches because the quality of the food trumps it all. Not to mention their munchies are a dessert made in heaven. I've loved this place and their food for years and am happy to be a loyal customer. There have been many upgrades to the place including a bar, video games, and a revamped inside decor. Happy customer for life!"}
{"text":"GREAT SANDWICHES! Trust me, these guys know about being hungry. The place is part of a great chain concept and is growing tremendously! The food has crazy amounts of flavor and they have the best snacks! Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ordered 4 sandwiches to go, all WRONG orders..$27.00+ for a bunch of crappy sandwiches.
Do NOT go to CHEBA HUT!!

You make Subway look good!"}
{"text":"First off, Cheba Hut is literally my favorite place to get a sandwich but something is sort of off about this location. I just moved to Tempe, i've been to this location about 4 times now & every time something went wrong. First time, Onions & Tomato all over me AND my boyfriend's food even though the person at the register agreed they can't stand onions either... okay, still they continued to put them on their. No big deal, i can take them off... but it's not my fav thing to do. Third time I received a long red hair in my sandwich that I should have called and complained but I work in the business and I sort of avoid that sort of thing, just throw the sandwich away. gross. but after last night i think i'm done.... continued to put everything on my sandwich I didn't want & I was the only order... took them 4 mins to make my sandwich & had everything I HATE on it. thanks guys."}
{"text":"After having frequented the Mesa location, I went to this one with high hopes and was slightly let down. First of all, the location is kind of sketchy. It's in an uninviting strip mall that had a series of questionable people floating about. Meh, that's not really anybody's fault but if I go there again I definitely won't make it a night trip. 

My sandwich wasn't bad, but it was a little dry compared to the ones I'd ordered at the other location. I also thought the decor was lacking in comparison and the employees didn't seem quite as welcoming. Maybe I just went on an off night. I'll still give it another shot, this time while the sun is out."}
{"text":"I LOVE this location! Sammiches are amazing and the decor and music are really awesome. I'm a sucker for ham and pineapple so that pakalolo sandwich is my favorite. The employees are really friendly and are always in a good mood. It's cool to be greeted by the people at the register as well as the ones making the delicious sammiches. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Went here for an afternoon snack, and was really excited about every aspect of the restaurant. Somehow, my la canna sandwich was just so-so, but I'm pretty sure I suffered from a case of ordering the absolutely worse thing on the menu... 

To anyone that hasn't been here, go to the website before you order. They have really great pictures of every sandwich. I wish I knew that before ordering...

I'd definitely give this place another shot, especially for some of those cereal bars!"}
{"text":"Cheba Hut has my favorite sandwiches in the Valley. Everything here is made with care - the employees never skimp on ingredients or mess up an order. The tables are always clean, the employees are pleasant, and everything from the hilarious decor to the food itself seems to have a friendly aura. They even have Mountain Dew, which thrills my green-blooded boyfriend. :-)
My go-to sandwiches are the Griefo (toasted vegetarian with cream cheese) and the Panama Red (chicken Parmesan). The garlic sandwich bread is to die for. I highly recommend this (heh heh) joint!"}
{"text":"Great food! Terrible service. I work for a Dispencary and we love their food and sacrifice one of our workers to take an extra long lunch and for us to be short handed for extra time just to get some Cheba. These past two visits have been so terribly messed up. This second time being the worst. 4 out of 6 sandwiches actually made it to us and they weren't even made like we asked. I though at this point that since they do deliver the very least they could do is drive the sandwiches to us but the \"manager\" which seemed completely unbothered by the whole ordeal kept telling me we were out of their range (by like 2.5 miles btw). I kept telling him I was quite aware of the distance because well WE JUST DROVE THERE AND DIDN'T GET WHAT WE ASKED AND PAID FOR. He swore he could give me store credit for next time but that's no good when you have an 8 hour shift with no food after you paid for it... We'll be visiting tempe location until the new one by us opens up because these guys just can't do their job right anymore beside our two incidents, our friends down at another Dispencary by us had two different incidents similar to this and the Cheba worker gave them an exta cookie to make up for their mess ups..."}
{"text":"They became cheap. They fucked up my order. Don't come here if you hungry. Guy at the cashier was cool but my sandwich was dry"}
{"text":"My normal sub place has always been quiznos.  I heard about cheba hut from a friend.  I figured, what the heck?  Ill give it a try.  Glad I did because WOW.  Subs were awesome.   It has a weird \"get high\" type of vibe to it, which I don't really know how \"getting high\" and eating a sub relates but, whatever....enough rambling on....Subs are delicious period.  They have a few convenient locations you can hit.  Use google maps on your smart phone and have a great lunch or dinner.   Yay! Im a fan."}
{"text":"Delicious toasted subs. Great taste, pleasant staff and lots of choices. Don't miss out on the Goo Ball! They also have a bar and TVs if you want to hang out and chill.
Recommend."}
{"text":"I love this fucking place. Good food and good vibes. My man Miguel, aka New York, is always friendly and attentive to my bartending needs."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! My fiancee and I stopped here to eat after a long drive from California. The first point of contact was the person taking our order and he was friendly and helpful. They have a good menu selection with a wide variety of options. Our sandwiches were delicious and filling. Everything tasted fresh. Next time we visit we will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"My Second Cheba Hut visit....hit the other one in SD.

WOW...another 5 star place."}
{"text":"Went to the Cheba Hut on Sahara and rainbow today after visiting the source dispensary with my friend Maria . Such an amazing sandwich place! This is a definite do over and a new favorite on the west side. The staff is friendly and the ambiance is wonderful. Got the Dank Sinatra pizza sandwich. It is amazing on the toasted garlic bread."}
{"text":"Coolest sandwich/Bar I've ever been too. Wait, it's the first sandwich/Bar I've ever seen! I had the Cali Mist Sandwich and Cali Cream beer. So good! I can't say enough great things about this place."}
{"text":"So I really like cheba hut and they are usually able to get my order right, but this time was a complete joke.  Me and my boyfriend told them the order 5 times to 3 different people and they couldn't grasp that I only wanted 3 things on my sandwich. We ended up leaving and hopefully they know how to refund my money."}
{"text":"Everything I've had at Cheba Hut has been delicious and I can't wait to eat through the entire menu"}
{"text":"It's a subshop and so much more! I've been going here for years and it's consistently delicious and fulfilling. The service is friendly and the decor is Rastafarian/pothead paradise. It's got a nice bar selection and some really delicious cookies. If I'm in Tempe and pretending to be younger than my age, this place always come to mind!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The sandwiches are super unique and flavorful. It is nothing like Subway, Jersey Mikes, or any of the other chains. I've been here multiple times and I've never been dissapointed with what I ordered. Their menu is very broad and caters to vegetarians. I highly recommend the White Widow or the Humbolt. I obviously reccomend this place if you're looking for a cool spot to try!"}
{"text":"I absolutely hate toasted subs.  However, when visiting friends in Phoenix I was taken to this spot.  I was hesitant, not really a big sandwich fan, but I ended up having the Club, and substituting the bacon for roast beef.  The sandwich was basically the best thing I'd eaten my entire trip.  
The staff are nice and friendly, and the food is amazing.  
This is a must hit up place whenever you are in Arizona."}
{"text":"I'm from Virginia, and I visited Phoenix, AZ a few months ago.  My first trip after the Airport was this Cheba Hut.  I'm not a big sub person, but I wish there were Cheba Huts in VA near me so I could go every day.  The service, the food, the atmosphere are all amazing.  

The service was polite and awesome, I felt like a wanted customer and the lady who took my order was very sweet.  It takes a few more moments to get your sub here then say if you went to Subway, but it's way worth it.  The sub I got was amazing, and the best food I had for my entire visit of Phoenix.  

If you like great service, great food, and great atmosphere, you must, must, must, visit Cheba Hut.  I only wish we had them in Virginia, I would make it a regular hang out."}
{"text":"Great service, food, drinks and of course atmosphere ! I'm from the Phoenix area in AZ so it's great to see a location out here in Vegas now :)"}
{"text":"I don't need to comment on the food because so many others have (it's good). I am here to compliment the workers there. I am in my fifties and a lot of the college age kids treat me like an old lady, but not here! They go out of their way to ask me how I am and what I  have planned for the night. Love that! I feel comfortable going into a college hangout and that's saying a lot.

UPDATE: 01-6-16 Still the best sandwiches and still the best staff. However I just noticed a new perk for me. I have started going on Sunday nights and the crew that night plays the best classic rock music. I am usually disappointed when it's time to leave. Love this place."}
{"text":"BEST. FREAKING. FOOD JOINT. (lol, food \"joint\") seriously though, I'm in here at least twice a week whether it be lunch or dinner. They have awesome daily specials like ladies night on Thursdays after 5p. Amazing staff, fresh ingredients, great prices.. I really hope this place stays the same and continuous to do what they have been- hands down favorite food spot in Vegas right now."}
{"text":"I couldn't imagine eating a sandwich without meat but I ordered one of their vegetarian sandwiches and it was amazing. I also highly recommend their white widow sandwich, or honestly anything that comes with their ranch! Also make sure to get a Rice Krispie Treat, it's life changing."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches, would be better if it wasn't iceberg lettuce but everything else is amazing"}
{"text":"Cheba Hut is an ideal sandwich shop for stoners with the munchies. With a vide variety of sandwiches, salads, non-meat options, and random snacks like pretzel bites, hummus, and Doritos nachos, even the picky eaters have plenty to choose from. 
Not to mention all the extras the average sandwich shop doesn't offer. Koolaid, alcohol, a unique decor, a great music selection, and the best staff I've encountered in quite a while! 
The sandwich names refer to tons of marijuana references. From strains, the the size of the sandwich, you're bound to get a kick out of the menu!
Also, they'll make you feel just as welcome even if you're a non smoking business man in a suit! 
Tip: order the KGB, roast beef, horseradish, shrooms, Swiss, and green peppers. So yum! 
Second Tip: order a side of the jalapeño cream cheese! It's good on just about everything they offer."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome!!!
Its clean, and everything taste amazing!!! You gotta try the White Widow!!! Mmmmmmm..."}
{"text":"The food the atmosphere customer service the beer on tap is just awesome can't wait to come back here once a week to enjoy a sandwich cold beer great employees to speak with thank you to all of you!"}
{"text":"I'm a big sandwich person and I absolutely love this place. Try the White Widow. Grab a beer. Chill out. Friday is happy hour all day."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the salad I got from here! They were very friendly and made sure it came out the way I wanted as I substituted some ingredients..."}
{"text":"Is there anyway to give 6 stars???

Always a happy camper coming here, and even happier leaving. Sandwiches are grade-A and the atmosphere just sets the mood at an all time HIGH (no pun intended).

Everything is 4/20 theme which is hilarious. Music is super chill and nicely mixed. Pop culture is everywhere from your table number, to wall art, to even the kool-aid machines....YES! KOOL-AID!!! 

Make sure to check out the munchies! The goo ball is a must!!! You'll thank me later"}
{"text":"Yo fuck this place they don't events u smoke weed here. Compared to subway it was alright... maybe a step above Jimmy johns?? Waitress was a baddi"}
{"text":"Subs are amazing! Nice laid back atmosphere with reggae and alternative tunes in the background.  Staff is outgoing and friendly.  And they have kool aid! What?!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Love the bread and the Kali most is my favorite sandwich. The deserts are huge and taste great. This location even a
Has a bar. Great place for good food and to grab a drink even when most the places near the college closed."}
{"text":"I called to ask for delivery and was hung up on so no I won't be bothering them again with my business..."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are awesome! It's a tad bit expensive but at least you get a lot for your money. I've been a couple times and each time I get something different. I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered the 12\" midwest best with no onions, parmesan and oregano on half and extra pickles. Brandon fixed my sub perfectly and made sure that there were enough pickles. Very helpful, attentive employee.  Party on."}
{"text":"The guys who work there are more concerned about saying \"what up boss\", and \"that's awesome\" an their own life stories than noticing their customers sitting there for 20 mins with no food, with maybe one other customer in the store. I think maybe a few of them have fried a few too many brain cells and need some customer service training."}
{"text":"I went for the first time and was very impressed.  Hands down better food/selection/quality than Subway.  I had the GRIEFO  (HEMP CREAM CHEESE / VEGGIES) Pepper Jack, hemp cream cheese, guacamole, sprouts, lettuce, black olives, onions, mushrooms, cucumbers, pickles, & tomatoes.  I added pepperchinis and took off the pickles.  It was very delicious and the 8 inch was the perfect size.  I didn't even touch the salt and vinegar chips I got to go with it.  The drink selection was fun- soda, two kids of fresh brewed tea and other unusual drinks at the self serve.  I had Tang.  Where do you find Tang at a restaurant or counter service place.  I will go back again and I will never bring the kiddos.  :)"}
{"text":"So yea been like 3 months since the screw up of forgetting half my order and they made me wait like a hr on the return of my full order they delivered.... So needless to say ok ill give then another chance so apparently they can't take a mad customer telling them they are idiots and probably shouldn't be stoned at work. Now they won't deliver. Don't go people its a joke and full of rejects for normal society. I'm sorry constructive criticism is a bad thing these days. Great business practices."}
{"text":"Really good sandwiches. Good enough for me to go two days in a row and probably come again tomorrow"}
{"text":"You know food is good when Richard Z says the following: 

\"That was so good. I think I need to take a couple minutes to just suck on my tongue.\"

Thank you, Sir Richard Z for showing me the light. I would have never tried this place on my own but holy good god was it a taste experience. 

I could give or take the weed theme but the food is just ridiculous. 

I think the sandwich I ordered was called the Griefo... although that could be off by a few letters. But the combination of savory goodnesses made my heart melt. 

I'm a huge Eegees fan. I think their subs are the cat's meow. I also think Uncle Sams has one of those, \"don't you dare fix it if it ain't broke\" recipes going on. But Cheba Hut gives those puppies a run for their money. It was sooooooo good. So good. 

I love you, Cheba, you dirty little slut."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I eat here at least twice a week and every single time we have left satisfied! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Really cute sandwich shop. I have made many good memories at this place with family and friends. I love the sandwiches, chips, and kool-aide here."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to try Cheba Hut after hearing rave reviews about it from several friends. I think my expectations were too high. It was good, but it wasn't GREAT. The toasted subs are comparable to those that you would get at Quiznos but with some more interesting and innovative options. It was almost $20 for two 8\" subs, one fountain drink, and one dessert. The food is basically fast food, and those are not fast food prices. I might go back again, but probably not soon."}
{"text":"This is just a fun place filled with novelty decorations and pretty decent sandwiches. \"Harold & Kumar '08\" stickers on the wall, Kool-Aid available, and a menu full of creative names add entertainment to lunch.

Looking at the menu, the \"Five-O\", which was described as \"all the pig, baby\" - ham, pepperoni, salami, bacon, prosciutto, and cheese, made me smile, so that's what I ordered, on garlic herb bread. The sandwich was pretty tasty - probably on par with similar sandwiches at any of the major chains. There are plenty more choices on the menu that look good, so I'm sure I'll be back once in a while."}
{"text":"Got to love the wonderful theme in this joint. ;)

I always go with any version blunt filled with meat!

The staff is great, the food is great and everyone is having a blast. Yum Yum"}
{"text":"Best toasted subs... EVER. I order the White Widdow and pretty much stick to that. It's awesome. The cheesy garlic bread... delish! Try it with pepper jack =) This place is a regular for us when we want a good sandwich. Hey... even my mom loves this place."}
{"text":"Wow, this is by far the best sandwich shop ive ever been to. Highly (heh) recommended to anyone, especially non smokers! Dont let this place fool you. Cheba Hut puts jimmy johns to absolute SHAME! These employees are always hilarious, friendly, and inviting from the moment you walk in the door.

I get the Midwest best with garlic and herb bread which is fantastic. The chips they sell are the best! 

The have an awesome selection of drinks as well. Kool aide, cherry coke, flavored teas. Mmmm..

Dont forget to order a goo ball for dessert. Dont plan to share it either. You will cherish that gooey ball of deliciousness. I loved them so much that I recreated their recipe at home so I could share these little pieces of heaven to the world. Except that part didnt happen,  I ate them all."}
{"text":"Great place to eat baked man. Never been there sober and I never want to. I recommended the white widow that thing is killer."}
{"text":"Always good...all the time! The Griefo is an amazing sub as well as The Kind. The koolaid is outta this world!! They have a great menu with many items to choose from. Prices are kinda high... No pun intended... But the service and food are always right on!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches awesome service. This place is so chill and great.  I would recommend it especially for the food but the whole experience is awesome."}
{"text":"The subs are by far the best in Madison. My go-to is the Kali Mist - and you can add/take off any ingredients as well to make any sub perfect. The subs don't come out \"freaky fast\" by any means, and they'd admit that, but man are they worth it. So good!!"}
{"text":"This is seriously the best Cheba Hut location in AZ.

Rarely do I crave subs unless it's from the glorious cheba hut! I mean, who else puts an amazing concoction of guacamole, cream cheese, more cheese and vegetables on an amazing Garlic bread roll?!! Their creativity and delightful toastiness of their subs keep me coming back.

This location seriously has the best and kindest staff. plus they always have the ingredients to make my sub on hand. I'll be back for my next lunch break!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches always fresh and they have  munchies for your sweet tooth.
They also have delivery, you can`t beat that.

The best sandwich shop in town

Highly Recommend no pun intended."}
{"text":"Best sandwich place.... nuf said! 

I order the Midwest Best a lot but today I gave the G-13 a go...  added jalapenos too!  Sooo good!"}
{"text":"Cheba Hut is delicious, even if you're not a stoner! The veggie sandwiches are the bomb even if you're a meat eater. GO!


The servers are sometimes kind of out of it, I wonder why...but it doesn't matter that much because the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Straight fire only thing that needs to be said. 


Staff is amazing and friendly. 


Recommend .... The 5.0, Ak47, and Panama Red. All blunts of course. 


Also have multiple IPAs on draft.. Lagunitas my fav 


Have to check this place out!!"}
{"text":"I didn't want to give a sandwich shop 4 stars, but I had the Griefo almost 8 hours ago and I still feel satisfied and look forward to going back (probably tomorrow).  The Griefo is vegetarian (not vegan), by the way, and delicious!  I had it on the garlic/herb bread and had it piled with every veggie they had, including jalapenos.  The theme is awesome, and the staff is super friendly and fun.  I had the grape tea to drink and was really impressed.  For a \"munchie\", I had a chocolate and peanut butter rice krispee treat.

I wish there was a Cheba Hut in Miami, but for now I will be sure to visit whenever I am in Arizona."}
{"text":"Great time! The food is always good, I enjoy the interaction with the employee for suggestions to food. He also made sure I got what I ordered! They hired some good looking workers! Great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"This is THE Sandwich shop you want to go to. This shop beats any other sandwich shop for me. I've tried...I've tried to enjoy other places but Cheba Hut always calls my name. I love their pakalolo and their Greek Chicken. I can't say enough good things about this place and recommend it to family and friends who are in the mood for subs."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches! All sandwiches I've tried have been good but my favorite is the Midwest best add honey mustard. It's a very interesting restaurant on the inside considering everything has to do with marijuana but the food is good!"}
{"text":"Awesome food selections. Food was very delicious. Their service is great and the atmosphere is unbelievable. This place is our place of choice when wanting subs."}
{"text":"A favorite go-to for a delicious sandwich. Their sandwiches are made with the kitchen sink approach and it works fantastically. Everything looks great, but I can't seem to stray from the veggie and guac Humboldt. Love the friendly workers!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here as often as possible. In fact, any time we're trying to decide what to eat and he says \"how about sandwiches?\" I light up because Cheba Hut is the ONLY sandwich shop, and I'm always down. Typically I get the \"5-0\" on herb and he \"The Kind\" on wheat. Today, however, I was in for a special pulled pork treat that was just introduced. Lord help me but I can't remember what it was called...
On it was pulled pork, arugula and one of those purple leaved greens, cilantro, pickled onions, sriracha aoli, mayo, jalapeño... And probably cheese i dont know.  What I do know is that was the best damn pulled pork sammich I have ever had. I will have a fit if they don't put it on the menu permanent style. 

-in love"}
{"text":"Best place ever! Don't sweat the small stuff! The vibe is priceless and they have good beer!"}
{"text":"Always loved this place and food. 

They do need to learn how to properly make a sticky Icky. 

Sad. It's the easiest sandwich on the menu but my mouth and lips are one fire 

CLEAN KNIFE AND BOARD. That's all it takes. Makes me wonder how clean y'all are. 

I was just in the ER for eating a few bites of Chipotle's new queso, it's not even spicy but I'm allergic to some of the spice. 

Now I have some spice in my body and I have no idea what it is."}
{"text":"Been coming to Cheba Hut since my days at MCC circa 2005. I remember coming here and being thoroughly entertained by their menu items, descriptions, and blatantly obvious stoner decor. Baffled at how I haven't written a review for them after all these years...must of slipped my mind haha

Sub sizes come in 4\", 8\", or 12\", AKA a nug, pinner, or blunt, respectively.  Each toasted sub is creatively named after, you guessed it, weed! My favorites are White Widow, Griefo (veggie only), and The Kind. I love seeing all of the novelty stickers, photos of past customers, and scribbled in messages on the counter--gives me nostalgic, warm, fuzzy feelings. The atmosphere is laid back. 

Everyone that works here is super chill, and provide quick and friendly service. They also deliver, which I have used their delivery service without any issues. Their motto is \"if you're high, we'll fly, safety first!\" Wise words. This place is a fun spin on toasted subs \"where the only thing fried is an occasional customer\". 

If you've driven by and saw there magical love bus parked outside and wondered if you should try, just do yourself a favor and experience the clever concept that is Cheba Hut. It's one of a kind!"}
{"text":"I ordered a sandwhich an hour and 10 minutes ago from this sandwhich shop for delivery and I just called to see what's taking so long and they were like \"oh yeah, we looked up the address and its outside of our delivery area... sorry man\". I am only 3 miles away. I even gave them my phone number and hotel info and they didn't contact me to let me know what is up. 

I'm away on business with no car so I'm relying on delivery. Its past midnight now (hate eating this late) and I have to try and find a way and get food. I don't usually write angry yelp reviews but the service was as bad as their 420 innuendos."}
{"text":"Love this place! Wide variety of sandwiches to choose from and their sweet treats are to die for. Staff is always friendly too! This place radiates good vibes. Raddest sandwich shop around, would recommend to EVERYONE :))))))))"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I drove by this place and had to try it. The vibe of this place is cool. The employees were very helpful with the sandwich selections.  Pretty much each sandwich and snack has a weed reference but no weed..lol The sandwiches are reasonably priced and sized. You have a choice of three breads garlic, white or wheat. The sandwiches come in three sizes nug 4\", pinner 8\", and a blunt 12\". The sandwiches are toasted and open faced. I ordered the La Cana (smoked ham, Genoa salami, prosciutto, black olives & provolone) on garlic bread. It was very, very good! My friend ordered the kush (blt). Both sandwiches cone with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, house dressing and parmesan/oregano. There's also a vegan sandwiches and salads!

I like that there's a bar and you can eat outside which is great when the weather is nice.  The decor is chill and laid back.  On Tuesday's they have a special for sandwiches and a beer.  There's pretty much something here for everyone."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this place and no its not because of the theme of the place. The sandwiches here are good. The bread is made in house and is toasty yet soft on the inside. They have a good selection of unique  sandwiches and I haven't had one I didn't like. My favorite would have to be the White Widow. If you like chicken bacon ranch type sandwiches, then the one here will instantly become a favorite of yours. The Magic Mushroom is great for a meatless option. I'm not a vegetarian but will order it from time to time. The Skunk (egg salad) is also pretty tasty. 

They also have Tang for a drink option. How's that for a throwback? And for dessert don't forget to try one of their ooey gooey munchies. Get the Captain Crunch Krispys Treats if they have those. It's like Rice Krispy Treats but made with Captain Crunch w Crunch Berries. Mmmm..."}
{"text":"Honestly, the main reason my boyfriend and I wanted to try this place was from what we had heard it was based on and we love places that play on words. 

Alas, today was finally the day we decided to try this place. I chose the \"nug\" size (4 inch) white widow on wheat bread and my boyfriend got the \"pinner\" (8 inch) Kali Mist on the asiago Siracha bread (EXCUSE ME, there is heaven and it's called Cheba Hut). The cashier asked if we'd like our subs \"loaded up\" to which we said yes. Later we found out that meant lettuce, red onion, tomato, and a big pickle in a vinaigrette style dressing which really added some great flavors. 

The style of this place reminds me of my boyfriend back when he was 16 when all he listened to punk music. The workers all had smiles on their faces, were joking with each other, and just gave the place an all around pleasant vibe to sit down and enjoy a meal at.

The drink selection was great - complete with different flavors of koolaid! What?! So awesome.

We received our subs and were so pleased with them. At first I didn't think the nug size would be enough to fill me up but it was perfect.

If you're having a hard time deciding if this place is worth trying, just go. It was way better than I expected it to be and I will be back!"}
{"text":"The best sandwich shop around,veggie friendly and unique menu.everything is good and fresh.the gooey balls are the best"}
{"text":"This place sucks. 

Over priced. Sub par quality food. But the subs have cute pot related names and there's posters on the wall, so let's deal with it."}
{"text":"Service was fast, friendly and everything was so much fun . And the sandwich I ordered was phenomenally good. I should have gotten the 4 inch because that was all I could finish. When I saw the picture of Ice Cube on the ice machine I thought I would lose it. Hilarious!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I have been coming here for years now, especially since it's right across the street from my school. Great welcoming environment and the food is always excellent. I definitely recommend the 5-0 pinned for the bacon lovers. So close to 5 stars, but I don't like the fact there was employees \"vaping\" behind the counter right next to my food, while being prepared, I'm sure there is some sort of health issue there. (For future reference) The food was good."}
{"text":"All I can say about Cheba Hut is this place is what a sandwich paradise must look like. The ambiance and atmosphere is of course VERY chill but the subs, oh my goodness the toasted subs are so delicious. I found out about this place a month ago and I have been here 5 times already. I have tried many subs including the: Acapulco Gold, White Widow, G-13 and the 5-0. All of them were excellent but out of all of them, I suggest getting the G-13 as the chipotle mayo in that sandwich off the chain! The crunch of the sub when you bite into it is what gets you. Combine that with their meats and fresh veggies and you'll be in sandwich utopia in no time! Add in the super awesome and possibly high staff (but who cares) and I wish I could give this place ten stars! Keep doing what you are doing! 

P.S. Whoever decided to set up this sandwich shop next to 4 weed shops is a GENIUS!"}
{"text":"Super chill vibe bro.  I had a sub with pineapple and jalapenos on it.  Delightful! This place is affordable and you more than what you pay for.  Better than JJ, Quiz, Subway, etc."}
{"text":"NO STARS CHEBA HUT. Food is the bomb as always but everyone working there needs to get it together and speed it up. About ten years ago when I used to come here in college constantly homeboy behind the counter was super fast and everyone was really nice. Tonight it took an hour for sandwiches to come out for the four of us that were eating there. So disappointing. What happened to this place??? Boo."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Cheba Hut since I was a freshman in high school. During that time, it was simply because I enjoyed the novelty of the place, and the food was good. Now I return simply for the amazing sandwiches.

The entire menu is great. Everything is fresh. Great sides like fruity pebble marshmallow treats. Great staff. Great music. All in all, amazing sandwiches in a relaxing, friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love that this is stoner themed! Hubby and I were driving when this place first opened and he spotted it out and I decided to Yelp it to see. It was always so out of the way so we never needed up going. I was running some errands a couple weeks ago & was in the area so I finally got to try it :) I got the white widow with no pickles & no tomatoes. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Met a friend from Tempe here for lunch.. 
First timer at Cheba hut so I was taken back by the menu!! 
Chose the Kali mist and blunt sized it. 
Awesome sandwich my only critique would be more meat... But I think it's a great sandwich regardless. Bread was great. 
Grabbed a brownie to go.. Kind of a let down... You think with the theme of the restaurant that they would have some killer brownies.  Not so much."}
{"text":"Unfortunately these people have absolutely no idea what they are doing!!! I have ordered delivery from them for about 6 months now and all of a sudden they refuse to do it. So I must be crazy that they have been here so many times before. It says on yelp that they deliver but I guess they are either liars or lazy!!! I live 3 miles away! How effing ridiculous. Their food is not that great that they can afford to turn people away. Not to mention that I am in the restaurant industry and therefore an amazing tipper. So you just lost your employees money as well. Thanks for sucking at life!!! Guess I'll take my business elsewhere and tell everyone I know just how bad you guys suck!!!! My friends that are here and wanted food as well will be leaving bad reviews and won't go to you ever again. This is an example of how false advertisement and networking will ruin you."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and halarious.  The staff are 420 friendly.  This cannibis inspired and themed restaurant / sandwich shop is amazing.  You order at the counter from one of their super high super friendly staff and they bring out your food when it's ready.  They give you a hip table sign stand instead of the traditional number system found in other restaurants to place on your table. The sandwich sizes are a Pinner, Dube and a Blunt instead of small, medium and large.  All the menus items are named after a strain of cannibis making it super funny when ordering. For example I had the Kali Mist Blunt.  It's an incredible chicken sandwich with tons of toppings to choose from.  I ordered mine with no jalapeños or onion.  It's was delicious!  I like the one size drink glass and the ice tea, soda and water machines are pure your own so you can try a couple of things or get refills.  It's the only place I know that has grape punch.  So, so, so evil bad but so, so, so yummy good!  Ok and the desserts are holy frigin bat balls to die for!!! Drool provoking combinations baked in the form of ginormous riscrispy squares will make your mind explode on contact.  The art on the wall and the vibe with the staff will help peice your mind back together and make for a fun, positive environment. Perfect place to grab some food and or a drink and soak up the ambience.  It's located on south Rainbow in the same shopping place as The Souce Dispensary.  Coincidence?  I think not!  I wish they had more locations but it doesn't matter what side of town you're on or visiting from out of town put this on your fun foodie list and roll with it. You won't get burnt!  Lol. Sorry couldn't resist. I know keep my day job....lol"}
{"text":"I don't know why people hype this place so much.

The bread is usually stale. 

Just because they blantently propagandize herb doesn't make it good.  Subway is just as legit. 

Plus it's a bit dirty.  What do you expect from an entirely baked work force.  If you find yourself in the vicinity of cheba hut, go to the Pasty."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sub places for sure. They have such an assortment of sandwiches, the subs are all toasted, and you can fix them up with whatever you want. Way more options than subway. The food and meats are fresh. The food doesn't even really compare to most sub shops. The only thing that sucks about this location is the seating. This place is really small, so it's only good for you and a friend, unless you want to sit on the wall bar. 
I crave this place all the time though...so I go there often, despite the seating."}
{"text":"Cheba Hut is the culinary equivalent of writing 4:20 on your binder.  Each time I enter, I wince with embarrassment as I see the walls littered with marijuana-themed posters and action figures.

I have a personal theory that most of the drug slang this place uses comes from those awareness pamphlets that they hand out at high schools.  The reason being, their slogan is, \"Where the only thing fried is the occasional customer,\" and they toss other puns around like \"toasted.\"  I don't think anyone's referenced someone as being \"totally fried\" or \"toasted\" for a good 25 years or so.  Their interpretation of stoner culture is very much whitewashed and made fun for the whole family.

The ambience is not very pleasant if you are, in actuality, stoned.  They usually blast heavy metal really loud.  Even worse, it's a heavy metal radio station so you also get to hear idiotic radio banter.  Talk about a buzzkill!

On the flipside, Cheba Hut's sandwiches are really good.  They are delicious.  There's no doubt about it.  I remember the first time I came in, they asked me what kind of bread I wanted and I asked what my options were.  The cashier told me they had garlic bread.

I then said, \"Whoa, that sounds bomb.\"

He then said, \"Yeah.  It is.  It's really bomb.\"

You know what?  He was right.  I always have to fight rolling my eyes, though when I look at the menu because, man, every single thing is pot-themed.  It gets to be a bit much and I always feel like a jackass when I order, \"Yeah, uh, could I get an 8 inch endo?  Duhhhhhh....\"

I do also like that there's only one drink size.  I don't have to put any thought at all into what lid I'm going to put on my cup.

Cheba Hut in a nutshell:  Embarrassing theme, really good sandwiches."}
{"text":"I don't want to write a long drawn out review describing every moment of my many experiences at Cheba Hut... 

Just go. 

It's good. 

Seriously."}
{"text":"The hubby and kid liked it but I felt like the sandwich was too salty. We had gotten a 12in Apollo 13 and the teriyaki chicken one and both came out to $20 which I thought cost a little much, but the sandwiches were a little big.  

The place itself is loud and guys working were just kinda there. They weren't rude or anything,  but they weren't actually nice either. All seem like stoners, but, I guess that fits in with the theme.

They have quite a bit to choose from and serve sweets and even kool aid, but I dont see myself returning."}
{"text":"This is the best place for stoners to eat! okay and everyone else though too! The food is amazing all hand made sauces and shit.
The goo balls are my favorite!! Fav sub would have to be the Thai stick. They have 3 different kool-aid flavors and a bar!
A great place to go!"}
{"text":"The best sandwich place hands down in the state of Arizona ! I always get the Midwest best fully loaded Absolutely love this place !"}
{"text":"Wow, not normally do I get hungry and drive down the road to find a place that not only sounds interesting but was worth the try. Everything from the fun stoner atmosphere with Simpsons, American Dad and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas themed walls to the very Spliffy menu items with their 4\" nug - 12\" Blunt sandwich sizes and their strain inspired sandwich names. 
I got the Kali Mist which is a California turkey club and I go it with a garlic toasted roll. So damn good! 
I was very pleased with it not only in flavor but if these guys consistently have fresh delicious rolls like I had tonight, I will keep coming back. 

Only thing I will say, as a personal preference that is, the cheese tasted excellent but it was a little much cheese for me and that doesn't say much. I don't like as much cheese as most people do so take that with a grain of salt. I think most people who love California clubs would absolutely love this with the garlic toasted roll I got. 
So go here toasty or sober as a bird! You'll love it either way if every night is like my experience this evening. 
Miguel, the bartender, was also real chill and a good dude. I should also mention this place has craft beer and Cocktails. Can not beat it!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Cheba Hut. I am in love with this sub shop. Have not tried anything I didn't like there. My only complaint is there aren't more around the valley as I do not live is relatively close to either location."}
{"text":"Tried to order a $39 meal for my friends and I in the middle of lunch rush hour and got turned away because they couldn't break a $50.  Ruined my lunch break, thanks."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were excellent. No more Cappriottis for me. The price is reasonable. I tried the notch a and they were delicious."}
{"text":"I love Cheba Hut.  Their product is on point, and their staff is always super friendly and helpful.  Their food is delicious and interesting, not to mention those are some of the prettiest sandwiches I've ever seen.  Great atmosphere, very chill and fun.  My only complaint, is I wish they had a wider delivery area."}
{"text":"This place has a great menu and cool design. 

It's a stoner / sub shop that will
Leave you Happy and full. 

Toasted subs , tons of toppings and 3 different koolaid flavors! Also awesome marshmallow cereal bars for dessert. 

Def check this place out!"}
{"text":"Calling all stoners, Calling all stoners. Well ok not just stoners because the food here is awesome for those of us who aren't stoners too.

The menu names will make you feel like you are breaking the law just by ordering a La Canna Blunt or a Kush piner but the only thing illegal about these is how good these \"toasted\" subs taste. No matter what your mental state when you get one of these you will chow them down like you haven't eaten in day.

My personal favorite is the aforementioned La Canna fileld with your usual selection of italian meats and olives, throw on some of there pickles and you have a tasty snack to munch on. 

Don't forget to order one of their special brownies filled with all kinds of chocolatey fudgey goodness when you get the dessert munchies."}
{"text":"12/10 overall experience every time. My absolute favorite sandwich shop to ever exist. I went everyday once for 3 weeks. Not only is their food delicious but the employees couldn't be more attentive and kind. This place really values their customers satisfaction to the full extent. Greatest customer service I've ever received. I hope to see this company grow in years to come!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the sandwiches n the service was good, if anything that was \"bad\" i guess the music was a little loud but no biggie. I got the club n in a 12 in very Yummy"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich place!!! I love the kush (BLT) and my kid enjoy the meatball sandwich. The atmosphere is family friendly. They have an assortment of craft beer, which is always nice. Their brownies are phenomenal. The service is amazing. The entire staff are friendly, upbeat, and seem to enjoy their job!! We always have an awesome time and I love taking friends and family here when they visit!!"}
{"text":"Friendly but slllooowwww staff.  Their subs aren't all that great.  Guess you gotta be high to think they're even the slightest bit good.  Either that, or maybe the koolaid would've helped."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It has a great, chilled atmosphere (the style is definitely catered towards a college audience). The atmosphere itself could win me over.

The first time around, I had their jerk chicken sandwich (which was okay, and I didn't really care for it). During my recent visit, I got the BBQ chicken with double meat - the sandwich was loaded to the max! I was really impressed at how good it was. The chicken was completely tender (unlike the first time around) and moist and everything on the sandwich complemented each other. The bread was extremely crunchy to contrast the sauce in the chicken. They also have some creative twists on the regular Rice Krispies as they incorporate different cereals into the mix as well.

TBH, cheba hut is not my favorite stop for a sandwich, but it is better than most."}
{"text":"If you're hungry and need a quick bite, get the White Widow. The vibe is fantastic, never disappoints. Also, they serve alcohol now. I've been coming here for years and definitely prefer this location to the Dobson one."}
{"text":"College kids infatuated with Tommy Chong and the whole pot culture aren't the most discerning food enthusiasts.  This place fits them well.  For the rest of us, it is a decent sandwich in a very cramped space."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the coolest theme ever! From the names on the menu to the decor. I was in sensory overload the whole time, taking everything in.

The service was A+. Everyone was very friendly and I had 3 different employees walk by our table and ask if we needed anything.

Now to the food. I've only tried two toasted sandwiches from here but both they should be the bar for normal priced sandwich shops. Only complaint I have is that I ordered a large(blunt). Combined with the extra sauce I added, it was falling apart the whole time. No worries, it was delicious enough to eat the remains with a fork.

Will 100% be back."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches great place to eat . They have Kool Aid in the foutain machine.  Get a blunt or get a pinner if you want a small sandwich.  This place rocks the people are awesome ."}
{"text":"You mightal think the food is a joke being all about weed and everything but let me tell you this food is amazing. One of the best subs in Vegas hands down"}
{"text":"SO FREAKING GOOD. Not only do they deliver if you're unable to drive *hint hint* but their sandwiches are just ridiculously good. All of their homemade sauces are delicious and the bread is so crunchy! I recommend getting the Midwests Best or the Thai Stick. Oh and whoever created the Goo Balls is a god. Those things taste like pancakes, cocoa crispies, waffles, and a peanut butter & honey sandwich, ALL IN ONE GOOEY BALL!"}
{"text":"These sandwiches are kush!!!  Staff is great, ambiance is entertaining and they have a fun selection of beers!!!"}
{"text":"I was craving a sub sandwich at around 8pm after my husband got out of work, while most places are closed for the day Cheba Hut remains open until the wee hours of the night lol 
Was not initially a fan of the white widdow, waaayyy too much ranch dressing for me personally, ate half and saved the rest for the next day, after the bread soaked up the excess dressing the sub was actually quite good. 

My fav and my husband's as well is the 5-0, a little spicy since they add bits of jalapenos but I like that. 

The AK aka french dip, the dipping broth was heavily salted and tasted more like a half cup of water mixed with a heaping serving of generic beef bullion. It was a hard pass for us. 

The kool-aid fountain drinks were a delightful suprise?

Overall, aside from the decor .... this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"After a night out drinking and being completely hungover my GF and just wanted to relax in bed all day, order a bunch of food and watch movies.  I've heard great things about the food at Cheba hut so we decided to give it a shot.  The girl that took our order struggled a bit to get it right, although it wasn't difficult, the 5-0 in the mist with no tomatoes, the AK-47 with aus jus dipping sauce, nachos and a rice crispy treat.  The food came pretty quickly, about 30 minutes, but one sandwich was loaded with tomatoes, and the other was missing the aus jus sauce, so 0 for 2 on the sandwich order.  We quickly called back and they offered to bring some more aus jus sauce and remake the sandwich.  Not wanting to cause to much trouble I opted to just pick the tomatoes off, but asked if they could still deliver the missing sauce.  They promised a quick delivery.  But an hour later, still no delivery of the sauce.  The sauce totally makes that sandwich!  Sad to say a cant really tell if you if the food was good, I hate tomatoes and one sandwich was covered in them, and the other was missing the best part, the aus jus dipping sauce!  At least the rice crispy treat was good. 
By the way, we never did get that sauce delivery."}
{"text":"One of the best subs is available at this joint. I tried the chicken sub called Jamaican Red with Chipotle mayo. The chicken  was well cooked and tender. I ordered a fully loaded sub hence it came loaded with veggies. The veggies were fresh. Chipotle mayo with the home dressing was a perfect blend. And most important an 8 inch fully loaded sub was just below eight bucks.. This joint is a must try for sub lovers.."}
{"text":"I love this place! Customer service is amazing and the Jamaican Red on Garlic Herb bread is to die for. Love the decor. This place is my husband and I's new Saturday lunch spot. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Sammiches, Simpsons, and brownies, oh-my!

Whenever friends from out of town visit, this is one of the first spots I take them to.  The sandwiches are awesome, and the environment is laid-back.  The \"Mary Jane\" theme is just an added bonus ;)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my stop at the Cheba Hut. The crew was extremly friendly and the sandwiches were awesome. Great place to grab a sandwich."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE experience today!  I hadn't eaten all day and was really looking forward to some Cheba Hut just for them to not pull through. 

So I placed an order online around 12:50pm which worked through the EatStreet app for a delivery.  I work full time and thought this would be convenient.  Man was I wrong!!!

I mean I've ordered this way through Yelp/EatStreet app for Cheba Hut before without any major issues other than them forgetting guac on my sandwich.  Not a cool move at all because I love me some avocados but damned if I don't eat the sandwich! 

They emailed me stating my food would be delivered by 1:57pm.  That's a random time but I'll take it.  Work gets busy and 2pm passes.  I give Cheba Hut a call around 2:50 and an employee named Tori says they didn't check the EatStreet app so my order didn't yet go through in their system... Just what I wanted to hear going on an empty stomach.  At least she was straight up though??  

She said it would be a 45 minute wait and that she'd throw in some munchies for the inconvenience.  I can understand how busy it gets working in a restaurant environment and she said she'd give me free food!  I can't hate on that.  I continued waiting.  

I waited more than an hour and finally called them again at 4:28 pm.  This time it was a different employee.  She said the delivery guy actually went to my location and that he called my number 5 times which is impossible because Cheba Hut never called me.  I was the one calling them.  

I've ordered through this app before and my number is saved in the system.  Cheba Hut had no problem of calling me when they arrived on previous occasions, so why not this time?  

Next time, don't lie to your consumers like they don't know any better.  You make yourselves look extremely incompetent and unprofessional trying to make it seem like I was in the wrong for not checking my calls.  

I asked for my refund because there was no point of wasting anymore of my time and she told me I had to call EatStreet.  The agent who refunded me through EatStreet was professional and took care of me in no time so thanks, EatStreet.

I ended up getting Panda Express.  Come on Cheba Hut, I need your food in my life.  I know you can do better than this."}
{"text":"Bomb subs every time!!! Been going since a GCC student I always get Midwest best and my girlfriend always gets cali mist. Love that they make \"goo balls\" and other stoner treats along with kool aid. Cashiers always seem chill so no problem there, plan to keep coming in the future"}
{"text":"1st time here and WOW amazing! Totally coming back! Ordered the Kali Mist . Came on a Tuesday and my beer was $2. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Hands down best in Phoenix. Well, Glendale. Screw it. Probably all of AZ. Comments about service. Stop being so damn uptight. They're young free spirited stoners that actually have fun at work. So lighten up and wait for an amazing Sub.  All fresh made to order so if you want fast, go somewhere else. You get what you wait for. Quality.  PS. Music selection. Spot on. Not everyday I hear Incubus (on the radio and the employees singing along) while waiting for my order."}
{"text":"I went in with high hopes, the decor was fun and certainly a hit with the collage crowd.
The people were nice and friendly, and I will always be a fan of a place that let's their freak flag high! And the folks working here sure do. +1 to me

My \"beef\" is the food. it was tasty, just fine, but the garlic bread tasted a tad stale, and I found the amount of meat per sandwich to be a little low. (I ordered a Chronic roast bef... sort of a basic sandwich which lets me see the basics of a place.
Perhaps next time I'll read deeper and try another 'wich and ask for extra meat and cheese. Perhaps their a place that only fly's when doing an insane sandwich, I dont know.


I do know that if I could, I would open up a few of these myself near collages, along with Magic Mushrooms Pizzerias and watch the $$'s roll in. 

It's like printing money.

Based on reviews, I'll try this one again, perhaps it was a bad day? Bad choice on my part? I'm open to it.
Or, it might just not be to my palette."}
{"text":"A pretty stellar sandwich. It was so good I only had half a sandwich to take a picture of. I like the toasted garlic parm bread."}
{"text":"I live 2.9 miles from the Mesa location and neither that location or the Tempe would delivery to me. Extremely upsetting since Cheba Hut will now never have my business again."}
{"text":"If you don't like this place perhaps its that you're uncomfortable with the atmosphere, not delicious hot and tasty \"toasted\" subs.  If you're uptight or offended by tatoo's and slackers, and can't handle a little \"sub\" culture experience than this probably isn't the best sub sandwich \"joint\" for you.  (pun intended where quotations appear)  However, if you're hip/down/all the rage/modish, all those definitions of cool wrapped in one fatty, or simply don't mind the MJ theme you will no doubt enjoy their subs.  I personally like the Afghani and I don't mess with a nug or a pinner, I go right for the blunt and follow it up with a brownie.  This place makes me feel like a kid and although I don't go there as often as I used to when I worked over in Tempe back in the day, I know what a good sub tastes like and these people do it right.  I think the appropriate way to sign off on this review is obvious.  Peace!"}
{"text":"I book marked this spot . I drove 30 min there but I didn't mind because I was excited to try the sandwiches . I ordered the chronic sandwich and the white widow . I dunno even with all the works the sandwich was missing flavor ? Like a burst of spread that popped ? I wasn't to impressed with the sandwiches . I won't be going  back. Cute little spot tho .."}
{"text":"Friday's are the best days due to beer discount. We've been going here for over 12 years.... Still a favorite."}
{"text":"The sandwich was as good as a subway sandy, but the real plus was the gimmick.  Billy tells me that this place used to have a truck that drove around town to deliver sandwiches with an enormous paper mache joint attached to the roof of it.  Sure enough, when we walked in, the illusive joint was chilling at the back of the place.

One great thing about this place is that all of the sandwiches are named after types of marijuana.  I got the Kana (Italian) and Billy got the Kine (turkey, bacon, swiss).  It was fun ordering and there was a real long line by the time we left.  Great place. Great idea.  Good sandwich."}
{"text":"Let me start off with, I love Cheba Hut. Some of the best sandwiches you can have. 

My complaint is recent. The past 7 times I've gone there they have messed up my order. I usually go at night when it's not very busy and get it to go. They have consistently forgotten to add toppings to my sandwiches. In some case they didn't add any. I don't know of it there no system or what.

If you get a sandwich to go make sure to CHECK IT before you leave."}
{"text":"You can't get a bad sandwich here, but each location has signature sandwiches and this location offers the \"Orange Widow\". Get it with the house hummus. 

You're welcome."}
{"text":"This place feels like it should be in Santa Cruz California circa 1991. Sandwiches here are delicious and as advertised, the bread is really good. The White Widow (chicken and ranch) and the Dank (pizza sub) with added spicy cream cheese were favorites. The nachos were decadent and salty goodness. Service was very good and I've been back several times within a month. That's a lot coming from someone who rarely eats sandwiches."}
{"text":"i don't know what the hoopla was all about to honest.  the service was good for the amount of people in line, but the food was just eh.  i got kali mist which sounded awesome.  bacon, turkey, avocado, pepper jack, veggies, chipotle mayo?  sign me up!

i started eating and was disappointed.  onions galore and lettuce to spare....but one, yes only one piece of bacon.  that's a tragedy right there.  i could barely find the cheese...trust me, i looked.  the ingredients that matter (and cost a bit more) were sparse while the ingredients that are cheap were in abundance.  

i will stick to my own sandwiches at home.  i can't justify spending $10 for a big ole hunk of bread stuffed with veggies but lacking in the good stuff :/  i was bumming hard about the bacon and still am sad!"}
{"text":"So, so dank. Chill, queer friendly environment, diverse staff (rare for AZ lol), quality, fresh ingredients. Fun cannabis themed vibe. Even if you don't smoke, put your opinions on it aside and get a yummy sandwich or one of their awesome drinks. Makes Subway look like McDonalds. They also keep lots of fliers and info on local events and places which is cool to see. Their treats are just as delicious as their sandwiches."}
{"text":"First time here, I've gotta say I was a little nervous but after I ate my sandwich it was really good! I would recommend it to ALL of my friends. Any place that serves Kool-Aid is good."}
{"text":"This is a really good place to eat! I'm not just saying this because I AM STARVING right now lol 

its Bud theme restaurant that serves gourmet subs named after bud strains, which is pretty clever. I ordered the White Widow. It is vry delicious and the comonibation of cheese ans ingredients makes it pretty tasty. They have a delicious yet simple concept which is good for me bc sometimes too many choices can be orver whelming."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is super chill with a huge jungle wall painting and Half Baked playing on a tv screen in the background. Various reggae and Sublime and Bob Marley etc music playing in the background. All the guys who work here are super laid back and good people. The guy who took our order has been here 8 years and knows the menu inside and out so I took his recommendation on the T-Rex sandwich on garlic bread. It was fantastic. Toasted turkey and bacon and pepperoni with cheddar cheese and mayo and lettuce and a pickle. Super bomb. Very unique and delicious place. Will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Interesting place filled with vastly interesting and educating vocabulary. Ordering from this menu is rare and fun experience. The staff were abundant and very kind and friendly. The power went out right in the middle of the lunch hour and all remained pleasantly calm and relaxed. Food delivered fresh and spot on. A sample brownie ended he delight perfectly. Might suggest calling in your order if you have a short lunch schedule."}
{"text":"My Gawd!  Just got a Pakalolo to go and is it ever amazing!!! I am mad at myself for not getting a bigger one.  It has smoked ham, pineapple, swiss cheese, honey mustard...and of course the usual lettuce, onion, tomato and pickle. It's incredible. And I'm not even stoned.

The menu is extensive. Lots of choices of breads and meats and veggies.  Vegan and veggie options.  And yummy looking munchies too.  If you're in the neighborhood you must stop and fill up!"}
{"text":"This place has the service expected if the staff smokes a few before a shift, based on my experience.  Very slow service even when there wasn't anyone in line.  Waited ten minutes for a salad.  Ugh."}
{"text":"Man Im ADDICTED to this place! Ive even got my kids addicted and now they turn their nose up to places like subway, lol.  My favorite is a combo sandwich called the Jamaican white widow. It is absolutely amazing just a tip, take the pickle out the middle and eat it on the side, it tastes better like that for some reason. The rice krispies, tang and kool aid are the perfect compliment. If I smoked I would totally eat here all the time.  Actually I don't and I already do so there you go! Just grab your keys and go, I promise you will NOT be disappointed. The environment, the staff, fast service, high quality ingredients and a menu full of amazing strands that compliment the amazing sandwiches, what more can you ask for...... Maybe a cheba hut IV so you can be fed cheba hut intravenously 24/7 LOL"}
{"text":"I don't really get it. I know some people love the food here.  But I've eaten here 4/5 times now and the food is 3 star quality.  The bread doesn't taste good or fresh to me, and bread is the most important part of a quality sandwich imho.  The ingredients were good, but the dirty floors and dingy atmosphere turn me off, and I like some dingy places.  

The pot theme runs strong and I wouldn't be surprised if most of the staff is high most of the time.  

The grossest thing about this place is the grooming of the staff.  I'm not really a judgmental guy, but is it too much to ask that people at least appear to have showered this week if they are preparing my food?? I don't like my food prepared by a fat greasy lady in a shirt that shows her hairy sweaty belly.  And I'm a guy who never trusts a skinny cook :) 

Totally hard to eat after watching someone like that prepare my food.  Not to mention the guys with the filthy dreadlocks and yesterdays food covered beard.  

I do have to mention that they rice crispy treat with peanut butter puffs and cinnamon toast crunch was fantastic though.  Stick with the munchies at this post 420 retreat."}
{"text":"My friend and I frequent the \"Cheebz\" on a regular basis.

Whether we're eating there or getting it delivered, this place does not mess up. The cashiers always make sure they get your order right, and they have never failed to get me exactly what I've ordered. This is a breath of fresh air because as a picky eater, I usually remove or add items to standard menu items. That being said, I'm used to having my order arrive incorrect. But not at Cheebz! The subs are always freshly toasted, and the ingredients are fresh as well. This place has literally the best subs I've ever had.

I most recently went there after the ASU vs. Stanford game, and was pleasantly surprised to see they served quality beer as well. The reason this location gets 4 stars out of 5 as compared to the Tempe location off Hardy and University, is because this location doesn't server beer on draft! Hey, I can't give em' both 5 stars if the other location has one thing I like better. 

Now I know the stoner culture vibe might be a little annoying or overwhelming to some, but you definitely don't need to be a stoner to eat here. I encourage anyone who enjoys sandwiches / subs to go to Cheba Hut!"}
{"text":"I love Cheba hut. The food, the environment, the people, everything. These are the best subs ever. My friend and I frequent both the Hardy and University location, and the Southern and Dobson location on a regular basis. We go too often to be honest!

The ingredients are fresh and I love the fact that every sub is freshly toasted.

All of their locations are incredible but this one gets the fifth star. Why? Because they serve draft beer! The beers are priced very reasonably. Something like $3. Thanks to the bar area you can get a cold one and meet some generally awesome people. 

This location is also insanely close to my house which is also a plus.

Stay cool Cheba Hut."}
{"text":"During my stay in Madison, a friend recommended I check out Cheba Hut. I had been putting it off till my last day in town and finally made it out there... and believe me, I'm sooo glad I did. 

I wasn't completely sure what to expect when I got there but spent a good five minutes just staring at their menu on the wall... Yeah, you can say I'm indecisive. After the check out guy asked me twice if I needed any assistance I settled on the Acapulco Gold sandwich, I mean who doesn't love BBQ chicken?! He then asked if I wanted it \"loaded up\" and I just had to say yes but without the dressing and it was heaven. I mean I love toasted subs and Cheba Hut does it to perfection! The BBQ chicken was so moist and flavorful with that great tangy flavor that reminds me of western Carolina BBQ... Just delicious! And paired with the Swiss cheese and fresh vegetables just made me eat the whole pinner as soon as I unraveled it. 

I ordered my sub to go so I can't say much about the decor or ambiance of the place but the staff were super friendly and the sub was amazing. I could see it as a popular college hang out spot as its right off State St. Cannot wait to come by and try out another sub the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches. also the kool-aid...and friendliest service around!!! I love the Kali Mist sandwich, and the pretzel nuggets with honey mustard are to die for."}
{"text":"I've been here four times since they opened and will continue coming back weekly. The Kali Mist is amazing. The desserts like the krispie bomb are unique and super tasty. The Fear and Loathing mural is dope. Great vibe, great food, cool people, perfect place to chill and have some great grub."}
{"text":"This place is great, they have fantastic desserts! They sell an array of Rice Krispy treat spins (lucky charms, fruity pebbles, etc) cookies (the caramel apple cookie is fucking crazy) and hot sandwiches. I had the BBQ chicken pineapple it was fantastic. Next time I go I'm trying the white widow. May go back tonight. They also sell beer which is dope."}
{"text":"Red Widow version with extra chipotle mayo added, fully loaded, will make you CRAVE for more! The 5-0 and La Canna are also good, each sub is fully loaded with extra veggies;compliment extras, upon request. Excellent place for subs, cool joint to chill too."}
{"text":"Scam! Ordered online, was told order would be here in 10 minutes. Food NEVER SHOWED UP! Called twice and was told my order would be here shortly. Had to request my credit card refuse the charge. What a hassle. These guys should not be in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"Fountain Kool-Aid!!! That's a first! Haha love it! The atmosphere here is kinda cool and definitely goes with the theme of the restaurant. The food is really tasty too! I would recommend the white widow!"}
{"text":"Meh. Ok so it's marijuana themed....and? Not much else. The food is mediocre so a bit overpriced for food I would really only think was delicious if I was stoned (I mean, everything's delicious then, so what does it matter?) Many other much better sandwich shops nearby. Names might not be as clever but your tastebuds will thank you."}
{"text":"Came back, service was on the ball and friendly, food was fast, and was what we ordered. Tables and counters were way cleaner too though we did come much earlier this time. Soda machine was still flat but didn't matter since we went right back up for Kool-aid. Win."}
{"text":"Order the Area 51! Pretty amazing with mushrooms and red onions. You don't need to be flying high to love this place. Impressive food and the staff is beyond accommodating. Order you sandwich and have a seat at the bar with some very unique beer you won't find in any bar in town."}
{"text":"Well well well...my first time going to Cheba Hut and it just happened to be 420. Probably not the best day to go if you just want to try it out - why you ask? Because the lines were crazy long and people were getting upset. There were so many people, the workers seemed a little overwhelmed and had to scream out orders 3 to 4 times.

They had a lot of different sandwiches to pick from and I decided to go with the AK-47 (french dip). I thought the place was cool and the weed references were pretty funny. My sandwich was good, not super special and not worth the 20-30 minute wait, but it satisfied my appetite. Oddly, the best part of Cheba Hut was that I got a free frisbee with my sandwich for 420. I wouldn't mind coming by again if I was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Tryed this place for the 1st time recently though my sandwich looked like it might have been good, getting my order wrong didnt sit the best with me. I ordered the specialty sandwich kali which is already listed with what it comes on it however I recieved almost every but just that, it had tomatoes and big pickels on it which im allergic to and was not listed as an item that even came on the sandwich. I thought calling the order in would help but I guess not, for a first timer I had high hopes for a great experience it just feel short and being on a lunch break gives basically no time for errors so that was a waste of my time and my money in my eyes."}
{"text":"Bomb food, great atmosphere, and you have a dispensary right next door ! I will be back for more ."}
{"text":"Stoner bashing time! I don't like to smoke the marijuana pot but i love eating the dank sub! Place rules mannnn!"}
{"text":"Best toasted sammich I've ever had. I've tried a few different ones here but these days I just stick with what I know....the white widow! This place has a great vibe too!"}
{"text":"This place is good and I like the subs. I use to go here a lot in high school, but haven't been forever. Use you imagination to picture the usual crowd that hangs out there so its obviously not for the children. But all around decent toasted subs and more affordable that your Quiznos. I'm not the biggest fan of toasted subs but I don't mind them every once in a while."}
{"text":"Are you stoned or just in the mood for a cannabis theme sandwich?! Don't worry these sandwiches don't get you high but they do get your tastebuds grooving. Make sure whatever you get you get it on garlic bread, it tops it off nicely! Bring a couple cool stickers too because they let you stick them all over the place! Don't be afraid to bring the kids too, theres nothing abrasive about the place just good food and laidback people."}
{"text":"This was by far one of the worst experiences at a restaurant I have had.  After my family and I worked all day we were finally able to get together for what we thought would have been an enjoyable dinner.  We ordered our food ( this was a hard task as we had to repeat it several times due to the cashier having a hard time hearing us.  This was due to the incredibly loud death metal music playing ).  In addition,  while we were ordering, several cooks were cussing at each other back and forth.  Because of this we decided to take it to go.   Once we received our 4 subs we headed home.   When we opened the foil,  Three of the Four subs were wrong.  My son wanted a sub on white bread with ham and cheese only ( 3 items, how hard can it be ).  This was expressed several times. His sub was oily and drenched with honey mustard and mayo.   I ordered a 5-0 with no peppers, extra bacon/ Cheese and pickle.    It came with one slice of cheese, no bacon, no pickle and it was on white bread instead of garlic.   My wife ordered a white widow no bacon, no onion.  It came with bacon and onion.    Our fourth sub was fine, however my nephew was so hungry, he devoured his.   Once we discovered the mistakes I called at 945.   I explained what happened to an associate, he let me explain everything and then said he could not help me and said he would get a manager.   After what was probably about 5 minutes ( once again, death metal blaring in my ear ) the manager came on the phone.  After explaining the whole thing again he offered me a 25% discount on my next visit.   I asked him if they would remake the order and have it delivered ( we are in the delivery area ).  He explained that they were closed and it was against their policy to deliver after 10   I reminded him that I had called before 10.   I then offered to come pick up the new order and return the wrongly made order.  Nick Hadley ( the manager) said that he could not do that since their registers were closed.  I asked him, \"why do you need a register, if you are just remaking food.  Nick then told me he could only offer a discount on my next order, at a future date.   I asked him how he would feel if he was expecting to have an enjoyable dinner with his family and the whole order was wrong.  With how busy everyone is these days, quality time with family is at a premium.  Nick accused me of harassing him because I asked him how he would feel.   Quite honestly I don't fault him for his lack of managerial and people skills.  It is most likely the fault of Cheba Hut and his direct managers

All I truly wanted was an enjoyable dinner with my family.  I expected that upon finding out their mistakes, the management of Cheba Hut would correct them, not compound them

I expect a phone call from the General or Regional manager ( I left my number with Nick H )."}
{"text":"Its been a min. but glad I stopped in for a KGB munchies satisried! Thanks and love the awesome new artwork painted on the walls. Rock on friends don't let friends eat swag!!"}
{"text":"Love this place and the atmosphere! I will say though, the blonde with the mole on her left cheek by her chin is NOT the friendliest. Her customer service was less than sub-par, and when I placed my order her responses were not quite friendly. I've come here for awhile now, and this was the first I was disappointed with the service received. Maybe she should stick with just making sandwiches, and not taking orders for people. This is the last place i want to come for \"bitchy\" service"}
{"text":"I like a good sandwich but I also like to fell safe. My liking a good sandwich and 'munchies' outweighs my need for personal safety so I always go to Cheba. As a former local I know that shopping center is super sketchy.  You see the police in the parking lot frequently and drug deals occur frequently while I am enjoying my Kool-Aid. Buy...I have yet to be robbed and I have also yet to have a great tasting lunch from there (I would not go there at night). I am a fan of cannabis culture and love the giant blunt advertising \"order here\". I also keep trying to convince my friends that anyplace that targets stoners has great food. I love their white widow, pretzel nuggets with homemade honey mustard and the Jamaican pinner. I also always stock up on their munchies, ie. I buy everyone they have out when I am there. I have tried making the same munchies at home but I can not replicate. This visit I had golden grahams rice crispy treats. Who knew they even made golden grahams anymore but yumm yumm. Their staff is super cool and make minimum wage so tip well since they meticulously make your food. Ask them to put in Half Baked while you enjoy your White Widow.  I wish they would open a franchise in Portland but PDX is really one big Cheba Hut so alas they will be my go to sandwich place on my visits home."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches ever. Awesome staff. Great ambiance.  This is our go to sandwich place.  Try the meatball, best ever."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great selection of craft beers and a fantastic staff.  My new go to place in Vegas."}
{"text":"The best food I've ever found for a sub place. Fresh ingredients, great staff, and the \"munchies\" are TO DIE FOR."}
{"text":"I've lived in Vegas my entire life and Cheba Hut is my new favorite sandwich spot! The interior decor, all the pop culture mementos and the spacious seating are awesome, but the sandwiches are the main event at this place. The first time I went there, the cashier recommended I order the G-13, which remains my favorite item on the menu. I have also ordered the White Widow, the La Canna, the Chronic and the Acapulco Gold, each of which are delicious.

The key to this place's sandwiches are the toasted buns--the kind that rough up the roof of your mouth a little bit, but are SOOOOO worth it. 

PRO TIP: Regardless of what you get, order an extra of whatever sauce goes on the sandwich, just so you can add that little bit of extra wet goodness to your 'wich.

Also, don't let the surrounding marijuana dispensaries scare you off. This place is just fine for the family.

GO EAT CHEBA HUT!"}
{"text":"I don't have any qualm about the quality of food here. It's delicious. But every time I ever get food from here there's an issue. Whenever I go to the actual location, I hesitate to customize anything on it because they usually forget it. Whenever I order delivery they take a least an hour and half to  deliver a sandwich. And today, we decided to pick it up instead in hopes that it would help. And when we got there, 5 minutes after the scheduled time for pick up, we had to wait another 20 minutes to get two sandwiches. Your food can be good, but if your service is terrible you lose customers. And that's what happened today."}
{"text":"Please don't eat here if you have food allergies, they might kill you. I love this place so much but they never ever take off what you ask them to. I order nachos without jalapenos, and a sandwhich without pickles, and literally watch them ring it up so that those things are printed on the receipt as taken off, and everytime time I get my food? Pickles and jalapenos. I tip them well in hopes they remember and it's always wasted money. 

Update: the manager contacted me after seeing my review and offered me a free sandwich to make it right and then never actually delivered"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch with con workers all the time, and they never disappoint me. Great customer service, food is delicious, food is made to order, fresh ingredients... The list goes on! Today was a unique day I went in and ordered 11 different orders the cashier Josephine was awesome and very patient. The sandwich creators were very fast at getting the orders out especially because they had the lunch hour rush. Anyhow some how my sandwich was not in any of the bags. So I called to ask if it was still there. They apologized and made me a new one to go pick up. I got there they had my sandwich ready and they gave me 2 cards for free munchies. I thought this was awesome of them to do and really listened and took care of the problem instead of making it into a bad situation. 

This is why we will keep returning GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE and AMAZING FOOD"}
{"text":"This place never fails me! The subs are always great, and the best for munchies if you know what I mean! The staff is always chill and very informative on different subs and what's popular, if your looking for a good bang for your buck, this is the spot!"}
{"text":"I don't smoke dope, and don't raise the roof every time the clock hits 4:20, but, the subs here are tasty, unique, and different.  I'm vegetarian and this is one of the few places where I actually get a choice of more than just one sandwich or salad.

Yes, the atmosphere is loud, chaotic, tattooed, and not a place you want your 12-year-old daughter to hang out when you think she's actually in school, but push all that aside and go for the delicious variety.  

I frequent the Humboldt, Silver Haze, and Magic Mushroom."}
{"text":"A couple days ago, I was at work and almost  cried because I hadn't eaten yet and I had no food to eat at work. Then I got Cheba Hut. 
I still love this place. You can't go wrong with their beers (especially for $3 every Friday) and the delicious sandwiches. Unfortunately I can't stop spending money here but I suggest this amazing sandwich place to any and every person I know. I dread the day that I don't live close enough to Cheba Hut to justify getting these amazing sandwiches."}
{"text":"Amazing toasted subs and outstanding service.

I'd heard about Cheba Hut from some friends but I've never been a fan of toasted subs.  Well I had not had Cheba Hut's toasted subs!

The shop is tucked away in a strip of shops next to a 7-11.  We walked in the middle of lunch time on a Saturday.  It wasn't too busy.  We ordered a La Canna (Italian) and a Kush (BLT), grabbed a couple of bags of chips, fountain soda.  We couldn't pass up the huge cereal treat bars either.  Snagged a rice krispie treat with reeses puffs mixed as well as a fruity pebbles one.  The treat bars are nice and soft too so you know they are fresh.

We sat down to wait for our subs but they were out before we had our drink cups filled.  They are freshly made. The bread is lightly toasted so it's not hard and chewy.  Both subs had a good amount of meats on them and the seasoning is fantastic.   They come in 3 sizes: nug 4\", pinner 8\", and blunt 12\".  We both ordered the pinner and couldn't finish.

I noticed a lot of to go orders heading out the door.  Cheba Hut offers online and call ahead ordering.    And if you haven't already noticed the shop and menu has a cannabis theme to it. 

My only complaint....  that the closest one is 15 miles from my house!"}
{"text":"Cool ambiance, great bread, little skimpy on the meat, but overall quite a tasty sammich.  The Golden Grahams / Cocoa Krispy treat was a pleasant surprise, and it was \"kool\" that they offer a few different flavors of Kool-Aid and Tang in the beverage area.  I suppose I wasn't blown away, but that's probably due to all the hype this place garners.  I'll go back, but I'm not in a hurry to do so."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches here! Our favorites are the Humbolt and the Bomb (meatball hero). I also strongly recommend their Goo Balls and fruity rice krispy bars, so freaking good!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches. Ever. You will love this place even if you are not a stoner. And if you *are* a stoner? Welcome home, friend. Welcome home. ;-)"}
{"text":"Such a badass sandwich shop! Nowhere else I've seen like Cheba Hut. Their sandwiches are on point...service is always friendly and fast, and the whole \"theme\" they've got going on is definitely comforting for any state of mind. I'm just hoping one day their herb bread actually has...well...I think you know where I'm going with that! Orange Widow is the best. Get it!"}
{"text":"Since my initial review, I've been back and back and back again. I think it's time to bump them up a star. Cheeba does not disappoint! Great hole in the wall casual chillax and eat a sammich spot. Nicest people you will ever meet and the food is delish!"}
{"text":"I stopped by the Cheeba hut last week for lunch and had the white widow sandwich. The line was a little long and the place has a real hippy type vibe. Think tommy Chong meets Quiznos.. They have Krispy treats with fruity pebbles, Rice Krispy, and Capt Crunch. Bread is fresh and veggies do not over load the sandwich. And the best part or all is..... They have TANG !!"}
{"text":"TBT! This place is so old school! Cheba huts been around for a long time. What's not to love about it really? My all time  favorite = White Widow. Dead"}
{"text":"I love Cheba Hut.  The White Widow is fucking awesome (excuse my french)!  Only been there a couple times.  Tried the Jamaican Red, which was okay, a little more flavor a little less heat would have helped it.  The pizza sub that my son had was really good.  You can't really mess up bread, sauce cheese and pepperoni though!  I love the kick-back atmosphere, the funny art, and the people that work there are really nice... for obvious reasons probably?  

Let me end this by saying, I'm not really a sub girl, but I'd go here anytime!  YUMMMM!

OH WAIT!  The rice krispy treat with brownie stuck together with PB is fricking awesome... but then again, my judgement may have been impaired?"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches!  Okay so I am convinced that in every good sandwich shop everyone is stoned (I think it's an unwritten rule) and Cheeba Hut is of course no exception to this rule.  As the name implies this is a stoner sandwich shop.  Then menu is huge and full of unique and delicious sandwiches!  I have had quite a few of them and they are all tasty.  The hemp cream cheese is the die for.  Also don't forget to grab a rice crispy treat complete with tons of random cereals thrown in.  This is a great spot."}
{"text":"Good sandmich... But now, after three visits, order same APPOLLO 13, No, consistency here. It's good but different everytime I get my sandmich,as far as toppings,just say put all on it like stated on menu and its different each time.... Lol"}
{"text":"This is my go-to comfort food spot. One of the best places to check out when you get a craving, 420 or otherwise, for a seriously good toasted sub sandwich.

The sub menu is pretty extensive and offers a wide range of culinary delight. From the AK-47 Roast Beef served au jus; to the crunchy veggie offerings that have serious flavor and satisfaction.

Check out the munchie bowl! Want to get away from a bag of commercially acceptable chips? Check out the killer rice crispy squares and cereal balls, that will keep you happily munching and crunching.

It follows a quirky \"Cheech & Chong\" motif throughout the restaurant. Which is awesome as it caters to the college crowd. (I wish a Cheba Hut was around when I was in college.)

They even have an authentic, homemade, Tiki Hut tucked into the corner that serves up ice cold craft beer that will take you beyond the beaten path.

 $THREE DOLLAR BEERS$ ALLDAY FRIDAY!!!!

For you Koolaide noodle heads, they give you the choice of a few flavors you can get right out of the tap next to the soda machine.

Awesome spot, attentive, yet laid back staff that knows how to get the job done and remain smiling while doing it... Hmmm, wonder if that's part of the motif?

So, all and all, The Cheba Hut... Rocks!

RECOMENDED!"}
{"text":"In my opinion this is, by far, the best toasted sub shop I have found. My go to Sub here is the AK47, which is a Roast Beef sandwich with mushrooms and red onions served with an au jus.
The atmosphere is that of a marijuana stoner hippie shop. The servers are always friendly and helpful with the menu and even though your sub might take a bit longer it is definitely worth the wait.
You can eat inside but they also have a nice little hideaway in the back where you can sit in privacy and enjoy your fare.
They serve beer from a little tiki hut bar that seats only 3 people, the craft beer they have on tap is tasty and cold.
If you really have a craving for a nice toasted sub I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I bought a Group on here and stopped in a week ago to finally use it before it expired.  I loved the atmosphere, it reminded me of my party days!  The sandwiches were very good and toasted, the bread was MUCH better than what you find at any of the chains.  The veggies were fresh and the meats were tasty.  I wasn't a fan of the brownies, they tasted like box mix.

I'm sure I'll stop in for a sandwich again next time I'm in the mood for a fresh made sub."}
{"text":"let me just say something- my order was a little screwed up the last time I ordered, but wow- they totally made up for it the next time! this company truly cares about their customers. I will always be a forever cheba hut fan!"}
{"text":"The place is not your everyday sammich shop but it's well worth the effort of finding and trying out. Food is fantastic. Atmosphere is friendly. Definitely a new favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Food (sandwiches).... delicious and the bread is even better.  When you walk in to this particular location you get a very big punch to the face smell of delicious bread.... That's because they have no hoods.  
    Price is pretty steep especially if you go at night when they charge you for extra sides. Got introduced to this place by a coworker and have been going since. Let me put it this way. I wish I were a billionaire so I could eat here every day! The customer service is great and their free samples are bomb! I will definitely try the peanut butter cereal captin crunch one next time I visit."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the coolest places I visited while I was in Arizona. Especially if you are 4/20 friendly. They definitely have a theme! Their sandwiches are incredible. I had the Kali Mist and my friend had the the white widow and it was mind blowing! Service was impeccable. Wish I had one of these where I live!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend Jill were trying to figure out what we were going to eat at our annual fall picnic and we decided to grab some sandwiches over at Cheba Hut. All I can say is wow, very interesting place. 

As a few other reviewers have stated, the owner of this place definitely has a niche in the market on how he explains his sandwiches. Very creative. I ordered the 8 inch Chronic which was thinly sliced roast beef, BBQ sauce, green bell peppers, mushrooms & cheddar cheese. The place reminded me of Quiznos as the sub is toasted and you can add or subtract whatever you want on your sub once it is done with the toasting process. I added a touch of ranch, some pickles and some lettuce. Not too shabby. I also got a huge chocolate chip cookie that I have yet to eat as the sandwich was very filling. Although the place was full, we did receive our orders pretty quickly and was out the door headed to our picnic in no time. 

So if I am ever in the Tempe area and craving a sandwich, I just may have to stop by and grab me an \"illegal\" sub over at Cheba Hut. The staff are very friendly and it is a pretty cool place."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. I rated it a 4 star because I Actually prefer Jersey Mikes, Jimmy John or firehouse subs more:)"}
{"text":"Love their portions and their food definitely coming back. The people are super friendly and great bartender and ambiance."}
{"text":"Munchies and much more.
The skinny 
This place is as legendary spot in az as zia records is/was not known by all but known by many. I can't count how many free pinner cards I filled up not the many times I visited this joint (pun intended) my order/good old trustee is the white widow with Jamaican jerk chicken instead of reg chicken thy refer to it as the Jamaican widow not on menu but they will surely know what you are talking about I get the blunt size (12') a little pricey under 10$ a little over that if you want a drink but they do have kool aid :-). The snacks are phenomenal they have capt krunch bars (think nuclearRice Krispie treats) great for the quality and freshness I'm almost positive they make them daily. They also have beer and liquor now which changes the whole place up to me I might catch a game or 2 this year at the bar. They also deliver and are very quick as today co workers got delivery. 
The bad 
The price seems to keep floating up and the specials aren't so special anymore step it up Cheba!! 
Overall 
A must visit if you have the munchies and big wallet :-)"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars, I would. I have ordered delivery from this location a few times and I have had a 50% success rate. On Friday a couple of coworkers and I ordered. Not only was the delivery 15 minutes late, the bag was poorly packed so the salad dressing leaked all over, and the sandwiches were missing the dressings on the side so they were dry and gross. I tried calling several times and was unable to get through until several hours later. I talked to the manager Adam who was unwilling to unrectify the situation unless I came down same day. I explained again I ordered with coworkers and he was very whatever about it and unwilling to make it right. I will never go back.

After posting this review I had a representative from Cheba Hut reach out to me directly. They referred me to the general manager Ray, who was totally awesome and took care of me and fix the situation appropriately. I am definitely willing to give this place another chance."}
{"text":"This specific Cheba Hut was not sanitary and reeked.  After I ordered my food,  I was shocked to see a staff member smoking a cigarette behind the counter! I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that I live almost across the street from this joint!  (pun intended)  Great sandwhiches, fun atmosphere, and like I said, perfect location.  

Pros:  many choices of sandwhiches and sizes
            Plenty of snacks and such
            Great Decor
            Fun music always playing

Cons:  A little pricey
             A tad less than stellar service
             Could use a good cleaning"}
{"text":"I love the spicy Kali Mist sandwich.  The bread here is exceptional.  It is slightly crusty on the outside like a european bread vs. the kind of hot dog bun bread at subway.  They dress these sandwiches beautifully.  It is my fav sandwich shop in Vegas.  I got the Kali Mist the first time and have eaten it every time."}
{"text":"Cheba hut has some pretty tasty sandwiches and I love the fact that they serve beer there now (myrcenary anyone?!). I gave three stars because the employees are always just a little too laid back and high."}
{"text":"Great sub sandwich. I recommend the white widow. I didnt care for the pretzels but the sandwich was so good i wasn't sad. Plus they deliver!"}
{"text":"Always been one of my favorite restaurants. All of the subs are delicious. The employees are super helpful in providing suggestions and will even give you little samples of the meat if you're on the fence. Occasionally they can be a little liberal on the dressings. This is one of the sub shops that dominates every major chain and is always a good choice. 
I'd like to see their fountain drinks get a bit of an update."}
{"text":"Really tasty. It may sound dumb but they craft their subs really well, it looks pretty when they bring it to you at the table. Makes it a little more appetizing. You need to study the menu a little bit, but if you need a little advice they're always really helpful. 
They get pretty busy, so I can understand the cleanliness of the tables and chairs slipping here or there. But when you're walking to tables to serve, doesn't take a couple seconds to give it a quick wipe down. 
I love Cheba Hut, certainly a lot better than the big name sub restaurants."}
{"text":"Love the food! Love the White Widow! Love the Kool-Aid! Love it all! Except i can't stand all the hippies outside that try to pedel you for money. It seems every other time I go, there is always someone asking for change. I'm a very serviceable person to help others, but it just gets ridiculous sometimes."}
{"text":"Pretty good and pretty cheap. When they wrapped the sandwich in tinfoil they tucked it inside of the sandwich? Everything came out upon unwrapping the sub but hey it all tasted good. Also, koolaid and that's awesome."}
{"text":"Love Cheba Hut. Lived in Hawaii for a bit and brought back the Haleiwa vibe. Chill, good music good food, yummy baked goods and good drinks. (Kool-Aid on tap) we got the griefo, the Thai stick both on garlic bread and when I walked in I saw the secret menu. The snickelfritz was what I was really looking for. So bomb. Plus download this link and you'll get $5 for linking a card and 10% cash back w any purchase at this Cheba Hut. It's a win win.

{"text":"-Amazing food!
-Amazing staff!
-Fairly decent prices for subs.
-When asked for your name, if you tell them your name is \"Darth Vader\", they are going to call you \"Darth Vader\". WINNING!
-This place obviously has a sense of humor.
-Relaxed environment. 
-Food is fresh and made to order.
-Fast service!
-They even serve beer which I have yet to try. Nonetheless, that's brilliant! 
-Music they play= YESSSSS!!!!
-They are involved with the community by allowing local artists and companies to display their flyers or business cards.
-Next time you order here, read the stickers they have on the glass... you'll giggle."}
{"text":"By far the worst experience to cheba hut Tempe. No customer service, extremely rude, and can't admit they're wrong. Won't be going there any more! Try to stay away from the blue headed douche."}
{"text":"I used to come here about once a week for their amazing vegetarian sandwiches. My favorite is the griefo with pepper jack cheese, hemp cream cheese, guacamole, sprouts, lettuce, black olives, onions, mushrooms, cucumbers, and tomatoes. The hemp cream cheese is to DIE for seriously! I also enjoy the humbolt, which is very similar, and the majic mushroom with sliced portabella mushrooms, teriyaki glaze, green bell peppers, pineapple and pepper jack cheese. The 8inch is soo big but makes a great and filling lunch. You can't beat the prices either. Get the garlic herb bread, it is the best. The only thing I do not like about this place is that the whole \"marijuana\" theme can get old and annoying. This location can also get really really busy and the sandwiches take time to make. Staff is usually pretty friendly and social though. One last thing is that if you eat there or have to wait for a while your clothes will smell like food :/"}
{"text":"My 'guardians' are big pot heads and this place was made for them. There's not weed actually in the food but all the sammie's are named after maryjane strains. They were quite good though. They had a Thai stick and the Kind sammy. Thankfully for reefer smokers they don't eat a lot and I was able to sneak a few bites before they caught me."}
{"text":"I used to live in Denver so when this opened it was a pleasant surprise for me! Everyone was very friendly, they even made me a sandwich that was a special in Denver but they didn't have on the menu and some how it was even better then the original! I will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I've LOVED Cheba for years and years. We've had a special bond. Tonight I wanted to indulge with my favorite The White Widow. First off we walked in and there are 8 people working and we are THE ONLY customers in the store. The TV was on with Tremors 2 playing at an unbearably loud level.(So we chose to eat outside, at least we got a lightening show too. We yell out order to the guy and we wait. It took a good 13+ minutes before we receive our sandwiches. On top of that they were made wrong (after what the screen said was correct) So we ask for a manager. He was polite and apologized that he was training a whole new crew tonight. Which I can understand our food taking 15 min when you're training someone although I saw no said training taking place in the kitchen and that does not explain why our sandwiches were made wrong nor were they hot. You just have to know how to read...it's not rocket science. I have worked in the door industry for my entire life so I know how it goes. The manger did offer us 2 coupons for free munchies and free drink....whoooo-freaking-hooo! When you spend $25 on 2 sandwiches and a drink I except to have them made correctly and he hot! I will be trying the Tempe location from now on."}
{"text":"I've been living in the Mesa area for 10+ years now and had never heard of this place until last week when some of my friends who are Mesa lifers brought it up and couldn't beleive that I had never been. Several friends joined the conversation and all said that this was a famous local spot in Mesa and that they had the BEST sandwiches. So naturally, i had to check this place out....and it definitely lived up to all the hype!  I brought my wife as well who loves sandwiches and she couldn't stop talking about how great her sandwich was. I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"A few weeks back a couple of Yelp/Facebook friends made a big deal out of going here for lunch.  Well, not quite here but a location in Tempe.  The reviews looked good but that was too far for me to drive for lunch.  After checking the website it turns out the Mesa franchisee opened this location in February of 2008 right across the street from Glendale Community College.

I got there right at midday and the place was over half full, mostly college kids but a few workers from the area too.  Things look to be in a bit of disarray but I think that is deliberate.  Because all of their sandwiches are toasted be prepared to wait for the bread to toast.

I had an 8\" White Widow (chicken with ranch dressing and a bunch of other stuff) on garlic bread and a bowl of cheddar broccoli soup to which they added shredded cheese and mushrooms on top of.  It was all pretty good, toasting the sub roll first adds a bit of a nice twist to the standard sandwich shop. Total with a soda and tax was $9.86 and I was full.

They could have done with a bit more often cleaning of tables and common areas, but this was lunch time with a younger crowd of customers. Overall I would say about 3.4.  I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Daughter was in town visiting and said lets grab lunch, my treat, and off to Cheba Hut we went, she wanted to \"shock\" me because she thought I wouldn't get it, haha. Such a silly girl.

It was my 1st time there and after checking out the menu, I went with a pinner Jamaican Red. We ordered our lunches and headed back to the house.

This was a good sandwich, it was spicy chicken breast, bell peppers, jalapenos, black olives, cheddar cheese and I added all the fixings such as lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, pickles & there house dressing. The Jamaican Red had a little kick to it, which I liked, if you like things spicy, this might be the one for you, but I kicked up a bit too and added sriracha too, and that was the perfect touch!

Can't believe I haven't stopped into a Cheba Hut before, but now I am glad I did and am pretty sure I will be back to try another sandwich soon."}
{"text":"Sandwich lovers unite. Cheeba Hut has some great offerings; almost everyone should find something they will enjoy here.

As you can read in the past reviews, they have a stoner theme. They don't push it on you, but it's all around in their locations. You don't have to use the lingo to order the subs, they'll get it if you don't call it a Pinner and just order by small/medium/large.

The staff is very laid back and will usually have a conversation with little prompting, it's one of the more fun aspects of the environment.

But what you really want to know is, the food, how is it? Well, it's usually great. I've had friends who have complained about random things, like not enough of a veggie or the toasted bread. It's never been something radical and opinion changing though. Sometimes if you get toasted bread and don't eat it right away it gets hard, that doesn't mean it was stale. 

I usually go with the Afghani, a spicy turkey sub with jalapenos. I get it just the way they have it on the menu and have yet to be un-satisfied. The service is prompt and the employees are a pleasure to deal with.

Bonus that they usually have something entertaining on the TV here, so even if you're waiting and not engaged in conversation with an employee or random customer, you'll have something to fixate on."}
{"text":"Still the best Cheba in the area! Everyone is extremely friendly and laid back (gee, I wonder). Make a night of it: go to school at MCC, come eat here (don't forget the brownie and fruity pebble rice crispy treats), and shop at Shirts 'N' Things. I still adore you like Kumar adores his bag of weed."}
{"text":"This is purely idiotic coincidence that I am writing this review on 4/20. Although I like Cheba Hut, my experience at this one was less than stellar. I absolutely love the hemp cheese which I get in my griefo. Took a little too long for my sandwich to be made despite that there was no one there. I finally came up to the counter when they called me and he basically just asked what vegetables I wanted; no offering the \"special sauce\" like the other Cheba Hut does, and he didn't ask after that what else I wanted. Because there was two other people with me I didn't pay attention too much to my sandwich until he handed it to me. A different person was making my sister's sandwich and was asking her if she wanted things in her sandwich that the other guy did not ask me. 
Long story short I ended up having to ask the new guy to add a bunch of things to my sandwich which brought the time to 15 minutes to make my sandwich. As much as I love hemp cheese, there is a point to where it can be overload. The guy didn't remember that I still have to be able to eat the sandwich and loaded it with a ridiculous amount of cheese that it was incredibly messy and irritating to eat. I think I will just stick to the Mesa location from now on. On the bright side I tried the fruit crispies marshmallow treat, it was delish!"}
{"text":"I ordered a BBQ chicken blunt, which was delicious, and a cheesy bread via Doordash. I attempted to unwrap the bread and the foil was glued to the middle of the bread. I attempted to peel it off, but it took all the delicious melted cheese with it, leaving some small pieces of foil behind on what little cheese remained on the bread, rendering it inedible. I'm a huge fan of your sandwiches, Cheba Hut, but this was pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"The tasty illegitimate love child of Subway and Quiznos, but altogether MUCH better than both.  Plus the stoner basement look of the place is fun to check out while you wait for your sandwich to emerge from the toaster.  Only three stars because of the price of the sandwich versus the quality - it's good (really good) but not mindblowingly awesome.  And not for $8.  My Jamaican Widow was good, but a little sweet for my liking.  The Humboldt is tasty with tons of fresh veggies though.  And on a return visit, I'd want to tuck into an AK-47 (French Dip) before making a final verdict.  While Sacks wins the sandwich competition for me, do not rule out the Cheba Hut as no good.  The guys working there are incredibly chill all the while working hard to keep the line moving, and the sandwiches are indeed yummy.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"So met my best friends in the world, Z and Dally, here for lunch today. I drove the 33 miles to Mesa in order to try a sub that I have been told is amazing. So, having trusted Z on many a thing and as he would tell you, always trust him when it comes to food, I was gleefully happy at the end of my eating experience. 

There are a lot of subs to choose from and it took me about 5 minutes to finally decide on the La Canna. Salami and ham with provolone and olives. Get it on the garlic-herb bread. Have the happy dude behind the counter throw on some spicy mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, oil & vinegar, Parmesan, and oregano. The sub is toasted and doesn't shred the rough of your mouth, which happens to me quite frequently. I was still not satiated after this sub, so I split the White Widow with Z. Marinated chicken, bacon, provolone and ranch dressing. Again another great sub. 

The employees were all in a good mood. Not sure if that was herb induced or not, but it was pleasant. Phylis behind the register was particularly kind. She came complete with the stereotypical stoner laugh. She's cute. 

It was totally worth the drive and I will be back in the future to try something else."}
{"text":"I had a tuna sandwich. The sandwich was OK, but it was $7.69 + tax for a something that I could've gotten at Subway in a bigger size at a lower price. The drink machine was malfunctioning, so I wasted $2 on bland Dr. Pepper. When I went back for a refill, the machine didn't work at all. What a waste."}
{"text":"These were some of the best subs I've ever had! Love the variety of flavors and sandwiches, some new, some standard flavor combinations. But my favorite thing? The deicous Hawaiian Punch on tap! The environment had a great vibe and the staff was super friendly, I'll definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"We haven't even left the place yet and had to write a review. Great menu, friendly staff and a very spacious seating area. We got the Dank Sinatra and 5-0. Also, don't expect food to come out in 5 mins...it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best sandwiches I've ever had! I tried the white widow and it was amazing! I have been trying to find a place that actually \"spark\"my interest. This food was just what i was looking for.  Thank you for the bomb food i will be back soon!"}
{"text":"FIVE STARS SUBS 10000%. We had kali mist and it was one of the best sandwiches we've ever had. It has great atmosphere and excellent customer service. The guy hooked us up with free cookies since it's Easter! Definitely stop by this place in Madison!!!! One of the kind!!"}
{"text":"Okay, why doesn't this place exist in NORTHERN California of all places?! Come on... Bring Cheba Hut to NorCal!

This is a marijuana-themed sandwich joint. The sandwich names, sizes, etc make references to weed. There's a sign telling you that your sandwich isn't promised to take less than five minutes... (because stoners, lazy, work, joke, har har)

Theme aside, this place is great! They serve Kool-Aid and Tang at the fountain which is one of the greatest ideas ever. They also serve iced yerba mate alongside their regular iced tea, which I had a taste of (pretty good) but couldn't drink a full cup of since I wasn't allowed caffeine at the time.

The place markers they give you to recognize who you are and give you the correct sandwich are so different than other places - pictures of Nirvana, Wayne's World, etc... Despite the sign joking your sandwich would take a while, I actually received my sandwich like a minute or two after sitting down, even though the place was really busy. And it was amazing! Amazing enough for me to come back the next day too.

You can have hemp cream cheese (not sure what that entails), hemp brownies, goo balls (rice krispie treats made with honey, cocoa, and peanut butter), and you can even get your sandwich on garlic bread. That's a super stoner idea if I've ever seen one. I haven't tried any of these so now Cheba Hut needs to come to the bay area so I can do so, ok? ;)

Verdict: The decor is hilarious, the ambiance is great, there's various flavors of Kool-Aid, the service is quick, and the food is good. There's not much you can critique on that."}
{"text":"Cheba hut kicks ass for many reasons but most important is the sandwiches. They havegood and creative sandwiches on the menu you wont find at your average sanwich shop. I have not had a bad sub yet and I have been going to cheba hut for about 7 years. The theme of the place is all about marijuana and all the sandwiches are named after different strains of weed. Everyone working here is very lax ( i wonder why) and all is very friendly. The get very busy for lunch but its worth it. These sandwiches are toasted to perfection.  They also have brownies, giant rice -crispy treats, and great potatoe salad. If you dont partake in the erb smokin dont let that stop you from eating here. Everything is delicious."}
{"text":"Cheba Hut makes great tasting sandwiches.  I usually get the Italian with extra pickle.  They brought me the wrong sandwich today, but the guy figured out the mistake and corrected it quickly.  The gooey marshmallow balls are to die for, so if you see them near the register, just buy one already!"}
{"text":"I hit up Cheba Hut with some coworkers for the first time last week and I haven't since been able to stop thinking about THE GRIEFO. The glorious Griefo is what all of us vegetarians wish those other sub shops had to offer, a.k.a. not a sad cheese plus a few non-hearty toppings sandwich. The girl who took my order recommended subbing the regular cream cheese for jalapeno cream cheese, and let me tell you, that plus garlic as your bread choice will put this toasty tasty thing on your mind for days after. The Kool-Aid fountains and stoner-themed everything make this place a laid-back paradise, not to mention beer on-tap. Prices are decent, too! I will 1000% be back for more."}
{"text":"Cheba hut is so good. It's a lot of food for a good price. When I go I get the white widow sandwich (chicken, bacon, ranch) and it's really good. I used to get the skunk (egg salad) sandwich but they got rid of it because apparently in the only one who liked it. 

One of the interesting things about cheba hut is that in addition to soda, they have kool aid to drink as well. Good kool aid too, not watery stuff. 

Be aware that this restaurant is all based on weed references. All the sandwiches are named after different types of weed, a 12 inch sandwich is called a blunt, deserts are called munchies, etc.

I have been several times and it's always good and the staff are always really nice and helpful."}
{"text":"doooooood, yeeeeeah, sweeeeet sweeeeet cheba.. puff, puff, give.."}
{"text":"Gotta love this place. Not kid-friendly, definitely a stoner/teen joint, but I love going here and they've got great sandwiches. I love the 420 theme and awesome hippie vibe; it keeps me coming back time and time again. The pot-related decor is just fantastic. I also really like how even after you order your sandwich, you get to choose your toppings when they call your name as they make it. Love that the subs are toasted.

I've only had the Humbolt and Majic Mushroom so far, but I look forward to trying more of the options.

They've got some good dessert/sweet treat options, too (Goo Balls all the way!). And Kool-Aid as a drink option is just great.

Eat there on 4/20 and get a green frisbee on a plate! Plus it's just the place to be during that \"holiday.\""}
{"text":"My favorite cheba hut. Super clean, quick helpful service. The sandwiches always hit the spot."}
{"text":"Always had a good experience at this location. White widow is amazing! But they started charging for sides of sauce now which is lame! Don't forget to get a brownie! :)"}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of the delivery part of Cheba Hut, but going to this location is a great experience.

The subs are to die for delicious, I don't know how else to really describe it, so I will leave it at that."}
{"text":"Definitely gone downhill since my last visit. Enough so for me to finally create a yelp log in and wrote a review. I usually get the southwest chicken salad which is, or WAS I should say, amazing! They no longer carry it, or several of their other choice selections they once offered, so I settled on an old favorite, the vegetarian greifo. Unfortunately, it was lacking toppings since they've changed their ordering/service style, and skimpy on what veggies they did remember to put on. Pretty disappointed. Hate companies that rely on the gimmick of their name rather than actual product."}
{"text":"Love this place.  They have great sandwiches.  Everything in the restaurant is Marijuana themed.  They remodeled it recently to add more tables but it was way better before the remodel. They now serve beer too which is pretty cool.  The employees are always very friendly (typical stoners) and the food is excellent."}
{"text":"We always come here and their sandwiches are unreal! They also have the best honey mustard I have ever had! They are always quick and is my go to sandwich!"}
{"text":"Love this place. They have something for everyone and the staff is great. I recently went vegan and they have vegetarian options that are easily made vegan. The staff was awesome about making sure nothing went on my sub that wasnt supposed to. They have fast service and a great atmosphere if you feel like dinning in. I have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"I used to be a frequent customer at this joint. However, DO NOT ORDER ONLINE. They don't have it together when it comes to their delivery service. I ordered online, and never received my order. Not only that, it has been the most difficult process trying to get refunded. I had to call the Cheba Hut, and they didn't believe me at first, so I drove over there to show them my confirmation email and to get my refund. I got lip service that I will be refunded, and as I have been checking my account, I find that I have yet to be refunded. If I can't get my money back, then I think that warrants a 1-star review to warn others that Cheba Hut is a sophomoric business that won't refund you after screwing you over. I know this is likely the result of a mistake, but not getting my refund shows that they aren't handling this mistake well."}
{"text":"Never have I ever experienced such shitty service but, I guess that is what you can expect when every employee is a stoner. I called ahead because I heard that they have really good soup bowls and I wanted to make sure that they had the soup I wanted before making a trip there. When I called, a guy answered the phone and said he had no idea if they had any soup and sounded completely confused by my question. He placed me on hold to check with another employee. I waited about 5 minutes and decided that I should just head that way because I had a feeling that I was going to be on hold a while the way it was already going. I literally walked in the door and was standing in line to order by the time the guy finally picked up the phone. I was on hold for 20 minutes! What kind of company keeps someone on hold for that amount of time for any reason. He then told me that they did not have any more soup and they didn't plan on making anymore tonight. I confronted them about how awful the service was and told them that I would never be going back again and instead of saying sorry or even offering a different alternative he just said \" we were busy so I wasn't able to check until now.\" I would not advice anyone to eat here unless you don't mind being blown off as a customer and being waited on by people who honestly don't seem to care about good customer service. I for one know that I will NEVER be going back and I will let anyone who asks about this place that it is not worth your time or money."}
{"text":"There are lots of sandwich/sub places you can go but there is nothing like Cheba Hut. All the subs are toasted and there is a very wide range on the menu. My favorite has been the La Canna(Italian). They have chips like lots of places do but what make this place stand out are the Rice Crispy Treats. They also make them with Fruity Pebbles and Capt Crunch. 

They do take their time in making your sandwich so I hope you have patience. The staff are very friendly and always smiling. The atmosphere is great if you are acceptable of the culture and they deliver within the area. 

Give them a try, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Out of all the restaurants we went to on my trip to Arizona, this makes the top two.

Toasty subs.  What a concept!  From now on, I will heed the call of the toasty sub.  I had the veggie with guacamole, and in hindsight, I really should have gotten a bigger one.  Maybe even a blunt.  And they deliver!  That's almost the best part.  I can't believe they don't have one of these in NYC.  This place definitely renders NYC just a little less hip and very unimaginative.  And this is in Tempe, home of ASU greeks and Wes from Real World Austin.

The counter guys are very cool and the decor is busy, but busy the RIGHT way.  The guy who took our order was a little out of his mind, but very entertainingly so. 

Apparently, Tempe is certainly not a hot spot, and if it were to be called that, it would only be weather-wise.  After all I'd heard about the city, I certainly wasn't expecting this place.  Tempe, the Cheba Hut is your redeemer."}
{"text":"Really good sandwiches I really like the vibe of this resteraunt too it would be really cool if it was a 24 hour spot tho only have a chance to go here late at night"}
{"text":"Right so, this is clearly a stoner joint, let's get that out of the way.

If you can get past that, prepare yourself for an amazing sandwich. If there is anything that potheads know, I mean really know, it's food. 

This was easily one of the best subs I ever had and I will definitely return. Even their PB&J for the kids is impressive. 

Also: Kool Aid on the fountain."}
{"text":"Duuuuuuuudeee.....this place is YUM.  Where are my eye drops?

Definitely an interesting crowd.  Makes me want to grab my Birkenstocks, hacky sack, and drum and hitch hike right back up to Flagstaff.

But really...the sandwiches rule!!!!  

The service and pricing...nothing special (neither great nor poor.)

Environment...this is a fun place to eat and people watch.  You should try it."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are delicious and different. Love the Humbolt and the Griefo sanwiches. They have good options for vegetarians as well. It gets crowded fast during meal times."}
{"text":"This place was great! The service was awesome too; workers are really nice. It's a cool stoner environment. I ordered the Dank sandwich which is basically a pizza sub and it was delicious. Their brownies are really good too! Price isn't too bad, it's definitely cheaper than Firehouse but a lil pricer than Subway. All in all, I'll come here more often especially since it's right across the street from Mesa Community College. They also have Kool-Aid which is awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously couldn't ask for a better place to chow down. We've tried a few  different sandwiches from this shop and have always been extremely pleased. The staff is the friendliest around and are super helpful when suggesting what to eat. 

The food is super fresh, bread is insanely delicous - you should always opt for the garlic bread instead of the typical white or wheat. If you like sweets, any of their dessert offerings are phenomenal! They've got rice krispie treats, fruity pebble treats, smores bars, and they're all HUGE. 

In addition to the self-serve soda fountain and full bar, they also offer a variety of Koolaids. The blue raspberry lemonade Koolaid is what dreams are made of. 

I love this place. I love their love of the cannabis culture and the friendly atmosphere. We try to pop in anytime we're in the area."}
{"text":"Cheba Hut and their wonderful staff hosted our Christmas party last night and my boyfriend and I keep talking about the food. The sandwiches were toasted to perfection, the people were super chill and relaxed and oh so nice! Yes, my work is with a dispensary/grow, but you don't need to smoke to enjoy awesome food and service! Thanks Cheba Hut, we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is basically a sandwich shop. There is a wide variety to choose from, and you can also build your own. The sandwiches are a good size and quite filling. I'll be back in the future."}
{"text":"Dopest sandwich shop in all of the land, get the Humboldt if you're looking for something fresh-tasting , otherwise just get whatever you want"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, strong 420 vibe.

It's hard to order anything besides the white widow because it is just sooo good.

Don't forget to grab a homemade rice krispie treat. 

They deliver, but expect it to take an hour if you live close."}
{"text":"Bust out your Phish bootlegs and hacky sacks for this one-of-a-kind sandwich \"joint\" (pun totally intended) in Tempe. 

Wow, that was a dorky opener. 

Anyhow, this place is driven by its \"green\" theme and everything that the restaurant serves is named accordingly. For example, sandwiches are either Pinners or, for the major munchies, Blunts.

That whole bit is good for a laugh every time I drop in but it doesn't take away from the fact that the food here is nothing to shake a stick at. Sandwiches are toasted and tasty and there all plenty of options for vegetarians or picky people of any variety. 

Snoochie boochies!"}
{"text":"I walked in the front door.  The sign said, \"Wookie Wednesday! Howl like a wookie for a dollar off your meal!\"  The guy behind the register looked down at my black tee emblazoned with a bold cartoon logo of yesteryear and exlaimed, \"What's up Thundercat.  You hungry?\"

Sold.

I'm not one of Mary Jane's best boyfriends.  Oh I still think she's pretty hot.  She's just not the girl I turn to when I need some late night lovin.  So why would a fly guy who's not such a high guy be into a place with weed up in his face?

Simple.  The staff are entertaining.  The food is good and not too expensive.  I enjoy watching pictures of presidents, aliens, and your mom (I swear, go check, third polaroid from the end!)  sharing a toke and a smile while my sandwich is being situated.

Cheba is always on my list when I'm looking for something to fulfill my late, but not too late night cravings.  Even so, I still prefer take away.  It's a fun place.. for about five minutes while my sandwich is getting made.  And then I'm ready to jet.

I know I'm gonna jinx myself... but these guys have never fucked up my meal.  How cool is that?"}

If you don't know, then you can't go!

I got the Griefo and added turkey, it had Pepper Jack cheese, hemp cream cheese, guacamole,sprouts,lettuce,black olives, mushrooms,cucumbers, pickles and tomatoes and 1 very thin and dry piece of turkey. (see pics)

While I'll admit it was better than Scrubway and Schizno's, it would have been even better if I was high. 

Since I don't smoke I'll let you all commence with your bogartin' and I'll 
have to cite all the reviews before me with a RUI (reviewing under the influence).

I shoulda bought that nickel bag form Jay.........."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their Toasted Subs are always great and the customer service is amazing. I hate Sub Shops but this place is great. I use to go to the one in Tempe all the time. Now that this one is so close to me I will be able to have me a White Widow Blunt more offten."}
{"text":"fun concept that tastes great.  Funny how much better subs taste when their properly toasted.  You can't help but grin at the names of the subs.  

Even if you don't dig the hippie theme there is no denying that this makes a mean sandwich."}
{"text":"Cheba Hut's \"toasted\" theme and winking titles wouldn't mean nada if they didn't deliver with their goods. The menu is huge (and just got bigger), and the toasted subs are overflowing with fresh-tasting ingredients. There are many veggie options if that's the way you like it.

Unlike the big chains, Cheba's employees seem to be having a good time and are always up for a chat or a joke. These guys made getting a study break sub an awesome experience. They've usually got good toons on and occasionally The Simpsons or Family Guy, not to mention decor that can catch your attention like you're...well, you know. 

Stay open later guys!!!"}
{"text":"I love a good sandwich shop that's covered in stickers! I usually get the Kali Mist without jalapeños- too spicy for me!"}
{"text":"I don't know why, but the Mesa location is better than the Tempe one, and not just in that it actually seats more than fifteen people. The food is just better there (although Tempe is still tasty). The subs are killer, the selection of chips is excellent, and their goddamn Rice Krispie treats made with Fruity Pebbles are like crack cocaine (fuck the weed!). You just can't go there when you're in a hurry, as the employees don't exactly move with purpose... but are you surprised, really?"}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to come if you just smoked some bomb Chron and got hella munchies. Roll it up.smoke it up.eat cheeba hut. This is the ultimate weed themed sandwich shop. Delicious toasted sandwiches come in three sizes (nug, pinner, blunt), I usually get a pinner of white widow! And no meal is complete without a nice selection of beverages. Cheeba hut has soft drinks, kool aid, teas, usually horchata too (hasn't been there in a while). Also, they got yum yum Rice Krispies treats."}
{"text":"Love CHeBA HUT and usually do delivery, but make sure they deliver the au jus dip for the AK-47 (roast beef dip), they've forgotten to deliver it on 3 separate occasions which was a lil annoying, other than that, this place is great"}
{"text":"Great subs!  Was waiting for my car to get serviced and yelped nearby restaurants and cheba hut looked interesting!  Loved the decor and concept of this sandwich shop!  Staff was friendly and very helpful recommending me some subs.   Theres so much too choose from so guess I will be back to try the whole menu!  There pinapple ice tea was awesome as well as there rice crispy treats!"}
{"text":"This joint gots to be one of my favorite sub shops in PHX. The deliciousness of the food and the atmosphere is what keeps me coming back all the time."}
{"text":"Large sandwiches ordered to your stoned desires!! My favorite is the Afgan blunt with ranch. On the side a PB&J joint, chips and a signature rice krispy treat! Good for meat lovers and veggie lovers alike. The service is awesome too!!"}
{"text":"Great subs and cool atmosphere! I make sure I hit this place every time I am in town. They have expanded since the last time I was in and there are plenty of tables now!"}
{"text":"As a recent college grad, I have grown to love and appreciate a well made late night sandwich. I thought my only hope in sandwiches lied on the shoulders of Jimmy Johns. What a great feeling to be proven wrong!

Came here on a Thursday night, and I fought my boyfriend on the way there; I thought it was going to be a literal hut where stoners smoked in the corner. All the workers there were very chill, and they didn't mind that I took almost ten minutes reading over every item and asking so many questions. The theme of the restaurant is a little off-putting at first, but it eventually grew on me. 

I couldn't decide between the Thai Stick Sub and the Chronic. The barbeque mixed with giadiniera (which I asked for) won me over and I ordered the largest size of the Chronic. The bread was perfectly toasted, and the barbeque meat mixed with the peppers was heavenly. The sandwich never got soggy, and the contents of the sub stayed moist and juicy. I thought I wasn't hungry, and I couldn't stop eating this sub.

The restaurant is located right downtown, and I didn't see too much street parking around. I would recommend walking there, or stopping by late night. Menu is long with different breads, meats, and sweet goodies. I was very happy with my experience here, and I plan on coming back."}
{"text":"The place is a little dirty, but it has awesome decor and vibe. Very hippie. :)
Can be a little slow sometimes, but they make your sandwich there, always get it right, and it's always tasty.
Kool-aid fountain is amazing. Perfect.
Tasty munchies when they are fresh, otherwise stale.
Staff could be more personable for the vibe, but they are all kind. 
The white widow is where it's at."}
{"text":"Awesome shop! I call in my Apollo 13 from class and it's ready as son as I show up 5 mins later. Great staff, delicious sandwiches"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwich, I had the California club. It had fresh jalapeños which made it top notch!"}
{"text":"Unique sandwhich shop..
The concept of the shop is pretty cool & hip. Hipster gathering place lol
The staff was really nice and gave great suggestions. I had the Griefo with Jalapeno cream cheese . It was the best veggie sandwhich I have had in a while. The cream cheese and pepper jack cheese gave ut a hint of spiciness. Veggies were all fresh, as well as garlic bread. 
My boyfriend had the G13, he said it was pretty good.
The cinnamon toast crunch bar was really good.
Kool aid was meh kinda tart..
I will be back to try more sandwhiches & muchies oh ANd the bar!
 They have some really unique combos of flavors of sandwhiches..."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, good food, fair prices. Great spot!"}
{"text":"You go here for the novelty....the theme.  The food always upsets my stomach....and considering I can eat Filiberto's and be fine, that tells ya something.  The sandwiches taste pretty good....but something just doesn't sit right.

But if you've never been, you have to check it out.  There's nothing else around that you can compare it to.....everything on the menu is named after a type of herb."}
{"text":"Every time I go in here I can't help but get the giggles due to the drug theme.  It's cute and I just can't help but envy the employees just a bit for having a laid back work environment.    

The sandwiches are great and I love that you get to customize them right before your glazed eyes.  

The only negative is that the dining area is so small.  You have to basically stalk tables at certain points in the day."}
{"text":"With a pot theme displayed over every foot of the place, and knowing most stoners to be quite the experts in how to alleviate the munchies, why wouldn't one want to come to Cheba Hut if in the mood for tasty food?  My go to sandwich is usually the Griefo, which is hemp cream cheese (vegan cream cheese with hemp seeds mixed in), peppers, avocado, lettuce and anything else on their condiment line squeezed into some garlic bread. Skip the chips and go for one of the more colorful side items of either a gooball (rice krispies, cocoa powder, peanut butter, honey and marshmallow) or one of their other brick-shaped rice krispie treat variant creations."}
{"text":"I love this place. Every time I come here I enjoy myself. Everything from ordering my food and being indecisive because the menu is so phenomenal, to waiting for my food with excitement and joy. Plus they make the best treats ever. The Captain Crunch with crunch berries treat is my shit! Pretty much everything they have is my shit that is why I come here! Plus the music they play is always on point and they even have a movie going! I mean what else can you ask for? It's great for families or a night out with bae! I recommend the kind in a blunt with peppers and jalapenos!  Plus chips and a drink! Don't be shy either if you can't make up your mind the staff has great recommendations! Just ask! They are super friendly!"}
{"text":"This is going to sound depressing but I'm trying to eat healthier so I came here & got a salad... it was sad because the sandwiches are SO good. BUT.... the salad was delicious. I got the tuna salad & it was very light, couldn't tell if mayonnaise was mixed in, if so, very little. Tons of veggies & tuna that I didn't even have to put a dressing on it. So satisfied with this meal when I thought I was going to be depressed, strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Let me describe this one as orgasmic, weed themed sandwiches. Yep, I think that sums it up. I don't know the name of the sandwich I tried because my husband took me here, ordered me to take a seat and a sandwich he thought I must have. 
While sitting there and waiting, I was just looking around and trying to take it all in. Then, the sandwich arrived and oh boyyy that probably was one of the best sandwiches I had in 2013. 
Just the right amount of meat, some delicious spicy sauce, bacon, avocado. I may not be able to describe this perfectly but I sure can taste it still. I just have to close my eyes and think Cheba Hut. Oh and don't forgot to try those brownie bits."}
{"text":"Damn. This place is as good as I remembered. What had happened was, I lived next to one of these smokin little sandwich shops in law school. I frequented said sandwich shop until it closed down.  My waistline rejoiced.  Fast forward 11 years.  I'm driving down Rainbow and spot this place during the building process.  Here we go again.

This joint is weed themed. Even with my lack of love for Mary Jane, I love this joint (see what I did there.). I have ordered on Postmates more times than I am willing to acknowledge.  Sandwiches come in Nug (4 in.), Pinner (8 in.) or Blunt (12 in.). My favorites are the 5-0 and Kali Mist, but I'm still working my way through the menu. 

If you are in a rush, go to Subway. Be prepared for a bit of a wait to get your sandwich. It's freshly made and things move at a slower pace when stoners are in charge. Relax and check out the soda machine and cool artwork."}
{"text":"I love me a good sandwich! This place separates itself from all the familiar sub shops. I enjoyed the Kali Mist - a California club with turkey, chipotle mayo, avo, jalapenos, bacon, pepper jack, and all the fixins'. The sandwiches are toasted on amazing bread.... definitely not your average sub roll. Partner had the Dank Sinatra - like having a pizza on a toasty sub, including peppers, onions, and 'shrooms. Amazing. There is a bar too, just in case you want a cold one with your sammie."}
{"text":"I drive past this place every day on my way to work and have been meaning to try. Was looking for something different for lunch and ordered from here. I had the White Widow...it was awesome.  Very unique menu with a lot to choose from. Nice sizes subs at a good price. I Look forward to working my way to the menu."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite sub shop in Madison! The variety of menu options is very good, and not just the usual ham, turkey, etc. that you can get anywhere. They make a lot of things in-house, including their \"munchies,\"  cereal + marshmallow treats, which are wonderful. I came here with a large group for lunch and the owners were so grateful that they gave us a heaping pile of munchies for free. It's definitely worth checking out - seriously the best-in-class sub shop in Madison."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years, and it's hands-down the best subs I've ever had. My favourite is the Midwest's Best. Pot-themed decor shouldn't put off even the squarest of people, they're just delicious subs. Don't forget to grab a goo ball because it's what dreams are made of. And they have Kool-Aid on tap."}
{"text":"Great casual vibe, very good veggie sub, the magic mushroom.  Not specifically vegan, but you learn to scope out the vegan options.

And open late!"}
{"text":"Before I ever tried Cheba Hut a few years ago, I thought it was some sketchy, hippie filled sub shop since that is what I had heard from others. When I finally decided to try this place, I realized all those preconceived notions were entirely false. While the area and some customers are not the nicest, the shop is completely different. There is a large range of sandwiches to choose from, ranging from all vegetables to nearly all meat. I have yet to have a bad sandwich to this day. My all time personal favorite is the a mix between the Jamaican Red and White Widow, nicknamed Red Widow, was previously recommended to me from an employee. The sandwich contained grilled, juicy chicken with mushrooms, bacon, and provolone cheese topped with the perfectly spicy Jamaican Red sauce. While I have never had one of their salads, I have only heard praises about them. Additionally, they sell chips, cookies, and rice krispie bars, all of which are plentiful and tasty. The prices are not bad as I can get a drink, cookie, and a footlong sandwich for less than $15 and be stuffed. Additionally, they sell both fountain drinks and have both purple and red Kool Aid on tap. 

Everytime I have visited, I have been impressed with the look and feel of this joint. The atmosphere is very unique, and not for all, with its heavy cannabis and marijuana influenced themes. The stoner vibes in this place are no joke. All the sandwiches come in three sizes: nugs (4\"), pinners (8\") and blunts (12\"). The treats at the register are called \"munchies\" and the drinks are correctly dubbed \"cotton mouth cures\". Furthermore, many of the sandwiches have names derived in some way from the marijuana theme. Often times, the employees play rock and roll or metal music over the speakers and have a movie playing on the tv there, which for my experience helps this place feel exclusive. Moreover, they often have chalk drawings on the bathroom door that are done well and have skater and marijuana stickers placed all over the store. One wall is an art piece of nature with animals toking the ganja. It is a fun place to go with friends and enjoy lunch or dinner, but I would not want to take my religious, conservative mother here. The neighborhood surrounding the store is not the nicest and some of the people outside are homeless and tweakers. However, when you walk in, it feels like a different place with friendly workers and stoners enjoying their food. 

The service here has always been on point. The cashiers are friendly while taking orders and the cooks are vibrant and enthusiastic when giving customers their orders. Unfortunately, this store gets busy with the community college campus being across the street, especially at lunch. Every time it is busy, the cashier apologizes for the wait, even though it is not their fault. Most of the time, there is almost no wait or other customers will let me order first. Every worker I have had knows the menu well and is great at giving descriptions of the sandwiches and can easily identify one if you forget the name. Additionally, the employees are still super kind when they are not working. Sometimes I will see an employee leaving to go home or on break and they are still cheerful and attentive. This place cannot be beat and the employees here help bring that special stoner feel to the store."}
{"text":"Sandwiches amazing! Customer service (Mondo) amazing! 

Seriously, this place is the real deal. The bread is so soft with a beautiful crisp. I had the 5-0 Blunt (12 inch). Had 5 meats with oil vinegar and dijon mustard and was heated. BEST. SANDWICH. EVER. Now i understand that opinions are like buttholes and we all have them. But, i really think their's is that good!

Great beers on tap as well and the service/\"at home\" vibe is too legit!

Conclusion, try em out and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I remember I was introduced to Cheba Hut for the first time about 6-7 yrs ago when I got my first job working at the mall and quite thankful for being introduced to a toasted sandwich. The La Canna is my fave! It's Prosciutto ham, genoa salami, smoked ham, black olives & provolone cheese. Basically their version of an italian but soo damn good! Be sure to leave room for their hemp brownies or Rice Krispy Bar, which both are amazing. The crew that works at this locale, is very 'lax and you can tell they have kept a constant run of their regulars there. Hell I've been going there 6yrs now!"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, quality food and *ahem* ambiance."}
{"text":"Honestly, I mostly just come and get a dessert and grape Kool-aid while waiting for my Chinese food."}
{"text":"I usually don't write many bad reviews but I had to say something about this place! The idea is cute but the food and cleanliness of this restaurant has a lot to be desired! First of all, no one in the kitchen had on hair nets! Their hair might get be pulled back but many of them have long hair, which means there's a chance hair might get in the food! Ugh!! 

Second, I order a sandwich and it had only one, paper-thin piece of bacon on it. The description made it sound like the bacon would a tad-bit more plentiful than a measly ole piece of bacon that was thin enough to see through! 

Third, the sandwich was even that great! In fact, I found it quite bland, borderline nasty! I'm not sure if you have to be high in order to enjoy the food or not! Perhaps that might give the food more flavor! 

Fourth, everybody's day knows Koolaid should be sweet and full of flavor! Even that was flavorless!

{"text":"Food was bomb AF as usual, but maaaan the employees are so pissy. I'm just tryin to munch out with some good vibes, but the music and customer service killed my high."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich place on this planet. Sooooo freaking good. Atmosphere is chill and rad."}
{"text":"MMMMMM, and I still haven't tried all what they offer. I don't support their theme but their taste and quality are good enough to keep me going!"}
{"text":"same flavor that I've tried in Mesa and what better idea than to use some student coupons? I took a german friend here and he liked the KGB! Good stuff as always!"}
{"text":"They have definitely improved with the incorrect orders. We love their subs, pretzel bites and of course the goo balls. We moved to Tempe and now order from that store instead of Mesa. We were very disappointed to hear they are only doing delivery through DoorDash so we will probably just order pickup in the future. I just hate paying for expensive delivery when I can get in the car and it's a mile away."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches, cute boys, and kool-aid. I likey."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this spot. Sandwiches are incredible,  staff is very nice and chill.  Try the Afghani blunt absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"So, you don't HAVE to be a stoner to eat here, I think just to work here. The sandwiches are pretty deelish, the service is kinda slow (hmm, I wonder why?) Whatever, it is what it is, yummy sandwiches for lunch."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches and subs in Tempe. Don't wate your money at Subway or anywhere else, this place is awesome. All of their locations are warm, welcoming, friendly, and fun. And their theme is so funny, who thinks of a marijuana themed sub shop? They do. I love the names of all of the creative sandwiches. 
If you have the munchies (you know what I'm talking about) go here!"}
{"text":"I've always held a special place in my heart for Cheba Hut. It was definitely a college staple. Who would want a full \"Blunt\" of \"The Kind?\" Yes, it may have a little of the pothead culture to the place but that adds to the appeal. 

The sandwiches are baked, which really brings out the flavor of the meat and cheese. The toppings are always fresh and delicious. Who doesn't like that they have Kool-Aid on their drink menu? 

Cheba is definitely a spot I love to hit every time I am in Tempe. The atmosphere is great and the staff is really laid back. Who'd a thunk? If you are looking for a good place to get a great sandwich, definitely check this place out. So much better than the chain stores out there."}
{"text":"I really want to like Cheba Hut... I just can't do it. I've been trying it again and again for some nine years now and I have decided it's just not going to work. The sandwiches are too bready and often too toasted making the bread hard, sure they have cute little names but they just aren't impressive. I genuinely like the meatball sub... I don't remember what they call it... the weedinator or something probably. But the decor is too much, the weed theme is taken too far, the staff seem to pick and choose who they're going to be friendly to and the food just isn't anything to write home about."}
{"text":"Best sub sandwiches ever and great vibe.  I like all the art on the walls.  Everyone's super friendly, quick with your order and they always get it right!  Love cheba hut! :)"}
{"text":"Definitely a break from the usual Subway or Jimmy Johns.  They have an expansive sandwich menu and on top of it, they're good.  The bread is awesome, even when toasted.  

The only drawback was that it took a long time to get my order, but then again, it's probably because I went at the height of lunch rush."}
{"text":"Great food but the cashier sucks ! He stink like cigars and is not at all welcoming or presentabke"}
{"text":"Hold up. Ima let you finish, but Cheba Hut makes the greatest sandwiches of all time! 

It is my greatest earthly regret to have purchased a home juuuuuust outside of their delivery area. 
Then again if I lived somewhere that could receive Cheba Hut deliveries I'd be 600 lbs and broke as a joke. 
The staff is always super helpful! I'm an annoying vegetarian and they've got tons of options for my people. Magic Mushroom 4 Lyf! And their munchies are no joke!"}
{"text":"This w as the first time I've gotten a bad sandwich from them.  It wasn't toasted,  the meat was cold. The only thing warm was the au jus.  Called to express my disappointment and was hung up on."}
{"text":"I love this place it is such a great atmosphere, the sandwiches are amazing, the employees are so chill and helpful. I do not know whether to recommend the White Widow or the Panama Red sandwich more. If you are in phoenix, you need to come in here at least once."}
{"text":"Stoner-themed sandwich shop? Hmmm...
So you park at the seediest strip mall in Tempe and there are drunk-for-three-days-straight creeps lurking outside next to a pay phone and muttering \"Cheba Hut!\" at you. 
There is a large wall menu inside that lists all of the different sandwiches with different weed names (\"Chronic (duh),\" \"Griefo,\" \"Panama Red\"). I wanted an Italian salami type sandwich with jalapenos. I belly up to the register and order the \"La Canna\" and the cashier tells me that I can ask one of the sandwich makers down the counter to put my jalapenos on. Okay? Dunno what that's about but hey, I'm new here.
Then we sit at a table and wait like 15 minutes to be called... which is kind of a long time for a sandwich. My name is called and when I go to pick up my sandwich I discover that the 15 minutes is needed to run the sandwich with meat and cheese through the toasting machine. Now they want to know what I want on it. \"Jalapenos, and everything else.\" 
\"Mayo mustard?\"
\"Yes.\"
\"Both?\"
\"Yes, everything.\"
\"Lettuce Tomato?\"
\"Yes, everything.\"
\"Onion pepper pickle?\"
We are both speaking the same language to each other so maybe the word \"everything\" disappears with THC-induced temporary amnesia, who knows. 
The sandwich itself is on some really thick bread that is toasted so the crunchy corners really did a number tearing up my mouth. Also, as my sandwich fell apart I noticed that my prosciutto looked and tasted more like cheap bologna. Yicch. 
I reeeeally wanted to like this place but since I was sober I didn't get that sense of \"ohh, everything tastes so goooooood..... dude....\""}
{"text":"Oh, Cheba Hut, how I love thee...let me count the ways: 

1) One word: Griefo
2) hemp brownies - did you know that hemp seeds have the highest, natual concentration of vitamin B12?
3) Funky, eclectic decor & employees
4) Seeing business men in suits, walking into the psychadelic & delicious restaurant
5) Being able to introduce my kids to the goodness

Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"You don't have to be a pothead to like this place, I promise!  You just have to like really good sandwiches, which this place offers in spades.  I am a big fun of the White Widow - chicken, cheese, all kind of toppings, and ask for the special chipotle mayo.  Oh yeah.  Awesome lunch spot every day.  No brownies included."}
{"text":"Cheba Hut is always great, and tonight we had such kind service from Doran!! Made us feel right at home and served up great sandwiches as well :)"}
{"text":"I love all my carbs toasted. I would rather be late for work and take the time to toast my bagel than eat it untoasted. This place drew me in because all their subs are TOASTED. Toasted to perfection, served warm, with just a little bit of golden brown starting to appear on the bread. Mmmm....heaven. 

This place has a fun vibe. Reggae music playing, really chill workers, plenty of seating inside. Their sandwiches come in 3 sizes 4 inches up to 12 inches. Nicely priced and a pretty extensive menu. 

I got the Kali Mist which was delicious. Had a bit of kick to it, nicely sauced. I hate dry sandwiches. Can't wait to come back and try all their subs. They have a fun selection of desserts  rice krispies but also captain crunch krispy bars, cinnamon toast crunch bars, and fruity pebble bars. 

Sorry Jimmy John's, Which Wich, Firehouse Subs, Quizno's... every other sub place on state street I'm starting a love affair with Cheeba Hut."}
{"text":"How can anyone not like this place?

Here why lol.

The location, the customer service, the other conveniently placed establishments around it.

This place screams awesome. Where else can you go eat good food, drink beer and then when you leave go to the dispensary that's right next door and get some recreational pot! 

Other than everything around the place cheba hut is actually pretty damn cool! And not just because of the decoration and vibes.
This place actually makes amazing sandwiches and has awesome customer service.
The menu is something new and totally different than your average subway or port of subs even kinda blows fire house subs away. Way away. Lol. 
The bread stays nice and toasty and holds up even if you have to take them to go the bread doesn't get soggy like mostly every other sandwich place.

They also have a couple of their own custom signature items on the menu I guess every cheba hut location has something diff that's specifically  from the  chef at that location. Not all secret menu items are the same at every location so if this cheba hut has something on their signature menu get it because you probably will NOT be able to get it at any other cheba hut. 

All their sandwiches have meat or Multiple types of meats on them that's why it is so cool they have about 3-4 diff veggie sandwiches  they also have salads and sides. Their pretzel bites are pretty bitchin so I'd give those a try if I were you!

Overall the place is very clean well organized and easy to find. 
Parking can kinda be a bitch sometimes but well worth it. Located behind the seven eleven on Sahara and rainbow.
Check this place out the sandwiches are def diff than most sandwich places"}
{"text":"Cheba Hut.. I forgot how much I missed you. \"Home of the Blunts\" you are.. and I love it. A toasted sub places dedicated to the reefer, you may think of this joint as more of gimmick than anything, but I tell you that this is legit. 

I always end up with the Midwest Best - never lets me down. You gotta check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great experience all over. Food was delicious and the staff was more than happy to help, even when my friend spilled a cup of water."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted me to try her favorite sandwich and picked up The Kali Mist for me on her way home.  It ended up being pretty good.  All ingredients were fresh and I love when a turkey sandwich has a lot of flavor, which it did.  My only complaint would be that it was drenched in mayo.  I could've done without that but overall, a pretty good sandwich.  I checked out their menu and it looks like they have quite a few yummy options.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! Great local business -- now wth FIVE Arizona locations and California, Colorado, and more!"}
{"text":"This is the place we heard the most about when we first moved here, everyone was telling us to go and giving us sandwich recommendations. Needless to say, we went in with high expectations. And they did not disappoint. I ended up trying the Skywalker and it was as delicious as I expected. I want to say I will try another sandwich next time I go, but I'm not so sure. Haha."}
{"text":"One of the best food places around town. Great college type feel and many other people visit. Try the white widow!"}
{"text":"Good place for lunch and dinner. If you are a member of 5 star then you get additional discounts like free nug/Pinner. Me and my wife go here almost once a week. The most famous sandwich is the White widow. I would suggest this place strongly. Temple is average but Chandler is better. Go on and try it. You will love it I am sure. You will also get something in your birthday. So why miss it. Can't give it higher than 4 starts because of the ambience. A little on the dull side but students would love it."}
{"text":"Can't get order straight and took me 30 minutes to finally give up and ask for my $$ back. I left hungry and a bit annoyed. A regular Greek Salad is not a side salad.  .waited and waited for it to be fixed never was"}

{"text":"I love the Kali mist sandwich on their garlic herb bread! The bread here makes the sandwich so yummy!"}
{"text":"Oh god, everything was a nightmare. I came in with my boyfriend and ordered a Pinner Griefo with no pickles and a small soup to go. When we got home I tasted my soup and almost gagged. It was over cooked, burnt, and tasted like metal. I drove all the way back and told the manager how it tasted. He tried it himself and agreed that it was horrible but said that I was \"exaggerating\", which made me feel uncomfortable. I understand people make mistakes, but serving old soup that tastes like burnt plastic is beyond insulting. The girl working the counter said it sometimes tastes like that when its been cooked too long, and sometimes she smells it and can't believe how gross it is and she isn't sure why they still sell it. So they know they are serving people horrible food yet they continue to do so?

The manager really wasn't a bad guy and kept trying to give me things for free but after tasting that I really wasn't hungry. Finally he agreed to refund me the soup but had to call another manager because he didnt know how. He ended up refunding my boyfriends card and having me pay him cash (for smaller size subs). In the end he wasn't 100 percent sure that he refunded it so I should call back if it doesn't show up on my bank statement. What a mess. 

Got home and opened my sandwich. Had pickles on it. Wont be back."}
{"text":"Everything was great I got a blunt of the kush, it was my first time there and I would recommend them to the next person. The overall experience was simply just fun. The staff are just delightful, Cheba Hut has definitely earned my business."}
{"text":"Ordered the khali mist sandwich and Rice Krispie treat.  Honestly the food was amazing and would definitely order take out from here.  This place felt a bit grungy and dirty would probably not enjoy eating here though.   Otherwise the food alone is a five star."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and it's always been great. Today was the first day there was any kind of a problem. My boyfriend and I had been waiting for a over a half an hour for our food and when I pointed it out it turned out that the machine hadn't printed out our order for the line to make. They apologized beyond profusely and quickly made our order, correct and same great quality as always. When the guy brought our food he continued to apologize and when I told him that it was ok, mistakes happen he thanked me for being so understanding. It wasn't anyone's fault for the mistake and no point in making them feel even worse than they had. They were awesome at correcting the situation and we aren't going to stop coming here! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I consider myself a tough critic. When people tell me to try something new and \"it's the best\", I say to myself, \"yeah right... I'll see about that\". But no, Cheba hut is that good. Granted I *HAVE* had some poor sandwiches here, but jesus christ, nothing touches the afghani. Nothing! I've tried tons of different subs shops, and this is my favorite. 

Staff is always super chill (obviously) and the inside definitely does need to be remodeled, but I can't knock it. It's so good."}
{"text":"This place will always be my favorite. Every location always has the best people working there and the food is amazing every time. So if you like great food, awesome music, and phenomenal service.....you should probably check this place out."}
{"text":"Horrible service... Cashiers act like complete morons. Very frustrating to deal with. They throw off the vibe of this location. Employees can't get the order right and they ruined the Tempe location. Mesa location is soooooo much better.
MESA LOCATION
*better customer service
*entertaining to be around 
*entertaining surrounding
*Mesa gets the order right the first time and every time"}
{"text":"I generally love this establishment and would give it five stars if not for the spotty service. This is not to say that the people are bad, sometimes they have been the BEST, I have had the most helpful and suggestive individuals. I have also been in when the employees are relatively useless and are ad high as the stores branding insinuates that they might be. 
The subs are so on point and worth the slightly longer wait (and similar price point) as Jimmy Johns. They are mostly toasted and wayyyyyyy full of flavor, also far more options. 
The desert options are not something to pass up. 
Overall, this is golden for drunk food and when you are looking for a good lunch or diner. Always good, I've been many times in all of the above conditions. 
Do not forget... Everyday happy hour is 4:20-6:20. This is all beers on tap for two dolla. It's a great way to kickstart the weekend on a Thursday or Friday! Also the beers are far above average beers for happy hours, like New Glarus and Karbon four type of local stuff."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are good. They don't pay their employees appropriately and have the tip menu come up at the register and feel obligated to tip. It's not like you have to tip at mc D or subway, / chipotle and it's the exact same system. This isn't a restaurant where people come back and forth to a table and earn tips."}
{"text":"Fun place! I now feel educated in terms of all things related to weed, and the food was good too! Great music, cool vibe, happening place! Will be back!"}
{"text":"It's tha bomb! Great sandwhiches and reasonably priced! I love the theme and decor of the place which is obvious! But the this is my sandwhich shop whenever I'm in Phoenix! You can never go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Place is dirty,  most if not all of the tables need to be wiped down.  Had to sit at a dirty table.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"Ok so I don't usually give out 5 stars but DAMN!!! I love love love this place the sandwiches are seriously amazing. My friend Josh asked if I had ever been to it sadly no! Man was I missing out! Had a nugg size sandwich and it was the perfect size yummy next time I'm at his house I will be there:) 
Not gonna lie totally love the theme and feel of the place reminds me of the coffee/breakfast place by my house in tahoe love it all so felt at home here and that means the most to me!"}
{"text":"This place has a cool interior and has great food.  I recommend their \"Kali Mist.\"  Prices are normal for a sub/sandwich restaurant ... They have cereal bars at the front counter that are really good too! I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Yes, it is probably as good as it gets for a SANDWICH place. Very tasty. All 3 of us liked our different sandwiches. I also ordered pasta salad but it really was not any good, but it does not matter as i did not come there for a pasta salad. Real good besides that."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a craft brew and toasted sub in Las Vegas. With the unique sandwiches and \"munchie\" options one can feel overwhelmed by the many different choices however anything on this menu will leave a true stoner satisfied. I chose to order a blunt (12\") of the Panama red which is their version of a \"chicken parm\". The perfect toasted garlic and herb bread complimented the tender moist chicken and to tie everything together...the perfect marinara. Kool aid on tap is a different and fun way that transports you back to your childhood I would 10/10 recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Great subs with real toppings sent through a regular oven. Takes a little time, but totally worth it. Visit this location usually once a week and never disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a great, laid back find in Mesa. I had the best sandwich of my life! The theme is controversial, but done well. In addition to sandwiches, they do have salads and even kool-aid. Definitely an unique place!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich place you can find! So happy they opened one here in Vegas after going to their locations in Denver so many times. Great vibe, delicious menu, cool staff. Everyone must try Cheba Hut."}
{"text":"Love this place. Have never had a sandwich I didn't like. When I was pregnant I craved their Humboldt sandwich. So good! Ate there at least once a week. Everyone is very nice too."}
{"text":"I saw health violations. The lady wearing a half shirt rubbing her bare belly against the sandwich prep area was gross. Even my teenage son was put off with that. I think I saw a man serve some dudes sandwiches. He walked them out, then passed by the end of the drink area, near the kool aid dispensers,  pushed the trash down in the garbage can with his bare hands, then, he continued to behind the counter, handling goods. No hand washing seen. GROSS.  The sandwiches were ok. Certainly not 5* caliber. I've had much better for less pricey. I really like the chipotle mayo. But this experience was not the best."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sub shop downtown. If you want good subs and good drinks this is the place. Customer service is always on point there. There is a awesome drink there called the hash can everyone should try it."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Always get the 5-0 blunt loaded, garlic bread. Great food. Fair price. Excellent ambiance.  Also hit the other ones in PHX and also El Cajon, CA and they are all good."}
{"text":"Love the midwest best sammie on garlic bread. I wish they had more drink options, but other than that I love the taste."}
{"text":"Holy shit. This place is fantastic. The atmosphere leaves something to be desired since I'm not a hippy or a pothead however the food and staff are amazing. Everyone's always super friendly and the griefo sub is so good! Who knew I would like a sub without meat. No I will not be turning vegan, and the closest I come to eating raw is unbaked cookie dough. No seriously, I'm not a pothead. Also delicious are the little treats you buy near the front register. Homemade rice crispy squares, things made with peanutbutter. Dude, I love you man! Oh, only complaint is the rest room. Do not use it. Or any restroom on that city block. Trust."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The marijuana theme isn't kid-friendly though, so DONT bring your kids. Just bring it home to them.

Their subs are really tasty, the theme (for adults) is hilarious, the people are friendly, and are reasonably priced.

Also, the potato salad is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Damn stoners forgot to make my food!!! How could you do this to me Cheba Hut?? I've loved you for 9 years! I understand the argument of not being allowed to watch the flatscreen TV during work hours is an important one, but being that apparently talking to each other is too big of a distraction to not miss orders, I'm gonna have to side with management on this one.

Aside from the literal temper tantrum I witnessed by the majority of the staff with regard to the aforementioned TV, screaming obscenities and all, everything else was pretty crappy too. I got a salad for the first time ever at Cheba Hut, specifically the Southwestern Chicken Salad, and boy oh boy was that a mistake!! After waiting 20+ minutes for my shitty salad, I am handed a bowl full of brown-edged lettuce with mayonnaise-based chicken salad looking suspiciously like it came out of a can scooped on top.  Nowhere did I see the spicy marinated chicken breast, salsa, and other southwestern accoutrement I was promised by the description.

The manager/owner/person of authority came out at the last second to earn this second star by giving me a free rice krispie treat for my troubles, which was freakin' delicious.

This broke my heart Cheba Hut, as I pretty much survived only on your Dank Nugs and Kind Pinners through college, but you did me wrong today. 

Get your shit together, get some fresh (preferably local) vegetables, and get the whiny, pre-pubescent boys out from behind the counter and I'll consider coming back.

Until then, thanks to the god awful salad and non-service, you guys are cashed."}
{"text":"Cheba Hut did not disappoint. I've never had a mistake made on my order and the food has always been delicious, no matter the location. I haven't been to one in a while, but I was extremely pleased with my experience. We came in on a Saturday night, around 10PM. The young man at the register greeted us as soon as we walked in. He also confirmed how I wanted my sandwich and if pickles were okay, which was thoughtful of him to do. He also comped my drink and a brownie that we had decided to purchase after my total was rung up.

The ambiance was fun, there was good music playing, but it wasn't too loud. Three or four other groups of customers already eating were all having a good time. The food seemed to take a little longer than expected, but was great. My boyfriend and I both got White Widow pinners, with which we were very pleased. Their Yerba Mate iced tea was also yummy. The prices were reasonable and I will definitely be returning, especially to this location!"}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best sandwiches you'll ever have. I've tried almost everything on their menu and have never been disappointed (even with their vegetarian sandwich!) Try the White Widow with BBQ sauce and pickles. And the snacks are awesome! 

A bit pricey for a sandwich shop but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are delicious, if a bit spendy, but they are large and filling. 

The marijuana theme is hilarious :-) but maybe not kid friendly.

Its a college joint, and right next to ASU so whatever.

I would definitely eat here again if I was in the mood for a sandwich (admittedly not often)."}
{"text":"FIrst and last time ordering for delivery. As I type this, I'm still waiting for my food to be delivered - about a hour late. Maybe they don't realize there are PLENTY of sandwich places in Tempe. I won't make this mistake again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sandwich shops.  I have a standing Friday lunch with a coworker and we come here 80% of the time.  I get the same thing every time.  Call me boring, but it is the perfect sandwich.  The Kali Mist is turkey topped with pepperjack cheese, bacon, avocado, diced jalapeños, and chipotle dressing on white bread.  I don't know where they get their bread for certain, but I think it is a magical land of crispy, chewy delightfulness.  They offer other toppings, but who needs vegetables?  Cheba recently added a bar with beer on tap and offer an all day HH on Fridays.  Delivery is available through a phone app, but it takes an hour to get your food.  While still delicious when delivered, it is much better eaten fresh in the restaurant itself.  The stoner theme is the best and they always have a movie on so you can watch as you eat (you won't want to talk once you start eating these sandwiches)."}
{"text":"I kept hearing about this place from my buddy's GF and so we decided on a day trip to check this place out...

Being from Atlanta, it was nice to walk into a place all things reefer and not feel too completely weirded out by it (it's not like we are in Amsterdam, were still stateside!).  

The place is kind of narrow- the food prep on the left, seating on the right.  The counter has a huge menu posted, which I would suggest doing some research beforehand- or else you will have a stupified face (like myself) when its time to order.  I told them I was from Atl, and they were most accomodating.  They also have some nice baked goods at the counter too (I snagged a rice krispy for a snack).

I didn't live too dangerously- I got the Hawaiian sub and kept it just meat, cheese, and pineapple.  The lady making the sandwich insisted it was too boring so I told her to throw a suprise ingredient in there- I am pretty sure it was oregano ;).  

The bread was great, and the flavors were good as well.  There was a drink machine that had Hawaiian Punch too but I forgot it it was pepsi or coke products (i was in a haze... oops).

If reefer culture doesn't offend (it's not like you are walking into Bob Marley's living room and getting a contact high) you and you want a filling toasted sub, then this place is worth a shot!

Now if they can only open one up on the East Coast :)"}
{"text":"Checked Yelp for eats in the neighborhood, Cheba Hut came up with good ratings.
Mellow atmoshere, funky weed smoking theme but I'm open minded as long as people are cool.
I had the Jamaican Chicken Red (spicy) on wheat bread.  Pleasantly surprised at the amazing flavors this has, it was a rollercoaster of many tastes. Spicy, juicy chicken and the olives, pickles, tomato and lettuce seasoned with olive oil vinegar dressing was balance perfectly.
It was worth the stop."}
{"text":"Allow me please to Yelp about a lost gem of the sandwich world, Cheba Hut. I use to have the pleasure of eating one of there amazing toasted sandwiches on a regular basis back when I was a young pup attending ASU, but have since moved away from the Tempe area. I found myself in the area today luckily enough and decided to treat myself to my long lost place. My order?...The grilled Chicken Teriyaki sandwich with all the trimmings, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onions, sauce, cheese and pineapple. Just as delicious as I remembered it being. And really how often do you get the opportunity to eat underneath the world's largest blunt replica, and pictures of Cheech eating the same sandwich as you in the exact seat you are sitting in. Only at Cheba Hut, where you get the reggae mixed with Harold and Kumar laid back vibe. Definitely make a visit."}
{"text":"I started my review a year or so ago and never completed it. I will now. Before wasn't to happy with the service or the wait. But was happy with the food. So now that I have been back over a year later everything has improved. It is worth the trip to have a really good sandwich.  I like how the staff works on taking care of the customer before and after the order. This makes a big difference when you choose to get out of the work environment . 

Now onto the food. There are so many different sandwiches to choose from. From all veggie to straight meat. Depending on what you are in the mood for you will not be disappointed. I really like the variety of flavor they offer. One of my favs is the Appollo 13. It's like a Greek chicken salad on a sub type of bread. You can choose 3 different sizes depending on your hunger. I don't know Where they get their bread or if they make it... but it's really good. Cheba hut also sells salads and other sides and appetizers. I will also add that the serve cookies and brownies but their goo balls are the bomb. 
If you never been here. I recommend giving it a try. Oh they have kool aid."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are super tasty. Very clean food and meticulously put together. The prices are great and the sandwiches are very satisfying. We love the peanut butter hemp brownies for dessert. After having a full sandwich you many not be able to squeeze on a brownie, but even if you save it for later, it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"they're good sandwiches. not the sort you see everywhere else, slightly on the healthier side, made with pride by folks who always seem to be in a prrretty good mood....for WHATEVER reasons. their food seems slightly overpriced to me, but it's worth it sometimes to get that CHEBA experience.  and THAT is why i was so sad to hear that they would soon be serving ALCOHOL,,,TERRIBLE IDEA!  i believe this idea sucks so seriously that i could go on for some time about it (and several people i've spoken to fully agree).  but here are a few key reasons why it's a lousy idea; 1. the cheba atmosphere will NOT mix well with drunk/drinking patrons. 2. there is alcohol available virtually anywhere in that whole neighborhood (entirely not a novel item). 3. it will be open too late (for stoners) now. people will think it's uncool. an alcohol environment will bring AALLLL sorts of unwanted elements to this true staple of the tempe area. i have been a fan since 2002, and wish they would reconsider this ill-conceived scheme. how about some coffee, some tea, some other kind of healthier ...mellower beverages?? now that would be nice. if you agree, let them know that Tempe doesn't need ANOTHER BAR!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwiches, the area is sketch but once inside it's cool.
Worth a trip if you want a different assortment of sandwich, just probably plan on making sure the trip is during the daytime :)"}
{"text":"by far my favorite sandwich place in the phoenix area! great food and an awesome vibe! love that you can get beer too. anytime i have out of town visitors i make an effort to take them here! i'm getting hungry just typing about this place!"}
{"text":"Great. Unreal subs and atmosphere. Toasted subs for toasted people. Great spot to grab a beer or get some food."}
{"text":"When you order from a stoner-themed sandwich shop, it's best to prepare for the unexpected every once in a while. 

I get takeout here about once a week and call in my order because I have zero patience for waiting. My order is perfect about 80% of the time. The other 20% of the time, there's something missing or something added. Sometimes they have a hard time understanding that when I say I want to add lettuce, tomato, and onion, I do NOT mean I want it \"fully loaded\" (a menu option that includes lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and house dressing). The guy I talked to on the phone last night also had no idea what I was saying when I said I wanted giardinara on my sandwich. On their menu, it says \"Try it with horseradish & giardinara peppers\" underneath the sandwich I ordered. He must have been new though, and I'll cut him some slack.

I also hate that my name is in their system as \"Jennerfer\" (ermahgerd!), which I take to be a result of 1) being stoned, 2) poor spelling skills (come on, Jennifer is a pretty common name, or 3) all of the above.

That said, I keep coming back because they have interesting sandwich toppings and they're pretty delicious overall. I recommend the White Widow and the KGB (with horseradish & giardinara peppers). Always on garlic herb bread."}
{"text":"Wooow had the \"Jamaican Red\" sandwich, was pretty juicy and tasty :))) Will be back, Staff was nice and service was great. 
Also had a fruity pebbles dessert it was okay."}
{"text":"They have never gotten my order right. I actually enjoy the subs a lot so I have gone back multiple times, but i will never again now that this is the 5th time they have given me a very wrong sub."}
{"text":"Love this location. Love Cheba hit. Love their white widow nugs and anyplace that uses word play on the menu and has pictures of ice cube on the ice cubes lol"}
{"text":"Favorite sub place hands down. The ambiance is unparalleled. The subs are
Gourmet for sure. This isn't subway with tasteless veggies and sauces.  Everything here is SO flavorful and they have three 4 locations in AZ I believe. I've been to all except the flagstaff one is next."}
{"text":"I give 2 out if 5 stars as opposed to 5 stars for the Flagstaff location and 4 stars for the tempe, mesa and Tucson locations. I brought my sandwich back to the counter because I was a huge idiot asshole who forgot to mention it to them before I got the sammich. I was direct and polite, but I got a snarky big dick with a beard and snake bites (which I have nothing against) in my face who made a comment along the lines of waiting on me hand and foot. Maybe I should have taken my tip back. As a former employee of Chëba Hut in Flagstaff, this style of \"customer service\" would get us fired in less than a heartbeat. Not sure what kind of vibe this place is trying to put out. In addition, my white widow was luke warm at best."}
{"text":"My god. Do not get the salad. Im actually quite shocked at the sheer meagerness of this salad. 8+ dollars for a dressed up side salad is rediculous. I honestly thought it was a cruel joke until one of the reps reassures me that this tablespoon of salad with pepperonis on too was in fact the whole thing. 

Sandwich was great. The salads are a complete joke. Im actually kind of insulted by it. Had to go home and make another dinner to eat with this morsel as a side item."}
{"text":"I absolutely dig this place! The people are super friendly and they have amazing sandwiches!! My favorite is the sticky icky mmmm it's bomb! They also have Kool Aid on tap!! It's clean inexpensive you can't go wrong! Don't forget to check them out on 4/20!!!!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Cheeba Hut? The white widow is my absolute favorite, on the garlic bread of course! The munchies are a can't miss and the cool aid variety is one of a kind. Expect a line after 11:45 weekdays but it is worth the wait. They have added a bar and offer some great booze and lunch bundle deals. Staff is friendly and restrooms are clean."}
{"text":"There are certain truths in life that are simply infallible. One of those truths is: trust stoners to make your food. No one has doe-eyed love for consumptive gluttony like someone so stoned they can barely think. You want the proprietor of your chow to have such little outside awareness that your dumb meal becomes their world.

For that matter, there is a cynical sheen to the whole marketing effort of Cheba Hut. A pot-themed sandwich joint smack in the middle of the college shopping experience seems a little too cutesy to me. I am, of course, a frowny joyless grandpa though. So don't read too much into my grousing about the marketing. Down to brass tacks.

The food. Man, the food. All ingredients I've experienced (\"experienced,\" you guys) have been very fresh and tasty. Plenty of great combos from standard hams and turkeys to more exotic like Thai chicken. Lots of sauce choices and dessert options too. Everything has a ridiculous/amusing name, so do some reading to figure out what is actually on the stupid thing.

Cheba Hut is like when your weird 14-year-old brother keeps bugging you about checking out his likely awful garage band. Just bad covers of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Weezer, you think as you step into the garage. And you know what? The band is pretty good. They're all dressed unfortunately and the whole affair is kinda sloppy but the band is pretty damn good. That's Cheba Hut.

Get a sandwich from people who think that life is just an unending Scooby Doo cartoon. Do it."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. Everyone was super nice and the sandwich was ready super fast. The sandwich was actually really good and the pretzel nugs were delicious as well. The only reason they do not get 4 or 5 stars is because I instantly had the liquid after. It might have been the butter in the nugs, or the tuna. I will never know. I had to hustle it to Walmart, buy some wipes and hit the john. I probably won't be back. Again the employees were so nice!!"}
{"text":"Full bar, Friendly staff, Best Subs, Outdoor Patio, Beach Party, Comedy Show, Open Late, Cool Vibes, Great Location, and A Nice crowd. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"The theme and atmosphere is unique to say the least but the sandwiches and their rice crispy treats are delicious. I loved the grape ape sandwich which I think was a limited time thing. But they all are really good"}
{"text":"My favorite place for a sandwich in town. The quality of the ingredients surpass other local establishments. All three of the people working there kept offering me additional toppings. The service was beyond lovely. I felt like they were my friends, even if they were only bonded to me by our mutual liking of sandwiches."}
{"text":"This was another place I wanted to love, but the pace of the service is just what you would expect from a place that has a clock permanently set to 4:20. 

We stopped to get a couple quick take out sandwiches. The guy taking the order was super cool and made a good first impression. 

Once the order was placed, he bagged up another delivery order, delivered it, and came back before they were done making our first sandwich. 

It was every bit of 30 minutes. And, most annoying, they didn't even act like they were busy! One guy fumbled with a salad lid for like 10 minutes...bewildered as if he had never seen one before! I wanted to snatch it out of his hand and show him that he was obviously trying to put it on upside down! He even grabbed another as if a new one would somehow go on upside down. He wrapped the salad and side of dressing in plastic to prevent leaks. Nice thought but also VERY time consuming. 

The other sandwich girl wasn't taking a hint either. The guy in front of me told her he was hung over, didn't care what was on the sandwich, didn't want to answer questions and asked her to just make the sandwich they way she wanted (in other words, hurry the F up!). She continued to ask him the questions anyway...

Sandwiches were pretty good, but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Nestled just a short walk away from The Source dispensary is this wonder of a sandwich shop. The theme is quite abundant throughout and the location is super fitting. 

I recently stopped in for a to go order, walking in the place just smells amazing. There's a counter for ordering, a side bar and plenty of seating. I decided to go with the Humbolt sub this time which was toasted deliciousness topped with veggies, guac, spouts, and a special sauce. I love how they had multiple vegetarian options and of course meat options aka something for everyone.

The sub was great, I'll definitely be back again to try more.  The medium size was just right too, didn't leave me hungry or too stuffed."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB! I am glad we found this new sub place. It is so refreshing to find a great place amazing selection of sub sandwiches that are tasty."}
{"text":"This place is a complete stoner place... which, as a teacher, makes it tough for me to be in there... but the sandwiches are so dang good, it's impossible to stay away! AMAZING sandwiches!!!"}
{"text":"Stoners really make amazing food. The BEST sandwiches I have ever had. I can eat a footlong and a half at subway but here i can't eat much more than a nug, the 4 inch. The atmosphere is cool whether you are a pot-head or not, and it goes without saying that the employees are always very friendly. The food is always fresh and delicious, my favorite sanwich is the Thai stick and an egg salad one that i forgot the name of. But don't forget desert. The fruit rice krispies and normal rice krispies are delicious, and so are the gooey balls."}
{"text":"This place is just amazing! The menu is entertaining and, please, if u go there... U MUST try the sweet munchies they offer! The staff is great, they made me feel like family!!!"}
{"text":"I love the staff I love the food the atmosphere is cool but for some reason your sub is never right why do they mess up so much. Every time I order my sub is wrong either I order there either I order online or either I order for delivery it is always wrong like I said I love the staff they're always very nice but what is up. I asked for extra Chipotle mayo didn't get it I mean I also ask for no house dressing and they put it on the sub I mean come on guys the same rocket science. I think most of the good posts on here are employees and or fake posts not an allegation just a thought wow! If anyone else agrees with me please like my comment or send me a message cuz I think I'm right the food's good and the people are good but what the fuck is going on"}
{"text":"Best subs that I've ever eaten--from anywhere, and of all time. This place is unbelievably and  rockingly delicious. Immediate deliveries too if you're lazy AF like I am."}
{"text":"I love this place.

Great food. Good vibe. Good music.

Well. All I ever order is the la canna. But other people I have been with enjoyed their food too.

I don't know what the rest of the chain looks like. But the mother ship is a fun trip."}
{"text":"Can't say that I've ever tried the food bcuz they've never actually shown up.  I'm new to the area and heArd this place was bomb so I gave it a cpl shots...but it was a waste of my time since the food never came.  If you want to try the food, forget delivery.  Get it together mr cheba"}
{"text":"Heyyy mannn, if you usually talk like how I'm writin' right now, and you, like, wanna spend your time hangin' out and don't mind waitin'... and waitin... for your sammich, this is the place to be dudes. 

Anyhoo, it took me 20 minutes for my sandwich to be made!  The bread is nicely toasted, the ingredients and sauce are plentiful, but the Thai jerk sandwich tasted a bit strange to me (probably related to the sauce), and was not worth the really long wait for lunch."}
{"text":"We just placed an order for delivery over the phone and it was the best experience I've had in a long time. Sierra has stellar customer service!! I've worked in the industry for years now and genuine service like Sierra's is hard to find. The food here is always awesome, were never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best subs in the valley, period.  Friendly staff, consistent quality, and I love 'em toasted! (the sandwich, not the employee)  I order ahead and pick-up most of the time and the orders have always been right."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I forgot about this hole in the wall that was my weekly lunch getaway when I worked down the street.  Since March, they've expanded their space which is awesome.  Now I feel comfy sitting down to enjoy my sammie without someone breathing on me.  

They are vegetarian friendly, I love the griefo that has their hemp cream cheese and then I have them add hummus.  Put some guacamole on that sucker and I've eaten the perfect veggie sandwich.  I'm definitely going to make it back here when I'm slumming it in Tempe next."}
{"text":"Interesting menu. Great service. A little more expensive than other sandwich places but the menu is worth it. No WiFi. Like the music they play in the restaurant. Worth checking out for sure if you are close by."}
{"text":"Since 2004, I have been ordering the same thing from Cheba Hut - \"Nug\" (4inch) Griefo on Garlic/Herb with all the greens/veg they have but mushrooms and cucumbers! Extra pickle please! Always the same. Never changing. No, I will not try another sandwich. I'm addicted to the Griefo, thank you very much. My name is Jill, and I'm a Cheba Hut Griefo addict. 

(HI JILL!) 

While sometimes the service can be somewhat slow, the product they produce is IMO, fantastic! Quality takes time. Even more time if a pothead is behind the counter making your sandwich. ;)"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are always good quality and the place has a unique atmosphere. Would not recommend delivery because it usually takes over an hour. It's better just to call or order online and pick up. Go for the food not so much the service."}
{"text":"Popped in for a roast beef since that is spotty in FL. Low key staff, attentive and you can grab a beer while waiting. Food is fresh, quick and most important, tastes great. Sound like a Frosted Flakes commercial."}
{"text":"Whether you're 420 friendly or slightly on the immature side, or just like themed restaurants, this is definitely a sandwich shop to stop by and try.  The food definitely makes up for the divey pot themed interior and lack of service, beside the friendly cashiers. I'd recommend bringing your own drink because their selection is mediocre, unless you're okay with bad fountain drinks or the stoner favorite Kool Aid, all in all try my personal favorite Kali Mist and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cheba hut is a franchise that has been pretty successful in other states. This is their first restaurant in Las Vegas and their concept still remains the same. Their menu and decor make reference to weed terms and concepts. None of their food has weed, they just try to recreate a fun a laid back atmosphere. Their menu is pretty unique and extensive. They have several options and they are also flexible by letting you create a customized sandwich. 

The taste of their sandwiches are great. I am personally a fan of the garlic bread which was perfectly toasted and crunchy. Their atmosphere is fun and entertaining. This particular location also has a bar with happy hour deals! Great sandwiches and beer seem like a perfect combination!"}
{"text":"Only been here one time and that was several months ago, but man it was amazing.  Really great friendly people working here.  Awesome fresh food and the brownies are killer!"}
{"text":"Pinner and pint Tuesdays! What? 
I didn't even get my sandwich yet and I know it'll taste better with my $2 lagunitas pint.  
Life is good but seems better with a lunch time beer on a workday.  
Sandwich is awesome."}
{"text":"Great food!  I have been coming here since I was a little kid.  I like the Jamaican Red blunt.  Fun atmosphere and laid back people.  Gotta love it."}
{"text":"I ordered online for a delivery. The delivery time said 6:30 or so around there. By that time I called and was told by the person who answered that no order was under my address. After telling them the order number I got my sandwiches within 15 minutes. Sandwiches were good but service was okay. 3 stars only because of the quality."}
{"text":"Been going here for, shit, 10 years? I really want to love it (pakalolo no Swiss sub pepper Jack) but lately it's been kinda pissin me off, for all the reasons mentioned by everyone else here.

Great subs, not so much meat on them, kinda pricey, ultra slow, thumbs up for having mtn dew on tap.

Oh, and not green/sustainable at all!! Tried to redeem about 5 punch cards totaling 10 punches for a free sammich but they wouldn't let me. They could have just reused the cards, giving the ones with one punch to the next customers instead of punching and wasting all new cards.

Hippies my ass . . .

I will probably be going back, though not nearly as much."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the theme and the drunk college kids hanging out in the restaurant, this place has solid sandwiches. If you want something cheap take-outy but better than say, Subway (and I LIKE subway!), Cheba Hut is a good choice. Just make sure you're comfortable ordering a \"blunt\", etc, because the menu items are all pot themed..

I'm not a vegetarian but the Griefo, one of the meatless choices on the menu, is always very satisfying. My favorite part is the jalapeño cream cheese! You should add it to whatever sandwich you end up getting :)

Never ordered delivery but they do have a pretty snazzy delivery mobile."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this location today for lunch.  I wasn't sure what to expect based on the name and how it looks when you walk through the door.  I ordered the white widow sub and it was SO good.  Probably one of the best subs I've had so far.  I usually get veggie subs but this one sounded good so I figure I'd try it and it didn't disappoint.  The sub has chicken smothered in ranch on it along with melted provolone cheese, mushrooms, and bacon.  Definitely something to get again when we go back to this location."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and years, always a great toasted sub. Jamacian Red is where its at...Boom spicy and tasty.  Good to see they expanded"}
{"text":"Cheba Hut is one of those beloved institutions in a college town, full of low cost and delicious items, perfect for developing those classic college memories or in my case, trying to remember what it was like to be in college. I'm primarily a fan of the veggie hummus sandwich, the silver haze, but the white widow, with chicken, bacon and ranch dressing, is also quite good, though somewhat heavier.

A few years ago this location was quite a bit smaller but the owners bought the store location next door, kicked out the wall, and created a much bigger eating space, as well as putting in a bar at the back which provides eaters, stoned or not stoned, with a variety of delicious beers, several of them locally brewed.

At one time you ordered your sandwich and then waited for your name to be called and walked up to the happy hippy group where the sandwiches came out of the toaster oven, to choose your toppings and experience some cheerful hippy vibe. However, last time I went in, they killed the back end process, with everything being ordered up front. I have to say, NOT a fan of that change, it makes Cheba seem overly corporate and chain like and misses exposing customers to that classic hippy culture with that back end discussion with the sandwich makers so owners of Cheba Hut, if you are listening, stop trying to be so process driven, the inefficiency of the sandwich making, with the two step process, is a key part of your culture, it is what makes Cheba Hut, Cheba Hut, so bring it back! Think of it as a form of relationship marketing, maybe not as fast as one order and done but it was one of my favorite parts of coming to this most lovely of sandwich places."}
{"text":"I love this place. Far better than Subway or Quiznos. While they have a set menu with more than 20 subs you are welcome to build your own as well. They offer 3 sizes of subs (nug 4\", pinned 8\" and  blunt 12\") on white, wheat or garlic \"herb\" bread. All subs are served with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, pickles and their special sauce. They also serve salads and have a variety of desserts.  They offer several vegetarian options, my personal fave is the majic mushroom with teriyaki marinated portabella mushrooms with green bell peppers, pineapple and pepperjack cheese. I always add honeymustard which was recommended by the cashier on our first visit. In the mood for some meat?  The Dank (a pizza sub) or The Kind (Turkey, swiss, bacon and mushriom) are great too!  And guess what!? They serve Kool-Aid. Ohhhhh Yeeaaahhh!"}
{"text":"Came here by accident and so glad I did. The subs are amazing. Like the relaxed vibe the place has. Cheap drinks too. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"My friend raved about Cheba Hut the other night and as I was starving on my way home from work a few days ago, I decided to swing by since it's on the way. They have a vast menu and after looking at it for a few minutes, I decided on Midwest's Best. I placed my order and waited a few minutes for my sammy. There were a few other people in the place and the staff seemed pretty chill. After a while they called my name and I realized that you customize it after it comes out of the toaster, so I went back and got my fixins. Once I got home I dug in. I have to say that unless something is wicked unique about you're sub place, most sandwiches really taste the same. I normally don't like toasted subs but I liked this better than Quizno's, but for the price and overall experience, I can't say it's better than any other sub place."}
{"text":"We love this place! Cheba Hut has BEST sandwiches and staff are always very nice and friendly. Some people may avoid it due to the name or theme/atmosphere but the food is great and totally worth it, even if it you're not feelin the vibe."}
{"text":"I will never ever go to Quiznos or Subway ever again!  Cheba Hut is definitely the best and most creative sub shop around.
I had the White Widow sandwich on a garlic herb bun.  It came with chicken smothered in ranch, cheese, bacon,  and mushrooms.  I also added peppers and mustard and it was completely awesome.  
Looking at the menu, I realize that really whatever I am in the mood for, they have.  I would give it -1 star for not having green chilies, but I will survive (and so will be esophogus)

Prices are very reasonable and I loved it that I had the choice of an 8\" sub.  My biggest issue with the likes of Subway is that I could only get 6 or 12\" when all I wanted was something in the middle.

I found a new love in Cheba Hut.  YUMMY!!!! And the decor ROCKS!!!!!"}
{"text":"It seems like for the past few years I have always been hearing about Cheba Hut.  Wherever I was at very random times it seemed to come up in conversation often.  Why is that?  Well, the answer to that is quite simple, the name of the sandwiches and the decor of the restaurant.

The first thing that I was personally wondering was if the food would live up to the hype this restaurant is receiving around town.  When I first walked in the place reminded me of a hole in the wall sandwich joint (no pun intended).  The decor is not fancy or uniform, some things look quite old, and there is weed pictures and icons everywhere.  I scoured the placed looking to find something that was not already in a photo on Yelp with no luck, so check out the photos and you will have a good idea if you want to bring your kid in this place.  

On to the food-yes it's good!  Very good!  It's not that quick so don't go here if you are in a rush but its great food!  I also had the cookie and it was super awesome!  I love sandwiches that look really fresh and these match that criteria perfectly! I will be back!

Return factor 100%"}
{"text":"Since moving to Tempe, I've struggled to find a favorite sandwich place now that I don't have Togo's. Cheba Hut may just be the shop to take it's place.

If you've never been, be warned that it definitely embraces the Stoner Sandwich identity; you'll find that everything in the shop references weed. Some people might be turned off by that (I'm thinking this place probably isn't the number 1 sandwich shop for moms), but that's not what Cheba Hut is about. There mission is to feed starving college students, and they do it exceptionally well. 

There are too many sandwich options to try, and that's definitely not a bad thing. They are a little more expensive than your typical Subway sandwiches, but they definitely come packed; an 8-inch usually fills me up. 

Why the 5 stars? Cheba Hut has great food and Kool Aid in their drink machines. Enough said."}
{"text":"Staff at the register was slammed but super nice and accommodating. Our cashier made it a point to apologize for the wait which he didn't have to do, but was very kind. He was efficient on the menu, answered any questions we had on our orders, and made it a point to give an accurate time estimate for when our order would be ready. Definitely coming back between the service and great food."}
{"text":"I thought it was good. I had the Loaded Not chos! They were tasty! Service was great. Great atmosphere! I'll be back to try different sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Very tasty subs!
I found out about Cheba Hut on MSNBC, and I was in Phoenix to DJ so i made this my first stop!
I wore my Cannabis Cup tshirt that I got from the 2009 Cup in Amsterdam, and I was instantly a friend of the place!

They had Simpsons playing on their TV's! :) 
+1 star for that!

It does take a bit longer than Subway, etc, but you can taste the love!
Will definitely eat at Cheba Hut again!
There are a few locations, mostly in the Southwest US."}
{"text":"I have never had a better sandwich.... Holy crow they are good! Whether you are a business professional or have the munchies, this place hits the spot. I order ache a for my team's lunches allllllllll the time because we are addicted!!! The garlic bread is the best and the spicy chipotle sauce is the boss... I must say.... I have seen the Northern Lights and am a chronic patron!"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches that I've had in my life. The White Widow was tasty, but I'm not a mayo fan. I fell in love with the Kali Mist, and I had to have another the next day! They have a bar, chill music, and ESPN. The staff if very friendly!"}
{"text":"This place isn't for children unless you like your kids to come and see all the 420 stuff then leave them home! Service is fast and excellent, the food is amazing! All the sandwiches are named off of different kinds of weeds. The koolaid machines are my all time favorite! I recommend this place to anyone who's a stoner and 420 friendly."}
{"text":"The dopest dope...pun intended!! White widow is the best sandwich hands down in my opinion!! Go fully loaded don't hesitate just do it!"}
{"text":"Bruh, this place is dope. Friendly clean place w delicious food. And they have koolaid drinks to top it off. Had their cinnamon toast crunch and Cocoa Puffs munchie, good for the soul."}
{"text":"The theme is not for everyone , but get past that or enjoy it . and thenfood is actually pretty damn high quality . I almost think the theme of the place kinda distracts from how good the food is. You just think oh stoner food whatever , and it is actually a damn good sandwich . nice crispy bread , plenty of meat , melty cheese, lots of topping options very customizable . lots of drink options some now with full bars. This place does a sandwich right. Price wise some where between a sit down restaurant and sub way. But quality wise is better then most places around. They have been slow building something impressive here."}
{"text":"Delicious! The chipotle spread was great and the bread was perfectly toasted. Now my fave sub shop to go to!! I live in Scottsdale and will gladly take the drive back! :D"}
{"text":"This place was fiiirreeeee ! I loved the inside , the service and the food ! Something that made me like the place even more is the menu names ! Like pinner , and blunt. Lol I highly recommend this place !!!!!"}
{"text":"I go the this Cheba hut all the time and have had great experiences every time! I always get the kush or the meatball sub and they are always on point!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Always a super upbeat attitude, a welcoming smile, and the sandwiches, munchies, hell-even the koolaid- has never disappointed. Proud repeat customers!"}
{"text":"Excellent subs. Younger atmosphere good friendly service. Music was bitchen! A lot of stuff my band plays, Clash, talking heads, Nirvna"}
{"text":"It's the big doobie that did it for me. I'm easy. A friend that lived here in TempE used to always send me pics of cops eating there under the big joint. I'm not totally into Cheba Hut tho, well the hippy part , sure. But, the food is so-so for the price, especially if you opt to not have alot of extra toppings. The meat/chicken portion seems tiny on that bun. The Acapulco Gold BBQ chicken is pretty tasty, it's the only thing that I get, haha. Worth a try, like Disney."}
{"text":"This place was pretty awesome. As far as the food, it was delicious and solved the problem of my hunger late night. I don't smoke, and am not into that stuff so I wouldn't recommend bringing kids there... but I would absolutely go back. Quick, nice workers, and again my sub was delicious."}
{"text":"Best subs in town. They have more toppings fresh meats and more sauce"}
{"text":"Like the mighty beard of Oden, and more powerful than the hammer of Thor, this place is a powerhouse of supreme deliciousness. Using ingredients fit for a king (or a Kardashian) and the atmosphere of snoop dogs brain, this place will have you leaving high. That's right, High off high quality service and food. I love getting high off food, and if you don't you need to rearrange your priorities. So go to Cheba Hut and get high as F*#@"}
{"text":"Woweee. Kali Mist is now in my top 5 all time favorite sandwiches. Turkey, bacon, avocado, jalapeños, pickles, chipotle mayo, etc... toasted to perfection... so freaking delicious. Plus, they have KOOLAID. I am a huge fan of Koolaid and sincerely wish more restaurants served it because they would have a consistent customer! They also have these rice krispy treats made of all sorts of cereals. The Cinnamon Toast Crunch one is bomb.com. Try this place out! I'm not a fan of the 420 theme, but it's worth enduring for the stellar eats."}
{"text":"Oh dang! This was amazing! I has the G-13 and loved every bite. Super nice staff! I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Awesome late night subs! It was probably one of the most flavorful meats on a Sandwhich I've had, or maybe it was that special dressing they put on it. My new favorite sub shop. Their gooy balls are amazing also"}
{"text":"l prefer this location to the Tempe store, I have no problem hanging out with stoners and Tat freaks eating Goo balls, Tempe felt a bit too preppy trying to act cool for me. Love the 5-0 and white widow."}
{"text":"Eh it's nothing special. What I don't get is how many employees does it take to make two sandwiches when I came in there were 6 people behind the counter one behind the bar and roughly ten people in the joint. It took over 20 minutes to get 2 sandwiches to go and the sandwich was okay at best. The whole stoner vibe is fine except I have seen people under the Influence make a sandwich faster. I will just take my money to Ike's up the street next time its a little more expensive but it tastes better and they can figure out how to put meat in between two pieces of bread."}
{"text":"Super Chill environment with great variety of sandwiches. Love their Kool Aid dispensers"}
{"text":"One of my top-five places to eat in town (I know, I'm a cheap date).  Their toasted subs are fresh, fast and amazingly good.   What is it that makes this place so delicious?  I dunno, it just is.  Mention Cheba Hut to any one who has tasted it before and watch their eyes light up.  It's just that good.

Several premium choices for vegetarians.  My weapon of choice 'The Humbolt' (hold the onions).  Try the thick, fudgy 'hemp' brownies for dessert."}
{"text":"Holy shit, this place is heaven. 

The menu is a great size, the ingredients were fresh and delicious, the desserts were awesome.

Since this is a stoner themed place, the decor and names matched. It felt so cozy and friendly and down to earth there.

I cannot wait to come back here and get another sandwich. If you're a local, you should visit and enjoy - even if you're not a stoner, it is SO worth it."}
{"text":"Toasted subs .. totally worth the long lunch lines!! Really good sandwiches & munchies.. lots of pot /weed references and kool-aid as a fountain drink option! 

The sizes 4\" is the nub, 8\" pinner, 12\" blunt .. bread options white, wheat, garlic herb bread.. choice of chicken, turkey, pork sandwiches.. several veggie options, salads, munchies (desserts & appetizers), and beer.

I try to have something different on each visit.. I've never been disappointed.. on today's visit I had the Kali Mist, 4\" nub size, toasted turkey, bacon, avocado, house dressing, lettuce, tomato, pickle... cool ranch Doritos & blue kool-aid to wash it all down .. 

Grab a Rice Krispie treat or other sweet treat when  you're at the counter .. the line will be long if you decide on dessert after your lunch!! 

You won't be disappointed.. give this place a try."}
{"text":"I admit, I am a sub snob.  Yes, self appointed snob on subs.  I love my subs, and feel that my highly sensitive taste buds shall only be graced with the tastiest, bestest subs on the planet.  I have a long resume of subs under my belt, and know a good sub when I taste it.

Cheba hut isn't bad.  Its just not good.  as good as I wanted them to be.  I had excedingly high expectations for this joint, and was somewhat dissapointed once I sunk my teeth into the sub.  It lacked something...luster maybe, Im not sure, but it just didnt do it for me.

This place is okay.  It has a marijuana themed style thing going for itself.  Not so much hippie, but lots of pot references.  For starters, I dont think that the pot theme is really appropriate for children.  How do you explain this to a child?  Not a family friendly place for anyone of a youthful age (aka small children.)  So, thats a strike.  I  dont think that I would take school age children here just for that.

BUT, the staff was immensly friendly with me.  Service was AMAZING.  The guy at the register was friendly, outgoing, and actually introduced me to the staff.  I felt super relaxed and comfortable when ordering, and eating here.  I love friendly service.  The girl who built my sub was awesome as well.  She made personal conversation with me, and I liked that.

The sub itself lacked meat.  I wanted more meat (stop laughing) and it was short on that.   The food here is okay.  I feel like its more theme then a sub that could light my tastebuds up in flames.

I would probably go here again, but not under the pretense of eating amazing food."}
{"text":"Definitely the best sandwich shop you'll find in Tempe. Every time I go in, I order whatever the cashier's favorite is. I always love what I end up with! In fact, I liked the white widow so much, I named my car after it. The munchies are absolutely freaking AMAZING and who doesn't love koolaid? 

The atmosphere is extra cool too. I don't smoke weed but it's still enjoyable bc it's real chill, lots of art, and the staff are always good to me. They also have a bar in the back with local beers and stuff. 

If you've never been here, you gottttta try it!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came in last night for some subs. Chill vibe, cashier was nice and they're rockin the whole Kool-Aid in bubblers thing, super dope. Management team seems super passionate about their store to. Overall great experience. Between them and ATL, im finding mayself in Glendale ALOT."}
{"text":"I don't like subs. They're normally, too dry, and messy. My drummer took me here after practice and I literally had to eat my words. 
I ordered the KGB without mushrooms. And it was perfect. Right amount of mustered and mayo. All the ingredients were perfect and I found myself \"jonesing\" for another the next day. 

Decor wise it's exactly as I expected and the employees are friendly and welcoming. It's good I'm don't close to one, lest I gain a few pounds."}
{"text":"Chiba Hut deserves better than two stars but that's how my visit was today. I have eating restrictions and I get that it's a pain, but no cheese is pretty freaking easy. Anyways I get my sandwich with cheese. Ok stuff happens. They make me a new one. It has other items on it that I can't eat and asked to not have on there and by now many other sandwiches have come out and my friends have almost finished theirs. I start picking peppers off my sandwich while one of my friends find a big ass hair in her sandwich. She got refunded. I got a \"free sandwich\" covered in cheese that no one wants (or can eat) I was so frustrated I didn't even want to eat anymore. I feel like I just wasted 25 bucks. Over priced bullshit is not what I come here for."}
{"text":"This place has some amazing sandwiches. Love the atmosphere and vibe. Try the Cali mist"}
{"text":"I stop here on my dispensary trip. Bartenders are super personable. I've never had a bartender ask my name, shake my hand, and say it's nice to meet me. Super welcoming.
The food is great and cheap and they have my favorite beer (Dales Pale) on tap.
If I could afford eating here every single day for every meal, I would totally do it.
Keep on keeping on, my dudes."}
{"text":"This one of my definitely lat night go to.. sandwiches are always on point and service is always welcoming and warming.. cozy place to sit back..."}
{"text":"If I had a dime (hehe...) for every time I wanted delicious Cheba Hut, but was too lazy to get it...well...I forgot where I was going with that. My point is that they deliver, and within a wide radius at that. Hopefully, it's in that groovy microbus. 

They also cater, which is nice because let's face it--guys like me can probably eat a whole tray. I'll have them bring a platter or five to my workplace, and hopefully they can throw in some Bob Marley posters and glow in the dark stickers. Okay, I'll settle for another 4/20 frisbee.

In any case, any minor complaint I had about this place is either improved or easily forgotten. I could be vegetarian and just sustain myself with your magic mushroom subs every day. Oh, the alfalfa sprouts...someone just got the munchies."}
{"text":"I understand everyone smokes weed, but come on at least get the order right. I used to order a sub at least 3-4times a week but not anymore since employees still can't take a correct order"}
{"text":"Always yummy. Kinda pricy but worth it! Takes a little while to get the good out, but once it's ready, the wait is beyond worth it. Kali Mist is my favorite."}
{"text":"Yea man, yea. That was awesome. Get the blunt so you can satisfy your munchies an hour later with leftovers."}
{"text":"No a big fan of sandwiches. But this place is the truth !! Ordered the Kali Mist and a friend of mine got the 5-0. The 5-0  was flame. The bread on sandwich was perfect !"}
{"text":"This shop has some of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The name clearly references pot and each sandwich is named after a different type of weed. Say what you will about pot, but don't let that turn you off from this amazing restaurant. Try the Cali club on wheat or the garlic bread to start. The ingredients are fresh and best of all... They deliver!"}
{"text":"Great toasted subs!  Pic of roast beef pinner in garlic bread.  Pretty full at lunchtime with ASU students but worth the wait.  Prices are a bit steep (would have given 5 stars but for this fact). Pinner (med) sub, chips and drink $12 w/ Tax"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are fantastic... seriously. This place would be 5 star except for the location being pretty ghetto and the novelty of the stoner theme wears off almost immediately. Still, a good sandwich place is a good sandwich place - this is very reliable grub...

I wish I was close enough for them to deliver."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review because I have normally had great experiences with Cheba Hut, but today was just poor customer service. So for this specific review I will keep it to this specific experience. 

It's April 20, which of course means this place would be busy. We called to place an order for pickup, only to have the phone hang up on us repeatedly. By the fifth phone call someone answered and quickly shouted, \"Hey, good luck next time!\"

Realizing we were being tossed to the side, I figured I would try one more time. This time someone else answered the phone and more kindly explained that they weren't taking orders over the phone or online due to the high volume. That's all well and good. However, if this is going to be the case, at least create an automatic voice message stating the fact if you know you're going to get inundated with phone calls. That would be far better than ignoring calls and rudely telling off potential customers.

Every other experience here has been great, but this one really irked us."}
{"text":"The subs are to die for! Me and my boyfriend get The Blunt and The chronic! I normally get it to go! It's not in the nicest area but the food is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches.  I like the white widow the best.  Get it with some yellow peppers... yum."}
{"text":"Cheba Hut had a vision from an Amsterdam trip and is growing the dream to legally sell Chronic, ATF, Kush and more. 

   I get the special of the day because this is a rare place were most of the sandwiches are worth the try.  I also treat my self to a rice Krispy treat.  The restaurant has been seen as a great concept and can be found in many states. Its great to see a business find success with a Hippy concept.  

Erik T. thinks Subway is great, go ahead man yelp about all the great subways in AZ I can't wait to read them."}
{"text":"What a witty little \"hut\" I've found...
The sammies are all called funky names (cuter than E&G) and are the kind of thing you want when your tasters are enhanced as they sometimes are at night after studying and rewarding oneself with \"a treat\" 
Fresh ingredients and house made ranch sauce to die for! 
Fav sandwiches: All Pig, White Widow and all the veggies you could ask for... Then when you think it couldn't get any better..... They ask if you want it grilled-BAM!!!! I'm hooked. 
Full bar too or soft drinks and Kool-Aid!  Uber fantastic for that dry mouth you have from your \"cold\" or \"allergies\" haha
And there are new sides not just chips but baked pretzel nuggets  with cheese sauce, salads, and the sweet treats, ohhhhh the sweet treats.... Captain Crunch Berries Bar, Goo Balls, and Fruity pebbles bars.... 
Staff has always been amazing...patient, don't mind answering questions, helpful, and courteous.  Made me feel very welcome. 
Everything you need to satisfy your cravings. 
When you're hungry for a sub with a certain flair, beat feet Dow to Cheba Hut for a Blunt, Pinner, or Nug. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"LOVE CHEBA HUT! Best sandwich place by far. It's so nice that it's right across the street from school. I always get the Kali Mist, it's excellent every time. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Best place. Better than the Tempe location in my opinion. Nicer staff, things don't get messed up. Food tastes better too."}
{"text":"The food is delicious hands down my favorite sandwich spot .The staff was kind and easy to talk to. I had the the power plant sandwich and it was excellent the drinks were good too. I can't wait to go again. I'm so glad they came to Vegas."}
{"text":"This Review is simple one to write Everything is awesome Im very picky eater. The kind is really good. Very fresh veggies mushroom were the best thing on the sandwich they serve them raw love this place. They have beer which is a plus!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't eat because, well, the line was about 30 feet long.

But they had a fire dancer and tarot readings outside.

Meh."}
{"text":"This review has been a long time coming. Went there for the first time in 6 months the other day, and yet again got harassed by an employee. The food and some of the staff is awesome, don't get me wrong... But what I've experienced is completely unaccepted for even the crappiest plaza food joint.
I live nearby. When I'd come by for lunch 6 months ago, several male employees there have sexually harassed me. Asked for the owner's number, and after a good 10 minutes of them trying to \"apologize\" to me they gave me a number... that was either fake or disconnected. One of the girls there kept apologizing to me and kept saying \"This is a problem here, nobody's doing anything about it, I'm so sorry... They treat us like that too.\" I've also witnessed some of the scummy dudes literally shove themselves into a booth with a female customer they didn't know and try to get their number. Not cool, that's literally scary behavior. People don't come there to get creeped on, they come there to eat.
The few times I've come for a really late dinner, I've seen 1 specific staff SEVERAL TIMES!!! (NOT EVEN EXAGGERATING!!) go into the bathroom for a long time and come out with a blown out nose... This place is run by cokeheads. Really sad. I'd rather go to the Tempe location tbh, where the vibes are still good, but I'm so disappointed that I'm kind of over Cheba Hut in general."}
{"text":"I had bad experiences at the Glendale location and swore off this place... But damn it, the sandwiches are superior to any other place. I came in to this spot tonight and I'm very impressed by this location. Lots of cool people work there, always friendly. They were pretty busy when I came in but I still got my sandwich in about ten minutes. Pink-haired girl waitress and the guy in sunglasses that takes the orders gave me a really cool experience. Glad to see this store still has good vibes and service. Plus there's a bar there! I had the White Widow and a peanut butter ball and was not disappointed. Not too oily, not too bland, perfect dinner."}
{"text":"This place is a killer triple-threat. Atmosphere, food, and service will all blow your mind. 

The restaurant is clean and friendly. There's a really chill vibe, and the whole place is decked out with music references. It's a really great place to bring friends or just scoot over to by yourself. It really is lovely. 

Food is at a wonderful price, especially considering the quality - you can get your grub on and not break the bank. If you go, you should really get a White Widow, grape Kool-aid, and a cereal bar. It'll fuck you up in the best way possible. So good. 

The service is what really closed the 5-star review for me. After my friends and I ordered, we all noted how friendly, warm, and professional the man taking our order was. I was with a bunch of friends once and my pretzel bites were taking a while to come out - I wasn't upset, didn't complain, didn't say anything... but when my food came out, the gentleman who took my order apologized and gave me some coupons for the wait. It was a very proactive thing to do and really solidified the quality of service the staff provided. Ever get customer service so good it makes you misty? Yeah. You'll get that here. 

10/10 would Cheba again"}
{"text":"Best Sub I've had anywhere hands down. The T rex was carnivor heaven. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I really like this place! It's yummy and they are very nice about me coming up with a personal sub that I will like! I will admit I'm not sure what the whole buzz about Cheba Hut is. If it's a choice between Cheba Hut and subway, I'll pick Cheba Hut, but not my first choice."}
{"text":"Love this place, and it's super convenient that it's right down the road from me. White widow is my ultimate favourite, but all their sandwiches are good:) lot of stoners that go in here so be ready for that atmosphere! Yum!"}
{"text":"What great find. Super chill atmosphere. Our first experience was terrific. The food is amazing, the people are amazing. Great location right next to the Source"}
{"text":"love love this place. my favorite is the kali mist. prices are great and good customer service. took my brother for the first time and he loved it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They have bomb sandwiches and munchies for after. The staff is friendly and welcoming. They also have a full service bar to wash your subs down. Everything in the place is marijuana themed, which makes it a fun place to go when you have he munchies. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I just ate one of the best sandwiches I have had in a long time! Thank you so much for giving me such a pleasure experience.  The Koolaid is so delicious, it must be \"SPIKED\". :)"}
{"text":"Cheba Cheba y'all...this place has a great selection of subs and soups, plus the service is great. They always treat me like I'm a friend that they've known for years. My first time, and everyone I've brought for their first time, received half off their bill. Not sure if thats what they do for everyone or if its because I brought hot chickas in. There have been many occassions where I've seen people come in baked and put unnecessary toppings on sandwiches.  Like mayo, mustard, lettuce--the works, on a meatball sandwich--which is funny and harmless, just be warned. They also have great desserts for people with the munchies. 4-20 is a big holiday here too and it's funny to see people out of their minds demolishing food, plus you get free stuff!"}
{"text":"the Griefo Blunt with the Hemp Cream Cheese on Garlic Bread was FN Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Best Sub in Vegas and it's not weed talking. My friend went into depression when his sub was almost gone. He's now seeking therapy. Victor, thank you for listening to our problems!#bringbackranchwrestling"}
{"text":"I never really bought in to the whole Cheba Hut crap.  I mean, is it really that original to put sandwiches named after weed on the menu and have a delivery van with a giant joint on top of it in a college town? 

I can just see their thought process now...\"There are a lot of college kids in Tempe.  College kids love weed.  Let's open up a marijuana-themed sandwich shop and we'll rake in the dough!\"

I always just thought it was kind of dumb.  And it seems more people go for the novelty of it than for the actual food.  Hmm. I guess the marketing ploy worked.

As for the food, it's pretty good.  The sandwiches are tasty enough, but as for the employees, well they're usually high. They'll be more than a little toasted as they toast your sandwich, but I guess that's the point, right?"}
{"text":"Ahhhh Cheba Hut...a friend told me when I first moved to Tempe that I had to try it so she took me there. HILARIOUS theme and great sandwiches. What more can you ask for?! Some may not appreciate the decor (ahem...) but you'll still appreciate the food! My personal favorite is the AK 47 which is basically a french dip with mushrooms and onions (and whatever else you want on it including parmesan and oregano). My boyfriend has tried both the Thai Stick (teriyaki chicken) and the Bbq Chicken (I forget the witty name of it) and a friend of mine loves the Midwests Best (an Italian club of sorts). The line can sometimes e long but all in all it's a pretty sweet spot to grab a sandwich!"}
{"text":"Dude, this place ain't half bad and I didn't even have the munchies!  You don't have to be stoned here to enjoy the food.

A variety of sandwiches and such served up with a smile and a side of chips or something.  Doritos anyone?"}
{"text":"So apparently they now charge you an extra $1 for asking for too many veggie toppings...so random how they decide. By this logic someone who orders no veggies on their sub should receive a discount. Moreover, I ordered 9 veggie toppings at no extra charge but my friend ordered 10 and got charged?!??! WHAT! Way to suck like a corporation Cheba Hut! I spent $15 and you can't give me adequate sub veggies?"}
{"text":"major fail Cheba Hut. i love your toasted subs and all but your delivery history with me is a huge joke. 

first time I ordered you took two hours and showed up with super cold food missing most of the things I asked for on my sandwich. 

second attempt. you delivered 2 of 3 drinks we ordered forgot the chips and again did not make my sandwich with the toppings I requested. 

tonight after a year of fearing ordering from you I tried to order again and THIS TIME you said you don't deliver to my address the very address you brought the two previous messed up orders to. 

way to suck Ceba Hut!"}
{"text":"Meh, this place is pretty good.  I've had several different sandwiches, and they've all been tasty.  However, if you're a meat fiend like me, you'll be left wanting more.  This is not unique to Cheba, as most sub places are stingy with the meat.  So pony up the extra $4 or whatever it is to get a reasonable amount of meat.

$12 sandwich and I'm still hungry kinda sucks.

Also, the staff is either stoned, retarded, or both. Which I suppose the name implies."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying the food is good. But when it comes to customer service it really lacks. They don't hustle to help you or make orders. A lot of goofing off, if you want to come here on your lunch break forget it. Unless you come right when they open. It's been 30 mins and I haven't gotten my food yet and I only get a half hour for lunch. So not only will I be late going back to work I won't be able to fully eat or enjoy my food."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The subs are great and the staff is cool and friendly. I'm not sure why it takes so long to get my sandwich out of the toaster thingy but they give you plenty of weed propaganda to look at while you wait. 
If a Cheba Hut sub were to fight a Subway AND a Quiznos sub the Cheba sub would fully kick ass."}
{"text":"So incredibly delicious! I am a vegetarian and the options Cheba Hut have are not lacking in any way! Oh, and they deliver?!? YAAAASSSS! So glad there is a location in Albuquerque, as I am moving there in May."}
{"text":"If they weren't at a convenient location by ASU I swear...  This one is not on the ball. The sandwiches were correct(ish) and timely but the staff left me perplexed. I wasn't asked at the beginning or end if I wanted any added toppings, which I thought was standard practice but whatever. Then when I asked for toppings I was looked at like I was weird... Excuse meee! Tasted good but the \"Dank\" is always sloppy, maybe people like but I don't, the bread is not crisp, soggy somehow, with sauce that spills out when picking it up and that makes the pepperoni slide out with the cheese... But this that the offense deserving of one star? No, but their communication is. 

I got a PRIVATE message from that manager/owner asking for my PHONE number to figure out what went wrong when my review is pretty black and white spelled out. It's not my fault or my job to talk about what the staff did wrong. Whatever needs to be said can be in an email or message. If I was just believed and spoken with decently I wouldn't be so disgruntled. I still drive 30min+ to visit the mcc one so the ingredients aren't the issue."}
{"text":"Never disappointed! We have ordered from here 4-5 times and food is always on point! Order is always correct, dudes that work there are total sweethearts! And did I mention the food is AMAZING! Good job Glendale Cheba Hut!"}
{"text":"To be blunt, hemp cream cheese on a sandwich is genius! As a vegetarian, I am always looking for decent sandwich places. Cheba Hut's relaxing atmosphere, friendly staff and GREAT sandwiches keep me returning. Friends and non-vegetarians that I have taken to Cheba Hut enjoy their sandwiches so much so that they return themselves. My personal favorite is the Griefo. If you can, save room for a brownie!"}
{"text":"Cheeba Hut is everything you'd expect it to be...and more! You can't help but giggle in a place that takes the stoner theme and applies it to everything they do. But seriously, all tokes aside...their food is BOMB. I mean seriously delicious. If you're looking for a delicious sandwich, look no further. Whether you're into the pot thing or not, you'll be a fan of this place after one bite. 

Overall, best sandwiches in the area...hands down."}
{"text":"I will be here again! It's quick and close to my work. I love toasted sandwiches and they have taken it to the next level. With style!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Pint and a pinner!! Can't go wrong with the green crack or the bomb!!! Yum yum"}
{"text":"Ya know I love this place, been going here for years, so I decided to bring my girl here for the first time, she got herself a Jamaican Red, comes with Olives so she asked for them to be removed, we got it to go so when we got home she was pretty disappointed to find the sandwich still had olives plus it was loaded up with everything she never asked for (lettuce, pickles, tomatoes ect.) so yeah not the happiest, she knew there was going to be something wrong cause the whole time the dude was making our sandwiches he wasn't paying attention, just flirting with some girl from the bar."}
{"text":"No number of cash promotions can save this place.

As a disclaimer, I have been fortunate enough to visit the Cheba Hut on The Hill in Boulder, and I am astonished at how starkly contrast my experiences have been between the two locations.

At its core, Cheba Hut offers unique and quite tasty sandwiches at an appropriate price. The Magic Mushroom sandwich with the works is probably the best vegetarian sandwich available via delivery in Madison, and I've heard The Kind is also super solid.

That being said, it is so disappointing to have a would've-been-amazing meal ruined by the worst customer service the fast food industry has to offer. My in-store experience was mediocre at best, my food having taken fifteen minutes in a line of two sandwiches. Employees aren't helpful, and don't seem to know what they're responsible for. It generally seems disorganized.

When you order for delivery, your sandwich might arrive in an hour fifteen (if it arrives at all, because this store doesn't seem to honor every order, based on whether or not they feel like making and delivering it -- seriously) wrapped in aluminum foil, soggy because of poor packaging and cold because it sat around fully dressed before someone felt like delivering it.

It's disappointing craving a Magic Mushroom sandwich and not wanting to put up with lousy management to get it."}
{"text":"Love Cheba Hut, favorite sandwich hands down would be the white widow. Jamaican red is delicious too. The hippie vibes are awesome and I never thought I would enjoy a white chocolate beer until I tried one here. Def on my faves list"}
{"text":"I WISH WE HAD THIS PLACE IN LA!! Every time i visited my girlfriend in AZ i would come here. Its a stoner themed sandwich spot where everything is made fresh and they serve beer. I've been meaning to drive out to San Diego to give the one out there a try. I love their Orange Widow!"}
{"text":"Solid food but an easy turn off for people people not into weed culture."}
{"text":"We order from Cheba hut all the time, they're usually quick, foods perfect and staff is awesome. Recently however, I'm not sure what's changed but our order has been wrong multiple times. Last time the Au Jus for my French dip was missing. Today the service has been so bad I'm not sure I'll give them another chance. I ordered at 6:03, food arrived around 7:20. Our order was wrong missing Au jus for the TWO FRENCH DIPS we ordered. Called at 723 to complain since this messes up my whole meal. We're told as soon as the driver got back they'd bring it out. Called at 803 and was told they'd be right here again at 8:40. They offered to send a whole new order right away and the driver was on the way. 9:17.... Still NOTHING. They don't call or show up, and were advised we should return the uneaten food. Over 3 hours! Worst service I've ever had and not even any sort of remorse. If you order make sure it's hours before you want to eat or just go in. 


Update: was contacted by the owner regarding our experience and was told the store would contact us to make this right. However, we never heard anything back, which was the whole issue to begin with. We ordered from Cheba weekly, but I won't spend another penny there with such poor customer service."}
{"text":"Great place to catch a quick bite! The atmosphere was very chill, pleasant, and very clean. The food was awesome if you are a fan of sandwiches def come on by and check this place out. I had the French dip it was great... Doing this review a couple days later and my month is watering... Sooooo I know where I am going for lunch today!!"}
{"text":"Currently waiting for my sandwich. It's onto minute 27. Staff is extraordinarily slow and have no idea what they're doing. Unsurprisingly, they're probably high."}
{"text":"Cool place with lots of yummy food choices for sandwiches N such I love the thematic layout inside. Very popular dining place for lunch. Close to the MCC college. I'm addicted"}
{"text":"Cheba Hut. I think this place is okay. The pokalolo was my favorite sandwich. I have gone into this place many times, but always felt like something was either missing or needed to change. I don't think I ever really picked up on what that thing was. I will say that there is a lot of people who love this place. 

I think it is a bit overrated and got tired of the whole weed theme behind it. I also felt slightly disgusted by some of the people who made my sandwiches there (taking a shower is too mainstream for some of them)."}
{"text":"Good stuff! Had a tuna melt with banana peppers there this week. Great Garlic herb bread. Good choice of munchies and desserts, too. Plus Kool-Aid fountain drinks and good tunes. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very fun  atmosphere in the place. The staff was awesome and it had super good vibes to hang out and enjoy my sub. 

As for the food, the sizes of the subs and the amount of stuff they put in the sandwiches is better than gracious, but my only complaint was the bread. I could have just been there on a less than impressive day (and I hope so) but the bread was just a bit more hard and chewy than what I enjoy. All together it was a good enough experience for me to return to give the bread another shot, but there was definitely some room for improvement."}
{"text":"I three-star rating has to do with their cleanliness and it is very dirty restaurant. It really shouldn't take your kids here they've got pot paraphernalia and posters all over the wall. Their bathrooms have graffiti in F bombs everywhere. They're in a junky area, but they are always busy. I got to give them props for their sandwiches, they are good! You got a really be on them about their subs because they do mess up quite a bit, more often than not they mess up and miss something on your sandwich. they have a load of rice crispy treats."}
{"text":"Good food, of course nice people, and my type of atmosphere. I'm from Arizona, so it was nice being at a place I'm familiar with! Will return if in Downtown. Got the AK-47 Sandwich and was on point. But it was a slow time and it took longer than I expected for them to make, could be a little quicker, But no biggy! 
Peace and love"}
{"text":"OMMMMMGGGGGGG!!!!!! 
This place is good. I go the recommended white widow sandwich... It was bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the sandwich place to be when you are craving a sandwich! I came here a few times during my work lunch break but this is the first time I brought my family here. We live in Gilbert and usually go somewhere closer, but I really wanted them to try this place.

We got the AK-47 with extra mushrooms, the kind, kali mist and side of fire bread. My mother in-law and my 13yr loved it. Ate all their sandwiches and the fire bread. The bread was perfectly crispy and soft. 

Now be aware the decor and the display, is not kids appropriate and yes my kid did ask about it which is fine, you can't really hide reality anymore lol. The decor consist of pipes, bongs, fake blunts etc.....But it sure didn't stop my kid from asking me to bring him back for the sandwiches."}
{"text":"It had long been a dream of The Rob to open his very open Cheba Hut near GCC.  When we recently found out that someone had beaten him to it, he was a bit sad but also excited for the now close proximity of his favorite herbal-themed eatery.  This location is located in a strip mall along with a Circle K, tattoo parlor and Trails.  (If you're familiar with the area, Trails took over the large space once occupied by the nudie bar and Cheba Hut took over the old Trails space.)

Whether you're a big ol' stoner or a sober square like myself you'll enjoy the tasty sandwiches with funny names.  We even took The Rob's parents for a visit so that his conservative, vegetarian mom and his formerly-tie-die-wearing dad could enjoy the goodness, which they most certainly did.

Only complaints: 
1) Pepsi products instead of Coke
2) As stated before, the toasting does take a little while, so you have to wait a little bit for them to bring your sandwich to the topping bar.
3) Lacking in chip selection.  I mean, c'mon, you run an establishment themed around the chronic and you don't offer BAKED chips?"}
{"text":"If you love sandwiches and are apart of the legalizing mary jane movement then here's the place to go! They have about 4 different flavors of Kool-Aid as well as liquor for u drinkers out there. The entire staff is cool fits tempe down to the T. If you have the munchies and you are in the tempe area check it out"}
{"text":"Wow, such an awesome place to eat at. The bread is awesome, the subs are amazing and the goo balls (peanut butter rice crispies) are to die for.  There's a reason this is a stoner's paradise.

Tip: get the spicy ranch, I don't care what you put it on, get it."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this place! 
Great vibe 
Helpful staff 
Awesome decor 
Big enough to easily find a table 
They got booze 
A million sandwiches to choose from 
Delicious food 
And best of all CHEAP"}
{"text":"THEY LIKE TO SPIT IN YOUR FOOD THEN LIE TO YOUR FACE ABOUT IT.  

The whole story:
I come to this place for the first time ever.  Order a sandwich and wait. I see the girl whose supposed to be making my food  \"Kara\" glaring at my friend and I and NOT making my food.  Then I See three different people come after me and get their sandwiches and leave.  Still no food for me.  
So I go up and ask her about it nicely, asking if she forgot.  She rolls her eyes at me,  looks right where she left it before and goes yeah uhhh I'll get on that. Then some other girl \"sarah\"  comes up and decided to SPIT IN MY SANDWICH. I was watching her the entire time.  I have to go and demand the remake the sandwich.  They play dumb and lie to my face.  It gets better.  They say \"I didn't spit on your food I was just talking about how you talked shit about the service\" 

1. Getting Served AFTER other people who came over 10 mins after I placed my order then asking about it is hardly talking shit about the service.  Even if I did.  I had the right to complain about the fact that my food was never made.  Food I fucking paid for.  
2. IT DOESNT TAKE 2 PEOPLE TO MAKE A DAMN SANDWICH. 
3. Talking doesn't involve leaning over and producing a white thing from your mouth.  Or anything tangible from your mouth.  

The manager did a great job at taking care of me,  he refunded my money and made my sandwich himself with me standing there(at his suggestion)  although I didn't see her getting in trouble on the spot.  

I would have liked to SEE her getting written up or fired so I know it happens because no one who spits in food and argues and lies deserves to work in food service or customer service.  

Place was cute overall but unless you like being treated with blatant disrespect for no reason  go elsewhere."}
{"text":"A bit of a wait but the roast beef 8\" Piner was big in terms of what's on it. They gave me some foil and a bag to take my other half home. The decor and ambiance was quite Interesting. The sandwich was quite yummy the next day by the way. They let you add many different things on your sandwich."}
{"text":"I came here when they first opened and got a salad. The food was decent, but the service was slow. I would try them again now that they are a little more settled."}
{"text":"So happy they brought a Cheba Hut out here!  A bar of craft beers w/ daily specials and altogether good vibes!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for toasted subs. Wowza. And they have koolaid!! The subs were very tasty and fulfilling. I had the dank pinner sub but without cream cheese. The bf had a huge sub called the blunt something lol with giardinara peppers (Midwest thing). I would highly recommend. Will come back to try out other subs. He also had the fat Albert grape drank which was on par. Yum o!"}
{"text":"I love Cheba Hut we order it for lunch at work at least once or twice a month. Sandwich's are always spot on and flavorful. My favorites are the Jamaican Red and White Widow, all white meat chicken very tasty. I order the pinner size and I'm always full. The menu makes everyone laugh when they read it. What's even better now is they deliver, I love their slogan if you're too high we'll fly."}
{"text":"I don't support the lifestyle often associated with pot smokers or the legalization recreationally BUT this place has good tasting hot or cold subs full of flavor! They don't skimp on the ingredients even the meat. It is definitely NOT cheap tho"}
{"text":"Cheba Hut used to be one of my favorite restaurants to eat at. The quality of the food and customer service has gone down so much. Just yesterday I was there an ordered their bacon and chicken salad. The chicken was basically Frozen inside not very appetizing whatsoever bitting into half frozen food. they also forgot my ranch dressing with my salad  salad so everything was very very dry to say the least. Thank God I had some in my fridge to.add flavor and moisture Earl to solid wouldn't have even been edible."}
{"text":"Great food, the reason for 3 stars is their delivery service, order is almost always wrong and food is cold when arrives, i would highly recommend eating in or pick up only. Staff have always been friendly."}
{"text":"The BEST sandwiches! I wish I had pics but I'm always too busy eating my sandwiches! I started coming here because I heard a few people rave and now I even go out of my way to eat here. You don't get shorted on sandwich meat or any other ingredients which is the best part. The staff is really friendly.. They even say hi while your waiting for your order. I've been meaning to try their desserts because they look amazing."}
{"text":"Not a very good first impression. Kali kush missing avocado. Asked for no tomato, got it anyway. Kind was missing extra meat and cheese. Nachos were missing olives and ranch, not to mention they looked disgusting and burnt. Didn't taste much better. Bought a cookie and had to ask the cashier 4 times to ring it up. Sandwich was still really good, but damn, guys wtf. I'll give it another shot because I liked the sandwich and the menu looked good. Maybe it's just this location."}
{"text":"A coworker and I decided to have Cheba Hut delivered to work for lunch. I ordered the White Widow (Ranch, chicken, cheese, bacon, mushrooms, herb bread) and they ordered a Panama Red (chicken, marinara sauce, cheese, garlic herb bread). The employees were friendly which I appreciate! The delivery was very fast also and kudos to the young man who found the correct building and entrance because there are multiple in my area. The sandwiches were still warm and I still have half my sandwich left over for dinner.

*They also included two free fountain drinks for the next time either of us plan to stop by any of the Cheba Hut locations. Discounts make me smile. :)"}
{"text":"Baked or not, this place rocks! Awesome sandwiches, look-Aid and delicious rice crispy treats, can't ask for much more than that"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with any menu choice here. A stoner's dream munchie stop! White widow is my fAvorite! Such a fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and vibe. I love this place and the sandwiches are BOMB, and the service is just as awesome, this place deserves every 5 star review"}
{"text":"They deliver. Anyone who appreciates...ahem...\"stoner culture\" and delivers is truly where I want to give my money. Thier reverence of all things herbal shows in the sandwiches. They're aesthetically pleasing and loaded with goodies you can't get at ol' subway. Let them ruin other sandwich shops for you, whether you partake or not."}
{"text":"This place has got some awesome sandwiches and a fun concept! Its been a while so I cant remember what sandwich I had, but I do remember it was really really good. I wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"This place has by far the best sandwiches and subs around. The atmosphere is the 60s hippie culture and the  subs and other items on the menu are named after marijuana strains.  If you want a awesome sub you want to visit this place, and this is coming from a 60 yr old. Enjoy."}
{"text":"It's hard for  sub place to distinguish itself, but Cheba pulls it off. If I'm in the mood for a sub, this is one of my very top go-to places. Some interesting combinations I've not seen elsewhere (the whole pig - five kinds of pork deli), some cool munchies (froot loops marshmallow treats), and a friendly stoner vibe that seems legit and not just a marketing gimmick."}
{"text":"Yeah great, everything's about weed. ha ha ha. I don't know if it was designed by an actual stoner who started smoking something a little too strong, or a 5 year old who was told about weed and now wants to fill every inch of his life in the paraphernalia. This place is the embodiment of the term sellout. Take every popular strain they could think of and force it to be the name of something disgusting they leak out of the kitchen. Throw a few things together that don't need to be anywhere near each other, and hey charge 3 times what it's worth while they're at it. Why stop at ripping off the names for food? Just cover every weak pot joke you can find online to a poster and leave no original wall space left. Nothing worth a second or third visit, or a first. If you really get high and got the munchies, take a stroll down the chip aisle at the dollar store. You will be much more satisfied that night~"}
{"text":"Tasty munchies at this spot! Pick your poison Koolaide or Beer with your toasted sandwich. White widow is one of my favs...making me hungry now!"}
{"text":"My niece is in town and requested sandwiches for lunch.  After researching on yelp,  I thought I'd give Cheba a try.  We were not disappointed! The sandwiches were amazing! High quality ingredients and flavorful sauces.  The atmosphere was super chill and the service was great.  This will be a regular stop for us!"}
{"text":"This place is a fun place for Lunch or Snack sandwiches are good and have fun names. I've gone here quite a few times."}
{"text":"While the whole weed/pothead vibe is most definitely NOT my scene, I totally respect how well this place has set itself apart from your typical sub shop. 

I went with the 8 inch White Widow (supposedly a weed pun I'm not aware of). Decently tasty! I loved the ranch sauce paired with the cheese and chicken. It came out warm and freshly toasted (none of the weird subway zap toasting). That being said, don't expect the sub to be ready to eat anything less than 5-10 min as they do prepare these as you order. 

I like that this place has a legit bar complete with a happy hour and could see how some folks might dig the marijuana vibe. 

The food wasn't anything I feel I couldn't get elsewhere, but was glad to try out this supposed AZ staple. 

8 in sub + chips and drink will run you about $11 so not much of a steal, but worth trying if you're in the area."}
{"text":"How could you NOT LOVE Cheeba hut. Since it opened I have been getting

WHITE WIDOW
with parm, oregano, oil, chipotle mayo and pepercinis... so amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!


Some of the staff is uhh.... weird tho!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the sandwiches here. I don't think I've ever tasted anything that was short of fantastic- from the side dishes to the variety of sweet munchies such as the Captain Crunch or Fruity Pebble treats. I only knock a star off for the fact that I have to \"get over\" the theme. It's kinda funny, sure, but it makes me feel a little skeezy to eat at a weed-themed restaurant. At least it knows it's nitch and doesn't try and be anything it's not- it's an inexpensive sandwich shop near a college campus that serves brownies and kool-aid. 

That aside, I still regularly enjoy their food despite their hippie atmosphere and often take out of town guests here (provided they're not TOO uptight, of course). 

It's one of those places that, regardless of your feeling on the theme, you should probably at least try once."}
{"text":"I always get the white widow and the quality is always good. Usually I pick up but last night I ordered delivery and I think from now on I will pick up or go elsewhere. I gave them my complete address but the driver was too lazy to bring the sandwich to my apartment. He called me and said he was out front, which is unusual for a delivery driver. He then asked me to come and get my sandwich from the parking lot. My apartment complex is very small and my apartment is easy to find, I'm not sure why he didn't even attempt to deliver my sandwich. I then proceeded to walk down to the parking lot and get my food. The guy was sitting in his car texting and finally unlocked the door after I knocked on his window so I could grab my food off the seat of his car without him ever glancing up from his phone. Food is good but customer service is awful."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a French dip person but couldn't resist ordering an ak47 in public. Loved coming here.  Fun theme.  Beer!!!  Good stuff too.  Except.... PBR ?????  Yuck."}
{"text":"Best sandwich place ever!!! Jamaican red is my personal favorite. For extra kick try it with the spicy ranch dressing... Very neat place and has one of a kind sandwiches and treats for a great price! Super friendly hippy chic and trendy with superior staff!"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times since I moved to Tempe. Parking isn't too bad, you can park in the front or back which is nice if one lot is too full. Usually never lines when I go in but the one time there was the employees took all of the orders pretty fast. I've only had a few issues here. One being I asked for no olives on my sandwich when placing a phone order, I got olives on my sandwich even though I asked for none. The other time, I came here around 8:30/9 at night for two sandwiches and had a buy one get one 50% off coupon I wanted to use. The employees (a female) rang me up, I told her I had a reward I wanted to use so I typed in my phone number to pull it up, I asked her if I could use it today because it expired in a few days from when I went in. After telling her TWICE I wanted to use it she rang me up and completed my order without using the code. Ummm excuse me? Are you high? Probably, because she definitely looked and acted like it. The sandwiches I got as well that day were the worst I've had here so far. They both were super dry and barely had anything on them. Honestly that last experience kind of ruined it for me so next time I'm craving a sandwich, I probably will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"A friend once gave me a list of reasons to enroll at MCC, the first of which being \"Cheba Hut is right across the street!\" 

The subs are amazing. I'd tell you what my favorite sub on the menu is, but all that would end with is me giving you a link to their menu. It's ALL good, even the vegetarian stuff (and I don't usually LIKE vegetarian subs).  And then there are the munchies. Oh god, the munchies are awesome. I'm personally a fan of their goo balls (a giant ball of PB covered rice krispies with cocoa and honey) and their hemp brownies. 

On top of that, everyone who works there is pretty much made of win."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! I've had about 4 or 5 subs and I have loved every one so far. Service has been impeccable each time and the desserts are a must!"}
{"text":"Where has this sandwich shop been all my life?! 

The hubby and I were out on a Sunday afternoon and this place popped in my head for food cuz the hubby was getting the grumpies, lol. So I pulled out my handy dandy yelp app and found a location near us! And by George were we glad I did! Starting with the decor and the friendly greeting to the sandwiches everything was bomb diggity! The food so good I wish I got a bigger size! I got the Kali mist and the hubby got the dank sandwich. I was \"highly\" impressed and so was my husband with his choice. Right amount of spice with the chipotle mayo too. 

Definitely glad we stopped in here today, will definitely be back in the future to try the other wonderful looking sandwiches! :)"}
{"text":"By far the best sandwich shop out there, I got the the Veggie sandwich with cream cheese.  So delicious, all ingredients are fresh and tasty.  If you haven't tried you must asap"}
{"text":"The White Widow is my go to here, chicken with ranch, mushrooms, provolone, and lightly toasted. The atmosphere is new age reggie (american version) which is a fun change in the usual sub sandwich interior. Some of the murals and art work are a little risqué for younger eyes and may have some suggested themes but for the college scene it fits right in. Overall I like the food and service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Was a regular here. Used to visit once a week. Now after two visits in a row of them 'losing' my order, I am considering going elsewhere. At the time I didn't have time to wait for a remake. They offered me brownies and chips as consolation. That just didn't reverse my frustration. 

The sign on the wall says something like \"quality takes time, it will be a miracle if you get your sandwich in less than 5 minutes\". This is acurate. The sandwiches are good. Some unique combinations, combined with great herb garlic bread makes the sandwiches nearly worth the 8 bucks you are going to shell out. However, a Jimmy Johns opened a mile or two down the street. I get my food in 1 minute and haven't had an order \"lost\". 

I would have given them 4 stars prior to the last two visits, but the continuous loss of my confidence and over priced food brings it down to a two. It will be some time before I make it back to cheba."}
{"text":"Idk how I feel about this area,  pretty scary. :/

First timer here!!! Ryan with the beard is so friendly, funny and full of energy.  I like him :))  and very helpful since I was so indecisive on my vegetarian subs. I end up getting the griefo, that's what Ryan suggested.  It was good. He put too much mayonnaise in it. But other than that, it was good.

Geez. The gooo balls, the chocolate chip cookies and the rice Krispy treat..... sooo good. Yet so freakin bad for you.  Haha.

so... people watching was interesting.  Haha I felt like I was in high school all over again. Every single person who walked in was literally stoned!! Haha. Smh. Funnnyyyy. 
I like the bob Marley posters :))

I shall be coming back.  :))"}
{"text":"Wow what a find and right next to a POT store so looking at the menu your see the reference to the munchies, cotton mouth cures and secret stash. A fun place with great sandwichs and salads. He had the Italian sub and antipasto salad. Excellent!  Will be back again."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say. I walked in expecting my usual drunk food glory. But I was met with a manager that said I was not welcome because it was too late for them to serve my group. ( we arrived at 12:30 and they pride themselves on being a drunk food haven)

In the past their food and management was so polite and delicious. But unfortunately since it changed hands last winter it has been nothing but a let down."}
{"text":"I come here often and have yet to try anything that didn't taste good. Today it's the Mekong High, their newest sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Solid sandwiches. Got the 5-0. The sandwich isn't overdone. Proper meat to veggies ratio, good bread, friendly staff. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So freaking good.. I love Capriotti's but hubs and I were getting burnt out on it. We tried this place and now it's a new fav! The cashier told us to check out the white widow which my husband loved! Everyone was super friendly.. looked like a fun place to work. Bathrooms were clean.. overall great experience."}
{"text":"Okay we went in a group of eight at noon, so the place is packed with people and busy, we expected that. took us about 10 min to place order which was fine; rush hour. I Ordered white widow, blunt with guacamole sauce came to about 11$
The fun part started, waiting for our sub, after about 15 min first sub delivered to one of the guys in the group, another 5 min and everyone in the group got their sub but me so I decided to play it cool and be nice and give them some more time.
About half a dozen of people got their subs and I still didn't get mine I asked for my sub and mentioned that I've been waiting for a while, the answer was oh what's your name oh ok yours is coming out in a second, a minute passed and didn't see my sandwich at this time i started getting upset asked again for my sandwich but no one seemed to have a clue about it and the person who seemed in charge looked for my order and said oh yea its coming, 5 min passed and another half a dozen of people went by and I still didn't get my sub. By now about 30 min have passed and more and more people got their food and I'm standing their watching. Went back to the staff and asked for my money back. 
I don't care how good the food looked like or how many people say its taste good, with this rudeness and carelessness this store is worthless. Btw One of the guys in my group got the wrong sandwich.
I might give this store another try if they tried to make it up to me. Would I do it again with a group or a recommend to friend. No.  Don't embarrass yourself and go their.
 I'll let you know if they proven me wrong and contact me through Yulp and show that they do care.
05/15 I guess they really don't care about their customers"}
{"text":"Great service and the sandwich's were good.  Great selection of different sandwich's and salads.  Will be going again.  The rice crispy treats could use a little bit more marshmallows they were a little dry."}
{"text":"The food is decent. I like the salads better than the subs, but I'm picky about toasted bread. The first time I went to Cheba Hut, I liked the theme- toasted subs= stoner food so they have a lot of tie-dye prints and rasta/ stoner inspired art. It's unique, but doesn't cross the line for a college town. I think it fits in perfectly. I've always experienced the staff to be laid back and friendly. They also deliver locally."}
{"text":"Very interesting place. Lot of weed references throughout the restaurant. I got the \"pinner\" (6\") and my boyfriend got the \"blunt\" (12\"). They also have a \"nug\" which is 4\". I ended up getting La Canna Italian sub without black olives. I did ask if they could put green peppers on instead and they said yes but never gave them to me. Also took me a while to order because the employees were busy talking to each other instead of paying attention to customers. I'm pretty sure my boyfriend got the Kush sub. He ate half and threw the rest away. Favorite thing about this place is the garlic & herb bread I got (I could definitely eat it plain)."}
{"text":"Ugh why is this so far from my house? I guess my bank account should be happy it is. I love this place. Toasted sandwiches. Really fun menu items. Chill staff."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to go and eat if you have a sense of humor.  Their sandwiches are very good. The last time I went I had the hummus which was excellent. I also tried one of their homemade rice crispy treats which were also done very well. It was a bit loud when I went there I'm not sure if they have the music that loud all the time, but I enjoyed my food and I wish there was one closer to Gilbert."}
{"text":"Solid place to get your food.  Really good toasted sandwiches.  Good atmosphere too. Took 3 other people for their first time and they were all happy with their food."}
{"text":"Came here for a sub because of the good reviews.  They didnt disappoint.  I had an italian sub and it was one of the best ive ever had.  Also had a rice krispy treat which was fresh and good. The service was very friendly too"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Great sandwiches and really friendly staff. Love the decor and the bar"}
{"text":"So tonight while sitting watching a PBS special about sandwiches hubby and I decided that we needed sandwiches for dinner.  With Yelp's help we decided to try Cheba Hut.  
Who knew my first exposure to drug slang would be in a sub shop.  I have to tell you drug references or not this place knows what they are doing.  
Our sandwiches were awesome!  I definitely will be going back as this is, I know it already, my favorite sub shop.  If you get a chance check this place out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place. I wish they would open even more locations around the valley. My favorite sandwich shop hands down!"}
{"text":"White widow is fire  first time I've ever had cheba hut my boss told me to try it out and omg I'm hooked now"}
{"text":"Would be 5stars because I love Cheba Hut but I had an extremely bad experience at this specific location. I came in with my dog just like I have in the past at other locations only to be taken aback by Trevor's behavior. Immediately telling me to leave, not even asking if he was a service animal, or suggesting their dog friendly patio. After informing him he was a service dog he told me to get \"proof\" when BY LAW, all he is allowed to ask is what service the dog provides. As I attempted to explain this he simply walked away from me leaving me mid-sentence. I was baffled that someone would behave like that in their work place. At no point was I rude to him. I would hate for any one else to deal with such an ill mannered person. Hopefully management has a talk with Trevor. Fortunately the other staff was EXTREMELY nice about the situation and totally made up for it. My sub was amazing as always!"}
{"text":"The owner, Dorian, got in touch with me an apologized for the subpar experience. He also told me to come back in and get a sandwich on the house. If that's not great customer service, I don't know what is. I tried their new sandwich (I forgot the name; it was an asian fusion with pulled pork and jalepenos) and it was S U P E R L A T I V E! The service was awesome too. Happy Abbey indeed."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good. I ate at the Fort Collins Cheba Hut earlier in life and was satisfied with both experiences. The toasted subs are heated on a Quiznos style conveyer belt oven. The staff was very kind a pleasant to deal with. It does seem weird to base a sandwich shop around weed but it worked here."}
{"text":"Cheba always hits the spot, and this location never disappoints. I like the fact that they have a few variations of vegetarian subs. The new ordering style took some getting use to but in the end, it's probably faster. This location now has local brews which is a nice touch. Come here for the best toasted sub in the area."}
{"text":"Fresh toasted subs from the heavens, a fresh alternate to all those bland commercial sub shops.   Good food and friendly service is what you will find here.  Afgani sandwich is hard to beat, but everything is good.  Not to mention they have kool-aid on tap.  Originality and flavor make this place a must. Cool joint."}
{"text":"Is you a stoner? You will probably think this place is cute than. If not, you will probably still think this joint is cute (Ha, get it?). I always order the White Widow (chicken, ranch dressing...) and get a fruity pebbles Krispy treat. I mean, where else can you get those?! Freakin awesome. They have a little bar here now too. The employees are always friendly and the interior is super fun. All of the sandwiches are named with marijuana in mind. Cheba Hut will always be close to my heart LOL."}
{"text":"My daughter and her friends went here a few nights ago. The sandwiches were awesome, until one girl found a piece of chewed gum in her sandwich. Also there were hairs in the sandwiches from the guy who made them. DISGUSTING"}
{"text":"It had been a great long while since I had been to Cheba Hut. I recalled a tiny establishment with almost no places to sit and a friendly staff that took a little while to make your food but it was well worth the wait.

A few days ago, went with the boyfriend here for dinner. To my amazement, the place had been expanded! Tons more kitschy pot themed decor and a lot more tables. Plus, they serve beer now which is pretty cool. You can get a blunt and a beer, haha!  

I ordered the Griefo and my boyfriend ordered the club sandwich. They used to ask you what you wanted on your sandwich as they were making it (a la Subway style) but that has since changed. The staff is very friendly and helpful, I'm glad that part hadn't changed. 

Food arrived relatively quickly and wow, was my Griefo delicious! I hadn't yet experienced hemp cream cheese before because I was never brave enough to try it. The sandwich had really fresh ingredients. Boyfriend quite enjoyed his sandwich as well. Afterwards, we shared a rice krispy treat..opted for the one that had fruity pebbles and froot loops! Yum.

Stop going to Subway (where almost everything is processed-gross) or Jimmy John's (bland) already..it's not nearly as good as Cheba Hut."}
{"text":"The location explains everything about the decor and name of this sandwich shop. If you dare to step inside- you will first be greeted with some of the friendliness staff I've come across in years. As you laugh at the names or remember \"back when\" you will find this isn't your typical sandwich. These are packed with flavor and creativity like non-other.  You will crave the flavor and satisfaction these sandwich's leave you with and have you craving to come back for more.  I could've eaten just the bread...yes the bread is the BOMB!!! Don't wait, don't walk, run to get your grub on!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place . Seriously the best subs I've ever had anywhere hands down ! This is a weed based joint ( haha see what I did there) . I personally don't smoke but it's not geared for onlh pot heads. Overall just omg seriously so good I wanna eat there for breakfast lunch and dinner !"}
{"text":"Stopped into Cheba hut for first time. The guy who took our order was really cool and friendly and helped me narrow down my selection cause there were so many good sounding choices. I got the inferno. It was really good. My son got the best west, and husband got the guillotine. It was Delish! Their bread and sauces was really good. The decor  was cool and fitting.   I got a fruity pebbles treat before I left.  So good and I wasn't even high."}
{"text":"I had the Acapulco gold blunt sandwich and it was great.  The bread was soft and flaky and the ingredients tasted fresh.  The staff was totally cool with me being high and we all laughed.  The black tea is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"My girl and I eat here regularly once or twice a month.  I usually get the 5-0 or Pokalolo blunt and my girlfriend usually gets the Kush blunt and she loves it!  They are always friendly and even though their sign says it'll take a miracle to get the food fast, we've never found ourselves waiting long even during busy times.  This place is a must for anybody who likes sub style sandwiches.  The place always smells amazing, they have TV and great music.  I recommend this place to ANYONE!"}
{"text":"So I gave you guys another shot. Waited 15-20 min for a sandwich and waited while others came and went order #1050904 Cie Cie Katz took my order and hope you guys treat your customers better than the way I was treated"}
{"text":"I've yet to be disappointed any time I come here. Great food, drinks, and atmosphere.  They put any other sub shop to shame (Subway *cough *cough). The staff is always friendly, as they should be at a place where the subs are named after different weed strains. If you haven't been here, I HIGHLY (get it?), recommend that you try it."}
{"text":"I've only beeen here once, but the service was bad enough to write about, whether it was a fluke or per usual.

Which sucks, because the food was pretty good and the atmoshpere 'like way phun, dude'.   It was neat to see Tommy Chong and his wife in photo on the wall, sitting at a crappy table, enjoying the grub.
I also got to reminisce about all the clandestine times I had in this very building when it was a crappy, hole in the wall head shop instead of a crappy hole in the wall sandwich shop, and I was the longhaired leaping gnome tie dyed store manager with my '59 VW panel van parked out front.

But all my daydreaming came to an end when I saw Dopey and Grumpy, the two painted and peirced up grrrls they had running the show, put the big Bogart on customer service skills.  (There was no GIVE in their puffpuffgive equation.)

The lady that had the misfortune to arrive at the ordering counter a few minutes after I received my Aculpolco Gold BBQ chicken sandwhich was there a full 4 1/2 minutes before placing her order.  The whole time, Dopey was in the back area, doing dishes by the sound of it, while Grumpy stood out behind the counter near the grilling area on a personal cell phone call.  She was yelling, crying, dropping F-bombs, and just bleeding drama, while speaking, come to find out, to her mother.  Never a word or even glance at poor, mousey customer, who also said nothing.  Eventually Dopey came back up front and the order ensued, but while it was being made, everyone in the building got the irie joy of hearing Grumpy repeat back to Dopey everything we'd just heard from the phone call.

The owners should put as much effort into having just the right Customer Service as they do into having just the right Look for their staff.   Instead of a Suicide Grrl with crusty hair serving it with bad attitude or indifference, I'd rather have a nerdy, ponytailed, hornrimmed glasses and cardigan wearing book-worm serve me my silly drug-named sandwich with a subtle smile and wink.  As a matter of fact, that sounds kind of sexy..."}
{"text":"It's a fun marijuana-themed sub shop with fantastic subs and great prices.  I would highly (get it?) recommend."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find.... If you know about Cheba Hut tell all of your friends, especially if they're new to the area. My husband and I have been multiple times now and each time it's amazing! 

The Acapulco Gold (BBQ Chicken) is full of so much flavor! It's my go-to sandwich EVERY TIME! Their homemade sauce is toothsome. 

Last BUT not least... their Peanut Butter brownies are.... the most wonderful thing in this world to eat. If you like peanut butter and you like brownies, this is a MUST! Trust me, you won't be disappointed. 

Pre-warning: if you're offended by ANYTHING marijuana then I wouldn't recommend an inside visit. But, if you can slightly get over the names then you should definitely still order online for pick up. It'll be our secret! :)"}
{"text":"Good stuff. Everyone is very nice and it's way laid back. Pricing isn't too spectacular, but this is something I really like to hit when I can."}
{"text":"Peace Children, yeah man, went hungry as a Horse, 
left eyes Red as the Devil's Dick & Cotton-Mouthed. 
Then ran over to Bubby's to play checkers."}
{"text":"I can't believe I hadn't tried this place before...and it is about a mile away from my house! I went last night with the BF after scouring yelp for somewhere to get sandwiches (he wanted a sandwich...I pretty much never want a sandwich). We came across this place, and I'm not sure what it is about it or what I had heard that made me not really want to go here....but I reluctantly agreed. Turns out, it is really and surprisingly good! I got the jamaican red which is chicken (and the chicken is like chunks of chicken breast, which is perfect for this kind of sandwich) some kind of spicy red seasoning/sauce, jalapenos, bell peppers, and cheese. It was really spicy and tasty. The BF got the Thai stick and it was also very good, but with more of a sweet flavor. I like that all of the sandwiches are toasted, and toasted for enough time that the bread is crunchy and everything inside is ooey gooey....a lot of other places can take note that this is like the definition of awesome when it comes to toasting a sandwich. We also got the garlic bread....it was good, very large for the money, but the sandwiches were a bit better.


I would come back here for a good cheap meal again."}
{"text":"This place is PHENOMENAL, I have absolutely NO complaints about this place. Best I've had since moving to AZ. Definitely needs to be featured somewhere on the food channel or somewhere it can be recognized. I would recommend to anyone looking for a GREAT sandwich and a good time. Great atmosphere and large menu. Check them out, it's to die for!"}
{"text":"Cheba Hut could be a 3.5-star review on a few of the times I've gone, but it's never been terrible by any means. My favorite is the Kush (BLT). Garlic is the best bun to get (again, in my opinion). I can't explain it, but everything seems even across the bread and toasted just right. This is one of the more unique dining options on the West side, and the fact that's it's great food is an added benefit.


It's typically faster to call in an order because the wait can be ridiculous at times. They also offer delivery which I have not tried yet.  I hope they open some more locations along the I-17 or even downtown and uptown. I really can't fathom going back to Subway with Cheba and Silvermine around."}
{"text":"You know it's good management when they fuck up both ur sandwiches and you still leave happy! Great service,  wish more places responded so nicely!"}
{"text":"Came in to grab a bite to eat. Been here before but it's not close by so I had to stop by since I was close. The white widow is my favorite. Warm and scrumptious and the kool aid is a perfect way to wash it down."}
{"text":"Drove 20 minutes to get to Cheba Hut because my husband was excited to eat there. Got there and with no one else in the restaurant, waited over 20 minutes for sandwiches, despite there being 5 employees inside (the cashier ended up coming over and making our sandwiches). I ordered the Humboldt with extra pickles (which the cashier repeated back to me) and was disheartened to get my sandwich with one pickle and no cheese at all (important on a vegetarian sandwich). The rest of my party (of 4) was happy with their meat sandwiches, but next time they'll have to go without me :("}
{"text":"So dope! Cool vibes and DELICIOUS food at Cheba Hut, I recommend the Orange Widow sandwich if you're a lover of grilled chicken. There's so many delicious varieties of bread as well."}
{"text":"Me and my friends wanted to try this place because of the weed references. The staff were welcoming and asked us if we have been there before and provided our group with recommendations. I got the Kali Mist on garlic bread. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The culture and politics behind it aside, the food at Cheba Hut is great. The food is made fresh in front of you, and always tasting consistently great. I have been visiting this location for over a year now and have yet to be let down by the food or service. I highly recommend Cheba Hut. 

If you like sweet treats, try their unique rice Krispy treats made with different cereals. They are amazing."}
{"text":"I LOVE CHEBA HUT!!! Every time I come in here it's an amazing experience. The staff really puts customers first. The atmosphere is fun. The food is delicious. And the Gooballs are something to write home about."}
{"text":"I usually like this place. Good food, decent service. Today I changed it up and called in an order.  The guy on the phone was absolutely rude. When I got home,  the au jus was missing from my AK 47,  sort of the point of a french dip sandwich. 
Looks like I need to double check my take out orders."}
{"text":"My husband loves Cheba Hut whereas until recently I just thought it was okay. It's a sandwich place with a stoner/weed theme and okay, bro. 4/20 Blaze it, I get it. If I was new to marijuana, I'd had been stoked to find this place but I'm not new to this (I'm true to this) so I was kind of like, oh, this is different. I've never been to any place in New York that so openly celebrated getting high. The sandwiches are named after different strains of weed and even the sandwich sizes are weed oriented - nug, pinner, blunt. But, Cheba Hut is cute and funny so we went every so often. PLUS, I will say that they play great music. I've heard them play some Mos Def and Talib Kweli that I've only ever heard played in my car so that's an automatic win to me. Anyway, I've tried the Kush, the KGB, and the White Widow and each time they were good but not great until my most recent visit. My husband and I split a blunt sized White Widow, loaded up, with extra ranch and extra mayo. I also tried their red Kool-Aid and rice krispie bar - everything was so good. I think the issue was that I hadn't been getting my sandwiches loaded up. I was full from sandwich and just couldn't stop eating my rice krispie bar. It was like I had the munchies, lol. I'm not a big Kool-Aid drinker since usually people make it too sweet but this Kool-Aid tasted great, not too sweet at all but just sweet enough. It made me see why my husband loves Cheba Hut especially if his sandwiches always taste like that. I've since switched jobs so I'm not as close to Cheba but I know we'll back soon. Definitely try that White Widow with extra ranch, as per many of the other reviews; it's clearly a fan favorite."}
{"text":"This is my first review on yelp :) wanted to start making my opinion knowing on social media of the service industry. I absolutely love this place!  I have been coming here since I moved to az 6 or so years ago   And never been disappointed. There has been occasions that they have forgot something or gotten the sandwhich wrong which I never minded bc they were always super friendly and it still tastes great!
  The new system they have greatly improved their service.  Any error that was made in the past was bc of the communication from the register to the \"sandwhich artist\". But with this new system has less room for mistakes. So thanks for the up grade :). This visit  wasn't any different then past visits. Amazing service, amazing food! The only \"complaint\" or  I guess more of a suggestion is: they used to cut their cucumbers into small cubes. Which made a lovely blend of flavors in ever bite. They recently cut them in normal circles, not as conducive to getting the full flavor in your mouth. Lol. That is all. Thanks for the full belly cheba hut!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Cheba Hut!!! I have tried half their menu and have yet to be disappointed. You don't need to be stoned to love these subs! They are all kinds of awesome."}
{"text":"Cheba Hut will always be my favorite sandwich shop! Personally I think Jimmy Johns sucks and even though they're fast they do not come close to how good a toasted sub is at Cheba Hut!"}
{"text":"I went to Cheeba hut about a week ago for lunch.  I just completed a successful interview for a job at Honeywell in Phoenix.  I ordered a Jamaican Red Chicken sandwich.  It tasted average....like a buffalo chicken sauce.  It is nothing that I would rave about.  I have had better chicken sandwiches elsewhere.  I do not think that I will come back.  I can go elsewhere for lunch."}
{"text":"Man what happened to the bombtastic White Widow I remember back in the day? I had been craving Cheba Hut for a long time and while back in AZ I revisited the OG Cheba Hut from my high school days. Back in the day they had a gong (yes a real gong...well it was a mini gong, but a gong nonetheless) that you could ring on your way out to signify your happiness with you food and your visit. We would ring the shit out of that gong because the subs were so damn delicious. This time around it was a different story. They creamy spicy ranch dressing that use to accompany the White Widow has been replaced with a runny generic ranch dressing. :( The bacon looked like microwave bacon and was kinda rubbery. Has it always been this way? Have my taste buds changed that much? Does this change in my opinion have anything to do with my current level of soberness? Either way the goo ball made up for what the white widow lacked. I also wasn't thrilled with the fact that you don't follow your sandwich down the line anymore. I'll give the hut another chance but I must say I was disappointed this time around."}
{"text":"MARK!!! You are the man!!! Thank you SO much for giving us the greatest experience and service!!!!  I love stopping in for the outstanding service and the great drinks! You are the reason people come to Cheba Hut  I work next door and I am so happy to have a neighbor that keeps me coming back!! Thanks for everything!"}
{"text":"If you know anything about the smoker lifestyle, you will get a kick out of this place.

To start, the sizes of the sandwiches aren't simply listed in inches, but have a (strictly coincidental) name to identify them:
Nugs (4'), Pinners (8\"), Blunts (12\").

The entertaining names don't stop there; here are a few of the sandwich names:

Kush
Silver Haze
Afghani
Panama Red

This being our first visit, I went with the Afghani (thinly sliced spicy turkey breast, jalapeños & pepper jack cheese).  To mine I added black olives, lettuce, spicy mustard, and a little mayo; all on wheat bread (other options are garlic and white).  I got the Blunt, and it was more than enough to fill me up for what I feel was a reasonable price (under $10 if I remember correctly).

The bread and meat were very fresh.  The toppings were kept at according temps (olives cool, condiments just cooler than room temp, lettuce not soggy).  Overall a very pleasant experience.  Lastly, the first place I have been to in the Valley that gives me a chance to get a fountain Wild Cherry Pepsi.

The staff was friendly, entertaining \"stoner\" art (check out the Garden of Weeden mural), I would visit this place again."}
{"text":"The pot/stoner-themed decor (big fake joints, pictures of Bob Marley, etc) merchandise, the sizes (nugs 4', pinners 8', blunts 12') and sides (rice crispie treats with Fruity Pebbles, or the \"special\" brownies, Kool-Aid) add a fun atmosphere to a place that really should be known for good sandwiches on very good bread. 

In all the times I have gone here, I continue to order the same sandwich (Afghani) on wheat. This sandwich comes with thinly sliced turkey breast, jalapenos & pepper jack cheese. I add black olives and spicy mustard to mine. 

Staff has always been friendly, the place (while looking a little like the inside of a hippies van) never smells bad or looks dirty (beyond what people are dropping while still eating before the staff has a chance to clean up after them). 

If you want a (very good) sandwich at a reasonable price, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Best Subs around period."}
{"text":"Everything is good here, and Everybody goes here because the Subs are Awesome! crazy atmosphere with comfortable people to talk to. lots of laughs and fun here. mainly, the food, munchies , and drinks are just awesome and quick!"}
{"text":"i LOVE CHEBA HUT!  Beyond crave worthy.  Something about the garlic bread, pickles, and \"special herbs.\"  It is a really relaxed place, and I try to go as often as possible."}
{"text":"I guess this place is a stoner haven judging by the menu items and \"munchies\" they have (brownies, cookies, etc.)

I ordered the hummus which was actually very good!! It came with cucumbers, olives, and pita but I asked for more cucumbers instead. 

The decor looks like Bob Marley puked everywhere but I guess it's fitting for the type of place it is. 

The staff was really nice and efficient; didn't have to wait very long for the food at all. 

The ice machine and iced tea were out but that was quickly rectified once I told a staff member. I'd definitely eat here again. They have something for everyone."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches!! The Kali was amazing. All the veggies were fresh and the avocado really topped it off. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Look, the bartender was awesome (Victor) this place is a great little hideout!! Has a small covered patio good food and very cool ambiance. NOT a dive bar! Clean and kool"}
{"text":"So who knew it took the influence of marijuana to create a truly fantastic sandwich shop and bar?  

This place is awesome!  Went here for the first time today to grab some sandwiches for a business lunch and will absolutely be back.

They offer a ton of different sandwiches, three different sizes, three different hoagie rolls, and a ton of really great toppings.   Each sub is toasted and crazy delicious.   We tried three different signature subs and each one was great.

Located right next door to a Pot Shop, this place has a really relaxed and colorful vibe.  Super nice people behind the counter and making your food.  Wait time was minimal and the place has ample seating and is really clean.  They also have a full bar that shares itself with the indoor seating and outdoor seating in a gated patio area.   

In short, this is one of best independent sandwich shops I have seen in long time and has to one of the best, if not the best in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I went to Cheba Hut for lunch today.  I was incredibly impressed with the Pakalolo (ham, pineapple, swiss) and I got it loaded up with veggies to the max...it even includes a pickle inside the sandwich.  I was going to rate this place FOUR STARS until I thought about how amazingly clutch that pickle was hanging out inside my sandwich.  FIVE STARS!!!  I'm probably going again tomorrow."}
{"text":"I I love this place I came down here high as hell with my lady and my dog.bomb!! Come now !!!"}
{"text":"This place is a trip. I think i had the northern lights tuna salad. 
Cant really remember. It was good.... MmmMMM 

I like the names and sizes of all the sandwiches.
Chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"So it was cool to check this place out. I went alone since I had errands to run and had still not made a stop there.

It's tough to get in there if you're coming from the 101 towards 59th Ave. there is a lot of traffic and moves extremely slowly. So that was quite to pain to get around and in there. The area was quite creepy too.

Otherwise the place was kinda cool to check out. 

I ordered a pinner KGB minus the green pepper, on white bread. It wasn't busy when I arrived, so I was surprised it took 20 minutes for them to make a small toasted sandwich. It also came out on wheat bread instead. The toast was too toasted for my liking, I left with my mouth tore up from the bread. 

So again, it was alright. If you want a great sub, I would highly recommend firehouse subs. They are by far my fave and taste amazing! 

I really really wanted to love this place. I wish it were better."}
{"text":"Sometimes slow...but have to expect that with its \"chill\" environment.  The staff though is super friendly, and the subs are pretty delicious.  Everything is marijuana themed, but if you go to the store you can get a bit of free deserts, which you should buy anyway because they're delicious."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I love the white widow minus mushrooms. You can keep those! But so yummy with the pickles and ranch. My go to sandwich. Try it you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"As I'm typing this review out, I'm currently chugging down my Cherry Pepsi while slowly digesting my BLT sub.

So my friend took me here for lunch today and although the place wasn't exactly the kinda joint [hehehe...] that I'm use to, I became a fan instantly!

I had the 8\" BLT [Kush, I think?] and it was sooo delicious!  Every bite brought me to toasty euphoric bliss.

I definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"My friend and I placed a delivery order for 2 Kali Mist subs. Not only were they not toasted AT ALL, but they didn't put Avocado which is one of the main ingredients. We called in and received absolutely no apology from the cashier nor the manager. They said all they could do was send us new ones but we have limited time for our lunch and this wouldn't work for us. We explained that to the manager, however he did not care and stated that's the best they can do. Apparently that IS the best they can do as they were too lazy to toast and make our sandwich right the first time so they're also too lazy to provide better customer service. Cheba hut \"toasted subs\" guess not really."}
{"text":"please is the shizzle!!! not one bad sadwich on the menu all around fun place to bake then grub.  I recomend this place to everyone when I visit the AZ"}
{"text":"I came here, not sure what to expect. I really wanted a sandwich other than port of subs, and I'm so glad I found this place. They have a lot of selections of different kinds of subs, and they also have vegetarian options. The sub I had was so amazing, it had Brussel sprouts and so many flavors, and the prices are also perfect. They have a bar and they have ladies nights and some themed nights. I will definitely be back, and also go to check out their bar. They have a really nice vibe, and it's a nice place to hang out, and they also have outdoor seating with heaters."}
{"text":"Wow I have never realized how many homeless people are hanging around begging, yes I bought one a sandwich but I probably won't be back until they get it under control, there were 5 homeless people just sitting outside begging. No one wants to start the night with a \"hey man can I get a sandwich?\""}
{"text":"The dude that took our order was a fucking dick. I asked how the garlic bread was and he just put that as my order. And than I obviously didn't know that onions come on every sub and he goes \"it says it on the board\" ok asshole, I looked at your menu online I just look for what I want and you're gonna be dick? Ok. He talks to you with no personality AT ALL."}
{"text":"First timer today, was recommended by my Brother. I went with a coworker and the guy was super funny and very helpful. He gave us a \"newbie\" discount and chatted with us about what was on wash sub and so forth. I LOVED the Kali Mist. Not overwhelming on the spice was perfect. Each bite had a kick, not like subway where they give 4 jalapeños. Try their \"Pineapple Express\" tea, wasn't overly sweet but perfect. 

Will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"I have been here a ton of times and no matter what sandwich you get (white widow is my favorite) you HAVE GOT to get the pretzel bites. Even the pb&j is amazing. Oh and Kool-Aid and Tang on tap. You don't even have to be a weed head to love it"}
{"text":"at this point if you don't know about this place we must of been living underneath a rock... Or really high. 

 This place is the bomb. Come by and enjoy a delicious sandwich or beer. They have a wide variety of sandwiches with stoner themes that are to die for... They really are some of the most delicious sandwiches in the valley. Plus now they have their liquor license so they have hard alcohol and really good microbrews if that's your thing. My personal favorite is the Midwest best and I have them at sprouts and yellow mustard. 

Place is always busy and really clean and the staff is very friendly to say the least. 

I eat here 1 to 3 times every week. 

Highly suggested... 10 out of 10!!!! 

Open late on weekdays and weekends to accommodate the late night crowd."}
{"text":"Love Cheba, always friendly and the food is amazing! Try the pineapple beer with you pinned! Yum!"}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches! The establishment looks small from the outside, but once u walk in its nice and roomy. They have good old school rap music playing overhead. My husband and I got the BLT, mine was with Avocado and onion. Convenient bc they are open late, and I can't wait to see what the place looks like when they open up their bar!"}
{"text":"I just discovered this place a couple weeks ago and have gone 4 or 5 times since. I really like the food, they use some fresh ingredients.

There are multiple locations however. I first went to the one on University and had a great experience. The one on Southern however, for some reason, really seems to short you on ingredients. Twice now I ordered two sandwiches and paid extra to add the hemp cream cheese to them. Both times now they have barely put any on there but still charged me $1.00+ for the addition. They were both delivery orders or perhaps I could have said something when I got them. 

The part that really is frustrating, yesterday when I ordered the sandwiches, I said to the guy that last time it didn't look like there was much if any cream cheese on the sandwiches and asked if he could make sure it gets added.

The shop on University added a generous amount both times I have gone.

Otherwise I have no complaints. I will still give the other place on Southern a chance to redeem themselves... mainly because they deliver."}
{"text":"Want a good quality, tasty, very filling sandwich with shit loads of yummy options? Yeah go here. 

Seriously, don't even look elsewhere, there's a reason this place has great reviews. I've gone here many times and it's never disappointed. 

The decor and theme is very Rastafarian-stoner-world-peace-culture ish, but don't let that turn you away. Try this place!"}
{"text":"As always this place serves up the most delicious sangwhiches!!! I always get the white widow. This is one of my favorite places to get chow, the staff is always friendly and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"I've been to Cheba Hut too many times to count, and the sandwiches are always excellent, but I usually leave feeling annoyed at the slow service. My friend and I came here last night and got one 12\" sandwich to share and were waiting for 25 minutes when we finally decided to ask what the deal was. It turns out that they had already made the sandwich, but they had forgotten the ticket (?), so it had been put aside without a second thought. They apologized and proceeded to make a replacement for us only to mess it up yet again. On the third try, they finally got it, but we spent 40+ minutes waiting and were not offered anything to make up for it besides the first messed up sandwich that would have been thrown away anyway. One of the employees apologized, but it didn't seem very sincere. 

Anyway, great sandwiches, but I don't know if I'll return to this location after the experience that I had!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with Cheba Hut. I've only been in 5 times, but think about these sandwiches almost daily. My daughter is frequently at Cardons, and Cheba Hut takes away a little bit of our sadness. I haven't had a sandwich I didn't like yet. So far my faves are the AK47 and the Kali Mist. MMmmmm nom nom nom! I wish they delivered to East Mesa, but then again I'd probably go broke."}
{"text":"This place is it.

Aside from all of the hilarious weed related innuendo, Cheba Hut is the real deal. The best subs I've ever had.

Today my fiancé and I went to the climbing gym in Tempe and we came here right after and it hit the spot.

I will say though that this location specifically is way better than any of the other ones. I haven't visited the new one on 7th st. in Phoenix yet but, the whole experience at the University location is A1.

BB's Rating: BLUNTASTIC"}
{"text":"These guys are legit. Excellent variety of toasted sandwiches and great service. I had already bookmarked this place to try due to the great reviews. Then I got a flyer in the mail for a free nug (4-in sandwich) with purchase and a beer. So of course I took advantage and ordered the 5-0 and the white widow. The 5-0 was like an italian with various italian meats, and the white widow was a grilled chicken with bacon, mushroom, and signature ranch dressing. Both were excellent, but I liked the chicken better. Creamy, savory, perfectly cooked. And the free beer I chose was a flavorful craft IPA.
They really take their time building a great sandwich, so the bar is key while you wait. 
 
Perfect lunch spot. Nice people. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I simply don't understand how they make \"just a sandwich\" so amazing. I loved the environment, while enjoying 1/2 of my blunt, and left a believer."}
{"text":"sandwiches are good,but this place is filthy. Clean the tables hippies"}
{"text":"Want the best sub sandwich you can get?  Then head on down to Cheba Hut.  I've been here a bunch of times and every single time its great!  I pretty much just show up and pick a random new sandwich off the menu.  Not a single one has disappointed yet.  They also have salads as well.  Tonight was the first night that i tried one.  My wife had the antipasto salad and I had the southwest chicken salad.  They  were both pretty tasty.  They are large enough that they can easily be a meal on their own.

While the sandwiches here are amazing the little snacks and deserts they have our amazing.  They are some crazy sounding snacks but if you've ever had the munchies all the snacks on here will sounds AMAZING.  They have peanut butter brownies, fruity pebble bars, cinnamon crunch bars, and all kinds of other yummy stuff.  Trust me they are all super tasty.

Another great thing about this place is the fact that they have cool aid.  I don't know about you but I was definitely excited when I saw that.  They 
have also started delivering recently and this is great.

To recap, stop reading and looking on here and just head out and get a tasty sandwich.  Hurry, go get it!"}
{"text":"Favorite sandwich place hands down! I don't live in the area so I can't eat here all the time, but so far I've had the veggie sandwich with cream cheese twice which is SO good!!!  And the last time I went I ordered The Kind and took the suggestions of fully loaded with honey mustard, ugh... It was amazing!! I wish I lived closer so I could try one of everything!! Put a location in Seattle!!"}
{"text":"I forget the exact verbiage on the sign, but it roughly says that if they get your sandwich to you in under 5 minutes it's a miracle.  A point well heeded.  If you're in a rush, or don't like to wait forever to get your sandwich (seriously, how hard is it to make a sandwich), then you may want to go elsewhere (oddly there's a Jimmy Johns across the parking lot...you can probably get and eat your sandwich in less time).

Ok, now that I got that off my chest, what about the food.  Bread, good.  Veggies, good.  Pastrami like substance on my sandwich, not so good.

Overall, not bad.  Not sure I'd go back though."}
{"text":"I've been to 4 Cheba Hut locations, and this one is my favorite :) Although it's a little on the small side, I still love it.  The staff here is always friendly (like when I was in crutches and one of the guys opened the door for me, aww :)) and the atmosphere is always chill and laid back (of course, it IS Cheba Hut, lol).  My favorite sandwich has got to be the Chronic (Roast beef w/barbecue sauce, yuuuum).  When I went through my vegetarian phase I often feasted on the Magic Mushroom (teriyaki-portobello mushrooms), The Californian (a mixture of swiss, cheddar & pepper jack cheese), and The Griefo (Hemp cream-cheese with veggies...I even ate this one as an omnivore).  They also have the best rice-krispie treats (and Trix treats) and giant chocolate-chip cookies I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"So the Apollo 13 was amazing. Usually I get a white widow or red widow but the cashier recommended it and I have had it every day for the last week. I wake up with cravings for it. If you like Greek salads you will love the Apollo 13. Amazing. And the people are great here. Best sub place ever"}
{"text":"So, it's a sandwich shop.  It has a whole weed theme to it. HA-HA, yeah I get it.

This place does have some pro's working in it's favor.  Biggest compliment to this place...  They have kool-aid.  On tap.  No shit.  Let me repeat that.  kool-aid.  On tap.  Got it?  I had to rub my eye's in amazement and reflect on the pure genius of who ever approved that decision.  I can only imagine opening up the tap and letting it pour all over myself, bathing in it's elegance and beauty.  I assume this would violate a health code, so I will turn away from such behavior.  

Sandwiches are decent, nothing to write home to mom about, but better than your typical chain sandwich joints for a comparable price.  Won't win any awards but hasn't made me throw up.  I read a few reviews of people whining about the bread being harder than it should.  It is toasted, you know \"Like the typical customer\" (and the employees)  FYI, that will make the bread stiffen up some.  An elementary example of cause and effect.    

Takes a bit of time to get your food but it is even posted it takes a while to make a \"quality\" sandwich.  I disagree, but since they post it, the line has been drawn in the sand and their intentions are noted.  Fair enough.  If you don't want to wait, go somewhere else.

The annoying things about this place.  You order your sandwich in some sort of pot head size, joint, penner, or whatever the hell they are.  Being pretty ignorant about this terminology myself, I just order a \"medium\" sandwich and they are cool with that.  The staff seems like your typical grab bag of a pothead assortment.  All shapes and sizes are represented.  The traditional hippie, the dreadlocked bandanna wearing pissed at the world guy, the pot smoking girls with bloodshot eyes and the \"huh-huh\" laugh, and the scrawny young guy laughing and smiling at nothing amusing and/or funny, like Leonardo DiCaprio in the movie \"What's eating Gilbert Grape\"  I can't tell if they are high or just don't give a shit.  All right then.  I'm not here to judge, just to eat.

There is also a huge novelty joint hanging up in the store as well.  Not a lot of thought behind that, huh?  A bunch of tacky, goofy ass pot decorations and annoying associated artifacts are also always represented.  I suppose if I smoked weed this would be like eating at a museum or something.

The tables always seem dirty but I think everyone is too high to give a shit.  Plus it is always been busy when I have been in there so I'll go ahead and give them a pass on this.  

In all fairness, if this place was terrible I'd never come back, but I will.  Seems like I still grab lunch here every 2-3 months or so.  I'll still keep coming back, even if I have to deal with the whole weed thing.  Goddamn hippies."}
{"text":"I am sad to give this place only a few stars because the food is good but being it was my first time in here and there was a roach I gotta say I wasn't feeling that. This was sometime last year so maybe they have gotten an exterminator since then. Sandwiches-5/5, atmosphere-5/5, cleanliness 1/5 for the roach. The owner was good and gave us our money back plus some coupons but I don't think I will be returning to this location."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich places. The \"Skywalker\" is awesome it comes with salami, pepperoni, cream cheese and a bunch of other goodies. The \"griefo\" is a veggie sandwich, but one of the best veggie sandwiches you will even have. Plus the baked good are awesome too yum I always love a good brownie"}
{"text":"Being from the east coast and always looking for food in Vegas that reminds me of the amazing sub shops that I grew up eating... with that said Cheba Hut is on point. I ordered the Italian sub with garlic bread and it was GREAT!"}
{"text":"The best sandwiches in the Phoenix area. I love the atmosphere and the music they play here is awesome. Great beer choices as well except for the Rogue beer, too strong for me. I'll definitely come here repeatedly."}
{"text":"Love this place. The first time I walked in and ordered pretzels from the munchie area of the menu and they were delish. I like the concept of this place especially since I currently work in the Cannabis industry. I decided to order through grubhub since I was starved at work. I ordered the silver haze veggie nug size. One of the vendors from Evergreen Organix agreed and said she always gets it and it is great. I also decided to get the hummus platter. I just love hummus. I'm pregnant, so I decided to treat myself and add the pretzels again. I was able to used $10 off on grubhub since it was the first time I ordered (that was neat) the order came 10 mins earlier than scheduled. Everything was sooooooo good. I ordered the veggie sammie with no swiss (I don't eat cheese). It came with hummus, sprouts, cucumber, red onion, and I don't remember what else but OMG it was so good. The platter had fresh cucumber and the tomatoes were fresh also. The bread that came with the platter was also awesome. I'm a new fan of the place. Whoo Whoo cheeba hut."}
{"text":"The first time I had Cheba Hut, I really enjoyed it. This time, I had it delivered. They sounded busy and said it would take about 30-45 minutes. But arrived well after an hour and the food that was ordered hot was cold and chewy. There were also things missing. Disappointing. Guess next time I'll make sure they aren't busy if I want something delivered :/"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Cheba Hut- but I will preface this with the only sub I ever get is the AZ Homegrowwn chicken salad. Yes the decor is 100% stoner and they have red Kool-Aid in a dispenser. The restaurant itself is tiny which is a drawback and there seems to be a lack of decent AC in the place. The staff is super friendly (but that may be due to other substances besides the sandwiches).  The line at lunch snakes out the door so be prepared to wait or try to come during off hours. Otherwise enjoy the toasted sandwiches amde with a little extra TLC."}
{"text":"Soooo amazing , loved it , great bread and so fresh amazing , must try this place top 5 sandwich of my life"}
{"text":"I usually order the Afghani - spicy turkey.  I put everything on it and every minute of it is delicious. 

Worth mentioning is their ice tea.  Its brewed. Not that brisk/syrup and water bullshizz I've been seeing everywhere.  And its yummy! They usually have two types to choose from.  A black tea and a jasmine green tea (I think).

I always bring a book with me since its usually a bit of a wait (5-10mins), especially during lunch.  But I've never had  a meal there that didn't warrant that.

Bonus: the employees are nice and friendly and the people that frequent the spot are well mannered folk who at the very least, are entertaining to watch."}
