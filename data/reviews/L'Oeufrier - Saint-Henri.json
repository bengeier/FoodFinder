{"text":"I have been excited to check this place out since it opened up in my neighbourhood and today was the day! There were quite a few options on the menu, but I went with the 2 eggs with bacon, sausage, and banana and nutella crepe. I also chose half and half potatoes, and really liked the mashed potatoes - which I initially was skeptical yet curious about. I thought it was a bit expensive ($13), but the portions were huge!! Worth the price. Everything tasted great and I loved the choice of three different tabasco flavors just waiting on the table for me to use. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great chocolate waffle, great potatoes and bacon. Wait wasn't super long considering it was a Saturday morning. Some kid kept blocking the door though, and his dad wouldn't move him but I guess I can't blame the restaurant for that. Only criticism would be faster service to refill the water. 7/10 would try again."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch! Always looking for new places to have breakfast at on the weekend. Been to allo mon coco the last few brunches so decided to switch it up.   Was able to get a table right away but we went later around 1:45 on a Sunday.  Waitress was polite and nice. She was helpful with the menu, it's a big one with lots of choices. If I can suggest, the mason jar juices are quite good, orange and grape fruit was great.   Now, breakfast places are quite common now and the more elaborate dish you want the more expensive it will be. Standard breakfast starts in the $8 range plus tax plus juice. Personally breakfast is a great meal to splurge on and it's always satisfying where as supper is 3 times the price and can hit and miss a lot more often then eggs and bacon.  Order details:  Eggs, 3 meats, pancake, creton, baked beans and toast (massive and wasn't near being finished). Eggs, meats, waffle, toast and baked beans.   Everyone was good, I enjoyed the sausage and the pancake and waffles are good (the waffles I enjoyed more). Overall the ambience is hip and it's affordable depending on what your expecting. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent endroit pour un brunch.  Il y a énormément de choix, et les plats sont copieux. Le service y est très agréable."}
{"text":"I had the standard 2 eggs, sausage and bacon combo I have everywhere. Nothing different about it, which is fine. Reasonable pricing and open to family scenarios. Only thing I wasn't cool with was the small pieces of bread."}
{"text":"Deliciosos desayunos ademas son bastante variados, la atención fue genial, de verdad super recomendado"}
{"text":"This place is adorable. The decor is great, the service was fantastic and the food was SO GOOD! Big menu with lots of variety. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I went there with my friends & we were a big table. We didn't have to wait long and when we were joined by 2 others they gladly put more chairs for us. We had a great time and stayed for 2+ hours & they never pressured us to leave which was great, even though people were lining up at the door. The food was exquisite & the smoothies were divine. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Great place. Went there for breakfast, busy but the food is good and lot of options!"}
{"text":"This was a very good breakfast spot for a tourist. Food is delicious, i would recommend the duck confit eggs benedict. Staff is nice. However, the plates are huge, so you may want to share if you're not starving."}
{"text":"The place setup is okay. They have a big choice in their brunch menu : Eggs, pancakes, waffles, french toast, ..."}
{"text":"Went to this cafe with my friend for brunch. We had to wait 15 to 20 minutes as it was really busy. The waiters handed out smoothie samples to everyone so the wait wasn't too bad. We ordered eggs benedict and another egg dish to share. We also got smoothies cause we really liked the samples we tried while we were waiting. I got the strawberry kiwi one and it was amazing! The food was also very good. The cafe was cozy and had a nice vibe. Would definitely recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"There are many l'oeufrier locations around the city, so it's a nice place for crowded Sunday brunch!   They have the usual brunch fares on their menu. But my favorite is their patatis! It's basically omelette with melted cheese on top of potatoes. Yum! A plate of patatis is very filling, and they serve it with toast and fruits."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years , service and food is great especially for a breakfast place !"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is always a great time! Heavy bfast to soak up Saturday night's drinking fest. The place was DEFINITELY busy and I appreciated the fact that our waiter apologized numerous times for the long delay. The food was not bad at all. I usually stick to  a very simple bfast (eggs with potatoes) so it was half decent however the others at my table ordered the brunch poutine with 2 hotdogs and the breakfast mac & cheese. Truly, the disappointing plate was the Mac & cheese. It definitely needed more cheese but the brunch poutine was inhaled in about 3.2 seconds.... so it was pretty delish!"}
{"text":"Great spot! We had to wait in line for a bit - which is of no surprise on Canada day - but we kept getting tiny smoothies while waiting :) The food was great & although a part of our order never made it to our table (obviously a busy day) the service was otherwise good. I took Maryline en Amour which was HUMONGOUS! Enough to force feed 2 human beings, if not 3. Everything was amazing though, especially the banana & bacon waffle! Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Usually, I  not impressed with franchised restaurant. But, this place rocks. The staff is soooooo efficient and on point. Their menu is endless. Food is good, go with the classics. Size : humongous. Their white bread was ''butter to perfection'' said my toast professional/butter lover boyfriend. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"L'attention des serveurs et la rapidité du service demeurent constantes même lorsque le restaurant est plein, ce que je trouve agréablement performant. Toutefois, ça devient hyper bruyant et vous serez vraisemblablement assis au coude-à-coude avec vos voisins. Alors, puisque j'y vais habituellement avec mon amoureux et que je suis intéressée par ce qu'il me raconte, on s'arrange pour y aller tôt pour s'entendre parler ;) Je ne trouve pas l'endroit si spécial, le local a du charme mais les chaises sont droites, les tables petites (surtout vu la taille des assiettes) et il y a peu de décoration. On se concentre donc sur la bouffe...  Quelle bouffe justement!   Le menu est ridiculement exhaustif et les prix sont justes pour les plats. La première fois, le nom des articles sur le menu fait vaguement sourire (vous verrez), mais à la longue ce n'est pas si drôle de devoir les nommer pour les commander, d'autant plus que les noms n'ont pas nécessairement de lien avec les aliments pour s'en rappeler facilement. Mais à quelque part, ça aussi on s'en fiche, parce que lorsque les plats arrivent, ils sont super ! Chauds, généreux et aussi bien faits d'une fois à l'autre. Les fruits sont toujours frais, les garnitures sont abondantes, le café est resservi à répétition."}
{"text":"Great freshly made crispy potatoes, excellent beans, freshly squeezed orange juice, friendly service. Big portions. Tons of choice."}
{"text":"Un bon choix pour un brunch.  J'y suis allée deux fois et une fois en groupe de 7 personnes (sans réservation) et on a été tout de même vite servi. Le menu est vraiment très riche, il y a beaucoup de choix. Ça peut vraiment convenir à tous les goûts (sauf pour les intolérants au porc, il n'y a que du saumon ou du canard pour combler ce manque, dommage qu'il n'y est pas de poulet, de dinde ou encore du buf)   Il y a également des grilled-cheese et des poutines originales. J'ai choisi un smoothie \"qui part à Cuba\" (ou dans le même thème), c'était bon mais pas fou, ils sont fait de manière simple. J'ai commandé également une assiette de brunch composée d'une gaufre à la fraise et banane au nutella, d'oeufs, de pommes de terres et de bacon. C'était bon et complet, j'ai vraiment bien mangé et c'était à un prix abordable. Petit hic, le pain était juste un peu trop huileux..   La dernière fois, j'ai choisi de goûter le bagel au saumon, malheureusement les patates ont été cuites dans une vieille huile, elles avaient un mauvais arrière-goût ! C'est pour cela que je passe à trois étoiles au lieu de quatre.  Les serveurs sont tout de même très gentils, j'ai toujours passé un moment agréable et les prix sont très abordables. Alors cela reste un bon choix.  J'y retournerai :)"}
{"text":"Great aesthetic and atmosphere. Pleasant, fast service. The food gave sizeable portions that make you wish you could finish it all because everything was delicious. My new breakfast place!"}
