{"text":"Beautiful shop in a great location and parking, always a plus!  The chocolate was very good but not my favorite.  We might just be spoiled in Madison with a lot of delicious chocolate. I would interested in checking out the chocolate bar selection the next time I am in the area"}
{"text":"Great lattes.  Great chocolate.  Free samples.  Barn doors offering a view into the kitchen.  Super cute decor.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is such a gem of a store, a perfect addition to the neighborhood and the early stretch of Monroe St. The decor is lovely and thoughtful, the chocolates are absolutely delicious, and above all Megan and Vim are the sweetest!! Every detail is absolutely perfect. Don't miss out!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't consider myself a sweets person. Don't eat a lot of desserts, would rather have french fries over ice cream. But Madison Chocolate Company was a literal treat! The combination of top-notch Kin-Kin coffee and unique chocolate bars make for a great experience. 

The flour-less brownies are excellent. I also loved the Ritual chocolate bar I had. Madison Chocolate Company is a great place to buy unique (edible) gifts or treat yourself to rich flavors in small doses."}
{"text":"I've been in love with Megan's chocolate since first trying it at a CSA event at monona terrace several years ago. I loved it so much that we immediately joined, despite knowing we'd have to drive from Monroe during the week to pick it up. Megan is a wonderfully sweet and considerate woman who im so glad we had the pleasure to meet and We're super happy for her. We absolutely love the gooey liquid bourbon caramels, which are my fav, and my husband's fav are the ghost pepper caramels. Can't wait to get more!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and chocolate made in house. Watch Megan and crew make chocolates through a kitchen window. Better than the opening sequence of Willy Wonka. You can feel every detail of this place was considered in realizing the owners dreams.  Now stop reading this and go spend money.  This is the type of place you want to become a cornerstone of the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The words delightful, delicious, and distinguished don't even begin to describe the experience at Madison Chocolate Company. Megan Hile and Bridgette Dodge have done something extraordinary! When you walk in, there is an old schoolhouse feel to the shop, from the bookshelves (with chocolate and non-chocolate related reading material), to the bright interior, to the chocolate library, even down to the chairs I used to sit in as a child in grade school. The menus are etched into the mirrors, and the display case for the chocolate provides complete transparency with the amazing chocolates you can indulge in. At MCC, you can try one of the house chocolates or caramels made in their kitchen, or you can try any of the chocolates recommended by the owners and staff in the chocolate library. I got one of each and am still sampling my way through them. The liquid caramels are something from my warmest dreams. Coated in chocolate, as you bite into the treat, caramel oozes out filling your mouth with a sweet, rich treat. Alongside the chocolates and caramel, you can also order coffee beverages, or hot chocolate. Keeping in line with their philosophy of staying as local as possible, KinKin coffee is used at the shop. I have already enjoyed so much from MCC, and can't wait to see what else Megan and Bridgette have in store for us!!! Congratulations on the brick and mortar store. This is a must-go in Madison!!!!"}
{"text":"Cute new shop.   Outstanding chocolates.  Owner has deep knowledge of chocolate having worked in industry as a consultant -- a true bean to bar expert and very well networked to other chocolatiers!   Chocolates are amazing.  We all should support anyone who pursues their passion and does so in such an excellent way!   Will be back.   Love this place!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal shop with equally delightful offerings.  Cannot say enough kind things about the chocolatier.  Please support this place, Madison!  The ghost pepper caramels are to die for."}
{"text":"I got the London chew. Too sweet and unrefined, and the coconut curry part really tasted like curry (not in a good way). Definitely try something else. On the plus side the interior is cute and the cashier is nice and very friendly."}
{"text":"These chocolates are the REAL DEAL. I'm a chocolate lover but a bit of a miser, so I'm always skeptical of pricy chocolate, but it was love at first bite with Madison Chocolate Company. The ghost pepper and bourbon caramels are delectable and by far my favorites. I've also been consistently pleased with the truffles, especially with more unusual flavors like bergamot and delightful combinations like blueberry basil. More recently, I tried the berry bark and really had to exercise some self control not to eat an entire bag in one sitting. Food aside, Megan is a gem of a human being who welcomes everyone as she would family. Beyond that, the space is beautiful, meticulously designed and executed. A must for chocolate lovers."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I love their wall of chocolate bars from other independent companies. It's a great way to discover what other chocolate makers are doing out there. We ordered their chocolate ganache and their spicy hot chocolate. The chocolate ganache is a thick European hot chocolate served with a side of cream. It differs from hot chocolate in that it's much thicker. It's made with single origin chocolate, and when we came, they were using a 55% Hawaiian chocolate. Hawaiian chocolate is light and fruity and so was this chocolate. My impression is that they switch up the single origin chocolate they use so I'm eager to come back and try more. 

The spicy hot chocolate had just a hint of spiciness for me (but I tend to have a palate that is very tolerable to spice, so others may find it spicier than I did). But it was delicious. This is how hot chocolate should be - heavy in chocolate, low on sugar. When I want hot chocolate, Madison Chocolate Company serves up the kind of hot chocolate I'm often hoping to get. Now I know where to go for my hot chocolate fixes."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! We tried a coconut convert, two different sea salt caramels and a couple different barks. Divine! The owner was delightful (dare I say sweet?). Highly recommend this new establishment."}
{"text":"A great selection of housemade chocolates/truffles/desserts to go along with a well curated selection of chocolates made by other chocolatiers.    Friendly staff and in my opinion, the best caramel latte in town.  They make the caramel syrup in house and its phenomenal.  Definitely rich but who doesn't like to indulge every now and then.  Parking can be tricky at times but it is well worth a visit to check it out."}
{"text":"Delicious chocolates, wonderful coffee, beautiful space and amazing staff. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"This place is not just another chocolate shop. It's different. And I love it. 

I remember screaming in the car with excitement as we drove past it when I saw a sign saying they sell Jeni's ice cream. My favorite ice cream in the world. So to be honest this was actually what got my foot in the door, ice cream rather than chocolate.

But then...I saw the chocolate. They got some unique flavors. I tried some chocolates my favorite. the ghost pepper, which is not horribly spicy but a wonderful, interesting flavor trip for your mouth and mind. 

We also got some drinking chocolate which was just that...basically just drinking melted chocolate , thicker than hot cocoa, it was divine. 

Now they also have chocolate bars from all over the world that I've never see before. So cool! Even high end fine grocers don't even have the chocolates that I've seen here. Very unique, and I would think a great place to shop for a present for a chocolate lover."}
{"text":"Decent little chocolate shop across the street from the arboretum and Lake Wingra. The single source sipping chocolate was delightful and came served with little side of whipped cream. The sipping chocolate was thick and rich with a nice texture. Companion sampled the spiced hot chocolate which she thoroughly enjoyed.   

They also have some interesting house made chocolates. I wasn't a fan of of the curry coconut chocolate, despite my love of current. This said the Ghost Chili Truffle - Shazam... you really need to just order one and give it a shot

Note there is parking in the back of the building which can be a big plus in this neighbor."}
{"text":"So many good things about this shop. The space itself is gorgeous, so many bold and playful colors - it's like visual heaven, especially during the winter. Everyone there is very friendly. And, of course, the chocolates are delicious. My favorites are the ghost pepper caramels and the peek-a-boos. Definitely one of my favorite spots in Madison!"}
{"text":"A terrific addition to the Madison Chocolate community! Megan Hile's love of chocolate and her exquisite palate are on full display at this Monroe Street gem.

Make sure to try the Ghost Pepper Caramel Latte if it is available when you visit. As good as the Ghost Pepper Caramels are, the creamy, warming drink hits all your senses and stays with you for some time after finishing it. 

The chocolate library, featuring amazing chocolates from all the place is amazing and reads like a wine list. 

A dream come true for Madison chocolate lovers!"}
{"text":"I finally made it in here, and I'm sure glad I did! I will admit that when they first opened I was torn between \"what, another chocolate place in Madison?\" And \"sweet, another chocolate place in Madison!\" But then I tried the truffles and oh my good goodness, yes please, can I have more? The Coconut Convert is oh so good, and the Blood Orange truffle literally melts in your mouth. I can't wait to try more! I have heard the the espresso drinks are delicious, and I'll certainly be back soon to try them. 

They've got a very cute shop, great location with a few parking spots to call their own behind the building. Friendly and knowledgeable service. I was there on a Saturday evening, and there was a bit of a line at the counter the entire time I was there. 

Only dislike (and I know it's a personal thing): way too many caramel things. I'd love to try a ghost pepper truffle if it didn't have caramel. For the first time in my life, I stood in front of a display case of chocolates and had difficulty picking out two things I would like. Not difficulty narrowing it down, difficulty finding two things I would enjoy. (Yes, I know two of one thing is an option). (And yes, I know how I sound). Luckily, a new option presented itself at the last second and saved the day. 

I love all the wonderful chocolate options we have, and will continue to visit them all; Madison Chocolate Co will definitely on the list"}
{"text":"I went to their grand(?) opening on Saturday and got to see their new space! The shop is very cozy (read: small) but the interior design is gorgeous. The chocolates they offer are equally luxurious. They had samples of their hot chocolate and a few flavors of their chocolate bark (rose, raspberry?, and coffee). They also are a coffee shop serving single origin coffees. In addition to their own chocolates, they sell chocolate from other fancy brands."}
{"text":"We walked by and had to go in. Coffee and chocolate.. tyvm. We had a sample and we were hooked. A London bar and key lime ice cream quickly came home with us. The london bar is to die for.. the ice cream we haven't tried yet but I'm sure is just as amazing. The staff was all adorable and the late art we saw as we walked by was just as cute as they were. If you see this palce.. stop in. It's pretty adorable."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time this morning and they swept me off my feet! 

It has a relaxed, quaint atmosphere with good light and maybe 6-8 tables? Seems right sized for this area. There is a window where you can watch chocolates being made in the back.

The front of the house manager was happy to walk me through their menu. She made me feel so welcome! And they had house-made chocolate samples at the counter. Sold! A $10 box of four (bourbon butter, liquid salted caramel, raspberry cardamom and blood orange) went to work with me and they got rave reviews. 

The drink menu was really interesting. They have espresso, chocolate and lots of specialty hot tea drinks made with their own flavorings. Of course you can also get a regular cup of coffee and tea, too. I tried the Ghost Pepper Caramel Latte, light on the flavoring (I said I didn't want it too sweet). It was outstanding. 

Lots of craft brands of chocolate bars to buy (20 or more?), and other fun gifts. They also had a few more perishable house treats (cherry handpies, brownies). On the weekends they advertised a waffle day and pies. 

Definitely a great place to make a special trip with friends, or swing by for a cup of coffee in the morning *andchocolates*. 

I'll be back! Such a thoughtful approach to the neighborhood confectionery and coffee shop. Convenient parking is in the rear of the building."}
{"text":"Megan Hile is a beautiful genius who pours her zest & passion for life into all that she does. She is truly a gift to this world & her chocolates are, too! You cannot go wrong with any assorted truffle, caramel or chocolate bark. The chocolate library features chocolate bars from around the world - artisans that Megan knows personally! Run don't walk to this gem of a shop in the Monroe St area!!"}
{"text":"Updating my review to a 5. I come her often for their lattes and also the chocolate. I think that their caramels are the best. The butter burboun is by far my favorite. Still a little pricey but worth is for 1 or 2 truffles every once in a while. My son also devoured a GF molasses cookie, so we got another togo. 

One thing though that makes this place a 5 star and beyond is not only their delicious coffee and chocolate but the service is outstanding. 
For Christmas I really wanted a dark chocolate Christmas tree for my son who has dairy allergies. They had them in stocked weeks before Christmas but I didn't want to buy it too early. They assured me they would have some closer to Christmas time. I called one evening and they said they would have some the next day. I went in and there were none to be found, an honest mistake but we all know the high stress the holidays can bring. I think I had been running around all day with a baby in tow and I think the staff could sense my frustration. The staff person then proceeded to call the owner and ask if/when they'd be making more. She said she'd have some made by the next day. I came in the next afternoon and the chocolate trees were ready, I was also able to thank and talk with the owner! I was so impressed with their overall customer service and will be coming back for that alone."}
