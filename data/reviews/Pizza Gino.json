{"text":"Paid 30$ for a cold pizza when it showed up 1 hour an a half later. Really terrible customer service."}
{"text":"I just tried to order two medium pizzas from this place.  The guy made it so complicated it was impossible to understand then in the end, he wouldn't make 2 split dressing pizzas.  What a waste of time.   I think I'm going to stick with 4 saisons."}
{"text":"Very fast service!!!! If you want a quick bite and a decent pizza this is the place. Ordered the all dressed was good. Fresh toppings and good amount of pepperoni.crust is alright & edible."}
{"text":"Ok that last review is awful, however... I will tell you the truth about this Pizza. I do a lot of traveling for my job which bring me to both Canada and the US, I've literally been in every state except Alaska and Hawaii. 

Anyway, who doesn't love Pizza???
I buy pizza everywhere I go and I have to tell you, this is my favorite pizza place and I also ordered the poutine as well and I will be back! Delicious!!"}
