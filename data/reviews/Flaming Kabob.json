{"text":"I ordered a meal online for delivery and the food didn't arrive until 2 hours later (I live 4 minutes down the road). When the food Did come, it was cold. The only good thing was the energy beet juice I ordered. Pretty good stuff."}
{"text":"The food here is simply disappointing, and leaves you feeling gross after you've eaten it.  It all tastes very processed, not fresh.  It may be inexpensive, but clearly you get what you paid for (or less)."}
{"text":"I like their food!! I have tried the LAMB SHANK and it was so goooood!! I would definitely go to Flaming Kabob again. Thanks to Ahmed"}
{"text":"I go here once a week at least! Place is good.. the gyro special is always good. For a healthier option I get the gyro salad which is just as good! Try this place!"}
{"text":"The food is reasonably priced and the staff is personable. The $1 upgrade for the Greek side salad was definitely worth it - large portiom of bright greens with lots of cucumber, feta, and kalmata olives. (Watch out for the pits!) We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I love \"Mediterranean\" food and thought I'd try this place.  I was craving lentil soup...so let me be brief.  Worst lentil soup I've ever put in my mouth.  No flavor.  It had been simmered to the point of mush.  Just a bowl of mush.  If I want a bowl of mush I'll read \"Goodnight Moon\".  GAWD.   I ordered chicken shwarma.  What a joke.  Dry flavorless grilled chicken on a stale pita garnished with one piece of pathetic lettuce and a slice of onion.  Garlic sauce  (sorry, forget the name) was very strong.  After eating it I just tasted garlic.   Terrible service.  The old diner turned greek is lame.  Save your dollars, dignity, and time by avoiding this place."}
{"text":"I love this place so much, been here a couple times the past months. The food is amazing and the customer service is great. Every time I've been here it was an awesome experience"}
{"text":"Great shawarma and great staff!! However, the number of the staff is low so you will to wait for minutes, but worth it!"}
{"text":"placed a take out order (2 gyro ''sandwiches'', chicken shwarma, hummus and some baklava)...got there to pick it up and it seemed like if there's more than 2 people eating there, the whole staff gets flustered and doesn't know what's going on.  Sat there waiting for 15 minutes (even though my order was done and waiting) until they took care of the eat-in diners.  Long story short: crappy service BUT awesome food.  The gyros were stuffed to the max, the chicken was cooked perfectly, the hummus was bomb, and the baklava was a great ending.  I'll definitely go back, but it will always be a take-out scenario, because again, the service seemed to suck."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is a go to favorite of mine. I have always had good meals and anytime I have a friend meet me here, they become a fan as well. The Fattoush salad is absolutely amazing and it is hard for me to have anything else other than that item. I also love the fact that the manager/owner typically always stops by to ask how everything was and if there is anything he can do. It is always great to witness customer service at its best."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here a number of times and the food has always been wonderful. The service is great as well and the pricing is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Apparently this place likes to include their own tip if there's 3 people or more and they tax it also. Who does that? I ask the waiter why did they included the tip and he said is the rules of the restaurants. I kept asking why and still couldn't give me an answer, but he never called the owner over. So I pay less than what was asked and left him a written tip on the receipt."}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff is always really friendly. I lost my credit card one day and instead of getting mad they let me have lunch instead. So whenever I go back I give a big tip. The owner/manager always talks to us and we have hung around just talking to him for a long time.   The food is awesome. Some of the best hummus I've had and the gyro is so good I rarely try anything else.   The one draw back is the bathroom is not really a customer friendly place."}
{"text":"Awesome! Don't miss this restaurant.  The food is exceptional; the hummus is the best I've had outside of the middle east. The meat is always fresh and well cooked. If you're on a date, the two person mixed meat combo is a good choice to see what you like. If you're into Greek, their Gyros are always done perfectly, and their tzatziki is on point.  Prices are fair for dinner, low for lunch. I stop by at least once a week for the $6 gyro, fries, and drink combo.   They are a family run business, and every interaction I've had with the owner has been great. He really cares about the quality of his food and how his customers feel.  Yes, the decor is off. They obviously bought a defunct 5 'n Diner and turned it into the Flaming Kabob. It makes no difference to me, I'm sure in time they will redecorate or relocate. Either way, I'll be there."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!!!  Awesome service from the waiter.  The food is delicious and always fresh.  The decor isn't top notch.  Restaurant is always clean the times we been there.  Then again we don't go there for the decor."}
{"text":"We were here the first time ... Incredible food and lots of it .. We enjoyed it and I think we are going to have left overs would last another five meals"}
{"text":"I'm so confused by the reviews posted. I checked into Yelp before our dining experience and was excited to find a yummy Mediterranean place near my house. However, my experience was .... awful. We have driven by this place for a while and finally decided to chck it out. When we arrived we were the only diners.It was 7:30 at night, and in July in Mesa we know it's hot... rediculous that the interior was equally as hot. They had all the ceiling fans on.. but not the air conditioner. I almost left just based on the temperature but decided to stick it out. There were dirty tables all around us, we were asked to seat ourselves and did so at one of the only clean tables. It took 10 minutes before we were even waited on. Again, I almost left, but wanted to try the food! When the food came I was disapointed to say the least. Fries were oily and soggy, my salad was warm, my gyro meat was cold. The best part of our meal was the soda. My son ordered a cheeseburger and fries and his meal was the best of all of ours. We were not offered any further assistance from the wait staff after our food was served. Our server's child was there and she was sitting with her family talking on the other side of the resturaunt. All in all.... I will not return nor will I refer anyone. Maybe we just visited on an \"off\" day.. but regardless.. ain't nobody got time."}
{"text":"First time at Flaming Kabob, Ahkmed provided amazing service,  the food was delicious, we will for sure be back. Thank you for a great dinner and experience"}
{"text":"How come it isn't in Trip Advisor? Excellent shawarma, and, surprise, the \"flan\", a southamerican desert, is the best in the valley.  Great service, lovely super fresh, just made, food."}
{"text":"My sis recommend this place for our weekly dinner. We shared on of the large appetizer platters (hummus, baba ganoush, tabouli and dolmades and two pitas). Very good and perfect for a light dinner. I would have to say the best thing was the fresh lemonade...wow! If you like tart you'll love this.   I thought overall the service was great. Not only was our waitress extremely attentive but the manager stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our food  I give The Flaming Kabob 3 stars!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place when we are craving something fresh, healthy, filling, and soo yummy. We like to order the Flaming Kabab combo for two and it's a great sampler of all their delicious meats. Their hummus is so incredible I could eat it with a spoon. The owner/cook came out and talked to us he is very kind and he really cared about our dining experience."}
{"text":"I ordered the food. When I got there my grubhub sheet that they printed hadn't even been given to the chef. (Which was a ten minute drive to get there)  then the garlic sauce was still in the box, even though I asked for none and the hummus that I asked for as a side was a very small spread spoonful, maybe a tad more. Instead of simply providing a bit more especially since I paid extra for a Greek salad but just asked for hummus instead, I had to purchase more for $5. Not gonna make it back flaming kabob. There is a nice Mediterranean/Middle Eastern joint to eat at just around the corner."}
{"text":"So, I order delivery from here about once a month. Order arrives pretty consistently and is always delicious. Tonight they accidentally delivered me the wrong food (first time this has ever happened), and when I called about it they rushed the correct order out at no charge, let me keep the incorrect order, and issued a $6 partial refund. All I can say is that was an unexpectedly pleasant experience, and I'll continue being a customer because of it.   This one blip aside, their food is consistently good, large portions, and on-time delivery. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"The gyros are okay, just okay.  Way overpriced but real quick on deliveries which is a plus."}
{"text":"Great service, wonderful atmosphere the food was beyond amazing the staff was super friendly! I ordered the combo for two I thought I was going to get some small sampler plate boy was I wrong it was enough to feed a family my favorite part was the beef kabob it was cooked to perfection and all seasoning and spices were on point I will definitely tell all my friends!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for wonderful Mediterranean food, this is the perfect place to stop. I've lived in the area my whole life and can remember the Diner that was there first (so to the person that commented on their look, that's what it's from).  My best friend and I consider this our place. When we meet for a meal, it's usually there. The staff is very friendly and know us as soon as we walk in. The service is quick and we have never had a problem with the taste/temperature/size/ect. of the food.  Favorite menu items: Hummus (two girls splitting the large is usually our way to go). Chicken Lemon Rice Soup (I stock up when I'm sick). Chicken Shawarma (one of the best places I've had it in the state).   I urge you to try the food if it's your type of restaurant, and if it's not, I recommend it anyway to step outside your comfort zone."}
{"text":"I am going to have to disagree with the review below. I was here over the weekend and I thought the food and the service was excellent.     The waitress was very attentive to our needs. The manager/owner was very hospitable and checked in to make sure that everything was ok. I ordered a mixed meat platter that was ridiculously good.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Homemade from scratch, the BEST! I wanna lick my plate everytime"}
{"text":"We've only been in PHX a few years and my wife and I really love Mediterranean style food. We've tried a few places around town and have been looking for a place in East Valley that has good Med food at reasonable prices. You can tell this family bought an old chromed out diner restaurant. Doesn't look Middle Eastern in the least but the food was good. $5 for a Chicken Shawarma? Nice!. And a big plate of delicious rice for only about $6. I took my wife and 2 college age boys there and we enjoyed it.  The tables didn't look real clean though and that was a bit of a turn-off. That's something they need to focus on. But our utensils seemed clean and of course our sandwiches were mostly eaten right from the wrapper. Hopefully they'll make some cosmetic adjustments.  We'll be back again."}
{"text":"The food was fine . I went to this restaurant several times but last time Was very bad because the server does not know how to deal good with costumers"}
{"text":"This place is by far the best middle eastern restaurant in the valley. The rice is excellent and I think the selection of kabobs and meat dishes by far the best that I have had in arizona"}
{"text":"I had the Flaming Kabob cater my large party of 160 people.  The food was fantastic!!! They were prompt, so helpful and again the food was absolutely delicious! I would definitely use them again and would high recommend to use their wonderful services.  The pricing was the best I found and again did I mention how great the food was?!?!? Such nice people too.  Thanks again for the great food and service!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Eating there isn't the greatest, customer service isn't always great, but the food is amazing! From kabobs to falafels, you can't go wrong. We like to order the combo for two, which is really more appropriate for 3-4 people and it's cheap too. They give you SOOOO much food for what you pay when you get the combo. The chicken kabobs are another favorite of mine. The meal comes with yellow rice too & I love me some yellow rice! The delivery driver is super nice and they deliver late. Try it out!"}
{"text":"I did not care for the service or food.  The babageneish did not taste right to me,  they ran out of grape leaves, after I  ordered a shawarma they came back and said they had none. My wife liked her Greek salad, it was big.  She ordered something with lamb but they had none of that either.  I ended up getting a kabob gyro but 2 of the chunks of meat in it were too tough to cut much less try to bite. The best part was getting the check so we could leave."}
{"text":"The flavor and quality of the kabobs were good and tasted like good quality meat but the price was much too high. I am sad as I was hoping to find another go to for a quick family dinner. However, one plate with a side of falafel was $30 and would only (barely) feed one adult and one kid. They do give a lot of rice and pita bread and probably some could fill up on that but I don't like filling up on carbs so I left a little hungry."}
{"text":"The best Lebanese food i've found in Tempe. The staff is mediocre at best, but the owner is so nice and always willing to talk and share stories with costumers."}
{"text":"Let me preface that Mediterranean cuisine is my favorite cuisine so I am super picky. I love this place. The tabule salad is extraordinarily fresh, the rice is to-die-for and the meat is always juicy and delicious. The prices are reasonable. Totally recommend it to anyone that is into Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"An hour and a half after ordering, we are still waiting for our food. Called 20 mins ago and they knew exactly what I was waiting for, meaning they couldn't possible be that busy.  Disappointing for first timers.  EDIT: After finally receiving our food, I can say that we weren't disappointed with the food at all!! We ordered the Combo for Two and holy mackerel was it a ton of food! We have enough for lunch and dinner! The grape leaves could have used more flavor.   Still only 3 stars just for the simple fact that we were not allotted any time to actually enjoy our food before we were off to work. Would definitely order from here again and give it another chance!"}
{"text":"This review is limited because I've only had takeout. However, I have had a lot of takeout from here because it is so close to home and so good. My favorites are the pita sandwiches (they are all good), the hummus, and the lemon garlic chicken. My only complaint is the way they package the takeout. There's not anything wrong with it per se, but if they invested in something a little better than foil paper and styrofoam, it would go a long way in improving the take out experience."}
{"text":"Very good food! My fiance and I got the dinner for two. Could have easily fed 4 ppl. The rice with golden raisins was delicious. The various meats were good too. Came with chicken and lamb kabobs, sliced chicken, falafel, and ground meat. Very well seasoned! Came with a giant portion of hummus and a green salad. Was not a fan of the oil/dressing for the salad, but everything else was delicious! Not greasy either!"}
{"text":"Simply the best Middle Eastern restaurant that we know. This evening we drove from Surprise to Mesa to enjoy their delicious fare. The building is an old 5 & Diner. The walls are bright but sparse. The tables and floors are very well kept. We ordered the Family Feast and received more than six could eat. The Fattoush is wonderful as well as the hummus and pita to start. Then the meats arrived! Perfectly spiced and prepared.  The service was attentive. We enjoyed our meal immensely. My one concern is the ladies room. There isn't a light above one stall. There is an odor.  Overall I think this restaurant has a lot to offer. It could use some decor, and a facelift for the bathroom."}
{"text":"The 50's diner decor is a little weird, but the service is good and the food is a good value and tasty."}
{"text":"We randomly stopped here on our way home tonight and we are so glad we did. This is a family owned restaurant and the service was fantastic!! We just did a carry-out order on some gyro and fries (that were so delicious!!) and when our food came we were sad we didn't have time to sit and chat longer! We will definitely be going back and will probably bring the whole family next time!"}
{"text":"Ate here last August, 2012. Deeeelicious!!!! But the restaurant itself is a little gross. I think it used to be a 5 N Diner- so all the booths, window sills, etc are greasy and disgusting. Place just needs to clean up. But the hummus was fantabulous!! Yummy pita bread. Kabobs were delish too. Would eat it again... but probably get takeout ;)"}
{"text":"I was in Gilbert and felt like kabobs.  The last thing I wanted to do was cook tonight.  I haven't been to the Flaming Kabob in a while.  However, I'm so glad I stopped in the food is great!  I ordered the beef kabobs they were great and the rice was outstanding.  If your in Gilbert you have to try Flaming Kabob, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The chicken kabob plate is perfecto. Moist chicken, and excellent rice (with succulent golden raisins). I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I will also have to agree with imran.  I can't let this place get a bad wrap for one unsatisfactory review.  This is by far my favorite middle eastern food in the valley.  I grew up on authentic arabic food and the flaming kabob tastes just as great as the food I remember eating growing up.  Their grape leaves (w/ lamb) are fantastic, love the hummus, garlic sauce is very potent and wonderful, the gyro plate as well as the chicken shwarma are A++.  And the filafel and tabouli are perfect.  I have turned many friends/acquaintances on to this restaurant and most of them are hooked too.  Definately give this place a try.  You wouldn't be disapointed."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. I crave their food while I am at work!  The food is so fresh all the time and their meats are grilled to perfection!  I have also recently been trying to lose the weight I have put on since starting college and this place helps me out because of their great variety of salads and they are all super delicious. My favorite is the Greek salad with grilled chicken breast over it , or I get the Tabbouli or Fattoush..or the Khalil Salad, it is all so wonderful! They have great vegetarian options too, their hummus, falafel, and stuffed vegetarian grape leaves are so so good and filled with flavor. The portions are huge and very affordable, I get lunch and have half of it left over for dinner!  Also, their staff is very attentive and helpful. Everything is clean and fresh. The owner us a very nice man, he comes around and asks you how you like everything! (Definitely makes me feel like a special customer!). I have also been to their Tempe location which is equally great!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant about four times.  I like it.  The food makes me miss living in Metro Detroit.    Hits:  The fattoush salad is the best I've had in Arizona.  The hommous is a big hit with me and my friends.  Garlic sauce is perfect.  The price is just right for the quality of food and the amount served.  Take out is quick.  The workers are very nice.  Misses:  The temp in the restaurant tends to be a bit too warm.  The restaurant looks like it was one of those 60 style restaurants with the little radios at each booth and none of the decor was changed when the new restaurant took over.  The dinning area is a bit dirty.  It could benefit from a deep cleaning to make dinning in a little bit more comfortable.  I wouldn't want to go there on date.  The homemade desserts are missing.  Overall, I'll keep enjoying the fattoush and will soon try another location.  Give this place a try."}
{"text":"I have been to both locations now, and the falafel is excellent at both. I'm not a meat eater, but my boyfriend likes the shwarma, too. I LOVE the rice!!!  The owner is very friendly and always up for political banter. All in all, a good spot. Its not Haji Baba, but it's still pretty good.  The Mesa location is a little retro diner which doesn't quite fit the food they're serving"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mediterranean food around. Always have good service, large portions, decent prices and the food is amazing. Recommend grape leaves, hummus, gyros, and fatoosh. They do need to clean up the place as the building needs to be renovated and updated with decor with a good scrubbing, but don't let this fool you in how amazing the food is."}
{"text":"I walked in and ordered food to go at lunch.  VERY slow and there was NO ONE in here at all.  I thought the inside was shabby and dirty.  The food was not bad but due to concerns with appearance i would never go back here again.  Must survive mainly on middle eastern clientele."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here twice before. I really REALLY love the falafel. It's just the right amount of spicy and I could eat it all day. The hamburger was also good! The reason it is only four start is because the grilled chicken sandwich thing was just not flavorful."}
{"text":"From the Greek salad to the Shish kabob they have excellent food and the pricing I am at this place at least 3 days a week for lunch"}
{"text":"Food is always good!! The only reason I only gave them 4 stars is because of  the service 99 percent of the Time sucks ...I usually have to go ASK for more soda or I have to go ASK for the check or whatever I need because they don't seem to care much about customer service ....  Side note Being going there for over 2 years one of the restroom lights was burn out so it was kind of dark in there and I swear it took them more than a year before they got it replace ...."}
{"text":"Flaming Kabob, disguised as a former 5 & Diner, has been open at this location for a little over two years. Why, then, hasn't anyone reviewed it?   The staff was nice enough. The place was nearly empty at 1 pm on a Wednesday, yet service was remarkably slow. There were only two staff members in the front, but there were also only two other tables occupied while we were there.   I admit, after being spoiled with the wonderful Mediterranean cuisine of Fattoush, this place left me disappointed and yearning for my favorite little hole in the wall joint. There were seven of us, so we got to sample an array of what Flaming Kabob has to offer. Here's a run down:   Hits:  The Tabbouleh salad was tasty.  The rice, with golden raisins, was very moist and flavorful.  Chicken kabob was spot on.  The garlic sauce was good, but not as smooth as i've had other places.  Tasty iced tea. (garden variety)   Misses:  Baba ghanoush lacked flavor. Consistency was good.  Hummus could use more spice.  Falafel was overdone, almost to the point of being charred, yet soggy in the middle.  Spinach pie (spanakopita) was awful. Ricotta cheese and some odd spice that we couldn't name ruined this dish.  Chicken kofta was an odd texture. It's ground chicken, but there's something else about it.... Pitas came straight from a bag. Come on guys, can't you do any better?   And completely unrelated to the food.....the bathroom was out of toilet paper. Or seat covers. Or anything resembling a paper product that one might use after relieving themselves.   Final verdict: Don't waste your time or money. The prices are higher than many similar places- $8-9 for a lunch plate, the service is really slow, and it just isn't that good."}
{"text":"This place has some really delicious gyros. I do NOT like lamb, but their lamb/beef sliced gyro meat is absolutely delicious. Got one regular gyro and one falafel gyro. The falafel was nicely seasoned with strong cumin flavor. Glad I ordered extra tzatziki sauce. Some fresh sliced cucumber would have been a nice touch. Great alternative to the other fast food chain stores nearby.  Fast and courteous service. Very clean place. Less expensive, more homestyle than Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"Flaming Kabob is one of the few things I miss about living in Mesa, AZ.  The BEST chicken kubideh I have ever had!  I just can't find anything to compare (even in the DC area where I now live).  I always got the rice instead of the french fries because it is sooo flavorful - tastes like they cook it with chicken stock and the golden raisins they add to it just makes it delish.  Upgrade to the greek salad for a $1.  The mango smoothie and hummus are also to die for!"}
{"text":"I can't  say enough about Flaming Kabob, both the Tempe and Mesa locations.  The food is always fresh and good quality.  The portions are large.  My favorite is the chicken kafta, which is a well seasoned ground chicken kabob.  Both the sandwich and the platter are great!  I get the rice as a side and love how moist and flavorful it is, especially with the almonds and raisins.  The service is always friendly and polite.  The owner is always present at one of the locations and greats everyone with a smile and friendly hello.  Give this place a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Sooo good! I'd like to come here every time I visit family. I loved the salad and the pita bread is so fresh. I ordered the Chicken Gallaya which was amazing.  The waiter liked to joke around with the cooks so that was fairly entertaining to watch. This place has made me excited to try more mid eastern food I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. The food is excellent. I always get the chicken shawarma. Best in the valley! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I came here as a last minute choice. I always pass it every time I'm around Tempe area. So my curiosity lead me here. I was going to go to Halal Guys but I wanted to give this place a chance to see how good it is. I ordered a combo plate of the shish kabob and a water cup. The food came in unexpectedly fast since literally the place was the dead.  I took a bite out of my kabob and it was extremely chewy. It wasn't tough or hard. Its soft and chewy. Even my plastic knife couldn't cut it. I tried to break it down as much as I can but I had to put my finger in my mouth to pull the kabob apart.The kabob was also very bland, the salad was fresh but was also very bland along with the sauces they provide gave it a little bit of flavor yet overall it was disappointing. The water cup they gave me had some stuff on the water. I refused to drink it. My pita bread was good and soft but the price I paid for was around 17 dollars after taxes was not worth the experience i was hoping for. It was near closing time so I'm not sure if that affects the quality of the food. I willing to give this place another chance someday but I will stick with my favorite places like Greek wraps exceptional prices, portions and flavor on their kabobs, kaftas and their sauces."}
{"text":"Delicious middle eastern food (I ordered the gyro sandwich) and great service! The waitress was very friendly. I recommend flaming kabob"}
{"text":"Just WOW!  This is the Best place I have ever found!  I didn't want to stop eating. And for the very first time,  I asked for a box for the food I just couldn't finish.   We ordered the Lentil soup and a Chicken and lemon with rice aoup as one of the sides for the Gyro plate and the chicken kabob plate.   I can't explain how great it was. The fries are awesome as well. Ask for garlic sauce to add more flavor that in my opinion is not needed.   Overall a fantastic experience and the most flavorful Mediterranean food place ever!    Thank you."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT if you know what you want.  DO NOT DO DELIVERY.... The guy sat outside our house for 15 minutes just standing around. We had to go outside ask him if he was from the restaurant. No call, no knock, nothing. He just stood at his car. If one of us hadn't peaked outside who knows how long we would have waited..  Ok, that aside...the Gyros are delicious! The hummus is some of the best I've had (make sure you ask for pita bread). The \"Flaming Kabob's Combo For Two\" is a really good want to try the food out the first time, that is what we did. You get a bit of everything. It's a lot of food for $25.00.   We always call in and pick up the food and its ready within 15 mins. Always hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"Food is good and plentiful. However, the music is too loud and almost ruins the atmosphere. This place took over a diner and the style hasn't changed so it contradicts the style of food served. Not a bad place but I won't be starving to come back."}
{"text":"IF THE DELIVERY APP ON YELP DOESN'T WORK, JUST CALL THE RESTAURANT!!!! Another fast and delicious delivery received!   We love the combo for 2 which gives you everything you need for a terrific dinner for two and plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day. In addition, i ordered the garlic chicken too from treasing other yelp reviews and it was amazing with lemony garlic sauce that was delicious on the sweet raisins in the rice!   Great family restaurant and the family is wonderful and dedicated to fresh quality foods. Out of literally hundreds of orders of catering or personal orders, we have never had a bad meal. You can't beat the price and quality for catering your next family or work event.  Favorites include gyro mear, chicken kabobs, salads, and the hummus if the best in the state!!!"}
{"text":"Went in on Saturday, a few days ago. I made sure to check in using the yelp app. Because I want to make sure this review sticks. First, I should tell you that this used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. The food has always been outstanding, service was always decent, but let me tell you about this disaster.  When we walked in, we each ordered a glass of water and I ordered a fresh squeeze juice. There was only one waitress, and there were six dirty tables in the restaurant. So when we walked in, we didn't get to sit where we wanted to set, but just had to choose one of the only clean tables. After we ordered our water and juice, the waitress promptly went over to a table, on the other side of the restaurant, and sat down with her friends. While the restaurant remained filthy, she sat down.  After about 15 minutes, we hear the juice machine grinding. She heard it too, because she got up off her ass, and finally brought us our drinks. A good 20 minutes after we sat down.  It was after 8 PM, and we did not want to order anything too heavy. So we ordered the cold appetizer plate, and a fattoush salad. The hummus and baba ghanouj were both bland. The tabbouleh was horrible, and desperately needed more lemon juice and olive oil. It was basically a plate of parsley. The salad, which used to be a bright colorful, crispy salad came out looking like it was made hours ago. The Romain lettuce was wilted and brown. The tomatoes were pink and orange. Way, way underripe. As soon as she dropped the salad, I told her to take it away. I'm not paying $10 for a pile of wilted lettuce that looks like it came out of the dumpster.  It was for that reason, that I dared to point out the shitty salad on my table, that she never came back to check on us. Instead, she went across the restaurant and sat down with her friends again. We wanted water. I wanted to tell her that the hummus was bland. But she was too busy talking to her friends to care.  I left, disgusted. And all of the tables were still dirty when I left, and now there was one more-the one we just used. If the dining room looks like that, the kitchen must be a filthy nightmare. I will never, ever eat at this restaurant again.  Yelp-- we should have a zero stars option."}
{"text":"Divey atmosphere but RELIABLY very good food and service at a reasonable price. I've eaten here many times and have NEVER had a bad meal. I also think their french fries are uniquely good. Very sincere chef."}
{"text":"Gods was ok. Nothing special.  Flavored were weak. The service was awful.  Guy was a jerk to all the customers.  He and the cook were arguing the whole time."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! The owner and his children are very friendly. They treat you as family right off of the bat.  We have been going there for 5 years and have no intentions of stopping. The food is authentic and excellent! Try it."}
{"text":"I ate beef shawrma in this place last year and it was amazing. Recently, I came back to eat here but the showrma was yucky!"}
{"text":"Anytime there is kibbeh and grape leaves with meat on the menu my interest is piqued. They didn't have the meat grape leaves since they sold out. Which I'm taking as a good recommendation. The kibbeh left me wanting more. Very grateful that there is a place nearby making these dishes. If you've ever made these dishes you'll understand the amount of grinding and patience you must have. The pay off is worth it.   The staff here more than welcoming and eager to chat. Love it!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, Tasty Kabob, you are no longer by go-to venue for meat on a stick.  The kafta and kibbee are the best I've ever had, super savory and perfectly spiced. Chicken is - rarity of rarities - tender and juicy while at the same time well-seasoned and seared on the outside. Hummus had great flavor, although I will take Pita Jungle's any day for texture/consistency.  An all around fabulous meal for the money.  And a huge amount of it!  If they hadn't let a color-blind kindergartner do the interior design (cartoon flames!?) it would be a near-perfect skewered-beast experience."}
{"text":"Great all around. Reasonably priced. Family owned. Nice place to take someone who has never had middle eastern food.  All the meats are spiced very nicely.  I've been twice. The combo for two is a good place to start.  Second time I had the chicken Shwarma which was excellent."}
{"text":"This place has definitely gone downhill. I ordered the gyro and fries. The gyro was dry and tasteless and the fries were under cooked. We were served by the teenage daughter that had better things do to. The place itself was pretty dirty, I can only imagine what the kitchen is like. I wont be back. Good luck Flaming Kabob!"}
{"text":"Don't let the negative review sway you.  We ate here.  My husband and I both had the Gyros and an order of the hummus.   Both did not disappoint! The hummus was smooth wit great flavor and an abundant supply of pita bread.  The gyros were packed with MEAT... yes I said MEAT!!! It was a sliver or two with tons of veggies.  Nope.  They did it right.  They packed it with their delicious meat and added touches of tomatoes and onions and tazikki.   We took the Baklava to go... truth be told we were too stuffed to sit and eat it there.  The place was grand.  Our waitress was very kind and welcoming and came back to check on us several times."}
{"text":"Given how mouth-watering delicious their other restaurant is in Mesa, I thought I'd give this restaurant a shot--a few times.  Sorry.  It's like night and day in terms of the food quality.  While their Mesa restaurant prepares succulent meat in this wonderful lemon sauce, their Tempe one serves dried out flavorless meat.  I just don't get the disconnect between the two places and it's a shame.  I'd rather chew on some charcoal briquettes than try downing some of their Tempe division's food again."}
{"text":"Went there specifically for the lamb kabobs that my hubby adores.  Out of lamb, you say? A middle-eastern restaurant called Flaming Kabobs out of lamb?  Out of lamb you say?  Am I to believe that I drove.... miles (I don't want to say how far I drove to get hubby's lamb!)  and you DON'T have lamb?  Yes. I understand now.  You DON\"T have lamb!   Hubby had to choose beef kabobs (which I could make at home).  Asked for them bloody-----not rare---bloody!  Plentiful kabob dish came out and when he cut into them they were medium, only one or two pieces were rare.  That's two disappointments in one evening.  Hubby, kept silent (he is the strong, silent type) and ate.  He made the best of his over-cooked kabobs, but then again most people eat them medium or medium rare so the cooks were not skilled in preparing kabobs according to HIS palate.  He had a very good salad with it,  some pretty good rice (although I think it is converted rice and not real rice) and plenty of warm pita.  I ordered a small vegetarian appetizer that was delicious and they gave me more than enough pita to clean my plate of the vegetarian delights.   So all in all they had two strikes against them--no lamb and overcooked beef kabobs (I will ignore the converted/minute rice).  That means that I have to deduct two stars from 5 leaving 3.  But as you can see, I gave them 4 stars-- one additional star for the lovely young lady who waited on us. Could you please buy some lamb for your customers?  Thank you."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Wonderful food, excellent service, reasonable prices-- this should be on your must try list when in the area.  Its located in a fifties-style diner building, complete with shiny metal exterior and space age interior.  Admittedly, that's kind of weird, but don't let it scare you away.  This is really great, really authentic middle eastern food.  We got the dinner for two, which was really enough for two large mammals.  This gave a sampling of many items, so we'd know what to order when returning.  Standouts for me were the salad, hummus, beef kabob and the rice.  I even liked the falafel, which I generally won't touch.  My only regret is that they were out of grape leaves, that and I'm too stuffed to try dessert!"}
{"text":"Our son took us here for Sunday dinner while they were in town. The food is simply awesome! And if you've never tried Mediterranean food like we hadn't you will be amazed by the taste.  He ordered the combo plate which was 41.99. It came with a large  Greek salad, a large platter of hummus, gobs of pita bread on which to put the hummus. There was 4 lamb chops and two large shish kebabs Plus some lamb tips and then on the other side was chicken which was so tender. Since they were flying out I got to bring home all the leftovers!  That combo could easily have fed five!  The only thing that wasn't very good was there weak tea."}
{"text":"60's themed diner turned meditteranean spot. The seats are bright yellow and red and you can still see the diner decor come out in places but now there's additional Mediterranean themed decor too. Interesting combo. Great homecooked style dishes that will bring you back for more. Plus the server is so sweet! She's always there when I go and so friendly. I usually order my go to pita bread, hummus, tahini, and falafel. My favorites! This place has some of my favorite fafafel. Crispy, crunchy, but not drowning in oil. They give you a ton of food, very family style, so I always have leftovers and they're like pizza, somehow even better the next day! I've tried their falafel gyro with veggies too and it was pretty good. Have tried to order pita and hummus as an appetizer so many times and finally realizing that it is a meal all in itself. Recommend for comfort food, warm pita is good for a chilly evening but the vegan fares are pretty light so it still tastes good in the summer because not going to sit in your stomach and weigh you down. Classic Mediterranean fare and family friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was the best Mediterranean food I've found in the Valley. Far surpassed any expectations we had walking in. My friend and I ordered the Meal for 2 and we ate way more than either of us planned and still had leftovers for lunch the day. Out of the huge variety of food that came, everything we had was just amazing. This is going to be our go-to place for Mediterranean from now on!"}
{"text":"The food may have been good if it were delivered at least warm. Ordered online for delivery. Delivery charge as well as tip was charged to my card prior to delivery. When I called the restaurant 20 minutes after the established delivery time, the employee just said \"all deliveries are out and should be delivered anytime.\" Then he hung up the phone. Food was delivered 43 minutes at the time they gave as a delivery time, and the food was very cold.   Will not be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"We have been in Mesa for twenty years and I cannot believe we never found this place until a few months ago. We are so happy to have authentic Arabic food right around the corner from our home! The food here is authentic and very well prepared. We enjoy every visit like we were going to Tayta's for dinner."}
{"text":"We stopped by Flaming Kabob for lunch and were pleasantly surprised.  The atmosphere is nothing to write home about - a former diner with little decor to indicate it is now a kabob house.  Not much atmosphere.   However, the hummus was excellent and served with plenty of pita bread.  I had the chicken kabobs with rice, which served for two meals for me.  The rice had raisins and almonds in it and was very tasty.  My husband had the gyro platter and said it was excellent as well.  There was more pita served with the meal, and we were wondering if they made their own pita there as it was very good.  I enjoyed my meal of leftovers today and it was just as good as lunch yesterday!  We'll be back and hope you will give it a try!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem yesterday and I'll definitely be returning! Their Homous and vegetable grape leaves had my mind blown! Can't wait to get back there and indulge in their baba ganoush and spinach pie. If you are looking for authentic and flavorful Mediterranean food, this place is a must!"}
{"text":"This is one of those place where you drive by, and you see a catchy sign that says something ridiculous like \"$5 lunch\" and you say, \"Sure...why the hell not!\"  One day, I was driving by and I literally said...\"Sure...why the hell not!\" I needed lunch, was a little tight on cash, so I popped in for a quick lunch, and much to my surprise, I was treated to a perfect Gyro lunch for five bucks.  The food was great. Nothing was stale, or old. The pita was fluffy and delicious. The lettuce was fresh and crisp. The meat was juicy and tasty...it made you feel like you were in the middle of a bazaar in Turkey, Armenia or Lebanon. So delicious.  The guy that ran the joint was pretty cool too! He'll make small talk with you, and he is passionate about his restaurant. I dig.  The bathroom was relatively clean too.   Also, you can bring your picky-eater friends here. There is something for everyone. Chicken. Beef. Seafood. Vegetarian. Even your supermodel friends who just want to sit outside and smoke and drink Evians."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here last week and it was delish! You can't beat the lunch specials for $5.99! We had the gyro and my mom had the rice with hers, I went with fries. I made the better of the choice but the rice just wasn't my style. She liked it. The waiter was a cute friendly young guy. Couldn't have been nicer. I wasn't overly blown away by the tsaziki but it was decent. I will totally go back to try other food items and I'd recommend this place to friends who love Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Everything was flavorful. Loved all the spices , sauces and dressings. The service is fast and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Always enough food left to take home. Best grape leaves I have had in a long time. Great for family style meal."}
{"text":"I have traveled to the middle east and I have had many dishes in places as such as Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, UAE etc.. and I found these people have it spot on. The food was fantastic! I give this place 4 stars on the food alone. The service was nice, The owner was very cordial, and the waitstaff were attentive. The food took time to get to the table. The crowd of muslims with the screaming, unruly children made it almost unbearable to have dinner. Our food was warm, the people that came in after us got thiers befor us and I was figuring our food would take a bit longer. Service was ok, the cleanliness was subpar. I want to really, really like this place. I guess with time and effort, this will be one of the best middle eastern/Mediterranean restaurant in the east valley. I love the food. that is all folks."}
{"text":"Flaming Kabob has an unusual look to it but don't judge a book by its cover. A 1950's look throughout the restaurant, the food has what it takes for you to come back.I wanted to try some dishes to see what my pallet would like. I had Baba Ghannouge ,which was tasty. Falafel  which was hard on the outside but moist and flavorful on the inside.Chicken Shawarma in a pita bread with tomato and a garlic sauce.My favorite thing of the meal. My wife had  Maza combo. The only thing in the combo that was her least favorite was the Tabbouil. Thw waitress was friendly and helped us out on what to order. If you like Mediterranean food I recommend a visit."}
{"text":"I gave the restaurant 2 stars. The food was good (great Hummus) but this restaurant was FILTHY. We were their first guests of the day! Floors dirty. display case filthy. Booths unwiped. Crap everywhere...."}
{"text":"Good: The gyros are really good! Ever since moving here from California I've been attempting to find a place to replace Farmer Boys for my gyro fix. This place measures quite high in that regard. I usually get two of them just for myself because they are that good. The waitresses are really nice and friendly, and the waiters can be quite comical at times. I've met the owner before and he was a really cool guy.  Bad: The look of the store can use improvement. I'm fairly certain that this location used to be a Five & Dinner, and it is virtually unchanged. They've added an awesome assortment of hookahs and a big camel sculpture inside, but it doesn't do much to improve the atmosphere unfortunately.   Other Thoughts: I don't typically order anything other than the gyros, so I can't really comment much on the other foods. My girlfriend says the kabob skewers are hit or miss depending on who is preparing them."}
{"text":"Food is juicy and delicious. My order was mistaken but I eating it unknowingly and was knocked out of my socks!"}
{"text":"If you plan on eating in make sure you have plenty of time. The service is friendly and nice but pretty slow. You have plenty to look at while you're waiting since it's in an old 5&Diner, but with Mediterranean decor added in...  They even have hookah smoking available outside now.  We usually order the dinner for two, to go. It's ready and waiting when we get there. It provides enough food for both of us to eat two full dinners, plus a little lunch for me later. Very yummy!"}
{"text":"We place an order for delivery from here as least twice a month. I love places that deliver! The deliveryman is always nice and they are willing to make your smoothie the way you want. I prefer their gyro plate and their rice. They offer a family plate which was nice when you have friends over."}
{"text":"Always great food. I love the lemon rice chicken soup. The service is always so nice and fast."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment :( I hadnt been to the Flaming Kabob in a while..last times everythung was good. This time nothing was even kind of good. I was hoping to get Spanikapita (sp?) But, the gal taking my to go order said they dont have it but have something similar so I got it...she asked if i wanted it w/fries or rice , i chose rice. I also paid $2 extra for tabouli salad instead of regular salad. The tabouli was the only thing that was decent...unfortunately, the rest was not only very greasy but was tasteless and heavy. The baklava was stale and dry. Im SO bummed. I had high hopes.  Im tired of so many restaurants being disappointing. It sucks"}
{"text":"I ordered from grubhub tonight. When the food arrived there was animal hair in the bag. Part of my order was wrong, they delivered something else instead. They must have been out of what I ordered but they didn't bother to call me to tell me so. Since there wasn't any animal hair in the food I tried it. It was no longer hot and wasn't very good. The soup had about a tablespoon of rice at the bottom of the cup and the rest was broth. A waste of $20.00"}
{"text":"We searched our area for a place to go to dinner.. The 4 stars made the decision... So the Food was okay, not great- slightly burnt taste on everything.  The menus and restaurant were dirty ... But then the service.... Basically sucked. First we go to order our entrees- out of the four or five different dishes they had available. Finally get to something they do have. Should have left. We finished eating and sat there for at least ten minutes, employees everywhere, I proceeded to wave my arms in the air for at least a minute,started clapping until someone was kind enough to walk ten steps to see what kind of emergency was taking place. Get the check. Finally. 50 bucks for two dinners and hummus. Look over while signing the check, big booger on the wall next to me, nice. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered the Flaming Kabob's Family Special (3 shish kabobs, 3 chicken kabobs, 3 shish kaftas, shawarma, 4 falafels, 4 grape leaves, rice, salad, and hummus and pita).  Everything was delicious, flavorful and could feed 4-5 people for $55.  I would come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I ordered the Gyro combo with fries. Gyro had a wierd taste to it that it almost tasting like Clorox for some reason. I dont know if the smell got into what the cook was making or if it was close to the grill. Whatever it was, I didn't finish it and I'm a big guy.  The fries are frozen. No effort to even buy real potatoes, peel, and deep fry. They were underdone as well.  For $7 I guess I should not complain to much but that place but another place down the street for $8 is fantastic and will always choose the other place. At least I tried it for you so you don't have to. I'm sure it's a family place and they are really nice as other reviewers have stated but this place will not last if they can get a gyro out in 2 minutes flat with fries. More effort is needed for fresh ingredients and fresh cut fries."}
{"text":"Went in here on Thanksgiving night and props for the place being open. Tried the Chicken Gallaya, which came on Tin foil inside the box, along with some excellent rice that was studded with raisins and nuts. The Gallaya was in a brownish sauce with a bunch of mushrooms, green peppers, some onion and nice big chicken chunks. Also got the Greek salad on the side, which is kind of small and they forgot the dressing, but there was at least was some feta cheese. A small side of lemon chicken rice soup tasted burnt and pita bread was average. Probably should have just got a gyro, but meal was decent, if not slightly over priced at $15."}
{"text":"Flaming Kabob is an awesome option for Mediterranean food in the Mesa area.   Portion sizes are no joke here. The hummus appetizer is a huge platter of hummus, along with lots of pita bread. I ordered a gyro lunch combo, which got me the large wrap and a side salad which I'm pretty sure was actually a full size salad. My friend ordered the gyro plate platter, which is easily enough for two meals.   Prices are very good as well, considering how much food you're getting. Seriously, we're talking about a lot of food. I peeked at another table that got some combo meal (I think it's one of the ones that's labeled for two people, but its easily for four largish people).   I can't get over how much food they give you for the price. So if you're looking for a lot of food, this is probably the place to go."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelpers, we took the leap and had lunch here.  I'd seen it before...  bright, shiny and  looking conspicuously like a former Five-and-Diner on Baseline.  I'll admit, the exterior was a bit off-putting but Yelpers inspired me to give it a shot and I'm glad we did.    As mentioned in other reviews, the lunch prices can't be beat.  The hummus was fantastic - strong tahini and lemon flavors.  The falafel most certainly is not from a mix (or if it is, I'm betting it's in a language I can read nor speak).  The rice is uber simple but fantastic.  I don't know why.  Perhaps they ground up fairies?    Fairy dust or no, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love the chicken lemon rice soup. This is a awesome family owned restraunt. It is a little more expensive then other places in town, but the flavor and quality of food is worth it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite hole-in-the-wall restaurants. They have great food and great prices. Lunch specials are awesome and delicious. Authentic Greek food at great prices. Must try their rice. A big portion for $3.99. Why the four stars- im a clean freak and the bathrooms are always gross. I carry a hand sanitizer with me and alway use the bathroom before I go into flaming kabob. The tables are a little sticky and in the summer they keep the place pretty toasty. Still keeping going back because food is delicious. They have an A rating from health department so I know they keep the kitchen clean and in the end, that's all that matters."}
{"text":"We've come here now and then over the last few years and the food is good and the wait staff are nice and we always get quick service.   It's always a very inexpensive quality meal.  My only ding on this place is the parking lot is never cleaned and over the last 9 years it's turned really bad outside the restaurant including trash on the sidewalks.  There's also the overgrowth of greenery taking up the parking spaces and they have trash in them as well.  When you leave in your car you'll notice all the trash on the backside of the property as well. We've actually talked about not coming here anymore.    If the developer doesn't want to pay someone to clean up the parking lot then the restaurant owner should. I would if I was the owner.  I would honestly be embarrassed to bring someone here and wouldn't for that reason alone.  10-2017 More than a year later and you can see no one cares about the lot."}
{"text":"The kabobs looked delicious. But once I cut into a piece it was NOT cooked, it was completely raw and I mean red raw inside. What a disappointment- we were so excited to find kabobs to only be let down. Fortunately, I had my salad to eat. I am not the type who sends food back. I just will not eat it and not return again. So I rate them at 0 - had to at least pick one on yelp which I find ridiculous because some place do not deserve even one. Maybe yelp needs to fix the rating system and also allow 1/2 stars. (Yelp only gets 1/2 star)"}
{"text":"The excellent waiter who used to wait on us, must have found a better serving job. Without him, the \"service\" was unbearable.  The woman who took our order was much more interested in watching her reality television program with another girl. The TV was so disquieting that my daughter and I could not enjoy our time. Since it was completely inappropriate for a child, we sat on the same side of the booth with our backs to the TV.  The mustachioed waitress treated us abruptly, sending us the message that she either hated her life, her job or us. She did not listen to the details of our order, she harshly plopped the plates on the table, never asked us how our food was and never refilled our beverages.   She did however, sit 10 feet away from us, slumped expressionless, staring straight ahead at the TV.  My little daughter approached her with an empty cup for a refill and the woman didn't even acknowledge her presence until she was standing right next to her.     The food is not good enough to be worth parking the car, going in and seeing if that miserable woman is still working there. There are just too many other restaurants to try."}
{"text":"This place has the worst delivery drivers ever.  One got lost and called me for directions.  But it was difficult for me to give directions because the delivery driver didn't know where she was.  She also didn't know where Scottsdale Road was.  She got defensive about that and told me that she wasn't from here.  Turns out she was from Mesa (where Scottsdale Road is a place of myth and legend?).  When my food finally did arrive, it was barely warm.  The driver last night also got lost.  When he did eventually find my place, he only gave me half of my order.  He drove away with the rest and had to come back.  He says it happened because it was dark outside and he couldn't see my food in the car.  WTF?  Again, the food was barely warm.  I put my exact address into GubHub when I order.  Why don't these drivers have GPS?    The food is too salty and only OK because of the convenience of late-night delivery.  With such bad delivery, I say stay away."}
{"text":"Wonderful flavors, variety of choices.  Service is very personable.  We went a few times when we were in this part of town and really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The restaurant occupies a classic American diner building with all the requisite chrome and neon outside and in, but the fare served here is standard Mediterranean, well prepared and reasonably priced. The flavors are robust, a pleasing interplay of lemon, garlic, cinnamon, parsley and other herbs. Service is efficient and friendly and parking is no problem. This place is several steps above its sister restaurant in Tempe."}
{"text":"The food has definitely gone down in the past year, very little flavor.  There was no lamb but the menus still reflected many lamb dishes. It was very disappointing after our last visit when everything was great."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I *love* Middle Eastern food. I have tried many restaurants is search of great examples of this cuisine. Flaming Kabob serves excellent food from a family owned, local restaurant.   This restaurant offers friendly, knowledgeable service and help navigating the menu. There was a lot of selection available for vegetarians including hummus, tabouli, stuffed grape leaves, moujadara, falafel, spanikopita and more. Of course lots of choices for the carnivores too.  We started with an appetizer of flaming cheese served with warm pita bread which was decadent and delicious. For my entree I tried the vegetable gayalla, a sort of stir fry of onion, green and orange peppers, mushrooms and carrots in a butter-garlic sauce. It came with a choice of two sides. I chose the lentil soup and the rice as my sides. Other sides included Greek salad and french fries.  The lentil soup was good but not exceptional.   The rice was a moist and flavorful outstanding pilaf with golden raisins and slivered almonds. The gayalla was totally scrumptious. My dining companion, who is a meat eater, wished that she had ordered the same entree. I had been tempted to try several other items on the menu, but they were all items I had tasted before at other restaurants. I was very, very happy that I tried the new (to me) dish.   Service is not speedy because everything is made fresh, but it's worth the wait. Drinks were refilled and servers checked on us frequently  As other reviewers have noted, the ambiance is a tad strange since the restaurant is housed in an old \"5th & Diner\" building, and still has the original diner booths and long counter, but with the addition of some hookahs. All I can say is: get over it and enjoy the food. Flaming Kabob is not at all close to my house, but next time I am in the area I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Flaming Kabob is flaming awesome!  I had food delivered to my hotel very quickly and while I had to order $20 min order, for just myself, the food is so tasty I will have breakfast and lunch, so I think it was a good deal.  The chicken kabob had great spices and just the right amount of char, the garlic sauce was tasty and I got a salad which was very crunchy and very fresh.  I found the baba gannoush not as eggplanty as I've had before but it was still very tasty.  Overall, a really tasty (couple) meals!"}
{"text":"Had the gyro lunch plate, it was only ok. The tzatziki sauce was runny and there wasn't enough."}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  Place is funky, weren't many people in there for a Saturday lunch (especially considering the proximity to ASU) but the service was decent and the food was good.  Very inexpensive, 2 lunches and drinks for $15.  I'll stop by again when I'm out that way."}
{"text":"Wow this place is a gem! So delighted with the Chicken Shawarma. My boyfriend loved the Gyro. It's affordable for the amount of food that is served. I loved loved loved the warm lentil soup and the fresh pita bread. Try this place out! You'll be happy you did"}
{"text":"I love this place. Iv been eating the food here for the last 5 years it's been open and it hands down beats the local Mideast food. Yeah the service when you sit down in lack luster.. It's bad let's just a say it. But the food is very authentic and the owner very personable. I'd suggest calling in an order and bringing it home. But at least try the food!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the friendly service and the chicken with garlic and cilantro entrée.  This is my favorite craving lately, even more so because I've had a horrible cold, and this dish makes me feel so much better.  When I stopped in yesterday I also had some of the chicken lemon rice soup, which was the epitome of comfort food.  I'm surprised I'm not cured by now!  But, I'm definitely on the mend.  I wish I lived closer to either location because I would eat here weekly for sure.  Someday I'll actually try a kabob or a gyro, but for now it's the garlic and cilantro chicken dish all the way.  The flavors blend together so well, and the last time I had this dish, I put the leftovers in the back of the fridge for a couple of days, and it got even better!  Highly recommend.  It may seem a little steep at $15.99 to others, but the quality is definitely first rate, and I can get 3 meals out of it."}
{"text":"My dad talked us into going here and we were pleasantly surprised! It was totally empty when we walked in which is often a bad sign, but the longer we sat there the more the place filled up.  As has been mentioned, the decor doesn't match the type of food AT ALL. I've passed here a zillion times and always thought it was a diner or something. It's definitely not what you'd expect!   First of all, I can't say enough about the waitress we had. It's a family owned restaurant and I think we met most of the family, but Neswa (I'm sorry if I'm spelling it wrong if you see this!) was absolutely darling! She made the whole experience for us with her enthusiasm and bubbly personality.  Anyway, the food was good. We had a two person meal with some schawarma (which I tried for the first time!) and other things. I'm not sure how good it was compared to other Mediterranean food because I'm not super familiar with it but the meat was well cooked and the pita bread was delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is good, and middle eastern food has always been one of my favorites. I just for a fact cannot shake the feeling that I have been lied to and cheated. The sign outside says gyros are 2$, I came around 4 so I understand if the specials are over, but the menu advertises sandwiches to be around 4-5 dollars. There was even a special ASU deal that was not written out but supposedly gave me a free drink and side. After I purchased a 5.99 sandwich, I supposedly received a free side and drink. Ringing up after I paid about 10 dollars.   With tax, it becomes 6.55, I tipped 1.50, so should have came to be about 8 dollars. I don't mind paying extra, or just having tipped more, but deliberately changing the pricing on the spot is a bit low by my standards. This may have been a miscommunication, perhaps free didn't necessarily mean free. Or I heard wrong."}
{"text":"My chicken was raw. I sent it back and it came back to me shriveled up and dried out. My friends meal was better but nothing to rave about. The staff was fantastic...but we wont be back."}
{"text":"The owner and his family are wonderful people.  They make you feel at home and strive to please the customer.  We have eaten here many times and are always pleased.  You can't beat the price for the dinner for 2 combo meal.    The chicken and rice soup is really good and my daughter LOVES it.  I love the baba ganoush at Flaming Kabob the most!   The fattoush salad is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I have done both dine in and take out here many times. Really excellent gyros, kibbee and hummus. We always get the appetizer combo and gyros. Last time got lamb and kabobs, which were great. Part of the reason we usually do  takeout here is the atmosphere is odd and the service slow. Someone mentioned how hot it is inside, and I agree. The interior is an old five and diner.  The standout for me here is the kibbbee which is very flavorful and crispy. Gyros are great too. Lamb and beef kabobs are very good. Overall excellent food."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place and omg why did I wait so long!? We called in a take out order and I'm glad we did because the restaurant itself seems kind of odd. 50s diner, no music random stuff thrown into booths. Anyway, the food was amaaaaaazing. We got the saganaki - fried cheese served with bread, gyros and a salad. Way too much food. We ended up saving the salad for another meal. The gyros are huge and delicious. Saganaki was amazing as well. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I started ordering from Flaming Kabob when it was recommended to me through Grubhub and they've never disappointed. Two of my favorite dishes are their gyros (perfectly seasoned meat, and some of the best tzatiki sauce I've ever had), and their rice (made of light yellow rice with white raisins). Delivery (which I believe is only available through GrubHub) is fast, and the food has always been hot when I received it. I love Flaming Kabob, and will continue to be a patron as long as their service and food remain high quality."}
{"text":"American diner with mediterranean food, haha. The food here is good and a little of something for everyone. The owner was really nice! He had a wonderful personality and gave us a contact number to his friend when he heard my hubby and I would visit Michigan, how kind! Lots of seating. The braised lamb is succulent good!"}
{"text":"All around consistently good but I'm consistently ordering the gyros and chicken swarma. The meats are tender with lots of flavor. Portions are generous and could easily make two meals out of it(I should give it 5 stars for that)Don't miss out on the hummus it is heavenly!  They also have some juicing concoctions that I enjoy while I wait."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the plate for 2. Wow!! It was not only very tasty but huge! We both are our full and took home 3 boxes of leftovers while leaving most of the salad there.   Here's the breakdown: Iced tea is strong! Water tastes yucky -not filtered Salad is fresh and minty. All depends on your personal taste.  Hummus was toppled with fresh parsley and cumin. The taste was very good.  Garlic sauce was also fresh and (of course) super garlicky (not our favorite but nothing wrong with it) Tahini - very good Rice - Soooo good!! The raisins on top were surprisingly yummy  Chicken Kabob- excellent  Chicken shawarma - excellent  Steak kabob - excellent  Grape leaves- the only ones I've ever liked. Normally I find them to be quite nasty  Falafel - by far the best we've ever had.   All in all - a surprising treat. We will be back and bring guests."}
{"text":"just had lunch here today.  the entire experience was great.  nice small place with great service. i had the chicken gyro and my wife had the chicken schwarma. both were absolutely amazing.  looking forward to trying a few new things here in the near future. oh yeah...the prices are VERY fair!"}
{"text":"Good food asked for delivery and the guy was off  The owner had it delivered  nice job  great food."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food was always fresh, tasty and the service excellent. Unfortunately came in with my family we all order something different which would make it difficult to just critique based on 1 type of dish. First the server just seemed lost the entire time, from providing utensils and taking the order. She brought out 1 out of 5 dishes to us and 1 out of 2 dishes for the table next to us. We asked for small plates so we can share the large hummus appetizer and she brought out only 3 and asked if that was enough, mind you we are a party of 5. They brought out our soups and they all didn't have enough flavor and barely warm, then we had salads with our meals and the salads had no dressing, they just glistened with oil only had to ask for the lemon dressing and the waitress brought out cut lemons. As for our 2 appetizers, the hummus tasted good only issue was that we had a puddle of olive oil (I hope it was Olive Oil) in the middle, and the fried kibbee came out with our meals burnt and hard on the outside due to them being frozen.   Now on to the meals, chicken kafta tasted old and had a funny green color, the chicken shawerma was not off a rotating skewer, it was marinated chicken breast sliced. The chicken chunks we had were dry as the Arizona heat plus the waitress forgot to bring out the salad that was substituted for rice and the half grilled chicken was old and had a funny smell and taste. All the dishes came with rice, they were all drenched in oil I could probably see the reflection of the tv. I dont think any of the food that we had was fresh, sorry but this place truly doesnt deserve the 1 star. All this and the tab for 5 was $80 and definitely not worth $20."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and Ahmed was very friendly! I recommend the gyro sandwich, burger, and chicken kabob plate."}
{"text":"We went for dinner last night and thought it was OK.  The service was good and friendly and we like the \"diner like\" vibe of the place.  But we thought the food was severely under seasoned.  The hummus was lacking in sesame paste and enough salt and olive oil; my lamb shank was bland tasting, and so were the chicken kabobs.  Maybe they under season on purpose to suit the tastes of the Western clientele, but the food certainly did not taste like typical Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food.  Oh yeah, prices slightly higher than other similar restaurants which wouldn't be a problem if the food tasted a little better."}
{"text":"Gyro meat tasted like it sits in a refridgerator or on top of the microwave in a tub and is waved when you order.  Tzatziki sauce was curdled.  Made the mistake of using the filthy restroom.  Garbage cans near kitchen were overflowing with food and garbage.  Smell was hideous.  What a dump.  I guess if you were in a 3rd world country, it would an OK restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place every time I come I'm beyond happy with my meal, my children absolutely love it too my wife and I order the flaming kebab combo for 2 and it always last two meals my kids get the gyro sandwiches and say they're the best they've had definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"This is a great place. Food is good, large selection, friendly people, and open late is really nice."}
{"text":"Ate here last night, just about finished my dinner when a roach crawled on my table. Dirty"}
{"text":"We usually eat at their Mesa location the found ourselves looking for something yummy in the Tempe area after getting out of the show we were delighted to see the flaming kebab was less than a mile away. The food was on point as always and we actually had an opportunity to speak with the owner / master chef of the restaurants. Wonderful conversation great food highly recommend"}
{"text":"Excellent food!! The very best Middle Eastern food in the valley. Everything is fresh and wonderful. Very personal and friendly service. I recommend this restaurant highly!"}
{"text":"Don't let the building fool you... the food was really good!  Server was polite!  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I agree with most of the other reviews about this place.  The food is ok at best and the service is a complete cluster fuq.  The value of the food is ok because they give you a decent amount for the price.  It is all just a bit dry and bland.  The service is very helpful and apologetic when something goes wrong, but it really doesn't help because everything was slow.  You almost feel bad because they are very nice, but really don't know what is going on.  The absolute best part of going here was that the establishment was an old 5 & Diner that went out of business.  It was a trip seeing all of the 5 & Diner decor but now with Mediterranean music being played in the background and people eating hummus at the milk shake counter.  All-in-all I'm glad I went there to try it out, but probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I'm doing something I don't usually do, but I'm changing my rating from four to five stars.  I've been here at least a dozen times since I first wrote my review, and I started thinking to myself \"there's got to be a reason I keep coming back so often...\"  The reason is simple.  The food is fresh, fast, and delicious.  The portions are good, and the spices and ingredients are perfect for the dishes they serve.  The prices are also killer: six bucks for a sandwich, fries, and drink, or six bucks for two sandwiches.  You can't beat that.  For a quick casual meal, this is a great option.  There are other places closer to my house, but I still drive the extra five minutes to come here.  The food is great, healthy, and very satisfying."}
{"text":"Good quality food. I would say it's a bit pricy for a college student but the quality is good and I like the flavor of the food :)"}
{"text":"The bomb, The best Mediterranean food . he place is really awesome and the Combo plate was amazing specially the falafel and the rice. Let me begin by saying I *love* Middle Eastern food. I have tried many restaurants is search of great examples of this cuisine. Flaming Kabob serves excellent food from a family owned, local restaurant. When you walk into this place, you get a feeling that you've just stepped into the Twilight Zone. Not because of the food or the service, This restaurant offers friendly, knowledgeable service and help navigating the menu. There was a lot of selection available for vegetarians including hummus, tabouli, stuffed grape leaves, moujadara, falafel, spanikopita and more. Come here, you won't be dissapointed!!"}
{"text":"Had to listen to the server and two customers talk about how they dislike America and that there own countries are much better.  Once they started bashing the US military we couldn't take it and left after displaying our military IDs when paying.  Food was okay."}
{"text":"I was an assyrian taught greek cook for quite a few years.  Sadly they retired and sold their restaurant. I've been on the hunt to find anything and everything that tastes and looks like how I was taught to make it.  I spent a long time finding nothing but poor standard replicas and tastes. I finally found this place and I am so relieved and happy. The food is just...delicious.  I prefer to order delivery instead of dine in because I am told the waiting is rude and snappy. Which I will gladly avoid.  The food is always promptly delivered. And the older gentleman that always delivers is the sweetest most polite man I have ever seen. Its always a joy with this place."}
{"text":"I just ate here for dinner with my parents, this place is located in an old 50's Diner-style building, which makes for an interesting atmosphere when you add Hookas, Hummus & Kabobs to the mix.  The food is delicious & they offer some really great family meal-deals if you come with a larger group of people. There was 5 of us in our party & we ordered the \"Flaming Kabob Family Banquet\" for $49.99 you get so much food!! 3 shish kabobs, 3 chicken kabobs, Kafta, Shwarma, falafel, stuffed grape leaves, rice, a large salad, hummus & pita bread. We all went back for seconds and still had a whole meal to take home with us.  Food was delicious, large portions & reasonable priced!  Family owned & operated, the entire staff was so nice, great service! will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"If I had read these other reviewers review I would probley not come here but i had also stumbled in one day for lunch and thought the food was decent but my wife and i went last nite for dinner and had the baba ganough which was good(i make better) we split the mix grill which is pleanty for 2  and also ordered the falafels which i liked as well and we took a to go container home with enough for a nice snack. we were the only people there at the time ....8ish.....except for the owners family very nice folks but the kiddies were a bit rambunctious."}
{"text":"The meat inside of the Meat Shawarma was tough and salty, as well as, the side order of tzatziki sauce was spoiled!  It was grainy and clotted.  The only thing that was good was the hummus. However, it was a small serving for the price. NEVER again."}
{"text":"Honestly, not my favorite. I got one of the kabob meals for two from Postmates and it was seriously lacking in flavor. The salad was great and the hommus was good, but everything else was dry, tough, and nearly flavorless. Did they use any salt? Even the fries were saltless. Definitely not worth the ~$40 I paid for the meal. I will say that I appreciate the way everything was boxed up and I'm sure the service there was wonderful because we got everything that we ordered. I just wish the food had more flavor. Unfortunately, I am highly disappointed....this isn't the Greek restaurant in the valley that I'll be coming back to when I need a Greek fix."}
{"text":"My first time here and it will be my last time, I was disappointed about the food quality here I seen much better Middle Eastern food then this place and was too expensive for the cheap quality they serve. I'll never return."}
{"text":"The food is on point! Fresh, flavorful and authentic. I had the chicken kebab plate with hummus, rice and fresh salad. Friendly service and reasonably priced.   The only drawback for me was there was some angry news program on the TV, but, mostly filtered it out."}
{"text":"We have been going here three last 3 years and boy has it gone downhill. The prices have gone up, food quality down. They ring phone orders up wrong and try to over charge. The have charged us for extra taziki twice now and haven't included it in the bag. Major disappointment. We will definitely find another place from now on"}
{"text":"Delicious food! This review is coming from an Armenian and a Mexican who know what this food should taste like. Probably the best falafel we've ever had! Great hummus, gyro, salad, rice & beef kebab. They are really generous with the pita bread. We were here for Spring Training and wanted some yummy comfort food. This definitely hit the spot! Highly recommend them & will be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"A well established and some what peculiar setting for a middle eastern restaurant (previously a five and diner). Food is well made and fresh, the servings are large, the combo for two actually feeds 4. The staff appear to be mostly related which adds to the overall customer service. I strongly recommend trying any of the meals here, ordering take out does not diminish the quality or portions."}
{"text":"Although I usually go to the Flaming Kabob in Mesa as that location is closer.  My experience here is the same as the other location; the food is good, the service is great, the location's venue clashes with the style of food.  Occasionally the meat is a little dry as another reviewer stated, but for the price I can overlook that.  I strongly recommend you to try out the food here, dinner and evening times appear to be the busiest due to ASU traffic and everyone getting out of class. They offer delivery, take out, a covered patio, and free Wi-Fi.  Both locations are family owned and run, I've never had a bad experience, I hope you have the same."}
{"text":"Food was good but I can't say I was terribly impressed overall.  The food kind of took a ridiculously long time even when only one other table was in the restaurant.  The appetizers came out fifteen minutes after our main meals - we had figured they forgot about it.  Tastewise, things were decent but not quite memorable.  I had a chicken shawarma and the whole ordeal was filling but a bit on the bland side."}
{"text":"They have an amazing gyro! Not greasy, and they pile on the meat. The pita bread is soft and doesn't break while you're eating. And the price is cheap especially for all the food you get."}
{"text":"Maybe we went on a bad day.  In fairness, this was several months ago, so who knows, maybe things have changed.  We were the only customers in an afternoon, so I know it's not because the place was busy.  In any case, I got a meat dish that was super dry, almost like jerky.  I have the feeling they merely reheated stuff left over from lunch.  My wife's meal was similarly underwhelming and the veggies did not look fresh.  Other people seem to like this place, so again, perhaps it was a bad day.  In any case, we don't plan on returning.  Hope your experience is better."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, of that there is no doubt, but the service recently has completely gone down the drain.  When we ordered from them we were told thirty minute delivery time - it took an hour. We ordered three gyros and more and only half the order was delivered. When we called to make this matter known we were met with a rude manager that could barely be bothered to fix the service issue.   It's been an hour and a half since the original order was placed and we are STILL waiting for our food. Food that was paid for in full.  Absolutely terrible customer service."}
{"text":"This is a Middle Eastern staple in AZ. The falafel and kabobs are some of my favorites, and taste like my mom makes at home. Probably one of my favorite spots for lunch, can't beat that student special!"}
{"text":"Camouflaged as a 5 and diner, this place will make your tastebuds breakdance!! Its been far too long since I've been to the tempe location so I'm a born again fanboy!! I can't go wrong with the sampler for two or a quality gyro or schwarma for only 5 bucks. Serious chomps on top of five star service. I had to take at least one star away for funky restrooms, so i hope thats not a complete deal breaker when selecting your nexr eatery."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Amazing flavors with a attentive staff.  I stop here often after work late in the evening and fill up before calling it a night.  Check it out."}
{"text":"I have had SO MANY wonderful experiences at this restaurant that I had to write a review. My wife and I love to go here for some delicious middle eastern cuisine. The servers are all very accommodating and nice. There is a young man who serves the tables most nights we're in and he is very pleasant at his job. We always get the Flaming Kabob's Combo for Two and enjoy it immensely. The dinner includes: Shish kabob, chicken kabob, shish kafta, chicken shawarma, fried kibbee, falafel and grape leaves. Served with rice, hummus and salad.  A few notes: the rice is AMAZING! It has golden raisins and almond slivers in it. So incredibly good! The hummus is delicious, and I recommend the meat cooked Medium/Medium Well with the exceptions of the fried kibbees (get those well done).  The ambiance is fun, an old 5 & Diner converted into a Middle Eastern Cuisine restaurant. There is a TV on one wall that constantly has a TBS movie on it, which adds to a fun setting. TBS always has some sort of decent background movie on.   All in all, I am a big fan of this place. Very clean, very affordable, and VERY delicious! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got the falafel sandwiches with fries for dinner.  I was not a fan of the fries, but it was the best falafel sandwich I have had in the States!  The owner came out while we were eating and told us about the history of the restaurant.  It was great fun and really cool to chat with him.  When you go be sure to get the whole story for yourself!"}
{"text":"Had a coupon so I thought I'd give it a try.  Had a gyros sandwich with fries and a coke.  Gyros sandwich was very skimpy on the meat, the fries were garden variety frozen.  Luckily, they give you a pretty good serving of fries so you don't go hungry from the tiny gyros.  Maybe I'm used to the football size gyros you get when I lived in Chicago, but this was definitely nothing special.  Doubt if I'll return."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place by accident with a co worker of mine. I noticed it had a fifties vibe but was names flaming kabob. I had to try it. I am a sucker for Arabic food. I was married to an Arab so I know great Arabic food. I actually love to find little holes in the wall like this and be pleasantly surprised. The service is nothing to write home about, but it wasn't bad. The prices were good. I ordered a shawarma sandwich and thought it was wonderful. I don't think I have had it that good in Phoenix yet. Maybe a fluke? Don't know, only been once so far.   Some of the reviews below crack me up. Someone said the hummus needed spice? Um sorry, but hummus does not have spice it!! It's chickpeas, tahini, fresh garlic, salt, olive oil and lemon. I loved what I ate and if I am ever in the area again would definitely eat here."}
{"text":"Super nice amazing place.. Unbeatable taste of Mediterranean food  I went to four different kabob resturants in Tempe and Mesa and i got an idea that kabob restaurants are all the same.. Same kind of food with slight differences in spices, quantity or may be the service But when I went to the Flaming Kabob at Mesa location it was absolutly different.. the place is really awesome and the Combo plate was amazing specially the falafel and the rice. The lintel soup was really tastey.. Very good and quick service. I insist to meet the chef to tell my opinion and she was really nice and chearfull lady Flamming Kabob will be my restaurant every time I have to come to Pheonix"}

{"text":"Best hummus ever! Actually everything we get here is the best. The rice, salad, chicken swarma and bread. The woman who works here all the time is sweet and always knows what we want. A must try at least once!"}
{"text":"Yet another good meal at Flaming Kabob.  Admittedly it is always the \"Lunch Special\" but I've had it numerous times and consistently the same each time over the past few years.  Good gyro, large amount of fries and a soft drink.  I always choose this over any of the nearby fast food places for a good lunch when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Flaming Kabob is Flaming Ka-Awesome.  My girlfriend kept saying she wanted to try this place and we drive by it all the time so tonight we finally did.  We actually ordered it for take out so my review is based on food only.  The inside, however, was very clean and the gentleman who helped us was very polite and friendly.  I had the chicken kabobs with rice and lentil soup and an order of the vegetarian grape leaves.  It was way more food than I could eat and I'm very pleased about this because I will have an awesome lunch tomorrow.  The chicken kabobs were spot on, grilled nicely and tender.  I topped the chicken with a little of their yogurt tzatziki and it was wonderful.  The rice was cooked perfectly and I really enjoyed the combination of spices in it.  There is actually a few raisins in it, too, which I liked.  The lentil soup was very good and all around my meal was just really enjoyable.  My girlfriend had the chicken kabobs as well, with rice, but she got a salad instead of soup.  She loved her meal as well and we are fans."}
{"text":"Lovely little place. Don't let the 50's diner look throw you off. You can't be super judgemental of the appearance either. These are the kinds of foreign food places that are the best. Excellent service and seriously incredible food. I'm even a fan of the middle eastern music they play! It's really nice to get a taste of another country like theirs."}
{"text":"As an Arab, I know when Middle Eastern food tastes genuine and authentic.  The food at Flaming Kabob highlights the flavors that I have grown up tasting and takes it to a brand new level. The owner, Khalil, is also one of the kindest and hospitable individuals that I have ever met. You can taste the love and care that he puts into the food through every bite.   I've tried almost everything on the menu and I can truly say that everything is delightful.  If you are looking for a delicious restaurant with dynamic flavors, Flaming Kabob is the place to go!"}
{"text":"The gyro is good as always but since I left a year ago a lot has obviously changed.   The price of their special went from $5.99 to $6.99. Which is still a good deal. However, when we ordered the waitress asked if we wanted \"freshly squeezed lemonade\" of course we did. What she neglected to mention is that it is NOT included in the drink that goes with the meals. The lemonade is priced at a whopping $3.99 and no refills. Mind you this is in half a mug of slush."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in town to get Kabob's. The service is wonderful here. The food has always been fantastic. My friends and I have come here often, and the food always taste fresh and is super tasty. The also have great specials. Great place to come!"}
{"text":"The place is a little hidden, food is amazing!!! Always fresh. I cannot say enough good things. Chicken Shawarma Pita and Greek Salad are so so good!!!!"}
{"text":"I recommend this place to everyone I know. The owner is spectacular and runs an excellent business. I enjoy the food so much, this place is one of my top picks in Tempe, they also have a Gilbert location as well. Check them out definitely worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim once and just tried it again. They have some pretty solid Chicken schwarma. The portion sizes come in generous and VERY generous. Our server was quick and courteous. The decor is a little odd since it's very 1950s diner. My only real gripe is they seem to be a little understaffed up front, but nothing too serious."}
{"text":"This place has the best Middle Eastern food I've found in AZ. Ambiance inside is not the greatest but the food and friendly service completely makes up for it. Plus, they deliver which is amazing. Saganaki is delicious and my husband eats the Veggie Grape leaves by the handful. Their falafel is my personal favorite along with their beef shish kabob and rice. The combo for 2 is a great way to try a little bit of everything for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants. We love their food so much that we chose them for a food order for a big birthday bash I had this past September. The manager was very friendly and worked with me on getting the best choices and value for the expected number of people. I would highly recommend them for catering order. It was easy, on time,  and of the same level of quality you get when you dine-in."}
{"text":"Best mediterranean food in the east valley. I have tried at least half of the menu and haven't found something I don't like. The hummus is fantastic, the meat is always perfectly cooked and everything is full of flavor. I find myself craving it a lot and wish I could eat here more often. I wish I could give it 5 stars and i would if it was solely based on the food alone. However, because of the service and decor needs a little bit of improvement, I'm only giving it 4 stars. We always get the same server and he is very nice, but seems like he just doesn't want to be there. He could be just a little more attentive. The building is an old five and diner, which is ok, but it needs a little bit of updating and would benefit from a more thorough cleaning.  If you are the owner reading this, please, please, please fix up the interior just a little bit. I'm afraid a lot of people are turned away because of it and I would be so incredibly sad if this place were to close."}
{"text":"The food really is delicious and pretty high quality ingredients.  I've had the chicken shwarma, gyro plate, steak with garlic and cilantro, chicken Gallaya.  They are all very good and portions are sizeable.  The tabouleh is very fresh and always consistently good.  I love the hummus...not too tangy and more beany, which is what I like.  The rice is good but too many raisins at times.  Half the time they do not have any meat grape leaves prepared or have run out by the time I got there. (i usually go there craving and ready to order the grape leaves) Besides that and the fact that I believe they are little over-priced....I will keep coming back and recommending others."}
{"text":"The food is is a treat to your tastebuds! It is healthy and delicious. The people that own the restaurant could not be any nicer. They are so courteous and family oriented. You feel so at home. When you enter the restaurant it is spotless and smells delicious. It is affordable and the portions are HUGE! You Definitely get your money's worth. Give yourself a treat and go try it!"}
{"text":"Not a very impressive visit. I understand that all restaurants have good n bad days, and this one might not be one of their best for sure, because so many nice reviews can't go wrong. Probably not my day, but the food served was literally cold, frozen and reheated. NOT freshly made.  Staff was kinda reluctant and not caring. In general it was bland food. No flavor and cold. I might would give it another try but not very soon"}
{"text":"The food was great, and the owner/server was very friendly. I got the grilled shrimp kabobs, which were a little dark but I would still definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The service could be better.  Much better.  We waited about 10 minutes before we were asked for our drink, which was at the same time we ordered our food.  The food was good.  Not excellent, but definitely good.  I don't think I would go back again just for the mere reason that there are other places to try.  I wasn't extremely impressed."}
{"text":"Food was fine, not good, fine. They took forever and forgot to include part of our order as well as overcharged us."}
{"text":"Yum! We split the dinner plate for two and it was more then enough food. Excellent flavors. Definitely the best Mediterranean food I have had in a long time. The place wasn't that busy, but we were there for an early dinner on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Food was good BUT the place was so filthy that I lost my appetite. It's an old 5 & diner restaurant, they haven't redecorated one ounce. You can literally scrape the dirt and grime off of the chairs, floor and walls. I can't imagine what the kitchen must look like!"}
{"text":"Great little find. This place used to be a 5 and diner. While the decor has not changed, the food has great gyros and Fry's. The ASU special is the way to go. Great food at a great price. Service was very good as well friendly and fast. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I do like other med places around the valley a lot more, but I don't have anything to complain about here (well technically I do...)   My Sis and I stopped in for take out the other night.  I ordered the chicken schawarma and asked to have soup and salad, because I did not want rice or fries (I wanted the rice, but was avoiding more grains in the day) They accommodated me, so I appreciated that a lot.  I also ordered the cobra juice (carrot, beet, apple, carrot, radish) and it was amazing. I could hear the juicer in the back fresh prepping and the juice tasted like everything was very very fresh.  My Sis ordered a gyro meal and hummus.  When we got home, we saw the did not give me the soup or the taziki asked for, so we had to go back, but they were apologetic and that is all I care about really.  Finally I got to eat, I was happy about the very fresh veggies in the salad.  My complaint would be that there was very little flavor in any of the food.  The chicken was bland, the garlic sauce helped and taziki for the salad, because there was no salad dressing.  I tasted my Sister's gyro and it was very good, the hummus was good, again not the best, but good.  Overall, the amazing juice, fresh veggies and yummy taziki helped me enjoy the meal, so I was happy to have an ok and very healthy dinner."}
{"text":"The food here is exceptionally good.  We usually go for a combo platter although this last time I got the chicken gallaya.  Large portions at a reasonable price.  We always seem to have leftovers for lunch the next day.  Make sure to bring extra mints because you will smell like vampire repellent from all the garlic :)  The decor is lacking to say the least..."}
{"text":"Great choice for Mediterranean food! The chicken kabobs and kafta were wonderful. The service was great and will definitely come again. Akmed is a really good guy. Stop in and say hi and enjoy some great food.   Oh yeah, they are open late as well."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The portions were more then enough. We ordered the platter for four and it could have fed six of us. The menu has plenty of choices.  The atmosphere is a little confusing since it's in an old looking 50's diner. I felt the restaurant  could have been a litter cleaner. This is part of the reason for only 3 stars. It was also hard to judge service since we had one waiter that was lack luster, and another that was very attentive. All in all the food was great . I will be back and I will update my review."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is the best.  I've ordered before thru doordash and should give myself many demerits for not writing a review before.  I got the Flaming Kabob's Combo for 2 (Main Entree Combos) and wow.  EVERY item included was amazing. There is a real char on all the kabobs and they are moist and delicious and my syrian boyfriend agrees this shizz is the real deal.  Just wonderful. When I placed my order, they were out of the meat grapeleaves.  SO disappointing as recently I declared their meat grapeleaves to be the best I'd ever had.  But they were apologetic and when I inquired as to whether they were out due to popularity or demand, they said (paraphrasing) that they fly off the shelves.  It's hard to find places that have the ones with the meat because the veg version is so popular.  Anyway, check this place out, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Do NOT order delivery from this place.  My order took almost two hours to arrive after the driver called and asked what apartment I'm in - I live in a house. Upon arrival I noticed the driver has one of the bags on it's side. This was the bag that had my hummus in it so there was hummus and oil all over the boxes in that bag. All of the food was cold. At that point it was hard to say if the food was even any good or not. How good is microwaved food going to taste. Everything was either mushy or hard as a rock.  Never again."}
{"text":"DON'T EAT HERE! The food isn't very great, tiny portions and the \"waiter\" forces what he thinks he should be tipped on to your check all on his own.   This place sucks. While the food was simply OK, the portion was as small as they could make it. The service on the other hand was GARBAGE!!! We walked in and the waiter or buss boy or whatever he was just stood there telling us about food while we waited for him to show us a table. So I ended up sitting down on my own and he followed me. He forgot my friends order or fry's TWICE, he didn't check on our drinks once and to top it off he added a 15% tip to the check on his own? Never had that happen before at a fast food restaurant with a party of 3 people.  I will never eat here again, this place SUCKS!"}
{"text":"The food here is definitely lacking. Over the years, I have tasted some very good barbecue. The meat used at Flaming Kabob was dry and uneventful. They could not handle simple bbq instructions. I ordered the most expensive dish on their menu (beef steak kebab) but it came out like a dollar menu item- uninspiring and dull. Definitely need to improve!"}
{"text":"Don't order delivery via yelp here. I placed an order and it took an hour for them to then send me a msg saying they \"can't currently deliver\" so I just got in the car and drove down there to pick it up to find out they haven't even started the order and proceeded to take another 40 minutes to prepare. Bullshit. My grilled chicken (sorry chicken Shwarma) could have been made by myself In less time at home. For fifty bucks, ill never eat here again, which is a shame because initially I was excited to try this when I first ordered.  **update** I just found out that eat24 did try to contact us sooner but I sid not realize my husband's phone was dead.  That said I will amend from one star to three as the good was fairly good, but it still took almost 40 minutes to prepare the order once I went ro pick it up."}
{"text":"my wife got the chicken and I got the gyro plate. Wait sucked, food was alright and I mostly sat there listening to the guy take orders over the phone the whole time. Seemed like they were more worried about the phone orders than the actual customers there. wouldnt go back."}
{"text":"They always have quality food and wonderful service. Absolutely recommend, great prices also. Try a vegetable drink they juice here. So Good."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I really enjoyed the hamburger. One thing to note, the chicken platter was not that great compared to the gyro and hamburger, so I'd avoid that dish. And the prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"When you walk into this place, you get a feeling that you've just stepped into the Twilight Zone. Not because of the food or the service, but mainly because the restaurant looks like it used to be a 50s diner, but serves gyros and kebobs. The experience get weirder when you go to the bathroom where you for sure know this place used to be a 50s diner because it has the color scheme and poster still on the wall. But, let's get away from the awkward atmosphere and delve into the food.   I feel that there is really not much of an option if you love the taste of kebobs and gyros in Mesa. I mean there is the Pita Jungle chains here and there, but this place is a mom and pop store that delivers some quality food with great service. I've tried the hummus, gyros plates, gyros wraps, shwarma chicken, and lamb shank here before. They were all good and kept me wanting to come back and try other items on the menu. This place really is perfect for yelp reviews because it's not a chain and is owned by a family. The servers have always been nice and friendly too! (always a plus)  Ps. I think you can get hookas here but I've never tried it before."}
{"text":"The food is very food and you get big portions. We got the plate for two called the flaming kabob and it fed three, two adults and one kid. And we had leftovers to take home. I think it is a family owned business. The server was nice. The last time we came it was amazing. This time it was late and they were busy in the back. But I am giving them the benefit of the doubt as the food was very good."}
{"text":"Well amazing, flavorful, fresh all things that come to mind after my meal here. it's an old 50s diner and the food was off the hook. definitely recommend. the hummus was great, I had the stuffed Lamb and we'll damn it was good. mix platter was great and the gyro platter was awesome.  Great job flaming kabob."}
{"text":"the gyro, fries, and drink for $5 is pretty good. bring a friend to chat w/ cuz it may take 10 minutes or so to get your order. the decor could be better."}
{"text":"I like this place, the food tastes like it's homemade and the people working here are very friendly."}
{"text":"The delicious meats, spreads and other concoctions are worth the trip.  The decor, the lighting, the location, not so much, but I put food over decor 9/10 times.  The restaurant that was in this location before left such a bad impression in my mind that I wanted to try this new one quickly. I'm really glad I did.  We went here for a quick bite and wound up having a feast.  Their menu is ambitious, many types of Middle Eastern and Greek influenced preparation styles, each achieved with great success.  The menu features everything east Mediterranean from lamb chops to kibbee to grape leaves to kafta.  The prices are a bit high, but when you look at what you get, it really is a good deal.  The owner was happy to beam about the fact that everything is brand new, everything is made in house and under his watch.  We had the platter for 2.  Now, I'm cheap and a grad student so $25 is a good chunk for a weekday dinner for me, but man was this a bargin.  1 of each: beef kabob, chicken kabob, chicken kafta, beef kafta, hummus plate, salad.  Huge stack of pita, 2 falafel and 2 beef kibbee.  Everything was excellent.  The kabobs were excellently grilled, the falafel was crispy on the outside, fresh and moist on the inside.  The sauces that came with (garlic, tdaziki and tahini) were all great for everything on the plates.  The decor needs a lady's touch and I really hope they spend a little cash in there to fix it up.  The location is prime for selling $5 gyro sandwiches til the cows come home (or at least til the lambs do), but if they want their excellent menu to keep the customers coming back they should fix the lighting and decor.  The old place was like a prison cafeteria, food included.  Out with the old!  I'll be going back for a sandwich for sure.  And with the combo for 2 coupon for $22 they gave us, we might be seeing the huge boxes of leftovers in our fridge again soon."}
{"text":"I went to Flaming Kabob for the 2nd time today.  The first time was around  10pm and today was at 1pm.  Both times I got the shwarma plate.  At dinner it is $15 it comes with shwarma meat, rice or fries and soup or salad.  From 11-3pm it cost $10 with a little smaller portion.  They do have some cheaper stuff if you get the sandwich version instead of the the plate.  The meat seemed different both times I went.   It's nothing to call home about but it hits the  spot especially having the soup or salad first.   Today the food seemed kind of old, the meat were smaller pieces and more dry then when I first went and the  bread was kind of hard.  I'm not a picky eater so I'm not hating on it.    Overall It's a good place.  I would go back.  It's halal  and  that is hard to come by sometimes so alhamdulillah."}
{"text":"Best Arabic food in town. I like to order their plates because their rice is delicious. Everything is great here. Would recommend chicken shawarma the most as that's my go to."}
{"text":"Incredible food, great, relaxed environment!  Friendly and fast service!  Can't wait to visit again"}
{"text":"The lunch specials are divine and hummus is fresh and delicious. I like to get the $5.99 lunch special, the gyro with a side of salad and I usually ditch the pita bread. It's a good amount of food, with or without the pita to fill you up. They don't skimp on the sauce nor the meat. Service for me has always been fast."}
{"text":"I eat here as much as I can.  Recently, I have been dealt some health issues.  I clearly earn them and had to make some serious decisions in how I eat in order to remain healthy and around to see my children grow up.  I feared all my favorite places to eat were going to he a thing of the past...I was wrong, not only was I wrong.  I was pleased to know that while changing to be a vegan I was still able to go to one of my favorite places to eat.  Flaming Kabob was not only staying in my eating rotation.  I was pleased to know that so many dishes were still on the menu for me to eat healthy.  I didn't know there were that many vegan options in mediterainan food.  But now I do and have been taking food to go on those lazy days I am not on the road with work.  Thank you Flaming Kabob and I promise you won't be disappointed especially if you are eating healthy!!"}
{"text":"Super authentic. They make the rice how I love it and I don't even like rice. I did a traditional maza plate plus chicken schwarma and kibbe balls....all perfect. Delivered quickly. Tip the gentleman well :)"}
{"text":"I went here with a large group of friends from church.  They served us all the same meal and told us a little bit about the food that we had eaten.   They served us a salad and pita bread with humus.  Both very tasty.  I love some good humus and good, this was.  For the main course, they served us rice with raisins, chicken kabob, and meat which was lamb and beef together.  They only had a couple of servers that evening, but I felt that they did a very good job of handling our large group.  It was very good, and I would definitely go back and try them again."}
{"text":"Have been coming here with friends for several years!  DELICIOUS and ridiculously affordable sandwich lunch specials around five bucks.  I always get the falafel sandwich and they let me substitute the tahini for tzatziki, my absolute favorite.  Mango smoothies are delicious and huge for the price.  Fries are thick-cut and yummy.  Lentil soup is also a great choice when you need something to warm your stomach up.   Great atmosphere, clean place, convenient location on Baseline, and friendly service!  Come here, you won't be dissapointed!!"}
{"text":"The food itself is really good but honestly this location is very run down and super slow in service.  If you are not getting a quick lunch menu item you will wait around an hour and a half for lunch!  There is normally two maybe three people helping people which isn't many considering the place can seat 75 people probably but I've noticed that most people order to go and pick their food up"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a delicious lunch here last week. The service was great and the meat (lamb) shawarma was delicious. The owner, Kalihil was very engaging, explain the difference in his Jordanian style of preparation. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few years. Food is absolutely spot on. Delicious authentic Mediterranean at its finest. The service can be a little spotty at times, but that's not a huge deal to me. As long as the food is A+ but I know not everyone is like that."}
{"text":"Walking in I was surprised to see the decor I think it was an old dennys diner. It's a little rum down but the music was festive.  The salad had a little too much oregano but the dressing was great.  The chicken lemon soup was delicious and all of the meats were seasoned perfectly the garlic sauce was good but not as much garlic as I expected."}
{"text":"Good middle Eastern food - make sure you check the chalk boards before ordering. Many items are discounted -  IF you order the specials instead of from the menu.  The only negative is the bathroom in summer - like 105deg in  (but the restaurant has Ac)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I walked in here and took several minutes looking at the menu. It was a difficult decision with so many great dishes to choose from. On the wall they had several specials written out, one in particular looked great which was a tomato based lamb stew. Sorry I couldn't remember the exact name..  I'll tell you that I have been to many middle eastern establishments in a number of places, like San Francisco, San Diego, New York, Seattle, etc.. And this is right up there in terms of flavor. Everything tasted extremely fresh, the lamb was so tender and the flavor of the sauce was out of this world. The rice that came with the dish was not just a bowl of rice, it had various spices and almonds which brought out more flavors from the main dish.  It also came with two pita's, I had ordered some more pita to go which cost only $1.50 and it came with six full size pitas that I used at home in a dish I made for dinner. I gobbled up the entire plate of food and cannot wait to come back to try more of their dishes.  I really have to admit that the best places that I have eaten at are not the typical fancy, pretentious looking restaurants. Judging from the outside only, it looks like a dump. Maybe that is to keep traffic down because they have such good food? Who knows. But I do know that I will be back and look forward to the next visit.  Go in there with an open mind and you will not be let down. Keep in mind that this isn't taco bell or chick-fil-a, so take your time with the menu and allow yourself to relax enough to enjoy this amazing cuisine."}
{"text":"Sup, peeps! This place is the awesome. Moved in the neighborhood about 2 months ago and hit that place up about once a week or so. Sure it looks like an old school diner. Sure it's a little warm inside on hot summer days. The place is clean, service is cool and the food is the bomb. Faint of heart? Start with the lunch special. (:"}
{"text":"We recently called from the office for delivery from Flaming Kabob... and that was a flaming mistake.  The pitas were pita-ful, the 'fresh' juices a watery mess, and the fries were actually melted into their plastic container.  I have no experience of eating inside the restaurant and am unlikely to do so after this disaster."}
{"text":"The Flaming Kabob is NOT the place to go for good Middle Eastern Food. The food is just barely a notch above shopping mall food. My Gyro was just average. The fries were 1/2 hot & 1/2 cold. My wife's Greek salad was limp. The waitress came to our table exactly zero times after serving us our food.  If you want GREAT Middle Eastern food then make the 3 mile drive to Phonecia!! If you can't afford the gas money then stay here.  Your call."}
{"text":"Great price!! And the owner so friendly! We got a bunch to go boxes! $39 for a combo for two plus an appetizer. They were fast too! Lamb kebab was #1!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a craving for Middle Eastern food. I checked on Yelp and found this place where our friends could meet us halfway. They bailed, but we went ahead and enjoyed a delicious meal.  It was a bit strange to be eating in an old 5 and Diner restaurant. None of the ambiance was changed except for the addition of the TV and water pipes lining the wall. We were there for the food. We started off with the Baba Ghannoughe. The pit bread was okay and the Baba Ghannoughe was oily but edible.  My wife ordered a cup of Lintel soup with her Chicken Sharawma sandwich. The soup was excellent and she ordered a bowl to go which looked like a cup instead of a bowl.  Her sandwich was okay...we got spoiled at Sabuddy when it was in Tempe and and then in Scottsdale, their sandwich was in the pocket of the pita bread and not wrapped like a burrito. I ordered the Shish Kafta which was 3 pieces of ground beef and lamb char-broiled with a side of onions & tomato and white rice topped with currant raisins. The meat was cooked just right...firm & flavorful and the rice was okay. It's a good thing I didn't eat lunch 'cause there were good portions on my plate. We topped it off with Baklava...mmmm...so good."}
{"text":"DO NOT LET THE OUTSIDE FOOL YOU!! I was really leery as we pulled into the parking lot about 6pm.... not many cars (maybe 2) but my husband said they had really great \"Yelp\" reviews and that I have said many times that \"Yelp\" hadn't failed in the past. So I went for it!!! We had the flaming kabob platter for two and it was delicious! Came with the freshest most tastiest hummus and nann that I ever had! The food was so plentiful that we had leftover for the next nights dinner. I will definately go back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Where to start.   Me and my Fiance have been to this restaurant several times. She was on the hunt for a good vegetarian meal after her favorite place (Doobys) went out of business.   The food here is mediocre. She never has been overly happy with the her meal. I usually get the chicken kabob, the chicken is tasty, however the other items in the meal are inconsistent (sometime I get tomatoes and peppers, sometimes just peppers, sometimes some lettuce, etc.)   The biggest let down is the extremely sub-par service. The last time we went to eat here the waiter got both our orders wrong, and out drink order was not correct. There was only one waiter to service three small tables and two large groups, so being attended to was not timely. There were other employees behind the counter, but they would not help out. It was extremely frustrating. They tried to give us a free desert (that had been sitting in the display cabinet most likely all day.)Everytime we have eaten here it is the same old story about the service. We will not be patronizing this restaurant any longer and will find somewhere else that carries similar food."}
{"text":"Very good, authentic Mediterranean fare. They also have great lunch specials - entire vegetarian platter (hummus, baba ganoush, tabouli and dolmades and two pitas) for $7.99, can't beat that! I also tried a few of their french fries and they were delicious!  Otherwise, it was a bit slow on the service but a nice place to eat. I will definitely go back here again!"}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious.  How do I know?  I always split the dinner for two combo which has an incredible amount of food, and a huge variety of their offerings.  We always take 2 boxes full home in leftover.  Everything in that platter is delicious.  Their meats are incredibly juicy.  Their kibbee (king of like a hush puppy with moist ground beef inside) in incredible.  Their kafta is so moist and flavorful.  The salad has a simple but delicious oil & vinegar dressing with some herbs in it.  The rice has raisins and cashews which is unique too.  The food could easily feed 3, maybe 4.    Very friendly staff, good service and good food are all I need.  This is another one of the very tasty Middle Eastern restaurants in Tempe and it is just as good as the other well known ones in the area."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of arab food but Flsming Kabob has changed my mind! The best arab food in Phoenix. The rice is amazing.The owner is super friendly and welcoming. Plus it's right by ASU so it's very convenient!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place because of the reviews.  They are not wrong the food was great.  And the service was very friendly and quick.  Will be back."}
{"text":"The gyro sandwich is delicious. And I'm not usually a fan of falafel, but theirs is great! The only thing I didn't really like was the hummus, which is creamy like mayo... Great service. Too bad I don't live on this side of town."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. The interior could be worked on though. I was expecting low quality food but it did surprised me. I got the chicken kabob sandwich ASU lunch special with good fries."}
{"text":"The only time I've actually been here I didn't get anything. But then I came to find out that they had catered some food for an occasion.  I'll be straight with you. Their 'flaming kabob' or whatever is amazing. Seriously, its a visual piece of art. I aspire to have sear marks like they do on their kabobs when I grill. I'm not kidding each kabob is visually appealing, has perfect sear marks, and looks like a clone of its brother. They also taste very good, perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of spices. However, for some reason every time I get to try their kabobs, they tend to be a little dry. This could be due to the fact that I always get their kabobs when it is catered at some event. I won't take off too many points for that, but I can't state that the kabob is perfect for the same exact reason.  The rice and hummus is pretty good as well. I'm not really into ride personally, but their yellow raisin rice is quite fantastic. When you couple it all with some hummus, everything sticks together well to complete the meal. I'd say its well worth a try.  Since I have been there once, but eaten the food many times, I will note that the place lacks decent decorations and has average service. That shouldn't take away too much from the experience though."}
{"text":"I thought this place was very good and considering we WERE going to go to the Persian Room, that's saying allot! There was only one waiter for the place and he was not the most pleasant, but he was quick responsive. Just wish he would have written the cost of the sodas on the tab. Nit-picking aside, this place was great, my boyfriend and i shared a combo plate and were both pretty full afterward. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We stopped here by chance, and I was hoping for some good food. Instead, I would say that this restaurant was fantastic! The women wore head scarves which I took as a great sign (down home cooking) and I was not disappointed. We ordered the combo for 2 (a steal at 24.99). A huge green Salad and hummus with pita were brought first; both were delicious. Next was the plate with everything else; kibbeh, beef and chicken kifteh, beef and chicken kabob, chicken shawarma, falafel and grape leaves. It wAs all tender, flavorful, and absolutely delicious. I wish we had one on the Westside of town!!! Highly recommend this restaurant for a fresh and very delicious change."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim.  I was seriously needing a Mediterranean/Greek food fix.  This place is in an old silver diner, (like an old Denny's retro restaurant) so we were a little leery, however, This.Place.Is.Amazing.    We started with a small Hommus (fed 3 of us easily), and a 6pc Falafel.  Both were flavorful.  The Falafel was excellent flavor, not too grainy.  My 9 year old ate 3 of them.  We all opted for the lemon rice chicken soup.  Go for it.  You will NOT be disapppinted.  I had the Gyro Plate.  I wondered  where it had been my whole life.  A nice quantity of gyro meat, some sliced onion and tomato, and a huge serving of rice.  You get one full pita, but I tear mine up and eat with the meat.  Oh, ask for the hot sauce.  It's a vinegary, red, hot sauce, but it is SO Good.  Add the Tatziki sauce to calm the heat a little, and welcome to heaven on a plate.  The 9yo had the Mixed Grill.  A beef kavob, a chicken kabob and a Kafta.  Seriously, the Kafta stole this show.  My 9yo said he was going to order JUST the Kafta next time.  The beef was seasoned splendidly.  Nothing that was overly powerful, just a really good flavor.  This dish also comes with rice or fries.    The husband had the stuffed lamb.  He ate every speck of meat on the plate.  I'm not a huge fan of lamb, but the bite I did have was very flavorful, and really, if you didn't know, it could pass for beef.  Not like any lamb I have had before!  This is a little family owned place, and it is phenomenal.  Don't be scared of the food.  If you've never tried Mediterranean food, The Flaming Kabob is a great choice."}
{"text":"Wait- how have I not reviewed this place yet???  I LOVE THIS PLACE!  I can't say it enough- I freaking LOVE this place. My entire family does- we get out here for dinner whenever we can, and it NEVER fails to disappoint. Everything on their menu is delicious- I've tried a lot of different items and I've always had a big smile on my face. Usually when I come here with the family we just get the family platter and split it, then take the leftovers home.   I've also gotten the family platter for takeout when I needed to feed a bunch of people at events. Every time I do everyone comments on how good the food is.   Their fattoush is really standout- I've never been much for salads, but this one could make me a believer. Their hummus is creamy and the portion is really large. And the meats.... aaaaahhhhhh, the meats!!!! Grab a piece of pita, a dollop of hummus, and a handful of meat, and you've got yourself some memories in the making!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I got the $5.99 Gyro Special (Gyro, fries and a drink) and my husband got the $15 Grill Mix (Salad, soup, two kabobs and a sausage). The food was delicious and fairly priced, and the service was great! The chef and server were a father-and-son team, and I appreciate family businesses.   We'll definitely come back! My husband wants to try a hookah pipe next time."}
{"text":"Honestly They don't even deserve 1 star... A couple years ago I lived next door to this place and I frequented it with my daughter the service was great and I felt appreciated as a customer. .. Fast Fwd yo present day I take my fiance to this place with my daughter in tow thinking we would get the same great service... I was wrong the server was rude and acted as if taking our order was an inconvenience.  He acted as if he didn't understand what I wanted. My fiance ordered for me and my order still came out wrong. Also the portion size of the food is a joke... In order to get full I would of had to order double the food... My daughter literally got 5 chicken nuggets and 8 fries that were extremely crispy. My daughter got a fountain drink with her order and just wanted pink lemonade I asked if she could get a root beer on her refill and I was told she would have to pay for another drink..  refills are free on fountain drinks... I was just disappointed in a place that I thought was going to have good service :("}
{"text":"You know, this is a hole in the wall, but the flavors here are superior to many Middle Eastern restaurants.  The kafta is great, and it's all about the taste, right?  I don't often stop by because honestly the inside seating isn't the most comfortable (the Mesa/Baseline location is better), but I'm here to tell you that your taste buds will be happy here and that the cook knows what he is doing.  Given their location, I am guessing that they would do good late-night business if they decided to go that way-----their flavors are certainly better than most late-night options."}
{"text":"Me and the family go here at least every 2 weeks to get some of their delicious Gyros, they have a gyro special every day and for the price you get plenty of food. very good service also, the decor is a little weird because this location used to be a 5 and diner, also if it's slow time of day it's really quiet in the place no music in the background so it feels kinda strange. but damn I love their gyros."}
{"text":"Had dinner here one Saturday evening before going to a show at the Improv. It is a dive-y little place, which is fine with me, just know what to expect. Service was a little slow considering there were 3-4 parties dining. I had the gyro plate with fries and my friend had a platter with lentil soup. She seemed to enjoy it, my meal was good though not the greatest gyro I've ever had. Probably won't return"}
{"text":"FUCKING AMAZING!  I was driving about Tempe hungry as hell when I spotted this place and figured I'd give it a try.   Damn this was one of the best decisions I made all week.   Started with the soup. It had chicken, rice, and some lemon in it. Very good and helped clear up my sinus.   Then onto the shish kabob plate cooked medium. The meat literally is on par with some of the high end steak houses I've been to. Straight melted in my mouth.   It also came with the really good rice topped with golden raisins. The white sauce and pita was also really good.   Then of course my fat ass had to get the baklava and it was dank as hell.   Go here if you're in Tempe and love yourself. If not you're fucking up."}
{"text":"The service is great! They all are very welcoming and if the owner is available he takes the time to to come to the table and say hello. The food is great and always a friendly environment. Very well mannered."}
{"text":"A-OK. That's the description for 3 stars. It was a solid place, good food, but I can't say it was my favorite Middle Eastern restaurant or had the best chicken shawarma I've ever had. The prices were great, and the hummus was delicious, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. It was conveniently located across the street from the Improv where we were going to see some comedians. That's probably what I appreciated most about Flaming Kabob."}
{"text":"I have come to Flaming Kabob several times for lunch with my co-workers. The service here is really good. The food leaves something to be desired.  The gentleman who hosted us was very respectful. He kept his distance and let us chat, but was sure to come by every now and again to check up on us. You can pretty easily tell that this restaurant was something else before Flaming Kabob, like a diner or fast food joint of some kind. I think the interior and exterior could definitely use an upgrade to match the style of food.  Speaking of food--it is very inexpensive. This is a good selling point. One time, however, I ordered a gyro with the house soup. It was AWFUL. Wayyyyy tooooo much salt, they definitely didn't taste it or I got the bottom of the batch. It destroyed my pallet to the point where I could barely taste the gyro that I usually enjoy. Gonna definitely stick with fries next time. Other places like Flaming Kabob are a bit more put together and the meats taste more moist and fresh.  All in all, I'd come here again if my co-workers ever want to, however I'd never suggest this place if we were deciding where to go."}
{"text":"I'll start with the not-so-bad: the food was fine. I shared the shawarma and gyro - they weren't spectacular, or great, but fine. But if you really want to try the food, I'd recommend takeout or delivery, since the service and environment really ruined the experience for me.  We went on a warmer night, and the dining room wasn't noticeably air conditioned. They had the door propped open, but it was still pretty warm inside. We were the only ones in the restaurant, but the food didn't come particularly quickly (maybe they were working on takeout orders as well?). We'd only had our food for a couple of minutes when our meal was interrupted by a pretty big moth, which had flown in through the open door. Our server started swatting at the moth with a rag, hitting the fans when it flew toward the light bulbs. As he swatted the fans, we could literally see dust falling from the fan blades. This went on for maybe 5 minutes, during which he stood on chairs and tables, and we stood outside and waited. Eventually he killed the moth, apologized briefly, and we didn't see him again until he brought the check. Frankly, it was hard to think about the food after that, and I wouldn't have been surprised if our meal had been complimentary.  Obviously, some aspects of the meal were anomalies, but some of them were pretty alarming regardless - things like falling dust, standing on tables, and rags being used for... well... not cleaning. Unfortunately, the food wasn't good enough to redeem the experience. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food here. It's not like your typical Mediterranean food that has been completely Americanized. Great service and great food. Give it a try, we always get the House tray."}
{"text":"The hummus is to die for, the lunch gyro and fries is the best.  I've been going here since a little after they opened and the owner is a great guy, the staff it friendly, and the food is always top notch."}
{"text":"We used the Yelp app to order delivery from the Flaming Kabob. The estimate was for about an hour delivery. We ordered one of the 2 person combo meals. The food showed up right on time and there was an impressive amount of food. I can't even tell you everything that was in the combo; stuffed grape leave, beef and chicken kabobs, other chicken and beef, the rice was amazing. The pits and hummus was good as well. The only thing that was disappointing was the accompanying salad. The salad seemed like it was an afterthought, I didn't mind so much as there was plenty of other food. On the other hand my girl was not to happy about it.   We will be ordering again"}
{"text":"The waiter was terribly rude. Food is good though. He outright swore at me because I spoke to him while he was calculating our check up at the register (when I saw him over-calculate something during the adding up process) and he lost his place. It's remedial fucking math. Still tipped the scrub $2. Avoid eating dine-in. He also refused to take my order over the phone to have it ready ahead of time so I can eat there unless I tipped him $10."}
{"text":"Giving it 5 stars because the service was outstanding! The girl that works there is extremely courteous and mindful.    Two days ago, I ordered the mixed grill and it was great especially the lamb chunks.  The chicken was a bit dry but still good...wish it was a bit more juicer. Lentil soup was also very good.  Bottom line, not bad for Mesa! I'm visiting from the DC area so am used to some great Kabob places/food.  This is a must visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Not only was the waiter friendly and quick to get my order, the Food WAS AMAZING. A little bit pricey, but you know what you are paying for when you take that first bite."}
{"text":"The food here is very good. I've gotten take out and eaten in the restaurant and both experiences have been enjoyable. The service in the restaurant is great. I have no idea what the people are talking about when they say the servers are bad. Ours was very kind and had lots of conversation with my boyfriend and me. He also gave us some extra food to try some stuff out! We have gotten the dinner for two both times and it has been more than enough food, especially for the price. It looks kind of like a dump from the outside, but the food is actually really good!  For the take out food we called and they said it would only take about 20 minutes to cook our food. My boyfriend showed up 20 minutes later and our food was ready to go. It was all wrapped up and warm. There was no problems at all and we had just as much food, is not more, than when we dined in."}
{"text":"Best Arabic/Middle Eastern food in the valley!!!  The portions are also HUGE and price very fair.  Everything is great, and I am picky so that says something about this place.    The atmosphere is VERY casual, used to be a 5 and diner - obviously.  The service is great.  Even if it weren't, I wouldn't care because the food is great ;)"}
{"text":"Lentil soup was really good, rice was great, grilled kabobs were tender with great flavor. Hummus was creamy with great flavor. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean food in the valley and the best owner. I got turned onto the Flaming Kabob from a work colleague who used them for catering and suggested I give them a shot.   Now I cater lunches for work daily and kind of expect to be let down when you order a mass of food...not here!   I always order the chicken kabobs, rice salad and hummus and it is amazing everytime! Khalil the owner is one of the nicest most accommodating people I have met. He makes his orders on time and is fair priced. Plus the food is delicious!   If you are looking to support a local business and are in the mood for Mediterranean make sure you even go out of your way to go to the Flaming Kabob!"}
{"text":"Flaming Kabob is absolutely delicious. The meal was very fresh and flavorful. My friends and I come here all the time to get a late night dinner. Food and service has never failed. The service is fantastic. I strongly recommend this restaurant in you are in the valley"}
{"text":"the food was good and the prices were very affordable for a family of four, we had a full meal and had leftovers for next day lunch all for a combo that they say feeds two but we where hungry ate well and had food to spare for next day's lunch costing us aboiut $35,  a great value."}
{"text":"Myself and my boyfriend both ordered gyros and they were amazing. The lamb was tender and the tzatziki sauce perfect. Was full after just one gyro, no appetizers etc needed. Psst...Also they run a daily special now that is buy one gyro get one gyro free!   Ended up taking some hummus and pita bread to go and that was our dinner! Very filling."}
{"text":"Food has always been great, but they just jacked up their prices by 25% and got rid of their lunch menu.  Sandwich special is now $7.41.  Lunch entrees are now $11+.   Value is gone.  I'll be hitting up Gyro House from now on."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a very long time and absolutely love it. The hostess is amazing and the food is great. The kibba is the real deal here not dry at all. We definitely recommend this place over a few others in the area."}
{"text":"Shared the combo for two. So much food and it was all great. The shish kabob ordered medium rare was probably the standout. Topped with tzatziki it was phenomenal. $25 and it easily fed my wife and I with leftovers. Server was very nice and attentive.   Atmosphere is super interesting. The building seemed to be a diner before, which I feel like made the whole experience more authentic. You can tell it was a small business working with what they could find and focusing on a good product.  They also have a deal for a gyro or other sandwich with a side and drink for about $8. If it is anything like the food we had it is definitely worth stopping in on your lunch break for that deal."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food I've found since moving here from Europe (yes, it's not abundant in AZ at all). Service was quick and friendly, and the serving sizes were huge. The Greek salad was amazing, and the gyros was the best. The former 5 & Diner decor was a bit odd, but I suppose it doesn't matter with food this good."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, but the food was good and inexpensive for this type of thing. The counter guy was pretty new, learning the job, but he did a decent job. It took a little while for the food to come, but you expect that for the type of food. There were three of us so we tried a pretty good assortment of food, and everyone was pleased.   I'm usually more long winded than this, but what else is there to say? Not a place to take a date, but good, inexpensive, Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Authentic delicious and amazing customer service! There gyros remind me of the first gyro I ever had which started my love for trying new food."}
{"text":"The ambience is a bit strange, being in an old diner, but it was very good Middle Eastern food. While it tends to be a bit pricey, the portions are huge. We ate there for dinner and had more than enough for dinner the following night. Especially try the hummus, which is excellent. The fallafels have a unique, spicy kick that's pretty tasty as well. Excellent chicken shawerma, too."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a late lunch/early dinner on Christmas Day. Food was delicious and portions were huge."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and was given an ETA of 45 to an hour. The delivery driver finally showed up nearly 2 hours later with cold food. We ordered a Gyro platter with fries and some hummus. Hummus was spilled all over the bag. The gyro was slimy and cold due to the time spent in the drivers car I'm assuming. There's a lot of great middle eastern in Tempe. Don't waste your money at Flaming Kabob."}
{"text":"Good food! Fast and friendly service! Get the combo for two, great deal! The rice and hummus and kabobs all on point. Meat is tender and moist. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I was starving so I gave in and decided to check this place out. Small place, nothing special inside (which really does not bother me) but good service. The hummus was very good and the pita bread tasted very fresh. They do have a very large menu and prices are very decent as well considering the large portions. My entree was meh- like I said I was starving so it did the job. No alcoholic beverages of any sort. Entree did come with either soup or salad (large salad) and either rice or fries. Had the rice and salad which were both alright.   I did leave with leftovers but couldn't tell you if it was because i was just too full or my taste buds just weren't really diggin' what I was throwing in there.   Heard about it, tried it, don't have it down in my datebook as of now to head back."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the $10 Chicken Kabob meal.  I love the rice and the mint salad.  The chicken is done just right and always tastes good."}
{"text":"Another Detroit/Dearborn transplant here in search of that elusive good middle eastern food in a sea of tacos,chimi's chipolte... I think i finally found it in Flaming Kabob.. After being disappointed by Haji Baba's food (the store is preemo) i did a standard search and came across Flaming K. i ordered chicken kabob..the garlic sauce was soooo good..chicken was tender perfectly seasoned .. I cant wait to go back and try everything else."}
{"text":"I've driven past Flaming Kabob a lot in my new neighborhood and the diner exterior definitely makes me laugh...but I laugh at a lot. I've never been inside there but I've ordered delivery from them 3 times now and each time I've been very pleased. My favorite is the Gyro Sandwich. It is ridiculous good!! The hummus and falafel and pita bread are super tasty as well. The rice is good, raisins aren't my thing so I picked them out but I've really enjoyed eating here and will continue to do so. I will say that they take a bit too long on the delivery, last time they called me to say they didn't have the soda I ordered and by the time they called me the food was already supposed to be here, and then there GPS took them to the wrong place but it was pouring rain so I forgave them. The food REALLY makes up for it and I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean food in the valley. Everything on the menu is delicious and relatively inexpensive. They have everything middle eastern. They are also really nice and chill. Really loved all of the offerings, and honestly, I have no idea what they were called either! The hummus was delicious and the grilled flavored are on point. The owners/staff are very nice and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Oh my Greek! My husband and I love The Flaming Kabob! So much that we've ordered it twice in one week via Postmates!   There is a great selection, the portions are large, price is good and the food is addicting. My husband and I love to eat and we can eat a lot! Sharing the gyro platter is enough for us (with extra pita). The platter comes with tons of meat, lots of rice (or fries) and soup (or salad)!   The service is great too. We called the wrong location once and they even called us back to make sure we got to the right place. Totally unnecessary but very much appreciated!   If you're craving Greek go to the Flaming Kabob. You'll be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"I am originally from the middle east, i'd like to eat middle eastern food once in a while, but it seems theres no good middle eastern food here in Phoenix area, i ordered fried kebbe and gyro sandwich, the kebbe tasted like it was frozen since the ice age and suddenly fried in a hot oil, the gyro was ok, but not as i expected."}
{"text":"I ate in this restaurant couple times. I have never enjoyed the meal before. But let's skip that, I want to tell you about last night's experience.   Last time I ate there was maybe a year ago and I was witnessed last night that they were consistent about the poor quality of food and service over years. I was there last night and hoping something has changed also I had no other option at that moment.   I have ordered new york steak with fries side, I have also ordered lentil soup, the soup was average quality but the steak was horrible, I have ordered well done but they did it well well well done and finally it was burned. It's taste was also terrible. They put fries next to the steak and all water of the steak was all over the fries. I couldn't even eat most of the fries.   Let me tell you about our server. He asked me that what I would like to drink and as a normal customer I said sprite and my friend ordered ice tea. When he came back he said here is your sprite and when I taste that \"sprite\" I thought this should be a new version of sprite and finally we could think that maybe he mixed the cups. That's all right, I am not that cruel, but other thing is that he asked me 3 times about how i would like to steak cooked and I told him 3 times \"well done\". Final product was a burned steak.   My friend order gyro and he didn't like it either.  Overall that was a horrible experience. I am surprised that how this business is still on the market after that poor quality over the years. I strongly recommend that stay away from this restaurant, there are a lot of good places to go and this place is not even close to those good places."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite resturant in Tempe! The service is great and the food is even better!! Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent very fresh and hit when served.   The kabobs are excellent and and not filed with more vegetables than meat like other places.   The tra tastes like it Yes fresh brewed."}
{"text":"First trip and will be last. We stopped in for dinner to go this past weekend. Service was fast and friendly, the food was only average. The meat was very dry and relatively flavorless. I would not order from Flaming Kabob again."}
{"text":"The food and the customer service were great! We were looking for dinner a little late and came across this place as it is super close to our house and we love supporting local businesses. We are SO glad we found this place! The customer service is amazing as is the food! We had a feast of schwarma and gyros and we were left satisfied and full! We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for two years and I can't believe that I am just now writing a review.  Every time I come I am greeted with a smile.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.  The food is fresh and healthy.  Super inexpensive.  My favorite is the lemon rice soup. I also love their gyros, full of flavor.  The stuffed grape leaves are to die for.  The food is filling.  They deliver and are open late."}
{"text":"I always love eating here. The service is fast and friendly. The food is always delicious. They really know how do Mediterranean food. I always get the Gyros platter with greek salad and grape leaves."}
{"text":"got the lunch special. nothing special about it. pita and french fries were store bought. I asked for no onions and guess what I got. would not go there again."}
{"text":"I just made a Yelp account to forewarn anyone who orders from here. The food is NOT good. The gyros have 3 scraps of lettuce in them with maybe 4 little pieces of meat with no sauce. The fries are the chunky doughy flavorless kind no one likes. My boyfriend ordered a shake that tasted like dirt ~ I guessed it was some kind of mint or green tea before he told me it was strawberry, banana and orange."}
{"text":"Giving it 4 stars because the inside and outside need maintenance and lack ambience. But do not be mistaken, the food is 10 star. Everything is delicious. If the deco could match the food & the music, this place would an unmatched gem!"}
{"text":"The owner and employees make you feel right at home, the food is delicious and service is so fast.. The meals are extremely affordable, portion sizes are very generous and the restaurant itself is very clean, pleasant and peaceful! Please check it out! You'll be happy you did!! :)"}
{"text":"Four stars base on the food alone. I thought the food was excellent and am looking forward to going back to try the gryos.  I am not a fan of the restaurant. I think that the seating could be a lot more comfortable. The only option was a counter or booths. The table was a little sticky and I am sure it is because of the age. This place used to be a 5 & Diner. I wish they would remodel the inside so the restaurant was as good as the food. I will still go back!"}
{"text":"The food here is GREAT! I love their gyros. Not the most decorative, as it used to be a diner, but the service was awesome."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Flaming Kabob! We can't believe that the place is usually almost empty. It makes no sense to us. The food is so amazing. I love the chicken shwarma wrap. Chicken is not supposed to taste this good. My wife loves their salads. I can't think of another restaurant that we are so passionate about. The owner knows us and is very nice."}
{"text":"Went here as a first timer. The reviews are spot on. Food was good and man, a lot of it! Go hungry or be sure to take some home.  The service was fine, but I think they must have hired a new waitress or she got the message from Sophia F.'s comment. The waitress was all alone but managed about 20 guests well. Very friendly and accommodating. My wife and I will definitely return as we both want to try more stuff. My wife had the Gyro sandwich and I had the Gyro platter. Very good."}
{"text":"Food good.  Soda/water warm (you gotta add ice)  Restaurant dirty (you gotta clean the place...if the bathroom is dirty, I don't even what to know what the kitchen looks like)  Clean the place and it might be a 3 to a 4."}
