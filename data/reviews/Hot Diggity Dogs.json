{"text":"The Nathan'a beef dog was very tasty topped with their coney sauce.  I would recommend the dog, but the restaurant is largely carryout. I would rate it higher if it was more comfortable to dine in."}
{"text":"Food was gross chili tasted bland and i couldn't even finish my food i do not recommend this place try scooters if you really want a hotdog place"}
{"text":"I love a good hot dog but hate when a place only offers one or two variations. Well this place there's almost 20 ways to get one. Looks like I will be back at least 19 more times"}
{"text":"This place has great dogs. It has tons of variety and the staff is great. Some think it got worse when the original owner left, but this is not my experience. The new owner is bending over backwards to make her customers happy. If you don't like the Nathan's dogs she has other types. She carries corn dogs as well since it was asked for. If you have a special request for a dog or how it is to be made, they have no problems handling those. You almost can't go wrong with any dog on the menu and the fries are handcut and come in huge sizes. Don't order the large fry unless you have a couple of friends to share it with. Do go here. Don't expect elegant dining. Do expect great food."}
{"text":"Worst Chicago dog ever. Won't go there again. If I want a dog again, I'll go to Scooters."}
{"text":"Best fries ever, great selection of hot dogs, good service too.  They get you in and out and the food is very very good. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"What-the-hell-happened!  It appears the place has been taken over by a new owner who has changed the menu from hand crafted dog shop to street corner BBQ quick stop! The food quality is poor, the presentation is careless and the whole experience was nothing as the previous owner. The new owner is using ghetto quality food. The previous owners Chicago was built on the right bun for starters. The poor boy was drenched in BBQ sauce and I couldn't pick it up to eat. They said the ice machine was broke and I would bet it's been this way for weeks. The place is not what you expected and the only thing that is the same is the sign. Stay away folks. I would bet the food is bought at Food stamp crowd stores. Horrible."}
{"text":"I've had better hot dogs, but this place was pretty good. I love loaded dogs ... dogs with all kinds of funky things on them so I was super pumped to try this place. We were greeted at the door by a very friendly staff. They helped us figure out what to order. I tried their hot / spicy dog and fries. The fries were fantastic and the dog was good.   Why not great?? They didn't put enough stuff on them. Sad to say... There was supposed to be spicy BBQ sauce on it and I couldn't taste anything. Bummer.  I'll go back and try again and if they serve the same, I'll probably suggest this to the person in charge. If I'm spending $5 on a single dog, it's gotta be loaded."}
{"text":"Jumping right in on this one. Want a hot dog? Make one yourself at home. I guaranteed the time that your spend on the couch watching your favorite show and boiling up a few hotdogs and that .89 cent pack of hotdog buns you invested in, will be worth the extra time that you spend hunting around your refrigerator and cabinets for some extra special kick ass ingredients to your liking. Compared to tossing $6 to the wind and watching it roll away when you could have done so much more with $6.   Bottom line, this place is a joke and I don't need to eat another one to confirm it. Here's what happened: upon looking at a menu that an unnamed person printed out ( I ain't gon say no names)  I was not impressed at all. H.D.D. You really need to revamp your menu. Yeah it's cool to have a lot of varieties and all that but if you're claiming you have the best of something make sure it's the best of something. Don't tell me I'm getting a \"Chicago\" dog and it's really a Willoughby dog. Rename it and recreate it because that is NOT a Chicago anything.   Next; to each it's own but me personally, I rather not see crushed up chips on the menu as a topping for my hot dogs. Really? My first impression is lazy and ghetto. For example, I saw a \"paper\" flier advertising hot dogs for Cinco de Mayo. How about you try; con queso cheese sauce, chorizo, fresh salsa, jalapeño relish and avocado? (Sorry if I copied of someone but literally just came up with that from the tip of my taste buds.) Instead, crushed up nachos and salsa were the toppings offered from this establishment. Do you see my frustration? Offer the chips on the side. If you want to continue with that theme here's one, hot dog, plain chips, and a packet of hot sauce. (eye roll) There's a classic, smh this is elementary! Why?  Why am I upset: Because, I wanted to try their Hot Diggity Dog . . . Naturally because it's named after the place so it's got a be good.   This is the Review:   My Hot Diggity Dog was the perfect representation of the place. Honesty. Now, it was my fault, I'll admit, because it was right there on the menu clear as day. \"Pepper jack cheese, mustard and jalapeños\". LITERALLY!!! Imagine my face when I opened the box and saw that shit! White ass cheese with not one red or green pepper flake and if it had them I'm sorry, I didn't see them and four little funky ass pieces of jarred pickled Jalapeños???? Wtf and I guess they said fuck my mustard because I didn't see nor tasted it.  I would rather have six of your greatest hotdogs then to have 31 flavors of bullshit.   In closing: never coming back, I'm posting pics (later, it's 4am right now) so yes I have proof.   But on a good note the people were nice and the naked hot dog itself isn't bad. But that's not enough to go back. Take your $6 to the Happy Dog review coming soon."}
{"text":"Great selection of dogs, even have a turkey option for no extra charge! Place is small but quaint and has no dining area, but on a nice summer night we stopped at some picnic areas just down the road. The Chicago dog was enough for me, the Nathan's frank was super filling and the veggies seemed fresh. He had the large 1/3 footlong of bacon and cheddar. Said it was great but expected melted cheddar on top instead of the shredded variety. Overall we will be back to try others on the menu but will know to call ahead due to the decent wait and make sure it's a nice day to find an outside spot to dine."}
{"text":"Here's the thing: A hot dog needs to be the star of its own show. A big burger can stand up to a lot of accompaniments, even other meats. A dog can handle veggies, cheese, even a thin chili, but that's about it.  So don't offer me a \"Colombian Dog\" with pinapple and crushed potato chips, among lots of other gunk. Don't stick tzatziki and olives on it and call it Greek.   After seeing that menu, I suspected that the Chicago Dog would not live up to the name, and I was right. It didn't have the promised cucumbers, the relish wasn't neon green, and the dog itself was pretty tasteless -- no Vienna here.  We got the fries too. They weren't bad, but not great.  The short dogs, apparently quarter-pounders, were big enough to be filling with just one for each of us.   The place was only open a few days when we went there, but still I have to say the service was horrible. Just one order in front of us, and it took forever to get ours. The staff behind the counter was arguing with each other and managed to forget what the first order was; had to redo a dog for them.  No place to sit.  I give it 3 stars only because I realize that as a Chicagoan I have higher standards for hot dogs than most people, so the stuff they serve here might be acceptable in Ohio. But really, you should try something else instead."}
