{"text":"Went to to Anthony's with my best friend on the advice of my Pastor. The atmosphere was very inviting the server was pleasantly helpful. We are from southern Florida so we know a thing or two about Caribbean food. This was not authentic. The owner is from Africa I was told. Nevertheless it was good. The chicken was not jerk but rather a rotisserie style. It was succulent, and to die for good. The plantains were great and the lemonade with lime was so good, I took some to go. The rice on the other hand was not tasty at all. I had to have gravy added to it. I will definitely revisit this place in the future."}
{"text":"This may be the worst take out I've had in Charlotte. Got a chicken ribs combo. The chicken was ok, just absolutely bland and devoid of flavor. The ribs on the other hand are the poorest excuse for pork I've EVER HAD! Though they are virtually devoid of meat, there's plenty of fat and grizzley to make up for it. So greasy, so so greasy. The plantains were dry and textural unappealing. The fries were still raw. I don't mean cold, I mean undercooked. Not sure what kind of cooks they have bit they failed French Fry 101. Overall the best and only good part of the meal was the sauce. So just skip the EXTREMELY subpar food and just get a bowl of sauce. Whoever represents this \"restaurant\" should be ashamed."}
{"text":"This place is some place not to miss out on! The meals are cooked consistently every time. I love the chicken wings, they are delicious , juicy and depending on the sauce can be spicy too! I love the grouper sandwich, such a deal for lunch time and it comes with a side! The Ribs are so tender and you get anywhere from 4 to 5 on the plate with 2 sides. Don't miss out on any soup he makes on certain days, he (the owner) is very good making them. Everything is authentic and he treats all customers like family, welcoming them and making sure he says hi every time he sees you. The staff is great, and don't forget if you ask to get the filtered water, its so clean and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food! Jerk chicken is pretty good! They actually make their own jerk sauce too. Coco bread and beef patty is on point. Rice and peas is great too! Will definitely be back!  Day 2: I made good on my promise, it was soo damn good!! This place is a gem  y'all definitely missing out!"}
{"text":"The servers are really nice.  The food isn't spicy (at all), so if you like your food hot be ready to pay (albeit $0.40) for hot sauce.  Otherwise,  it's good."}
{"text":"Great little spot with some wonderful Caribbean tastes. The jerk chicken wings ade amazing and the service is fantastic!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place. The chicken is very tender and tasty and you have to try a beef patty for an appetizer. Definitely get the Anthony's sauce on the chicken. I have taken many clients here for lunch because it is economical and has a very friendly staff. The sweet tea is fresh but not too sweet.   I wholly recommend this restaurant for everyone."}
