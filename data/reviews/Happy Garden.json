{"text":"A friendly family-run take-out Chinese restaurant.  Quality is consistent and high because every worker is of the same immediate family.  There is a small dine in area.  Food is tasty, high quality and prepared in a consistent 10 minute time frame.  We go often and have yet to be disappointed.  A great place get dinner or lunch that far outstrips its fast food rivals down the road."}
{"text":"From my experience, Asian take-out places can be hit or miss.  However, I would say that Happy Garden is a definite \"Hit\", and provides good quality & value for your dining dollar.  It's not a fancy-schmancy gourmet asian bistro, but it should definitely be on your radar if you are looking for a decent place to grab some quick take-out.  The restaurant was very clean inside when I visited, the staff friendly & professional, and the food that I received was very hot & fresh tasting.  I had an egg roll and vegetable lo mein, but plan on trying some more of their menu items when I am in the mood for some take-out the next time."}
{"text":"The food was bland and tasteless. The chow mei fun was dry. Singapore chow mei fun had little spice, what it did have came from a few crushed pepper seeds. We were completely and fundamentally disappointed. Our son ordered sesame chicken which was sub par. Again, absolutely NO flavor. The boneless ribs were cooked to death and were tough and dry. The staff did not greet us or return a greeting.   I will NEVER EVER. Waste $40 like that again. If I could give this restaurant a negative score, I would."}
{"text":"Used to have great food and flavor. I've eaten there since they've opened. The past 6 months, though, I've gotten wrong items in my orders (my wife is allergic to shrimp yet she keeps finding shrimp in her orders!!) and the food has been bland bland bland. They don't follow the ingredients on their menu. Very friendly cashier, but their cooks preparing the meals either don't care or don't know what they're doing and I'm guessing no one has complained yet. Don't know if they're trying to cut costs or what. Will not go to Hunan in Medina either, after they insulted my dinner party asking us to leave because they had people waiting for a table when we hadn't even gotten the check yet! Time to look for another Chinese take out..."}
{"text":"found by chance and was surprised how good it was.  it is tucked away in a little plaza and unless you are looking for it you will miss it from the road.  Good food and service."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place is still open...  The pork fried rice was horrible, I'm not even sure that it was pork.  Maybe it was pork, either way I wouldn't have known because there was more fat than meat.  If a chinese place can't do fried rice right, one is left to wonder what they can do right."}
{"text":"Happy Garden has surprisingly fresh tasting food. For my fellow Veg-heads, I'd suggest ordering the Vegetable Delight with a side of garlic sauce. And for the carnivorous beings, I'd recommend not eating meat.... I'm sorry I had to do it :) If you just have to curb that desire I'd go with the sesame chicken, steamed dumplings, crab rangoon or chicken and broccoli (Recommended by my meat eater travel partner)  Take out dine in options  - Visa / Debit / Cash accepted - delivery options - Discont offered if you're staying at Motel 6 - Vegetarian options"}
{"text":"This place has a great $25 combo that we get as take out all the time.   This meals feeds 4 adults and 4 younger kids. They food is normally ready in about 10-15 minutes for pick up.  It's a crowd pleaser at our house."}
{"text":"The rice was great when I was there and so was the rest of my meal. Excellent curry. Excellent egg rolls. A have used Happy Garden for dine in and delivery and have had nothing but good experiences. Best to try it for yourself. Not sure what happened for David there, but you can't judge everything by one experience."}
{"text":"rice was mushy, fried shrimp was dark when I bit into it egg roll was the same way. quit eating it after a few bites and still  woke up sick. would definitely stay away"}
{"text":"When I want Chinese food in Medina I ALWAYS choose Happy Garden.  This family owned place never disappoints. Their food is very tasty and high quality. No matter what time you go it seems like they're able to prepare your food within 10 minutes. Their egg rolls are the best I've ever add from a small place like this; crispy and delicious.   There are a lot of small Chinese restaurants to choose from but those who know, choose Happy Garden!"}
{"text":"We called to order takeout on Friday night. We ordered Broccoli and Chicken and Orange Chicken. When we arrived home the only thing in the bag was the Orange Chicken. I called to let them know what was forgotten and I was instantly turned into a liar. They assured me that I never ordered but yet I paid $19 for Orange Chicken. I have been here many times and have never paid $19 for one meal at a Chinese Restaurant. I really enjoyed take out from here but I will be taking my business else where. Customer service is absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in this plaza. Great Chinese food at a good price! The staff, however, wasn't very forward with the  \"warm n' fuzzy\". But, the food makes up for it.  What's with the attitude in this plaza? Maybe they are getting hostess tips from the \"happy\" bunch at the NY Bagel Deli!"}
{"text":"The General Tso Chicken was just OK. I had the combo. The pork fried rice was cold and tasteless. I grabbed a side of Pineapple Chicken to share. It was not even close. I have a great recipe I should share with them. What ever they might believe is Pineapple Chicken, isn't."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight while I was on a business trip to the area. Ordered the Szechuan Chicken combo and asked for extra spicy. I also got an extra egg roll and hot & sour soup. Although I asked for extra spicy I don't believe they added any spice to it. It was very bland with a sweet taste to it. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give the heat a 1 or lower. The egg rolls were very good, very fresh and the outside was crispy. The fried rice that came with the entree was very bland as well in my opinion. Finally, the hot and sour soup was not spicy or sour at all. Maybe a small hint of sour. The ingredients were fine but the flavor could have been much better. Next time I will try somewhere else when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, much better than all of he other Chinese take out places in Medina. I moved to Medina from Avon almost 3 years ago, and it's taken almost that long to find a Chinese take out restaurant that I've been happy with. Happy Garden has become my go to place now! Only downside is, they don't deliver. Food is still great."}
{"text":"This place actually gets no stars because I called and tried to place a delivery order while at work but the lady told me it needed to be at least 25 and just hung up on me while trying to ask her another question. So I won't be ordering or trying anything from here ever. Poor customer service is a killer."}
{"text":"Owners sister run`s the place now and its terrible. The food has no flavor to it now. I went back 3 times thinking they had a bad night. I was wrong. The food is just nasty. Ive tried to tell her and she thinks your a idiot and is rude. At one time this place was great but no more!"}
