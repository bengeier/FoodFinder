{"text":"Great (gluten free) fish & chips and friendly staff. The mussels are also very good!
I'm happy to have a new quality food spot in the area. Go visit and try them, you'll come back."}
{"text":"You know sometimes you go to a restaurant, the food is good but the service is so meh that you cannot give them the five stars...Well, that was the case here.

I had just picked up my son from school was tired of my long week and wasn't in the mood for cooking so we ended up going to Ad Hoc. When we arrived the two ladies were in the middle of a discussion but invited us to have a seat. The weather was nice, so we wanted to be seated at the window. Then, one of them brought us the menu, with no smile nor hi ... nothing.

She came back a few moments later and then asked us dryly if we were ready to order, I ordered mussels with fries and fish & chips for my son. We were served relatively quickly, the mussels were really good and the proportions were more than generous. My son was also pleased with his dish. However, during all the time we were there not once, she came to ask us if everything was okay, something that she actually did with the other tables. I then asked her for desserts because my son wanted something sweet, she had this annoyed attitude, so much that my 7-year-old, finally told me that he did not want anything and we left.

if the energy put in the food was the same used for welcoming clients, well I would have unhesitatingly put five stars to that place."}

{"text":"Moi et mon copain marchions sur Ontario près de l'heure du souper et nous remarquons alors la super belle façade de Ad Hoc, que je n'avais jamais remarqué auparavant. Nous sommes 2 gars des maritimes, alors nous adorons les Fish & Chips! En regardant le menu de dehors, c'est un peu au dessus de la moyenne de prix d'un Fish & Chips, mais nous prenons la peine d'y entrer, peut-être serons nous surpris.
Très petit, 'cozy' à l'intérieur et très sombre, environ 16 places assises.
On nous remet les menus sans dire bonjour, je demande un verre d'eau, la serveuse roule des yeux....ça commence bien. 
Nous prenons le Fish & Chips, il est ok, sans plus. Pas de WOW dans le goût du poisson, des frites ou de la sauce. 
Il y a beaucoup de compétition sur ces plats à Montréal et il faut être prêt à se différencier des autres restaurants pour pouvoir se faire une place. Malheureusement rien de spécial ici, je n'y retournerai pas."}
