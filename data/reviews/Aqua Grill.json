{"text":"Visited recently. It was actually my 3rd time going. I was glad to see all the tables had people! Good signs. I've been during the week and it's not always busy. But this trip was a Saturday.

Aqua grill always has a great selection of wine, use seasonal vegetables, and has a great variety of fish, bird and game meat.  Lots of gluten-free (GF) marked items too! Their menu seems to change seasonally, so if you fall in love with a dish, get it while they serve it! They also offer lots of specials which is a great bonus!

I recently went for my Mom's birthday. They offer fresh artisan bread at the start of the meal, but nothing that I could have for my GF belly. My parents ordered crab cakes and a fig/arugula salad for appies. They crab cakes looked amazing, apparently tasted great. The salad was fresh and tasty.

Mains. I ordered a dish with shrimp and grilled calamari with the truffle fries on the side. The fries weren't as crispy as one would think, but the parmesan and truffle oil make them decadent. The meal was light and the seafood cooked well. My mom got a seafood type pasta that also came with beef, and my dad ordered a special of their containing homemade noodles, scallops, shrimp and lobster. 

And that's where our only issue arose... our only issue in the collective 7 or 8 times my parents or myself has visited Aqua grill. 

We are a seafood lover family. We have had the worst of the worst, and the best of the best. So my dad, not a very vocal guy when things go wrong, takes a bite of the lobster. Immediately spits it out, very ungallantly, on his side plate. My mom proceeds to smell it - ammonia. That means it's bad, very, very bad. Well, this is where Aqua grill keeps it's 4 stars. The server apologizes profusely, takes the dish off the bill and offers a different main dish free of charge. My dad declines a second dish, as there was still an incredible amount of food on his plate and he was full. He did say in that first bite he was reluctant to spit it out because it was so beautifully poached in butter that the texture was amazing! 

Look, I get it, especially in the winter when fresh seafood is harder to acquire. Seafood may ship frozen, thaw a bit along the lines, and be re-frozen in the restaurants kitchen.  However, we were a little baffled that a restaurant with such a great reputation doesn't continuously test their products/smell along the cooking process. I hope they learned a lesson! But they handled it with class and that's why I'll always recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"My husband and I received a recommendation to eat at Aqua Grill a couple months ago. Since then, we have been there about once a week. Everything that we have ordered has been absolutely delicious. We are especially big fans of the butternut squash ravioli, the chicken was fantastic...well I could list the whole menu, but the point is, you cannot go wrong!  They offer many specials each night which is great because there is always a chance to try something new. The chef has a true gift in the kitchen, his creations are spectacular. The staff is very knowledgeable and never make you feel rushed. A true dining experience. They also serve brunch on Sundays from 11-3 which I highly recommend. Be sure to order the basket of baked goods to start, the scones are to die for!  Aqua Grill has quickly jumped to the top of our list. I'm already dreaming of my next meal there!"}
{"text":"Went to Aqua a couple of years ago with my family and had a pleasant experience. The 'Mom and Pop' owners were very friendly and serve food that is very tasty. The decor is nice, however the area is somewhat small and narrow. Ask for their Specials which are made daily. Not the greatest location for there is a lack of nearby parking, therefore park on Yonge St. Overall, a good meal at a price that leans towards pricey, but still better than most franchises."}
{"text":"I would give this place 2.5 stars.  I came for dinner the other day...ordered the crab cakes, steak, grilled calamari and tiger shrimp.  Everything was ok...asked for med. rare steak...it came out more medium well.  The steak isn't really worth the price at $27.  If this restaurant was in downtown Toronto...it would get slaughtered."}
{"text":"Amazing service. The waitress was well informed and able to give suggestions. 
Food was fantastic. There's just the right amount of selection and variety. Each plate was artfully presented. Dishes were delicious.
Great ambience."}
{"text":"Why this Aurora gem doesn't have other 5star reviews? I don't know, but I can say that everything that we ordered was relish, tiger shrimp delicious Cornish hen was juicy and very well seasoned, even the smoked salmon appetizer was made in house and tasted delicious.. Amazing customer service glad we went there to celebrate a birthday.  You gotta eat here:)"}
{"text":"This was our first time here, the service was professional wine list good. You can tell the food was prepared by a well crafted hand. I had the butternut squash ravioli. Tasty but small portions the t bone was just above average I did like the chanterelles serves with it. I would have liked to taste the wine come through in the sauce."}
{"text":"I have been to Aquagrill 4times it's always very good food and great service. They always have some specials cuts of meat or bison .. I highly recommend if you want to have a dinner for 4 in an intimate settings."}
