{"text":"First time at this restaurant and was very impressed with the service and the excellent food with ample servings. The location is easy with ample parking.  If you are an oriental food lover, this is the place."}
{"text":"Why no love for Rainbow? Went there on a Saturday night at 6:00pm and we were the only guests there! We where there for over an hour too. It is a beautiful atmosphere and decent food."}
{"text":"We tried Rainbow last night. The food was delicious but the service was terrible. If the service had been good I would have rated it 5 stars.  If you are ordering take out - please read below:   I placed the order at 5:25 via the online ordering system. The system-generated pick up time was 6:00. My husband arrived at 5:55 and no one seemed to know about our order. It was not busy - only 5 tables sat.  They eventually located a print out under several other papers on the desk and said it would be 15 minutes. No problem except it wasn't ready for 35 more minutes! That's an hour and 5 minutes for take out.    While he was waiting for the order there was no apology or attempt to make his wait more enjoyable.  While there he witnessed chaos in the dining room - a couple came in and sat at the sushi bar - no one greeted them and they left after 15 minutes - only one waitress on Valentines Day! - loud noises and kids screaming coming from the kitchen area.    The hostess should have brought my husband a drink or discounted the meal.   The food was great but because of the lack of service I doubt we would ever go back.     Spring rolls- good,nice crunch Shrimp tempura roll- perfect Edamame- good but not salted Vegetable Lomein - delicious- great balance of noodle and veggies and not too oily Sesame chicken- very good, came with broccoli which was also good.  Seared pork gyoza- perfect, sauce was also great No fortune cookies- not sure if they forgot or don't offer them  Service - fail"}
{"text":"Waited an extremely long time for food and drinks and we were the only ones in there... other than a couple people coming in to pick up takeout. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is my kids liked their food. But then again, my kids will eat anything. The sushi was average at best. We got three kids meals, and three rolls... and water... our bill was $70!! We will never go back."}
{"text":"Very good sushi and Asian fare.  Great prices.  Love the new owners.  The rainbow rolls and seaweed salad are my go to items.   My better half loves the wider rolls.  Service is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Not that impressive. The inside it well done. There seem to be someone living above the restaurant and they seemed to be having a basketball game during dinner. I asked and the owner said it was \"just some kids\". Great! The service was slow and kind of off. The meal showed up and there was a boat load of food but was some of the worst tasting and watery Hibatchi Steak I had ever had. They clearly don't understand how to Hibatchi there and how Soy Sauce when added will pull out the water from the food and make it soggy. Total waste of $50 for 2 people. Oh and the sign at the front for the beer special does not include the beer on the poster...go figure."}
{"text":"Just heard this restaurant has closed its doors .  Might want to verify before making plans to go."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Went with my family on Christmas Day (has taken me a while to post). To be honest, we couldn't find anything open and this was one of the few choices we were stuck with, but it was totally worth it!! Due to the holiday, only one waitress worked the floor. However, she did an amazing job! It took our food a little bit to come out (due to how busy it was), but our waitress made sure we were taken care of in the mean time. She kept coming back to refill our drinks and see if we needed anything. When the food came out our experience was complete. The food is great!   We have gone back a few times since and it is still great! We order take out all the time and it is always ready and waiting for us (45-50 minutes every time) The same lady that served us the first time is the one that greets us and she is so sweet. Love the customer service in this place. I highly recommend Rainbow Asian Bistro, the food is good and the staff is great!"}
{"text":"Lunch was very good, Hunan Beef Lunch box x 2 with Drinks total cost with Tax $20.61   Price very inexpensive for amount of tasty food.  Will return again."}
{"text":"We were promptly greeted and seated by the hostess, but after 15 minutes of waiting for drink orders to be taken and 3 waitresses walking right pass us and ignoring us, we left.  There were only 4 tables occupied and 3 waitresses and 1 hostess working.   After  we were seated, 2 of the waitresses looked over at our table and began discussing who had which tables.  Same waitresses cleared and cleaned 2 dirty tables, but didn't seem to care if we were ever going to be waited on.  They didn't even bother to alert the hostess, who had disappeared somewhere.   We were disappointed, as we want any restaurant in the Lake Wylie area to do well since we have so few to choose from."}
