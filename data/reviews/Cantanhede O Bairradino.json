{"text":"$6 for a dry sandwich. The chicken was moist and a decent amount but bland - it it needed salt and pepper. Bad communication too. I asked for a salad and sandwich for takeout. And just got the sandwich."}
{"text":"I frigging love this place. Everything is good about it- except the line when it's super busy. But it's actually worth the wait. The mouth watering baby spuds and the flavorful chicken is amazing topped with the hot sauce. The ladies there work their butts off in that place and the owner usually shuts down and they all take vacation at the same time for a month. The food is always good and always fresh!"}
{"text":"Place is awesome. Grew up across the street and ordered here often. Best Portuguese churasco chicken, sweet sauce (doce) means mild. Their roasted round potatoes and rice are great as is the bitoque (grilled steak with fried egg on to with rice and fries. Great prices/value. Good people work there, solid place."}
{"text":"Saw a group of immigrant Portuguese construction workers with fat overweight Canadian girls eating chicken meals in to go styrofoam capsules. Smelt and looked good. Followed my nose into this Grungy looking restaurant. Ordered half chicken meal. Chicken was so delicious. I would have thought it was deep fried. I lathered every bite of the chicken neck like I was a teenager on prom night. The rice was and potatoes were irresistable to the last bite. I was flabbergasted by the huge portion. All this for under $10. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"seriously amaz food, great helpful staff, and customers as well! spent 40 bucks for a take away dinner for 6 (leftovers? yes) and the people in line completely helped out - \"you want this, you want that, how many people, if i were you\"... i LOVED it - and more importantly - it was very very good"}
{"text":"We generally have major no complaints about this place, but we felt pretty ripped off this Thanksgiving. Our oven wasn't in full working order, so we opted to order a ready-made turkey to go. We called a few days ahead, explaining how we'd need to feed 7 or so people. They told us they'd have a 6kilo turkey that would be adequate for $60.  

When we picked it up on Sunday, it barely weighed 7 pounds, looking half the size that they had mentioned.. and they still had the audacity to charge us the full $60. It was highway robbery! We were lucky to have prepared a great deal of side dishes and alternative meat items.  

 Furthermore.. it was super dry, and tasted ok. Wasn't a fan of the orange zestiness to it. We won't be ordering here again. The bbq chicken is good here, but I wouldn't rank it in my top 10 in Toronto. Portuguese Churrasqueiras are a dime a dozen in this city."}
{"text":"My favorite chicken place.  A buck or two more than your supermarket chickens but it includes sauce and is cut up and ready to eat.  Tastes better too. Breast is not dry like other places and the wings are usually not burnt.  Piri piri sauce is a hit or miss. Sometimes you get the pepper at the bottom and other times it's all oil."}
{"text":"Since moving to the West side of the city I've been slowly working my way through the Churrasco places one quarter chicken meal at a time. I finally stopped into Cantanhede O Bairradino a couple weeks ago and I have been back a couple times since. The grilled chicken is amazing and so are the sides that come with it. Excellent value and great food. So far I have only had the chicken but I will try something else next time as the other meals also look great."}
{"text":"Stopped by here when I was on my way to see a client. I was hungry and couldn't wait any longer I had to get something to eat and I saw the sign for Portuguese Chicken and pulled over. This turned out to be an unfortunate mistake. I found it to be average at best. Friendly but chill, they don't say more than they have to. The food was mediocre at best. I would not stop in again if I was in the area, I would keep driving and look for something else.."}
{"text":"I knew I was in a good meal when I entered the busy restaurant, and my party was the only party not speaking Portuguese. 

The chicken & sauce were delicious. Really  moist too. It was decent value too, at about $12. We added a side of rice & potato balls that brought the total to $18. I'm not usually a carbs guy, but the rice & potato balls were both good. 

I wasn't the biggest fan of the suckling pig. There just wasn't that much meat. The taste was fine though. 

Its a small place with only a few small tables. Caters mainly for take out. Accepts debit card. There  is free street parking."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place other than it is awesome of you like Portuguese Chicken and massive amounts of it.  They specialize in their butterflied chicken and many home cooked Portuguese dishes they offer.  The decor is nothing to go crazy about, but the food is what this place is all about!

The chicken is tender and juicy and although a bit bland at times, the hot sauce they offer will fix that right up.  When you order any size they offer, they give you generous amounts of rice and potatoes on the side as well.  Enough to provide you with sufficient carbs for the month!  I enjoy both side options and never finish either of them.  My favourite dish they offer is the garlic and onion squid.  They cook it about 2 times a week, and the squid is tender and so juicy.

The service staff are always friendly and kind and they have a very quick check out.  Be sure to check out their dessert area as well, as they offer many tasty treats there too!  I'll be sure to come back for more of this very soon!"}
{"text":"Interesting place to come. Very close to our house , my girlfriend came here after a desperate Pizza experience. Worried whether we would get enough food, we ordered a chicken and a side of fries and salad. Grand total was 15 bucks. 

We think we should maybe have got the chicken dinner as that seems to come with potatoes, rice and piri piri Sauve but we did not see that on the menu. ( I guess its just assumed you can get it). Chock it up to cultural differences. 

Pretty good food I will re-rate next time I am in."}
{"text":"What can I say?! Their chicken is absolutely the best. Their potatoes are so good I dream about them. It's truly the perfect lunch for when you need something quick, delicious, and filling.

And if that were all that'd be good enough, but the \"small chicken & potatoes\" (which is more than enough for lunch) is only $7 with a can of pop! SEVEN DOLLARS!! 

The chicken is never dry like you might get at Swiss Chalet, and with the spicy sauce (don't worry, it's not too spicy) it's so succulent it can't be beat.

This has to be one of my favourite lunch options in the city!"}
{"text":"There is always a lineup here, for good reason.  The food is good and very cheap. Their grilled chicken is excellent - smoky, nice and juicy, really good piri-piri sauce -  one of the best churrasco chickens in Toronto. The potatoes are also very good - crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside. I have only had a few of their other dishes, but all were very good - the salt cod was particularly tasty. Although they have a few tables, I've never seen anyone eat here; it's basically a takeout joint. 

The staff are friendly but a bit brusque, understandable given the steady stream of people. The majority of the clientele seem to be regulars and the staff staff speak primarily Portuguese; I have had mild language barrier issues a couple of times, so I'd suggest going at off-peak hours if you have questions about the menu or want anything other than grilled 
chicken or what they happen to have as dinner specials that day."}
{"text":"I remember Portugese chicken being a bit bland from my last visit to Toronto. However, being that this place is close to home and always has a line up at lunch, I had to try it one day. 

My friend and I decided to go for a late lunch/dinner. After deciding we didn't want to go far, we popped inside. There was already a line up at 5:00 PM.  A lady in line suggested we try the chicken instead of fish, pork, lamb, or rabbit. We decided to try the $10 portion, that comes with four pieces of chicken, and two sides instead of $5 portion with two pieces. The worker even let us put back some rice so that we can have a third side. 

The chicken was so fresh and crispy similar to the skin of peking duck. The potato ball was moist and flavourful.  The rice was nicely seasoned and fluffy. My favorite was their side of white fish saut√©ed with onions and herbs. So good. My friend and I were stuffed on $10. We're coming back with a bottle of wine for take out one day."}
{"text":"Long line ups for their takeout counter. People were speaking mostly in portugese. The chicken was decent, but is quite greasy. The crispy skin is tasty and chicken was juicy. Good for a quick dinner but you probably don't want to eat this every day because I don't think it's the healthiest thing! Their sides were quite popular but we didn't get to try it. Will come back and try their suckling pig."}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered the chicken dinner with rice and potatoes, mainly because I'm too confused/scared of the portuguese menus/server ladies, but I love it! There's always a line up to the door(but it's a tiny joint so it's not that long) but it's worth it for the huge portion of BBQ and tasty potatoes with rice! 
One day I'll try that roasting pig in the oven behind the counter...."}
{"text":"THE best Portuguese Chicken in the GTA... Bar none and I've had plenty. Best grilled and best mild hot piri-piri sauce ever, will not have any other."}
{"text":"Just delicious .. I had the grilled fish and for 12$ I eat like a princesses! 

Best place I had in GTA! 

I had a huge salad portion with a delicious fish !!! 

Cook at perfection 

10/10"}
{"text":"$12 for a whole roasted/grilled chicken 

The chicken was tender with a crispy skin.  I would def order it again.   

Only issues were that I thought they served roasted chicken but she said they only had grilled chicken but it wasn't the regular \"grilled\" chicken I was expecting.  Also, even though I ordered a whole chicken 1 breast was super tiny and the other looked decent. Just thought that was odd."}
{"text":"I tried the BBQ chicken and Parisienne potatoes last night based on a friend's recommendation that I try this place out. I would say that everything I was told came as advertised. Expect a good affordable meal, with sizable portions, and you may have to wait in line to get it. The skin on the chicken was quite crispy and caramelized and while eating it I might have referred to it as the 'tasty bits'. The only knock I would have would be that it might be a tad greasy, but it's probably from the fat of the chicken and/or oil and that's how the skin is so crispy and delicious. You give some to get some I guess. I'm not usually one to eat tons of chicken skin, but at this place I couldn't get enough of it. Perhaps chicken skin is the new bacon. The BBQ chicken was 12 dollars, and the potatoes (and all other sides) seem to be 2.50. They also load those containers to the top! (tip: If you are an English speaker like me, the English menu is hidden by the front entrance.) A great thing about this place is the tax is included in the price, as my bill came to 14.50 flat. Finding a decent meal for that much money in this city, that could also feed a small family, is very rare and that is why I am giving this place 5 stars. If you like small independent mom and pop shops that sell cheap, good, and large portion food, then this place is for you."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Cantanhede O Bairradino.  You order at the counter ... just cash and debit accepted.  There are three tables if you want to stay (which I did).

I ordered a half chicken dinner with potatoes and rice.  The cost was $11 with a pop (including tax) so not a bad deal.  The cashier/cook had asked me if I wanted sweet or hot sauce.  I said sweet but I didn't notice any sauce on anything.  The potatoes were good, the chicken was good (it was cut in weird pieces) and the rice was just so-so.

Though it was good, I've had a better Portuguese chicken dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"Capital Y-U-M!  Had the chicken, rice, and potatoes tonight.  Some kind guy aka my bro Jordan was all about this place and picked up the goods for our Sunday night dinner with the fam.  Everything was good even though it had been sitting waiting for us for a few hours.  I'm cutting calories, but I couldn't resist going back for seconds of the chicken.

Haven't been there in person to get the full experience, but I look forward to giving this place another go."}
{"text":"Best lunch under $10 in the area. They chicken is never dry the positions are great and the Piri Piri sauce is so flavourful. Fish is great too and the meat specials are always interesting."}
{"text":"Nom! The Portugese chicken was fresh, succulent with crispy skin, and chose the rice and potatoes. The potatoes come in the perfectly round \"melon\" ball shapes, and is scattered with olives. The rice has some veggies, and when I say \"some\" I mean, halfway through the meal, I found 1 pea. 

Also tried the garlic and onion squid, which was incredibly tender! I'm used to being unimpressed with squid - it's usually tough and not unlike chewing gum. This was even more tender than my chicken! 

The meal comes with a side of sauce, which gives everything a mildly spicy kick.

The portions are overflowing, and the overall effect is having a warm, home-cooked meal."}
{"text":"some of the best churrasco in the city. more of a take out spot but space inside to eat. great chicken, sides are good and the pirri pirri is outstanding."}
{"text":"Always a wait, always worth it..variety of Portuguese dishes..best suckling pig and BBQ chicken in Toronto."}
{"text":"My favourite are the fish fillets... it's white fish, fried but soft and fluffy as it is softened in lemon. Little potatoes are awesome, just add a bit of salt (I like that they don't add a lot of salt to their food so people can choose to be as healthy as they want or avoid salt if needed). Prices are amazing, in fact I have no idea how they stay open considerring if you buy perisian potatoes and make them yourself, you will actually pay more than you do here. Staff a nice but seem overworked and /or underpaid but give them a tip since the foods so cheap! I got 2 fish fillets and potatoes and rice (hald and half in size small container) for UNDER $10 and had tuns of potatoes left over! YUUUUMMMY"}
