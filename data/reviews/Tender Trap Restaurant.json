{"text":"The food is delicious. Again, not the bedding in toronto, but definately better than most. Delivery was fast and the food was perfectly cooked. No raw meat taste. The negative reviews are unwarranted on this one. Tender Trap is my new go to Chinese delivery options!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the bad reviews, it's not the best Chinese place but it's authentic, the portion sizes are very reasonable and I have NEVER had issues with the food quality (although I think egg rolls suck in Canada almost anywhere). It's too busy for the food to be bad and maybe if you order from home you might get confused, but if you go into the place and look on their picture board, you can get a number of simple dishes that serve up just like the pictures, unlike many places out there. I am led to believe the bad reviews have been left by competition in some cases trying to make a very cool place look bad, f@ck what you heard, try it for yourself"}
{"text":"I was very satisfied with my lunch here.  Not the best Chinese food in Toronto but hits the spot when you want cheap, good, somewhat greasy, Chinese food."}
{"text":"Oh man I thought it's ok food but my last meal from there made me sick. Lots of washroom trips. Bad."}
{"text":"I usually order their greasy chicken wings. It is what it is. The last time I ordered wings I got sick. So no more wings for me. Live and learn!!"}
{"text":"I agree with the previous review... I don't understand the negative reviews either... The food is very good....i have ordered a couple of times without every any disappointments..... I love thier lemon chicken"}
{"text":"gross.  sorry i can't say anything else but that.  i had vegetarian chow mein.  the veggies they put in it was celery, carrots, mushrooms and onion. all low quality veggies and they were cut all different sizes and some of the produce was NOT fresh; some of the veggies were brown.  the springroll was off... and a springroll is pretty hard to mess up but they did.   they put corn in it.... ick man..."}
{"text":"Used to be really good. Since last year the increased their prices and food quality had gone down. The wings are good also are the chicken balls and the deep fried squid. Everything else is average. Too bad. It used to be a great place. Just lost its touch."}
{"text":"I've had wings here before and I come here often for it. For special occasions, I normally order their party trays. The Cantonese Chow Mein is my favourite dish from there. The only problem I had is that the usual waitress there was switched which results in a less efficient service.  Overall, I enjoy my gluttonous appetite for Chinese food there."}
{"text":"guys please save yourself the money, i got noodle soup from here and you could taste raw meat on some of the veggies (bok choy)  its pretty obvious there's not even some semblance of washing the veggies going on there honestly I'm pretty lax about food and i got take out so there's no complaints about customer service or anything but the food is plain up nasty"}
{"text":"I was told not to judge a book by its cover and so we decided to eat here despite the non appetizing exterior decor. The inside is just as bad. I'm not even sure how old the tables and chairs were but they felt grimey and disgusting.  The service was not any better, it was horrible. When we got there, there was absolutely no one else but us. It took about 10 minutes to be seated. She did not come back with the menu right away... we waited for another 10 minutes... and the wait time for us to order must have been another 10 minutes. I understand if it was busy, but it was not. It was dead.  Our food came out and it was mediocre at best... I had a few bites and called it quits. The portion was massive but that didn't mean much when the food was poorly made. I ordered the chicken balls combo and the boyfriend ordered the pork chop combo. There was no follow-up whatsoever on how the food was and or if we had any problem.  And when we were done, we had to wave down the staff to cash us out. They give no shit about guest experience, just your money."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Chinese food and love trying new places, even if not new foods. My standards are a beef fried rice, sweet and sour pork, and General Tao's chicken. Some places of course do it better than others...  That being said, this was one of the others. I found the rice to be rather dry and not fresh. The sweet and sour pork was decent but quite fatty. The General Tao's was not even a little spicy but it was a nice flavour and the chicken itself was good. The prices of all were a little higher than normal as well which can only be accredited to the money that went into the decor.  It was one of the nicer looking Chinese restaurants I have visited in a while. I have been used to the low quality tables and chairs thrown into a room that was probably not intended to be a restaurant. That was probably the only thing worthwhile about the restaurant as none of us were impressed with the food or the service. If you are in a rush or wants a good meal at a good price,  I definitely don't recommend the Tender Trap..."}
