{"text":"Had high hopes for Paramour but in the end was seriously let down. From the get-o the service felt clumsy and rushed. We were asked at least 4 times what our wine selection was before we even ordered our starters and mains. I know their head server has a fantastic reputation but sadly he wasn't there. The scallop and bacon chowder was lukewarm on arrival and honestly quite bland. Rasted corn and jalepeno hush puppies were really a spin on indian bhajis but agian, the flavors just just didn't pop and came off flat. For mains we went with streak frites and oven roasted chicken which were acceptible but to be honest I probably could have pulled either on of them off myself with better success.  Shame cause it's a nice room. Step it up Paramour!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant.  

The service was lovely.  Very engaged, observant and attentive without overwhelming which would have made for a pleasant experience in itself.  The food really took it to the next level.

I had a melon, cucumber and feta salad with a champagne mint dressing.  It was so fresh and delicious.  Perfect for a summer evening.  After that, I wasn't sure how my main course could stack up.  

I decided to try their vegetarian option just to do something a little different and because the words \"goat cheese\" lured me in.  I am SO glad I did.  A lot of places do meat and fish and salad well, or even great.  But i can't think of *that* many cooked, non starchy vegetables that have blown me away.  My meal was this amazing tower of perfectly done vegetables layered with just enough soft goat cheese on a bed of couscous with pesto.  WOW.  Just - WOW.  It was so delicious that my mouth is watering now just thinking about it.  I was particularly impressed with the eggplant in the tower.  I find ordering eggplant is touch and go - so often it just isn't right.  The eggplant was insanely delish and the perfect texture.  

The other 3 people I was with all enjoyed their apps, mains and deserts as well and said their food was excellent - but if there was one resounding theme at the end of the meal from all of us, it was that their attention and ability with vegetables is really what sets the food apart."}
{"text":"First, to Melinda. Got a laugh from your \"over 40\" comment... I guess we really can't call ourselves hipsters anymore, huh? Even if we were once upon a time. How about \"cripsters\"?

Just had a great dinner at Paramour. Friendly, attentive waitresses, delish food... and what a chocolate bread pudding! Of course the place wasn't crowded at all, and we didn't have to wait for anything. Liked the small menu... made things easier for us senile types."}
{"text":"One of the most Romantic Restaurants in the city. I visited this French Romantic GEM and was really impressed with the simple yet creative themed menu, nice flowing music and retro art of women posing or blowing kisses on the wall. The food was amazing and I was treated like gold :)"}
{"text":"You can tell Ossington has gentrified just by looking at the menu at the newly opened Paramour Restaurant. I definitely recommend Paramour for it's impeccable service and food. But it ain't cheap!

The other patrons in the restaurant were all over 40, some quite a bit older, and all seemed to be enjoying it. Another sign Ossington isn't just for hipsters anymore!

Decor is weird. Head shots that belong in a beauty salon. Pretty comfy pink cushions along the wall. Good jazz music playing not too loud for background.

The server was great. She took care of us, had a strong knowledge of the food and drink menu, and was a delight!

The food was great too! We ordered the Crudo appetizer to share, which was a \"mediterranean styled sashimi dish\" of scallops. Delicious, and I loved the slaw that accompanied it, as well as the rim of smoked sea salt (I believe that's what it was) that was such a nice edge to every bite.

For mains we ordered the rainbow trout - HUGE piece of fish, and the New York strip, which was perfectly cooked as ordered.  The food was delicious, this chef has chops. Thank God too because as I mentioned, not cheap. Mains are between $26-$34. It's very good food, and you know what you're eating. This is very high level Continental cuisine.

Wines are priced starting at $50. By the glass starting at $11.

So while I liked Paramour very much and would go back, it won't be often because of the prices."}
{"text":"I am not sure I can find the right words to describe my experience at this restaurant, but I will try. As soon as my group came in we were warmly greeted, our jackets taken away, and shown to our table. The service was beyond excellent. The menu is very small, making each meal a masterpiece. I like to refer to my taste buds a lot, as they are my inspiration for these reviews, and this time is no exception; the taste buds were in utopia.  The food melted in my mouth. There is nothing else to say."}
