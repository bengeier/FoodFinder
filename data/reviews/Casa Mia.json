{"text":"Dinner last night...was exceptional for Scottsdale...small,busy,friendly...good service...open to changes in a dish...split in the kitchen..a lot home made...owner on premises..wine by glass superb..Antinori...well worth the 10$...all hot tasty fresh...good mouth feel to sauces...even though half full..not noisy....decoration better than location ...a bit out there in the boonies but worth the drive...will go back....bar crowded...all good."}
{"text":"Such an amazing dinner!  We are so lucky to have this right in our backyard.  It is my new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Total fan!  Love this hidden gem. Superb service and tortellini to die for.  Good wine list as well."}
{"text":"Most delicious authentic Italian I've had in the US. You wouldn't leave this place unhappy. The setting is cozy and a perfect spot for VD, anniversaries, or a special date. They'll make you feel like you're in Italy."}
{"text":"This isn't to many options around this area so it's just incredible to find real Italian food that is good enough that we would drive out of our way to get ..but don't have to...if it's not on the menu just ask for it...the made to order Alfredo sauce is something out of this world..and the chicken piccata..my favorite..though not on the menu..should be....my family and I go here once a month and never been dissapointed .family owned and the whole family works here so you know your home..."}
{"text":"Casa Mia is my favorite restaurant  iin Scottsdale.  It has authentic and delicious Italian food. It is a little more expensive than some of the other Italian restaurants but it is worth every cent."}
{"text":"Went there last Wednesday for the first time. 
Food and waiter were very good but the bartender has to go,,,She made it seem as though she was doing us a favor by taking our drink order,,,no repore, no personality.

Owners are very gracious and engaging which was a nice touch.
3 stars for food and waiter,,, 0 stars for bartender.

{"text":"The hubs and I ventured out to Casa Mia based on a friend's recommendation. We were both even more excited after we read all of the rave reviews!

We arrived and were promptly seated - we were both impressed with the decor of the place, and were definitely enjoying the vibe.

We started off with a bottle of Red - it was on special for around $50 and it was delicious. Our server was great, very friendly and joked around with us.

We ordered the buffalo mozzarella for an appetizer, and it was incredible! I ordered a chicken dish, and the hubs ordered the risotto. Both were good, however we both said that we wished we would have ordered a pasta dish instead.

It took another 30 minutes to get our bill, which was a little annoying, but forgivable. All in all, it was a nice night out, but I doubt we'd make the trek back out there again. And that makes me sad because I truly wanted to be won over!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. As a regular customer, I appreciate that the experience is consistently outstanding. Comfortable, homey, friendly atmosphere. Fresh, top-quality food. Excellent service. Our go to for Italian food!!"}
{"text":"Scottsdale's best kept secret. Casa Mia is a hidden gem in Scottsdale Mountain. It's grown in popularity but hasn't sacrificed in quality over the years. Although from San Francisco, I make my mom take me here at least once while visiting. Portions are generous as are the pours. It's got a hometown, neighborhood feel, albeit the quiet plaza it sits in. Â¡Viva la pasta!"}
{"text":"We've been going to this restaurant for several years. It's great. The food is fresh, authentic and excellent. Some of the dishes you can't get anywhere else in the Valley.

The food is pricey (over $20 for almost every entree), so it's not everyday dining. (The wine list is good and very reasonable, however.). Nor would I bring kids here, although some do. But for a Saturday night with friends, it is really a special place.

The service is good, knowledgeable and polite. I've never been treated poorly in a dozen or so visits. All in all, disregard the negative reviews and try it.

FYI, the location is in a half-empty strip mall, but the restaurant itself is well marked."}
{"text":"This is a nice place, It is a bit pricey. Husband and I went. We had an app. and each had an entree. I had 2 glasses of wine. He had 3 beers. and the bill was a bit over $100.  However, the food is of top notch quality ingredients, and I loved my dish. I had the pappardelle with shrimp, squid, olives, and tomatoes and I am still thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Four of us dropped in at Casa Mia on a Thursday night - no reservation required at this time of year in AZ!  As usual, the service, food and wine were fantastic.  My wife and I and our good friends have frequented Casa Mia about 6-8 times in the last year and the experience is always great.  The Cod special was enjoyed by three of us last night and I had the Penne 85269, a superb penne with chicken and tasty red cream sauce.  The atmosphere is very comfortable - this doesn't mean a dress code, it just means that we feel at home here."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try a restaurant rated so high and of course my favorite is italian.  All I can say is be careful what you order off the specials menu.  I ordered the veal chop, expecting something with a sauce.  It was a generous portion, a full chop, pounded and breaded.  It was served with lemon, arugula and Parmesan cheese on the side.....that's it....price $45.  It was bland and when I mentioned this to the wait staff they said they liked it that way, but what a disappointment for me! I learned my lesson, no ordering off the special menu and always ask about the accompanying sauce, if any.  A mustard sauce would have been great.

The wine was delicious, as was the garden salad.  My husband liked his entree.  To be fair I rated four stars but thought I should mention that you might feel like you have been robbed when you get the bill......"}
{"text":"It's a freak thing that we were back less than a week later, but we wanted to meet up with some friends we hadn't seen in a while and lo and behold, this is their regular Friday night hang out. We were pretty excited to replicate our experience the previous Saturday...but, well, it sort of ended there. 
Wine again, excellent, salad was good (I had the mixed greens) but Honey's Caesar was just okay. Onto the tagliatelle with bolognese and veal with prosciutto and sage. Honey's pasta was really disappointing. We were both drooling over the description on the menu and I was excited to share plates (again). It just did nothing for either of us. It was sort of like the night where you didn't feel much like cooking so you just defrosted something from the freezer and went on with your life. 

 My veal was thin sliced - which I love, but the sauce made the light breading pasty and it just wasn't good. It seems my experience with good veal is extremely limited. Is it that tricky? Should I learn my lesson(s) and just stop ordering it? Plus, I would rather not have mashed potatoes with my Italian meal. A side of buttered noodles would have fared better for me. 

All in all, we are bummed. It is a pricey place and now that we're on the fence, I'm just not sure I would spend that kind of money on a plate of pasta unless it consistently blew me away. Unfortunately it's the second go-round that I will remember the most."}
{"text":"They opened Wednesday and hit the ground running.  Beautiful space, comfortable vibe, delicious pizza, and excellent, affordable selection of wines.  What more could you ask for?

We had 3 pizzas (they haven't rolled out the whole menu yet) - 4 seasons, white pizza with fig, and a sausage and ham special.  All were delicious.  Also had a frozen chocolate dessert that was very good.

Currently they plan to open for mornings and evenings.  Hopefully down the road demand will justify a lunch service too.

Service was very friendly and comfortable.  Can't wait to come back for coffee and baked goods in the morning. So happy to have this wonderful addition to our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Most overcooked pasta ever had in my life........one good thing  was the appetizer with scallops and saffron....not enough to make me go back."}
{"text":"So I will start off by saying I don't often seek out Italian restaurants, having been scarred by too many Americanized chains serving meals that were probably made in some factory, sealed up in some vacuum pack and heated up by their so called chefs. However, after tonight I am quite thankful to my wife who was craving some Italian for stumbling across Casa Mia in the restaurant.com listings.

While we made reservations just in case, there were plenty of open tables on the Tuesday night that we went however the place was far from empty. We were greeted at the door by a friendly older Italian gentleman who I would assume is the owner. The restaurant has a nice ambiance set by dim lighting and modern but warm decor that avoided the typical cheesy Italian restaurant decorations.

We were served by Nantas (thanks to Mitchell L. for listing his name with the picture here on Yelp, not sure if he actually told us his name) I'm guessing was part of the restaurant owner's family. While fairly friendly, his lack of attentiveness to us was probably the main caveat I had in our dining experience. This was mainly caused by the fact that he seemed to know everyone else dining that evening and in typical Italian fashion was talking up a storm with each of him. So it seems this could be quite a good thing if you were a regular but as a friendly suggestion to the restaurant, don't forget those regulars were once new customers as well.

Finally, to the most important part... the food. As you could guess from my intro, both my wife and myself enjoyed our meals thoroughly in large part due to the fresh ingredients and the made to order meal. As a quick aside, thanks to the made to order nature of the food and the style of service, don't come here if you are in a hurry, but if you have some time, it will be well worth spending it there. We started by sharing a Caesar salad which was fairly typical with homemade croutons, anchovies (to order, they were kind enough to split and leave them off for my wife), and a lighter Caesar dressing. Their strength, however, seemed to be in the true Italian dishes. I had the Pappardelle del Capitano which had freshly made pappardelle pasta with cherry tomatoes, shrimp, squid (and let me tell you, they aren't shy with the helping of the seafood on the dish), olives, capers, and arugula. I didn't find the pasta to be overcooked as many of the negative reviews complained of, perhaps just slightly past perfect if I were to be very picky. The dish made for a wonderful combination of flavors without any one ingredient taking dominating. The shrimp and squid both seemed true to their flavor and clearly weren't mishandled in the trip from sea to plate. Only thing I found myself yearning for were perhaps a few more capers and maybe a dash of white wine to brighten up the dish just a little. My wife similarly enjoyed her Gnocchi alla Sorrentina which had a tomato basil cream sauce that maintained an amazingly fresh and light flavor even with the creamy component. We finished the meal with a very non-Italian lava cake that was served with a nice and tart raspberry drizzle and freshly made whipped cream.

All in all, Casa Mia certainly redeemed my image of what Italian restaurants can be. While a little bit pricy, the food was very fresh, well crafted, and in turn quite delicious and much more worth the cost then the the aforementioned Americanized take on Italian. Keep in mind, the freshly made food does come at a cost of time as does the many conversations the waiter had with regulars, but once again, a cost worth paying in my opinion."}
{"text":"At there last night and I'm still in shock over the experience.  This is my first bad review on Yelp.  Ordered the fish special which was the sea bass.  Told the server that I'm on a restrictive diet and he described the dish as simply pan seared served with Mashed potatoes and veggies.  Asked for no potatoes.  Had a great gazpacho soup first.  Huge portion. Wrapped up half.  The fish came and it was covered in buttered shiitake mushrooms which I removed and it wasn't properly pan seared.  In fact, there was so much oil that it was more poached. I had a family member try it and she agreed it was \"rich\".  No big deal.  It happens.  But the response from the staff was like a Kitchen Nightmares episode.  When asked how I liked my meal, and my response was, \"it's a little rich\", the server said that everyone loves the sea bass!  People come in just for the sea bass (not a menu item).  This is how Mediterranean food is prepared!  There was no offer to refire or choose another item.  Then the Chef came out of the kitchen to berate me.  I had to ask him to leave the table.  When the check came, I asked if my gratuity can go to the table runner because she was sweet.  The server said, \"I don't care if you don't give me a gratuity but I'm your server.  I didn't know the chef was going to come out to your table.  I didn't tell him to.  I told the owner your complaint and she said that you have to pay for everything because you ate it all (ummmmmm.... I ate a bit).  I told him that I manage a concierge team at a luxury resort and his reply was... \"We'll survive\".  This experience cost me $175 for three ppl."}
{"text":"Tomato soup was so so. The risotto(shrimp, scallops, asparagus) was absolutely delicious. My husband ordered pappardelle al fiorno which he  enjoyed tremedously. I am dreaming of the Tiramasu!! Will return nrxt time we are in scottsdale."}
{"text":"I love this place. Three years ago I was in the PHX area for a project. A fellow info architect took us to Casa Mia, and we had great times there. Great service, excellent wine selection, and wonderful food.

Fast forward to January 2010. I'm in PHX again for work. I hook up with my friends...and we go to Casa Mia for old times's sake.

You know it's a great Italian restaurant when you see a Moto Guzzi Quota parked in front, ridden by the bartender. Inside, the warm interior invites you to enjoy great food. the attentive owner, owner's son, and wait staff all provide impeccable service. The saltimbocca was delicious. My friend's osso bucca was off the hook, and his girlfriend's herbed chicken with a side of tortelini was perfect.

The tiramisu is some of the best I've ever had. All in all--they've not lost their touch."}
{"text":"Traditional flavors with modern decor.

My husband and I read great reviews about this restaurant online so we were excited to try it for ourselves. 

I ordered the tagliatelle bolognese. It has been a few years since I have had a good bolognese so I was ecstatic from the first bite of my dish. It was very traditional in preparation and flavor. And I was happy that it wasn't too salty otherwise it would have ruined the natural taste of the pork and beef.

My husband ordered an app of squid cooked in wine. It was fresh and mild. The squid was showcased beautifully without the use of batter or deep frying it. 

For my husband's main dish he had the Frutti de Mar with linguine. It was slightly spicy and chocked full of  shrimp, mussels, clams and squid. 

We were stuffed at this point but we wanted to try dessert. We had expresso and a cannoli. Usually cannolis can be too sweet but this one was perfect and the addition of the crushed pistachios on top was yummy."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm biased because this restaurant is so close to my home, which is out of the way to begin with, but it is a favorite of mine. Family-run, fresh and sophisticated Italian food, intriguing special menu items, nice atmosphere. It is pricey but in my opinion worth it!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Italian restaurant in AZ. My boyfriend is long distance and every time he flies out here, we make sure to go to Casa Mia, so we're there AT LEAST once a month. Hera (the owner) is so sweet and makes the experience even better when we go. I almost always get either the risotto or a seafood dish, depending on my mood and both are to die for. My boyfriend typically ends up getting chicken with a nice topping of tomato sauce and he loves it. We share a bottle of nice white wine. And also enjoy the tomato soup as an appetizer. It is my favorite tomato soup in town! I absolutely recommend going to Casa Mia for any occasion- date nights, celebrations, etc. Even the inside is beautiful!! Try it out and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"The best authentic Italian restaurant in Arizona!! I'm from Italy and it's usually hard to find real Italian food, but this restaurant it's just perfect! Great staff and great food! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Refined and Excellent Italian Food.  Great neighborhood find.  Best Italian we have had since moving here from Boston.  Wine list carries great Italian wines, both red and white.  My husband had the Pappa al Pomodoro, which had the right balance of tomatoes with spices and cheese.  The cesare was fresh with the perfect balance of anchovy in the dressing and not too much dressing.  The homemade pasta and sausage in the Strascinati was excellent, with a nice creamy sauce.  The saffron cream sauce in the Pappardelle was amazing and the scallops were fresh and perfectly cooked - crusty on the outside, not over done, but hot on the inside.  The topping was the best cannoli outside the North End of Hanover St in Boston.  Service was superb!  From the hostess to the waiter to the bus boy (yes, he was polite, polished and discrete - I would have tipped him too). The place was packed, yet we didn't feel rushed, nor did we have to wait overlong for courses or drinks.  Loved the ambiance with the views and the music.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Food is not up to the hype. The calamari fritti were chewy, the nightly special Sausage Ravioli were overcooked. Not worth the drive and the price."}
{"text":"This place is out of this world! The atmosphere is great, the food delcious and the service was excellent as well. In the winter time make sure you make a reservation."}
{"text":"If you are not among the regular group of \"friends and family\" do not waste your time at this establishment.  We have dined here numerous times over the past several years, each time finding the food acceptable and the service poor.  On our last dinner experience, the evening ended with my husband finally going to the bar to ask for our check after our server was MIA for 30 minutes.  When we last stopped in and managed to snag two seats at the bar (see below for the significance of this statement), the calimari in umido, which was a prior staple for us, lacked any of the spice of the spicy sauce boasted on the menu.  We had to remedy the issue by adding a generous helping of red pepper flakes.

Additionally, they have a policy of reserving seats at the bar for their usual favorite customers so when you arrive to attempt to eat at the bar, you will be thwarted by the tiny \"Reserved\" signs at any of the available seats. It appears that there is some inside group of people who are able to reserve seats at the bar even though they are not immediately eating.  The bartender informed us that there wouldn't be any bar seating available tonight because no on had even ordered yet when we arrived at 6:30.  Essentially a group of squatters sits their with their napkins on the bar and bread in front of them while they drink their vodka drinks and socialize.  Why not get a table if that's the plan?  Needless to say, how many restaurants do you know that reserve open seating areas for their favorites? Nonetheless, we opted to stand and have a glass of what turned out to be an incredibly light and watery Super Tuscan.  After much waiting when we were finished, we were finally able to pay and end this unpleasant experience.  Needless to say, you can find much better Italian fare and wine elsewhere and there is no need to inconvenience yourself with the frustration of this establishment."}
{"text":"I am sorry, but all that I have heard about is that I need to try Casa Mia...Casa Mia is the best Italian restaurant in the valley...WRONG!    Come on, its really not that hard to make good authentic Italian food here...in 2 1/2 years I have yet to find an Italian restaurant that I enjoy going back to.  Therefore, I make my own.

I walked in to see that it was a full restaurant..good sign.  The host/owner sat my friends and I down at the last table the restaurant had available.  2 folks were sitting at the small bar.  So I would say that there was at least 20 tables...ONLY ONE WAITER!  This poor guy is running around while the owner and bartender DID NOTHING BUT WATCH.  Already not good.  So it took a little while for the waiter to come to our table, not his fault but the owner could have come and taken our drink order which was a bottle of Chianti .  (The owner I think thought his last name was Soprano) 

The food was not good and not worth the price.  I had the calamari in tomato broth...$17 for over cooked calamari in a watered tomato sauce...not good.  Then I opted for the penne with chicken and mushrooms in a pink sauce. How can you mess this one...well it happened.  It lacked flavor, the chicken and mushrooms were overdone and a bit burnt and the gravy had NO taste....So I tried DUMPING parmesan on...that didn't help!

For dessert, this absolutely kills me....my little sister had the cream puffs with chocolate.  Since when are cream puffs supposed to come in a soup of Hershey syrup.  Terrible!

I have no intentions of going back to Casa Mia.  Too expensive for bad food.  And an owner who is just mindless."}
{"text":"Wonderful family owned Italian restaurant. Excellent octopus and rabbit. Good Italian wine list. Delectable bread pudding."}
{"text":"Every year we visit this way out if the way strip mall Italian restaurant and marvel at how much better it gets. This year was the best. Veal Saltimbocca as thin and tasty as you could hope for, pasta dishes excellent. Calamari fritti the only disappointment; somewhat tough. One of the best cannoli's you will ever have ( with pistachio) and complimentary limoncello to boot. 

Service has been an issue in the past but not tonight; delightful knowledgeable authentic Italian waiter. Worth the drive from old town Scottsdale and a regular stop for our golf group. 

Anyone who has read my reviews knows that I am tough on Italian restaurants with a master chef wife and mother but this is a great spot."}
{"text":"This was our second visit here and we were pleased with our dinner.
It was a Friday night and the restaurant (and bar area) was full.
We enjoyed a drink at the bar before being seated for dinner.
Bartender was very friendly and poured us some nice drinks.

We ordered an appetizer and two pasta courses for dinner.
All were excellent - fresh, tasty and well presented.
There were no leftovers.

Will definitely go back and be sure you make a reservation if it's the weekend.
Lots of locals and regulars eat here as the owners knew most everyone in the restaurant on a first name basis."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about the food at Casa Mia!

My hubby and I first went to this place in April during a visit to Scottsdale.  We went with regulars who suggested we just order several dishes and all share.  Given they were regulars, we allowed them to choose the dishes (at the time we didn't even look at the menu).  We started with an Insalata Mista and then had Spaghetti al Fruti di Mare, Spaghetti alla Checca, as well as a Lamb dish (which must have been a special?).  Everything was extraordinary.  My husband and I spoke about the meal for days.

Since then we have moved to Scottsdale, and tonight we went back to Casa Mia.  Both my husband and I ordered the Spaghetti alla Checca (can you guess which dish we liked the most the first time we were there?).  We both savored every bite!  I'm a true believer that food is best when it's simple, and that's exactly what this dish is, such simple ingredients yet insanely delicious.  It was cooked just perfectly.  My sister was with us and she ordered the Tortellini alla Boscaiola.  She loved her dish as well (I tried a bite and it was delicious, indeed).  Although it was a creamy sauce, it wasn't heavy at all.

The reason I'm giving this restaurant a 4-star rating instead of 5 is because I have 2 very minor complaints.  First, they have extremely dim lighting.  While this creates a nice ambiance, frankly it was very difficult to even read the menu.  Second, after we were done with our meals it took quite a long time for the waitress to come back to our table because she was chatting with the customers at the next table (who were clearly regulars).  I completely understand that she needs to make the regulars feel important so that they'll continue coming back, but, just a thought, maybe new customers will become regulars if they get some more attention.

Either way, we will definitely be back for the delicious food!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit here.  The place is in a very deserted strip mall and was difficult to find the first time.

We made reservations each time, as was recommended by a friend as it is on the smaller, more intimate side.

Being that I am Italian, I am picky about my Italian food.  This place definitely hits the mark.  The portions are good sized. We ordered Calamari Fritti for the app, my bf got a chicken plate, which he enjoyed, I got a pasta dish, Pappardelle ai fiorni, which was very, very good.

The food is definitely fresh, made to order.  The staff is very nice and attentive without being overbearing.  The food is great.  The dessert, we got the Tiramisu, was outstanding.  

All in all a great experience and enjoyed the intimate ambiance of the place."}
{"text":"This is a hidden treasure near the Hidden Hills neighborhood of Scottsdale.  My husband & I had two amazing dishes.  The porcini mushrooms in the Pappardelle were fresh, and the meal was perfect. The Spaghetti with the mullet roe was so unique and flavorful.  This family owned and run restaurant is very special!  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Best Italian in Scottsdale mountain. Great staff, great food and amazing new place. I highly recommend the ribeye and the scallops."}
{"text":"The food has never disappointed my family or friends, but on our last two visits, the smell when you walk in the door needs to be addressed. Is there a sewer problem that is being worked on?  Please fix."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant. Everything was absolutely delicious. I really recommend it compared to everything else I have tried in east Scottsdale.

Well, I returned last night after a year's absence, and was greatly disappointed in the food, the service, and the cost. I had a glass of white wine ($11 and only one cheaper at $10); the pomodori salad ($11), which was very ordinary hot house tomatoes, too much dressing, and no mozzarella; and the penne with chicken ($22). The pasta was right out of a box, the chicken was actually tough, and the sauce was just average and too salty. The waiter stopped by once and asked if everything was ok. I said yes, just ok, but not what I expected. He offered to replace it with something else, but by that time I was almost finished with it and sorry that I had returned. When you pay $54 for a glass of wine, a small salad and a small serving of pasta, you expect all of it to be outstanding. It wasn't, by a long shot. I won't be back."}
{"text":"We live a half mile from here and finally decided to give it a shot. I had the skirt steak. It was over cooked but oddly it tasted amazing. We also had the swordfish and cleaned the plate. Service was quick and great. The grapefruit basil martini was perfect. The room is intimate but it doesn't seem like a tight fit. I can't wait to go back and try some other dishes!"}
{"text":"Casa Mia just can't be beat.  The service was excellent.  

I'm not sure where they get their bread, so nice and crunchy on the outside.  

Two of our guests had the veal saltimbocca and I had the three cheese ravioli with peas, mushrooms and pancetta.   The other guest had the beef short ribs.   Everyone cleaned their plates.  

For dessert we had a pumpkin pie, more like a tort, with a walnut crust.   2 die 4!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I came here for my birthday and every dish my family got was amazing.  The Calamari Fritti was addicting, the Tortellini literally melted in your mouth and the Saltimbocca was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for authentic Italian food! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The owner personally invited me back, and I received excellent service and excellent food."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Situated in a weird strip mall that is mostly vacant on the east edge of Scottsdale, you know it has to be good, because it's not getting any foot traffic yet remains busy pretty much all the time.  Great atmosphere and service that is very matter of fact.  If you are looking for servers who faun all over you with fake smiles, this is not the place.  This feels like an authentic family cooking great food for people who appreciate it.   And great food it is.  I've been to NY, Chicago, LA, Italy, etc etc and would put Casa Mia up against any other Italian restaurant in this price range.  

There's definitely a 'local hangout' feeling at the bar; it seems like everyone there knows each other, which they probably do, and many dining customers are greeted like they eat there all the time.   Make a reservation, they fill up.  

They also opened a pizza joint next door that I can't wait to try next time we're in town."}
{"text":"When you wanna step it up a bit from your typical trip to the Olive Garden this is the place to go for some great Italian food. 

Every dish that I have tried here has been beyond enough to keep me coming back. The food and ingredients are so fresh, I hear that the owner weekly takes a row boat with his sons back to Italy to hand pick the freshest ingredients for the upcoming week... This may or may not be true. But the food is still great. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I just found this diamond in the desert. And so glad I did. Not only is the food outstanding , be sure to try the caprese salad as the mozzarella melts in your mouth and the tiramisu for dessert is great, but the atmosphere and the staff make you feel like long lost friends. The food is delicious and the specials are hard to beat. The homemade limoncello is a wonderful way to end your meal. My new favorite place to spend an evening with good friends."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood gem.  The type of restaurant you want to find when you are out town and want to eat where locals find good food"}
{"text":"Some friends invited us to dinner and suggested Casa Mia which is about a mile behind the Mayo Clinic off of Shea Blvd. in the foothills.  We read the reviews on Yelp before we went and felt we might be in for a interesting dinner.  

We arrive at 6:30 or so on the Sunday evening of Labor Day; not exactly fine dinning time but the parking lot was packed with cars around this one store (remember everything else is closed).  The other two couples had ordered a bottle of wine and appetizers of homemade Italian sausage & Calamari as we arrived. Both were delicious!  Some of us ordered martinis which were tasty and served in an oversizes glass. 

As for dinner, we had the Halibut and the homemade raviolis with bolognese sauce -- again, both were really very good.  Our friends ordered the Veal Saltimbocca and some of their chicken dishes.  We were there for about three hours.  We never felt rushed or that the wait staff was running around without their heads on. The owner's son came over a few times and chatted with us and all the food was served hot and in unison. 

So, you might be wondering how I could give a 5 Star rating to a restaurant in the middle of a dead strip mall?  Okay, I confess this is a pretty good place, like 2 1/2 star Michelin good!  And, the last time I looked we're evaluating the food and not the location. 

I can also understand that some have a beef with a place that serves very good food at Kierland Common prices.  But, did we feel it was unjustified, no.

In summary, I would say great food at a fair but high price that offers good value.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Casa Mia is the only life left in an otherwise deserted strip mall at 136th and Via Linda in Scottsdale.  The fact that it has survived when everything around it has died is a testament to the quality of the food and service.  The pasta is excellent.  My favorite dishes are the seafood pasta and the homemade sausage.  My wife enjoys the pasta bolognaise and several of the veal dishes. Everything appears to be home made and that takes extra time so expect to pay more then you would expect.  As an example a moderately sized serving of pasta is $20 with most of the entrees in the $20-$30 price rage.  So if you want to splurge a bit on some of the best Italian food in the valley, go to Casa Mia."}
{"text":"Very disappointed
Service was terrible and when they delivered my check the waiter informed me that that already added the gratuity to the bill? Very strange since we only had 3 people in my party, I questioned their charging me 25 % tip and they responded that it is customary . I don't think so and I will never go back here again. We had pasta and it ended up costing us 130 dollars, ridiculous. And the pasta was OK
I think think the restaurant is in obvious financial trouble. I don't see this restaurant lasting to long shifting financial burden to their customers"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to dine in this lovely establishment last night and it was amazing. I was greeted by a lovely bartender when I walked in and he whipped up some great beverages. Lets not mention how one of my friends was clumsy enough to spill an entire beverage and drench my dress in Gin. 
Once seated I ordered the Fresh pasta with Bolognese sauce. I must admit - I do not think I have ever tasted something so fresh. The meat was super tender,just the right spice and sweetness to the tomatoes. Outstanding will be my word of choice to describe this dish. 

My friend ordered the risotto with calamari, squid, and scallops. This dish was overloaded with seafood, so tender and happy. Oh My!!

My other friend ordered the fresh house made cheese Ravioli which was all made fresh in house. I can see now, the little old adorable Italian mothers hand stuffing pasta pillows with cheese - oh my mouth waters just to reminisce.  
All three dishes were beyond amazing. I don't think I have had Italian this good in years.

PLEASE go and taste the beauty of real authentic Italian - the way it should be made."}
{"text":"Wonderful Italian in this Scottsdale gem...you feel like you've stepped into Italy in this Strip mall restaurant...  Wonderful food and service.  It's a bit pricey though or sit at the bar and enjoy a talk with the locals."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner with a very large party. The service was fantastic. We ordered pasta, chicken and seafood dishes. All were very fresh and tasty. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of people tonight and ordered numerous appetizers, entrees, desserts and of course a couple bottles of wine. Everything was absolutely delicious and the staff was very attentive and pleasant. I'm from New York so I know how difficult it can be to find a legit Italian restaurant here in Arizona that isn't a mock-up. If you're looking for AUTHENTIC Italian food then this is it. MANGIA!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday and the owner greeted us at the door.  We got a table right away. We ordered the caesar salad, bruscetta , and fried calamari.  The bread was good.  The red wine was good. Palazzo Dr Calls.The salad was okay. We got it without the anchovies. That may have made it bland.  The bruscetta was okay. The toasted bread was hard to bite and had burnt spots on it. The tomato mixturfresh but missing something so I added some balsamic vinegar to give it more flavor. The calamari was light and good.  It was the homemade tiramisu and cappuccino that really made the dinner.  If I go again I will skip the bruscetta and salad and order a pasta instead.  I will try the homemade pumpkin pie and get another tiramisu for sure."}
{"text":"Food, service, and decor here are really top-notch. Run by a family who really knows their stuff. The fact that it is located where it is, makes it even more amazing how great it is. But, what separates this place from every other similar place, is the bar program. Monkey 47? Cynar? Carpano and Punt y Mes? Fresh pressed juices? Original cocktails? Go here early and often."}
{"text":"The restaurant is cozy and stylish.  I got there early and sat at the bar. I ordered a California Chardonnay and later, an Italian Chardonnay.  Both were good and chilled well.  The service was very friendly.  I ordered the Mista Salad and a special pasta, Tagliatelle with lamb ragu.  Excellent!  The bread was fresh and the dessert (I had spumoni) was perfect.  You would be hard pressed to get Italian food more delicious and authentic than this.  The prices were reasonable, certainly appropriate for the high quality of food.  If you're looking for great Italian food in a nice, intimate restaurant, this is your place."}
{"text":"I live nearby and I wish it were not so, but I just cannot recommend this restaurant.  The room and the bar have charm. The concept is welcome as it is the sole place of it's kind in this area, still I am truly saddened to write this review.

I was part of a party of 12. We opted for a late seating on Saturday night. Upon arrival there were 3 tables finishing their meals and no one in the bar.  The semi open kitchen appeared fully staffed, based upon previous visits.

The manager made an attempt to connect with us, however he just doesn't really pull it off, this an observation I made on 2 separate visits. 

The menu isn't bad, it does offer quite a bit of choice but the food wasn't great with some pasta overcooked and others undercooked. I ordered spaghetti fruiti de mari. The seafood content was barely adequate and relied too heavily on squid. It did not have enough scallops, muscles  and shrimp to set it apart from just ordinary.  The pasta was undercooked, the sauce tasted a little like it included Campbell's canned tomato soup, something my mother once whipped up when I was a poor child, a long long time ago. A party member had a rib eye and the price simply choked him later on.  

The wine list is pathetic. It is highly unlikely that even a savvy Italian wine enthusiast can make an intelligent selection here and find a great tasting wine. All no name vineyards. Through the evening, we ordered  a of couple of different whites and reds, none of them had any remarkable or memorable qualities. Further, all are grossly over priced. Wine has the potential to overcome mediocre food, alas not here. 

Desert included sorbet and tiramisu,  they were not bad, but in no way evoke any memories of northern Italy.  Remember this family claims authenticity here... Really? I think they are justifying the really expensive tab that on the last two occasions I couldn't  feel good about when heading home from Casa Mia. 

So it's a poor value and overpriced.  Renegade on 96th and Shea is a much more suitable choice in this area. The food there is fabulous."}
{"text":"This was the first time back since they reopened several years ago from the old location next door.  The ambiance is lacking, very cold, all cement floors.  The old bar was welcoming but this one is not at all. We ordered the Papardelli with scallops for $29.00, the 6 tiny scallops were small and rubbery, the pasta was too Al dente for our liking. We were never asked how our meal was after it was served, overall a disappointing visit when we were so looking forward to one of our old favorites."}
{"text":"This place is 5/5! It has some of the best Italian Ive ever had in the US. The dinner is incredible! I usually get the veal with prosciutto and mashed potatoes. My wife gets the bolognas, both are very very good. It is a little pricey but the food is worth it 100%!!! The atmosphere is perfect for a dinner with your spouse or family. Go here now!"}
{"text":"This is such a classy place. We both had the specials tonight. A grass fed veal chop with marsala mushroom sauce. Tim had the homemade fusilli with eggplant and ricotta sauce. They fly in their own buffalo mozzarella cheese for their captures dish! Finished off the meal with a lemon sorbet in a lemon!!! Out of this world and a must try."}
{"text":"A first class Italian eatery.  Definitely leans towards the northern Italian cuisine.  Was with a large party, so got to try several dishes.  All were very good.  From the grilled shrimp appetizers, to the two types of salad, to the entrees, everything was prepared very well.  While I don't personally eat dessert, I have it on very authoritative information (read that \"my wife\"), that the tiramisou was delicous.  The ambience is very family oriented, and the owners and wait staff were  incredibly attentive, without being intrusive."}
{"text":"We really loved the atmosphere.  The owning family is Italian so the food is authentically good.  We loved the owner/lady who made our experience fun.  I prefer the antipasta and pasta at Andreolis but the secondi here were excellent.  While this is an excellent restaurant the price was offputting.  We are regulars of Andreolis and Trattoria Veneto (both owned and managed daily by real Italians) and I would say that Casa Mia was close to twice the price of those."}
{"text":"I've lived next to Casa Mia for years now and I've only been there once! I definitely plan on stopping in more often. The food reminds me so much of being in Italy again and the service is on point. They are very welcoming and make you feel like you are right at home."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food so close to my house, really enjoyed my dinner here.

Started dinner with octopus salad (not on the menu but was special on that day). Really loved that tangy salad dressing. Portion size is large, could possibly just have that for dinner. Good octopus should have nice texture and theirs had that. 

I was going to have pasta but decided to go with gnocchi after seeing the list of cheese they use. Gnocchi was prepared perfect. Combination of cheese and quality cheese with nice texture of gnocchi made this dish so good. 

Casual ambiance, fancy price, excellent service and great food. I couldn't drink on this particular night I came in but a table next me had a bottle of wine. Based on wine glass I saw, I am looking forward to coming back to pair my dinner with a nice glass of red wine."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food. The best in scottsdale. Try the tortellini alla boscaiola. This is my favorite thing on the menu. They just moved into a new location the decor is modern and trendy. It's a little out of the way but worth the drive. If you're looking for amazing Italian food go here."}
{"text":"Some of the best authentic Italian food in AZ. Chic modern ambiance. Great place for a date or casual dinner with family/friends."}
{"text":"Disappointing night in a great local place 
My wife and I are great fans of Mia Casa 
Last night we had dinner   Food was great server was distracted and in attentive 
We don't expect wait staffs undivided attention but when he comes to the table twice in the course of dinner something is wrong .
It was a busy Friday night but it was not swamped 
Again the food was great the service was below average   It's a good restaurant with a nice menu but they need to tighten the expectations on the staff"}
{"text":"Read the reviews and tried Casa Mia. Cannot fathom why anyone would think this is a worthwhile Italian restaurant. First off, the service is poor because the management is trying to save costs--the only active business in a dead strip mall. Waited for a long time and the employees were rude and terse. The food is not much better than a Romano's experience and far too pricey. Order a seafood pasta and the seafood was old and smelly. Desserts were not Italian....some hybrid of something.  The four of us spent a total of $121.00 and felt the price was far more than it should have been. There is a reason why the restaurant is where it is rather than in Kierland or on Scottsdale Road like the Veneto Trattoria. Avoid it like the plague."}
{"text":"A seriously wonderful restaurant. Family owned & operated. Everything is wonderful on this menu. They will specialize anything for you if they can. The pizza restaurant next door is phenomenal. Once you have their pizzas there is no going back to traditional pizza , no matter how good they are. These are just different & wonderful. 
Love everything about these restaurants including the owners. We eat there or take out from them at least twice a week. Since I am a food \" PITA\" it has to be great !! Don't miss these gems."}
{"text":"This is probably the biggest surprise. 
A couple of friends invited me to this Italian restaurant and, being Italian, I was not very excited as I am very picky. 
Casa Mia is absolutely fantastic from the burrata to the tuna tartare to the tortellini. The food was fresh, delicate and delicious. The tortellini pasta was thin and the ripieno was like a classical symphony of tastes. 
The wine list includes a wide variety of wines including one of my favorites, Falanghina. 
Outstanding, I'll be going back soon!!"}
{"text":"Only read this if you want to be amazed!  Of my hundreds of reviews this is definitely top 10 Italian outside of Italy. Service was spot on and delivered with a wonderfully authentically thick Italian accent.   We began with capresee and mozzarella and of course calamari. You can stop reading now. They were both so delicious we would drive across town, order nothing else, and feel satisfied. But we kept ordering... Taglatle with a meat sauce from heaven. It was so thick with delectable meats, I'm not sure there was any tomatoes. (Yes there was a hint of tomato in there somewhere). We also shared linguine and clams in white sauce. Pasta 85259 was a signature dish featuring chicken and mushrooms. Stop reading it gets better. Get out the doggie bags. The tortellini was probably the best anyone has ever tasted.  PERIOD! So if you fly into Scottsdale for fun or business this is an intimate way off the beaten path hidden gem. Family owned an operated. Opens at 5pm. They take reservations and you'll need em. Maybe 20 tables at most. I'm pretty certain I've given no more than 10 5star ratings in my yelp career. These folks are amazing! Just the best!"}
{"text":"Perfect food. Perfect people perfect family. This is one of the Finest true Italian Bistros in the valley. You must make it a regular destination."}
{"text":"Best in or near Fountain Hills by a LONG shot. Great ambiance, sketchy service on occasion. Super fresh food though, high quality. EXPENSIVE...but worth it. Can't miss."}
{"text":"This restaurant has gone downhill over the years. We used to go there almost every week, but the service is horrible now. The food is definitely not worth the cost...it is subpar, and they left out items, such as sauce and potatoes!  Too many good Italian restaurants around to put up with poor food and service."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for dinner and omg. It was. Incredible. We just moved down the street and had to try this family owned Italian restaurant! All the pasta is handmade and everything is so fresh. We started off with the beef carpaccio which was good but honestly was not enough for 4 people. I ordered the cauliflower and spinach soup which I really loved. Then we all got our own pasta I ordered the tagliatelle bolognese which I loved. My hubby got the veil I believe wrapped in prosciutto which was SO good. Everyone loved their meal and the portion was great. 

For dessert we ordered the chocolate lava cake which was good but we had to re order without the raspberry sauce (our server was super nice about it) and the coconut sorbet and this chocolate vanilla sorbet I believe which was my fav. 

The service was fast, the ambiance was so relaxing and dim we loved it. We will totally be back I can't even get over the pasta. Love."}
{"text":"Just had dinner the home made sausage was out standing!

Everthing they do is fantastic, you would think yuor own mom is in the kitchen cooking.
For the BEST Italian food in North Scottsdale you have to try tese guys!!

Also ask for the \"piggy\" wine it is our favorite!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten all over the world italian cuisine. As a native of Brooklyn New York and having many italian friends and neighbors I have to say I've never tasted better Italian food."}
{"text":"Sorry to do this folks, although I enjoyed the atmosphere, I can't say I enjoyed my main dish and hence the two stars. I order lamb.  I asked for medium rare and I got cold well done.  My mash potatoes were cold and hard, not smooth and silky at all. The whole freaking plate was cold. I told the waiter and he did nothing about it. Had it not been that I was hungry, I would have not eaten it. 

The soup was fine and had a good flavor, but again clearly sitting on the servers area too long as it too wasn't hot as it should have been. The Cheese and tomatoes were great!

The martini's were fabulous. The service was just okay. They need to adopt a tag team style of service instead of one guy serving us all the time and frankly not taking care of us as we should be when one spend $160. 

But I do like the decors, seating, etc. I may give it another try."}
{"text":"My husband & I don't go out often just the 2 of us. We decided to go to Casa Mia for a date nite. Just wanted to sit at the bar for cocktails & dinner. We arrived 5 min after they opened & were their 1st customers. There were a few \"Reserved \"seats posted at bar so we asked & took our seats. We have NEVER felt so UNWELCOME in a place in our lives. The blond lady bartender even said we would b asked to move. Guess we aren't LOCAL enough to be welcome at this restaurant. We tipped her nicely trying to get on her good graces but to no avail...another couple walked in & she said she texted them to wait 15 min for a spot at bar...our spot obviously! Food was fabulous but will never go back nor recommend...SHE just isn't worth it. Oh...& in her haste to get us out of there...she never even brought my glass of wine with dinner. Plenty of other places to go that will welcome our business..."}
{"text":"Moved into the area not too long ago and have been scouting around for the best and most authentic cuisines. Casa Mia did not disappoint. The food was delicious as well as artfully presented. Portions were perfect. Service was friendly with some great suggestions. Wines were very good. 
I have to say that it was one of the best restaurant meals we enjoyed out since moving here. We already know we are going back next week!"}
{"text":"Awful.  Pasta over cooked.  Chicken over cooked, tough. Nerve to serve chicken with boxed potatos and canned beans.  Overpriced.  Horrible,  
Expesnive cars in lot.  Must be from Chicago burbs.  Downtown people would neve eat at this shitty place."}
{"text":"From the second we walked in I knew I was going to be in for a treat. My dad and I had the salmon and lamb chop specials, I wouldn't have changed one ingredient. Being one coming from a family owned Italian restaurant, good Italian food is hard to come by in Scottsdale. Happy to say we found it here at Casa Mia! We finished the night with an amazing espresso and their homemade flowerless chocolate cake. Simply amazing"}
{"text":"Be warned, they do a bait and switch on wine among other things.

We had such a disappointing experience at this restaurant. I booked for 3 online and in the notes section where it asked if we were celebrating anything special I said we were celebrating a birthday. One friend treated us to a bottle of wine and ordered a bottle of 2007 red ( I don't remember what it was) but it was $130.  She had a full conversation with the owner about the two different wines that she was debating between and the owner suggested that she get the Barolo or whatever it was. When it came, the waiter poured it and she noticed that it wasn't a dark enough color and it didn't taste as she expected then she looked at the label and found it was a 2011. So the waiter tried to pass it off without telling her. When she asked about this, he gave some long winded excuse about their supplier etc... To bait and switch and not say anything and then when caught make up an excuse is unacceptable and the owner even knew this. My friend didn't want to make a big deal of it at dinner and ruin the mood so we took the bottle. When we asked for a decanter he told us that the glasses we were drinking out of were decanter glasses.  Do those even exist? Why argue about bringing a decanter? My friend obviously knows wine and even if she didn't, bring it anyway, whether it is a $30 bottle of wine or a $130 bottle of wine, we are the customers and if we want a decanter bring one.

Dinner, I ordered the gnocci, the only one on the menu:  Asiago, smoked mozzarella, parmigiano and swiss cheese. What I got was a plate of gnocci covered in tomato sauce with some cheese under it.  I pointed it out to the female server who also happened to be the owner and she said, Oh, you want it with cheese? I said, that was the one I ordered. So I sat and waited for my meal to come out while my friends were already halfway into theirs.

There was no second round of water brought to the table and it was only when I got up to get some myself that I was noticed and asked what I wanted. When my second gnocci came, no one came to check to see how it was or how any of our meals were. I did find it a bit salty but I wouldn't have sent it back.

As we sat there, a party next to us had a desert come out with a candle and the table sang happy birthday. When we finished dinner we were asked if we wanted coffee or desert and when we said no, we received our bill. No discount, no apology for bringing the wrong wine, no offer of a shot of limoncello, nothing. My other friend who didn't order the wine then said to the waiter that he should not be charging us the full price of $130 for the wine, he said there was nothing he could do and that we should have mentioned it before. We asked if we could speak with the owner and he said she left 10 minutes ago, unbeknownst to us at the time, she was the other server dealing with us who brought me the gnocci and recommended the wine so she was fully aware of everything that was happening at our table. My friend asked if he could call the owner and he said NO but the owner would call my friend the next day.

My friend was called the next day and the owner was argumentative even going so far as to say that we didn't have a reservation and there was no mention of a birthday. I had done my reservation on OpenTable and if they didn't know I had a reservation, how did she know to bring 3 menus to the table when I showed up on my own?  The fact that they didn't celebrate the birthday wasn't a huge deal but why bother asking if it is special occasion and it happened to be the icing on the proverbial cake.

It was such an extremely disappointing experience. I waited to write this review to see if maybe the owner would have made it right but she didn't and that speaks volumes. I will be letting my friends know who recommended this place to me know about this as they bring all their Canadian snowbird friends from out of town there. I will never be back. :(

To be fair, my friends enjoyed their meals. One had a fish dish and the other had a risotto, so at least that was a positive and the room is quite nice and cozy. Be warned though, you may get duped."}
{"text":"I was visting last week from Connecticut and got a certificate on Restaurant.com. Thank Heavens I did. I never would have known about it. My Mother is Italian and this food is excellent. Service very good, nice atmosphere. Highly recommend. I have told 3 other people about it that live in area and have not been there. I had a tomato soup and pasta and my girlfriend had veal. All great. I will be back. Very friendly crowd and great family run business. Try it you'll like it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a wonderful Italian restaurant in Scottsdale, look no further.  Casa Mia is one of my favorite restaurants for the food as well as the service.
  
The restaurant itself is located in a shopping center off of 136th street and Via Linda - the location is relatively small, but very comfortable with booths and tables a bar area, and a viewable kitchen.  The dÃ©cor is colorful with wood and blown glass throughout providing a casual and comfortable environment.  

Start with one of the house cocktails - the pomegranate martini made with Hangar One vodka is wonderful and goes down way too easy.  The soups are always fantastic, and the special is often a wonderful puree of vegetable such as cauliflower or squash.  The insalata mista is fresh and crisp with Kalamata olives, grape tomatoes and a clean vinaigrette.  There is a good selection of pasta dishes as well as entrees, and usually a wonderful ribeye on special.  

My personal menu favorites are the cheese tortellini in cream sauce with pancetta or one of the various chicken dishes which include fresh vegetables and whipped potatoes.   The food always is fresh, homemade, and piping hot - straight from the small kitchen.  End with some of the most wonderful tiramisu around and a taste of the house made lemoncello.

Being family owned you get a personal touch and can tell that they truly care about the food and the experience.  The staff and ownership are friendly and knowledgeable, and eager to make your evening fantastic.   

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food in a great atmosphere, prepared by a great chef and served by a courteous and prompt wait staff."}
{"text":"Casa Mia is probably the best restaurant in Scottsdale!  We have tried many restaurants here in Scottsdale and they aren't good.  
The food at Casa Mia is delicious.  Nothing in Scottsdale has even come close."}
{"text":"I must say they had delicious Food! I've been there3x and each time the food was great.
The timing of their service was way too slow 2x and they unfortunately were not very friendly on all three occasions. 
The food brought me back so I gave them the benefit and went a 3rd time. This visit was about 5 45 pm early dinner on a Tuesday, we felt very rushed and everything came out on top of eachother which was just too fast! As an example my salad came out way before our drinks ever showed up. 

They are unorganized and extremely unaware of patrons, which makes the dining experience not that inviting or as enjoyable... Everything was out of rythym. 

Food alone I would give them 4 stars, but on service and hospitality they only get 2 stars in my book.

I Wish they had good service and happier and welcoming staff but after 3x I think we will move on."}
{"text":"The first 2 times I went there I was mildly impressed with the food. My husband and I simply went there because it is within walking distance of our home. The martinis are substantial and the bar had a pretty impressive selection. On My third visit, I asked what was recommended, and that's when this place became my favorite Italian restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in Scottsdale! I have been coming here for 5 years and the food and service here is phenomenal. This is a family run business, and I look forward to seeing them when I visit. The restaurant is closed on Mondays.


The Martinis are lethal."}
{"text":"Good vibes , good  Italian fare, great service.  What more do I want.
My wife and I have been going there for years and never have been disappointed. Go and be happy."}
{"text":"Friends raved about this family owned restaurant so we decided invite a couple friends for dinner - nice decor & friendly staff - portions very small, several of us had mussels & clams, they were size of a nickel -  spaghetti with red sauce tasted ordinary  & saltimbocca  looked like layered lasagna without the pasta.
The bread and olive oil was the best  maybe we just ordered the wrong entrees - don't think we'll be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"CM2 is the new Pizzeria & Bake Shop in Northeast Scottsdale that will surely be at the top of the list of \"The BEST Pizzerias in the Phoenix Metro Area.\" Nantas Sodano, along with his parents, also own the legendary Casa Mia Italian restaurant next door. The Sodanos are first generation Italians who take great pride in serving all organically grown produce, and their desserts & bakery breads are made in-house. They serve authentic Italian pizzas, perfectly baked with a crispy crust and ultra fresh ingredients. 

We were raving about the truly exceptional sausage on our pizza, and Nantas told us that it is also made in-house. My favorite pizza, so far, is their \"Chuck Franklin\" with pepperoni, their special sausage, wonderful tomato sauce & cheese, vivid red peppers and thinly sliced tender onions. Also, the Margarita pizza is one of the best that I've ever had, with a fresh basil leaf on each slice. To see everything that they serve, you can check out the photo below of their menu.

The decor is rustic-contempo, the service is excellent, and they make you feel like famiglia!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Had a simple tortellini Alfredo that was so bad I had to ask for a refund & I have never done that before!  I don't know how you screw up cream & Parmesan cheese, but this was so bad it was like trying to choke down flavorless paste.  I probably would've let it go for under $15 but this was close to $30!!! 
Also I'm pretty sure a busboy was our server - the place was dead - not surprising."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Casa Mia for years!!! This is hands down one of my favorite Italian spots in the valley.  Worth the drive where ever you live! The family that owns and runs the restaurant is absolutely amazing! 

Here are just a few of my favorites: 

To start you must try the Burrata with Proscuitto. I also love the Bruschetta & can never go wrong with the Caesar salad!

For Pastas: The Linguine & clams, Gnocchi, & Spaghetti Alla Checca (recommend getting this spicy)  all three are full of flavor delicious! 

** Always find out what the specials are = never cease to amaze!!"}
{"text":"Casa Mia serves authentic Italian food.....it's like home cooking straight from Italy! Excellent selection of pastas, pizza's and desserts. Service is fantastic! We will be regulars!"}
{"text":"Looking for a delicious Italian meal? Well, look no further. This is the place to experience an authentic dish that will leave you wanting more. It reminded me of my grandmother's cooking. If you are in the Scottsdale area or even if you are not, it's worth the drive. My husband and I will definitely be coming back...and we live in New Jersey."}
{"text":"Very much enjoy this neighborhood restaurant/bar!  The food is fresh, made to order and delicious and the wine/cocktail as well.  They treat everyone well but their local regulars they treat like king and queens .......conveniently located just off Shea Blvd yet enough off to provide a retreat from our typically hectic lives.  Very authentic owners and food!"}
{"text":"Went here with my wife last night. Upon entering the restaurant, I noticed the decor was inviting, the place looked very clean - very nice ambience.

 I was looking for spaghetti and meat balls and/or Italian sausage. However, spaghetti and meat balls was not on the menu so I was forced to step outside of my comfort zone - and I'm glad I did! I had the Salsiccia Alla Cacciatora - it was DEE-LICIOUS! 

The servers were attentive without being a pain. The chef periodically walked the dining area to make sure everything was OK - again, without being a pain. 

The only down side is the price - over a hundred bucks for the two of us! That's a lot for a cheapskate like me."}
{"text":"Great ambience, food amazing and customer service unique. Industrial design with a touch of modern Italy."}
{"text":"Restaurant moved to a new location and my first time here. I heard many great reviews from friends who have been and couldn't wait you try it out. I had a tomato salad to start and was good. I tried the shrimp and scallop risotto as my main and found it mediocre. The risotto was flavorful but the rice was not so traditional. The scallops was cooked perfectly but I found the shrimp a little overdone. It was paired with a 2007 Planeta Shiraz which was nice. 

Overall, I liked the decor and the good service. I appreciated the owner hosting us and being extremely curious and friendly
L."}
{"text":"I live about 15 minutes away, and if you have lived in Scottsdale for more then a few days you know I would probably pass at least 3 italian restaurants on the way. This is by far my favorite italian restaurant...the atmosphere is great with friendly wait staff and a sense of camaraderie between the patrons and the staff. It is a little on the more upscale italian side however I believe a lot of the ingredients are shipped in from Italy. For dinner I had the pasta with blue cheese and walnuts and I have to say everytime my girlfriend wants to go out somewhere to eat that pops into my head -- excellient!

I would def have to recommend this place if you are in Scottsdale and are looking for some good Italian food."}
