{"text":"We were looking for a brunch place last weekend and the notion of Japanese-Western fusion piqued our interest.

The decor feels very 'downtown', with dark colours, clean lines, high mirrors, and a trendy eye-popping ceiling piece. Sitting by the window and watching the cars go by, it almost feels like you're eating in a small downtown place, but the illusion quickly dissipates when you notice the adjacent low-rise buildings, which are fine but lack the urban charm. 

I had the 'Okonomi' waffles, basically a seafood-esque version of the classic Western brunch staple. I found the flavor both surprising and delicious, with the seafood elements complemented nicely by the perfectly poached egg and savory pork belly. The gluten-free bread I ordered as a side was fine but quite bland and could have used some sort of accompaniment like oil or butter.

I can't speak for the other menu items, but if what I had is any indication of Carino's quality and taste, this restaurant is worth a visit."}
{"text":"We had one of the best meals in recent memory at this restaurant.  Carino was simply fantastic.  Great service and highly recommend the Duck, Duck Duck dish as well as the Waygu Tagliata and the Ramen Salad."}
{"text":"yummy food, stylish interior,good service. I love the fusion Japanese & French cuisine!"}
{"text":"Short version: eat here! Wow!

We have walked past this place a few times on our way to diner deluxe (which is incredible) but since the line up was so long at the diner, my wife suggested that we try Carino instead. 

Our minds were blown! Fantastic service, incredible food and nice ambiance. And cool music. 

I think it was the best brunch I've ever had.   We've made the quinoa waffles for friends and they LOVE them too.  I had an eggs benedict and it was incredible too.

Go there!"}
{"text":"We went in for lunch yesterday based on the earlier reviews and found a solid menu of Ramen, with a few other items. The ramen is excellent, even if the portions appear slightly smaller than comparable places. Still, a filling bowl and very tasty. 

The service was excellent, and pricing was in line with Calgary standards. They were friendly towards our infant son. We look forward to returning and sampling more of their ramen selection."}
{"text":"I love this place!  We went for the first time tonight, with friends of ours who know the owner.  I'm normally a little sceptical of 'fusion' places, but the combinations here are very well thought out, and not done for novelty sake.  

The wine is really, really good. The service was great.  The food was outstanding.  They also have something else most good restaurants in Calgary don't have - great tea!  Their tea is from Matsu Kaze, so it's all very high quality Japanese tea.  It's not on the menu, so you need to ask for it.  

Japanese restaurants that are actually Japanese-owned are hard to find in Calgary - this is one of them.  Go!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow. 
This place is incredible.
I went here with a friend on a Saturday evening, with reservations. The place is very small, so I definitely will reserve again in the future. 
To begin, we had a duck carpaccio which was lightly seared and served with yuzu and curly green onions. The only seasoning was salt and pepper. It was very simple, but incredibly delicious. I had wanted the octopus, my friend the duck, so we took the servers recommendation and ended up will the duck. Will be back to try the octopus next time! 
For our mains we decided to split two entrees, and the servers were very good about ensuring we had side plates and anything we might require. We had a miso glazed crispy chicken on edamame risotto, and a ahi tuna steak served with fussili pasta and a delicious soy dip. The marriage between Italian and Japanese was perfect, as I had a hard time envisionining it prior.
Dessert was particularly special, we shared a matcha panna cotta and a black sesame panna cotta (served/paired together). We both loved the sesame best, as it wasn't sweet and the flavor really complimented the matcha. 
There were so many delicious looking things on their menu, and even their lunch ramen menu looks worth checking out.
I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in Calgary. Consistently great food, great service, and an intimate and uncomplicated decor. 

I was back on Friday night for dinner. We had the kaiseki tasting menu for the first time. Incredible. All the flavors were subtle yet interesting. Some stand outs were the mentaiko gnocchi (pollack roe with cream) and the miso cappuccino. 

Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I went there today for the first time since it changed hands. I will be back, as it has one of the most intriguing menus I have ever seen and I would like to try the fusion plates offered.
I was looking for somewhere I could have a nice brunch by myself and had just walked in to see what was on the menu. Based on the menu alone, I decided to stay and eat as the choice is so eclectic.
I ordered the amazing sounding Fried Chicken with quinoa waffles. Unfortunately, what came out was the dessert plate of Quinoa waffles with berries, cream and ice cream ( I am lactose intolerant, so it wasn't something I would ever order). I was disappointed, but so hungry I ate the parts that I could eat and left. 
I did like the fact that they offer different flavoured mimosas, I enjoyed a nice cranberry mimosa. My server was very apologetic and I didn't want to make a big deal, despite my disappointment. I guess I will just have to go back the next time I have a 'morning off'."}
{"text":"So delish! A wonderful fusion of Japanese & Italian. Fantastic service, great wine, lovely owner who recommended the best dishes. Excellent presentation & fabulous flavour combinations. I'm glad I live close enough to walk back for more."}
{"text":"This place kept me up all night ,I hate it when I feel totally GOUGED !
I tend to write reviews after such negative experiences in hopes that others do not  get ripped off .
My back ground is 20 years of professional cooking ,3 years in a 5 star Italian restaurant in Japan.
  First of all Carino is listed to be an Italian Japanese Fusion Bistro,far from it .

We had the kaiseki tasting menu for $65 /person.Fusion in my vocab is a mixture of different seasoning ,ingredients cooking methods.
What we got was 95 %  Japanese. 

 First course   was Chawnmushi  a Japanese egg custard which was delicate , properly  executed.

  Second was two pastas served in in small Japanese Tea cups.
One being hot and fairly tasty ,the other lukewarm and under cooked.

  3rd was a small portion of Wagyu beef and one tempura asparagus.

The final menu item was listed a seafood paella .This was the selling point of ordering this 4 course  menu.So sooo disappointed to see a paella was once again a very small portion of a Japanese Maguro  donburi. Basically raw tuna , avocado and soya sauce on top of plain steamed rice. 
What ever happened to the onion ,tomato ,saffron, chicken,rabbit ,shellfish, squid or even the sausage.
The only Fusion I saw in Carino was the way the menu was written and maybe the miso latte.
The service was mediocre ,impersonal, no explanation  whats so ever of the menu or what was being presented before you.Not even a confirmation on how the food was.

As a chef, I may be more critical in my review but dinning out at Carino for  2  set me back $170.
If the meal was fantastic as the others reviews may make you believe I would not be writing this.
I ALSO WOULD NOT OF FELT LIKE EATING A BURGER AT PETTERS DRIVE THROUGH RIGHT  AFTER GOING OUT FOR DINNER.

  If you would like to try something good in this category Try VERO  BISTRO MODERNE ,I NEVER HAD A BAD MEAL THERE."}
{"text":"Interesting Italian-Japanese fusion. I really liked the Agedashi Mozzarella balls, definitely the highlight of the night. We also tried the Beef Sirloin Tagliata Rigatoni, where the beef was of excellent quality but the rigatoni part was underwhelming - plain rigatoni with Bolognese sauce that I could probably prepare myself at home. There was way too much sauce for the amount of pasta we got. We also tried the Ahi Tuna poke antipasto, which was more like a Mexican style (not Italian by any means) ceviche. Ok, but not stellar.

The dessert was the sesame/matcha pannacota, where the matcha portion was tasty but the sesame portion was bland.

Service and ambiance were both pleasant. What really got me was the price, $81 for two people? Factoring in that we had two antipasti, only one main, only one drink and a shared dessert, that is outright expensive. Although the concept is creative and unique, the menu is definitely overpriced. Not sure I would return."}
{"text":"The burger with a \"Rice\" bun was delicious! I had the Ahi Poke to start was ok the the presentation was in a high ball glass which threw me off and the chips that they made to go with it were ok.
Good decor, good music, the waitress usually only worked lunch shift so she had to run back to the kitchen more than 5 or 6 times to ask certain things. They have a decent selection of alcohol and corking is available which I will utilize in the future.
They \"DO NOT\" serve ramen at night only during lunch which I saw 2 different groups leave due to this fact.
All in all a good meal that was a touch on the high"}
{"text":"Fusion restaurants can be hit or miss, especially when the flavors of the fusion are quite different - in this case, Japanese and Italian. But I'd seen and read a lot of good things about Carino and wanted to try it out.

One can't go wrong with calamari or fried cheese (mozzarella agedashi), so we got those as starters (those are a must try!) Two of us went with the pork with saffron risotto for our mains, while the other two got the soft shell crab risotto.

My main originally listed asparagus but it came out with a boy choy for a substitute, which I think worked better with the pork. But I think rendered fat from the pork overwhelmed the risotto and you couldn't really taste the saffron which was a shame.

The soft shell crab risotto wasn't really well received, having a whole fried crab on your plate isn't visually appealing.

Carino has the right idea for the fusion, I'm thinking the execution on other dishes may be better so I'd like to try them again before I make my decision on how I really feel about the food here."}
{"text":"This place was a great find. We recently went here as a group of 8...we took up a good 2/3rds of the seating here. The service was good and knowedgable. The food was amazing - from my perspective. I had the \"meatloaf\" which was served on a skewer overtop of saffron rice with a \"inspiring\" egg. I wasn't sure what the gg would do for the dish but it really made it in my opinion. I ate every last bite. My partner on the other hand had the \"Duck\" three ways and was less than impressed. He said it was okay, but was still hungry afterwards and felt that there should have been something else with the meal...too much duck?

We both really enjoyed the \"french kiss\" appy too (beef tongue) which surprised me because I wasn't sure if I'd like it. But again, we ate it all.

The place is cozy -  Im thinking I'd have enjoyed the experience more as part of a duo or smaller group. Regardless of that though it is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Little gem in the Bridgeland area.  Reasonably priced, and decent portions.  Probably the best Kobe beef burger I have had in North America, super impressed even though it probably wasn't real \"Kobe\" beef.  Will definitely be back to try more of the interesting menu, you don't see Japanese/Italian fusion very often!"}
{"text":"Great spot!!  The menu, the decor - fantastic.  Same prices as the bland food nearby..."}
{"text":"Ramen for Lunch

I love coming here for ramen at lunch (ramen is only served during lunch not dinner). It's a modern renovated house made restaurant, with free parking in the back. The front end staff are very friendly. They have traditional miso ramen (bbq pork, bean sprout, cabbage, corn bamboo shoots, boiled egg and seaweed $13.5) and some more creative bowls like the one I am trying today Shio-Genovese (bbq pork, pancetta, cherry tomatoes, bean sprouts, mozzarella cheese and foam $12). Price range from $11-$18. Today I am also enjoying some premium cold brewed Japanese yuki oolong tea $5 bottle (yuki means organic in Japanese; I just learned). They don't take reservations, It's first come first serve. 

Don't do takeout here. It's a small restaurant, I get the feeling they don't do takeout often. They charge an extra $1 per bowl for packing. The last time I got takeout the styrofoam container holding my soup ending up getting punctured and the soup leaked everywhere. When I called back it was a long conversation of relaying messages back to the kitchen to finally get them to agree to give me some more soup."}
{"text":"My Son and I went to Carino yesterday for a Remembrance Day Brunch, it was maybe 12:30 the restaurant was half full, easy to get a seat especially on a weekend aolng Edmonton Trail people are flowing into the streets. Fast Friendly service, crazy funky menus. My son had the waffle and chicken breakfast and i had the eggs bennie. Delicious brioche under my eggs ans the quinoa waffles were to die for!"}
{"text":"I think this is a very clever choice for a location. A block or two away from OEB, and across the street from Diner Deluxe can only mean one thing: all the frustrated overflow traffic from those two breakfast places just saunter over to Carino, which happens to be mostly empty!

And that is exactly what I did this morning. I had just picked up my family from the airport, and we were starving. Not wanting to wait for our food, we decided to give Carino a try. 

Carino is where AKA Winebar used to be. As we walked in, it struck me how similar it looked to AKA. They had not done much in the way of making it look different, and had left most of the decor exactly the same. Upon surveying the menu, I recognized a few brunch menu items which were the same as AKA as well. Had they decided to carry over those items into the new menu because they were popular? That is what I can assume.

One thing that bothered me before I even ordered was the strong smell that hit me as soon as I walked into the restaurant. I have a strong sense of smell, so that may be why it was so unnerving for me, but it took a lot of effort for me to look past it. But it was snowing outside and we were already seated with menus in our hands, so I decided to trudge through it. 

I ordered an Eggs Benedict with salmon gravlax, while the other parties at the table ordered the Arigato Omlette, and Fried Chicken and waffles (a menu item that was carried over from AKA Winebar). We were served coffee promptly, and it was good coffee too. 

The food arrived, after a slightly long wait. The quantities didnt look plentiful, but the presentation was pretty. My Eggs Benedict was cooked PERFECTLY. The yolks were soft and runny, and the hollandaise sauce just the right amount. 

The Arigato Omlette was interesting.. a thin omlette over some rice, bean sprouts and japanese sauce. Very tasty and filling! 

The chicken and waffles seemed to be the lesser loved of all the items. 

The price was pretty average. About $69 plus tip for all four of us.

Verdict: Would I be back? Maybe. The menu was small, but the items were well-prepared. If OEB and Diner Deluxe both had a lineups out the door, I'd happily come back to Carino. 


Review #15 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"Hidden gem for sure.  Drove by looking for Sushi and my girlfriend told me that this place was good.  Came in and sat down to look at getting my fish-fix.  Modern looking room which is perfect for an intimate meal escape with a date or partner.  We actually did not get sushi, as the menu was Western Fusion, but the flavours were monstrously appetizing, the only real problem I had was the serving size.  They are smaller as any gourmet meal should be, but to be honest, less is more in this case, and it worked out that my hungry man craving was more than satiated.  

I'm definitely going to return to try more fun stuff on their menu.  

The customer service was great to our table as well.

We went for the four course meal, which didn't work out to be too expensive!"}
{"text":"This is a neat little place with modern decor.  My friends and I went for lunch on a Saturday and we were lucky to get a table for 6 people.  Moments after we sat down, this place was packed with people.  

I believe this is an Italian restaurant infused with Japanese food...ok, better yet, i should say this is an Italian and Japanese crossed over restaurant.  It definitely is different and interesting.  

I ordered their Fried Chicken & Quinoa Waffles for lunch.  The chicken was delicious but the waffles was a bit on the drier side.  The presentation was very thoughtful.  Before each meal was served, they give a small salad which I thought was very nice and refreshing.

Service was alright.  It was kind of weird that our waitress did not come back and asked us if we needed anything else after our meal was served. Other than that, I think this place is interesting enough for me to go back and try their dinner menu!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, wine and exceptional service.    Every dish recommended was superb.     I highly recommend this restaurant.    Reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Carino has an interesting menu, the servers are pretty friendly, both my husband and I thought the food are just okay, with its taste and portion, Carino is definitely overpriced!"}
{"text":"Japanese and Italian food make the prettiest couple.

I've been to Carino twice both for dinner and brunch. And both times I've been impressed by their decor, service, ambience, and of course, the food.

Rather than ramble on about the many dishes that can be found at Carino I will describe two dishes, one from each of my visits. Dinner: I had an experimental octopus ragu on pasta. Simple and tasty yet it's a dish I've never heard of and Google thinks I'm typing a bunch of crazy words. Brunch: Okonomiyaki Waffles. The waffles seemed textbook but adjusted just right to compliment the Royal Rumble of dried fish flakes, japanese mayo, and everything else that made Okonomiyaki pancakes a party.

I'm almost weary of the five stars I'm giving Carino. I feel like this is a special place reserved for my kind of people. The youtube junkies with channels dedicated to Genarro Contaldo, runnyrunny, and that adorable old Japanese lady cooking with her dog...I forgot what her channel is called."}
{"text":"Carino always seems to pop up in conversation now and then with a lot of interest but never a lot of knowledge from the people who seem to bring it up... \"Have you tried Carino? No? Me neither...\" Well, it was time for me to change all that! But after going once for brunch, I'm still a little confused by it. I very much enjoyed it but I'm still a little confused.

Gabi M. and I were the first ones into the restaurant for Sunday brunch starting at 10:00AM. Right in the middle of Edmonton trail, across the street from a packed Diner Deluxe and an OEB that seemed to have more people waiting to get in than in the restaurant itself, it was odd to find a brunch spot with no line. (She'd even tell you the same thing, right here: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/carino-japanese-bistro-wine-calgary?hrid=nRSp-f0hmXDox5Q3C0wPuA)

They serve a special brunch menu that is Japanese infused with North American style brunch. I had the Loco Moco, which is a bowl of Terayaki rice with a Wagyu beef burger patty on top and then a sunny-side egg on top of that. Gabi's review is spot on - I did quite enjoy it! My egg was cooked well, the burger remained tender and juicy, the rice was good and sticky to hold a well proportioned amount of Teriyaki. The food is very well made and attractively displayed. SO why is it that all the other brunch places along Edmonton Trail were lined up, but not Carino? While their menu definitely incorporates a touch of North American brunch (mostly adding an egg to everything) to an asian menu, there's something about it that just doesn't quite seem quite fulfilling if you had your heart set on brunch. Teriyaki rice is delicious, make no mistake about it! But adding an egg on top doesn't necessarily satisfy the brunch pangs the way I hoped it would.

I'm interested in going back to Carino and trying their evening service. A Japanese Italian mix is something I feel like I can get behind for any other meal of the day.

The space looks like it's set up more for evening service than it is for brunch. Classy black chandeliers, (laminate) hard wood floors, and side booth seating give it a lounge/wine bar feel.

The service is friendly, the space is nice and the food is good. I feel like Carino is a solid bet if you're feeling adventurous for brunch and desire North American inspire Japanese dishes, and not the other way around."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch, pork belly braised in a sweet sauce on rice with green onion, served with a VERY fresh green salad in a Yusu (citrus) dressing. Very nice wine list and byob with no corkage"}
{"text":"Domo Arigato translates to \"thank you very much,\" which is exactly how I felt after my delicious Sunday brunch at Carino! 

Dale E and I were surprised to be the first customers right at 10am when Carino opened it's doors yesterday.  This was a much different experience than waiting for a table at one of the many other crowded brunch options in YYC.  The quiet was actually kind of nice, just unexpected!

We both had coffee to start.  They were out of espresso drinks on the day we were there, but the regular \"Big Mountain Coffee\" was just fine.  I ordered the Domo Arigato omelet, which is accompanied by a fresh organic green salad, and I was pleased!  Dale had the Loco Moco and seemed happy with his order as well.  These happen to be the first two items listed on the menu, so it probably makes sense to return and keep making our way down!

A table of three came in about half way through our meal... I happened to overhear that one of them ordered the Quinoa Waffles - Maccha Flavor with Fruit, and I made sure to look over when their food arrived.  It looked like quite the masterpiece.  Not sure if it tasted as good as it looked, but I'd be willing to bet it did!

If you're looking for a unique dining experience with friendly service in an intimate setting, Carino should definitely be on your list!"}
{"text":"The first place we dined at after landing in Calgary. It was well needed, after a 1.5 hour long process with our rental car. Service was a bit slow here with 2 waiters and about 6 occupied tables. The food came out about 25 minutes later after ordering. Luckily they had WiFi service to keep us occupied.

I had ordered the beef tongue ramen, it was decently good and the broth was excellent but the tongue was slightly overcooked and a bit chewy. I forgot what my girlfriend had ordered but it was also a ramen dish. 

The Japanese waffle was very filling and huge portion. There was a filet of fish in top. The flavor was interesting but definitely good. It is also something I would order only once. It taste very similar to Takoyaki octopus balls with the same ingredients and sauce.

Overall the 3 stars for good food but very slow service."}
{"text":"Went here with my Fiancé for Ramen (keep in mind they only serve Ramen for lunch). I had heard from some friends that it was amazing so my expectations were set really high. This is some of the BEST ramen I have ever had. I had the Tori-Shiro -Paitan (BBQ Chicken, Bean sprouts, Bonito Flakes, mizuna, kikorage mushrooms, sesame seeds and boiled egg). The broth was absolutely amazing! I can't recommend this dish enough. If you love ramen, you have to go here! 

Service was really fast and polite. Our waitress was so polite and attentive. Top marks! 

I can't wait to try their dinner menu! Thank you Carino, will will definitely back!"}
{"text":"Excellent presentation, imaginative dishes and caring service. Both the lunch and dinner menus are well-thought out and different enough that it makes you want to return. I did find the portions a little large, but I'm more of a variety person than a size person, so would rather try many things than have one super-sized dish. Free corkage on Tuesdays for you vinophiles!"}
{"text":"I usually do not like so much restaurants trying creative way, but this restaurant was OK though it wasn't something I expected.
We had a deep fried lamb dish and vegetable kaiseki plates. lamb was good. The sauce wasn't really tasty but it match with fried lamb well.
I think the kaiseki was more wired than it is supposed to be. I see they try something special but some of them wasn't great. Especially tempura plate was really oily and too crunchy. maybe they cooked it in the way on purpose but it just didn't work to us.
The staffs were fine but they didn't explain what dishes would be well enough so we don't expect something like cold pasta when they just say pasta.
We might try some other dishes somedays but prices are bit high so not sure."}
{"text":"I was looking to try something different when I was in Calgary visiting and decided to check out Carino Japanese Bistro + Wine, a Japanese-Italian fusion restaurant. Not as strange a combination as you may think as there are several restaurants in town that specialize in it. They have a second location, Carino Riserva, which has an even more innovative menu! Located directly across the street from Diner Deluxe, look for the restaurant with full on glass windows that you can peak inside to.

The inside is quite small but aesthetically pleasing with a modern, quaint bistro feel. We made a reservation for 8 and for a Saturday evening, it was oddly sparse. There were only a handful of tables to begin with but the restaurant cleared out quickly. We ended up being the only party for most of the night which was fine by us. Too bad they happened to have some technical issues with their music halfway through our meal, which put a bit of a damper on our meal. At least they let us split the bill which they normally wouldn't do for such a large party.

- Goma caesar salad ($13.00) - romaine, kale, fuji apple, crispy bacon and sesame caesar dressing. My sis's friend #1 ordered the caesar salad and octopus carpaccio as her meal. She was pretty happy with her salad although her one complaint was that while it looked beautiful, she had to manually cut up the romaine lettuce in order to make it edible.

- Octopus carpaccio ($16.00) - cherry tomato, arugula and yuzu-miso vinaigrette. They also have duck carpaccio on the menu, which sounded just as intriguing as the octopus. Lightly seasoned and fresh, I sampled a piece. Not the best raw octopus I've had but it was enjoyable.

- Buta shabu fennel salad ($13.00) - asparagus, cherry tomato, orange, arugula and Aka miso vinaigrette. Litaly went with the fennel salad for his appy and he let me take a few bites. Delicious! The fennel and arugula gave the salad a bit of peppery taste but that was nicely contrasted with the freshness of the tomatoes and oranges. The asparagus was surprisingly tasty too. My buddy actually liked this dish more than his entree.

- Ahi tuna poke ($16.00) - avocado, chive, tortilla chips and spicy Aka miso vinaigrette. We shared the Ahi tuna poke which wasn't bad. It's no Hawaiian poke (obviously) as there's lots of filler in it (avocado? in poke? Hawaiian grandma's are rolling in their grave). It reminded me of the poke I had at Ikemen. I'd skip it next time, especially at this price point.

- Rigatoni napolitan ($18.00) - double smoked bacon, red pepper in a Japanese style tomato sauce. Litaly's feedback was that it wasn't like anything he's had before. I'm not sure if he was the biggest fan but he did say the flavours were interesting and worth a try. Hard to please an Italian when it comes to pasta...

Another friend ordered this dish as his main without the bacon. I feel like this dish leans towards the small side as he devoured it pretty quickly and probably was still hungry. Portion size is not that big for some of their dishes, this one included.

- Fusilli with Aojiso-pesto ($18.00) - calamari, mozzarella, cherry tomato and arugula. I went with the fusilli which had a decent amount of calamari in it. The Aojiso-pesto sauce was interesting although I would have liked to see the pesto shine through more. The sauce itself was a bit too watery for my liking.

- Beef sirloin tagliata rigatoni ($26.00) - waygyu ragu, parmigiano, balsamic-mustard sauce. Sis's friend #2 wanted wagyu - I had a piece and it was tender and flavourful. Nicely sauced although I didn't get much mustard - more balsamicky if I recall.

- Duck! Duck!! Duck!!! Type.7 gnocchi ($29.00) - pan roasted duck breast, crispy confit leg and foie gras butter. Two others ordered this entree and it was my favourite thing I ate that night! Seriously, the duck breast was amazing. Than my friend O was like you need to try a piece of the confit leg - it was even better than the duck breast. Succulent, tender, delicious, there's a reason why there's so many !!! to describe their duck. SO good. It also came with some fried gnocchi, which I can't say I've had before. Interesting texture to say the least.

- Penne mentaiko pasta ($23.00) - they switched out the spaghetti to gluten free penne for my sister. Nice that there were quite a few options for my sister to pick from with help from the waitress.

- Tiramasu ($10.00) - not your typical tiramisu as it almost was more mousse style than your traditional fare.

- Cheesecake ($10.00) - my sis's friend ordered this but he didn't like it all so he gave it to three of us to share. I'm not sure why he didn't like it (he's picky!) but it was pretty delicious. Not too cheesecakey but the texture was smooth and had a nice crumbly bottom.

Happy to have tried an Italian place in Calgary with a Japanese twist. I will have to see if their sister restaurant is any better. A little more on the pricey side but I'd say it's worth a shot. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I had a strange hankering for either Japanese or Italian food for our anniversary dinner tonight, but neither cuisines were appealing to me by themselves, then along came Carino in my search. 

Carino is one of those places that I always drive by but have never gone into. I remember long ago when there used to be an adult video store located in the same area (so I always assumed the strip was shady). Nevertheless, it has been many years since that time, and I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. 

As I had been looking all day, and it was crunch time (715pm to be exact) I was easily able to make a reservation on opentable for the restaurant. Street parking is available in the area (be weary of areas where permits are required). 

The restaurant is so cute and small. It offered a perfect environment for our occasion. 

Service was slow at best, but the server was very polite and was great with recommendations.  As a one man team running the front of house, I applaud him! He was the bar tender as well, so I asked him to make me a sweet cocktail. He brought to me a strange concoction that had cherry blossoms, yuzu and sake. Quite tasty. I loved swirling the flowers around in the glass during my whole meal. 

I am in love with their calamari fritter! The batter was light, and had a great spice blend to it. Each piece remained tender and crispy the whole time we were enjoying it. In love with the spicy aioli as well, it was good enough to want to lick the bowl clean. The portion size was great for the price we paid ($12).

We were worried that the entrée portions were going to be small, but the portion sizes were perfect and the dishes were beautifully plated. 

I got the Mentaiko Cream Pasta ($23) with spicy pollock roe, baby scallops, calamari, prawns, shiso leaves, edamame and toasted seaweed. The seafood was tender and there was just the slightest kick of spicy to sauce. Not sure where the shiso leaves and edamame came into play, but it was delicious never the less. 

The bf got the teriyaki wagyu beef burger ($18) with Kinpira, mixed mushroom & wasabi mayo with rice bun, fries, Cheese ($1.5) and Crispy Pork Belly ($6).  The beef was cooked to medium rare, moist and fall apart tender. The rice bun was unique, and was a great change from a regular bun. Hard to eat with your hands; delicious to the end when mixed with the wasabi mayo. The pork belly wasn't all that crispy, but it was a good complement to the burger; could have done without it though. 

The fries were delicious on their own, unsure of what type of spices were on them though. They were crispy and hot when they arrived. Glad to know they were made fresh. 

The washroom here is in front of the entrance, and very tiny and dark. Not good for anyone wanting to touch up their makeup. Make sure not to wear any makeup that will melt during your date. 

Will be coming back here to try out their brunch menu. I kept hearing good things about it during the meal from other tables. Love their concept here and looking forward to my next visit. P.S. The server was very enthusiastic in telling tables about their second location as well! May go check them out there as well."}
{"text":"Carino... your brunch has redeemed you. Not that you were in my bad books, just that I've discovered brunch is the time I love you! How could I not when a gal can order a side of pork belly with brunch? All on its own, just like that. Three fat pieces of pork belly. How could I not when you have fried chicken and waffles for me to eat? How could I not when I want to come back for the banana bread French toast? And when your fruit salad isn't a bunch of melon and pineapple pieces but rather a delightful mixture of blueberries and strawberries? Next time I need to look closer down at the bottom right hand corner of the menu... that's where the flavoured mimosa is listed. I didn't see that on Sunday.

Calgary is a brunch city and you have a delectable brunch menu. 

And your kobe beef burger with the rice patty bun continues to be the other menu item I tell folks they've got to come try. But... who doesn't tell everyone about it after they've eaten one themselves?"}
{"text":"So they try to be creative and really give a fusion flare. 
Yes some dishes are definitely a miss, but some dishes are great.

Came here for brunch/lunch on the weekend and was excited when I saw certain items on the menu.

Had the \"okonomi\" waffle which is a take on okonomiyaki but in waffle form. I don't want to describe okonomiyaki so pls google it! hahah.   It is a savory waffle so don't order this expecting a sweet waffle.   It definitely achieved what it set out to do.  

If you're looking for a sweet waffle, order the maccha quinoa waffle - Looked very yummy! I will order this next time. :)

The yakisoba with 2 poached eggs though was.... bland.

Saw another person with confit chicken and waffles and it looked very good as well.

One thing I noticed, once you walk in there is a smell of  \"greasy kitchen\" ...they need a better ventilation system. 

(So far, things I would order again:  burger, yuzu sorbet, okonomi waffle...)"}
{"text":"Love the Loco Moco & Ramen!
And I really like that I can make reservation online and do not need to line up!

The staffs there do not say much, but they are polite."}
{"text":"I was here with a group of 8 last night and it was very cozy.  They certainly have crammed in as many tables as possible and you are shoulder to shoulder with everyone.  At the very least, it makes it easy to visit with your party.  

The menu is interesting and I enjoyed the taste adventure, but think some of the serving sizes are rather small for the price,  My spouse was hungry when we left.  We tried the Mozzarella Agedashi, which was good but not as flavorful as I'd hoped.  The meatloaf dish had a surprising and impressive presentation.  It had lovely flavors for the most part but I found it rather salty.  My spouse had the Crab Ravioli but as indicated, the serving was very small.  I shared about 1/3 of my meal with him because the risotto was pretty heavy for me but it still wasn't enough for him to feel satisfied.  

If you have a big appetite, I wouldn't suggest eating here.  I'd return with girlfriends though, as I enjoyed the wine and would give other menu items a try."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is high and the service is great.  Unique eating experience, highly recommended.  They offer corkage (can bring your own wine for a nominal fee).

They have parking in the rear!"}
{"text":"Creative menu, but food served is not consistent. There have been good visits and bad visits, as well as so-so visits in between. 

If you're in the vicinity and wanted some ramen, not the worst idea to stop by."}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday evening and it was dead, but from what I hear, breakfast/lunch is pretty busy. 
Started with the French Kiss and calamari. French Kiss was nice. There was nothing special about the calamari. I ordered the Kobe burger with mushrooms and it was super saucy and juicy. I liked it! However, the side salad was overdressed and soggy.

My friends got the set course meal: braised octopus starter, oyster starter, Lamb w/ risotto, creme brule. The octopus was strange because of the texture. I like the natural chewiness of the octopus, but braised octopus just tastes weird! The risotto was delicious and so was the lamb, and the creme brule was an excellent finish.

The restaurant is quite small, but very cute."}
{"text":"I read a review that said that the food was strange but excellent.  This is so true.  When you read the menu you wonder how the combinations of food and flavors will taste.  The results are amazing!!  This is a small, cozy neighborhood restaurant.  The service was exceptional - just the right amount of attention.  Don't miss the Duck, Duck, Duck!!"}
{"text":"It is an odd place for a Japanese reataurant - in the heart of western brunch central.  The ramen was not salty enough but good chewy noodle and soup base - a bit too fatty for my liking.  The japanese green tea was excellent.  I having been spoiled elsewhere in the world, probably won't go there for ramen but would try their other dishes.  They have breakfast menu which I think is worth try especially considering the crazy line ups on nearby brunch joints."}
