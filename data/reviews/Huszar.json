{"text":"My first few experiences eating at this bar/restaurant were positive. The food is well prepared - tasty comfort food. The owners recently brought a chef to the US from Hungary, and he seems very sweet and is obviously talented. The desserts are exceptional. I have had a pleasant relationship with the owners.  I am sharing my experience a couple of days ago because it was alarming, and I think it is important for people to know what they could potentially be walking into.   My father and I ate dinner here a couple of days ago, three days after the Presidential Inauguration and two days after the Women's March on Washington. We were the only patrons in the bar, and we had a pleasant quiet dinner. As we were finishing and relaxing with another drink, the owner, Judy, began yelling about politics at a volume and with a frenzy that was immediately alarming. This went on for almost five minutes or more, where it was not possible to get a word in to tell her that I was not interested in discussing this, so I signaled to the girl behind the bar to give us our check, we cashed out, and we left.   Frankly, I'm not sure what she was trying to accomplish. We had not spoken to her for probably half an hour, we hadn't discussed anything political with her, and we were friendly and engaging when we came in.   I personally found her behavior to be incredibly alarming, offensive, and obviously completely unprofessional. Regardless of how I feel about her political perspective, her volume, topic, and unrelenting intensity were very unpleasant, and turned what may have been a pleasant evening into an awful experience.  Incidentally, I marched in the Women's March on Washington over the weekend for hours, and I did not experience any kind of interaction - during a massive protest - that was this hostile. I'm sorry, but this was really not ok."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed lunch at Huszar on Thursday. Based on the recent positive publicity this homey Hungarian nook has received, I think lunch is a perfect option. The food was delicious, the folks were friendly, but it was very chill - we snagged a booth and relaxed. My dining companion and I both had Uborkasaláta (cucumber salad w/sour cream). Flavorful! I had the delicious Chicken Paprikás - creamy, comforting, with just enough paprika for a little kick. Dining companion had the Marhapörkölt (stewed beef) - it was restorative, after a very stressful week. But, oh my - the homemade dumplings! Reminded me of spaetzel. Delicious with both of our dishes, but I bet those little pasta pillows would be delightful with just butter and salt.   It is as of a corner Pittsburgh bar with great Hungarian food time traveled from the 1950ies to today. But better!"}
{"text":"I had previously been writing a detailed review of this restaurant but have decided that this place will crumble on its own without any help from me.   Here are the finer points tho.   Food is good,  but not great.  Server was completely untrained with no knowledge of the menu.  It took 45 minutes from the time the first entree hit the table to the last,  with many mistakes and errors in between.  Our checks took equally long to fix.  Despite our continued patience we were not offered anything by the owner,  who after a while,  quit apologizing out of embarrassment.  Also would like to point out that this new business has been open for some time now with only 2 reviews.  Normally,  I'd expect more especially when I had heard such positive things..."}
{"text":"Great place for East Euro dinning. Has a good Steel City feel in that its an older hole in the wall bar. Great food though and the workers are very casual and polite. I was really surprised by how good the good. I suggest the chicken papikash, it comes on top of tiny dumplings that just soak up the sauce."}
{"text":"Cheap and abundant. The chicken paprikas was delicious and filling. Drinks were also cheap. The waitress was patient and informative. I will definitely visit every time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This place is under new management and I met her. The new owner/manager is so friendly and really excited to bring Hungarian food to The North Shore. I love the food, and it's such a fun place to hang out."}
{"text":"We've driven by here on numerous occasions, and I'm ecstatic that we finally stopped for dinner, as we'll be back many times. We started with some fried cheese, cucumber salad and some langos on special - all three were absolutely delicious, with no shortage of sour cream across the board. I didn't eat the rice with the fried cheese as I didn't want to fill up too early.  For dinner, we went with the Chicken and Mushroom Paprikas which I managed to clean my entire plate despite being full beyond belief. We had a few Karlovackos to drink and the best part of the night was how friendly the owner and staff were. It was quiet for a Saturday night, but if they keep up this food and service I don't see that happening for long.  We got some strudel to go, which was OK, but I'm going to chalk it up to how full I was when I got home."}
{"text":"Great Food, Nice Cozy Bar, Eastern European Comfort food at its finest. The Chicken Paprika is some of the best I have had. A must stop if you like Hungarian food and a must try if you are new to this cuisine."}
{"text":"A dive bar with an ethnic menu? Good reviews? And unique Hungarian food? Hmmm.... sounds like a place to check out! And indeed, that's what we did when a friend came to town for the Marathon.  We made a reservation (was not really necessary) and used our GPS to find the place. The decor on the outside is not very promising, nor is the impression on first walking it to the place. This is the classic neighborhood bar. Somewhat dark inside; long bar on the right side of the room with some TVs showing sports about the bar; small tables along the right side; etc.  When we walked in there were three people seated on the bar stools and two tables were occupied along the left. A woman seated at the bar turned to look at us and started speaking --- turns out she was the owner or manager of the place! She took us to a table that was towards the back of the room - beyond the bar - gave us menus and told us our waitress would be along shortly, then she went back to her bar stool. Ummm....  Looking over the menu, we see that it really does feature Hungarian dishes. We started looking over them and tried to decipher some of the unfamiliar dish names and our waitress came over offering water and other drinks. We asked for the wine list and she quickly brought both. We asked for a few clarifications on the menu items and she really knew her stuff. We decided on an appetizer and continued deliberating what to eat.  A few minutes later we decided to order a soup, a second appetizer, a main dish, and two side dishes to share and were wondering about what wine to pair with it when she came back. We asked for help as we do not know Hungarian wines except for the sweet Tokajis (which were NOT going to work with this food!) and she admitted that she is not a wine drinker, but she took our order and had another server come by.  The second one, was able to help us a bit - her wine knowledge was also rather limited - but she eventually convinced us to try a dry cherry wine that she claimed was Hungarian. As it happened it really did work well with the food we ordered, even though it was not a Hungarian wine!  On to the food: We started with the fried dough appetizer - this tasted like a savory puffy doughnut and with the grated parmesan cheese on top; steaming hot; it was delicious. It was light enough that we did not feel like we overdid it on the first course! The soup was a good chicken soup with carrots, peas, and a version of Spaetzle - very tasty but not exceptional. The Chicken Palacinta was a light crepe filled with ground chicken and covered with a light tasting sauce of some kind. Not sure all the ingredients in the sauce, but the whole dish was light and flavorful. Chicken Paprikas had a pounded chicken breast that was a bit overcooked so that it was dried out, but the combination of the spaetzle that it was on with the sauce it was drenched in made up for that mistake. The whole combination was very tasty. The two side dishes that we got were also very good. The red cabbage was just sour enough to be enjoyable while the cucumber salad was sweet and vinegary and provided the perfect counterpoint to the creamy dishes.  When we stopped eating - with leftovers sitting in front of us! - our waitress came back and told us that they recently brought a Hungarian pastry chef from Hungary and that we should at least go and look at the desserts which were in a small refrigerator next to the bar. We complied. While trying to figure out what was what, the owner came over to us and introduced us to a young man sitting with her who was the new pastry chef. While he wore a Pittsburgh Penguins t-shirt, turns out his English is pretty poor so the owner translated between us. Needless to say, we had to try a few things! We ended up getting the following: Shortbread cookie with an apricot filling, covered in chocolate, with the restaurant name in white frosting - yummy! Layered cake with walnut layers held together with an apricot filing and topped with a chocolate ganache - yummy! Dobos Torte - yummy!  In other words, contrary to our initial impressions, the food was really good, the desserts were outstanding and we heartily recommend the place to all comers!"}
{"text":"I live in an area that is a bit lacking in the ethnic restaurant department, so I was very excited to eat here while visiting. I wasn't disappointed. We started out with the fried cheese and the crepe as starters. Both were exceptional. I could have easily eaten 3 more of the crepes. For my entree, I had the chicken paprikas. Very nicely done. Lastly, we took dessert to go. All the desserts that were available were throughly explained to us. All were delicious, and tasted very European because they weren't super sweet. The service was very friendly and on point. I wish we had this restaurant in our area."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant with a lot of heart. I spoke with the owner, who is very nice and welcoming. Huzsar is dedicated to their memory. She remodelled the place and brought in a Hungarian chef. It's a quaint neighborhood bar with some restaurant seating. The food is authentic and delicious.   The service was excellent, my server was attentive and was able to make some great recommendations from the menu.  I was particularly delighted to find a number of vegetarian options, all very reasonably priced.  They have some cool craft beers on tap. I'm not sure why they don't have Hungarian beers, but I did try an unusual Croatian beer.  In summary, great Hungarian food in a welcoming, friendly corner bar."}
{"text":"Delicious food, warm staff, friendly patrons, boisterous music and musicians! Do your research on Hungarian food, so you know what to expect. It isn't a terribly sophisticated palate, but delicious and hearty, especially good on a cold night in winter. Soups, stews and meats abound. The deserts were fabulous. Bull's Blood wine is quote potent and bold, like the name."}
{"text":"Came here after a game at PNC park as all the nearby restaurants were packed. This was an amazing find. Total comfort food with amazing taste as well as reasonable prices. They also have an amazing dessert selection. If I lived in Pittsburgh I'd be eating here all the time. Service was outstanding as well."}
{"text":"First time eating at an Hungarian restaurant and the food was stellar! While visiting for the weekend and staying close by, I saw the pictures folks have posted and my mouth was watering immediately. I started with sharing the fried cheese with rice and a sour creme sauce. The inside of the cheese wasn't hot, which I was hoping for, but the sauce and rice were fantastic. I wouldn't order it again, but I'm glad I tried it. The Chicken Paprikas blew my mind and my belt buckle 2 sizes. Hefty portion, aesthetically pleasing presentation, and overall delicious, not to mention the very reasonable price! Our server was sweet and so was the rest of the staff."}
{"text":"This place is currently the best-kept culinary secret in Pittsburgh.  They have a Michelin-rated chef.  The owners are clearly passionate about their Hungarian culture.  It is a little crowded on Hungarian music night but the food and service are topnotch."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for it's interesting menu and the live string quartet and my friend, less interested in these finer aspects of an experience, just wanted beer and some screens to watch the basketball game and I was like YUSSSSSS.. HUSZAR FTW!! They scored on all counts - Great Croatian beer and two big TVs screening the basketball game so my friend was happy. AND for me, the absolutely enjoyable live band playing traditional and folk Hungarian tunes, the Hungarian wine that my waitress recommended as well as the crowd which despite mostly being regulars was so welcoming and friendly. Soon after we walked in and were taking in the sights and sounds, a Hungarian-Croatian couple struck up a conversation with us, welcoming us and asked us if we were going to eat. We must have looked doubtful because they quickly told us that the food is amazing and we shouldn't miss dessert! I'm glad I took her advice!! :) It's telling when customers welcome you, and tell you to come back again, that they are proud of their little neighborhood joint and it's story as if it were their own. The service was great - We missed last call for ordering dessert but our waitress very kindly accommodated us and we were able to eat one of their yummy Hungarian style crepes with apricot jam and rum. The food had plenty of vegetarian options for me. I shared the friend cheese appetizer with my friend and had the mushroom paprikas for my entrée - A1! Like I said, not one aspect of my experience here was sub-optimal. I will be going back for sure and highly recommend this place, especially on a Thursday when the Gypsy Strings are playing. We went at around 9pm, so we found seating easily but I was told that an hour ago, the place was PACKED and we would have had to stand. You could make reservations though! And I'll pass on what I was told when I walked in - You don't wanna miss dessert! :)"}
{"text":"Oh my! The food here will surprise you. It is very tasty. Order anything on the menu, it's all good!!! The fried cheese is something you will come back for again and again! All the flavors on our plates were very impressive. Judy, the owner is very pleasant as well as our server. This is going to be a hot spot....my only disappointment, no music playing. We could hear every word of every conversation in there. Some nice Hungarian music maybe? I did notice a juke box on my way out, that needs to change...."}
{"text":"I'm certain most people have no idea what Hungarian food is. Sure, you've probably heard of  or even had \"goulash\".  But I assure you, that barely scratches the surface of this tasty, real comfort food cuisine. I consider myself a subject matter expert on Hungarian food. A dubious distinction you say? Ha. Taste the food at Huszar and then say that. I grew up with Hungarian food, my Hungarian grandmother taught me to make some dishes (along with a few curse words), and I've sought it out in my decades of travel domestically and internationally. I've eaten it all my life and even in Budapest. I can assure you I know legit Hungarian cuisine. This place has legit food. Full of flavor, comforting, appealing on every level, and a pure taste sensation.   I was able to talk at length with the owner, Judy. She brought the chef out to introduce him to us. She recruited him in Hungary last year and convinced him to come over. He is doing fabulous things in that kitchen. We started with some red cabbage and cucumber salad appetizers. Both incredible. On to the chicken paprikas and porkolt. Awesome. Finished with the real test - sour cherry strudel and cottage cheese palacsinta. They were perfect   We each had a Joe IPA draft (from Oregon) - haven't seen that beer anywhere around here. Delightful.   Sure it may not be the high end restaurant you may normally seek out. This is a bar with great food. Solid 4 plus stars. Next time you're thinking you'd like some ethnic food, pass on those Italian, Indian, middle eastern, Chinese thoughts. Go for comfort. Get to Huszar. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Great little place in the north side.  Great apps, great dinners and amazing desserts.  It's an old school bar with a low key vibe.  The food absolutely great.  The dessert is amazing!"}
{"text":"Hungarian Goulash - a beef stew with potatoes, tomatoes, and traditional seasonings - 4 stars. Transylvanian Wooden Platter - chicken, pork, steak, fried potatoes, and side salad - 3.5 stars. Steak - grilled eye of round steak, onions, and fried potatoes - 3.5 stars. Apple strudel - did not taste fresh - 2 stars. Krémes - lady lock dough, vanilla custard, and whipped cream - not made in-house - 5 stars."}
{"text":"Our visit here happened because there was a long wait at another local restaurant.  I called and was told they could accommodate our party of 5 (including a toddler) immediately.  Done.    Little did we know this would turn out to be maybe even a little better than the dinner we had planned on.    We each had something different and there was not a bad thing on our table.  The waitress was insanely accommodating and helped us through the menu.  Our 2 year old was in love with the cheesy dumplings they made just for her.    Overall the food was delicious and authentic.  They have a full bar with imported features.  Service was fantastic and atmosphere was welcoming.  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is a classic Eastern European heritage yinzer bar. If you're part Hungarian, you've probably been here many times.   I don't have anything bad to say about this place and if you want a pile of meats get the platter. It's huge and worth it!  The one thing I do know is the red pepper sauce they make homemade is amazing. I forget the name of it, but if it doesn't come with your meal, definitely ask for it!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Friday nights ago with my wife for dinner.  We found out about Huszar from an article in Pittsburgh Post-Gazette which my dad ripped out for me.  Having just been to Budapest this past summer my wife and were eager to eat some authentic Hungarian again.  The outside of Huszar is quite inconspicuous and I have been past it a number of times since it took over from The Recovery Room and never noticed it was there.  The inside isn't that impressive either with a bar on one side of the restaurant and some seating on the other with a little more towards the back.  Whenever we walked in we were surprised whenever we were asked whether we had reservations.  We did not and so they offered us a hightop table which we declined to sit at the bar.  We ended up sitting next to a lady who I think was the owner.  She had been to Budapest 44 times and so we both talked about our experiences.  For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to start off by splitting the Rantott Sajt.  This was fried cheese accompanied by a Hungarian tartar sauce and some white rice.  The fried cheese in the dish was good as the outside was crispy and the inside nice and gooey.  While I originally thought that the rice was a weird addition to the dish I soon found out that it played well with the tartar sauce which had a interesting and somewhat sweet flavor.  Then for my entree I decided to go with the classic chicken paprikas while my wife went with the Putsza Steak.  My entree consisted of stewed chicken with sour cream paprika sauce over top of dumplings. The chicken in my dish had some good flavors with a nice little kick in the finish which I enjoyed.  The  dumplings (nokedli) were also really good and if you have never had them before they may remind you of very tiny gnocchi.  My wife's dish was a pork cutlet that had potato pancake breading on it.  I was impressed that the breading really tasted like potato pancakes and that it gave it some nice texture as well.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back to Huszar again in the future.  It certainly wasn't the healthiest of meals but it was a tasty and is one of the few places in Pittsburgh to get authentic Hungarian food."}
{"text":"I was invited recently by a friend to go to Huszar, and on a Thursday night when the Gypsy Strings perform. I must say before I go further, that it is very important to make reservations on Thursdays night to have a seat, enjoy the performance, and food. The seating is very limited, as the place is very small. However, Iit is an absolutely fun time on Thursdays - I enjoyed listening to the Gypsy String and watching other customers join in singing.  Our waitress was wonderful and had gave excellent customer service. Now, the food! I had the Goulash and Hortobágyi Húsos Palacsinta. The Goulash is usually quite familiar to us in the US. It is similar to a beef stew that was filled with much flavor, comfort, and love....so I definitely recommend that. The Palacsinta was good as well, however the chicken is pureed in a crepe so I was a bit shocked with the texture but it was very delicious. And I loaded it up with a lot of sour cream. If you ask for extra Sour Cream, your waiter will LOVE YOU!"}
{"text":"Very authentic 100% homemade Hungarian, GREAT service and full bar. If that is what you are looking for then this is the place for you.  Decent portions and a nice amount of menu options. We ordered the Taste of Huszar which is an assortment of cheese, meat, bread, fruit and vegetables.  We also had Bakonyi Chicken with dumplings.  I have nothing bad to say about the food but honestly, it is nothing to write home about.  The desserts on the other hand are wonderful. My palate tends to like the more exotic and although this food was good, I found it bland and uneventful.  For me it was your standard, meat and stew sauce with a potato or dumplings.    They have a very small parking lot, maybe it fits 5 cars.  Street parking is a nightmare and is zoned, so here is a tip.  Right across the street from the restaurant is HOWARD street.  Park there on the right side.  Its a dead end and is not zoned.  You are welcome."}
{"text":"This is a great, authentic Hungarian restaurant. My meal of the Bakonyi Pork with Hungarian dumplings and white cabbage on the side was so delicious. Everything is made in house by their Hungarian trained chef. The owner sat down with us and explained to us about the dishes we were eating and about what they are doing as a restaurant to serve authentic cuisine. This place offers a great experience with fantastic food. Whether you're a pittsburgh native or a visitor looking to see what awesome restaurants pittsburgh has to offer, you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Great food, nice owners! Just ate here for the 4th time and it gets better each time. They are really perfecting the menu. I'd share photos, but I ate it all too fast. I've had several options on the menu and never been disappointed. The service keeps improving, too. Don't forget to try the Bulls Blood wine!"}
{"text":"My husband grew up eating Hungarian food made by his Grandmother who hailed from Budapest so it's cuisine I have also embraced. We search for Hungarian restaurants everywhere we go and now Pittsburgh has one right on the corner of East Street & North Avenue on the Northside. Hungarian food is delicious comfort food with slow cooked meats, flavorful sauces, homemade dumplings or noodles and scrumptious desserts. This restaurant also has a fairly large vegetarian menu and a full bar with some craft beer selections on tap.   I ordered the pickled red cabbage slaw and my husband got the cucumber salad to start. Both were fantastic. My entree was Chicken Paprikás which is stewed chicken in a paprika based cream sauce over dumplings. There were equal parts white & dark meat chicken in the dish, so I ate everything but the dark & my husband finished that along with his Beef Pörkölt in gravy over dumplings. Dessert was fresh from the oven Sour Cherry Strudel and a cottage cheese crepe Palacsinta as good as Grandma R. used to make!  We enjoyed chatting with Judy, the owner, and meeting her Hungarian chef who is here for 2 years on a work visa. Most importantly we really appreciated the food!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. We were eager to try and enjoy local places. I can't say one thing good about the place. The service was bad. Very slow and it wasn't even crowded. The food was horrible. Tasteless from the potatoes to the meats. Nothing had a taste. The meats were tough and dry with no taste. They looked as tho they were boiled not fried.we will never return to try again. We left everything only took one bite. Disgusting"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but I was disappointed.   The cucumber salads with sour cream was the best item I had. My Puszta Steak was surprisingly tasteless. It felt like a grease bomb. The Smashed potatoes were much better than the tasteless dumplings.   The ambiance is dingy bar. Unlikely to return.   The menu looks good but the taste is uneven."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our meal today celebrating Father's Day with my husband and son!  Started with the platter Taste of Huszar which we all shared--great assortment of cheeses, sausages, fruits and vegetables. A very good  balance of flavors and textures.  We all had different entrees-- Bakonyi Pork; Pork Chop stuffed with cheese and bacon and Chicken Paprikash. The portions were huge so we ended up taking home the delicious meals for lunch tomorrow.  This way we saved room for dessert and what a good move that was!  The fresh baked Hungarian desserts (which I can't spell!) were amazing! I highly recommend a visit for an awesome meal, and save room for dessert!  The hospitality was warm and welcoming.  A true gem in the Pittsburgh culinary scene!"}
{"text":"The food my husband got was pretty flavorless, but the potatoes that came with my meal must have gotten all the salt his meal was missing.  I was underwhelmed and disappointed.  I enjoyed the desserts though.   It's definitely a run-down bar atmosphere.  I suppose if you're craving hungarian food, this may be one of your only options in the city, but otherwise, I'd recommend eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The food was great, delicious and filling. The staff was so accommodating and knowledgeable of the menu! The desserts looked amazing! They also stayed open past close for us due to an Open table mix up! I would definitely come here again and again! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The pastry chef came to our table and recommended dessert and it was some of the best I've had.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly.  She suggested a beer for me, it was in a 500ml bottle.   We will be back and highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"First discovered this spot during the Deutschtown Music Festival last summer. Went back another time recently and had some food that was mind blowing. Hungarian food is some of my favorite so of course I was anxious to chow down. The fried cheese and cheese crepes are so good. I mean melt in your mouth good. Can't wait to get back for more."}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance on the outside fool you, living right by this place for a year now I always mistook it as a dive bar. Little did I know there was wonderful surprise waiting in there, delicious Hungarian food and incredible service. I had the bacon and cheese stuffed pork chop along with the potato pancake. The pork chop was savory and flavorful while the potato pancake was light and delicious. Paired with a Hungarian pilsner and affordable pricing for both food and drink, I'm looking forward to being a regular for dinner at this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Came across this place on OpenTable. Walked into a warm welcome, very comprehensive menu explaining all of the ethnic dishes. I chose the pork chops stuffed with bacon and cheese. My date chose the beef over dumplings. We received incredibly generous portions. It was suggested for me to try the Hungarian red wine. I absolutely loved it! They also carry Hungarian beer. Not very many traditional ethnic restaurants like this exist anymore ! We look forward to returning"}
