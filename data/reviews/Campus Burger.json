{"text":"First time trying this joint . The Baha burger was delicious .  The waffle cheese fries were awesome . I wanted to try the kettle chips but opted for the waffle fries instead ."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible!! I ordered the chicken sandwich and oh my goodness I should have taken a photo! First of all the sandwich buns were absolutely DRENCHED in butter and oil! My bun literally dripped oil! Second it wasn't even a chicken breast like all the other normal places you would order a chicken sandwich from. It was 3 sorry looking limp burned chicken tenders put on the sandwich!! Really? I couldn't even eat it because it was so greasy and the chicken tenders were dried out and when you would bite into them nothing would happen because they were so dried out that all the chicken stuck together!! Definitely skip this place."}
{"text":"I have NEVER in my entire life seen what I saw today at campus burger/chick shack in the champaign IL. Food court.   Today (as a tourist who has never been to this city) I went to the mall.  I shopped a bit and then my family and I got hungry so we looked in the food court and decided to try \"the burger place\" (as my son put it).  The girl at the counter (Chelsea I believe) was amazing and helped us and even built rappor by talking to us and asking how we were enjoying our trip. After we placed our order and the guy (miguel I believe) came out from the back to start cooking. We talked to the girl until our food was ready.  When we sat down I looked at my burger and realized it had the campus sauce on it and I only wanted mayo. Everything else was made just fine so I took my burger back  up and asked just simply for a replacement with JUST mayo.  She smile and said \"oh I'm so sorry mam its ok let me fix that for you\" she then turned around and told the guy behind the counter the issue and he rolled his eyes but started making it.  When I came back up for my food  she turned and looked at him to grab it, (and I'm not over exaggerating even a bit when I say this) he took the burger SLAMMED it in front of her even though he hands were out to take it and said rudely and loud \"If you would shut up and quit talking to people and pay attention then Maybe you would have gotten their order right!!!!\" she apologized to him and turned around and handed me my food and then put her head down.. I apologized to her and told her she didnt deserve to EVER be spoken to in such a way and she about broke Down and cried right then. As I walked away I hear him still speaking to her in this manner and degrading her by calling her names.  This is UNACCEPTABLE at ANY place of business, even in life in general.  Something needs done about this BC this poor girl is being verbally abused at work and it has broken my heart to witness such a thing.  I couldn't find a corporate number, so I don't know what else to do except post it.   Other than the the food wasnt horrible... Just very overly priced!"}
{"text":"Ho. Hum. I don't see what all the excitement is about.   As a first time visitor, I tried the bacon cheeseburger as part of the combo deal. The 'Almost Famous' waffle fries lived up to their billing but the burger itself was a letdown, resulting in the Ho Hum 3 star ranking.   In my opinion, any restaurant with 'burger' in it should deliver on that first. Just like a steakhouse should be know for their steak and not the salad bar or bread.   I guess I should have known I was in for a 'treat' when I saw the bacon for my order cooked in the deep fryer. The burger was cooked, but only adequately for health concerns. The condiments were applied haphazardly and the bun was just weird.   So, I would return at some point but I won't seek them out."}
{"text":"I normally don't eat at food courts but when you're hungry and you didn't have breakfast and you're forced to be at the location where you are typically don't have a choice and since I didn't want pizza or some other slob I tried this place the gentleman behind the counter Miggy Miguel whatever seems to be extremely mentally challenged or even worse is a foreigner who don't want to understand the English language but he's at least nice to the people as for the poor girl that works with him if she was my wife or daughter she wouldn't be spoken to the way he speaks to her extremely disrespectful crude rude certainly not the way you speak to a woman under any circumstances"}
{"text":"Very good, made while you wait burger. Nice counter help. Terrible kettle fries. Old, tough and chewy. Wasted my money on them."}
{"text":"Avoid the burger, chicken looked ok. Burger like a frozen pre-made patty. Not hot and bacon looks like food poisoning in a pink dress. One star for the fries being ok."}
