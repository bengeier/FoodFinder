{"text":"A lovely, friendly spot in a great neighborhood. Stopped in for a light bite while walking around with my husband and son. Great service, wide variety on the menu and a welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best place for the money around. My friends and I enjoyed large portioned breakfasts and cheap, good beer many days/nights here. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Sandwich cajun, très bon mais le poulet est sec.
Mouche à fruit dans mon café, ordinaire.
Le service est excellent."}
{"text":"Un petit café resto très correct! Je vous conseille la cour intérieure en été, vraiment sympa! Nous avons très bien mange avec ma femme, salade César et croque monsieur très bon et d'un bon rapport qualité prix! Le service y est aussi très bon. A recommander les yeux fermes!"}
{"text":"During three days in Montreal, I visited this café 7 times.  Yes, 7.  Because I have children, and this is the only place they would eat.  They loved it.  Granted, part of the reason they love it is that it has three stories, and going up and down stairs while inside a café seems to have a certain appeal.  The top floor seemed \"secret\" and mysterious and had beanbaggy chairs (lots of windows up there, so not \"secret\" in a creepy way).
The croissants were fabulous.  The coffee was, too.  One kid had decaf lattes which were amazing and served in very large bowls.  Actually beautiful.  The other had hot cocoa, also served with fresh steamed milk, not made with hot water & a mix.  Really, really good.
It seemed expensive, but the US dollar was weak during our visit, so I can't say much about that.
The staff, young & chic though they were, were equally tolerant of my young children, my middle-aged self (sigh) and my bad French.  Also they secretly are all fluent in English, if you're in a pinch...
Found it thanks to a tip from a Montreal native, and I'm so glad I did!"}
{"text":"The lady was a little rude to me when I was smelling/looking at the teas. They have  great products though.Nice place to sit."}
{"text":"L'endroit idéal pour un rendez-vous d'affaire ou pour étudier... le tout autour d'un bon café!"}
{"text":"Coffee is old and burnt - cookies are so hard you will break your teeth on it and the staff cant smile or greet you properly. 
In a city with so many amazing independant coffee shop, this one is a shame."}
{"text":"Such a great spot for a coffee along St. Denis! I had a coffee outside on the patio, which was a lovely spot to people-watch and enjoy a sunny summer afternoon. Inside there are lots of coffee bean options to bring home and brew yourself. Great atmosphere and high quality coffee."}
{"text":"When I'm trying a new coffee shop, I'm usually looking about three things. The first one, and the one that makes more sense, is the coffee! The coffee was great, so nothing to say on this.

The second thing is, like everywhere else, is the service. I liked this venue as you sit down, and they'll serve you at your table. The service was good, and fast.

Last but not least, I'm looking for a computer friendly coffee shop. I won't stop going to a place that is doing a great coffee, if this is not a computer friendly venue, but I may go less often. This one has a lot of seats, and table, but they are lacking of electric outlets. It's a problem if you plan to stay there to get work done. Also, the free wifi was so slow, even with only 3 people connected. I had problem to load simple web pages... By chance I had my Internet USB stick.

At the end, it's a good coffee shop, but maybe not the best one if you need Internet (who don't need Internet for their devices today!?), and have a short-life battery for your laptop."}
{"text":"Coffees, teas, bakery based menu.  Best bagel I ever tasted, and the egg-ham-cheese on it was superb.  Delicious coffee, out of dozens of varieties.  Endless tea choices as well.  Pleasant service and reasonable prices.  What's to not like?"}
{"text":"Cute cafe on Rue St Denis in the Plateau area of Montreal.  The gentleman who served us was very knowledgeable about coffee, beans, brewing etc, and even though they were closing up for the day he took time to chat. The first question  was what type of machine we had and then what type of roast we liked.  He gave a couple of suggestions and we bought a bag of their Francaise Noir blend and Imperial blend.  

We returned the next day after visiting the Jardine Botanique. We ordered americanos which were smooth but not as robust or dark as we usually liked.  The atmosphere was very casual and relaxed, people working on their laptops, others on the patio catching up with friends.  Great place to hang out on a sunny afternoon."}
{"text":"Cet endroit a définitivement connu des jours meilleurs et les années dorées de la brûlererie je les ai bien connues!

Aujourd'hui c'est délabré, sale, la peinture sur les murs est fatiguée.. et il n'y a plus d'ambience (selon moi elle est partie en même temps que les serveurs et le service aux tables!)

On évite en raison des prix, du service (et de la très mais très bête jeune femme au comptoir à café) et le manque d'ambiance... ah... est-ce que j'ai dit que c'était sale et délabré?  Oubliez des prises éléctriques pour votre laptop... dans les années 90's c'était déjà beau d'avoir une pagette... alors imaginez un laptop! ;-)

Sur St-Denis c'est pas le choix qui manque alors on oublie la Brûlerie!"}
{"text":"Great coffee menu-tons of options!
Lunch menu is typical but decent. 
Service was slow because they only had one waitress on the patio (minimum 10 tables). She was absolutely lovely and going as quickly as she could, but solely due to the shortness of staff, we waited quite a long time for our menu and order to be taken, and there was obviously no quality check done. 
Assumed their was adequate staffing, I would definitely visit again for one of their delectable coffee concoctions."}
{"text":"Love the coffee, love the service. Also have nice tables, free wifi, and outlets, so it's a great place to do some work when it's not busy!"}
{"text":"We had a great afternoon meal here after a nice walk down the creative street on which it is placed. Individual french press pots of your choice of over 30 types of coffee, sandwiches, salads, and soup"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this cafe after walking for hours on Saturday night and needing to rest our tired feet. This cafe has nice high ceilings and a big exposed brick wall. Nice ambiance, with a big menu to go with it. I opted for a decaf coffee with whipped cream, and they did not skimp on the whipped cream. My bf and I shared the carrot cake and we couldn't even finish it since it was so big. 

The breakfast menu looks tasty and affordable, I'd love to come back and enjoy breakfast on their patio once spring officially hits.

All in all we liked the cafe, very reasonable prices, a large variety of espresso based drinks (took us a few minutes to make up our minds!) and service is pretty quick although we never did get that second fork we asked for..."}
{"text":"Inexplicably overrated coffee only marginally preferable to the Second Cup et. all chains. Sandwiches are overpriced and mediocre (and they come with an inedible  \"side salad\" comprised of shredded carrots doused in some kind of ranch-esque sauce). Like the rest of their mini-chain brethren, it's also too brightly lit, uncomfortable (bad arrangement of table space leads to feeling of being more cramped than necessary) with generally poor service (of the slow to non-existent variety). Best thing to order coffee-wise is their cafe au laits which come in French-style bowls."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a cappuccino on this picturesque street. Listening to locals speaking French and watching people as they walk by, this was a pleasant stop. There was a large selection of whole bean coffee which excited me (I grind my coffee at home). There were other treats available.

Our server amused me in my meager attempts at ordering in French. I was appreciative of his patience, nay willingness, to allow me to do so. Staff are bilingual and found to be very pleasant with us tourist. It also seems to be a stop for the locals as well."}
{"text":"La Brûlerie définitivement sympa pour y aller entre amis et papoter pas trop longtemps... C'est donc avec une amie que je m'y rends, un lundi après-midi.

 La cappuccino était vraiment divin, beaucoup beaucoup de mousse de lait, bien épaisse et onctueuse. 

En revanche côté ambiance et niveau sonore, je suis un peu moins emballée... Il n'y ni style, ni âme dans cette brûlerie. Je m'attendais à quelque chose de plus traditionnel, des canapés ou fauteuils club et des banquettes pour une ambiances cosy. 
Eh non, les tables sont blanches, les chaises inspiration Ikea, quelques tables près de l'entrée et donc du froid ont elles de gros fauteuils... Aussi, impossible de trouver une prise électrique pour brancher votre laptop ou mobile. Dommage sachant qu'ils sont dans le quartier de l'UQAM ! 

Le niveau sonore est assez élevé est écourte plutôt la pause café... 

L'endroit mériterait un effort côté look mais côté café bravo !"}
{"text":"Cette brûlerie St-Denis, qui a pignon sur la rue qui lui a donné son nom, est l'originale. Aussi, il s'agit d'une véritable institution à Montréal et elle mérite sa réputation. Sa carte des cafés offre un fabuleux choix de grains issus des quatre coins de la planète. Aussi, comme l'établissement est à la fois importateur et torréfacteur, on y trouve des cafés frais et leurs employés, bien entendu, savent manier la machine à espresso. Si vous n'êtes pas un grand amateur de café, rassurez-vous ; la variété de thés offerts à la Brûlerie St-Denis lui permettrait de prendre le nom de «Maison du thé St-Denis» advenant une pénurie mondiale de café. Le service y est toujours courtois, quoiqu'un peu lent, surtout en heure de pointe. On peut aussi manger sur place et commander une salade ou un sandwich. La nourriture servies est aussi simple que bonne, mais est à mon avis trop chère pour ce qu'elle vaut vraiment. Du reste, c'est pour le café qu'on fréquente la Brûlerie..."}
{"text":"I had butter/jam croissant, le captaine sandwich (smoked salmon sandwich served with Caesar salad). a bit pricey but the taste is good."}
{"text":"I went here and Brûlerie St-Denis has been replaced by a Hunan restaurant. Was pretty upset after walking from the Marriot-Courtyard Hotel on Levesque. Why is this still on Yelp?"}
{"text":"Great food and better service! Everyone working greeted me when I came in and my server checked on me a few times to see how everything was. I had the Triangle du more sandwich which was pretty good, but the Thai soup was AWESOME. Overall very satisfied though it was a little pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"excellent café, endroit sympa et conviviale ,"}
{"text":"Another day and another stop would lead us to Brulerie St. Denis where I found not only great service and Free Wi-Fi but also two great roasts, the first a fruity and aromatic Ethiopie Yirrgacheffe that I tasted as drip in store and subsequently purchased for French Press brewing at home -  a substantial step up that highlighted the coffee's rich mouthfeel and assertive caramel notes that came through on the finish.

Moving next to something I'd not seen stateside in quite some time, my second pick from Brulerie was 60 grams of Jamaique Blue Mountain in a vapor sealed bag for $10.  Certainly the most pricey coffee I've ever purchased in whole bean form and saved for home, first via Chemex and then via French Press I will admit that the flavor was sublime - a truly complete roast with surprising sweetness, low acidity, and aromatics that bordered of floral when made via pour over and allowed to bloom a bit but even better when pressed - a nearly creamy taste on the palate that I'd place in the top two or three cups of coffee I've ever brewed at home (though perhaps not the best despite being the most expensive.)  Certainly not an everyday indulgence I do think every coffee fan with the means should definitely try a cup at least once even if only to know the standard by which others can and should be judged."}
{"text":"Caught in the rain!! We stumbled in here and had a coffee and a lemon tart.  Yum!!  Service was great and we were del get a table.  Didn't eat but the food looked good."}
{"text":"This is the original BRÛLERIE ST.DENIS. They have good coffees, real good coffees. The food was not bad, just a tad overpriced, if you ask me. The sandwich I ordered was like $12,95+tx. Was it worth it?!?! Ah, no!

The wi-fi works really well, though."}
{"text":"I've been familiar with many Brulerie StDenis establishments over the last decade. The days where maman used to take me there for a warm meal are long gone. I have reached my limit after a horrible experience there this afternoon. Just imagine a wet slab of bread drenched in tomato juice and a mustard-mayo mix, flanked with the withering leaves of a soggy Ceasar salad. Also, my friend's meal simply never came! But it's probably better this way, since the food at Brulerie st Denis is overpriced, stale and massively uninspired. I came with the expectation of Proustian reminiscence and I left with a doggy bag full of disappointment. Coffee is great though!"}
{"text":"a really lovely café located in a great spot in the plateau! the wait staff is very professional and personable! the most impressive thing is their huuuuuge selection of coffees from all over the world! the wall menu is also very aesthetically pleasing with the labelled coffee beans directly below! great place to relax with some friends!"}
{"text":"Excellent endroit pour prendre un café au soleil, en plein coeur du Plateau!
Leur terrasse est grande, facilitant les chances d'obtenir une place à l'extérieur, mais les tables sont tassées, facilitant l'écoute des conversations entre les tables. 
Je n'ai rien trouvé d'extraordinaire dans leurs breuvages, mais rien qui m'empêche d'y aller non plus. C'est un endroit sympa où aller lorsque notre endroit préféré est bondé.
Il y a une place à l'amélioration côté ambiance/déco, surtout pour la terrasse!"}
