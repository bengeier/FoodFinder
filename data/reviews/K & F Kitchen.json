{"text":"K & F Kitchen is a small little store located in First Markham Place.   Walking in, I smelt a huge stench of stinky tofu, but it seemed to disappear as time past. We didn't think that a lot of people would come in here because the store didn't seem extremely nicely decorated, but we were surprised when people were waiting for seats by 6:45pm on a Sunday. English menus are also available!  We ordered the Set A dinner for $26.99 which included a Free-Range Chicken with Soya and Wine, Sweet and Sour Pork, Beef with Mushrooms and Green Onions and the Chinese Greens with Minced Garlic. Since they were sold out of the Free-Range Chicken with Soya and Wine, we were allowed to select any item we wanted from the menu that was $8.99, so we decided to get the chicken steam with lotus leaf. Each bowl of white rice costs $1.80, but the quality of the rice was good and the size of it was rather large.  Although the dishes were rather small, the dishes were really hot and I thought it was extremely delicious. Nice and hot dishes makes the dishes taste extra delicious. The Sweet and Sour Pork had huge pieces of pork in it, the beef with mushroom was slightly salty but eating it with white rice is perfect. The greens were of good quality and the garlic clearly made them smell really good.  This set meal didn't come with soup, but it came with the most delicious dessert of them all - ??? (Soft tofu with syrup)."}
{"text":"The place is small but there is no wait time even for a Saturday night dinner.  Service was not great, the waitresses barely talked to us.  First, it was an inconvenience for her to inform us they were out of a certain dish.  Second, when another lady delivered our steamed veggie pot, she was stirring it madly as if trying to find something, then went back to the kitchen without saying a word.  She came back eventually with which I assumed was the same pot with the other hand scratching her face on top of our pot.   After we paid and asked if the dessert will be coming, the lady said: \"You are too early.\"  Food quality is decent in small portions.    Probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Decided to hit up a quick dinner w/ Mom.  To be honest, we have tried everything at FMP and I still like and rather the food court! They are actually good chefs at the food court, they just open they own so they can be there own boss :)  Ok back to this place ... The prices are awesome for FMP. But, the food unmm not so good. Not much selections and from the folks sitting very near us (tables are very closed together) you can tell it's usual crowd, not many 1st timers.  If you go with a 2 persons table, it's very small. We ordered 3 dishes + a soup and we ended up having to hold our rice / soup bowls throughout :(  The dishes are very simple. Don't be expecting extra variation of veggies in your stew. The 5 spices duck was ok when it comes to the marination, but the duck was very skinny, not much meat.  The only good thing is the soup. It was very well cooked. You can taste it with every drop.  Highlight of the visit: the soup and dirty floors  Food (Taste): 2/5 Food (Presentation): 1/5 Kitchen (Delivery Speed): 3/5 Service: 1/5 - avg with a bit of an attitude Ambiance: 0/5 - floors were dirty :( eww Fun Factor: 0/5 not fun when you can hear the entire convo one table over"}
