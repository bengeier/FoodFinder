{"text":"I get super excited over meat - Grilled meats, BBQ meats, Red meats, white meats, gamey meats - you get the idea. I'm nothing close to a vegetarian. I also love to try new restaurants - so when this new burger joint opened up in Liberty Village it was excitement, rinse and repeat.   First off, I have to say that decor and design was really nice. Black leather benches with nail-head studded black leather chairs coupled with gun-metal grey brick veneer walls and white-pine floors gives the resto a nice, no-fuss-no-muss appeal.  The chalkboard menu offers a number of options - some adventurous burgers and some old faithfuls. I appreciate the sense of adventure and originality to make a burger more than just an ordinary burger. i.e. the Masala Burger and the Montreal Smoked Meat Burger.    All things pointed to a positive experience.   You never want to gauge a burger joint on how the most extravagant burger tastes, but rather the most basic burger - it just allows the ingredients to shine.  In this case, I ordered the Bacon and Cheddar burger with curry poutine.  My friend ordered the Mtl smoked Meat burger.   Our names were called and we grabbed our paper bags filled with our food.  Remember that no-fuss-no-muss appeal - well, they took it too far.  Our meals cost $16 for my friend and $18 for me (They had boylans soda - couldn't resist) For that money, give me a plate to eat off of.   I unwrapped my burger from the wax paper and the bottom ciabatta was soaked with grease and the slightest press of the bun created a mayo-ooze from a soaked-through part of the middle of the bun. I'm ok with ooze out of the side, but not the middle of the bun. I had to wrap the burger in a napkin to stave off any grease fingers.   The chuck itself lacked seasoning and flavour.  Very little salt, which some might like, but for me, I need a seasoned patty.  not talking dead sea or Bolivian salt flats but, you know, a couple grains of salt would be nice.   Even the bacon (which is usually indistinguishable from magic - I mean they use bacon on OK food to make it great. ) was a hearty *Meh*  Didn't finish the curry poutine as the curry gravy wasn't great.  Which can also be confirmed by my friend who had a side of gravy for his fries actually used the words 'I hate this gravy'.    What was most shocking is that it's owned by the same people that have done a fabulous job with Liberty Noodle.  It's safe to say that they are in a sophomore slump with Chuck and Co.   Overall, not a positive experience lacking in flavour, dinnerware and clean hands.  For the price, I'd rather go to Mildred's temple kitchen and get proper sit-down service and a GREAT burger.   I'm sure they'll get their act together at some point, but I won't give them a second chance anytime soon. (maybe for the boylan's soda)"}
{"text":"thought of trying that place and it looked cool from the outside.  in short, wasn't too impressed.  the burger was good and the fries as well. service was nice, however the atmosphere was not right and it was too pricy.  the place looked really dirty and unfinished. paid for 2 burgers with sides and 2 cokes $40.....  it has potential (look, menu), but it seems it is not being runned well"}
{"text":"Chuck and Co is a relatively new burger joint in Liberty Village. They are a nice change from the standard fast food places that serve burgers in the area.  They have several different burger offerings and a wide range of sides from fries to what they call cheeseburger dumplings.  While I was there I ordered their Bacon Cheddar Burger with a side of fries with curry gravy.,  Overall the burger was delicious, home made, very flavourful, very tender and juicy. At first I though I was given the wrong order as I couldn't find the bacon but realised that they add the bacon as part of the burger patty instead of placed on top like most places do.   The side of fries was good. My only disappointment was in the curry gravy. It had some flavour but I expected more kick especially for it's name.  As for the place itself they still seem to be setting things up. The seating was comfortable with leather seats and bar style stools. There was also power plugs located under the bar style seating for those with laptops. There may have been wireless Internet but I didn't ask if it was available for customer use.  Positives - Home made burgers - Tender and very flavourful - Wide range of sides - Comfortable leather seating - Some outside seating available - Power outlets for laptops etc  Negatives - Curry Gravy needs more kick"}
{"text":"Went there once and left without ordering anything. I am usually never a complainer but the place just looked dirty from the inside (and I am not even talking grungy) and there was a mosquito hovering around the table. I will give it a shot again if they atleast clean up the place and make it smell decent"}
{"text":"Went there today for the 1st time ever. Got there at 1pm. Line was about 8 deep. What I didn't know was that there were about 4 people ahead of those people waiting for their orders to come up, so I was really 13th in line to get my food.   First impressions, place is really clean and has a stocked condiment stand with all the fixings. A/C throughout, and 90's adult contemporary music playing.  There was only one person taking orders which is fine, because she is fast and accurate. But the wait for the food to come out of the kitchen was pretty long. I waited in line 7 minutes until I got to the front, placed my order and then waited another 17 minutes for my Chuck Burger, Fries and drink to come up.  It's freshly made so the wait was not too bad, but I would prefer 10-12 minute waits Vs 17. Still, tasty burger but I noticed there were few toppings on my burger. I guess when you order, you have to ask for pickles, etc otherwise it just comes with what the burger normally comes with.  The fries were NY style with the skin on, and I just wish they were little crunchier. They came with a chipotle dip which was a nice touch.  Overall, a good experience and I will be back.   But the wait times have to be cut down and next time I will ask for pickles on my burger. Girl taking the order was friendly and polite."}
{"text":"Experience similar to Trish Q's. Went for brunch and first thought was  \"Why is this floor so sticky?\"  There was maybe one or two other tables in there - the space is new, nice, and professionally designed. Lots of black and wood and hanging light-bulbs.  The prices looked reasonable (~10$ or so) and food was OK.  My hard-fried egg was greasy and hardly fried. Sort of YUCKY.  The banana pancakes were quite good. They were served with peanut butter and jam on the side - I'm not sure why.  Thick cut bacon was an excellent side. VERY good bacon. Almost like beef jerky.  Fries were tiny shoe-string, tepid, and dry. Not great.  The electronic payment machine was down, but they told us at the end of the meal so I had to walk to a convenience store and get charged 3$ to take out cash. Didn't like that so much.  Service was a little weak, also.  I would go back for a burger and beer- if they wash that floor."}
{"text":"A fantastic brunch, unless you're hungover.  The husband and I were looking for a brunch spot at the ungodly early hour of 12 noon on a Sunday. Chuck & Co. looked like a nice spot. Also, they had a huge sign out front that said BRUNCH.   Inside is airy and modern. There is a big bar-height table in the middle, and several 2-seaters at the sides. There's an open kitchen at the back and one of the friendliest servers I've ever met running around.   Luckily, we weren't hungover (thus being awake at 12 noon) because it was also full of 30-ish couples and their screaming children. Normally, this isn't a huge deal, since they weren't really making THAT much of a racket, but the place had high ceiling and tiled walls, creating some kind of screaming baby nightmare cave.  The brunch was very good. The fresh squeezed OJ was indeed freshly squeezed and just amazing, though pricey at $5 a glass (anyone who's ever worked a brunch shift at a restaurant and had to squeeze the OJ will consider this is more than fair). I had the classic breakfast: 2 eggs, 2 pieces of toast, a big honking slice of bacon (more on that later) and frites for $9. Considering the area, this wasn't bad. The eggs were perfectly runny and the bacon was just.. almost indescribably incredible. After gushing about it, our server told us that they buy it in a huge slab, then cut it nice and thick (at least 1/4\" at my estimation). It was perfectly flavoured and fatty, and cooked soft, which is how i requested it. It made my morning. The frites were thin crispy, but a little cold, probably because there was only one cook on staff and the place was pretty busy. They definitely had potential and I'd like to try them again just to make sure. Husband was reasonably happy with his breakfast crepe.  Both of us were really happy with the meal and the service, and will probably return again to check out their burgers. We might pop our heads inside first, though, and assess the kids situation."}
{"text":"Well, Chuck on St. Clair has gone under - it sported a \"closed for renovation\" sign for a week or so, but that's been replaced by a couple of inexpertly-lettered \"for lease\" signs.  I'm afraid the writing was on the wall from the day it opened.   1)  There is some stiff damn competition in this neighbourhood.  If you're looking for a place where two people can get a delicious, unpretentious meal for under $50, you've got Churrasco of St. Clair, Stockyards, Mezzetta, and Vannis - and that's all within 50 meters of the corner of St. Clair & Christie.  If you're willing to go another block or two, you've got great Mexican and good Indian, too.    2)  You're selling burgers across the street from Stockyards.  Yes, Chuck had better seating and a liquor license, but the food wasn't as good and there wasn't much of a price difference.    3)  The ambiance was all wrong for this neighbourhood.  Did I call it \"nouveau abbatoir\" in my earlier review?  I should have.  If I'm looking for a haven after a long day at work, I don't want  bare bulbs and an interior that looks like it was designed for easy hosing off.  It's a shame - the staff were always really nice, and the burgers weren't bad.  I hate to see a place go under in my area, but the mix was just wrong.  I dropped by for takeout poutine on election night; the place was dead silent, and I was a bit uncomfortable as I waited for my junk food.  The stench of death was on the place already.  I got home, and the portion was huge and piping hot - but the gravy was bland, and I pitched a good chunk of it out.  Better luck next time, Chuck owners."}
{"text":"Meant to go to Smokehouse on St. Clair, but the place was jam packed so ventured across the street to Chuck and Co instead.  Looked like a nice place, but oddly, completely empty.  That's always a worry, but we went anyway.  Apparently, they won a prize for best burger in Toronto Life, so must be okay.  Noticed that they fry burgers on a griddle instead of char broiling though.  Odd for a real burger place.  Isn't frying a burger a bit like boiling toast?  So we ordered.  I had the award winning Montreal Burger which featured smoked meat.  We also had a Juicy Lucy which has mozzarella inside it and a portobello mushroom burger.  We ordered some fries which arrived first, like a  starter, which was odd.  They were good, but fries are meant to go with a burger.  That's basic burger stuff to me.  The burgers arrived after we finished the fries completely.  The portobello burger had two small and limp mushrooms rather than a nice big one, so that was disappointing.  They were pretty greasy too.  My Montreal burger was okay, but as it was fried, not a great flavour to me.  The buns were kind of heavy, so I didn't like them too much either.  The Juicy Lucy was missing the cheese completely, so back it went.  It arrived a bit later and it had the cheese but also a kind of funny smell and taste.  It seemed to us like the meat might be too old.  I didn't like it at all and the others didn't have this taste or smell, so that was worrying.  So, I guess I know why it was completely empty when we arrived and when we left.  Service was charming and friendly, but that's kind of small potatoes.  These were not good burgers."}
{"text":"I'm new to the Liberty Village area and was really excited to check out the new lunch spots. Chuck made such a horrible impression that it will take me a while (and a lot of convincing) to get me back through those doors.   The line up was reasonable when we entered (maybe 10 people), but the staff seemed really stressed and confused. And in an unproductive way. There were so many people trying to do one thing that all the other things were collapsing around them. The line got out of control, they were mixing up orders.   We ended up waiting for 1 hour for burgers and poutine. I ended up having to leave for a meeting and have a coworker bring my food back for me, so after leaving it for work, it was cold by the time I ate. Definitely not worth the trouble.  And just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, my vegetarian coworker discovered what he thought was mushrooms on his poutine was really veal.   Not cool, Chuck."}
{"text":"I really wish I had liked this place as it is in my hood, but wow was it ever disappointing. First the bun. Huge, doughy and overwhelming. Then the burger - bland and too small for the bun. Then the toppings. Slathered with so much mustard you couldn't taste anything else. I had the bacon cheeseburger (so much bun you couldn't taste the bacon, cheese or burger). I followed that up with the Montreal burger which supposedly had smoked meat which you couldn't taste because of the bun and the mustard. Will never return as there so many good burger joints in this town (Gourmet Burger Co. The Burger Shack, Five Guys, etc.). Was very surprised that NOW magazine gave it a decent review in their 50 Best Burgers feature recently."}
{"text":"Burgers are good. Fries are great.  Try the bacon and cheese it is really delicious.  This place just needs a good manager and some atmosphere.  Floor is sticky. Music is hard to hear, they need a sound system. Take the stickers off the windows and door.  I think this place will close because it is never busy.  I am hoping they get the energy up and draw a bigger crowd, because the food is a great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"tried the St. Clair location. Okay, service was nice but the food: way over priced. We had the slider plate with three different burgers. Meh. I mean, for this kind of money the burgers should blow me away and they were mediocre. The Mac and Cheese was terrible though. Very floury. I could taste the roux my 2 year old wouldn't even eat it. Let me repeat that: MY TWO YEAR OLD wouldn't eat the mac'n cheese. As a matter of fact she asked to go home after taking a few bites of everything. Very disappointing. Do yourself a favour, stay home buy some fresh ground chuck from your butcher and make yourself a great burger. It's easy and a much better experience. Too bad I hoped for better."}
{"text":"After being yelled at by a server at The Stockyards for asking how long the wait would be, we went across the street to a little, unassuming burger shoppe Chuck and Co. Though it looked like a auto garage on the inside, the service was prompt and friendly and the brunch menu was big AND included their trademark burgers.   The wait for the food was reasonable and, even though, strangely, my burger did not come with fries, it was a tasty hunk of ground chuck meat on an amazing caibatta bun.  A nice burger joint with big, thick cut pieces of bacon everyone can enjoy!"}
{"text":"Overpriced.  Juicy Lucy was anything but that. It was dry and bland.  Chuck is a little overrated.  Merci Mon Ami half a block from Chuck has a better burger hands down.  Spoke to some of my friends and they all agree the quality has significantly gone down since Chuck opened."}
{"text":"Went out with the roommate (A), best friend (Cat), and roommate's sister (E) to go to Cafe Cinquecento.  Alas, they were prepping for dinner service, and now we were starving and tired due to missing breakfast and lunch on a house cleaning spree.   Walking towards Atlantic Ave, we were torn between a couple of asian places and Chuck & Co. I was not thrilled, being a huge asian foodie, but decided to go along with the group.   From the outside, the place seems okay. Nothing too thrilling.  Upon entering, a large ritzy looking menu, a small hip looking young woman behind the counter, and a guy in the corner eating a burger.   We took FOREVER to order. Grace (the hip young woman) was very accommodating,  even answering our questions about the range of drinks in the fridge.   Finally deciding, everyone ordered:  A - Vegetarian Burger with veggie poutine (the gravy is mushroom based) and a Boylan Root beer Cat - Vegetarian Burger with sweet potato fries, and a Nestea E - Masala Burger with veggie poutine I decided to go for the Lamb burger with traditional poutine and a Boylan Black Cherry soda.   Sitting and waiting for the food, I noticed the decor. It was simple, yet elegant. Bottles of condiments were brought to our table. The music selection was IMPECCABLE! No rap, horrible top 40's, or electric fiddles playing. I heard The Who, The Guess Who, Rolling Stones, Blood, Sweat, and Tears...I think I almost cried when I found myself really enjoying song after song. This has never happened anywhere other than when I listen to my iPod. At this time, the tummy is rumbling and yelling at me. GET ME SOME FOOD, YOU IDIOT!   ...so after talking my tummy out of committing suicide during the wait, the food finally made it's way to the table in grease-proof containers with the burger and fries sectioned off perfectly.   I WAS SHOCKED when I opened my container.   REAL CHEESE CURDS! I am French Canadian, and I have had some amazing poutine...and some not. I have not been able to find good fries, gravy, and REAL CURDS in the GTA that were worth saying anything to! Smokes look out! You may have the toppings, but you have nothing on this place!  The burger (unlike many places that I have been to) was not overdone. It was perfect, the mint mayo was refreshing (just as Grace had said), the tomato was ripe, and the lettuce was crisp. The ciabatta bun was a great addition.  A's burger was good. She sensed some indian spices in her burger. The mushroom gravy was a good veggie option. Cat was a little weirded out that her 'burger' seemed to split and fan out from the bun when she took a bite. The sweet potato fries came with a chipotle sauce and were quite yummy. E said that she expected her burger to be spicier, and brought the hot sauce over to the table.   Throughout the meal, Grace kept coming to our table and offered us water that was cold from her handy-dandy water bottle. It was essentially a refillable wine bottle, and gave this place the air of class.   I do believe that, besides the company I was with, that Grace really made the visit. I even got a tip on foursquare that Grace was amazing and she made someone else's day. THIS WOMAN DESERVES A RAISE! If she would not have been so attentive, not even a great playlist would have made me come back.    I have never EVER gone back to a burger bar, but I do have to go often. Meat is one of the things that the husfriend isn't allergic to...so burgers are a main food group for him. It's just down the street even. ...it's also right next to my gym. -_-;;;   They told us that we can call ahead, Grace loaded us up with menus and cards. I WILL BE RETURNING! It is now a go to spot...if only they served beer..."}
{"text":"I really love hamburgers, so I was very excited to try out this burger place that my friend recommended. I was not disappointed! I had the chuck burger with cheese and it was wonderful. It wasn't dry or overcooked, it had a nice flavour. It was a GREAT size...some burgers are mammoth but this was just right. I got the 50/50 fries, sweet potato and fresh cut. They were GREAT. A really good amount, crispy just the way I love them, and the one thing I appreciated was that they didn't charge you extra if you wanted the sweet potato fries like just about every other place will.  One complaint was that the table was pretty tiny and there was no tray or plate to eat on, so the greasy burger wrapper was then put onto the bare table...when I was finished I had greasy hands and a greasy table to contend with -- but that's what napkins are for, I guess! It's a little pricier than other places, yes, but it wasn't so much so that it is a deterrent for me coming back. The service was very friendly and attentive. I will definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"I recently had a chance to actually try this place and I am happy to announce they are worth all the hype. First off they are now open on Saturdays and have hours printed on their window finally (that they actually seem to follow)... so far so good.  The prices are a bit steep but I assure you the burgers are delicious! I ordered the Bacon Cheddar Burger for 8.00 (that's just the burger with no sides!) It was amazing which I attribute to the incredible beef they use and the bun which is more of a ciabatta.  I am still curious about this curry poutine business but that will have to wait for a day when I have more cash :-)"}
{"text":"Y'all know when you're the club and this fly-looking honey comes up to you, and you're like, \"damn girl,\" because she's beautiful and by some miraculous alignment of the stars, she sticks around long enough for you to sidle up to her and then she starts talking and you're like \"oh, this really isn't the flavourful burger I was expecting at all. And it took kind of a long time to come out.\" That's Chuck and Co.  The spot is definitely easy on the eyes with a mod monochrome look. There is a patio out front, and a fair bit of seating inside. They had a stack of newspapers and I had no where to be, so I decided to get my order for here i.e., there.  I kept it simple with the chuck burger ($6). It took foreeeeever. By the time I got it I was starving and smashed the burger with my face. It tasted a little overdone (but still moist), and they had forgotten the lettuce. I was already a few bites in so I didn't bother mentioning this to them, but it was a bit disappointing that they screwed up their most basic burger.  Not a destination for me, but I would probably return.  Obligatory Title Pun: I just don't give a CHUCK.  Menu Readability: Highly readable sign above the counter.  Need to mention: Boylan's soda is available here.  What this place teaches me about myself: That I really don't know what happens inside nightclubs."}
{"text":"For our burger fix, the girlfriend and I decided to head out west to check out a placed called, Chuck & Co. If you have never been, it's located around the newly revamped area, Liberty Village. It's a little outta town, but trust me it's worth the commute. Warning yelpers, it's a long entry.  We went for a late dinner and my advice to anyone heading there a little before closing time, you can always place your orders for pick up. We placed our orders 30 minutes before closing and told them we would be there in about 15 or so minutes. We got there a little later but the food was fresh and ready for us. Instead of simply picking up our order, we asked if it's okay if we just ate here quickly. We felt kinda bad as they were closing in 10 mins, but the staff was very and I repeat again, very friendly. They said, don't rush and enjoy the food. So a very good first impression of the restaurant so far.  We ordered a ton of food so here's a list of what we got. My gf got the Bacon Cheddar Burger with fries and an ice tea. I got the Breakfast Burger and the Bacon Cheddar Burger with onion rings and a Black Cherry Boylan Soda. We also ordered a new drink called, New Leaf. It's a honeydew melon white tea sweetened with pure cane suger (sorry, no review here as we didn't end up drinking it). We got our food and proceeded to sit down. I looked at my gf and she seems to like the decor as well. It seems to show a little more character than W Burger Bar as it's a little more rustic, but in a modern way. There's a strong contrast with the decor inside and it worked.  Our first couple of bites into the Bacon Cheddar Burger... AMAZING! We were trying to hold ourselves back as we knew what happened at W Burger Bar. So we decided to try out the onion rings and fries... and the onion rings, AMAZING as well. We were a little blown away. The fries on the other hand, good but nothing special. Went back to the burger and it was just as good, no joke. And I have to say, I think the onion rings are probably one of the best onion rings I have ever had. All the sides were made from scratch and the patty of course. We can taste the freshness of it and I liked the seasoning. I'm curious how this burger would taste with a regular sesame bun than their toasted ciabatta bun. Now the Breakfast burger was good, but not as good as the Bacon Cheddar Burger. How were the drinks you might ask? Well the drinks we good, but I liked the Johnnie Ryan Coke better from Burger Bar. Weird I know, but I'm definitely willing to give the Boylan drink a second chance the next time I'm back at Chuck & Co.  Overall, I definitely liked Chuck & Co. Not only were the staff very friendly, I mean they were closing the tills, counting money, etc while we were eating. We didn't end up leaving till about 10 minutes or so after their closing time and they were STILL very nice. They even asked how was the food and everything with a smile, told us to have a goodnight as we left. So customer service was excellent. And the burger? A little messy but I liked the Bacon Cheddar Burger quite a bit and this will be the highest burger rating to date. I know my gf enjoyed it, maybe not as much as me... but definitely in her top list as well. The onion rings? One of the best as well, forget the fries Go for the ONION RINGS! So I recommend Chuck & Co. I'm waiting for a second trip back to see if maybe we just had a fluke good night, or maybe this something we can always expect. If I were to go back and it's the same results, trust me... this might be one of the better burger places period, I'm serious."}
{"text":"I heard this place had great burgers so figured I'd give it a try. Turns out it wasn't worth wasting my money on which is really too bad because the restaurant is really nice looking and could be great, they just need to learn how to make a really good burger and maybe bring the price down a little as well."}
