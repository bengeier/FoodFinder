{"text":"Best eggs I've ever had!  Food is fresh and delicious. Coffee is also good. This place hits all the important items you look for in a breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Overall they have good dessert but they can't seem to make iced coffees...there have been SEVERAL times where they have giving me what I believe to be expired iced coffees.... I have brought this to their attention and nothing has been done to prevent this from occurring in the future. They DO NOT make their iced coffees on the spot. They pre-make their iced coffee in advanced and is then stored in a gallon. I'm staying away from their iced coffees and you should too..."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. the breakfast is good. The staff seems friendly enough.  The macaroons are disappointing.although tasty, they are a little soggier than I would prefer. The Union at Biltmore has far better macaroons than these and 2-3 times the variety."}
{"text":"I originally was recommended to the Essence Bakery in Tempe by 2 friends.  But we went over there on a Saturday morning and it was packed!  Which is not a bad thing, but we were hungry right then, so we left.  We were really excited when the Arcadia location opened up because it's a lot closer to us.  We've been to this location several times and we really do like the atmosphere that fits right in with the \"Arcadia style\".  You can walk in the front door or the back door and people will greet you with a friendly smile.  We've been in enough that the owner Eugenia knows us and always makes a point to say hello to us, which we love and appreciate.

And about the food... I've had 4 kinds of croissants and they are ALL DELICIOUS. The almond croissant and the almond chocolate croissant have a really unique flavor. And for those of you who like a more savory croissant, then the Gruyère is for you.  It's not covered in cheese, it's somehow folded in to the pastry.

Essence has other things as well such as Macarons and éclairs which are also very very good. In addition they have a nice breakfast and lunch menu. I highly recommend checking it out.  I know we'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"No esta bueno compared to the Tempe location. Saw a case full of massive, beautiful pain au chocolat. Ordered one to munch on while waiting for our sandwiches. Turned around for a second. Next thing I know I have this sad, orphan looking piece of bread in front of me. What a pain, getit?

Was planning on eating here but no outside seating for the dogs and took 40 minutes to make a sandwich. The lady behind the counter gave me a half snarl when I asked her to wrap the sandwiches up to go because why in the hell did it take 40 minutes to make a sandwich.

You sold me a bill of goods, Essence Arcadia. You're Tempe's evil twin sister and I won't forget it. 

Also, get it together with the outside seating. We live in ARIZONA. AMEYERIGHT?"}
{"text":"My early lunch partner and I went Friday to lovely new cafe. I had the egg sandwich and she the big breakfast.  We have been fans of the Tempe site for years. What is wonderful about this place is the quality and care that goes into the food.  The eggs are not overcooked, but actually still creamy and sprinkled with chives. My egg sandwich was on a fresh brioche made at the restaurant.  The potatoes on the big breakfast wasn't the usual fried hashbrowns, but a potato galette with a crisp exterior. 

Our order was more than enough for the two of us (we ended up getting a chocolate croissant to split).  We are average eaters---I don't look at meals as an opportunity to \"fill up,\" but I never skip a meal, either.  

This end of Indian School is becoming quite the restaurant row.  Essence is a nice addition."}
{"text":"I am so glad that I visited this restaurant in spite of several negative reviews.  Four of us went for lunch today.  We found only one parking space available in the rear which wasn't too bad because they have a rear entry door.  At 1215PM the place was quite full but tables were available.  On entry we were given menus to look at before we went to the Order Desk.  No line.  Several items were explained to us which was quite helpful.  There is a self-serve cold drink stand along side of the Order Desk which is normal in any place that does not take table orders.  Hot or specialty drinks are delivered to your table.  We ordered four different dishes and it took the kitchen about 10 minutes to prepare and bring them to our table.  Everything was fresh, warm and nicely presented.  I had the Grilled Mozzarella Cheese, Tomato & Basil Sandwich Focaccia bread with a side of Dijon Potatoes.  A fantastically delicious meal.  My wife ordered the Spanakopita with the Greek Village Salad on the side.  The other had Chicken Pot Pie and the fourth had the Pears& Blue Cheese Sammie Salad.  Each looked so good that we shared a bite with each other.  Everything was so tasteful that we vowed to order each others dish on our return.  Efficient, friendly and delicious.  I highly recommend this place to everyone.  Some might think it a bit pricey (I didn't) but if you do, it's one heck of a trade-off for the quality you get.  A great breakfast place and even a better luncheon place.  Yes, we all departed with our quota of freshly baked goodies!"}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to fall in love but I didn't.  Took friend to lunch today, she ordered spinach parmesan soup.  5 leaves of spinach in clear broth topped with \"cheese\"? She said it tasted like egg and it sure looked it.  I ordered Lemon Basil Chicken Sandwich.  Now I made a mistake as I expected Chicken Salad.  But I've had better sandwiches from the GROCERY STORE! Bun cold and not soft or crunchy...plain nothingness. A tiny portion of \"salad\" on the bun. No lettuce, tomato..a good pickle slice but that's it.  Just a disappointment all the way around.  At least could have toasted the bun...or given me a choice of toasted or not..or other bread choices. NO bun costs $8.50! It was all bread. Fancy 2 inch (Largest) cookies are $3.00 each.  Smaller ones are $17 per dz.  Gheesh! Yikes!"}
{"text":"Essence is one of my favorite spots for lunch in the area.  My favorites are the arugula bacon salad and pear/blue cheese sammie salad.  I've tried many of the daily specials and have not been disappointed.  The ingredients are fresh and often local and organic, the combinations are unique and inventive, and the food is always an excellent quality.  The pastries are incredible.  I've tried all the croissants (yum!) and usually leave with a few macarons.  I recommend the pumpkin spice and vanilla rum macarons."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the Tempe location and was excited by the prospect of having one open closer to home.  While the food was excellent, the service is a nightmare.  The person taking orders was clearly not trained well.  While we waited for our food, they tried to deliver the wrong order to the table next to us and then acted like it was the customer's fault.

Our food arrived and and both meals were delicious.  Then the snag.....there was a bone about two inches long and the diameter of a toothpick in my chicken pot pie.  Since this could actually be dangerous if swallowed, I felt like I should let the manager know.  I made it clear that the food was great but that I thought they should be aware of the bone problem.  The manager just shrugged and said, \"We cook our own chickens and sometimes that happens.\"  This response was wrong in so many ways.  No \"I'm sorry,\" \"We\"ll check into it so it doesn't happen again,\" or even a \"Let us buy you a cookie.\"  Just a shrug and an excuse.

The food is good, but not worth putting yourself through the shoddy customer service."}
{"text":"Divine.  The chicken pot pie is to-die-for good and the tarts and macarons are scrumptious.  The side salads are good too, nice and fresh with a light-tasting dressing.

You order at the counter and get your own drinks unless it's a coffee drink.  They bring your food out to your table.  Service was good, they bussed the table well while we were eating and brought to-go containers in a timely manner.  The huge mixer in the main part of the dining area is quite a conversation piece as well."}
{"text":"The bakery section is excellent! But breakfeast is not that hot,.they dont give you enough and you pay on the side for the side orders, luke bacon or sausage,  i ordered the french toast and no way to just ask for a side of bacon, you have to get back in line and wait forever!! Bad system they have on orders!! Wont go back, if you order OJ,.its warm!! Other places way better to go too!!"}
{"text":"I still love Essence and come here frequently! I'm always recommending Essence to friends and family, and forever taking the mini macarons to functions or potlucks. Seriously these are the best macarons I've ever tasted, you have to try them! The coffee, brunch and lunch are also fantastic. 5 stars over and over again."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. The service is horrific. Got there early to beat the lunchtime rush. They offered a special that included soup. The dish arrived. No soup. 'No worries... Can you please bring it anyway. I will be paying for it'. 15 mins later, it still wasn't delivered. I got in line and paid for it, leaving my lunch on the table. 15 mins later, it still hadn't been delivered. I flagged two staff members. \"Would it be possible to bring my soup?\"  They blew me off. I asked to speak with the owner. Sacre Bleu ...zut alors. She blew me off. I left having paid for my soup and declared that I would never go back. If you want great food with obnoxious French attitude, Essence is all that. But in a town where there are other fantastic bakers with equal flare, but without high prices and lackluster service, why bother."}
{"text":"Great food concept in a fun little restaurant space. Unfortunately the staff are slightly inexperienced, but the experience is more than compensated by the kitchen staff, which are top notch! 

Tip: try the Huevos Rancheros"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Had the vegetarian special on Thursday and it was perfection.  Veggie side salad crisp and lemon dressing light and flavorful.  BUT the coconut cream pie I ordered for my husband's birthday is hands down the best we've ever had!!  Instead of custard or cream, Eugenia whips up the creamiest meringue to top this pie.  A must try for you coconut lovers!"}
{"text":"Cute cafe, cute decor-and the best chocolate almond croissant! Would definitely come back for more. Totally worth the price."}
{"text":"First time Yelper here.  I really like this place.  I love the pastries (on par with what you would find in France), their homemade coffee drinks (no commercially made syrups), the Greek platter, and ice teas.  They taste genuine.  I can always find a parking space, and the service is friendly.  I usually end up near the 44th and Camelback corridor for breakfast or weekend lunch, and since discovering this place a couple of months ago, I nearly always end up here now.  I travel quite a bit near and far for both business and leisure; we Phoenicians are lucky to have this place."}
{"text":"Essence bakery is a family friendly spot and I love going there for a light breakfast with my 2 1/2 year old! The staff is awesome and always attentive to their customers.  The pastries are the best in town and the over-easy eggs are sooooo goooood that I don't think you can find them as yummy anywhere else! Coffee is great and iced latte is perfect, not too heavy on the milk and you can actually taste the espresso! Love love the atmosphere! No wi-fi but it's refreshing that people are not sitting around on their phones and you can actually spot people reading an actual book or two from time to time!"}
{"text":"Great croissants and bread.  Bad employee attitude towards customers."}
{"text":"Essence is one of my favorite weekend brunch spots. My husband often orders the French Toast, and I often get the Vegetarian Big Breakfast. The potato croquette in my breakfast is so flavorful and tasty, I could eat that all day. 

Their macarons are quite good, though a bit sweet for my taste. But they have other excellent dessert options to choose from.

Sometimes the wait for food can be a bit long, but no big deal. It gets a bit busy. Twice we've had to wait a while, and both times we were offered a free chocolate croissant--so good :)"}
{"text":"As a long time weekly customer of the Tempe location, I was very excited that this location opened up in my neighborhood. One by work (Tempe) one by home (Phx). Since I usually eat there for lunch while at work, it took me a while to try the new spot, which I did today for the first time.

Food: Excellent
Interior: New, modern, spacious - very nice
Ordering process: Annoying
Parking: VERY limited - go during off peak hours

The new location is really nice and open; it feels much less cramped than the Tempe location.
I ordered the special which was soup and salad with one of my favorite Essence soups - the butternut squash - and it was great, as always.

So I think the food will be good at both locations, but I did notice some of the issues that the other reviewers pointed out.

1 - I was in line behind a group of people standing at the counter trying to decide what to order. They were taking forever and never stepped to the side to let other \"ready\" customers place their orders. There are two registers and one line, but some people cut in front of me and went to the other register...they need to be more clear about the lines and how to order. Most people go there for lunch and have limited time, so efficiency is important. It is the same way at Tempe, but I think because the place is smaller it's easier to figure out what's going on and how the flow works.

2 - PARKING - there is not enough parking! This drives me nuts!!! Why open a restaurant that seats more than 10 tables and have only 10 parking spots. A building with a tiny parking lot is NOT a good location for a restaurant. There are no side streets to park on either. This is like another LGO situation...no parking and I refuse to valet my car to get a salad and dessert to go.(at LGO, Essence does not offer valet) I'm just making the point that you lose customers if there is not enough parking."}
{"text":"Just so so for breakfast.  Service is poor but pastries are amazing.  Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Have been coming in a lot lately.   Owners are really cool.  Great cooks.  Gracious hosts.   I like the breakfasts more than lunch but both good.   Ice tea tasty and you can serve yourself.   Service good.    Clean and comfortable.   Desserts Delish if that's your thing too.   I dig it.  Comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"This experience at Essence in Arcadia was not what we thought it would be and we were very disappointed with our meals and the service. We are in town from Las Vegas for work and originally from Chicago. We went to Essance Bakery (Arcadia Location), because I saw this restaurant/bakery and the chef featured on the local news and I couldn't wait to go and try the napoleon with fruit that was featured as the special of the month, the brunch special, other pastries, the macaroons, and the strawberry rhubarb jam. We went for a late breakfast (almost lunch time), they were out of the featured dessert, which was disappointing, but it happens so I figured we would come back another day to one of the two locations to try the Napoleon and to pick up the other items. I ordered the brunch special, which comes with peppered bacon and I was asked how I wanted the bacon cooked and my fiancé ordered the egg, bacon breakfast sandwich and an orange juice.  When our food was brought to the table there was no bacon, so I asked for my bacon. The server said \"okay\", but never brought it, so I just ate my pancakes. My fiancés egg, bacon breakfast sandwich was cold and the egg part, cold, cold, but he ate it. We were so hungry and had already waited a while for our food. The restaurant was not very busy, the server was not busy, so why no bacon ever came and why the sandwich was cold we don't understand. At the end of meal we let another server know about the bacon and cold sandwich and for $30 this meal was not worth it and we were disappointed. The server brought out a manager and we were told we could get a coupon for a free meal next time, or free croissants, but with our experience and that we are going back home early next week, we are not so sure we would come back, free croissants don't fix anything, so we were told would get credit ($3) for the bacon and not too much of an apology, and no real explanation or anything. I advised please just let the owners know, so this can be corrected. To get our little $3 credit we would have to wait behind a line of customers, since only one register was open so we just left, since it's not worth the $3. I am sure the pastries are good and they look amazing. I have tried pastries all over the u.s. and Europe and was really looking forward to this visit and another one to pick up pastries before we go back home, but the food and service today ruined it. Maybe Essence should just stay with pastries and breads or hire better staff if cooking and serving what is to be fresh, good quality and bit pricey for the quantity food."}
{"text":"As a big supporter of Local First AZ businesses, I will not be supporting this business. First, the guy who took our order was a bit frazzled and it was difficult to ask any questions. Then we ordered the hummus and bread w/cukes asking for more cukes than bread. Now, I've eaten hummus and cucumbers all over the Valley and this was truly pitiful. 3, yes I said 3 of the most thinly sliced cucumber slices I've ever seen. Not sure how I was supposed to eat a mound of hummus with those paper thin slices. I went up to ask for more cucumbers and they charged me $1. Well, I wanted to eat the hummus so I paid. 10 minutes later I'm still waiting for the $1 order of cucumbers. Nothing. I waited 5 more minutes thinking, maybe they're trying to slice them even thinner? Nope, they just didn't come, and going up to the counter wasn't really an option, no one there could do more than one thing at a time. SO, Essence Bakery Café, consider my dollar a donation and the last time I go there. It's so disappointing when the locally owned restaurants do it this way...luckily there are plenty more to check out, and plenty I've been to that got 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Biked here for breakfast this morning and both enjoyed what we got. My husband had the eggs benedict and I had a fried egg sandwich. Both were delish.

Unfortunately, the coffee is just okay. We also got an eclair to go (not realizing it was $6!), which was really good as long as you don't mind it has a chocolate filling (with whiskey in it we were told). 

I already know the macaroons are good, so we didn't need to get any of those this time around. 

We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I feel like I just need to say it - please get some new coffee!  That nicaraguan blend is really bad.  Acidic and watery.  Doesn't seem like it would take much to rotate it with another blend.  I would come there more often in the mornings if I didn't have to suffer through your coffee.  And I'm not hating on Nicaraguan coffee - my wife is from Nicaragua, we go there a lot, and I know they have great coffee - but I don't know where you found that stuff.   Get rid of it."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. I am ALWAYS blown away by my meals there. The owner is a fantastic lady that loves what she does for a living, and it shows in both her personality and her food. I've been several times for either breakfast or lunch and have never once left unsatisfied!"}
{"text":"The food, coffee are a 5. Their baked goods are the best in the city. The service gets a 2. A lot of the staff acts like they are doing you a favor when waiting on the customers.

I have to give them another star for their chocolate almond croissant. It's too tasty.

Just tried to place a phone order. After speaking to 2 different people come to find out they find phone orders too distracting. Why don't you try disconnecting your phone and locking the door? Essence loves baking but hates the people who buy their food. Stop holding our croissants hostage! Readjusted back down to a 3 rating because your employees are acting like the president.

Had to update again due to an ethereal pistachio cinnamon roll that was served with a smile & thank you."}
{"text":"Hooray for new neighborhood restaurants! What a cute space with great food with French flair. Simple menu done well but wouldn't mind if the menu was a bit bigger. I plan to come back and try various things on the menu. They even have a pretty good parking lot which is hard to find in Arcadia! Friendly staff, good vibe and cool atmosphere. Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Wow. Croissants tres bien. Owners were wonderful. We Just moved to Arcadia from Gilbert, and may have just found our new favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"The pastries at essence are amazing. But its wierd that the coffee is so bad. I have to go to Starbucks before I come here, that's not right."}
{"text":"The food here is simply amazing! We had the breakfast sandwich and a chocolate croissant. They take an ordinary item and make it extraordinary. That sandwich was amazing and fairly priced! The macarons are truly amazing and worth every penny.  The vanilla bean is by far the best but they are all great! Do not come here an leave without trying one, they are delicious! Exceptional quality and great prices."}
{"text":"A coworker who lives in Tempe originally suggested I try Essence. My first visit was to buy croissants for a meeting at the office and my highly picky boss (he says nobody can beat his wife's baking) asked me where I got them. SCORE!

The next three or so times I got the egg salad sandwich. I can't eat cheese or mushrooms so I am very limited by menus. But I love egg salad. Each time over a many month time span I had egg shells in the egg salad (YUCK). I see a problem they need to work on there. Nobody wants to eat egg shells.

So the next visit I decided to spend the extra money and I got the chicken pot pie and I fell in love! Their chicken pot pie is not traditionally made with pie dough. They put it in a flaky pastry. It has chicken, peas and carrots (no mushrooms). 

I have gotten this twice and it is a big hit with me. 

I also get a pastry each time and all have been good."}
{"text":"Such a fun place with cute decor and yummy food! Perfect hangout spot with girlfriends especially, if you want some sandwiches or desserts. I had the jalapeño croque-monsieur with potato salad. I loved it. Sandwich was savory, creamy with a little kick. Potato salad was yummy and perfect for a hot Arizona day. If you do not like mustard though, I suggest you skip it. I will be returning to try more stuff"}
{"text":"This is an update to remind myself that I can pass on the croissants here next time I'm passing thru. The last two times I have been disappointed. My changing tastes? Who knows."}
{"text":"Oh don't I feel foolish!  11 months later, and I JUST noticed a lovely message from one of the owners.  Giles thanked me for my review, said the counter person was mistaken and should have taken the phone order, and promised to make sure counter personnel were properly informed in the future.  That is exactly the kind of response great management should have, so now I'm an even bigger fan.  He also offered some goodies to make up for not getting the pastry boxes on the special occasion.  That was very generous, but unnecessary (and far too late now!).  I'll be back regardless, although these days I'm trying to avoid gluten most of the time, so pastries are a rare treat now.  Wonder if they'll ever add some gluten free options?  Hint, hint!"}
{"text":"Great setvice and atmosphere.  Fast servuce and good food.   Loved the mashed potatoe pancacke and homemade sausage.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good, loved the atmosphere and the friendly service. They were super helpful with my allergies, just wish they had more gluten free baked goods, and gluten free bread. 
But the gluten free macaroons were amazing!"}
{"text":"The owner refused to talk to me when I asked to speak to her (even though she was a few feet away in the kitchen).  I attempted to place a holiday order that was advertised in multiple places along the counter and at the register.  I was told they were not taking any more orders, even though the sign was right in front of me and the deadline had not passed.  I politely asked to speak to the owner since I was a regular customer.  She refused to walk over to talk to me.  It was so rude and appalling.  I will never go back.  No customer should ever be treated that way."}
{"text":"They have amazing iced coffee. I recommend the vanilla or caramel glacé. I've always experienced good service in the morning."}
{"text":"Overcroweded, overpriced, no customer service, no attention to details.
If u were to go, order pastry. Breakfast otherwise disapoints"}
{"text":"At last, Phoenix has a delicious, modern bakery. There is a giant mixer that greet you as you open the front door! This food is made with the finest, purest ingredients. Today I ordered a chicken sandwich that totally\"hit it out of the park.\"  It came with a delicious side of field greens with the best dressing. The chicken was not\"lunch meat\", but was off a roasted chicken. But the best, dessert: coconut cream pie. The lemonade is fresh squeezed and left me pining for more! This will be my regular go to lunch place! Eugenia, the chef, has been a staple in Phoenix area for  her culinary talents. I believe she trained in Paris, and it shows. I like going up and ordering at the counter, it is quick and easy.I went a bit early, around 11,  and avoided some of the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Hamburger was cooked perfectly. Topped with spinach and a roll with pumpkin seeds in it. Tasty potato salad on the side. Companion had one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches he'd ever had. Dubliner cheddar with bacon and apple jelly on it. Came with a side of lentil soup. Fabulous lunch!  Topped it off with chocolate croissants. A perfect lunch!"}
{"text":"I stop in here every Sunday morning with the girls from my spin class at MiC and absolutely love it! Prices for drinks aren't my fav but they taste so good it's worth it xoxox"}
{"text":"Quiche Lorraine- 5/5 Very moist yet firm. Fruit bowl was very fresh and amazingly delicious. 
Wife had Signature Sausage Turnover and said she couldn't get enough. Tres Yummy!
Daughter had fresh Peach Pie. She downed it sooo quickly!
As for the Macarons... Lemon is 5/5
Raspberry has rose oil in it and to me it is overpowering. I give it 3/5 but wife and daughter says 4.5/5 stars. 
Chocolate... Wife says 5/5 stars. 
We made a special trip here bc this was in the AZCentral.com's 10 Best French Restaurants. Food wise- 100% agree!
Decor is too modern for my liking. I don't feel like I'm in France, but inside a college campus cafe."}
{"text":"Being European this is the best place in Arcadia and Biltmore. The owner is French and always greets her costumers. Salads are all organic from local farmers. Desserts are amazing from macaroons to Napoleon to croissants. Fresh baguettes are made every morning around 10:30AM. Must try!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. 
My wife ordered a salad with no cheese and when she got home there was cheese on the salad. She called to have them make the right salad, but they argued with her that there was no cheese on it. They even went as far to call back again and have us double check if there was cheese and have us bring the salad back with us. Ha!  
The lady with the Hispanic accent who claims to be the manager was very rude. 
She has ensured this was our first, and last, visit. 
We will NOT be returning to Essence with that kind of customer service."}
{"text":"where to start. Lets start with todays breakfast special. Eggs Benedict. Most places that serve the good ole eggs Benedict you get watery, crappy tasting hollandaise. Not at Essence! It is silky, smooth, and has a slight tang too it. It is one of THE best hollandaise that I have ever tasted. Eggs poached to perfection, fluffy buttery brioche, crispy potatoes..my mouth is watering just thinking about it. GIVE ME MORE!...ok moving on. along with my delicious breakfast I got a caramel latte. I am a stickler when it comes to espresso, and the lady who did mine this morning had that barista magic. temp was right on point, nice creamy smooth foam. loved how the caramel did not over power the espresso. All in all two thumbs up!

 keep doin ya thang Essence!"}
{"text":"I closed my eyes and tasted breakfast in Paris. Excellent quality, European portioned, delicious. I can't wait to return. (Eggs, potatoes, croissant, and great coffee.)"}
{"text":"Managed to pop in a couple minutes before they closed and didn't get any attitude from the cashier, which was appreciated.  That said, 3pm is an awfully early closing time.

I bought a large mint chocolate macaron ($3.42 after tax before tip).  It had a lovely moist texture inside.  The outer creme center was crusted with solid chocolate chips but I feel like a chocolate dip/shell/coat on the bottom half would have made for a better flavor.  My complaint is that it didn't really taste like mint.  The dominant flavors were vanilla and chocolate.  The very dark green dyed color has me wondering how much food coloring they use, and if it's natural or not.  Still, the gooey center was fantastic.

The pricing here is quite high, though the quality seems good.  I probably won't be back often as it's not very convenient for me compared to bakeries like Urban Cookies or AJ's/Whole Foods, and the fact that I really don't like driving down Indian School Road (the traffic situation on the street with so many street lights is awful, the right lane of the two lane side of the road is always stopping due to heavy pedestrian traffic and people pulling into the businesses that don't have turn lanes).  They're also closing the bakery for two weeks of the summer.

I do appreciate the bakery not imposing a minimum or fee on credit card purchases, as that's a major pet peeve of mine that has me avoid places.

Overall, my mint chocolate macaron wasn't minty, so I cannot give more than 3 stars.  It was a delightful dessert, but it was not what was promised."}
{"text":"This place is great however it can be difficult to find parking so give yourself plenty of time. I love all of their sandwiches and salads. Do not leave without a macaroon!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local spots and one reason I'll never be able to move out of PHX. The food is top notch, best latte in town and don't even get me started on the pastries....! However, what really keeps me going back again and again is the amazing staff and the woman behind it all! The owner is so kind and takes the time to chat with her customers. Such great service that you can only expect from a local business! Definitely check it out, this place is a local gem. :)"}
{"text":"great breakfast place. Good quiche Great egg special with fresh salsa avocado. Wonderful  Fantastic croissants tarts and macaroons"}
{"text":"Out of sticky buns, chocolate almond croissant limited parking.  Arrive at 8:30 and not much left.  Very disappointed again second day in a row and went to different location."}
{"text":"Pretty exceptional quiche. My boyfriend picked it up to go so I didn't get to see the inside of this place but the food was very yummy. Got a perfectly sized quiche with super flaky delicious crust. Maybe slightly too oniony for me but I would definitely eat it again. It also comes with the best fruit cup I've ever gotten. Ate the whole thing. Can't wait to try more things on their menu."}
{"text":"So I was making my espresso at home on this gloomy morning, and it hit me for some odd reason that I felt so empty drinking it without a delicious pastry to go with it. 

Brushed that empty feeling aside and proceeded to check my Facebook feed (because that's what a normal millennial does every morning!). And then I saw my friend's post who's currently in Paris enjoying her Parisian croissant. 

That crushed me. That was one of those moments where social scientists say that Facebook can't be good for you. Staring at my lonesome espresso, I was really upset. 

So, whatevs, let me check my gmail.... Ooh KJZZ March offers! And just like an answered prayer, there it was -- a 10% discount for a bakery called Essence Bakery. I read the short description, checked Yelp, and BAM! We have a winner. 

Checked myself in the mirror, drove myself to the bakery and ordered every single croissant and the pecan sticky bun. Mmmmm. Just the right amount of \"fluffiness\", soft and tender in your mouth! 

Took my order home and brewed another round of espresso... I have to say, my espresso looked like a high roller rap star flanked by all these beautiful and delicious croissants! You go, bruh!

From now on, as long as I live in this state, this will be my bakery and my source for all pastries!"}
{"text":"On a short trip from calif saw the AZ news this morning that featured Essence Bakery so went there... The macaroons and cookies are YUM! Bought a bunch to go and will come back the next time I'm in town...so glad I happened to be watching the local news"}
{"text":"We had the most amazing breakfast at Essence! The owners are wonderful. They take time to come and chat to you. The sweets are to die for! We couldn't eat everything we wanted so we bought some extra home for dessert later today"}
{"text":"I got a recommendation to try this place from a foody friend who has been to their other location in Tempe. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves French-style breakfast and pastries! They serve breakfast all day on Saturday and Sunday so even if you get a late start you can still get breakfast.

As soon as we walked in and started looking at the menu the owner approached us and explained every item on their menu. She was very friendly and helpful. The food came out quickly and was to die for. I ordered the French scramble- the eggs are light, fluffy, and packed with flavor! It also comes with fantastic peppered bacon! As a thank you for trying out her restaurant the owner sent us two complimentary croissants, one chocolate and one almond, which were also mind-numbingly delicious. Will definitely be going there for breakfast again!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer of Essence for several years, so this review is long overdue. If you love fresh delicious food prepared by a real chef this is the place for you. Consistently great quality. Just had the veggie Tues. special which was to die for. The Arcadia location is hip and comfortable and I enjoy hanging out here. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! We come here on for brunch often and I think I've tried most of their breakfast menu. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the French toast, the syrup wasn't great in my opinion, but the people I was with tried it & loved it.  

Today I got the Chicken Club on a croissant with potato salad. I have dreams about this sandwich...add avocado if you want to raise the yum factor! The potato salad is okay, it's heavy on the mustard seeds which isn't my favorite. 

The desserts and croissants are always fresh and the selection is always different, so we always try different things. I stuck with macaroons today, which I've tried before and they are always fantastic."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the Tempe location...the Spanikopita and salad entree is one of my favorite lunches.  I'm glad they have opened another location with more room, closer to my neck of the woods, so I  met up with a buddy for brunch .  I like the space a LOT...it's laid out nicely but would benefit from some sound dampening.  I ordered the special...quinoa & root veggie hash, eggs, and a spinach & greyere croissant and it was yummy.  The coffee was fabulous as well!    My buddy had the breakfast sandwich and enjoyed it as well.  All in all, this was an enjoyable meal.  So, how do they get more stars???  Pacing.....my friend got brekkie a good 7 minutes before I did.  I don't necessarily mind a wait but bringing the food together makes things less awkward.  The table beside us had a longer time gap than we did, so there is room for improvement.  All in all, things went well; making that small change will get loyal, repeat customers!"}
{"text":"Yum!  An out of town friend told me about this place so I made the drive just for breakfast.  Was it ever worth it.  The chocolate croissants were to die for (like we got in Europe) and the French Toast with banana caramel sauce was very good too.

The place has a great vide to it and the decor is very comfortable.  What a great experience, I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I arrived here a few minutes after 11 craving breakfast. I figured this type of place served breakfast all day. Unfortunately they ended it at 11. Being that the place was empty and I drove a ways to check it out,  I kindly asked if they'd make an exception. All I really wanted was quiche... not a difficult thing to heat up. The girls at the counter didn't even ask the chefs. They just told me no and that it was \"put away\". Understandable if they were packed,  but there were 2 other customers. Pretty lame. Also, the pastry case was empty aside from macarons. I'm writing this review from Jewel's bakery a couple miles away... full pastry case,  full restaurant and breakfast served all day... hmmm."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, and I honestly do, as certain things are done very well, but some are not. Here's my ratings : look/ feel 5 stars, coffee 5 stars, food pastries - simple organic 5 stars, service 2.5 stars, price 2 stars.  A bit too expensive for what you get, and the length of time it takes to whip up some eggs was unacceptable.  I'll probably be back at some point, but won't be one of my go to's."}
{"text":"This place is LIFE! Everything is specifically made to make a bad day disappear. Breakfast, lunch, pastries, coffee: I don't understand how one place can be fantastic at literally *all* the things. My absolute favorite thing to get is the French scrambled egg breakfast. Macarons with espresso are a close second. I adore this place. EAT HERE ALWAYS!"}
{"text":"Update in response to comment: I would love to come back and take advantage of your offer in the below comment but I never keep receipts nor did I get one the day of my purchase. 

So disappointing. We spent over $10 on 3 macarons and 2 of the 3 were stale and hard as rocks! We drove up from Ahwatukee because we love macarons and we're excited to try this place. What a waste of time and money. So sad."}
{"text":"Fairly simple order of chocolate croissant at $3.75 here in this new bakery. I knew these were good since I have had them in Tempe. This location is alot nicer and roomier and the food is exactly the same. It is an unusual version of a croissant as there are two \"bars\" of chocolate inside on both sides, but not up the middle. Still very flaky as evidenced by crumbs in my car. Not the greatest ever due to the style, but worthy of a treat every so often and the ones with powdered sugar looked even better."}
{"text":"We went to Essence early this Sunday at 7 a m and we both chose to have croissants! I chose the pistachio and my husband, of course, had the chocolate one! Neither of us opted to share a bite because neither of us wanted to share one morsel! It was as good of pastry as I have ever had either here in the u s or France. MERCI! 
I was surprised how mediocre the coffee was (and that's being kind). They said it was Italian. I've had coffee in Italy and lots of other places.  We both agreed on the pastry and the coffee.  We will definitely return for the bakery items and maybe for breakfast next time!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe how awesome the Americanos and the food are!  Beautiful building and incredible staff - my new fav in the hood"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix! The pastries are always made fresh and on busy days they will sometimes run out. 

The staff is all nice. You order your food at the counter and then they bring it to you."}
{"text":"Had a cappuccino. just awful., I couldnt figure out why, I even added sugar, which I never do, still couldnt drink it, finally said something to the waittress,, she responds oh, we use 2 shots of espresso, REALLLY? WISH SOMEONE HAD TOLD ME PRIOR.

The wait for the $12.95 egg breakfast was 45 mins... ridickoulous.

Then the \" owner\" stands nx the the table next to us, with his ass in my face , chatting for 30mins,,, very uncomfortable...

will NOT return..."}
{"text":"One of my family members brought me here after yoga. HOLY COW! SERIOUSLY. If there is one thing I Love in this life, It's a damn good croissant. And they're hard to find. A TRULY great croissant. And here at Essence? I think I have to say top croissant ever. ALSO, the macarons. I've always sort of detested macarons in general. They always seem like dry puffs of air. Well, I tried a few of their large size macarons and I think I finally understand what a macaron is supposed to taste like. The raspberry rose on tastes like silky sweet flowers, and the lemon one was SO delightful. 
We went there once more on our way out of town, & got breakfast and pastries to go. I also have to vouche for their french scrambled eggs, and potato cake. They just do everything here so well, there is not words....
Thank you Essence Bakery. I Love you!"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice but both times it was exceptional! Today I had the Quiche Lorraine which was amazing, filling but not overwhelming. I'm a huge fan of anything that contains bacon so this was a real treat :) and I haven't been able to find anywhere else in phoenix that makes such yummy macaroons! Must try!"}
{"text":"Wonderful!! Friendly, clean, fresh, unique. 

Essence Bakery (this location) was amazing!! We stopped in for a breakfast sandwich and a cup of coffee after running an errand on Saturday morning and we're pleasantly surprised by our experience. We were greeted with smiles and when they found out if was our first visit, both women behind the counter, one of which was Lisa, helped us pick out some of their unique pastries and were kind and patient. We ended up buying 2 croissants - one baked with honey and one pumpkin and their classic breakfast sandwich. AMAZING!! Fresh and flavorful. Lisa came over and asked about our experience and brought it to our attention that if you come around 9ish AM on Saturday, that's when another round of pastries are coming out of the oven. Let's just say, the chocolate croissants are worth it! I highly recommend this place and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So much yes! Their coffee is some of my favorite in all of Phoenix! Then their macaroons & pastries are to die for. Honestly could eat everything they make and be happy. You can their special ingredient is love!"}
{"text":"You might be asking yourself, \"Lance, why do you go to places like this, you're clearly a man's man, who takes no prisoners, and loves bad bitches\" TRUE. Valid points.  Keeping prisoners in my house would be burdensome and annoying so I generally don't do it, and my love for bad bitches is equal to my love for getting vulgar on yelp.  However, I get dragged to places like this by a woman who thinks places like this are cute. I complain, but I go for the writing material, and to get it out of the way. Otherwise, I'll be hearing about trying this place for the next 5 months.

Some people think I'm angry, some people think this is rude and disrespectful. Fuck all y'all.  If my business was shitty (not possible, but lets roll with the hypothetical) I would appreciate hearing about it and try to fix it.  Sadly, this is the 2nd location of a place that's been open forever and not the first review where people bring these facts up....so do they just not care?

Moving ON:

No one that's ever worked for, or at this company has spent more than 10 seconds thinking about business decisions, process, or even money.  I'm talking general currency, how it works....how we can exchange it for goods...how to get more of it...preferably in a shorter period of time.....like prior to death.

GET THE FUCK OFF ME SON.

There's 3 distinct things going on at this place

1) People are trying to order food, from a menu, at a counter...ok simple enough.

2) People are trying to order a pastry, or maybe $200 worth of them at same counter

3) People are trying to get coffee drinks.....or are they?

SEPARATE YOUR FUCKING CUSTOMERS

Group 3 is basically fucked, because there is no drink menu.  There is thousands of dollars of barrister equipment sitting over in a corner, but it's a complete waste if no one even knows what to order. A baby could figure this shit out.  If your theory is: \"WELL WE CAN MAKE ANYTHING\"...well fuck yourself, because most humans are crippled by open ended decisions, and I didn't see shit coming out of that area the entire time I was here.  I was asked what I wanted to drink...and I said..ummm....? I suppose water...you have to have that, right? FAIL 1. Drinks are always the money maker. They should be front and center.

Group 2 is a bunch of old women who want to bring like 60 macaroons back to their house and have a retirement party. Pure golden girls shit..\"Let's get 20, no 30 no 100...ahhhahah....lets do 3 dozen of one and 4 x 2/3 dozens of each of these other 3 hhaha..MACAROON heaven!!! Ohhh gloria you old bag, I promise I won't tell your doctor...my grandkids are going to shit themselves worse than Gladys did last night at bingo\" FUCK OUT THE WAY. I'm hung over, and I'm starving....Get Themla and Louise over to their own register like every other place that offers bakery items....OR fucking come to my table and wait on me. I don't know the split of your revenue, but whatever it is, segregate this shit. Sorry bout it Brown Vs. Board of Education.

Group 1 is me, I don't eat sweets, because I save my diabetes risk for alcohol. Also, I\"m hungry and NO MOTHER FUCKERS I DON'T WANT SALAD.

You can have any side you want, as long as it's potato salad or shitty leaves we picked off the bushes in the front. WRONG ANSWER.

Every place like this has a burger...thank fucking god..because when women start restaurants like this...strictly for other women..someone says: \"I know this is going to sound crazy....but what if a man comes in??...like by accident or whatever??? Ok fine, we'll make a burger...BUT we'll look down on you when you order it, we'll take 40 minutes to make it, and we'll assume you're a republican, with no soul, your life is probably in a downward spiral, you probably beat your wife, and also NEVER COME BACK EVER fuckface man.\"

So anyways, I got the burger....it was actually good, but it didn't fill me up, and neither did the 7 leaf salad....so I went to Pita Jungle where I ordered, ate, and paid in less time than I waited in line at whatever this place is called I'm reviewing.

PS: There's fricken 12 people working in here.There's also 12 people working at Zipps across the way. Which is at least 5x bigger, bar + full menu and is ASS PACKED. Lesson: Process improvement."}
{"text":"Been going here for the last year - one of the finest French bakery's / café in town - - - real French croissant - - - great food - - wonderful pastries - - - and when the add to the sunday special, one of the finest eggs benedict on a fresh made roll, thinly sliced ham, perfectly good egg and a wonderful hollandaise worth exploring - my favorite"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by some of the bad reviews on here, as I've only had only good experiences at Essence. The service has always been friendly and efficient, and everything I've tried has been delicious. They have daily specials which I usually order that have always turned out to be a good choice. The portions are generous for the price, and they use high quality ingredients. At an average price of $10 for lunch, I think this is a great value compared to a lot of other restaurants in the neighborhood. After dining here several times I finally decided to try a mini caramel macaron. They forgot to bring it out with my meal, so to make up for it they brought me an extra vanilla one complimentary. Totally unnecessary, but a very nice gesture!  The macarons were as good as the ones I've had in Paris. I highly recommend the caramel one, so rich and amazing, I can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"I am a longtime Essence lover, but I just don't understand the little inconsistencies between locations. 

For example, the Mediterranean Platter has been slightly changed at this location. It's like somebody decided they wanted to put their own spin on it ... the horror.

Exhibit A: the baguette. What's the deal with the strip of bread sliced in half? In Tempe, the baguette consists of toasted slices of an actual baguette.

Exhibit B: the chopped Greek salad has spinach added to it. Why? It's so good the way it comes in Tempe. There is no need to add some dry ass leaves to it. 

In conclusion, I can't image the female version of Gordon Ramsay, who started Essence, would approve of someone messing with her creations (this is something I assume based on no evidence other than my imagination after little interaction). Also, I am way too into my food."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch the other day and ordered their Roasted Vegetable and Hummus sandwich and it was much better than I expected! I'm normally a meat eater but had been eating bad all week and decided I should order something \"healthier\".  I wasn't in the mood for a salad so I decided to try it and I was sooo pleased I did! It had so much flavor and was very filling! I didn't miss the meat at all! I didn't try the macaroons on this visit but have had them at their tempe location and they are fantastic! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you're trying to think of a unique treat to give your clients or colleagues {...or anyone, really!}, the AMAZING macarons from Essence are always a hit! They're so colorful and delicious. I usually have to order a mini one for myself as well. Shhh, don't tell!"}
{"text":"Can't make it to France for breakfast? Just go to Essence. Essence is at the top of the list of best breakfast and bakery."}
{"text":"Food was really good and pastries were all outstanding. Wait was a little long for lunch but wasn't too bad. A little expensive but not bad considering they use all local and organic ingredients."}
{"text":"I have been to Essence a few times and I have had wonderful experiences every time. Food there is delicious and I absolutely love the macaroons!"}
{"text":"That's right FIVE STARS! The food here is amazing... even if they do use Mc Lendon's... 
Do yourself a favor and try the eggplant special.
Aside from the amazing salads (arugula bacon is best in Arizona) you can check out all the rich Arcadia broads..."}
{"text":"Went strictly for the macaroons and at first I was thinking \"three dollars for one macaroon? Nope! No thank you.\" but I had made the trip so I needed to at least try it out. Tried it and the macaroons were light, moist and crunchy but only certain ones are worth three dollars. This would be a place I would go back to if I was craving a certain macaroon."}
{"text":"I was so amazed when I discovered the one in Tempe and then went into utter bliss when they decided to open this one in Arcadia. I adore that there is finally more breakfast options for Arcadia, naturally after I move out that zip code. 

 I'm not very good at waiting for food, I like to start with the pain au chocolate or the chocolate almond croissant with my coffee. You will not be disappointed by the quiche or the big breakfast, that jam is the star of the plate. However my ultimate fave is the huevos frenchos. Avocado, enough said. As if it is any mystery, I could never leave this place without a dozen of their macarons. I have a weakness for the french chocolate, hazelnut, raspberry rose, and key lime flavors. I can't describe enough how this little piece of patisserie can ensure happiness inhabits my every molecule.

You may find yourself darting from the yogis of OM to park here but it is worth it. Until my next return, you can leave your imprint on me any time my little cafe!"}
{"text":"I decided to stop in for some baked goods and coffee for dessert after lunch.  We found ourselves at the counter between 2 registers not being helped due to our unfortunate location whilst perusing the baked goods display.  Whatever.

We ordered an almond cookie, a chocolate macaroon and a chocolate almond croissant.  This came out to about 10 dollars.  Seeing as I didn't see coffee on the menu and had no idea what kind of pricing they decided to place on it I decided to get  the coffee elsewhere.  Make sure you watch them fill your order, the lady tried to give me a regular chocolate croissant.

So the macaroon I decided I like.  Its like a dense raw-in-the-middle brownie.  Or a truffle brownie dumpling.  Delightful.  

The cookie is mediocre.  I don't think I'd get it again.

The chocolate almond croissant was DELICIOUS!  Then I uncovered a short black curly hair that I couldn't come up with any alternative for besides originating from someone's lower pubic region.  

For the price they charge for their goods, I should be able to expect a hairless experience.  Even if it was a head hair or an eyelash I may have just brushed it off, no pun intended."}
{"text":"Sensations de goût frais, local & organique (Delicious fresh, local & organic taste sensations).  Even the eggs are beyond the normal simplicity of most restaurants. The eggs are always creamy, rich decadence. And the prices are amazingly reasonable & similar at other places with less quality. Your mouth just feel like you're in a 5 star in a casual, low key atmosphere. 

Chef Eugenia Theodospoulos utilizes \"only the freshest, most flavorful and environmentally friendly ingredients in their fine fare, believing that organic, local ingredients and farming methods are not only respectful of seasonal production schedules, but also help minimize both the emissions of dangerous greenhouse gases and the need for excessive, pollution-producing transportation.\"*

Chef Eugenia Theodospoulos is hands on even in the front bagging to go orders when they are busy. She definitely takes pride with a genuine smile in her bakery/dining establishment.  Definitely try their freshly baked breads & pastries."}
{"text":"The croissants are like true french croissants, each layer filled with buttery goodness. Sooo amazing like being in France. And the Chocolate croissant was heaven, the chocolate was warm and softened. The pecan sandies are delicious. The decor is cool with wisks used as light fixtures."}
{"text":"I almost hesitate to review as the more people that know about this the harder it will be to park....but this is really my favorite place to lunch in Arcadia. Love the salads, sandwiches and of course the macaron's are the bomb. We've also catered for corporate breakfasts and the food was superb. They have a small dining room as well, which looks like it would be really great for a group lunch or lunch meeting. 

Really the only downside here is the limited parking."}
{"text":"Probably the best macaroons I had ever had in my like, even better than France. Pick a flavor and that is what you are going to taste. Highly recommend you visit this place! Will definitely come back to try their breakfast menu."}
{"text":"NOT IMPRESSED! We came to have a pastry with a coffee. I picked the pecan sticky bun, I said yes to have it warmed up. 
We sat down and my friend are his strawberry croissant and I was still waiting 5 mins later for my sticky bun. Latte still MIA! I finally asked at the counter and the girl had to check on it. I went to wash my hands (sticky bun) and came back and coffee still wasn't at the table. Finally the guy came and said he had many orders...OKAY...so 20 mins waiting for a latte! What makes it worse we drove awhile to get here cause of reviews! NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE...they totally blew the pastry with coffee experience I was looking forward to and never get to do! Pastries not good enough to get me back! WILL NOT BE GOING BACK!"}
{"text":"Needed over 3 dozen macaroons for a wedding very last minute. I am talking about in the next 16 hours, last minute. They were able to provide the right amount and was a very positive experience. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Went in for a baguette and after waiting in line was told they wouldn't have any Friday, Saturday or Sunday. WTH! A French bakery with no baguettes!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my visit here for several reasons. 

First of all, the coffee. I asked if I could not have as much syrup in my order of the signature caramel glace (I don't like overly sweet coffee). I was confused by her answer, but I remember her saying it was a pre-made mix and they couldnt adjust the sweetness to coffee ratio, but they could put more milk in there. Ok? I ordered an iced coffee, and I really didn't like it. It was watery and too bitter at the same time, which all comes down to the roast. 

Food - I instantly wanted to order their special (scrambled eggs with herbs, peppers, served with baguette and nutella and bacon). The special sounded SO delicious and it sounded like a huge plate of food, that I decided to share the plate. What came to our table was a tiny amount of eggs, about the size of an older iphone. Since it was the special I was expecting so much more than a tiny amount of unflavorable, unremarkable, un-wow food. 

Based on this experience, I won't be stopping in here again. Nothing wrong with the service or anything, but I expect the special to be, well, special!"}
{"text":"Whenever I go here, I can't leave without buying a french macaron. This place has a myriad of flavors, my favorite is raspberry. Then there are their buttery chocolate croissants, which are the best I've ever had. I believe these get sold out daily as I don't always see them on the counter, so come early if you want one. I normally go to the Tempe location, but finally got a chance to visit their Arcadia location, I have to admit I like this location more because its seems to be bigger and more open, but parking can be an issue since the place gets extremely busy during lunch."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic - great vibe, great staff and sinfully good looking case of sweets!  We came in for breakfast on the weekend and ordered some egg dishes...they were just ok, but I know I will be back for the sweets in the case.  That is clearly where the goodness lies."}
{"text":"Amazing large macarons. They're a must-have here. There's adequate parking around back, and it's a great place for children. I always get their grilled cheese."}
{"text":"The pastries as divine, I had the almond croissant it was fantastic. I also had the lime macaroon - I could have eaten so many more! As far as the breakfast goes, I had the huevos Frenchos - this was really good. It was healthy, not a lot of grease, the eggs were well cooked, but nothing that will blow you away. The bacon was delicious."}
{"text":"I've already written a not so flattering review for the Tempe location and now, I'm sad to write an even worse review.

I've never been more disappointed with a macaron in my life. But we'll get back to that.

Inside is bright and clean with friendly employees. The parking is a nightmare. The back has a small lot with about dozen spots. An employee was standing outside \"working\" the traffic for the lot but he just stood there against the building. Unbelievable. I had to look for myself to see if there was a spot as when I asked, he said to go check. Okay, thanks for doing your job.

Order process was fast and simple. End of that. 

The brioche. What the heck happened to their brioche loaf? In Tempe location, it was fluffy and light and delicious but in Phoenix location, it was at least a day old, too eggy and dry. Their brioche was the best thing but wow. I hope the Tempe location hasn't change.

The macaron. Seriously?! The shell - too many air bubbles, cracked, uneven, hollow and spread too much. The filling - too runny and curdled. The filling is only in the center instead of spread out entirely. Majority of the flavor is supposed to come from the filling that soaks into the shell but when the filling is only in the center, the flavor can't spread. You get the filling in the middle but the rest of the macaron is just eating the shell. As a pastry chef, those are the shells that would have never seen the light of day. It is an insult to be served those inadequate macarons, let alone pay for it. Who cares if its big? It's just more flavorless shell to eat. I would rather have macarons from AJ's fine foods. I saw worse macarons in the case so I hope they never sell those to their customers. 

Absolute and utter disappointment."}
{"text":"Let me count the ways...

Friendly staff that obviously cares about their work. Nay... their craft. 

Nice atmosphere. Lovely food. Good coffee.

And the baked goods. Oh my the baked goods. You can not get a finer croissant or pastry in town. 

I'll miss the Tempe location, but the new one is a nice step up on the interior. 

Truly a must for any foodie in PHX."}
{"text":"Yum! The chocolate croissants and egg sandwiches are amazing. The prices are reasonable. And don't forget the macarons."}
{"text":"This place has macaroons!!! Enough said! Can't wait to go back! Also tried the French Toast Brioche and the Juevos Racheros, also very good! Service is a little slow but that's to be expected in a busier place."}
{"text":"3 words - Chocolate Almond Croissant. Not just chocolate, not just almond but BOTH! Together in an unholy, delicious union! This made my morning a delight. 

I went back for lunch the same day and had a wonderful chicken pot pie. It's not the usual huge pot pie you might find in the freezer section; instead it's a smaller, lighter, flakier, tastier version. It's served with a very simple salad of greens lightly dressed with vinaigrette in the French manner.

I liked it because you don't leave feeling like you have a lead brick in your stomach. The best way I could describe it is - elegant comfort food. Now go get one of those croissants! 

Note - they are closed on Mondays. Those days I have to make do with a cardboard protein bar. Sigh."}
{"text":"Incredible pastries! Our breakfast club tried a bunch and our favorites were the chocolate croissant and the fruit Danish. The macaroons were to die for! Breakfast was good, I had the French scrambled eggs with the baguette toast and home made jam. The women's restroom was gross and needed a good cleaning. Soap was dispensed out of a plastic ketchup/mustard bottle. That was weird."}
{"text":"Cute spot for a quick breakfast. Not a big menu, but everything I order is always good. 

Highlights:
Macarons- caramel, chocolate
Coffee, lattes
Puff pastry breakfast dish"}
{"text":"The Huevos Frenchos was excellent! I don't know how they can get the scrambled eggs to be so light, fluffy, and creamy, but they were delicious. We took home a plain and chocolate filled croissants for my daughter, who is particular, and she ate both!  The owner is friendly and personable, and visited a few moments, making us feel welcome."}
{"text":"Almond claw bar is the BEST I've had in Phoenix. Great friendly environment to have some coffee and relax."}
{"text":"So nice to finally have an Essence nearby!  Love their French toast with the banana caramel sauce!"}
{"text":"The absolute BEST pastry and fresh, hand-made food you will find outside of Paris! Have been a patron & fan of all foods Essences for years; from Tempe location to E. Indian School Rd. No one puts more thought into sourcing ingredients or skill into the preparation than Chef Eugenia Theodosopoulos. Give yourself a treat & indulge your palate at Essence."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. I love the food and the feeling of this place. I literally come in right before closing because im lazy on Saturdsys and buy a loaf of bread, usually the daily special or french scrambled eggs, coffee, iced tea and a baked good because treat yo' self. If I'm the last customer of the day, I can't imagine what the first customer gets to experience."}
{"text":"A great cafe that offers a sleek setting for some fresh eats, but it is the pastries that justify a trip across town.  Owner/Baker Eugenia Theodosopoulos and her French training is much appreciated and we relish being able to get a world class macaroon without having to put up with French snobbery."}
{"text":"I stopped in before having my hair done with a girlfriend at a her friends salon in her home nearby! I thought it would be a great excuse to stop in and take some along with me to accompany the wine! I purchased the chocolate and plain croissants! They were well received and delicious!! I wanted to purchase more goodies from the case...next time for sure!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots! Great vegetarian options. Their caramel macaroon is the best!"}
{"text":"Honestly my favorite breakfast place in the area. 

I live in the area, so have lots of good places to eat around me at all times. This is my favorite! Consistently delicious, and quality food you can feel was made with love. Plus, as a coffee snob I always stop to get coffee before or after wherever I eat. At essence I can enjoy their coffee bar, get my fix, and have a great meal all in one stop. 

I don't get the baked goods often but when I do they've always been fantastic!"}
{"text":"Beautiful, fresh food with great preparation and friendly service in cute decor - pricey for the portion size, though.

My favorite breakfast buddy and I really enjoyed the wonderful food,  beverages and atmosphere at Essence Bakery.  You order at the counter and then sit down with a number and await your food/drinks.  

The huevos Frenchos are really creamy and tasty, the salsa adds tangy flavor and the avocado is fresh. And my friend's breakfast sandwich was delicious, too! The only drawback is that the portions are really small, but the prices aren't proportionate.

We'll probably be back - we love to sit and chat (and not having a server makes it easier to hang out guilt-free). Plus, the food is nice, and we haven't tried the pastries, yet."}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this place after seeing it on AZ Highways. My wife loved the chocolate croissants that she had in Paris and this place is suppose to be just as good. When we went to order our food on the afternoon of March 20, 2015 the guy working behind the counter took a phone order after he just helped an elderly couple. Then he took another phone call, so I got in the other line that had two other people in it. Within a minute or two he came to the counter and helped the people in front of me. I placed my order and the girl behind the counter helping me seemed not to happy to be there.  I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and my wife had the Jalapeno sandwich. The chicken salad was very bland, but the Jalapeno sandwich was great and the potato salad. While we were eating the guy was very pleasant to a group of three females who happen to be white, but didn't seem as enthusiastic when he served a black female her food. I thought maybe it is just me, but my wife is Asian and after we ate, we got in line again to get some croissants and macaroons to go and the guy was behind the counter and didn't approach it until after we were being helped by the girl who wasn't trying to be pleasant. That person that he helped was another white woman and he was very nice to her. Maybe that was a coincidence? My wife didn't feel that way and felt discriminated. I did notice nobody put any tips in their jars. 

To bad, the food was good except for the chicken salad, but we will not go back because of the service we received!"}
{"text":"Fresh Flavors

We were thoroughly happy with the choices we made, all of the dishes were packed with flavour and an innovative flare. The atmosphere is pretty cool, nice and clean with a modern meets vintage feel."}
{"text":"Came in here for breakfast on a Sunday morning and the first thing that caught my eye was the super cool decor of this restaurant. I was really diggin it. Got their breakfast sandwich with Dubliner cheese on a fresh baked brioche bun which was really good. My wife got somewhat of an omelette/egg dish which was very unique but flavorful. Great coffee and overall just really cool place. I would love to come back and try some of their other pastries and sweet items as well."}
{"text":"Essence Bakery Cafe is THE REAL DEAL. I have no better way to describe this cafe which has been one of my favorite places, if not my #1 favorite, for over six years. The quality is consistently amazing. You can taste the passion the chef, Eugenia, has for the highest level of delicious, casual cuisine. She studied in Paris and is truly a local treasure.

Of course, the macarons....oh my goodness. I don't like caramel but I can't even keep the delicious caramel cream macarons out of my face. I seriously counted the days until they opened the Phoenix location and I haven't been disappointed. I've been the new location about seven times and have had good service every time. 

The coffee is very dark, which I love. The decaf iced tea is delicious. The Local Power Ranch hamburger with arugula, balsamic mayonnaise and Dubliner Cheddar is very good. Get it with the greens if you want to taste the most delectable spinach and frisee salad simply dressed with a vinaigrette. 

I don't even know where they get produce of the quality they do - the thick slice of tomato on the burger was so perfect - like the ones we used to eat 30 years ago that I thought were bred out of existence.

Every time someone comes into town to visit we take them here and they love it.

Even the decor is perfect. The modern, clean lines allow the diner to feel at ease and peaceful so that the experience revolves around the food - the simple but delicious tastes of real, quality food, perfectly paired.

FANTASTIQUE!"}
{"text":"Great bakery with some tasty pastries. It's a great stop for breakfast. I also had a giant macaron which was not filled with buttercream, but with something lighter. It was very yum."}
{"text":"Tasty brunch special.  A friend recommended Essence so we made the 38 mile drive (one-way). We'd come back again. Note: additional parking in the back."}
{"text":"Just visiting from Big Island and had read about Essence before the trip, so had it on our list.  The Signature Turnover with Eggs was delightful for an early breakfast.  Excellent blend of flavors and light crust.  Couldn't leave without splitting a chocolate almond croissant.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever! I got the French toast with fresh fruit and it so light and delicious. The chocolate croissant is also so good. Service is pretty fast and everyone is nice and it's so clean inside. Whenever I travel to Arizona I love coming here. If I lived here, I'd be going every week! Also, the vanilla macaroon is the best macaroon I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Simple concept serving house made croissants, Danish etc. this is a dying bread to make these items from scratch. Looking to cost $4-8/each but worth it for such a hand crafted product. 

Hot breakfast available as well and is equally delicious. Have the French scramble add their pepper thick cut bacon. Do it!"}
{"text":"I always trust a trendy spot when it manages to bring in the age 60+ crew. Great food, excellent coffee. No substitutions, kinda pricey and long ticket times - but ya know, they're French eggs. So chic like that. If it's Fat-ur-day, get the puff pastry sausage bfast. It's worth the gluten, I promise."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. Ordered the chicken pot pie and it was great. It comes with a salad"}
{"text":"I had the classic egg sandwich with bacon. I also hade a side of the fingerling potatoes. I think there is better hot sandwiches on the menu, I'll order one of those next time. Although a little over priced the quality is tasted. I also ordered a tea. Those three things were $17... pricey for a breakfast sandwich. Like the restaurant too it's nice and cool."}
{"text":"went back a second time...had the pot pie again. It was NOT as good as the first one...way to many peas and did not steam with each bite. I think they have a problem with quality control...the salad dressing not as good either...kind of disappointed overall...the cost is in line with the quality but there needs to be consistency of ingredients and end product."}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwich I've had in as long as I can remember: organic egg, crisp bacon, buttered homemade brioche that melts in your mouth! And real hot chocolate, like velvet!"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix and ate breakfast here! 
It was delicious. Very high quality fresh ingredients. I had the quiche. YUMMY!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a \"Light\" choice for a breakfast, this is definately not the place. The french pastries on display looked fab, but we went with the more traditional 'hot breakfast' menu - specifically the Egg Sandwich and Huevos Frenchos. 

While the food wasn't bad, it was overwelmingly buttery [and heavy with a half an avocado on each dish] and just not what we were looking for or really expecting. A pet peeve of ours, hubby and I both experienced 'staight out of the fridge' condiments and salsa which were served with hot eggs and barely warm potatoes. Service was slow and coffee only ok...I am sure the Bakery offerings are what really helps make this a popular morning 'destination'.

WIth so many other strong breakfast choices within a mile, The Henry, La Grande, Matts Breakfast Place, Chestnut etc, it is unlikely we will be back. :("}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for macarons. I have yet to find another place in the Phoenix area that does them as well as Essence.  A great variety of flavors and always so fresh! I do wish that they were open a bit later because in all honesty I would probably stop by on my way home from work at least a few times a week."}
{"text":"I'll admit I'm a breakfast snob and am a bit picky when it comes to my favorite meal of the day.  Today was daddy-daughter date breakfast and my 11 year old is pickier about breakfast  than me.

We both loved the Huevos Frenchos!  I substituted the mashed potato cake and she added sausage.  Service was good. Price fair to high. I'm willing to pay fr a great meal.

The pastry case looks amazing...we'll have to try it on our next breakfast date.  Off to school!"}
{"text":"Super solid lunch spot. Really cute atmosphere. I didn't partake in any macaroons or pastry this time but my coworker had to wipe drool off of my face while we were waiting in line to order. I will be back to swoop some sweet delights very soon. 

I ordered the Mediterranean platter which included dolmades (which I thought were a teense too oily), hummus (nice texture, not overly whipped, still had a slight chunk which I enjoyed), a lovely chopped Greek salad, and heavenly toasted and lightly buttered Baguette. It was very good -- great portion size and no overwhelming feta flavors which can be my main complaint with Mediterranean/Greek food. I wanted a bit more garlic in each offering but overall great dish , I didn't leave any on my plate. 

Now let's talk bread -- I'm thinking the next time I come back, I'm ordering the 18 inch baguette sliced in half, toasted and buttered. Not even kidding. I love bread and this bread made my inner fat kid squeal with delight. 

My coworkers ordered the mini grilled cheese & pear salad, the caprese sandwich, a quiche, and some sort of veggie salad. Everyone was very satisfied with their entree selections and I'm game planning my next visit."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised.  The breakfast entrees were good and filling.  The employees working at the counter and circulating in the seating areas were all very nice and helpful.  I was a little disappointed that they had run out of cheese croissants but 8:30am...  We got a box of the mini-macarons and have been enjoying them this afternoon.  Overall though I would recommend you at least give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I was hoping for more.  I really was.  I just got back - this is my fourth time there, always for breakfast/pastries, always willing to drop more money than usual.  If you're not a fan of reading a story, let me just sum it up:  go to Starbucks instead.

From a visual aesthetics perspective, it's not too shabby.  The place has a little bit of curb appeal, an unusually large mixer that's clearly for display purposes, and a semi-minimalistic kitschy interior.  Okay, this might not be bad...

But then you see the line.  It's sort of a cluster of people standing around the front, with a theme that implies the line starts near the door, sort of.  At 7:30AM, the crowd made me want to stand in line to get OUT of the place, not in.

Nonetheless, I made my way to order.  I was glad to see some breakfast items that I could relate to, and ultimately decided on something I wouldn't make at home: quiche lorraine.  I was promised it was \"amazing\".  It wasn't.  Now, take a 21 min intermission, because that's how long it took to get my food (yes, it took so long I started to pay attention to it).

First, let me just say that I know what a microwaved pastry tastes like.  Been there, done that.  This was more of the same.  If something is warm on the edges, but cold in the middle, consider the microwave.  F*ck, that was a waste of time and money.  I would ask for them to heat it up, but alas, look at that damn line.  My friend, who was having the french scrambled eggs, told me that it was nothing amazing.  Pretty basic.  So I had a bad experience and he had an \"acceptable\" experience.  Score: 3/5

On another trip, I lucked out, because there wasn't a line.  It's like the clouds parted and there was an open register.  I walked up, ordered some huevos frenchos, and took my seat.  Cue a 16 minute wait - hey, they're improving.  This time around, my food was decent.  I couldn't complain.  Taking advantage of the lack of line, I went back up and asked if they had coffee.  The kind gentleman gave me a cup, pointed to the coffee jug, and said \"$2.26\".  Wow, at least in Starbucks they'll fill the cup up for me at that price.

That's the recurring theme here on the food.  Moderately (not severely) expensive, with products that don't seem to match that expectation.  Now, I must say, ALL the pastries that I have tried, especially the macaroons, are delicious.  However, even the cost of a macaroon is more expensive here in Phoenix than the macaroons at Bouchon, a Thomas Fuckin' Keller creation.  This places charges considerably more and isn't even on par.  Yikes.  Funny part is, that complaint about the macaroons is really about 65 cents.  Oh well, I digress to digest.  I'll save my parking rant, whatthehelldoyouhavetodrink? rant, and more for some other time."}
{"text":"Sunday breakfast was great, especially the quiche and pastries!  Parking is a little tight if you arrive during peak hours; however, by the time we left, a number of spaces were open."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. The special salad was flavorless and dry. Ate 3 bites only. Staff asked how it was and I told them it had no flavor and was so dry I couldn't eat it. Was told they would let the chef know and to have a nice day. I like this place usually so am disappointed.
The dessert was stellar. Everyone has an off day so I will try again because I love their macacon"}
{"text":"YUM...  My first time here!  I loved it.  I got the French scrambled eggs with sausage and baguette.  Everything was GOOD!  The green ice tea was good and better cold.   The ice machine was out of ice.  It took them about 15 to 20 mins to get more ice into the machine.  The chocolate croissant was super good.  Got 4 macaroons and I inhaled them at home.  YUM........................."}
{"text":"We are regular visitors for years at the Essence in Tempe and we love it! We love their Chocolate Croissants! Fluffy light with soft chocolate inside. They are usually in a basket on top of the counter or fresh and warm inside right off the rack. 

We are in Phoenix so we were happy to have one closer to us. The place is cute inside. We ordered our Chocolate Croissants, and well, they were cold part way in, we typically love to pull off the flaky crust and go to the layers underneath, it was cold, and the chocolate was stiff, Are they refrigerated? Ive just never had one like this at the other place. So it really didnt have the same experience as thats what we go there for. Hope they get things ironed out, otherwise stick with the Tempe one! Theirs are delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been here for pastries, breakfast and lunch and I have not been disappointed.  Although I have read reviews criticizing the service, I have only had positive experiences with the staff and owner.  The bread and pastries compare to NYC and there is much love in the preparation of the food.  I highly recommend the classic egg sandwich, the egg salad sandwich (don't skip the bacon), baguette (best I have had in Arizona) and any type of croissant."}
{"text":"Once you get past the fabulous design of this space (beautiful yet warm & inviting), you'll find some delicious food! The pastries (and any sandwich that comes on croissant) are falky buttery bliss! Egg dishes are delightful, both breakfasts and the egg salad sandwich. Love the macarons!"}
{"text":"BEST MACARONS ON THE ENTIRE PLANET!!!  Strawberry, Vanilla and caramel are my go to!  If you think someone makes them better than you obviously haven't had these yet!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best macarons in scottsdale. The mint chocolate chip and raspberry were a hit and I liked that they have mini macrons and large macrons. A double plus theyre right next to seed cafe. A dragon slayer smothie and macarons is a must try."}
{"text":"When our eggs came cooked incorrectly they were very accommodating. The wait staff brought complimentary chocolate croissants while they fixed the mistake. The food came back good and hot. I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Essence Bakery and finally, I came with a friend of mine. After a tough spinning class, we felt like we deserved \"bad, but delicious\" food... I know, stupid - The best way to blow a workout!

Anyway, there's plenty of parking in the back and when we walked in, the café is pretty roomy. We scrutinized the menu a little bit and I finally decided on an iced vanilla latte with non-fat milk. They didn't offer coconut or almond milk, which is a bummer. The flavor wasn't bad, but not the best.

I also ordered the Lorraine quiche. It came with a side of fruit and the fruit was fresh and tasty. The quiche was ok. I've had better quiches.

I also decided to order a dozen mini macaroons to take home and indulge in later. Every time I start feeling sorry for myself, I'll just pop a macaroon in my mouth to make myself feel better (that's the plan). I just had two - the raspberry one and the espresso one. They were pretty damn good and yes, I already felt sorry for myself twice since I left the café! 
Don't judge!!!"}
{"text":"One thing I never will understand about Phoenix is all of the restaurants serving \"fresh\" food that is already made in advance. This is another one of those places.   I have food allergies. If you do as well I suggest you avoid this because they will not accommodate you. I tried to order the daily special sandwich without apricot. Nope, they can't do a special order because it's pre-made.  The ham sandwich without jalapeños? Nope, pre-made.  The grilled cheese without tomato? Surely they can grab 2 slices of bread, a slice of cheese, and then throw it on a grill? Nope, pre-made!   To me, this is absolutely bonkers that they can't, or refuse to, grab a piece of bread and throw a piece of cheese on it. I've heard wonderful things about the food quality, the excellent customer service, and fresh ingredients. I was clearly lied to."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars for cuteness and food and 1 star for coffee, price, and dog friendliness. Let me explain. The place is super cute inside and they have a wonderful menu. I started with a cup of coffee. Super disappointed. It was warm not hot and it had that bad acidic tang to it. I tried putting almond milk in it and it broke apart, my pet peeve is coffee places not using barista almond or soy milk. Then the food came. I ordered the special. Squash blossom omelette with a ham steak. It was amazing! Eggs were perfectly done. Ham was delicious. They were able to carry to my annoying gluten and dairy diet restrictions. Unfortunately, the breakfast cost me almost $20. I may be back for the yummy food but will go elsewhere for coffee. I really wish they had outside seating up front or out back. Bummer to be living in the neighborhood and not be able to walk to breakfast with the dog. 

...went back to give it another chance. Spent $20 for egg breakfast special with bacon and a latte...for one person. Food is still yummy...coffee still tastes like dirt. What a shame. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This rating is based solely on their granola.... it's the best!!  We wanted to buy 10 bags of it but alas, they only had one left at 2pm.   Look forward to returning to have breakfast there... liked the ambiance and friendly service and fact they have beer and wine, too."}
{"text":"This is not your run of the mill coffee and pastry shop. The menu is suited for the epicurean, but has also more basic items with gourmet twists (like the \"big breakfast\" that comes with mashed potato cake and sautéed mushrooms). There is a full selection of coffee and espresso drinks. The coffee comes in warm (!) cups! I had the granola with dates and yogurt, and fell in love with the granola. There are plenty of vegetarian options, and an added bonus is that many of the ingredients are sourced locally. 

Finally, the chef/ owner was behind the counter greeting customers and taking orders. The service was quick and friendly, and the atmosphere was comfortable (sort of industrial kitchen with some cute touches and big windows). I will definitely be back, and hope to try some pastries next time!"}
{"text":"Peg and I have been enjoying this wonderful experience for years....and I realized only a short time ago that I had never Yelped it!  Since Chef Eugenia and husband/partner Gilles opened a second location in the Arcadia district, we have been fortunate enough to visit fairly regularly....and the quality has never wavered. While the macarons have always gotten well-deserved attention, I always look for the people and service factor. The Chef has an infectious smile and laugh, and it brightens up the day when  you walk into the place. Of course, the food is as amazing as has been reviewed elsewhere. The chocolate croissants are indeed shut-the-front-door good. The coffee (something that is almost as important to me as the ambiance) is stellar and consistently good. We met GIlles the last time we visited, and it is easy to see how well suited they are together not only in the food they serve but in the caring they have for each other.  This is a delightful stop and a great addition to the take-a-deep-breath, read-the-paper, and relax-for-a-bit location list!"}
{"text":"Total meh. Mediocre food, too long a wait-whole place reminded me of a snack bar at a gym or something."}
{"text":"The best macaroons I've ever had and they are my favorite pastry ever so that's saying something. The coffee is also very good. I really love the decor and showing off their old school pieces Industrial work and turning them into art I think that is very cool."}
{"text":"Food is OK at best, service is less than unsatisfactory.  The employees seem to lack a certain level of intelligence and communication skills.  All of the people working there seemed to have no idea of what was going on around them.  At a breakfast place, I wouldn't expect there to be a shortage of coffee for more than 15 minutes.. That happened. I originally ordered the special and while I was ordering they took the special off the wall.  I pointed out to the girl taking my order that she should check if they still have it.  She said they had to make the sauce and that it would be a \"little bit\".  I then asked her roughly how long time wise that would be and she came back and said \"they said it will be a little bit\".  Then I ordered the quiche Lorraine, it took forever to be delivered and when it got to the table it was so cold like it had been sitting in the fridge.  If you prepare your food and put it in the cooler, and then heat it for about 30 seconds, I'd imagine it wouldn't take 30 minutes to prepare.  I couldn't help but notice the special which was supposedly unavailable for \"a little bit\" being delivered to several groups of people who ordered shortly after me and still received there food before me.  If you eat here, your experience will be dismal and probably frustrating. I gave this review 1 star because the baguette was delicious, but if you want a teaspoon of self proclaimed \"homemade\" jam which is probably from Costco, you'll have to pay for it.  This is the first review I have ever written but it needed to be done.  Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Essence, Tempe for a long while but I'm not willing to drive across town for a Greek Caesar Salad (even if it is DIVINE)... so unfortunately, I haven't been able to enjoy Essence unless I'm in Tempe & then I make it a stern-point to stop by. 

Needless to say, I couldn't have been more excited about the new Phoenix location - which is 2 seconds from my house! I took my Mother-in-law, visiting from Sweden last week & we had a lovely lunch. We both ordered the Greek Caesar but ultimately should have split one salad between us because when our order came out we both received our own small mountain of Greek Caesar ! 

Long story short, my only complaint is receiving too much Greek Caesar!? This isn't even a complaint! Essence is FAB!

Thank you Essence! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing! I had the chicken pot pie and it was delicious! Also got the chocolate croissant and a macaroon! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been here several times already and I hope many more! I work down the street and I'm so glad I found this dainty place. 

The employees are so friendly! Very approachable. 
The grilled cheese with tomato and.. I forgot what the other greens in it is but I think it's spinach? Or kale? But it's so delicious! The bread is absolutely addicting! I've been ordering it with a side of potato salad, and man! That's mouth watering too! 

The macaroons are to die for. I've never tasted macaroons so moist before. Everywhere I go they taste funky and dry. My friend said the owner is a French lady or she lived in France or something and she brought back the secret ingredients! I would definitely order a caramel or vanilla bean rum macaroon every time I come here."}
{"text":"Yes always great authentic French pastries however this visit warranted a 'review'. I had the international flavor brunch 'special' that included organic squash blossoms pressed between house made corn tortilla and plenty of oaxaca cheese. It did not stop there, this quesadilla was topped with organic eggs scrambled (I got my requested egg whites instead) and warm pepper bacon (c photo). Temperature was perfect of all ingredients and a finely diced fresh house made salsa clinched it for me. Palate and nutritionally balanced brunch.
Get on their email list for weekly 'specials'!"}
{"text":"This place definitely caters to the macaron trend. They have two sizes in a wide variety of flavours and colours.  Since I don't really understand the draw of the macaron, I stuck to the regular pastry case. Tried the fruit tart, a chocolate eclair, a sort of caramel chocolate tart, and a slice of mille-feuille (Napoleon) along with a small iced coffee to go. 
All of the pastries seemed pretty fresh and were very well made. I wasn't too impressed with the flavour, though. Something that should have been quite decadent was sub-par. I wish I had gone with some of the warm pastry breads instead.
They also have breakfast and lunch, but we were here just for dessert. None of the drinks are listed on the menu which was odd. They also only had soy or skim milk on the bar for my coffee. 
The interior is very austere and modern with a really cool vintage power mixer in the corner, apparently the owner's own, but didn't seem very warm or inviting as I expect a bakery to be. This is a neighborhood in east Phoenix, not Manhattan.

Overall, a very meh experience. Usually a new business needs the wiggle room to grow into their own feet, but since Essence is already well established in their other location in Tempe, I have to just assume I'm not the target clientele and my experience is quite different from the regulars'."}
{"text":"I'll go out if my way to come here for the Rum Vanilla Bean macaroons and chocolate croissants, by far my favorite in town. Unfortunately there is no wi-fi here so I can't really sit and work while I have my coffee in the morning. The owner isn't as friendly and I've had her interrupt the person helping me while we're having a conversation. Food is great, service could be better."}
{"text":"Horrible, service was terrible the pasteries tasted like two day old batter that you left out on the counter. I wouldn't recommend this place it sucked and I can only give this one star but if I could I would give it zero never go here!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"45 minute wait for overpriced mediocre eggs and raw, soggy, french toast and it wasn't even busy. The people who were there all wore Lulu Lemon yoga pants and clearly didn't go to yoga by the looks of their hair and makeup. Not my crowd. Grabbed a few macaroons on the way out that were delicious, only reason I am giving 2 stars."}
{"text":"The very best pastries in Arizona -- maybe the world!  I love that they open daily now and early.  Theses bakers are artists and produce amazing products that my family and friends love to enjoy.  My only complaint is that they are located so far from me!  I wish they'd open another bakery in North Phoenix!  But, the drive past Camelback Mountain is always enjoyable.  Don't miss out on this gem of the Valley!"}
{"text":"Yelp said this place was good for working. WRONG. The place does not offer wifi WTF. Its 2018. They didn't tell me this until after I ordered my food. And it's hot in here. I don't honk the AC is on and it's 90 degrees outside.

Update: over 20 minutes passed (and not because I thought i was a long time, but I looked at the time stamp in my receipt).  Computer data does not lie.  I went up to the counter and asked for a refund, a manager came up to issue the refund and NOT ONCE did she APOLOGIZE for the food being late or give me a reason as to why it is now 23 minutes and the food is not out yet.  Did you not put it through?  Like what kind of customer service i this? and IT WAS NOT PACKED.  STAY AWAY from this place - I just went to the Henry - which is amazing, btw."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Essence bakery! Tried it for the first time today. The blueberry lemon brioche was amazing! The almond croissant was good, as well."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor, and go to Essence Bakery for some out of this world pastries!!  

I normally try to skip out on the sweets (no bueno for the waistline....but so good once it hits your lips!), however anytime I have a crazy sweets craving, Essence is the place I go. If you go in the morning, I highly recommend the Almond Chocolate Croissant.  It is seriously out of this world delicious, especially when it's fresh 1st thing in the morning.  

The other item I 100% recommend is trying any flavor of their macarons.  They are so light and fluffy yet packed full of flavor.  And if you can't decide on just one, you can buy mini macarons to try out a myriad of flavors.  Seriously, I'm salivating just thinking of them, they are that good!!

Two very enthusiastic thumbs (and belt notches) up for Essence! :)"}
{"text":"$15 plus tax for breakfast and it was only me!!!!!!! A breakfast sandwich and coffee.
This place is outrageously expensive. Why is has $$ is a mystery. I ordered a classic breakfast sandwich and requested is on a croissant and there was a $2.00 up charge! Two extremely small pieces of avocado was $.90. So an egg sandwich became $9.40. 

The individual pastries were slightly overpriced but very good.
The brewed coffe is extremely weak and no better then Circle K.

AND.......NO WiFi!!! AND louder then normal background music that was Annoying and not selected for a relaxing early morning breakfast. I really think the music is for the young staff not for ambience. 

With all this being said, the food was good."}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocre food with unfriendly staff who has superiority complex. I have gone in 4 times and have promised myself not to waste my money on any of their food items except for their pastries. Even those are over priced. Cake the size of a small muffin for $7.95! I am sure no one has that kind of money, but I just talked myself out of going back to Essence since I can always go to LGO!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best food of this kind in the Phoenix metro.  I've been to Europe on many occasions, and no one, I mean no one, beats the croissants here.  I've never had a bad meal here, and I've been many, many times.  Don't waste your time with inferior pastries at trendy places like LGO."}
{"text":"stoked they finally came down to my area, we have been a few times. can be busy but worth it! the big breakfast, which comes with a potato cake that is fantastic on its own, is my go-to. always make sure to grab some macaroons for later, as you WILL regret it if you don't"}
{"text":"RUDE, in all CAPS! When I arrived, the cashier was having difficulty figuring out how to work the register for the guy in front of me. I gave her the \"don't worry about it\" smile as running a register would be the last job I would want on this earth and I didn't want her to feel  anymore anxious than she already was, because the next customer (me) was getting ticked because of the wait. She figured it out, and a new girl stepped in to take her place and I ordered my eggs. The girl says, \"sorry, breakfast is over.\" Well, it still felt like breakfast time to me and I asked her \"what's your cut off time\" and she says, 10:30. I look at my i phone and it says, exactly, 10:31. Keeping in mind, I arrived at 10:20 and  was having a serious egg craving, I  ask, NICELY, \"could you ask them if they could make one more scrambled egg order (nothing fancy here) and an older woman, also behind the counter, jumps in, glares at me and says, NO! I have eaten here before, the food was excellent, HOWEVER, coming from a long line of successful entrepreneurs, I have this to say. Whoever owns this restaurant, may I suggest at your next morning meeting, that you instruct your employees on the basics of how to treat your customer, you know, the ones whom your business depends upon to stay up and running. I went down a few blocks to La Grande L'Orange, yes, it was packed and the parking was challenging but it was worth the hassle. The eggs were perfect, the employees, pleasant and friendly. The staff at Essence should make a field trip over there, with their \"How To\" notebook in hand, your TIP from this ex-customer."}
{"text":"The French Macaroons were so darn good!!! Definitely worth it. And the chocolate croissant was wonderfully crispy on the outside and so soft inside. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"This place is great! The macaroons are amazing. Everything is fresh and great quality. The service is good. Everyone was nice and welcoming. I had the lunch special and a macaroon."}
{"text":"I love coming to this local and very hip bakery. Don't get hung up on the word bakery thou; this place is so much more. The baked goods are heavenly but today I opted for a classic breakfast sandwich and large cappuccino. They use organic coffee and organic eggs. That right there says they care about their customers. The bacon was crisp and the cheese melted to perfection. Friendly staff and clean environment. I would recommend this place if you are in the arcadia area."}
{"text":"Such a cozy and welcoming environment. I usually dip in and get my bakery goodies to go, but I really love taking the time to sit and eat brunch here when I have time. If you're going to order a sandwich somewhere, you ought to at a place that makes their own fresh bread! Their original breakfast sandwich is so simple yet has a lot of flavor; their brioche is what makes it. But really, everything I've had here is good. I think the macarons are a little over priced at $3 each, BUT they are larger than normal. This will be my favorite brunch spot for many weekends to come."}
{"text":"The burger was good. The chicken pot pie was good. The napoleon cake and pudding were good although I can't justify the price tag on the pudding lol. Iced Chai tea was good but could have been a bit stronger in the Chai department."}
{"text":"This place is super cute and fun. I really enjoyed their baked goods the most - we had a chocolate and almond croissant and it was wonderful. We had a breakfast here as well and although it was good, it wasn't my favorite. I had the special of the day where it was a puff pastry stuffed with cream cheese, sweet peppers and asparagus. This was fantastic and would have been better if there was a meat in there(maybe sausage?) but having the peppered bacon on the side was just as good. I had a serious issue with the eggs. They are done in a french style, so I think they are baked. I had an issue with the texture and that's more of a personal thing than anything against the chef. They came off as runny as far as a scramble goes and it just didn't work for me. 

Fiance had something more basic with sausage and eggs and some toast (I think) and he seemed generally please with it. He has had lunch there before and says the lunch is far better than the breakfast. 

I had an iced coffee that wasn't that great, it was the caramel one and I think they used salted caramel - but ether way it was extremely bitter all while having an overly sweet after taste. I would not order this again. 

Like I said the baked goods were the best for that visit and I want to go back for lunch to get a newer experience. I would feel more comfortable leaving 3.5 stars however I will give them the benefit of not being able to."}
{"text":"I love the food here.  So fresh and well prepared.  The staff is always super friendly and helpful.  LOVE the coffee!  And the cool interior design is a plus as well."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now. I love the ambiance and music when I walk in. The food is amazing as well as their notorious macaroons...come to mama. The macaroons are so decadent and naughty but worth every morsel. The cappuccino is gorgeous upon arrival and delicious to the last drop. 

Only negative- No wifi. What the heck?? It's 2015...get wifi already :)"}
{"text":"Really a 4.5.  Have now been about a dozen times.  The highlights?  Vanilla latte is to die for as is the chocolate croissant.  Had an eggs Benedict on brioche on Sunday which was perfection.  Kitchen can be a little slow so I wouldn't go if you are in a hurry, and it is a meal to be savored not inhaled.  Parking is challenging as well.  Can't go too often or I would end up in a sugar coma."}
{"text":"The place is modern, light and clean. The coffee is wonderful, the counter service is friendly but a tad slow....but who is in a hurry on Sunday!
Excellent fresh food but the breakfast sandwich is a little on the small side (but I'm spoiled by Big Matts). I didn't go early so parking was fine.
My fellow diners' cereal, breakfasts and Eggs Benedict looked delicious."}
{"text":"Rarely do I consider breakfast to be amazing, but the sausage turnover and eggs at Essence is without parallel. The turnover pastry and the eggs were the best I've ever had of either. The fresh fruit wasn't your standard melon and pineapple, but had fresh berries, grapes, Apple, pineapple, and more."}
{"text":"I have been craving authentic Macarons ever since I got back from a summer trip to France, and Essence is the closest I've found yet! Today was my first visit, and I had the Raspberry Rose and Meyer Lemon. They were delicious and true to flavor. My Macarons were so good that I ordered three more to take home (Pistachio, Strawberry, and Mocha). I think their Macarons are reasonably priced. You get a much smaller size at AJ's for the same cost. I will be back to try their other pastries and breakfast soon. I just wish they served dinner too!"}
{"text":"There is no wifi, and there are no samples. But my lunch was good. I had the Jalapeño Croque-Monsieur and a side of French Dijon Potato. Both were tasty. The new location has plenty of room. There are both tables and bars for eating. Parking in the back wasn't a problem. I tried to order a birthday cake for my wife, but unfortunately, I waited too long - EB requires 48 hours for a special order."}
{"text":"What a wonderful bakery. 
We are new to the neighborhood and this has become a breakfast and lunch favorite."}
{"text":"Killer food!  Every time.  Huevos Frenchos, Big Breakfast, chocolate croissant, lunch, coffee... it's all good. Go there!"}
{"text":"After living in France for 5 months, I don't hesitate to say that these are truly the best macarons (not macaroons!) I've ever had. It'd be easy to boast about Parisian macarons that my friends here will never try, but I'll admit it: Essence does it best.

The staff is also extremely friendly here. Got a free cup of their delicious organic coffee :-)"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Macaroons are delish. Super into it. No substitutions rule: so French, so chic, so annoying."}
{"text":"Simply delicious. 

Simple, elegant, delicious dishes & baked goods. Coffee is great, portions are medium to small. Ambience inside the bakery is good, outside there is something left to be desired. 

Baked Goods = A
Coffee = A
Ambience = B
Pricing = B"}
{"text":"Ehhh... Sorry Essence, but you dropped the ball. 
We ordered a small OJ, 1 coffee, Huevos Frenchos, and a  Brunch Special (chocolate waffle w/ toasted hazelnuts and homemade creme). Total, $27. The eggs in the Huevos Frenchos were very softly scramled, and came with a small side of fingerling potatoes. I appreciate how delicately the chef handled making the eggs, they were clearly attended to! Although, they came out very cold which ruined it. The waffle had too much fudge, but were overall decent. The waffle itself was light and airy.

Pros:
- Aesthetically very clean and attractive
- Menu is creative and unique
- Service is friendly
- Good food presentation

Cons:
- Overpriced ($3.50 for 4 oz of Orange Juice) Folks, you can get away with these prices if the issues below didnt exist.
- Portions are small
- Food was cold
- Food is just average, nothing to write home about (Or rave on Yelp about)
- Slow Service. Took 10 minutes to get drinks, and over 30 minutes for food, and it was not overly busy. Yes, I did time it!

Final thought...I will not go back. I recomend trying it for yourself, but personally i will not pay those prices again at the risk of being highly unsatisfied. I think the chef has a good idea of what they're trying to accomplish, but they failed at execution. Hope you guys work out the kinks and succeed in the future! Maybe hire a good kitchen manager?"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to Essence for a while but just never made it. So glad we did. I have to say that it was better than I ever imagined. We went on Mother's Day around 10:30 and the line was out the door. I was surprised at how quickly the line moved. They had 2 registers open which really helped. Amazed at how organized and friendly every single staff member was.
I placed my order and was given a number. I had ordered some croissants, which I was dying to try and some macarons to go. We each had a croissant while we waited for our entrees. Oh my goodness, they are so light and flaky and buttery. We put a little of their jam on them, which they didn't even need. I seriously could've made a breakfast if just croissants. We got 6 of them to go and had them for a snack later in the day and the the next morning. I was a little hesitant about getting that many and how they would be the next day but I kept them in the wax bags they come in and reheated them in the oven at 300 degrees and they were perfect. Made some scrambled eggs and a green Chile sauce with some cilantro and cheese. Wow! Will always get a few extra croissants for the next day. 
Also got 6 macarons that I've heard so much about. Well they far exceeded my expectations as well. They're indescribable is all I can say. We had the strawberries and cream and the hazelnut. 
My entree was the  Quiche Lorraine which melted in your mouth. It truly was the best I've ever had. It came with a side dish of mixed fruit, which was perfect a perfect accompaniment. 
My husband had the breakfast special which was eggs Benedict with roasted fingerling potatoes. He shared a bite with me and it was fantastic! The ham they use is sliced paper thin and a little crispy on the edges. And the béchamel sauce was delicious!
We talked to a couple sitting next to us and they had ordered the big breakfast, they apparently eat there frequently. The big breakfast is 2 Organic Eggs served with a Mashed Potato Cake, Breakfast Sausage, Sautéed Mushrooms, and Homemade Buttered Toast with Jam. He said the mashed potato cake is their favorite thing of all. Now I'll have to go back to try that. They also have a very interesting lunch menu. Love the local and organic products they use. 
Essence exceeded my expectations, definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the ambiance of the new location! Food was great except that we found a piece of bacon in the fruit bowl. They apologized and gave us a new bowl, but the damage was done. We shared the french scrambled eggs, baguette, almond chocolate croissant, and fruit bowl. Everything tasted delicious but the portion of the baguette was really small for $3.50. Service was a bit slow but food was worth the wait."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but my first visit was disappointing. I got a iced coffee and ordered to go. The iced coffee was great and the person who rang me up was super nice and helpful. I ordered the huevos frenchos with bacon which sounded delicious. After 35 minutes (I came in at 11 so it was not busy at all) I finally got my food and left to eat at home. When I got home (I only live 2 minutes away) there was no bacon and the eggs were super cold. It was just flavorless potatoes and cold eggs so I ended up just making myself a breakfast with the potatoes and my owns eggs. I would have gone back but I never got a receipt and I was starving so I didn't want to go back and wait for a whole new meal. It was just disappointing I was super excited for a new breakfast place in my neighborhood. I used to work in restaurants so I know that employees don't pay attention to the details when it gets slow but simply printing a receipt would have helped me."}
{"text":"I'm a bit at a loss for words to describe how much I and my entire family love this place. This review is focused on their baked goods. The baguettes are crispy and tasty, just like in France, and their croissants and pains au chocolat, too. I especially like that they have two bars of chocolate in the pains au chocolat (it's basically a double pain au chocolat). You do have to be careful to time your visit, as sometimes they have not yet finished baking the bread, and there's no set time when you know for certain it will be done every morning (I'm talking about showing up around opening times fyi). Anyways, we always make a point to stop here and get these pastries for breakfast when we're in town. And the brioche is delicious, too! The owners are very friendly and great to talk with. Highly recommend. This is the best place for viennoiseries we've found, and we've been test tasting a bunch of places in LA, too! If only Essence were (also) in LA...we're still on the hunt for a place on par with their viennoiseries."}
{"text":"Pastries are a passion of mine. I have a sweet tooth in a mad way, and am always in search of quality baked goods. 

Essence has quality baked goodies. Everything is delicious and cannot be passed up. Whatever you do, get the almond croissant!"}
{"text":"This place is heaven for vegetarians and those that prefer gluten free foods. You definitely get your money's worth here. Essence has a Great atmosphere, great friendly staff to match as well. 
I got the chance to have a strawberry delight macaroons as well. So delish. I have no complaints!  :)"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place because of the Tempe location.

Tried the macarons, the chocolate seemed, well not. And the mint appeared burnt on the underside. Wonder why I was tasting something weird.

So, gave them a chance again with double chocolate cookie, tasted like brown sugar. I know if I don't have the right amount of sugar and chocolate, then the chocolate taste will be cancelled out. I might as well go to the store to pickup $3.95 brown sugar and eat it. Also I called ahead to reserve a small seasonal pie (and they really didn't care, it's like I never called), and it didn't get reserved but they just so happened to have the last one available. I'll just make the worthwhile trip to the Tempe location."}
{"text":"Quality is (mostly) present in the product, here. The baked goods and beverages are made well (for the most part). Unfortunately those alone aren't enough to merit a return visit from me or my friends. Where Essence falls short, and REALLY fell short today, is in the quality of service. I witnessed and absolute lack of communication and connection between the front of house staff. There were two males and one female, all of which failed to comminate with one another. Only one of them (the tall guy with the dark hair) had something that even remotely resembled a smile on their face or willingness to be helpful. One my beverages was made incorrectly and the other nearly wasn't made at all, until they finally realized they had forgotten about us. What I see here is a serious LACK OF TRAINING. Your FOH employees are the first impression when someone walks through the door and the last impression when someone leaves! If you want repeat business, training is key. Even with all the mistakes, proper customer service may have improved the experience. However, my girlfriends and I left unimpressed."}
{"text":"Overpriced and inconsistent food quality and service. We waited over 20 minutes for our lunch to go and received ice cold chicken pot pie. On past occasions, regularly burnt brioche buns on our sandwiches. Disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their macarons! The pistachio ones are my favorite!!! 
I hope they offer cooking classes at some point because I would love to be able to make them as well as they do!"}
{"text":"Essence has really, really good French-style pastries and good coffee/espressos. It would be 5 stars for these things. Their chocolate croissant (my litmus test for a good bakery) is the best I've found in the area. I also enjoy the light and airy ambiance. 

Unfortunately, I have been disappointed with the two breakfasts I have tried. The French eggs were so full of mustard seed they were difficult to eat, and the caramel sauce for the French toast was just not very good (though the brioche bread it was made out of was). I might try something for lunch soon, but when I am here for breakfast again I will stick with a chocolate croissant and latte."}
{"text":"Oh My God, Becky! Look at those raisin croissant!!!! Seriously, I am pretty damned snobby about food and especially fancy shmancy claims of being \"artisan\"' ugh, I despise that word. Essence chefs are not artisans, they're professionals. This is the real deal. As a recovering fat guy,  I am unsure if I can even return. The croissant is perfect. Light, buttery and fresh. The egg sandwich with avacado had the perfect bit of crisp edge, as if laser sculpted. Fresh perfectly sliced tomato, not too thin or thick. Did I mention the raisin croissant???? You've probably slipped and bumped your head if you do not stop there after reading this review. 5 stars indeed."}
{"text":"So happy to see Essence make it's way into my neck of the woods. I am kinda shocked at the rating so far, but maybe it has to do with a rough opening. I ordered the chicken club sandwich and it was everything I expected. I totally blew it though, stupid diet reasons made me pass on the macaroons. It's worth a trip to Essence just for those. I think once the staff is up to snuff this place will be as good as the Tempe location."}
{"text":"Local fun counter service bakery.  We drove by and decided to pop in for breakfast.  Big Breakfast was good but it really wasn't a big breakfast.  Had the tomato orzo soup and it was good.  Need to come back and try some baked goods!"}
{"text":"Who needs a bunch of blah, blah, blah...either you like it or you don't. What can I say...I liked everything about my visit and I'd recommend that you give it a try."}
{"text":"Normally everything I come here everything is amazing. Well not so much this time so mabye it was just an off day. I ordered 2 caramels macaroons, 1 pumkin spice and one expresso. The caramel macaroons were really hard and dry almost crunchy. It was hard and tuff kinda like chewing beef jerky.they have never lasted like this before, not sure what went wrong. Mabye cooked to long or a new Baker. I was really disappointed. The other two macaroons were prefect nice and soft with delicious flavor."}
{"text":"The macaroons are so delicious. I'm a fan of their coffee as well. It would be perfect if they had wifi and it's a bit pricey for a coffee shop but worth it for a coffee date with friends."}
{"text":"Best croissants delicious macaroons.  I'm addicted to the egg sandwich add avocado and the Jalepeno  croquet Monsieur sandwich.   I also love how staff does not mind if you sit for a while long after eating."}
{"text":"I went here only for the macarons. But based off how delicious they are I'd certainly come back to try other items!"}
{"text":"Good food, decently priced, cute atmosphere , TAKES FOREVER to get your food and the pastry's are extremely over priced! Friendly employees."}
{"text":"Greek. French. Delicious. The spinach pie is one of the best we've had outside of Greece. The pastries are creative and delicious. Great for breakfast, lunch or a mid-day coffee break. We've been back many dozens of times... usually Saturday mornings... and it's consistently great. Best coffee in town. And the quiche... light, airy and perfect."}
{"text":"Went and bought the lemon bar and the key lime bar and the cherry brownie all were excellent I am never disappointed with the bakery good service yummy baked goods"}
{"text":"We wanted to check out a new place and walked to Essence. Very friendly staff! However, the organic drip coffee was sub-par and granola was not edible. Compared to LGO the prices were very high. For a typical breakfast sandwich, two drip coffees and granola our bill was $26.00. Their baked goods looked amazing and apparently might have been a better choice."}
{"text":"In the years since Essence opened in Arcadia, we have been many times. Today we stopped for a quick lunch and had a fantastic butternut squash soup and the amazing chicken club sandwich.   I swear that chicken club is like every simple and clean sandwich you ever wanted. Like, is it homemade mayo?  And the most tender chicken ever.  And good tomatoes and nice bread and good bacon.  Ok, I'm done now.  It's just so good.  This is a favorite neighborhood spot and I'm so glad it's in my neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"We went to AJs to get some Macarons, and their bakery was closed due to construction so we drove over to Essence. It was such a cute little bakery. The Macarons are amazing! We got the minis and all the flavors were so good. The staff was very helpful, and the head baker even came out to say hello and make sure we were being helped. There were a few people with food & coffee working on laptops, a few people chatting.. super cute fun place."}
{"text":"It pains me to have to write this review.  However, 4 visits in the first week and no improvement, makes me think its management and not growing/new opening pains.

Were to start....I will start with the experience that actually motivated me to write this review followed by the experience I had today.  Essence claim to fame is the Macaroon, so naturally being able to walk in and get a macaroon or variety of macaroon is important (have to do at least your claim to fame really well)  So I stopped in Saturday (following Friday lunch were they ran out of cheese) to buy 10 mini macaroons.  I waited in line and then promptly ordered when it was my turn.  While ordering they looked in the case to see if they had what I ordered so I assumed that they would be pulling my macaroons out of the case.  So I then peered into the case and ordered what I saw was available.  I should have know something was wrong then because she was not grabbing and putting them in a bag.

Next after repeating my order (which I have had to do every single time I have gone in) she gives me a number and says it is for my coffee.  So I am standing there twiddling my thumbs watching everyone behind me get their pastries and macaroons and leave.  So I ask \"May I have my macaroons?\"  This is followed by that will be 5-10 minutes for your macaroons!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WTH are you kidding me, I just watched you give 5 people after me their macaroons.  Then one of the other women says \"Well it takes 5-10 minutes for special orders\"  DUDE YOU ARE A MACAROON STORE, ordering 10 mini macaroons is not a special order.  

Then this is now followed by \"Well they are making them in the back\"  followed by a sarcastic response from me, \"really they are making them in the back\"  \"YES\"  This is were I start to lose it.  There is nothing I HATE more than being LIED to.  I watched them dodge me and never go into the back to \"make them\" and proceed to pull them out of the very case I ordered them from.  I also watched a gentlemen come in and order 10 mini macaroons and get them right then, pay and walk out.  So I point this out to the women that told me they were being made in back and mine was a special order and she looks at me and goes \"OK\".  I get you are busy, but lying and being rude doesn't help the situation.  In fact to repeat myself I hate being lied to and why lie when the customer is standing there watching you not go in back and serve other people food.  

Brings me to today, I thought okay Emily, you are being way too hard on this bakery they just opened.  So my friend and I decide to go in for Brunch.  I ordered the turnover and got my food oddly fast.  Well that is because it was ICE COLD.  so I walked up with my plate and ask if they turnover was suppose to be served cold (never know) and she says no.  I so try to hand her my plate and she is looking at me like I am weird.  Then asks me to take my knife and fork and goes Ill heat it up......I reply \"are you going to nuke it\"??!?!?!?  She goes \"Ill ask for a new one\"  Almost like she was doing me a favor.  

Sit back down, wait FOREVER for the new turnover (definitely did not put a rush on the turnover)  New plate hot turnover come out, and now COLD eggs.  It was at that moment I gave up.  No apology, no free mini macaroon, in fact they could seem to care less that they are the problem, and not the customer.  I understand new openings, but with a new opening generally comes customer service.  Everyone is running around like they were not trained.  You have customers coming in ordering who have never been to your store and you cant even tell them what sodas you have or were they are located.  

If you are going to place your drinks around the corner, put a sign out informing your customers what beverages you serve.  Instead I tried to order a couple different things before they told me the drinks were in a case around the corner.

So to summarize, I find the staff rude, the service slow, uninformative. and food mediocre.  It will probably do well because it is in Arcadia, however this Arcadian who loves macaroon will not go back unless its because the other dining party wants to go and I will continue to drive to Classic Cake and Confections to get my macaroons at least they act like they appreciate my business."}
{"text":"My first time at this location.  I love Essence Bakery!  I ordered the Big Breakfast with my eggs scrambled and a baguette.  Oh that potato cake is stupid good. The Big Breakfast was wonderful.  I also could not pass up a chocolate croissant.  It was still warm.  Flaky and delicious.  I also had an iced caramel latte.  I also got 2 macrons for later.  A caramel and a strawberry.  Both were excellent!  Needless to say, I needed a to go box, and I felt kinda off the rest of the day since that was a lot of rich food, but what the heck, it's Essence Bakery, you just have to go for it!"}
{"text":"I think if I only went here for pastries and for tea, I would like it better. The food was not spectacular in my humble opinion. But the environment is nice.

I think also if I really liked French food, I would have a deeper appreciation of the food. It likely is more authentic than I am giving it credit for.

NOTE: I can't recall if I ever have eaten French food, but I eat Indian like 2x a week. So you might have to ignore my uncultured review. And sorry if I offend."}
{"text":"Great place with healthy options. I am a fan of the hot breakfast cereal with greek yogurt and fruit. Definitely another great addition to an already superb lineup in Arcadia."}
{"text":"I love this place. I met a buddy of mine T for breakfast during the week and seriously fell in love with Essence. The lovely young lady behind the counter was very nice. We placed our order at the counter after some playful banter with our host and sat down to catch up on our going on's and wait for our breakfast.
I ordered the Classic Egg Sandwich which included organic eggs, Dubliner Cheese, a beautiful slice of Tomato plus ham and Avocado on a Brioche bun ($7.35). The sandwich itself was a bit small even though the bun gives it a lot of height. And that makes it a bit hard to eat. However, everything tasted great and for $7.35 it's a decent deal. (Not as good as Morning Squeezes' Build Your own however).
T ordered a French Butter Croissant ($2.55) which we both enjoyed. This was a great Croissant. T and I discussed how difficult it can be to create a great Croissant and it seems that Essence has got it down.
T also ordered The Big Breakfast ($9.75). This comes with 2 Organic Eggs served with Mashed Potato Cake, Breakfast Sausage, Sautéed Mushrooms and Toast with Jam. T said his breakfast was very good and he thought the price was fair.
Once we were finished with our breakfast I picked up a Neapolitan to take home to K. She took it to work and made everyone jealous. She said it was phenomenal. Awesome. It seems that a lot of people like the Macarons and they were definitely available in a lot of flavors. But, both T and I agreed they looked a bit, how should I say, not the best. So we passed. 
Great space, great staff, good food, great Neapolitan, great available pastries, fair prices. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"The chocolate almond pastry was amazingly delicious. Probably the best pastry I've had in a really long time. The egg salad sandwich (with bacon) is better than the chicken salad sandwich but they are both very yummy and a good order if you're looking for a light lunch. The potato salad is mustard based, which I really enjoy. Maya was our server, she was very attentive and kind. The atmosphere is modern and hip yet inviting and warm. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"The French scrambled eggs are to die for. And so is everything else, basically. Best scrambled eggs I have ever had in my life, and best macaroons in town! I love the atmosphere, and Eugenia is always so friendly. Great for breakfast or a low key brunch with your boo on the weekend."}
{"text":"Best almond croissant I have ever had. They are serious about breads and croissants.

The breakfast sandwich is at once light and filling, the dining area is spaced well, everything is clean and orderly and the atmosphere is modern without being cold. 

Love the hum of refrigeration under some light music and poured concrete floors."}
{"text":"Delectable goodness!
My bf surprised me with macaroons this morning and I squeeled with joy. I've been wanting to try this place for months and happy to be able to devour them this morning. The vanilla bean is my absolute favorite. Wow wow wow! 
I'm officially now in trouble since this place is on my way to work. I will be stopping in for a treat many more times than I should."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review, it really does. I really wanted to like this place, I've heard amazing things about the Tempe location (which unfortunately I haven't been to) and was excited that there was a location nearby to visit. The location itself is really cute. It kind of reminds me of NCounter in Tempe. 

Positives: 
-It's a really cute cafe. The decor is kitschy and cute, with a huge mixer in the front. I like the overall minimalist design.
-I like the fact that you order at the counter, even though in a large group it can be a little annoying to have food come out in rounds. 
-I can see why people come here, for the baked goods. I got a chocolate croissant to share with my group and everyone agreed it was delicious. 
-The food was pretty delicious. I tried a bite of my boyfriend's french toast and the banana caramel sauce is to die for.

Onto the unfortunate negatives:

Issue #1: The staff was inconsistent. Either they were overly friendly & attentive or couldn't be bothered. Case in point-The lady who took my order was very friendly & peppy. She was very helpful at offering suggestions and even up sold me on getting a pastry to share with my group while we waited for our food. Once we got our food, it was difficult to flag any of the staff down if we needed anything and if we were successful-it took an awfully long time to get what we asked for. 

Issue #2: My friend and I ordered the exact same dish but got different amounts of food. My friend noted that she felt it was overpriced for what she was getting, but then was kind of upset to see that my order had way more potatoes than hers did. There should be a standard there, especially if it's pretty obvious we're at the same table?

Issue #3: The amount of time it took for our food to arrive. I understand if you're like crazy busy, but it was only moderate on our visit. Each of us pretty much ate our entire meal before the next person got their food. I understand we ordered separately but the timing was pretty close between orders. 

Perhaps this place is experiencing growing pains? I don't know. I'd like to make a return visit, but I will probably wait a bit. Hopefully I can update this review with more stars."}
{"text":"Came here for a meeting breakfast and ordered the Huevos Frenchs -- French Style Scrambled Organic Eggs Topped with Avocado and Fresh Tomato Salsa, Served with Roasted Fingerling Potatoes and added Bacon. Really satisfying combination!"}
{"text":"The mini macaroons at $1.40 a piece are worth every penny! 1 is all you need. My fiance was rolling his eyes at me when I insisted that we pay $3 for 2 bite size salted caramel cookies. And then he put it in his mouth. Wait for it....wait for it....BAM! I love it when I'm right :) 2 hours later he was still thinking about that cookie & said he wished we would have splurged and gotten the big ones. 

They are new to the neighborhood. I read a couple of reviews that indicated they may not have gotten their sea legs yet. Give them a chance. We stopped in because I'd been hearing some buzz about those delicious little cookies. Didn't have time to stay for lunch, but the menu sounded so good I thought about grabbing something to go. We'll definitely go back to check it out."}
{"text":"My visit here almost doesn't count.... I came in (too) late on a weekend afternoon looking for a chocolate croissant....all sold out. I should've seen that coming. I ended up getting a couple macarons instead, a hazelnut and a caramel.... I have a love hate relationship with macarons....sometimes they're overly chewy which I don't love, and other times they are light little bites of airy deliciousness.... Today I had one of each. The hazelnut was just, ok but the caramel was amazing! I definitely need to make it back for that chocolate croissant....oh, and the food."}
{"text":"Updated Review: based on my experience of the weekend where I was missing items from my takeout order, I was very pleased with the outcome of my conversation with management. It was sincere and apologetic. Based on that, I will give this place the five star it deserves. The quality of food is amazing and it's nice to see ownership out in the lobby talking to the customer. Something that more local businesses should do in the Valley. I can only think of two other places where ownership goes out of their way to welcome customers. The sausage turnover and croissants are amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a clean little place with very friendly customer service people. We had a lovely breakfast there and the pastries are hard to resist they look so good. It is close to all that is Arcadia and is a great addition to the hood we enjoyed the chow and it's close enough for a nice bike ride even better. If you are not into that they have someone to valet your ride but it's worth checking out no matter how you get there."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, great food and top notch macaroons. Order at the counter and they deliver it to your table. I went here for a lunch meeting, it wasn't too busy and the food came out quick. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is unreal. The breakfast was amazing from the Eggs to the potatoes to the jam. It's 100% on my list to come back to."}
{"text":"Met a friend there for some breakfast. I'm not usually a big fan of bakery type places but this was excellent. You order at the counter. The decor is modern and minimalist. A very nice environment. I had \"The Big Breakfast.\" 2 eggs, mashed potato cake, sausage, mushrooms, and a baguette. Everything was perfect. The eggs were cooked perfectly(over medium), the sausage tasty, the potatoes were well made and finally the mushrooms were perfectly sautéed. I like things simple and well made. Each item was perfectly prepared and they all complimented each other nicely. Finally their Nicaraguan Organic coffee is smooth and strong. No hints of corporate coffee here. Seriously good breakfast. I can't wait to head back and try something else."}
{"text":"Came in the other day and got an assortment of croissants. Overall I was so pleased with the assortment we got and everyone else enjoyed as well. The hands down favorite was the almond/ chocolate almond croissants, the hint of what I assume to be lemon was amazing and made the flavor exceptional (so much so that for our next gathering we are doing double the amount of the almond croissants). The pistachio croissant was a bit disappointing as we hoped there would be more flavor there. It was still a good croissant though! Overall we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood alternative to LgoNo! Pkg not bad in am & owner actually nice & makes you feel like you're in Europe! Recommended..."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome menu. Drawback is the price is about 15-20% higher than it should be for what you get. It's good food, don't get me wrong there, but it's overpriced. The baked tomato is really delicious."}
{"text":"We live close by and have passed this place 100x! My partner and I decided to try Essence. All we can say is \"wow\"!  We had the quiche and split one the incredible pastries. The quiche was perfect, the pastry buttery flakes with just the perfect amount chocolate.....They have a \"pastry\" special.  This will be one of our special \"take out of town visitors\" to eating places....
Wonderful customer service. We we arrived early on Sat morning by the time we were leaving the line to order had grown....so the early bird catches the worm or in this case the wonderful pastry and quiche!! 6 Stars!"}
{"text":"I adore this bakery. I googled best croissant in PHX and that search led me here. I parked in back in what must be the most beautiful parking lot ever, and got a chocolate croissant, and a chocolate almond croissant. They were both simply Devine. I also got a lemon macaroon that was the best I've had hands down. Try this place and love it like I did!"}
{"text":"Heavenly scent of fresh-baked croissants and goodies await as you enter this darling establishment. The food here is every bit as good (and seems better) than the Tempe location. How can that be?? I love the uniquely oversized lime green mixer as you enter Essence. I had a delicious arugula salad with dates and crispy pepper bacon and a luscious cheese croissant. My friend had the homestyle ham and bean soup with grilled cheese sammie. The macarons - what else is there to say? Delish! Please never leave us Essence!!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Any place that makes fresh macarons is a hit with me but Essence is the whole package for lunch. We had the quiche Lorraine with a fruit side. I can't stand when the fruit sides are all soggy cantaloupe but this side was fresh raspberries, bananas, and pineapple. Perfect! And yes the quiche was delicious. We also had the lunch special which was moussaka- it was perfection! What a wonderful blend of flavors. Of course we had macarons to go- the best in town!"}
{"text":"We used to live near the Essence location in Tempe and went there almost every Saturday for brunch. Needless to say, we were sad to move away from the neighborhood. (I even stayed on the Essence mailing list because we liked it so much!) So, we were thrilled when Essence decided to open a second location in our new neighborhood.

We have been to the Arcadia location several times since it opened, both during the week and on weekends. I strongly prefer this location to the Tempe one because it has the same good food and desserts but a lot more space. (The Tempe location always felt cramped, especially during rush times.) I have not been to the Tempe location in a while (so things may have changed there too), but I  appreciate that the Arcadia location has longer brunch hours, is open on Sundays, has a more diversified menu, and offers larger portion sizes.

Some of our breakfast favorites include: the sausage turnover, the \"big breakfast,\" and the french toast. Lunch favorites include: the chicken pot pie, the burger, and the quiche lorraine. The daily specials are usually really good as well. For desserts, you can't go wrong with a caramel macaroon. 

I know that other reviewers have run into difficulties with parking at this location. I have never had that problem here, but maybe I've been lucky. I also have not had problems with long wait times (though I have had this problem a few times at the Tempe spot)."}
{"text":"Their macaroons are amazing.  My favorite is the good ole' vanilla flavored macaroon.  They are so chewy and full of flavor.  I also tried a breakfast croissant sandwich once and enjoyed it as well.  But my main reason for ever stopping here is for the macaroons.  Pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered the Greek meatball special and it arrived to the table burned - not simply overcooked but half black.  I showed the assistant manager and she stared at me and simply said \"thanks for letting me know\" and walked away, never to be seen or heard from again.   My response to this below average food and service will be the same - to walk away and never return again

A cooking mistake is sometimes forgivable but poor management is not."}
