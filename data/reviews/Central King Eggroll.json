{"text":"Having moved to Phoenix from LA, I have been in search of good Vietnamese food, particularly pho.  Many disappointing experiences later, I found Central King Eggroll, in Goodyear of all places.

This family owned business serves amazing pho - and they are such a supersweet family.  I go about once a week, a fan of this joint to say the least."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time eating here. I really liked my tender beef and meatball pho. The broth was really hot like it suppose to be. The broth is very tasty and flavorful! They have plenty of veggies to go with my pho. I have had both taro boba and Thai tea with boba. They were both good! Staffs were friendly and attentive. Definitely would go back again!"}
{"text":"We came from California to visit for a few weeks and we were hungry for pho and eggrolls. We were surfing yelp for a decent Vietnamese restaurant. From the three reviews we read we decided to give this place a try. We ordered the beef rice noodle with rare steak and eggrolls. The meal was very satisfying and portions were good and prices were fair. This place is run by a family who formally had a restaurant in San Jose, California. The service was good and friendly. We will definitely come back for dinner to try their rice plates. They have 187 different items on the menu. WOW!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Came in on a Sunday night an hour before closing. Not  a lot of variety of pho but it did the job.  the egg rolls were to die for! I was surprised how fresh the food was at this time."}
{"text":"One of the best in the west valley! Fresh food and good service. Their pho is amazing!!"}
{"text":"quick and cheap. unique food to the southwest valley. pho is good and the place is clean"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here. Good Pho dac biet. Good com thit nung. Boba wasn't fresh but the goi coung was declious. Wish they kept the wild garlic in it like the old owners used to, but I think it's not compatible with the common American pallette. The restaurant is pretty clean, but those who know can attest that the best Pho is often found in the not so cleanest of places..."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, the food was amAzing, we had vermicelli.  The Mango smoothy was beyond good!"}
{"text":"First time eating here, the food was exceptional! Pho was the best I've had in long time along with the egg rolls! To top if off, the prices were super low! If I didn't live so far, I would definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"Visiting friends nearby who took us here. Love the pho, which tasted great, not too much msg. Springrolls nice and crispy. Grilled pork chop plate also good. Good sized portions, everyone happy. Service nice and efficient. Next time in Phx, will go again."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for some spring rolls  delish"}
{"text":"The place to be if your in the neighborhood! Specializing in Vietnamese cuisine, the family is originally from California so expect the food to be diverse, authentic, tasty, and most importantly - to die for! And as Arizona goes, Vietnamese cuisine or asian food in general is scarce and King Eggroll is AZ's premiere place to be. Their noodle soup is great, their rice plates are my favorite, and their desserts are delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the workers who makes the food disgusted me. She is an old lady who wore a blue glove. She would touch food, eat food and then touch restaurant stuff using the same glove. I also saw 2 girls who looked to be under 10 years old being used to serve out water."}
{"text":"I love eating here! The owners are really friendly once you go a few times they even remember what you like to eat. They had the best spring rolls for the price and for how big they are! I also get Pho with beef when I go and its always delicious. I order to take home and I like the way they package their to-go orders. Anytime I can eat at King Eggroll I will!"}
{"text":"I have been here four or five times now in the past couple of months, and I always get the same thing. When I find something I really like, I tend to stick with it. I order a #14 beef pho, and it is delish!  Today I ventured out and tried something new, and was also very impressed, so I finally had to write about it.

The portions are relatively small. I don't have a huge appetite, and I am able to easily take down the entire small pho, which is $5.50. Most people would probably want to order a large unless they are getting other food as well. I think the large is only a buck more. So the prices are fair, I think. The pho is really good, with super thin sliced beef that is low in fat. Everything else is pretty standard. 

Today I also ordered some BBQ pork chow mien to take home. It was great! It was loaded with veggies; green onion, yellow onion, green bell pepper, broccoli, carrots, cabbage, bok choy.... I love veggies, so this was a pleasant surprise for me. 

I like that the sauces and service ware is right there at the table for you. The service has been hit or miss every time I have gone. Sometimes they bring me the check, sometimes I have to get up and pay. I never really know what to expect, but the food has always been good. I will continue to go here on a regular basis because of the food and it is so close to my house"}
{"text":"Tried the Korean bbq and it was bomb! And Mbeki husband tried the Mongolian dish and it was awesome!  Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Always great Vietnamese food at a reasonable price.  We didnt realize that they had recently changed ownership.  Service was not that great last time we were there, but the food was great!"}
{"text":"I have been eating Pho here for a couple of winters now and am pleased to say I have always had the same good soup and service. My wife likes the strawberry shake (?) with boba . I have not tried the rest of the menu but I do love the Pho."}
{"text":"So, I need to learn up a bit on my Vietnamese cuisine. I did not know that viet \"Spring Rolls\" were not fried. Shame on me. Their egg rolls are good sure, but the SPRING rolls are fantastic. Noodles, lettuce, meat..nicely rolled up in a cool unfried wrapper. Who knew? The shrimp & pork spring roll especially...only needed some fish sauce or normal teriyaki sauce for dipping. Good flavor and nice people."}
{"text":"Originally, I gave this place 3 stars, then changed it to 4 later.  Now, I intend to downgrade it once again.  My other half said, \"why are you downgrading them?  The food is good.\"  Yeah,  \"good\" ... as long as you order their sandwiches.  The rest ... blah!  The pho has good broth; but the so-called meat is either mostly bone with barely enough meat on the bone to satisfy a Chihuahua, who's a vegetarian or has more gristle than meat!  The \"rice dishes\" are absolutely named appropriately:  enough rice to send your blood sugar over 500 for the night, but less meat than a Vegan eats in a year!  The egg rolls and spring rolls are ... okay; nothing more.  And while the service is quick and friendly, the dirty tables and piled up dishes don't exactly excite you about your meal (what is it about dirty Vietnamese restaurants and piled up dishes on dirty tables?  Is it anathema to Vietnamese culture to buy a dishwasher or cleaning fluid?!?).

Sadly, this updated review is not the exception.  Anyone who's eaten at any Vietnamese restaurant will recognize at least one or more of my observations at their \"favorite\" hole-in-the-wall.  That's just the way it seems to be with these places.  Were I paranoid, I'd assume Vietnamese restaurants everywhere only did their shopping at butchers, who've sold out everything but soup bones.  The ironic thing about all of this is where other restaurants -- like PT noodles -- load their sandwiches with veggies to obviously save money on buying meat, this place loads their sandwiches with meat and skimps on the veggies!  Apparently, I just don't understand them ... which is okay:  they don't seem to understand most people who speak English either."}
{"text":"This place is over priced. Ordered shrimp,broc plate awful the shrimp was the size of a penny egg rolls hard to much sauce wouldn't eat here again YUK"}
{"text":"my favorite lunch place. ask for the grilled sandwich (bbq pork). i would easily pay double the $3 menu price.  best pho in west valley."}
{"text":"I use to go here quite often. The food use to be delicious and the service okay. I believe there was a change in owners, so the food isn't as good and nor is the service. The last time I ate here the server came back twice to ask me for my order, which he never wrote down. He even forgot to bring an item out as well which was quite frustrating. I ordered a grilled pork and shrimp with rice vermicelli, I only got two tiny shrimps and  few pieces of really greasy pork. I was very disappointed. What was also really frustrating was their drinking glasses were not clean, there was still residue from another persons mouth plastered to the rim of the glass. Not very appetizing. I do not think I will be eating here again, and I would not dream of telling anyone else about this place either.

It was nice while it lasted."}
{"text":"The lady in the front taking orders was yelling at me because they messed up my order last time. She said she tried to call me so I know she remembers me. They messed it up to begin with and should of handled it better. She said I have to bring it back same day I told her I live 1/2 hour away she told me that not her problem. She said she will talk to the manager and call me back. She never called me back."}
{"text":"Never have disappointed me the special pho that has all the trimmings is my favorite, as well as their spring rolls, I go there 1-2 times a month, but I could have it everyday, the servings are perfect and the cost is awesome! Great quality food and love that it's 5 min away.."}
{"text":"I asked for Chicken Chow Mein... this doesn't look like chicken or worth 7 dollars. It is dark meat at its finest. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I'm giving them a one star because I'm incredibly offended and livid by mine and my husbands experience with them. 

We ordered two bowls of soup and both asked for no vegetables in our soup. I even clarified \"just meat and noodles.\" Our food arrived at our table and of course, there's vegetables! I let him know the order was incorrect and get this, he said exactly: \"oh you didn't want onions and cilantro? You said no veggies so I told them no side plate of veggies. Next time say no onions and cilantro. Just pick them out I'll bring you plates to put it on.\" He essentially refused to take our food back and correct it when clearly he was incorrect yet he still forced us to eat it. I barely was able to touch my food at all because I have a stomach sensitivity to onions. Not once did he even bother to come back and check up on us. We are never going back here again. Going back to our old spot in Surprise."}
{"text":"This place is dirty, and stinky, like wet mop and sewer. Ordered the spring rolls, they were ok, i guess nothing memorable. And i also ordered the beef Pho. It came out fast, but also forgettable."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends before celebrating my birthday and came back a couple times later! I've had the Pho Ga and the Pho Bo. Both are delicious but I like the Pho Bo (beef) better. From what I've seen they keep the place pretty clean and are good on service, and friendly. I would recommend going here. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Mmm I just found my favorite Vietnamese restaurant! Their pho was delicious! The broth was flavorful and the noodles were cooked just right. The meat was tender and thin sliced. Eggroll a were so yummy too. We orders Beef Luc Lak for the little one and the beef was very soft and juicy."}
{"text":"First of all, I need to thank Larry because I chose to try this place over others because he said the owners are from San Jose, CA.  I figured anyone from Cali must know what they're doing with their pho.

Let's start from the beginning.  When you walk in, they restaurant has a very clean atmosphere for a pho/Asian place.  The service is friendly and the prices are exactly what pho should cost - around $5 or 6.

Onto the food...  The pho is not the BEST I've ever had, but it is GOOD.  They give you plenty of meat and it doesn't sit in the hot broth too long before they bring it out, so it has that perfect soft melt in your mouth texture rather than some places that make 'em way too chewy.  The noodles could be more aldante, but it wasn't overly bloated.  The broth was the only dept they could use an improvement in, as that was the part of the pho I thought was subpar.  Don't get me wrong, I think their pho is great and I plan on going back lots of times.

One of my fav things about this place are their spring rolls and the selection of drinks.  The spring rolls are cheap, well wrapped, and they put plenty of mint in them.  Just to warn ya, if you read the previous reviews and order the great \"pomegranite\" drink, it's not pomegranite.  They're little red jellie balls - but it is one of my favorite vietnamese drinks and I always get one when I go here.  

BTW, my rating is completely based on their pho.  I tried the charbroiled beef bun once and it was definitely dissapointing.  Meat was dry, it had more noodles than vegis, and not enough flavor.

I haven't tried other pho places in AZ, so I'll update my reviews once I can compare them to the other local restaurants.  =)"}
{"text":"Worst pho in the valley. I've known 3 different people who have found random things in their pho (pieces of rubber glove, bones, plastic, etc.) including myself.

Anyone who thinks this is good pho is either employed by the restaurant and is completely biased, or has never had good pho to know any better."}
{"text":"Went there and got a banh mi and Thai tea with boba and it was not bad.  The Thai tea tasted good and the boba was alright.  The banh mi is pretty good and their bread is soft and for $3 a sandwich I thought it was a good deal.  People were friendly and the place was decent would go there again."}
{"text":"I am a big stickler for bad service and when you have a destination with really good food it is heartbreaking to give them 3 stars.  Let me preface that I am a newcomer to the Vietnamese art of Pho so proceed with caution; although, my pallet is pretty boss so I think I am spot on. :)  I have been visiting several locations around town and thus far this place has a good thing going.  The serving sizes are very generous and their broth is very balanced so you can season to your liking.  They have very good egg rolls and their sauces are great.

Now the service, I visited this place initially and their service was very good.  The problem is when there is more than 2 tables being served it gets rather unorganized and this bleeds into just utter disappointment.  We waited for some time to get service and we were not sure who was our server because they seemed to share the tables.  You can imagine this not working, if not let me explain... We ordered our food and the food came out as usual but then it just went down from here.  We never got our herbs plates with the cilantro, jalapeños and limes they serve when they are not this busy.  I asked for the plate and never got it, I finally asked for more limes and they were nice enough to bring me just enough.  Our refills were far and few and lastly when it was time to pay it seemed like they didn't want to charge us because we waited, waited, waited more waiting until I spoke up and said how much longer do I have to wait to pay?

After this long but what I hope is an insightful review know that I definitely would recommend their food but will let you know to not expect good service."}
{"text":"This the greatest and truly authentic vietnamese restaurant in AZ so far. Closest thing to the Bay Area and so cal deal. They must have moved here from there for the better schools and less expensive housing."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight and was very disappointed in the older gentleman that works there (owner maybe?). I sat down and my arm stuck to the table, I look down and there is something sticky all over the table. The guy comes over to give us menus and I ask \"can you please wipe this table there is something sticky all over it?\". He looks down at the table and responds, \"its not dirty\" and walks away.

I then tried to wipe it myself with napkins and it was just tearing the napkin up with the sticky stuff. When the guy came back with the water he could now see the napkin sticking to the table and again I asked \"can you please get a rag?\" to which he reluctantly went and got.

Walking out we walked right past him and he didn't thank us or anything."}
{"text":"I've had pho and spring rolls at several Vietnamese restaurants,  and this is one of my favorite places for both.  I always get the rare beef pho (#14), and it's so tender.  They are also reasonably priced. I've had their Thai tea, potstickers, BBQ pork fried rice, a vermicelli plate, to name a few.  Their grilled pork bahn mi is also great at only $3."}
{"text":"FYI the cooks are the same and athe ownership is friends of the previous owners. This place has changed owners several times but have not changed their cooks. Awesome food always delivered and great service. I am Asian and I know what is good asian food! Their Banhxeo (Vietnamese crepes ) is awesome and they also servies Banhmi (Vietnamese Sandwiches)"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was little to be desired.  Both the hubby and I ordered different rice noodle (not pho but the dry kind with fish sauce) with meat on top and the flavor I thought was pretty good.  The menu items are also reasonably priced.  The wait staff, however, could use a little sprucing up.  Our waiter just kind of plopped the plates on our table and left.  No \"Enjoy your meal\" or \"How are things?\".  It looks like it's run by a \"real\" Vietnamese family so you know that all that matters in places like this is that the food is good, which I can't complain about."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  The pho here has really deep developed flavors.  Good sized portions & good prices."}
{"text":"Very first place I tried pho and keep coming back.  I've tried other places and does not compare to King Eggroll. Service is excellent, we always get our food quickly. Everyone is friendly too."}
{"text":"This place is so wack. I ordered their wonton soup and it wasn't still half raw. Only non-Asians rate this place more than 1 star. If you want good Vietnamese food go to Pho 43."}
{"text":"We are addicted to the spring rolls with the peanut sauce and hot sauce , sooo fresh and tasty ! I believe it is family owned and they work there. Always clean and they remember what we like and greet us like family. Would have the spring rolls every day if I could. My husband is know as the funny man that makes them laugh. Recommend highly"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for the past year and the Pho has been ok. Broth is good! I might try something else next time im here(maybe not) as i only come every couple of weeks and that would be for my Pho Phix."}
{"text":"I am new to Vietnamese food. I tried PT Noodles a couple weeks ago, and enjoyed it. Today some co-workers invited me to go to lunch with them at King Eggroll, and I'm very glad they did. 

We started with the spring rolls. Very fresh, and very tasty, and the sauce they brought for dipping was delicious (especially once I added some of the Sriracha (sp?) hot sauce they keep on the tables). 

I ordered #14, Pho with beef. The broth was delicious, but needed something. My companions recommended the Sriracha and the Hosien sauces, and I fiddled around until I found the perfect balance for me. 

I ordered the \"large.\" It was a LOT of food, but I pretty much finished it. I even started drinking some of the broth from the bowl, but felt a little uncouth so I left the rest. 

The service was good. Very polite staff, short waits for everything, refilled our water. The price was very reasonable, just over $11 for the large Pho and 3 good sized spring rolls (I shared).

Highly recommend you give this place a try. I'm going back."}
{"text":"We love this place, after moving from Seattle where Pho was easy to get we found ourselves lucky to have come across this one.

The owners (mostly family run) are very friendly, the food is very tasty, they have quite the following in the asian communitee (which should also speak well of their food).  I enjoy their grilled/sliced pork (i don't really get into the Pho) but my wife almost always get one of their many Pho dishes.

We have sent friends there as well and they also leave with the same feedback of good food at a good value."}
{"text":"Of the two Vietnamese places near me, this one and PT noodle, I prefer this one. In fact, this is the only place I go on this side of town when I need a pho or fried rice fix and iced coffee. I really like the fried rice mixed plate but their pho isn't bad either. Service is about what I expect at most hole-in-the-wall restaurants and the decor and space are a little old but the prices are low, the food tasty, and the staff friendly. Now I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Well a good friend took me here for my first bowl of Pho about three or more years ago and I haven't found a place I like better. I'm new to the world of Pho, I've only been seeking it out for three years (and only during cold weather) so I may not be an authority. However, I can say I've yet to find a better bowl in the Valley. If you want a place that is chic and trendy, do not come here. If you're looking for authentic, you've found it!

Very reasonable in prices too, super friendly and yes, obviously English is their second language. That's awesome! It adds to the experience in my opinion. Oh yeah, don't leave without trying their Banh Mi & pork egg rolls. Love it!"}
{"text":"Bún Riêu is good but needs a little more flavor, clean place. The staff is great, service fast, polite. 
Definitely will come back. A"}
{"text":"Great food and it won't put a hole in your wallet.  I love the Spicy Beef Vermicello soup and the rice crepes, and the avocado shakes.  I can eat here everyday."}
{"text":"My first Pho was had here!  Two of my friends had mentioned how much they loved this spot for their pho and years ago I had tried to go only to find they are randomly closed on Tuesdays or whatever day it had been.  

For my first bowl of pho, I was impressed but slightly weirded out that there was a slight sweet taste to my broth.  I had ordered the beef on the side in order to pull it apart into smaller pieces.  I definitely wish their pieces were smaller so I wouldn't have to first pull them apart.  They brought plenty of veggies to plop into it though.  The prices are right for sure.  Since having my first bowl, I have moved on to another pho spot closer to home though and enjoy it even more.  But, Central King is worth a stop if you want some quick and inexpensive pho to satisfy a craving.  There were a ton of people coming in and out and dining there."}
{"text":"I just moved to Goodyear recently, and I was so happy to have found this lone Vietnamese restaurant! I came into the restaurant not knowing what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised.  

Based on one of the reviews below, I thought the restaurant would be dirty.  I'm not sure we ate at the same restaurant, because I thought the place looked pretty clean.  Definitely cleaner than the local Denny's.  Being from San Jose, CA  (where the quality of the food seems to be more valued than hygiene), I have been spoiled with good Vietnamese food at every other street corner.  I will miss having that, but I was glad to see that this restaurant is very authentic and has an extensive menu that includes rice plates, Vietnamese crepes (banh xeo), noodle soups, milk tea drinks with pearls, and even roasted chicken with red rice (com ga roti)!

The restaurant seemed to be run by a family.  On the day I came in, the mom was chef, the dad was the food prepper, and the children were waiting/bussing tables.  With that, the pho we ordered did take a little long to come out.  I've eaten a whole lot of pho in my life, and I can say this wasn't the best pho, but it was tasty enough to satisfy my pho cravings.  The portions were a perfect in size, not too large, but enough to leave me comfortably full.

I will definitely be coming back when I'm missing my Vietnamese home-cooked meals (which I have a feeling, will be often).  I cannot wait to try their com ga roti and banh xeo!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good Vietnamese food, this is the place for you. If you want a fine dining experience, go someplace else."}
{"text":"I make some great tasting phö but when I don't want to cook it and am craving it, I go here. It's decent phö on the west side. I enjoy it each time I go."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for a few years now. It's switched owners a couple of times I believe. The quality has been consistent despite the change! Ive tried many Pho dishes here and all have been good. The spring rolls are better than most places I've been to, which is why I always come back to this establishment. I LOVE spring rolls, so it's a big deal for me to have a good spring roll. 

The Pho dishes are all house made and very fresh. I've tried all the different types of Pho's with different meats and noddles. All have which been consistent. It comes with the usual toppings and side dishes. 

The spring rolls are one of the best here. It doesn't fill up the whole roll with lettuce which most other places do. It has slices of pork and shrimp in it, you can get it w/o pork (I think). The sauce here is very good as well. It's not too sweet and full of peanut taste. I add siracha and the red chili to it. 

The Vietnamese coffee here is GREAT! Strong strong strong coffee and sweet too. It's like liquid candy! I've gone there and just ordered a viet coffee before. I don't know why but it's tastes THAT good to me!!!"}
{"text":"Worst imitation of Vietnamese food and absolutely horrible customer service.... I will never come back again!"}
{"text":"Best Pho place in the West Valley. Serving size and price are reasonable as well. I love their egg rolls and Special Pho, it never fails. I would drive down to this place instead of going to some Vietnamese restaurants near my place (Surprise)."}
{"text":"Their Pho has the best meatballs, and the serving size is perfect!"}
{"text":"The pho here is good! Especially since there are no other vietnamese places in a 30 mile radius.  So, if you are feeling like pho come here get the chicken pho or beef pho, it hits the spot.  The rating isn't higher only because I'm used to bay area pho."}
{"text":"Pretty solid Pho. The broth is good but not the best I've had. The rice noodles are really good at absorbing the flavor. The Banh MI was fantastic especially for 3.50. The bread was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The service was good, also. This place is a nice inexpensive vietnamese restaurant with a huge menu. I'll make sure I try something different next time."}
{"text":"The food was decent but the service was slow. In my opinion the most important component for pho is the broth. Theirs was not quite as beefy compared to others places but it was aromatic, you could taste the flavors of ginger and star anise in the soup.The noodles were cooked well, so that's a plus, and accompanying the dish is the usual bean sprouts, jalapeno, lime, and basil.

Overall pretty average place, not the worst choice if you're looking for a Vietnamese restaurant in the area but there's definitely room for improvement."}
{"text":"I came in here with my family for dinner. For the most part it seems like an ordinary Vietnamese/Pho restaurant. 

I got the broken rice dish (com tam dat biet). It's a big portion of food, which was perfect because I was really hungry. What I liked about it is it gives a lot variety of sides to go with the pork chops (which were all good, but not amazing). The shrimp that came with it was good, the egg cake was good (sometimes places make this too salty, but this was just right). I'm not a big fan of the grilled pork sausage/paste (which was worse than most due to its firmer texture) or the friend shrimp paste (not enough shrimp/roll ratio. The pork itself was marinated fairly good, but could use some more salt. However, it was cooked just right (not dry at all).

The pho here was not really good. Broth lacks the sweet beef flavoring."}
{"text":"Hooked on the Eggrolls.

I have driven by King Egg Roll dozens of times, not realizing it was a Pho restaurant.  The name that is visible from the street is simply \"King Egg Roll\" and I assumed it was aChinese restaurant.  When we drove up and parked, we realized that it was Vietnamese and were very pleased.

I haven't ordered the Pho yet, but from what we've seen in subsequent visits, the Pho looks delicious.  I have to be bones lately I've been hooked on the Pork fried rice, Pork and veggies and the egg rolls for a good long time. The Egg Rolls are fantastic, hot, crispy, and full of flavor. The Fish Sauce served with the egg rolls is amazing, I would eat it by the quart.

The Staff is friendly, service is good, atmosphere is dated  but comfortable. I wohld recommend this as a good family eating experience."}
{"text":"Both kinds of pork and shrimp spring rolls (including the thick peanut sauce), beef pho, sweet pork meatball sandwich, rice crepe, and vermicelli noodles with rolled beef & egg roll are all my fave anywhere so far. The mango shake and beef, chicken, and shrimp fried rice are all good. The water has always tasted odd to me. Maybe chlorine idk. Anyways, the prices are the best I've seen overall. This is my number one Vietnamese restaurant anywhere as of October 2017. I may continue to update this review."}
{"text":"It's okay...I tried pho here again simply because I live close by.  When I'm at work, I always go to Pho Thanh - by far the best pho in Phoenix!

I ordered the large Pho Tai this time as the last time I had the regular bowl and they totally skimped on beef.  This time there was more beef but not enough noodles - especially for a large.  I had to ask for more rice noodles and again I had to ask for cilantro and lemon as the waitress originally brought out TWO SPRIGS of basil for a large bowl of pho.  For a California Vietnamese family, I would expect better.  I'm used to places like Pho 79 and Pho Lampson in the Westminster area - this place is okay if you're desperate and today I was."}
{"text":"I come here very time I crave some Vietnamese food. I generally get the pho special which has a mix of everything in it. It's delicious whether you get it to go or dine in. I like to add summer rolls or spring rolls on the side. Went to pt noodles once for a change it was a huge disappointment!!! So came back running to my favorite place :-)"}
{"text":"Pho king A : )
They are back. My last time in there was disappointing and promised never to return.  The pho was horrible and flavorless. A coworker had the same experience but she gave it a second change and told me that they were back to their old favors. Well, I had to go back and give them a second chance.  I always order the same thing (pho) so my review only focuses on one thing so I do not know about the rest of the menu.  For the last couple months I've been looking for another pho place and had to leave the Avondale area.  I've been to little Saigon in Glendale which was good but nothing to really attract me again.  Saigon kitchen in surprise is delicious but a bit out of the way. Angelina's on bell is also good but too far away.  King eggroll's pho is delicious (not exactly the same way I remember it but that might be more in my mind). The broth is what gives it the great flavor and you cannot beat the price.  It is cheap (at less than $6 compare to $9 at other places) and I will definitely be back again & again.  Service was great but that could be because there was only one other table there. I definitely re-recommend it to everyone who loves pho. Glad to see them back"}
{"text":"We have tried many Vietnamese restaurants and this place is our favorite.  We go back weekly to have the Pho and Vermicelli. We have traveled all over asia and this place serves one of the best in the U.S. Only the restaurants in Honolulu's China Town beats this."}
{"text":"I ordered spring rolls, grilled beef w/green onions salad and rice - my meal was super yummy!  Everyone else I was with also enjoyed their entrees.  I cannot stress enough; the food was delicious.  

Before leaving  I ordered a jack fruit shake with boba.... they got my order wrong and I wound up with a durian fruit shake which was still okay but not what I wanted.  I usually get my boba from Lollicups and I think I'll stick to what I'm used to because it just wasn't that great from King Egg Roll.   

The service on the other hand left a lot to be desired.  We didn't get our appetizers until right before we paid and we had to ask three times to get to-go boxes.  They don't give you tickets which would be fine unless you made a large order or are in a large group.  A few people had to go back more than once to make sure they paid for everything."}
{"text":"Pho is absolutely amazing! Huge portions, very reasonable pricing!!"}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Vietnamese food ! Serving size are larger, bowls are big and plate is bigger and affordable."}
{"text":"Good Pho! Bad service, too informal and not a very inspiring decor at all. But, it is the closest we have in the far west valley. It does need TLC outside but the Pho is super yummy..."}
{"text":"Good food when it comes out as ordered. Another location I can not seem to get my order correct at all times. Staff/family is somewhat friendly. The environment seems clean and its location is great. Get my order right next time and I'll alter my review."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for awhile now. The restaurant has gone through some management change but the \"Pho\" still is great.
Communication is limited unless you get a young man that has different sports cars from time to time.
Good portions and we never had a problem with quality. Differently a place to go."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the years, and I just don't understand the high ratings this restaurant receives.  Yesterday, my family wanted to try Wood Flame Burgers, but they were too crowded, so I decided to give Central King Eggroll another chance.  \"Trust me,\" I told my wife, \"they're getting a lot of great reviews now.\"  My wife ordered the sweet and sour chicken, which was a mistake.  She barely ate any of it.  I ordered the vermicelli, and it was okay.  After reading the reviews again, we probably should have tried the pho instead.  Try it out for yourself and decide.  You may like it."}
{"text":"I used to eat here since 2010 until it went under management change. Stopped coming since then. (Not sure if it is the same management since the change) I decided to give it another try since it was so close to home. Quality and taste has improved. Love the pho and egg rolls. I love how they still offer two different sizes for the soup (small or large). A small was more than enough for me. I will be returning for sure! 


Cons: booth seat felt a bit far from the table, I found myself sitting at the edge.
Seasoning bottles were sticky and felt dirty.
Some of the servers were limited on their English."}
{"text":"I've been coming here once every 2 weeks for the past 2 years and I must say that they keep me comming back with their food. It seems that they did have a change of management because the faces have changed in the past few months. The only thing that changed is the service. In the past few times we came in, orders have been getting mixed up or we end up not getting what we ordered at all. Our favorites are the eggrolls, springrolls, roti chicken, bbq ribs, sea food combo pho and beef and tendon pho. With an avocado shake to wash it all down."}
{"text":"Central King Eggroll.  I've always loved asian food.  Went here for lunch for a buddy of mine who was leaving to North Dakata and not only that this restaurant had vietnamese food but other varieties such as Chinese.  I had the \"Pho Combination\" which included, tripe, meatballs, and beef flank.  If you are on the West side of Phoenix in Avondale, this is a place to stop if your craving some asian food.."}
{"text":"The pork potstickers were delicious and the chicken pho was ok. Could have had a little bit more chicken and maybe some cilantro but I didn't ask for that."}
{"text":"The food was good, I ordered some pho and my friend order the egg rolls, we all had fun but in the end one of us got food poisoning, so I will not be coming back to this place"}
{"text":"I have been here several more times, I guess it is time for a re-review.  The food has improved and the service too...  This family owned place looks like it is doing good!!

Soy milk - YUM

Fried egg rolls - Every good!

Bun Thit Nuong - the grilled pork was good, the noodles were just right, and the fish sauce added made it very good."}
{"text":"Love there pho and egg rolls. I come here for there pho because they are not skimpy on there beef and meat balls. The place is not the cleanest but who cares, the food is delicious. This place in my opinion has the best egg rolls, and I have tried many from many different Vietnamese places"}
{"text":"Food was good, however I'm not sure what happened to the service.  The typically good service was replaced some terrible and I mean terrible servers."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and had the chicken pho and and mongolian beef with red rice. All was delicious...but I especially loved their red rice, it was spicy and soooo good. Everything is very reasonably priced and you can even get it delivered from a service called You Buy and We Fly!!"}
{"text":"Amazingly good!  Don't discount it as I did based upon the name and location, this place is really excellent!  The Pho is fantastic and the spring rolls are really superb!"}
{"text":"chill hangout spot over a hot bowl of pho. prices are good, boba is good. always satisfies the Pho craving/hangover. #11, #61 is the way to go."}
{"text":"I am picky picky when it comes to my Pho and while I was hesitant to try this spot of a friend of mines I agreed seems how I was in the area and can ALWAYS eat pho!

Normally any pho place that doesnt serve cilantro on the plate of veggies completely SUCKS!  Thats not a fact, there wasnt any scientific research done on this, just my theory/thought/experience...  Moving on...

So we order, I always go with the Pho Tai at a new spot and later move on to the \"Special\" if its deemed worthy...  I knew ahead of time that cilantro did not come on the plate so I asked the lady for some on the side which she gladly brought.  The plate of veggies arrives, I look down.... LEMON!??!?!?!  LEMON I SAY!!!?!?!?!  WHAT THE PHO!!!!!!!!!!  

So now I am thinking \"Oh this is really going to suck, not only is cilantro not a staple on the veggie plate but they serve LEMON instead of limes!!!!\"

The not so \"Small\" sized bowl of pho tai comes out, looks good, smells good but I am still thinking its not going to taste very good...  I dress my pho up the way I like it and taste the broth...  OOOOHHHHH!  \"What is this tasty goodness in my mouth?\".

The broth was so rich and flavorfull I hadnt even noticed the lemon I squeezed in my bowl or that I was missing my limes...  AMAZING!

I had been craving a taro root boba for many months so I figured I'd grab one while I was here, again, AMAZING!  This is probably the best spot for boba's, 2nd best, which used to be the best was LeeLee Market...

Now my only problem is that I live in Phoenix and this place is in Goodyear, OY!"}
{"text":"The chicken and shrimp pho is so pho king good. I'm eating it when it's 100+° out...it's that fresh and yummy! Staff is quick and friendly!"}
{"text":"We are regulars here.  Very good Pho. Locally owned.  

But be warned...it can be slow.  Don't go there if you with family members who are starving.  It could get uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Pho is decent, decor isn't.   Place is run by family.  Son is the cashier most of the time, and father is usually the waiter, then mother usually cooks behind the kitchen, if I remember correctly.  

Most of their food is okay, and tasteful.  I remember ordering pork chop plate with rice, and  was I disappointed.  40% meat and 60% fat on it.  Where is the meat?? lol..  

If you enjoy good bowl of Pho, well here is a tip! Don't order the large size.  You will just end up with extra soup, not the noodles.  So make sure to ask for extra noodles, otherwise, you will loading your stomach with liquid! 

WARNING:  Owner likes wearing his slippers while he is serve food.  So whatever you do, don't look at his FEET! It will kill your appetite! lol!"}
{"text":"My favorite pho place on the west side. The food is really good. I usually get the broken rice plates or beef pho. They have a nice sized menu so you can choose what appeals to you from a decent selection. 

Update: I have been coming here for awhile and I am sad to see that it has declined in food quality. I got very sick for a couple of days after eating their lukewarm Pho. If I do go there, it will only be for non-pho eating."}
{"text":"I love this place, I come here at least twice a week. I'm not the biggest fan of Pho because I don't like the broth, so if you are only looking for pho then I can't help you. I am addicted to their bun though, it's a bowl of vermicelli on top of been sprouts and shredded lettuce with your choice of meat on top, either chicken beef or pork. It also comes with two chopped up eggrolls on top and I like to mix all the meat noodles and eggroll together and season it to taste. I have tried a couple of different places all over the valley and King Eggroll is by far my favorite. If you get the chicken it's grilled and doesn't look all that appetizing at first but when you bite into it, it is tender and juicy and delicious! I like getting the beef the most because they roll a green onion in their strips of beef and slice it up so that the beef rolls you are eating has a slice of green onion in it...amazing! No place else I have found either here or in Vegas does that for their beef. Although I'm not into Pho all that much the least I can say is that I am a regular in there and I have seen regulars in there who go there a lot because they love the Pho...so it can't be that bad, right? The people are very nice it seems clean and although there are always people in there, it never seems crowded. Reasonably priced and great food. Excellent restaurant that I recommend to my own family."}
{"text":"Well the old owners may have been from San Ho but they sold it to another family from Minn. or something like that. I personally think the pho broth is a little cinnamon strong but if you add some nuoc beau to the broth it will make it taste a whole lot better. Normally I order the pho dac biet, which i've been eating since the mid 80's but I recently started to order the Bun Bo Hue which I think is a lot better (broth wise) because of the lemon grass that the stock is made with. If you need a pho fix, the place is decent. As far as the prices.... I remember when I could get a bowl of pho for $3.50 back in the days."}
{"text":"I love PHO.  I can come here and tear it up. I love that the location is near. I have tried the beef Pho and it hits the spot every time. It is clean and refreshing. Good enough for me. It hits the spot when you have had a few beers the night before. It also hits the spot if you just want some good ol soup. I am also a fan of the spring rolls and the sandwiches.  Everything is fresh and its just a good food that does not weigh you down on a busy day.  The prices are inexpensive. Quite affordable for the big family. So far I have not had any problems with the service or food.  For now I will keep a good rating on Central King Eggroll."}
{"text":"Great place for Pho in the SW Valley!  I go there for lunch the Pho has a great taste, beef is tender and rice noodles very good, plus the broth is yummy.  Only problem it's close on Tuesday."}
{"text":"This is one our favorite lunch stops.  Their spring  rolls are delicious. Also the special Pho soup is good"}
{"text":"The price is right, the pho is great, egg rolls are good, and the spring rolls are good as well. Definitely our favorite pho spot on the west valley. Don't let the hole in the wall vibe turn you away."}
{"text":"I have loved this place for many years. Well tonight is my start to never going there again. I ALWAYS order the same thing. Beef stew no veggies with rice noodles.. I am sick tonight so I order over the phone. I tell the lady who answered the phone my order. Beef stew no veggies with rice noodles, only the beef and noodles. She asks if I want onions I said no only the beef and noodles, just beef and noodles. She says ok. So I have someone pick it up for me and I open it and there are carrots. I start digging around for the beef and there is barely any in there. So I call and I'm kind of feeling like she's giving me an attitude when I told her there are carrots and her reply is to just pick them out. I told her I said that I didn't want veggies and there is hardly any meat. She kept saying sorry what do you want me to do. I let her know telling me sorry and  to pick the carrots out when I told her no veggies more than once is doing nothing for me. She said the stew usually comes with carrots and I told her yes hence why I said NO VEGGIES. I told her I would save it and take it back tomorrow and get my money back. She says she'll pass my complaint to the manager and put more meat in my order next time. How about NO. My order should've been correct when I ordered and they could've been way less stingy with the beef"}
{"text":"Have been here several times and it's good. I prefer the beef stew pho the best. I have tried the other variations and think the beef stew has the best flavor broth. Beef chunks are tender and very flavorful; would like one or two more chunks. Coffee isn't bad. Boba and milk tea looks good but have yet to try. The vermicelli cold noodles with the grilled pork and cold vegetables are really good too."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food in Avondale/Goodyear Arizona.  Hole in the wall, family own.  Very nice staff.  Price is resonable.  Greatest fried egg role.  We come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"I love their vermicelli bowl with pork and egg roll! Some of the tastiest pork west side of the Mississippi!"}
{"text":"I just moved here a month ago and this is my 3rd pho place I've tried. By far it is the best! I love that everything is super hot/fresh when it comes out! We had spring rolls, egg rolls, Pho Dac Biet and bun thit nuong cha gio (vermicelli with beef and egg roll). All was fantastic"}
{"text":"DIRTY PLACE! this place is one of the dirtiest place I have eaten.  I went there and I saw with my own eyes that the cook walked out without washign his hands!!!!!!!! Yuck.  We walked right now and on our way out we saw the delivery guy who was packing food just sneazing without covering his mouth!!! We asked to talked to the owner and he did not speak english well to even understand how serious this matter was."}
{"text":"I love the chicken pho here, egg rolls are great, I love that they keep refilling my water, it's a great experience and not expensive"}
{"text":"Pho-rmidable noodle bowl option

Not many options for pho and bun in the West Valley, so King Eggroll wins partly by default.  They have a standard menu and you can even buy a boba tea with your meal.  Service is nice enough, depending who you get.  Casual dive on par with other Pho places.

I'd rank a star higher if their food was more consistent.  Recently, their broth is watery and lacks rich flavoring.  Vegetables can be somewhat tasteless, as well.  On past visits, the broth is flavorful and rich with peppers that add some tasty pop to the meal.  Oddly, I find their eggrolls so-so and missing good crunch.

We'll visit again to see it things improve.  Otherwise, we may have to start heading up to Glendale."}
{"text":"The pho is great here! I always order seafood pho and add tendon. Along with spring and fried egg rolls. I come so often, one of the male servers already knows my order. Very friendly staff! Love it here :)"}
{"text":"Yummy Yumm Yumm!

Short and sweet this place has some good Pho! It tastes great, the chicken is amazeballs because it's actually REAL chicken! The price is fair, about $7.50 for a large, the side sauces are separated and not pre-mixed together (I hate when places do that) and it's always fresh! Oh the service is fast too! I've always ordered to go, but it's quick and I like that I'm in and out in no time!

The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they have a bell on the door so each time someone walks in OR out the bell goes *ding ding dong dong - dong dong ding ding* ... if I was dining in I would probably have to rip it off! lol

Anywho if you're around and want some good Pho check them out! That's all I've ever order so that's all I'm reviewing, just fyi ;)"}
{"text":"First time having Pho and it was delicious!  Staff was very nice and prompt and the restaurant was very clean!"}
{"text":"The restaurant name sounds like a translation gone bad...and while this place had been up for some time and extremely close to my work, I didn't make the short trip simply because of a fear that I would find spaghetti in place of chow mein, and watered down leftover eggs in place of egg drop soup.

Imagine my pleasant surprise when I found that this place has an impressive menu that specializes in Vietnamese cuisine, and also keeps around some more generic Chinese, Korean, and Thai dishes for the faint of heart.

But you can't go to a Vietnamese restaurant and not try the noodle dishes.  The beef stew brought back some wonderful memories.  The noodles were tender, beef was melt in my  mouth, and seasonings were just right.  Pair the soup with some fresh basil and it's all good.

Spring rolls were fresh and tasty dipped in my favorite - peanut sauce.  I only wish there were some fresh peanuts sprinkled in for some added crunch.

What really added that extra star though, was the number of drinks and desserts on the menu.

Who can turn down Thai tea with pearls?
And Vietnamese dessert cups with pomegranate and coconut mixed with sweet milk and shaved ice?  2 Die 4!!

Prices are very reasonable and staff is very friendly.  This is definitely due for a return visit!"}
{"text":"First visit and food was very good. I had the sweet and sour chicken. The chicken was breaded but the taste was very good did not taste greasy or fried and the sweetness did not over bear the sourness very good combination vegetables were cooked properly yet crispy and delicious. 
Restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times in 1 month. Love their pho. The food serving/ price is real good considering their \"small\" bowls of soup are huge! Food is always fresh and doesn't take long to prepare but have been there with maybe 3 other tables of people around. One night a friend & I didn't realize that they were closing soon but one of the employees stayed late. I had the Beef ball pho and the spicy beef vermicelli from here and this mango tea slush dessert (don't remember the name) and love it. I recommend to others!"}
{"text":"I have had a bad experience with pho in the past. I tried this place by recommendation of a friend who I know knows his Vietnamese food.  We started off with egg rolls and then wet got the house fried rice. Both dishes were great and I loved the sauce they brought out with shredded carrots in it. *I'm not sure what it's called.  Then the real test the pho came out.  We ordered the large beef,  this was a huge portion so I recommend the regular size since this soup is only good eaten fresh.  The broth tasted good and the cut off beef wasn't too fatty like others I have had before.  I have had pho a total of 3 times so far and this place is by far the best.  I guess it's true, you need to go to the hood for good food"}
{"text":"Been coming her for the past 5 years or so and this place never fails !!! Love this place"}
{"text":"Place was not bad. Compare to all other pho restaurants i would rate this place average. I ordered the pho thai, the broth was little darker than what i had anticipated but after adding the condiments such as lemon, bean sprouts, basil, siracha, and hoisin sauce; it tasted pretty good. I would not recommend getting the egg roll, the filling does not taste good. Give this place a try if you are around."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning after eating here.  Vomited in the middle of the night, diarrhea the day after, and had dizzy spells for the next few days.  So sad.  I really like this place.  

What I had - Banh Xeo, Wonton noodle soup, and Bun Thit Nhuong Cha Gio."}
{"text":"Favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the valley. Great and fast customer service, delicious food, fantastic prices, and overall clean. Pho special and spring rolls are my life."}
{"text":"Their pho is awesome, no need to add anymore ingredients to the pho.. the soup broth is perfect..."}
{"text":"I've had some excellent, and quality Vietnamese food and unfortunately this place does not come even close. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"We love this place!!! Very good prices and the food NEVER fails to impress. When ever we have family/friends visiting and they ask where to eat this is where we take them every time and everyone loves it every time."}
{"text":"Just walked in & a couple followed, no one sat me, so I sat myself & waited for five minutes. Five minutes later nobody still came to wait on me. Another couple came in & were sat next to the table I sat, so I left; poor service."}
{"text":"So this review is totally biased - based on the pho alone, which was really good. I'm no expert when it comes to pho, but this stuff was good, with flavorful broth, tender beef and good noodles. Also came with all of the fixings - thai basil, limes and bean sprouts. 
I'll be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Restaurant also goes by the name Pho King Eggroll which is awesome by itself, but more importantly the food and service was great. Some of the employees seemed to have a little trouble understanding some of our questions due to what I believe was a language barrier, but they were extremely polite and someone was able to assist us promptly in taking our Take-out order. If you're looking for Vietnamese cuisine in the West Valley, this restaurant will not disappoint you."}
{"text":"This place has the best PHO on the west side :)  And they are know for their egg rolls.  My parents actually found this Vietnamese gem.  The staff is very nice and the food is cheap.  Always a great sunday lunch with the family!"}
