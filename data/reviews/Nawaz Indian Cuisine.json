{"text":"It is a small room, but clean. The couple that run the place are kind and helpful. The food was very good!  I had the chicken tikka marsala and it tasted as good as the same dish I've eaten often in India. There is a good selection of Southern Indian food.  Good, reasonable, but not fancy"}
{"text":"I went here for a second time today and I love the biryani here! The first time I came, I ordered the palak paneer which was well-flavored and tasty. I have dined here twice now and the only thing that I was not thrilled about was finding pieces of cinnamon stick and cardamon in my food. I believe this is the authentic style but  I was not expecting it so it surprised me. I also saw a lot of shelves which leads to to believe that they might be opening a new store inside as well! 

The owner is very nice and can customize your meal with regard to spice level. I love that the food is made to order! The salt lassi was not my favorite but the mango lassi is the best! I will be dining here again soon! Try this place!"}
{"text":"The worst experience, samosa was cold inside. Masala soda was made with half cooked onions and barely any potatoes. The sambal was so cold that it took away from the dipping experience. After perhaps a 100 dosas this was the worst. I said something to the cook and he got belligerent."}
{"text":"My companion and I ordered three dishes: palak paneer, lamb curry, and the chili chicken appetizer. All three dishes were well seasoned. The chili chicken appetizer was spiciest and would have been great with Indian beer. Our entries were served with a generous portion of rice. In the future, I might be tempted to order the food for takeout, as I am not a big fan of disposable plates. The service was excellent, though, and I truly hope that the owners can make a go of it. Look past the strip mall storefront and try this neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"I am South Asian so I know the family of Biryani dishes. I ordered  Goat Dum Biryani  and must give the dish five stars.
It was a festival of flavors.Brought back memories of my grandmother's cooking.If you want  an authentic experience try this dish."}
{"text":"After seeing high ratings on Yelp, we decided to drop in for dinner on Dec 24th! When we reached the place, it looked like a grocery store with food combo kind of place.
Even though it was empty, we decided to give it a try.

The food was not good at all. In fact, they were running to the freezer and getting a premade frozen kabob to fry and serve us. The lady who fried the kabob burnt it from outside but left it uncooked in the middle. They still served us the burnt food.

Everything was frozen and the folks in the kitchen were reheating the food and gave it to us.

Horrible food. I don't know how the folks selling the food can do so in good conscience.
Stay Away!! I never write Yelp review, but for the sole purpose of making sure others don't get duped by the incorrect ratings, I signed up @ Yelp to provide this review.

For the owners who read this review - please make sure you are honest with the clients. Not only are you serving bad food, you are endangering others health as well. Uncooked food, especially frozen and sitting in your refrigerator for God knows how long (do you even check the expiration date?) is a lawsuit waiting on happen."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant I have ever seen in Phoenix. Pathetic taste and so stubborn to take any inputs or suggestions from the customers."}
{"text":"Great tasting food with generous portions. Best Indian food in Phoenix. Very affordable."}
{"text":"This place is a true \"hole in a wall\" sort of restaurant, with no atmosphere but great food!  Everything tasted home-made with fresh ingredients.  Seasoning was well done with authentic Indian flavors.  The kitchen is exposed and the smell of Indian spices fills the restaurant.  Looking forward to trying some more of their spicy dishes."}
{"text":"It's a bad restaurant. Service is really too bad, food is very expensive. We wanted to add more rice, it's $3 per person. I'll never go there anymore."}
{"text":"We hadn't been here for awhile. Just left and the food is still excellent! We love it. They have some authentic Indian groceries too if you cook Indian at home."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Indian food and was very excited to find a place close to where we live. What a disappointment! The naan bread was actually pita bread, it looks store bought. The vegetable biryani was not fresh and steamed in an aluminum foil packet; it was not at all what we expected. We've experienced the wonderful, true, fresh Indian food and this is definitely not it."}
{"text":"The food tastes like it been sitting out to long
The Samosas were terrible the filling tasted a couple of days old the soda fountain soda was terrible  I opened the cooler to get canned soda and saw a bunch of opened food cans on a shelf the health Department needs to go in before they poison someone."}
{"text":"The food was terrible and not fresh. The chicken looked overdone and greasy. The Naan was clearly frozen. The place was dirty. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Fantastic food with great service. Our favourite dish is garlic naan and Andhra chicken curry. Really tasty one. You can order less spicy curry if u don't eat spicy food. Always we enjoy eating here!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian food please in Phoenix. Family owned and family runs it daily. Very warm people that are good people! 

They just started the lunch buffet, it is awesome! Try the fried rice and lamb curry. Check out the desserts. The chicken corn soup is worth the stop as well. 

Highly recommend to check it out if you are really hungry!"}
{"text":"Excellent  food in a humble setting with key foods for sale in the market. The lassi was very  tasty as well."}
{"text":"I've been to Nawaz several times now. Their food is excellent and affordable. Expect a casual atmosphere, great service and well prepared dishes."}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed. Returned here  after some time but the food has gone worse. Ordered a samosa and when it arrived, it was still cold inside. I would've loved this small restaurant to be successful, but with this food, there is only one it's going."}
{"text":"Very low class and unhygienic food... I am Indian and have had Indian food all over the US... This by far is the worst.

Ordered several dishes and each one was bad!! 

When I asked the owner about what I had ordered and what they have instead, he was very defensive... Not a simple sorry or anything like that....

Again, just bad food!"}
{"text":"Great food, especially the chicken dishes..they are delicious! Service is fast and none of the dishes are too expensive. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I'm no expert on Indian food and I only have it once in a blue moon, but I felt compelled to order some chicken tikka masala for takeout after I arrived in Phoenix for a business trip. 

It was a tiny little place and looked more like a convenience store with a small kitchen behind the counter, but there were a few small tables to sit at. It smelled great when I walked in, and the food definitely held up to my expectations! 

The chicken was very flavorful and wasn't very spicy as another reviewer had commented. It was a little less creamy than other versions I've had, but it was no less delicious. I had plenty left over to save for another meal. I did order the garlic naan as well, but there was a little bit of a strange taste to it that I didn't love.

Overall, don't let the looks of this place deceive you! I probably wouldn't sit here and eat, but I would definitely recommend it for takeout."}
{"text":"Tonight I decided to try this place for the first time and order takeout.  I got the special chicken biryani, vegetable samosas and garlic naan.  It is delicious!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nawaz Indian Cuisine now has  little buffet for $7.99. You get homestyle cooked chicken curry, chicken makhani, tandoori chicken, daal curry, okra, eggplant,naan and white rice. This is a small family owned shop. Great for fast take out.
It is delicious and everyone has to give it a try!!!! If the idea catches on then, Nawaz will be adding more buffet entrees soon."}
{"text":"An awesome, downright incredible meal. Service is personable. Food, truly an experience worth trying. Five stars all the way"}
{"text":"Not the best Indian food I have had. The food did seem greasy:( we ordered a few dishes and the chicken seemed off. I think there was also a hair in my food."}
{"text":"Steer clear of this restaurant! We ordered several food items from menu for to go and it turns out to be a very bad experience. Terrible food! very greasy and tasteless. Wasted hard earned dollars on this restaurant."}
{"text":"I typically love hole-in-the-wall, mom and pop shops so I makes me sad to give this place a bad review. I ordered the chicken tikka masala and it was ok, not creamy like it is supposed to be. The naan was a pita bread with butter and garlic, and I paid $2for it. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I took my daughter here on the recommendation of a classmate of mine. Just wow!!!! Some of the best traditional Indian cuisine I have had in a long time. I will be recommending this restaurant to everyone I know."}
{"text":"The place is a small grocery store cum restaurant. he ambiance is not very good. The AC was not working when we were there and there was a portable cooler that they had kept , but may be that was a temporary fix. We were there at around 2 pm and no one seemed to be there. Based on 4star rating, we decidee to give it a shot. We ordered chicken curry, andhra chicken curry and goat dum biryani. Its hard to go wrong with chicken curry. Both chicken curry and andhra chicken curry were exactly the same. Goat biryani was OK, but not that impressive either. Nothing was freshly made, as they were taking it out of freezer right in front of us and heating it up. We ended up being disappointed by ambience, service as well ad food quality."}
{"text":"I had the chalpala pulusu (fish).  It was excellent and the Service was extremely friendly.  I will definitely come back next time I am on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken Tikka masala extra spicy. What I got was really soupy and tasteless. Absolutely no spice whatsoever. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Best goat biriyani in this area !! Also good in appetizers and overall food quality is gr8"}
{"text":"This was a disaster. I love indian food & tried many indian restaurants in different states, but this was my worst experience. I ordered a chicken masala & it was tasteless! I also ordered raita & it was horrible. If u still wanna go try ur luck with Biryani but Im definitely not going here again!!"}
{"text":"Nawaz is good food. They're a new business, and so I want to clarify what is getting this place low marks and offer friendly (and free) suggestions to the owners so that they can really take their restaurant to the next level of success.



PROBLEM
The ambience. Presentation is everything. The restaurant looks very divey. 

SUGGESTION: 
With the substitution of the current flourescent lights for something that is a little warmer, not only will your customer walk into a more inviting environment, but your food will look better on their plates when they sit down with it. You don't have to spend a fortune on your lights, something cheap from Home Depot will suffice.

Play some music. No, don't play stereotypical music from India (every northern Indian restaurant does this for some reason and it's very boring). Give some life to your place with some ambient sounds other than the food cooking. 


PROBLEM: 
Your restaurant name. Nowhere in your restaurant name is specified that you cook in a SOUTHERN Indian cuisine. A simple tagline correction can entice customer traffic coming into the restaurant.

SUGGESTION 1: 
I love your food, because I know what southern indian food is like. Pressure cooked meats and vegetables, extensive use of diverse spices... I actually prefer it to Northern cuisine any day. But if you're going to advertise yourself as just \"indian\", you're going to get people who walk in with different expectations than the food that is served.

SUGGESTION 2: 
Offer a \"northern\" and \"southern\" style on the dish. For instance, I love your southern take on \"chicken tikka masala\". However, some of your reviewers do not. By simply offering a Northern and Southern option for some of your menu options, you enable higher marketability to your customers without having to spend money on different ingredients. You are still staying true to your original mission of delivering high quality southern Indian cuisine, and you still can make more customers happy with alternative options.

Let's use the chicken tikka masala example again. Every time I order it without spicyness, it is clearly still spicy. Because the southern indian definition of \"not spicy\" is very different from the northern indian definition of \"not spicy\". I still love the dish, but some customers don't.  You can solve this problem by cutting back on the spice in the northern version of the dish, and add in more yogurt to balance out the heat that the spices naturally will cause. AND, you get more VOLUME in the dish, so the customer thinks they're getting more out of the meal (yogurt is cheap to buy or make).

Basically, you could simply use the same basic recipe to develop a separate curry sauce with the same ingredients, but with just a few changes you can enable some great business strategies to take your food to success.



PROBLEM: 
Who knows about this restaurant? I only found it by driving by one day.

SUGGESTION: 
Use your social media outlets. I know you have a Facebook page, but I've never seen a paid ad. You don't need to spend much, just $15 a month so you get views on your restaurants. Random people who don't even live near the restaurant will get exposure.

When posting to social media, take note of high saturation times of when your customers will be online looking for food. Try posting before lunch hour, or dinner.

SUGGESTION 2:
Contact food critics. Invite them to your restaurant. Explain to them your love of food, tell them your story of why you started the restaurant. Offer all your food to critics for free, they are more likely to write stellar, amazing reviews of your restaurant which will boost up your reputation and bring more customers in. More customers, more success.



PROBLEM: 
Your photos on your Facebook page, except for one, has not been photoshopped. Cell phone pictures do not help especially with the poor fluorescent lighting. Fluorescent lighting does not make your food look good.


SUGGESTION:
Bring life into your photos. You can clearly make amazing dishes, but don't ruin it with a cheap cell phone pic. Run it through Photoshop, play with light and saturation post filters... Enable your food to make customers WANT to come to your restaurant.



PROBLEM: 
Empty shelves.

SUGGESTION:
I understand that the business owner is trying to change things up by turning the restaurant into a market. But if you're going to bring in empty shelves, take presentation into account. You had price tags on the shelf still from where you bought it. Take them off.


All in all, I think Nawaz has a great premise for their restaurant, but if they take the above suggestions into account, I think their business can REALLY take off as a great success in their first year of business. 

What I don't want to see is Nawaz tank because of poor business decision making. I know all restaurants operate on a budget, no different than any business, but informed business decision is key to business success."}
{"text":"So. The reviews were all over the place for this restaurant. But I had a hankering for palak paneer and there is not another Indian place for miles.  

Also, it is a Sunday and had been a long weekend with the kids. So, my lovely wife agreed to go and get takeout.

The stakes were high: if this dinner worked out, it would solve the dilemma of living very far from another restaurant. If not, I was going to be angry about the only option being subpar.

We ordered palak paneer and chana masala.  She came back a short time later - the order was ready in 10 minutes - with those items and an extremely large container of basmati rice.

At first look, and then first bite, I wasn't sure about the chana. It was with a little oiler than I am used to, but it turned out just to have separated in transit, and after stirring it up a bit, it was fine. My wife thought it was a little sweeter than some we've had in the past but I was certainly satisfied with the spice level.  

The palak paneer was outstanding. Equal to the best I've ever had. Had a kick, too. True, I was very hungry and was in the mood for it, but my wife agreed with me that it was tremendous.

I forced myself to stop eating so I could save a little of each dish for tomorrow.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Worst Biryani in Phoenix...hugely disappointed with the taste and choice of rice and meat for making biryani. It's not fair to call it Biryani at all."}
{"text":"The food was exquisitely seasoned. The variety of flavors and aromas was intoxicating. Palak Paneer with cardamom. Chicken Tika Masala. Goat vindaloo. All so spicy. All so tasty. 

While the food stood on its own, The store the restaurant is in is awkwardly setup with tables down one side and a mini market selling Indian spices, rices, naan mix, etc on the other.  Will likely stop in again to eat, but also to buy spices to try my hands at cooking some of this stuff at home. 

Worth trying the food.

Four stars for the food. Will overlook the decor due to exquisite flavors!"}
{"text":"Awesome pakora and creamy curries. Tucked in the corner of a strip mall at the corner of Dunlap and 19th Avenue, Nawaz is a hole-in-the-wall that serves up delicious appetizers and curry entrees. Sharing a table with a friendly Ai Culinary Art and Management student, I tried a variety of foods.

The spinach pakora for $3.99 came in a generous size. Crispy spinach and onions with complex flavors surprised me. I loved the mango chutney and mint chutney dipping sauce.

The chicken tikka masala is amazing, made with dark meat and layered with spices, finished with rounded creamy notes. I at it with crispy garlic naan that was not cooked in a tandoor or oven, but forgivable. 

I tried the bread pudding. Flavors were spot on wth sweet and spicy balance. I wasn't a fan of the texture. I want to try the gulab jamun or fried dessert dough balls dripping with honey next time.

Service was warm and friendly. Ask for Johnny. Food is Halal, I believe. Price is good. Flavors are spot on. They serve South Indian curries as well. The heat level is just right for the American palette. I wonder what it would've been like if I requested a spicier rendition. Do not be put off by the plastic ware and styrofoam plates. This Indian cuisine is LEGIT!"}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here. I ordered 2 samosas, chicken tikka masala, and garlic naan. The food was good; however, I wish I would have just gotten takeout. Next time I go I will do just that. The food was good, but I gave it 3 stars because I have had other, much better Indian cuisine in Phoenix. Considering the price, I might be back though."}
{"text":"I love Indian food but this place didn't not appeal to me very much.  When I walked in I was not acknowledged by the owner who was the only person in the restaurant.  When he finally did greet me he seemed very unhappy.  Maybe business is not so good for him I don't know bit as a customer I did not feel comfortable here. The lady that brought me my dish did not smile or say hello. Maybe this behavior is a cultural thing i don't know but i don't feel like eating here again. Fast as the food goes it wasn't good either.  Usually when I get the chicken Dahl it comes with boneless meat but instead I got a full chicken breast and leg. I had to pry off all the meat.  Not happy here. .. Good bye! !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a to go  biryani and chicken 65.
chicken 65 looks to be more colorful; which is not good for that good for the health..

they have a mini grocery inside their place. 

they have a open kitchen - which can be maintained  better and made attractive."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best authentic Indian food then this is the place to go! The food was delicious, they were very friendly and if I'm ever in the area again I will certainly go back!  Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Authentic gramma makes the dishes fresh from scratch. Vindaloo and Tikka masala were great. If you like spicy, you need to ask for it. Naan was light and soo good!! Don't let the small store/ restuarant fool you. This is good food, just in a weird location."}
{"text":"I do not like to leave bad reviews but I have to be honest with my fellow Yelpers. This place is right around the corner from work for me, so I wish that it was better. I ordered the Daal Curry which was very good. The rice that was served with it seemed old, like from yesterday as it was a bit crunchy. The peas and carrots were frozen... still frozen when brought to me. I also ordered Samosas which are pretty difficult to mess up. They must have made these ahead of time because they were warm on the outside but cold inside. I love Indian food but will not be back here again as I feel that I just wasted $13.00."}
{"text":"Wow! Pretty darn tasty. This is a strip mall, hole-in-the-wall dive restaurant, so I definitely suggest take out. Food is fresh. Pakoras and beef samosas were delicious. Pleased with their Biryani. I've tried several of their curry dishes. Overall this place is solid and prices are decent with the exception of their naan bread. It's $2 for one and prepackaged.  I usually still end up getting at least one (because even though it's prepackaged, they heat it up and I like garlic naan).  Got my brother hooked on this place too. You definitely should try them out!"}
{"text":"I could smell the vegetable oil burning as they warmed my Carryout Naan on the grill.  I asked for a white meat chicken option and got dark.  The naan was strange and greasy, Im not sure what I ordered wasn't frozen, it was odd and unpleasant.  I also ordered the Samosas, they seemed not so fresh.  I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Good food great service very authentic. A very up and coming restaurant just needs more customers so come check it out. 

The food is made fresh as you order. Prices are lower than normal."}
{"text":"Ambiance/Setting:  1/2 a star
Prices:  3 star
Friendliness/Service:  4 star
Food:  2 star

Came for lunch, me and the wife.  It's truly a hole in the wall (think convenience store with a small grill and 5 tables), with 6 employees to 2 diners (us).  You order at  the counter, and it is served to you on styrofoam plates and cups, with plastic forks.

The great:  Vegetable Somosas were some of best we've had, anywhere.  2 for $4.

The okay:  Entrees.  Tried a veggie curry and a lamb dish.  Veggie better.  Lamb was very fatty and who knows when cooked (clearly not that day).  Still tasty and very rich sauce that was filling.  Imagine a side salad bowl filled with your entree.  They also serve you a styrofoam plate of rice to put it over.  For $7-9 each, this seemed overpriced.  

The terrible:  Naan/breads.  First they are kinda expensive ($2 for a small 7\" round piece).  But worse, they PREMADE.  Like not by the restaurant (pulled out of plastic bag).  The piece we got tasted like it had turned/was old.  We spit out our one bite and left it untouched (this never, ever happens with us... it's like raptors feeding normally).

Everyone is very friendly though.  And it's one of those places that you therefore really wanted to love.

Verdict / Tips:  TAKEOUT.  Seriously.  And whatever you do don't get the bread.   I would seriously consider 4 somosas (2 orders), plus 1 entree, and share between two people for lunch or lighter dinner.

I work a few blocks away.  I'm really not sure I will be back, but if I did I would order just samosas and veggie dishes for takeout only."}
{"text":"The worst Briyani ever had, kept a tandoori chicken in a rice and called it as briyani waste of money. stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Best biryani in the area! This place is small, but very authentic. I haven't tried any menu items except the biryani but it is fresh and delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to try genuine biryani!"}
{"text":"Ya as far as inexpensive Indian food goes this place is not good at all, naan is like something from a package or microwaved, food is tasteless and it's a bit pricey for how bad the food is. Not worth it, drive 10 minutes north and go to the chettinaad palace way better and still fairly priced"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic, fast and nice on the wallet.  I would definitely come here again. This is a little place with about 6 tables which also sells ice cream and some groceries. Love it!!"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant. I rarely hand out 5 stars, but the food was so authentic and delicious I couldn't give it 4. 

The chicken biryani was the best I've had in a long while. The naan was great, we had the garlic and the onion. 

I forget the name now but we also had a mango drink that was incredible. 

I love indian food but am rather picky, luckily I found a joint I can regular."}
{"text":"Great delivery from Grubhub.  Came earlier than expected.  Was hot and very tasty!!  Definitely ordering from these guys again for my Indian Food cravings....THANK YOU.  Look forward to dining with you soon."}
{"text":"Take out was good!  Awesome biryani - the curry was a bit over sauced and served w/white not basmati, but overall, it is homemade and delicious!"}
{"text":"Quiet, small and unassuming place with delicious food. 
I ordered Dal Tadka, Aloo Ghobi, samosas, and naan. All were delicious. 
Next time I am in the area and want wonderful, home-cooked Indian, I'll come back to Nawaz!"}
{"text":"Firsts thing first, food is not fresh not even close to fresh. Bad ambience , people are not interested in what they are doing or serving. 
Restaurant is not exactly a restaurant, its more of grocery store with limited grocery. Bad choice .."}
{"text":"Amazing lamb biryani! Huge portion, flavorful, well-seasoned. I loved every piece of it. Reasonably priced too. The vegetable pakoras were okay- I usually like more flavor in them. And the mango lassie was good as well. I didn't expect the lassi to have a sour, non-mango taste because it didn't taste like the ones I've had before, but still good regardless."}
{"text":"This place is in a tiny strip mall next to a dialysis center. A woman and her mom greeted us warmly and were very friendly. I got chicken tikka masala and garlic naan, my mom got chicken curry and rice pudding. Both were good and very filling!

Edited to add: the rice pudding was the best we'd ever had! It was golden in color so I think Saffron, with flavors of cardamom and orange blossom topped with sliced almonds. I'd eat it everyday :)"}
{"text":"READ AND DONT EAT HERE!!! Ok this one star is actually a ZERO star! So my mom and I decided to give this place a try I'm seriously going into detail on how this experience was! We walk in my mom wants to use the rest room the lady tells me \"are you buying something\" I said \"yes\" she said \"ok cuz bathrooms are not for public\" I said \"ok well we are ordering something\" and she said \"ok what you want\" at this point I'm like WTF SERIOUSLY I say \"idk I haven't even seen the menu or even sat down\" and she said \"menu at tables\" I sit look at it and I should've just left at this point but whatever decided to still try I glance at the menu & she ask again what you want cuz I have to leave to pick up my son and I you have to pay now so I can leave then her mom could mAke the food I said idk I haven't even read the menu she comes up and says you like chicken I said yes she said ok order this! Bitch didn't even give me a chance to look or anything she made again I should've left but we were super hungry and I usually like Indian food... I order and pay then she leaves her mom there who doesn't know English at all the food comes it it had HAIR!!! FUCKEN HAIR DUDE! I point it out and she takes it back all mad as fuck not speaking English she changes it brings a new one and then we eat it but honest an hour later my stomach killed me it hurts so much as I write this review worst fucken experience ever DONT GO HERE EVER!!"}
{"text":"Went in today had the Chicken Massala and it was so delicious, will definitely come back again and recommend it to friends. Service was exceptional!"}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant. Maybe better for a carryout or home delivery. Food was awesome and quantity was sufficient for 2 people. A must try joint."}
{"text":"I'm hoping the restaurant owner can make some changes and I will be more than happy to come by again. 
I love Indian food and was looking forward to eating here with my son.  When we walked in, I noticed that the place was not clean and very dark.  Even the kitchen, which is in plain sight was not very clean. Despite the fact that it was June and 100 degrees outside, they did not have the air conditioning on.  They even had food sitting out in the warm kitchen.  I went ahead and ordered take out since I was there already and did not want to eat in a hot restaurant.  While they were preparing my order I went to the restroom, which was located in the back.  The back of the restaurant was very dirty, the bathroom looked like it had never been cleaned and there was a not so pleasant stench.  I totally lost my appetite.  I was tempted to just leave without my food but did not want to be rude.  I politely paid for my food and left.  I never ate the food because I could not stop thinking about the stench, the dirty back room and the not so clean kitchen.   If they clean up the place, I will be more than happy to give the restaurant another try."}
{"text":"Good food and quick, personal service. Ordered three dishes for three people (2 teens) and some naan and had to take a lot home for leftovers. Excellent for the price and great flavors. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"It is interesting to read through the reviews for this restaurant.  It seems that you are either going to love it or hate it.  I'm on the love side of things.  I must admit that I have been here only twice, but I felt the need to write a review because of how much I loved the chicken tikka masala.   Simply fantastic!  I have eaten at many, many Indian restaurants and this was the best I have ever had.  I agree with the naan not being good and the samosa I had was good, but not great.  Having said that, the tikka blew me away and made my experience still worthy of 5 stars.  A place like this deserves a little slack due to the nature of the business; new, owned by a couple, etc.  It certainly could be a little cleaner and slicked up, but come on, this is not why you go to a place like this.  I loved it and will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Not bad, my firat time trying it. I live next to it n see it all the time. Its a deff hole in a wall place, pretty good food , service isn't bad. If u like indian food u might wanna try it. Looks kinda iffy when u walk in cuz its like a fast food n a small market i mean small. But dont judge a book by its cover. I give it a 3 cuz presentation could be better, food is good though. Pretty fair portion i guess. Would i come bak ? Probably if i was feeln indian food n spicy in my appatite.."}
{"text":"Not to my liking. I won't be going there again. Food taste was somewhat good but they seemed old. Food seemed to have been prepared several days ago and they just heat up and serve them. The garlic naan here are just heated up bread. Not fresh at all! 
I don't need to go to a resturant and pay money to have old food. 
Plus the food was pretty expensive compared to other Indian places. Portions were super small!
There are a lot of better places to eat at around Phoenix"}
{"text":"Honestly the food here was not up to expectations at all. Interestingly enough, there's a review posted on the door of the restaurant from a local paper, probably from when the place first opened. That review gives an honest opinion of the restaurant and states that the food isn't fresh or savory. I was surprised to see the newspaper cutout literally posted on their door, but I feel like I should have taken it more seriously before choosing to dine here. 

The owners seemed friendly and well-intentioned, but the food wasn't up to standard by a long shot. The naan was clearly frozen, not fresh, and the chicken was uncooked in some places - which is not only not delicious but also a health concern. 

This might be a good stop to buy some snacks or sofa (they double as a convenience store), but I wouldn't recommend stopping here for food."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious, full of flavor. The people there are super friendly. It is a restaurant and a small grocery store. Would definitely eat there again but prefer take out."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. First time, I tried an onion dosa which was served alongside with two chutneys and Sambhar. The dosa and chutneys were good, but the sambhar was just okay. The dosa is definitely very reasonably priced and for a quick lunch, it's good. 

On my next visit, I wanted to try a vegetarian curry dish so I ordered Navratan Korma which is a medley of 9 vegetables. Some of the vegetables used were frozen which is fine considering the price; but at least thaw the vegetables properly. When I took a bite of the cauliflower, it was cold and full of water, an indication it should have been cooked longer. Anyways, I thought I will let it slide. As I got done with about 3/4 of my meal, I found a piece of hair, YES HAIR!!! eek... 

I took it up to the owner at the cash register and the lady who does majority of the cooking. They were shocked and it was obvious they were disappointed. They apologized and I kindly accepted. I offered to pay but the owner didn't accept payment for my lunch which was a nice gesture. 

I realize they have recently opened and in the beginning there are a few bumps which I am willing to be patient with. However, being in the food industry they really need to be careful. The lady who does the cooking has waist-long hair which I think needs to be tied up and secured in a hair net. I was definitely grossed out after eating an oily, frozen vegetable curry with a piece of hair in it. 

Will I go back? Maybe, after a few months when they have worked on their cooking standards.

 Also, when I was waiting on my lunch, religious music/prayer started playing all of a sudden from their ipad and it was definitely a bit awkward. We shared a few looks, I was puzzled because I thought they would turn it off, but they were looking at me, maybe for a response. But then I thought, I can always put on my headphones if its really bothering me. Shortly after, another customer entered so they turned it off. That made me think, were you not taking me seriously as a customer? Hmmm....just another thought."}
{"text":"I live right across from Nawaz. Very friendly people. Good food. Me and my fiancé love the food there."}
{"text":"Ok - by one star I'm not saying this is the worst Indian restaurant in Phoenix, amongst all restaurants I visited in  USA, I had most unpleasant experience in here. This place is unhygenic, very badly managed. Old rice was refried and given in name of Biriyani, with big bad chicken pieces inside. Very bad goat masala. Only thing tasted ok was Methu Vada. On top of all this, later that day I realized they charged more than 18% tax, although just two of us dined in.
In short - stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Nawaz is located in a small shopping center at the corner of Dunlap and 19th right past the Park N Ride parking lot. 

Came here with a co-worker on our lunch break, but since I wasn't hungry I decided to just sit and visit with her while she ate. The inside of the restaurant is small and only offers a few tables to eat at. It was clean and organized. The lady and her mom were very nice, but the mother seemed like she didn't know how to speak English. 

My co-worker did the lunch buffet which cost $12. The buffet offered only 8 different dishes. Which to me looked just like rice and all other dishes were meat. No vegetable dishes were offered. The buffet is something new that they are trying out. I believe the lady said they've only had it a week or two. They do have a menu which you can order off of if you aren't interested in the buffet. PLEASE make a note: don't taste from someone else's plate if you don't intend to do the buffet. My co-worker offered me a taste of a chicken dish and they made us buy a buffet plate! Since I am not a fan of Indian food, it was a waste for us to buy another plate. I just ended up giving it to someone else. 

The person I gave my buffet food said the food was good but very spicy with lots of Curry. So, if you aren't into spicy food this might not be the place for you to try out. 

Other then the buffet and menu food, they do have a small selection of Indian groceries you can buy from them."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday around 8:45. It's close to my apartment so I wanted to try it as I've been obsessed with Chana Masala lately. I called in and the lady on the other said answered \"hello?\" One of my biggest pet peeves is calling a business and then not stating the business' name. Taken back by the answer I asked if it was Nawaz and she said yes. I placed my order for two somosas and Chana masala. I went in and it was empty except with two ladies working. I loved the way the lady in the kitchen area was dressed because it gave the place an authentic vibe. I paid $16 for my food. Eh a little much. I didn't like the restaurant at all. It was very plain and boring and unwelcoming.
I got home and tried my food. Rice was sticky. Indian rice is not meant to be sticky. Chana masala was EXTREMELY greasy...it did not sit well with my stomach at all. It was a little sweet which I didn't like. But overall it had ok flavor. The somosas tasted like they had been sitting out for days. So old and greasy. I did not like them at all. 

Would I go here again, probably not. There are too many good options to settle for less than mediocre."}
{"text":"I went back to Nawaz because their food was so delicious the first time, I had to see if it was just a fluke. This time I drove over there myself. The appearance is basically hole in the wall. It seemed a bit sketchy, but I ordered my food to go anyway. I ordered curry chicken, palak paneer, garlic naan and rice pudding.
The curry chicken is extremely spicy hot but very good. Nice flavor. The palak paneer was spicier than I remember but also delicious. I gotta say I did not like the rice pudding. It was very liquidy and didn't have much rice in it. That was a disappointment.
Other than that I do recommend this place the food is quite good and it's cheap was just $22 for everything I ordered."}
{"text":"I was excited about trying this restaurant's food after seeing the reviews. It's pretty close to the house and the prices were fair. Well, the good stopped there.

We had the Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Vindaloo, and some naan to go and ate at home. The balance of flavors was so off we barely finished our small plates and were done. We NEVER do that with Indian food! We're always going for 2nd's and 3rd's! Tikka Masala is like crack to me. I will eat and eat until the food is gone! I couldn't believe how off this recipe was. And the Lamb had a razor sharp bone chip buried in the sauce that I ended up biting into! This is unacceptable when you're making everything from scratch!

It tasted like they weren't using fresh spices and the flavor was very earthy but in a dirty way. Not good at all. I should have noticed that there wasn't a soul in the restaurant when I went to pick it up - just the owner running the register and his wife cooking. I was the only order. You would have thought they would be happy to see me, but that's not the feeling I got. It seemed like they were in a sad mood. I hate seeing a restaurant do poorly. I hope they taste other Indian food in the area and tweak their recipes, because I will never come back when it tastes like this.

Not to mention the restaurant is filled with row after row of empty metal shelves that used to belong to a dollar store (stickers still on shelves). I have no idea what they were doing there. Must've been at least 8-10 giant shelving units.

It's sad when I can make a better tikka masala and vindaloo from home using Fresh & Easy simmer sauces. Next time when we're hankering for amazing Indian food we're not gonna mess around and go straight to Marigold Maison."}
{"text":"Not only was the food well prepared and bursting with fresh flavor but the staff was courteous and chatted with us about the food and Indian culture. As a vegetarian I was pleased to see South Indian options as well as other veggie friendly options.  I recommend the masala dosa with a side of rice and samosas. And my friend enjoyed the Lamb Curry. The prices were reasonable and I would definitely recommend giving it a try. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"They always say don't judge a book by it's cover! It might sit at the edge of the strip mall, and as you walk in it may not give you the fill of prosperity, but when the Food hits the table and the aroma tickles your noise, and the fresh, spicy East India flavor illuminate your pallet you will know your in the right place !!! I enjoyed the Goat Masala with the Paneer, and the chicken Samosa ! ALL fabulously prepared well. I shall return !!!"}
