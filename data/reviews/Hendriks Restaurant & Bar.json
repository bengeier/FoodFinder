{"text":"Turns out we were misinformed by our server. Mains are supposed to be accompanied by a side-dish. I have eaten here several times since and the service was far superior to my first visit."}
{"text":"What a great new restaurant in the heart of the city! Food is absolutely top notch ! And the wine selection is great. Service was very prompt, efficient and knowledgeable. The ambiance is stunning and music isn't crazy loud so you can still have a conversation. I would highly recommend Hendriks and will definitely be returning !"}
{"text":"Our server Olliver was amazing. Attentive without being pushy, nearby to wave over, and careful to check the quality of our food. My first Old Fashioned was too sweet, but I mentioned it to him and the second was the best Old fashioned i ever had. My whole party enjoyed the desserts and this is definitely somewhere I will be returning for small family meals as well. There regular menu is delicious, but the specials are the most exciting part-- get whatever the market fish is. You will not regret it.

Above all I have to say this is also the cleanest restaurant I've been to in Toronto. That goes a long way, as I've friends with autoimmune disorders. This is one of the few places I would be comfortable taking them to."}
{"text":"Went to Hendricks last night (a Sunday night) with my boyfriend after some shopping downtown. They were very friendly when we arrived and asked if we were seeing the show nearby, we said no. We were sat right away, as it was only 5:30, so it wasnt very busy. The new decor is nice and modern. 
We sat for 15 mins before a server approached us, and she wasnt our assigned server. Apparently our server was busy with his other one table. We order calamari to share, I got crab cakes and a water and my boyfriend got a coffee and the short ribs. The calamari was nice and crispy. My boyfriend liked his short ribs, but the mashed potatoes that came with them were bland. The crab cakes were ok, but the sauce ontop was over powering and I couldnt finish them. It was serves with french fries, which were fine, except they took up 3/4 of the plate. It looked like they were overcompensating for the small crab cakes.
In the end our bill was $85 and that was without tip. That was ridiculous for the food we got. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I definitely do not relate to some other people who have posted such positive reviews of Hendriks as my experience was pretty disappointing. 
To be clear, my disappointment is solely about my meal-  and not the service received from the staff. 

Upon arrival to the restaurant I was promptly and politely greeted by the hostess who had us seated as requested when I made our reservation. 
Once seated we were greeted by our waiter who was pleasant and professional. He quickly took our drink orders and got us waters while we waited. 

The menu at Hendriks offers a big selection of appetizers and entrees; there's something for everyone. 

Before ordering, I asked the waiter about the crab cakes and he told me that the type of crab used for these crab cakes was the best crab....so I ordered the crab cakes- which come with coleslaw and fries. 

When the food arrived, the presentation was very blah. The crab cakes were blatantly overly deep fried with a very dark crust and when my fork touched the cake I could see the grease rise up. The coleslaw was strange as it was with ?kale and not so creamy. The fries were disappointing shoestring- mostly the small fry bits that end up left on your plate AFTER you eat the good fries. 

It took a while for our waiter to check-in to see how our meals were- but when he did, I told him I was disappointed and a few minutes later the manager presented to our table to find out what my concern was. 
When I pointed out the concerns with my meal his first response was that he wished he knew about it sooner (implying that we had eaten some of the meal before complaining) but when I told him that he would have been alerted to my concern sooner had the waiter checked in with us when we received our meals, then he would have been made aware sooner. He then offered to replace my meal- which I wasn't interested in - but I did accept a complimentary dessert - cheesecake x 2 (which was very good). 

Overall I will say that for the prices they charge at Hendriks the food quality falls short."}
{"text":"Very average. Smack dab in tourist central so lots of mouth breathers from out of town. Service was good, friendly and attentive. Food was pricey and under seasoned. Roast chicken was bland but cooked well. Mashed potatoes were dry and tough, under seasoned. Cobb salad was mediocre and had non traditional ingredients in it (beans) that don't fit well. Wine list is fairly low end stuff but pricey...$$20 for a middle of the road 9oz glass. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior, tables are nicely appointed especially the window booths.  Ambiance is pleasant, quiet not too loud.  We ordered the chicken salad and cheeseburger.  Salad was a decent size but lettuce could have been fresher.  The burger, although I did not sample looked delicious and I was told tasted very good-the beef patty was thick but not dry.  They do thin fresh cut fries which is a plus. Service was prompt and efficient."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner with my wife. We were walking and noticed the nice hi tops by the big window beside the side walk.  Went in sat down at the hi top and the window was wide open pretty cool looking into the street.  We ordered drinks. My wife a chard and myself a manhattan.  The wine was very good, my wife being an oaky chard connoisseur .  The manhattan was perfect, they nailed it before I even took a drink since the glass had 1 HUGE ice cube in it so it doesn't Dilute the drink! . We ordered the grilled octopus.  It was tender but the food had black on it from the char broiler burners not setup properly and could taste the gas deposits on the octopus. I actually knew it wasn't right when it was delivered you could see the black all over it from this char broiler not burning properly.  I ordered a Laginitas on tap and it was perfect ! It came in a chilled glass and tasted great and caused me to have a couple more.  So so hard to find a bar that has chilled glasses in this big city.  These guys have the beer business figured out and I have told several people already that look for cold draft places.  We order our mains, my wife ordered the fish special and it was good. After reading the reviews I ordered the rib eye and it was absolutely delicious! Cooked perfect and the flavour and tenderness was top shelf.  The waitress was ok should of been around a lot more since the place was empty."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out for food and drinks. I had the brisket sandwich, which was a bit disappointing. The smoked meat tasted like ham. If you're a fan of thin fries though, these are pretty good."}
{"text":"Food took a while to come, we went on a Thursday evening and it was fairly busy. Tried the burgers and sandwich, pretty good. Would go again."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my tuna power bowl. I came here for lunch cause its close to work and ordered this dish. It came with big plain cucumber slices... on a bed of plain unseasoned rice. It was a huge let down. With many poke bowl places around, I'm really surprised how little thought and taste came into this dish. I'm giving it 2 stars cause the service was good. I tried my friend's chili lime corn side and that was really tasty. I cant speak for the rest of the menu but I would recommend avoiding the tuna power bowl."}
{"text":"This place was phenomenal! I would definitely come here again! I ordered Greek tacos which were to die for. Then, i had a cheeseburger which was superb! I would definitely come here again to try different items on their menu. Our waiter was so kind and the food arrived very quickly. Amazing place. I recommend"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, great atmosphere. Had a lovely date night dinner here and both me and my girlfriend can't wait to come back. Toronto's restaurant scene just got a whole lot better!"}
{"text":"I have been in Canada for a month now & this is my 3rd visit to Hendriks. With each visit I have had, the food is always amazing. The Rib Eye is seasoned to perfection and the salad has everything you need in it for it to be perfect. The ambience is a nice setting casual setting with relaxing music and the right sound of lightening in my opinion. To top it off our server Claire was delightful."}
{"text":"Hendricks has attentive servers and the food portions are very generous - their prices are reflective of that (but don't worry! You're in good hands) We went here for a team lunch and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals. The setting of the restaurant is cozy but lush with lots of booths and a great high stool bar area. 
I ordered a salad (harvest chicken) and barely could finish it. Every bite I took had a few pieces of chicken in it. My coworker ordered the fried chicken and it looked just as delicious and probably something you don't want to order if you've got important meetings in the afternoon cause it'll put you right to bed!

Definitely would return!"}
{"text":"Hendriks is a new restaurant that replaced Baton Rouge at Eaton Centre. Came here for lunch with my co-workers on a weekday.  The restaurant was pretty empty considering it was lunch time in the downtown core.  

I shared two menu items with one of my co-worker.  We ordered the Tuna Power Bowl and Brisket Ruben Fury (with fries on the side)...

Tuna Power Bowl ($20) - it is actually just like a poke bowl.  It consists of mangoes, edamame, avocado and diced tuna sashimi on top of a bed of white rice.  The rice is unlike the typical poke rice but they are seasoned which was interesting.  The portion of diced tuna sashimi could be a bit more for the price that we are paying for a poke bowl. 

Brisket Ruben Fury ($17) - it is basically a reuben sandwich with Montreal smoked meat.  The meat tasted average, nothing too exceptional.  I wish they put more gooey layers of swiss cheese in the sandwich.  They gave a fair bit of fries with the sandwich which we couldnt finish.  

All in all, I thought food was only a OK.  The items on the menu are pretty generic, there's nothing too unique that I am willing to give it another try either. Dont think I will return."}
{"text":"Nicely decorated and comfortable seating.  Servers very friendly and knowledgeable! Really like their wine selection - common favourites that you would recognize.  Meals were tasty and well prepared."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Hendriks, which is in the Eaton Centre.  It just opened in March.

I ordered a Crispy Chicken Sandwich (minus the cheese and coleslaw) with fries ... it was $18.  I'm not a big fan of fries but these were really good.  The sandwich was okay.  The bun was soft.  The chicken had a funny texture ... kind of rubbery.  The pickle was tasty.  I don't think I'd get this meal again, though.  I will say it was a large portion.

Tess was my server.  She was really friendly and helpful and took good care of me."}
{"text":"Had a lovely experience here for a 3 party birthday dinner/drinks. Service was attentive, food was hot (and crispy for deep fried items, which tasted of new oil!) And delicious. A much needed improvement in the Eaton's center culinary experience. Will be back."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife for drinks and a quick bite. Service was prompt and staff was polite. They recommended the gin and tonic which came out with cucumber. I really enjoyed it and my wife had a glass of wine the waiter recommended.

We had the chicken sandwich and NY strip-loin. Both were great, and the steak was cooked to perfection! Looking forward to coming back and trying out the tomahawk steak. We saw a group near us having it and looked awesome!

Happy to have a new spot in the downtown core to enjoy."}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto we came across the H. The appetizers were good, the waiter was extremely nice and friendly. Our 11 and 14 year old kids were with us and they loved it. Their burger, sandwich and coleslaw was great and kids loved it. The onion soup was delicious. I definitely will come back next time."}
{"text":"The ambiance is really nice for this restaurant. I wanted to sit at booth at the windows but they seated us in the middle dining area.

I ordered the baked cod and my friend got the chimchurri steak. We ordered grilled octopus to share. The grilled octopus was nice, however the beans on the side were cold, which made the octopus cool down.

The same happened with chimchurri and the steak. Cold chimchirri on hot steak which made the steak cool down rather quickly.

I would suggest the restaurant perhaps heat up the sauces etc. so it does not cool the dish.


Other than that, cod was good, steak was nicely grilled. Octopus was delicious."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Hendriks today with a girlfriend.  The ambiance of the restaurant is nice and modern but cozy.  

We both ordered the Harvest Chicken Salad (roasted chicken, avocado, roasted almonds, dates, goat cheese in a sweet citrus vinaigrette - $19).  I really enjoyed this salad (I asked for blue cheese instead of goat cheese).  The portion size was huge (for $19 it should be right?).  The dressing was light and flavourful and the salad was not overdressed.  It had just the right amount of dressing.  I was impressed with the very generous portion of chicken in this salad (practically in every bite), as well as a generous portion of all of the other ingredients.  I took half of it home to have for dinner as it was quite filling.  

The staff were very attentive - no fewer than 3 people came by our table to ask us if everything was to our liking over the course of the meal.  

This new restaurant is on the pricier side for lunch but I will be back to try more menu options."}
{"text":"Afternoon burger stop. Great looking restaurant.  Bar tender more or less unattentive,  never asked how my food was. Bartender made a terrible vodka martini. I think its something with local law? But every martini I've had in the greater Toronto area seems to be a short pour?
Nothing great about this place for lunch, other then it being a nice quiet place not far from Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here tonight with my family of 4. Terrible service, food was mediocre, would not return. 

Service was pretty lacking. Our server really wasn't listening to us or our needs. You could tell he didn't really care/wanted his shift to be over ASAP. We went just for a quick bite to eat at 9pm. 

We ordered calamari, and 3 different burgers, a chicken sandwich, and a caesar salad. The caesar is very vinegar-based, and not creamy (might be since it's eggless, but they could have perfected this recipe better). Would definitely not order the caesar unless you like soaking wet salad with heavy dressing. Menu looked promising. Did not deliver on flavour or portion size. Burgers were ok! South St Burgers are way more flavourful and half the price.

Calamari tasted like it was breaded with a more chicken savoury blend, not great. Burgers were filling but could have been better. Our server threw out our food too, even when we specified we wanted it to go. He apologized, said he'll see what he can do, and it took over 20 mins to grab his attention and figure out what was happening. Awkward that he kept walking by us, but didn't tell us what was happening? Would we get nothing? A gift card? A sorry from the manager? Just let us know so we're not sitting waiting on an update from you, when we could have left  (since we paid the bill already). 

I would not return. Atmosphere is nice though! Right beside Eaton Centre Mall!"}
