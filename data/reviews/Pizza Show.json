{"text":"Best pizza in c√¥te des neiges! The staff are all so friendly and welcoming. The pizza has the best crust and the toppings blend together so perfectly! I will never get my pizza anywhere else as long as I am here!"}
{"text":"This just replaced any Pizzeria in Cote-Des-Neiges. I try to not eat pizza often since I'm 300lbs but when I want one this is where I go :) very delicious and affordable"}
{"text":"Of all the delicious food being consumed across the globe this Ill-fated Sunday evening, it was my turn to sample the pronounced mediocrity that is Pizza Show.   The delivery took far too long, and when it arrived, I ate it quickly as I was famished. With each bite, I kept lamenting how subpar this pizza tasted. When you're hungry, your mind starts to play tricks on you. You think that maybe the next bite or next slice will taste better. No such luck. From the first bite to the last, the experience was downhill all the way.  The medium pizza I ordered was clearly smaller than the standard 12 inches. The pizza dough had no taste whatsoever, was fairly thin, and didn't hold up to the toppings. The outside crust was completely dry and almost seemed stale!? There was plenty of cheese on it since I ordered extra cheese. Nevertheless, they left out the red peppers I had ordered and paid for. The pepperoni slices were very small and scarcely sprinkled.   At least the food is inexpensive, but I would love to go back in time a few hours and order a pizza from B & M instead."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had! The crust is thin but soft, and the sauce, meat and cheese blend perfectly. The fries are nice as a side order. But really, the price is unbeatable. Cheaper than most places around the area and you get better tasting pizza. The only thing is they only deliver in the C.D.N. area. Other than that, would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys good pizza."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best 'sold-by-the-slice' pizzas in the CDN area: the dough is neither too thick (nor is it thin, much like most 'sold-by-the-slice' pizzas out there) nor is it greasy, the toppings are fresh, the cheese feels like actual cheese (unlike what may get at certain pizza pizza or double pizza joints).  My favourite is hands down the 'Tunisienne' topped with tuna, red onions and olives (i think).   Also, the staff is very welcoming and friendly.  If you're ever looking to have a quick bite while on CDN, definitely head to Pizza Show for a slice or two."}
{"text":"2.5 stars  Maybe it's just me but I'm just not a fan of their pizza. I find it to be bland and nothing special. I tried the poutine and the fries were soggy and falling apart. There was a good amount of cheese though and it was of high quality. The sauce was too salty for my liking  This is the only pizza place in my area that is open late and the people who work there are super nice. The prices are pretty good and the fact that they deliver is appreciated.  Maybe I'll try their pizza again. If I do,  I'll ask for some more spice/seasoning."}
{"text":"Last time I ordered from website everything asked was there. This time was quick and friendly. Hopefully they keep in this way."}
{"text":"La meilleure pizza du quartier. La sauce n'est pas acide, le fromage frais, la croute a une epaisseur et texture parfaite et les condiments sont frais. Je ne suis jamais allee sur place, je fais toujours livrer et le service est tres poli et courtois, livraison rapide, la pizza arrive chaude."}
