{"text":"Let me start by saying that this was my favourite spot in Oakville, or even Mississauga. I moved from Toronto a while back and anyone who came into town, this is where I brought them. The burger was literally the best in Oakville, and me & my partner ordered it so often we had it down to a science which chef cooked it that day. Intended to host my birthday in the room at the front this year, with excitement. I just spent a couple months traveling & came back to the \"new menu\", which I'm not sure if its inspired by new chefs, new owners, or a new budget. Tried six dishes to date with two others, and only one was worth ordering again (O'Beef Melt). The items that made this place have been expelled off the menu, replaced with run of the mill options. If you're going to do a classic, make it memorable. The burger was huge, bloated (so you only taste beef), more expensive, without the special touch it once had. Adding cheese and bacon brings the price tag up to $20, on par with Spencers (Burlington) and Sassafraz (Yorkville), both gourmet options. The chicken fingers were simple, the tuna app included three tiny slices of tuna, hardly worth the $15 price tag. The goat cheese app wasn't warmed and boring, and the crostini was thick and hard (should be thin slices which compliment the pairings). All in all, we've lost an incredible option here in Oakville (please bring back the old options!)...luckily the live music is still incredible, so is the scene on the weekend. Just some feedback (from a few of us) that I hope is taken seriously xo."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner while I was on  a business trip and I was very satisfied overall with this O'Finn's. Their menu advertises comfort food and thin crust pizzas, I went for a sandwich. The sandwich was very good and was served with chips. Washed every thign down with a Guinness.

The server was very friendly and the service was quick, granted it wasn't very busy. I will definitely be stopping back in when I come back."}
{"text":"First time at OFinn's and overall a good experience. Service was friendly and prompt. Onion soup was very flavourful although a bit heavy on the bread. Crab stuffed wontons were just ok. 
Chocolate pate was awesome!

Two things were a bit off-putting and hopefully just a one time thing. Saturday night and they didn't have one of the two house wines. Had a table that looked clean but was sticky to the touch.

Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Lousy, expensive food. Rude, inattentive staff and over priced drinks. And the bullish thug-like 20 year old security guards where a bit much for a restaurant. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Neigh. I'm a horse. I like salt. Love it in fact. I have a salt lick in my pen, a big block of salt that I lick regularly. So I know salt. I like salt. In fact, I love it. My experience last night at O'Finn's Irish Temper however, had me dipping my head in the water trough again and again. Why you may ask? Well, in all my years, horse years, I have never had food as salty as that which I had the pleasure of overpaying for as I did at O'Finns. Every entree ordered by everyone at the table, horse or human, was practically inedible due to the copious amount of salt ladled onto every dish. 

After a long day trotting around the track at Woodbine with midgets sitting on my back and whipping my bum, myself and my non-equine friends felt like something sinful. A platter of nachos was ordered by the table as a starter. Nobody expected a Dr. Oz veggie platter. We ordered nachos, we knew what we were getting into. A hot, cheesy, fatty, salty mess. And we were looking forward to the glutinous treat. However, what we received was nothing short of cardiac arrest inducing saltiness. The salt was caked on every tortilla chip, like freshly fallen snow on the roof of your car. Inedible would be an understatement. Have you ever driven up an on ramp on a cold January morning and seen the piles of road salt the plows leave behind to stop the black ice from forming? That is what the nachos looked like. I've seen less salt caked onto a 1996 Toyota Tercel after a winters worth of driving on the GTA highways.

Now, being the Canadian thoroughbred horse I am, my polite nature often has me finishing something with a smile whether I like it or not. But this blood pressure bomb was beyond what my Canuck manners could withstand, and I grudgingly told the waitress we could not eat this travesty. Apologetic to the point of embarrassment, I let her know that it was not good. She took it away. A short while later the real magic happened. The little twerp of a manager made his way over to our table. His passive aggressive tone was one that I have never experienced in my 40 years of dining out (those are horse years too, so well over 100 years for you two-legged humans). He jumped right to a defensive stance as if he had grown and ground the corn for the nacho chips himself, on a hectare of rocky soil, high atop a cliff on a remote hillside in Machu Picchu. It was comical. Someone has hurt this man before. Not sure who, but normal adults don't act this way out of the gate unless someone has stomped on their heart, or face, in the past. He sent out another plate of nachos (basically telling us he was doing us a favour) citing \"human error\" as the culprit. The second platter was saltier than the first.

Had someone inadvertently knocked over a bag of salt onto these in the food prep area? Had the Campbell's company mistaken O'Finn's kitchen for its soup factory and dumped a years worth of soup salt onto our nachos? Had an ancient ocean tributary dried up, and its savoury remains coalesced in a vortex of white salty dust over the top of my melted Monterrey Jack cheese they found in a No Frills parking lot? I don't know, but again, just an awful, disgusting mess was served to us, one that nobody but a person devoid of taste buds could consume. After one bite, I could feel the salt oozing out from the sweat of my armpits. 

And the main courses that followed were no better. It was like they took the Dead Sea in Israel, extracted all the water from it, and used what was left in every dish of food they served. And I think I know what they did with the water they extracted, it went into the watered down pints they passed off as beer.

So, if you find yourself in Oakville and are going into anaphylactic shock and need something salty to raise your blood pressure immediately, stop into O'Finns. If you are a lady and feel like being leered at by fat 32 year old shinny hockey players with no neck looking to pick a fight and hoping for a drunk cougar to bag for the night, drop into O'Finns. If you are tone deaf and don't mind the off key singing by the one man band with the drum machine in the Old Navy t-shirt, make a beeline into O'Finns. You won't be disappointed.

There are many places a stones throw from this place in Oakville that will happily gouge you out of your hard earned pay. Go there instead.

I'd sooner bathe in broken glass than patronize this establishment again. And to the owners, I'd have your manager take a few courses in a George Brown hospitality program night school class. He has the personality and charisma of a wet tube sock with a hole in it. I've met cigarillo sellers at cockfights that have more charm and business acumen than this guy.

I'm sorry to have rambled, but it was really that unpleasant of an experience. Luckily the company I was with was good, and we all took the experience, pardon the pun, with a grain of salt. And I must have been pretty irked to write this, because do you know how hard it is to type with hooves?"}
{"text":"Difficult to rate - here's why

We've been to O'Finn's before (upstairs) and very much enjoyed the food, the great wait staff and the musicians. 

Recently, however, I attended a Speakeasy event in the downstairs party room, which ended up being a huge disappointment and a bit of a rip-off with what you actually received (which was basically an empty bottle, some spices and a bad band), even with the discount we received on tickets. It was like paying to attend a cheap advertisement for the host's new business. While the individual hosting the event may not be associated with the pub, the pub did agree to host it, which is why I'm submitting this review, in the hopes they will see this. 

The event description was misleading in terms of what was included, and the band (and I use the term loosely) was atrocious. Some actual musical training and regular practices for all (with perhaps the exception of the stand-up bass player) are desperately needed. We were so disappointed in the event that we left after an hour. Warning: if you ever see a Speakeasy offered again here, DON'T BOTHER!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Guinness really good food good atmosphere pub is right in Downtown Oakville. Staff are friendly and professional and hardworking. Tyler and Aron the owners are hardworking making sure each guest is looked after and happy with the service and if you haven't been to O'Finns really recommend going and 3 to 6 all appetizers half off and they even do private events they have separate room that can be rented out."}
{"text":"O'Finn's has a great lunch menu, which usually includes a few specials of the day.  I highly recommend the fish and chips, but only if you have a big appetite as the portion is fairly large.  The staff is exceptionally friendly at this pub and will recognize you if you're a regular.

There is a separate bar downstairs with enough seating to host a private function.  The decor upstairs and downstairs is pretty standard for an Irish pub, but is cleaner than your usual bar scene and seems cozier as well.  

If you arrive at a peak hour, it will not be easy to find parking.  There is some parking on either side of the street and in the two lots nearby, but even all that space fills up quickly as the parking is shared with several businesses and restaurants."}
{"text":"Just got back from a night out with some friends...normally O'Finns is highly predictable....and that's a good thing, but the service and the server tonight was SLOW, uninspiring, unhelpful, and we appeared to be an annoyance...we all have bad days, just don't take it out on the paying customer..."}
{"text":"I travel for work and was looking good for a late night bite to eat. Amazing, fresh ingredients bring such a pleasant surprise to this homey comfortable Irish Pub. 

The beer glasses are chilled with every pour, the food as I mentioned, is amazing. I tried the hand-rolled taquitos, the meatball pizza and the burger with sweet potato fries. Everything was freshly prepared and delicious. 

The staff was amazing. Natalie, the bartender, was friendly and had great suggestions. She has been there a while and knows most of the locals. Kelly the server had great stories and he was very knowledge about just about everything. 

I will definitely make sure and come back to O'Finn's the next time I'm in Canada."}
{"text":"I always enjoy this place. Their menu is small and albeit expensive for... Decent portions, but the flavor is all there. I really enjoy the food here consistently. The decor and feel is really nice and overall this is a great choice to dine in downtown Oakville if you want a more relaxed atmosphere with good taps and friendly servers."}
{"text":"We had an excellent family supper here!
It wasn't too busy, the service was friendly, and the pints were fresh.

I can highly recommend the beef meatballs, longboard pizza, lemongrass beef ribs, dill battered fish and chips, and the chop house burger."}
{"text":"Nice friendly spot with good food, drinks, and good entertainment.
The guitarist did an excellent rendition of many popular songs.  The service was outstanding.  The appetizers I ordered were pretty good and not overly priced.
Nice cosy place and I look forward to trying them again... :)"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, normally I overlook pubs when it comes to choosing restaurants because their food tends to not be up to par. 

This pub proved me wrong.

It was actually recommended to me by my sister's boyfriend who is a trained chef, so I knew it was going to be good before my meal even arrived. My boyfriend and I had a Caesar salad to split, which had a wonderful homemade dressing with croutons, bacon, and Parmesan. For my entree I had the lamb shepherd's pie with a twist - the topping not only contained potatoes, but also parsnips and sweet potatoes, which added a nice sweet flavour.

The menu had a ton of other dishes I wanted to try on it, so I will definitely be going back. Soon. Like tomorrow."}
{"text":"I often go to O'Finn's for lunch and quite like it there. Nice ambiance, with a traditional Irish feel to it. Good selection of beers on tap.  My favourite dish for lunch is the grilled chicken club clubhouse. There burgers are good too as are their pizzas. The only complaint I have is that (along with some of the other reviewers) there service can be a little slow, particularly when they are busy."}
{"text":"The worst nachos I've ever had. A pile of nacho chips with ground beef and a bit of cheese, a very small amount of sour cream and a HUGE amount of shredded iceberg lettuce on top. We asked for more sour cream but they said they ran out . There were only a few customers there at the time. The waitress was extremely friendly but that's about the only good thing I can say. I would never go there again"}
{"text":"Just tried O'Finn's Irish Temper out last night, and I'm impressed. The prices are a bit steeper than I'd like, but the food was excellent, and so was the ambiance of the restaurant. 

My partner and I started out with the pretzel crusted chicken wings with the mild sauce, which I could have sworn were called double crusted on the menu, not pretzel crusted, but hey, it's a bit dark in there. The wings were fantastic, sweet and spicy and perfect. I would go back for these wings. They came with some veggie sticks and blue cheese dressing, both of which were great.

For our meals, I ordered the fish and chips, while my partner ordered the bangers and mash. My meal was great. The fish was delicious, flakey, tender, and the tarter sauce was very good. The chips were crispy and delicious. I'm not really a coleslaw person, but the bit I had of the coleslaw that came with the meal was quite lovely.

My partner thought the bangers and mash were just \"alright.\" I, myself, do not like sausage, so I wouldn't think much of it, but he said the sauces that came with it were \"confusing\" to his palate. He did eat the meal, however, and he liked my fish when he tried it.

The atmosphere is very chocolate brown, slightly dark, and can be loud from the drinking crowd (what, people drinking in an Irish pub?), but we didn't mind. There was a nice fire going, and the whole establishment seemed upscale and lovely. The chairs were very sturdy for a large bottom, something I quite appreciate. :)

Overall, I liked it very much. The waitress was very nice and professional, and the look was fab, as was most of the food. I would definitely go here again!"}
