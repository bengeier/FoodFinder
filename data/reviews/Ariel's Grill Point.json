{"text":"We went for the first time, excited that we saw it had Russian and Middle Eastern food...we were 1)surprised at no lunch specials/menu; 2) the prices (kebab combos 14-17); and 3) the food.  Only thing we liked was the hummus, which comes with bread for $6....very good flavor.  We got the chicken kebabs, which were so fatty and poorly cooked, we didn't eat - awful.  They come with \"garlic fries\" which are limp strange potato pieces but they are garlicky!  The accompanying salad of onion/cuke/tomato was Ok.  The combination of cost and the fact that we couldn't eat either the chicken or fries means we won't be going back.  It IS Kosher, if that's what you are seeking.  Too bad....if they regroup and offer a lunch menu, it might work."}
{"text":"Today I was trying for the first time the new kosher restaurant , The true it was surprising ,really good. Tue meat was good , the salad have really good home dressing .For sure I will be beck again."}

If your experience is similar to mine it is highly possible that you will experience ************************************* a LANGUAGE BARRIER.***********************************************

According to the hours posted we arrived about an hour after they were supposed to be open. We saw a woman outside smoking a cigarette and didn't know she might be the owner. We go up to the door and she darts over so my husband opens the door for her. 
SHE DOESN\"T SAY ANYTHING.
SHE DOESN\"T MAKE EYE CONTACT. 
SHE ACTS LIKE WE ARE INVISIBLE.

I say real loud, \"HELLO, ARE YOU OPEN FOR BUSSINESS?\"

The woman and I noticed a Babuska (maybe a grandmother) sitting in the restaurant. Both women looked down and didn't make any eye contact with us. It seemed like they didn't want us to be there.

Next a young man comes out. 

HE SPEAKS!

He says, \"What do you want?\"

My husband says, \"We don't know we never were here before.\"

Young man, \"Our cook isn't here yet, we can only serve soup and salad.\"

I say, \"When will your cook be here?\"

The young man says nothing and just looks at us .....................................................

I say, \"we'll come back another time.\"

Crickets.................................................................................................................................just a blank look from the young man.

No Thank you for coming
No Hope to see you again
Just nothing....

It seemed like we were an inconvenience and weren't welcomed as guest.

I know that this is a new business and they don't have things together yet....But in any business you have to treat the customer with small amount of respect. Also any problem a business has can be overlooked with sincere communication.
Two stars means I've had better. I don't think it ok (ok equals 3 stars) to treat guest this way so that is how I awarded 2 stars."}

{"text":"This place is a Russian/Mediterranean resturant. We were 6 people, a family. We started off with a round bread cut into 6-8 pieces. It was kind of toastyish/grilledish. It was very good and was especially yummy to dunk in our beef logman soup. The logman soup was a hearty steaming, vegetable filled soup with a beefy and tomato flavor. The vegetables in it were green beans, tomatoes, potatoes, and parsley. The parsley made it taste fresh and traditional (my favorite part). Although the amount of beef in it was not a lot (just some small beef chunks) the soup tasted traditional and the spicy taste was very pleasing to the senses. After the beef soup two of us chose the chicken kabab plate with garlic fries and the tomato and cucumber salad and four of us chose the lamb kabab plate with the garlic fries and tomato and cucumber salad. We should have gotten rice as they wrote on the menu but they were out of it. From what it looked like though they compensated by giving us more fries and onions. I was one that ordered the beef plate. It came with the 2 kebabs that had onions and some dill sprinkled a on the meat the garlic fries were good, however I didn't really taste the garlic. The fries were the perfect size and also looked like they cooked it with some dill and garlic mixture. The tomato and cucumber salad had onions in it and the dressing was salt, and maybe some pepper. The salad had dill which added to the freshness. I liked that it was fresh and free of any heavy oils or vinegar. But they were big slices of tomato and cucumber which was fine but I thought they would be smaller. The lamb kebabs were delicious! Cooked and crisp in some areas on the outside but meaty and juicy on the inside. They were big chunks which i liked a lot! I tried the chicken which personally I didn't like but my family thought tasted very good and succulent. Overall the portions were good for adults and children. I docked off one star because the table was set at each place and it was weird because there were watercups there but they brought water in different cups so the table was crowded with unnecessary plates and cups although they took the extra cups they didn't take the plates. Also I thought the salad would be more salad-like even if it did taste good. Overall the experience was very nice and everything was clean and traditional. The food was great and we even tipped our server."}
