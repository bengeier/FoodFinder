{"text":"This place had really good food. There sandwiches and burgers were amazing. Everything here tasted just phenomenal. I would recommend this place to anybody that is near here. I also recommend to call in before you come because it took 30 minutes for it to be ready."}
{"text":"Loooove the chicken sandwich! Always fresh chicken grilled to perfection. And to add their special sauce + hot sauce on it is just amazing. I've also tried the burger and hot dog sandwich- both very fresh and good but the chicken beats it all. They use only high quality meats, bread and all that. Been coming here for years!"}
{"text":"Great quality, awesome taste. Its so yummmmmmy  I ordered by phone, when I was there, it was ready. No waiting time at all"}
{"text":"Burgers are just mediocre but I have to admit they are quite large. Don't expect anything like a proper burger joint though, far from it. I like their Persian specialties like ox tounge or \"Bandari\" sausage much better. Forget the fries, cheap frozen fries straight out of a bag and into your plate. During the past 3 years that I have visited this place maybe once every six months I could noticeably see the decline of passion that goes into their work. And the worst part: they would charge you a hefty surplus if you pay by credit card. My order was for 35 Dollars last time for a couple of sandwiches, they didn't say a word when I said I'd pay by credit and once I got the terminal to use my card: they had keyed in close to 41 Dollars!!! when confronted, they said it's taxes!!! close to 20% unannounced surcharge, I mean seriously?? apparently that was \"cash\" price. You don't need to have a doctorate to see what is going on."}
{"text":"Just left the place. Awful experience! Worst food ever! Angry chef! Exhausted staff! And awful food!  They are not hygiene at all. The so called chef just cleaned his noise with his bare hand and didn't even bother to clean his hand before touching my food right in front of eyes! I have real food hygienic concerns for this place! Awful experience! Will never go back!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan now. I've gone on a burger hunt in the city as of late, nothing comes close to the burger here which I find amazing. It's fresh and you can taste it. Add the garlic sauce and parsley as toppings also the Persian pomegranate non-alcoholic beer goes down perfect with it."}
{"text":"We waited a long time four food.  Almost an hour.  The staff apologized 3 times for the delay.  They were unusually busy.  Didn't seem like it but I'll have to take their word for it.  Our burgers were good though.  Nice and fresh. If I ever go back, will call in our order early."}
{"text":"I'd never seen any burgers served so HUGE in Toronto ever before. This place takes the cake....NO!.....THE ENTIRE CAKESHOP FOR THAT!  First of all the atmosphere inside the store is very calm, relaxing and clean with an open range kitchen where you can see your burgers cooked in front of you, fresh.  If you don't have the time to see your burgers made, you can always sit down in their comfortable chairs and use their free wi-fi internet by asking them for the password.   The only 2 problems I have with this restaurant is that the burgers or sandwiches that you get aren't the same price as MickeyD's is offering and that you can expect to pay around $10 to 20 for a burger combo but the PRICE IS WORTH IT as they make their BURGERS FRESH daily and not factory frozen with \"artificial meat\" and Ammonia inside it like MickeyD's does.   Also, this place doesn't offer any alcohol as management is very strict about it but that's okay because they want to make this a family-friendly environment and I am okay with that.   So if you ever want to have a relaxing day and want to try a place where you food is prepared fresh right in front of your own eyes, then Chef burger is the place to go."}
{"text":"Amazing Persian sandwiches !!!!! The owner was a head nurse in Iran; ther for the cleanliness of the place is superb! All fresh ingredients, truly tastes like my mothers cooking !!!!! Highly recommend for all Persians to come here !!!!"}
{"text":"Everytime I've come here the burgers are amazing so is the chicken breast. Freshly made."}
{"text":"Wow! I had heard a lot of great things about this restaurant, and my high expectation was not disappointed! Located in the same plaza as my brother's Orthodontist office, I decided to give it a try.   The other post does a great job to explain the feel of the restaurant (mom and pop feel, wifi), so I will just also confirm: 1) the service was great - the lady (who I think was the owner) was very friendly 2) the burgers were delicious - freshly made beef, buns, and toppings. My girlfriend had the small, and I had the chef burger and both were quite large.  What I really liked was that we didn't feel 'gross' and guilty after the burgers. They hit the spot and left us feeling full, satisfied, and not heavy."}
{"text":"Have been a customer for 3 years. During these years, Chef Burger has truly preserved its quality of service and reasonable prices. They provide you with filling, healthy, and delicious gourmet sandwiches; great combinations of superb qualities which make this restaurant one of the best go-to places in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"After a pretty significant biatus (burger-hiatus), I managed to work in some post-holidays burgasm goodness on New Years Day. Chef Burger has been taunting me for ages (my girlfriend lives right near it, and I always drive by it), and I just couldn't take it anymore.  This place has a real 'mom and pop' vibe to it. There are plenty of tables inside (with abnormally comfortable seats I might add), and a TV/MP3 corner spitting out entertainment. They also offer free Wifi.  They offer standard burgers, quarter pounders, and 2 monsters, the Super and the Chef Burger, and I ordered one of each monster.  The topping selection can't be beat. They'll even throw in quality items like mushrooms for a small fee. I couldn't recgonize one of their condiments, and inquired. The extremely friendly gentleman preparing the burgers (perhaps the owner?) told me it's their own sauce, which was basically mayo with additional herbs and whatnot to give it its own unique flavour. He seemed pretty proud of the stuff, so I had him throw that on the burgers.  These patties were huge! Another thing I really liked about this place (unlike joints like Wimpys), is that they have their own custom buns to accomodate their huge freakshow patties, and don't just let patty hang out the sides of standard buns, like some fat guy in tiny jeans. They'll also toast the buns as well, which is cool.  The prices weren't too bad given the amount of burger you receive. My Chef Burger and Super Burger came to around 15 bucks if I'm not mistaken.  As for the burgers themselves, the buns were fresh, and the burgers were perfectly cooked and tasty. The special sauce wasn't too shabby either. It reminded me a little of the sauce they put on the burgers at Licks, and that's not a bad thing.  Thanks for knocking me off the wagon, Chef Burger. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Love their Chef burger. everything about their food is awesome. their service is good but when they are busy it can take 20-30 min for you sandwich to get ready. will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Youve got to be kidding me with this place.   This used to be a good place with great burgers and sandwiches, specially maghz o zaboon. But that was years ago.   The food is completely shit now, & i heard the owner or whatever with the mustache is a piece of shit whos rude to customers.   Our salon ordered some kotlet sandwiches and cheeseburgers from here on a saturday..  the kotlet tasted like cardboard first of all, and it hard and chalky breakable(picture posted) ..what the hell?  My burger was burnt, the patty was not only literally black but i literally tasted bitterness of it being burnt in my mouth. Ew.   I called in to complain about this load of garbage they fed us .. & a man who wasnt the one who made and gave our food was like \"OMG THEY GAVE H KOTLET?!? NO THEY WERENT SUPPOSED TO SELL YOU KOTLET!!! THEYRE FROM YESTERDAY IM SO SORRY!\"  ...   Youre lucky  i didnt come backhand the dog shit who decided it was a good idea to sell that shit to a salon who makes big orders for lunch every week.   fkin ridiculous. Jamesh konin lotfan."}
{"text":"My Persian friend recommended this restaurant. Their sandwiches are huge. Their burgers are huge, fresh, and home made. I suggest that you try their Persian sandwiches. If you are feeling adventurous try their tongue sandwiches!!. Free WiFi."}
{"text":"Please please please visit this place once. You'll be hooked!  I've only had their chef burger (the smaller one because the regular is too big for me to finish) and I've loved it enough to go back whenever I want a burger.   This is the best burger I've had in a long time and recommend it to everyone. The patty is made right in from of you so you know it's the real deal. The sauce they use is also incredible!  You're welcome, in advance :)"}
{"text":"Not a basic burger joint.  This middle eastern establishment is more a sandwich shop.  Some unique sandwich items such as lamb tongue.  I got a burger, which was made fresh, but not sure on the cut of beef, had a gamey taste to it, maybe I got tongue.  Not cheap either.  $8.50 for just the burger.  Another $3 if you want fries, which I did not partake."}
{"text":"Checked this place out after friends insisted that I try it out.  Well, I have to say I'm hooked!  The burger isn't your typical craft burger so don't go in expecting a Burger's Priest but somehow, it manages to hit the right spots! The quality is good and even better than burger is the Tongue Sandwich, not too greasy, done just right and a generous portion too.  If the food doesn't set this place apart already, the ambience and especially the dude who runs the place, definitely do! I love how the guy still takes the orders with Pen and Pencil, writing them down on a desktop agenda.  Overall if you're open to trying a slightly different burger style, Chef Burger is worth your while. It's highly likely you will get hooked!"}
{"text":"I am still in shock that I have not heard of this resto before. I'm always in the area and looking for a really good home made burger and end up driving a bit to find one.  Now that I've found Chef Burger, believe me I'll be there at least once a week. This place is conveniently located in a plaza on Yonge St and is very clean, which for me is important. The establishment is not that big, but big enough, and its spacious as opposed to many other similar restos I see that cram tables and chairs where there is no space.  I ordered the $9, 9oz burger, and dayum was it huge. I have never seen a burger that big anywhere around here. I'm not kidding, go see for yourself!  Patties are made fresh on site, buns are baked fresh on site daily. The condiments and toppings were fresh as well (which I find is rare since most places have them sitting out most of the day).  This burger had flavour, the bun was just the right density (I opted for a whole wheat bun), and covered in black and white sesame seeds. This burger is right up there among the best in the area.  I'll definitely be going back to try other menu items, but I can see that 9oz burger being a weekly staple of mine. If you love burgers, give this joint a shot and let me know what you think!"}
{"text":"Went with my son yesterday as he wanted to get their burger. The honest review is that it is an earnest, hard working shop that likely needs to  compensate higher rent with disproportionate pricing. For example, 2 small burgers, fries and two soft drinks for 23.00 tax inclusive. That is a tidy sum for thick bread straight out of the bag, and a tiny burnt disc for the meat. However, I would always recommend local businesses so please give them a shot, just don't expect the value and quality you would likely get across the street @ Harvey's."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Once again, it was the weekend and I came to the nearby library to study. I was actually planning to go to Yummi's hamburger for lunch but for some reason I couldn't find it. Instead I went to this burger joint instead. I'm full and my stomach and satisfied, but that's about it.   I think this is a family own business. The decor is nice, clean, friendly. The menu is really small. They have a few burgers ranging in different sizes, a few sandwiches, and a few sides I think as well. Today I ordered the chef burger (7-8 oz patty) and fries. They don't have a combo deal here, so you got to order everything separately. My meal came out to be 13 bucks today.   The burger first of all was dry and not seasoned. I think I could've got a better burger anywhere else. They ALMOST didn't toast my bun either. I really don't like eating a hot and cold hamburger. The person making my burger said it came out of the oven I think but it definitely didn't look toasted and hot from where I was standing. I asked him if he could toast it for me and he did. There are a basic selection of veggies, and sauces you would see on a regular burger you get at home or a family BBQ. I don't usually go out and eat for places like this.   The fries were probably the worst. Not crispy, and they also forgot about my order (I had to remind them I ordered fries). They were not seasoned at all, so I had to bring out the salt shaker. Even if I tried, I couldn't find a compliment for the fries. Eventually it got so bad that I had to take out the ketchup (I usually don't like using ketchup) and dip the fries in it so that I could get a change in flavour.   I think lack of passion is the problem with this place. Food is a business but just like everything else in life, you need to be passionate about what you do. In fact, in a customer-oriented business like a restaurant, lack of passion really reflects in the quality of service and FOOD most importantly.   If I wanted this kind of burger I could've just made it at home by myself with some patties from Costco and some store bought sauces. I didn't have to bike 20 minutes to go there. Anyways, unless they're willing to make a change in the near future I'm not planning to come back.  You can give this place a shot, but I warned you."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. The owner was nice enough and the place clean with good seating.  It wasn't a bad burger, just nothing special. Burger was well presented and looked very tasty, but it just didn't get there. Also, the fries were store bought frozen I think, but if not then tasteless enough to have been."}
{"text":"Came in and ordered a chef burger, fries and pop to go. The service here is little to none. The man double charged me for a pop and I didn't bother to mention it to him. Service is cold borderline uncomfortable.  The place is clean, which I do appreciate.  But if the service is poor, then your burgers must be out of this world. Sadly it was just a normal homemade burger, with loads of garlic mayo type of sauce. The fries were good.  Nothing worth repeating for."}
{"text":"I love this burger place! Fresh ingredients and they cook the chicken and meat only once you order. It's hard to find a fast food burger that is healthy like this these days! I've been here about 10 times and it has never disappointed!"}
{"text":"The owner is very aggressive and mean with his employees, not going to eat at this place anymore!"}
{"text":"I was their customer for their good food since the beginning although the owner is not the friendliest person. I didn't mind that until the last time I was there they gave us a very spicy sandwich and refused to accept it was spicy. It because worse when the guy offered to give us bananas to soothe the heat!!! while we were having sandwiches. Then to make things worse, he took a spoon, came and started searching my sandwich for pepper pieces!!!! I had never ever seen anything like this anywhere even at the least prestigious restaurants. I'm still shocked at what I saw!"}
{"text":"Oh My Gosh! No wonder this place is on the list of must-visit places in Toronto. I was visiting Toronto and asked a couple of friends who had visited Toronto to recommend places the enjoyed visiting and they both said make sure visit Chef Burger. I am not even a burger persor but their recommendations were so strong I could not ignore. And I am so glad I didn't. Oh my goodness! Homemade burgers and sandwiches at unbelievable prices to die for! DELICIOUS! My mouth is watering as I write this review. What a well-kept secret! I highly recommend this place. The food is fresh, delicious and well-made and the prices are very reasonable. Go and try it. You would not regret!"}
{"text":"3.5 Star  Best Homemade Burger in Town?  Maybe not the best of the best but it is up there if you want freshly grounded in house burger and cooks on a grill instead of flat top, looks no further!  Chef Burger ($7.99) in a whole wheat bun topped with a Special garlicky sauce was A-OK.  I could suggest less toppings and sauces because one can barely taste the meat itself.  Maybe next time I will try a Iranian Sandwiches: Beef or Lamb Tongue or even a Bandari!"}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan since day 1! the owners are such sweethearts! the food is DELICIOUS!:D making me crave right now. its soooooo worth it all. i'd highly recommend you try the sandwiches and burgers here. try the : bandari sandwich (spicy) and the hot dog sandwich. but every food is to die for here! 10/10"}
