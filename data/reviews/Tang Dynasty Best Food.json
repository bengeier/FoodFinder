{"text":"This place is always busy. 3 to 5 dish family combos seem more popular here than individual dishes.  Food: 2/5 Bland. Rushed. Service: 3/5 Slow. Call ahead. Environment: N/A Food court. Washrooms: N/A Mall washrooms available. Worth it?: 3/5 Cheap and sub par.  This place looks busy Everytime I have passed by. There is always a stack of take out order ready to go. With this much business I figured I would give it a try.  I was surprised to see this place only had 2.5 stars on Yelp at first but after eating I can see why. We were just stopping by so we hadn't order ahead. I would really recommend it if you plan to stop by. We waited 30 minutes for 2 things. The kitchen seems to be backed up despite everyone back there working non stop.   We decided to get 1 order of the Cantonese fried noodles. It came out steaming hot but was overly soup and the noodles hardly seemed fried. Bland overall. Definitely not something to get from here The other thing we had was the fried rice noodles with beef. Although better than the other dish, it was sub par.   I think this place is mainly for family combos of some sort. I haven't tried it and I am not sure if will after the last visit.   P.S there was a random piece of lettuce on their sign last time I was there. I wonder if it is still there."}
{"text":"Terrible service, and I'm saying that as a Chinese person from Hong Kong so I know what to expect at the standard place. I order a fish fillet with rice, and they said it would take 20 minutes...  Which already seems long for fried fish. So 30 min in I ask them if it's ready, they go \"I told you to wait. I told you it'd take long.\" so now it's 45 min and I'm still waiting.  Definitely will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"Food is sub par.... when asking for a few napkins, she actually wanted to charge me 25 cents... Really?!!  Cashier's attitude is very rude... Like she couldn't be bothered .... Wow!  If you are in the mood for subpar food, sucky service, attitude and abuse ..... this is the place to go  Hahaha"}
{"text":"Decided to come to Tang Dynasty Best Food to order a Fried spicy pork chop rice box for lunch today. About 5 minutes later, I received my order and started eating. I noticed the pork chop and also the rice was cold. Went up to the counter to tell them the food was cold and they remade it.  The Fried pork was not spicy at all.  Don't think i will be coming back anytime soon"}
{"text":"As with my two previous reviews, the quality of food here is still a steal for its price! The only reason why I'm dropping my rating is because of the ridiculous wait time.  Even on weekday nights (like today which is a Monday), they get an insane amount of takeout orders starting at 5:30-6 and I had to wait a total of 50 minutes to get my food... That's way too long of a wait for me for food court food."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre - but the customer service here is soooooo bad.  I understand they are busy but they have a responsibility to give basic customer service. I've been to tons of Chinese places - I know not to expect friendly service - but this is one of the worst where they can't even get the food out on time.  The lady who always works there is extremely cold and is not friendly at all.   I went last weekend, and there was a new older lady working at the front. She was soooo disorganized and confused. She would look at the small piece of paper (with the order I'm assuming) 20 times in one minute. She is not old enough to have alzheimer's so I don't understand what was sooo hard when packing up one order.  So we stood in front of her while she was packing up the food - we were patient maybe over 10 minutes. No one else was in front of us. We were not even sure if she was the one taking orders. Then these Chinese people come and order and she takes their money. We were like \"Uhh hello? Can we order?\" Then she calls over the regular lady worker who usually works at the front - and get this - this lady goes \"WHAT YOU WANT?\"   I guess I was the only one who took offense but my husband let that slide and ordered as usual.  After an hour wait, my husband had to ask them about it - I dunno if it was forgotten or what. This is the second time our food took over an hour!!!   I understand if they are busy, but they should warn us when we order that it will take longer than usual.  What angers me is even if you order in English, they still announce the food dishes in Chinese nor do they give an order number - so how the hell can we know what is ours?  NEVER COMING BACK HERE EVER!!!"}
{"text":"Bland cantonese food court stuff. I'm giving it three stars because of the menu variety and large portions."}
{"text":"Service is curt and indifferent.  Make sure you know what your ordering otherwise you will be met with indifference.  Basically, they know they're a big gig in the food court and they don't care if they have your business or not.  I've seen people order by the big box here to contain all the takeout orders.  The food is cheap, I'll give them that.  But it's not very good, it's ok at best.  I got the fried porkchop with spicy garlic and the batter looked very homemade (as in I could make this at home and it's not that good, homemade).  It was greasy but for $5.99 plus tax don't expect much."}
{"text":"This is food court food, not a restaurant.    The taste is very good, and also their price.  It's my favourite \"take out' place, BUT the wait time is getting longer and longer... So I usually call them ahead to place my order.   So many different combos you can choose from.  Love their Ribs with Thousand Island Sauce, Fish Fillet with Sweet Corn Sauce, any type of half chicken, so yummy~~!!!  For two of us, we usually order two dishes combo, which comes with rice, soup or soy milk.  I always can't get their soup..... hmm... only once in the past (and it tastes good, too.)  The two dishes combo is good for our dinner, AND we can pack our lunches for next day~!  **NO MSG, and it's true~  I don't feel thirsty afterwards~!"}
{"text":"Lots of people lining up on Sunday. From the time we started lining up to the time we finally begun eating, it took a total of half hour. This is the most popular place in the food court.   Most people are returning customers who live around the area. Mostly Cantonese speaking customers.   Our preference is salty and spicy dishes, so this store is too healthy for us. Nothing makes this place stands out from other food court stalls. Very light in flavour, traditional Cantonese style food. Made to order."}
{"text":"Ordering Chinese food take out is pretty much a standard way of eating when one lives in Markham/Scarborough/Richmond Hill.  Don't have time to cook?  Just go to any one of a gazillion take out places in the area and you are good to go.  Chinese food court stalls are a dime a dozen in this part of town, so if one is busy then they must be doing something right.  Tang Dynasty is a Cantonese style take out place that is located in the New Kennedy Square food court.  It tends to be the busiest in the mall as we go there sometimes to order the family style dinner for 3, 4 etc..where you pick and choose from a list of dishes that you mix and match.  Its not a place where you want to impress a date but the food is pretty good value as the food is not too greasy or oily compared to other place.  The wait time like some other reviewers have said can be pretty long (an hour or so during rush) so do either call ahead or do some shopping in the area."}
{"text":"My wife wanted to eat at this food court and I decided to get something from Tang Dynasty. I got the sweet and sour pork on rice. Really good price (5.50$ before tax). Waited a bit under 10 minutes for the food. Good portion ( I brought some home for next day lunch). The food was actually tasty and well cooked."}
{"text":"Rating is 3.5. Food is bang for buck with big portions and fair pricing. Service can be quite long, so call ahead during peak meal times. Be prepared to wait an additional 10-20 mins on top of the pick up time quoted to you. It's the same lady that always handles the phone and cash. She's kind of a grouch, but at least she's efficient lol. My in-laws have ordered traditional family combos here for years and we've ordered party trays for events. No issues besides the wait times."}
{"text":"This is one of the more popular food stalls at the food court here at new Kennedy square. They advertise \"no msg\" however I do not know if it's true or not as most Chinese places use msg. I usually order their crispy chicken, homestyle fried vermicelli, pan fried rice noodle with beef as those are my favourites. This place is extremely popular so expect to wait at least 20 mins for your food, but the prices and taste make it worth it.   Tip: call them to preorder."}
{"text":"Great taste and value - definitely on my list for takeout in a hurry!   If you're looking for a quick bite to eat while running errands or what not,  I'd definitely recommend this place. They have practically everything under the Chinese sun on their menu and it's all at a very reasonable price. They have enough 'wok air' and the portions are generous.   I particularly enjoyed their bitter melon and beef and their curry beef."}
{"text":"2.5 star  Tang Dynasty Best Food is not best food and should I be surprise?!  ?????Tau Tan Noodle ($4.50) which supposed to be the house special was nothing special at all. Lack any spiciness or that nutty flavour. The noodle was soggy and without texture.  Maybe other items on the menu are more well prepared?   I am not sure? And I probably won't be back."}
