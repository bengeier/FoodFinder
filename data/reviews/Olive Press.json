{"text":"This restaurant with first impressions seems quite promising, the decor is nice and elevates the whole place. This place has mediocre, bland food and slow, dis functional service. The staff are nice, however, are so slow and will never check on your table. I ordered a pasta Alfredo and was disappointed to receive flavourless noodles and water downed sauce. I would not recommend this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow (but friendly) and portions huge.  Spaghetti and meatballs was very good but spaghetti primavera not a lot of taste and pasta was over cooked.  This is very busy place so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"I've been to Olive Press a few times, and not particularly impressed by it. It's not bad, but also not great.  It's perhaps just a small step beyond an East Side Mario's or other similar type of chain of Italian-style food.  The portions are decent and it is definitely kid-friendly, so it has this going for it. I think I *might* return there if I happened to be up that way again, with a car full of a hungry family, but would not make an effort to make my way there again."}
{"text":"This place is refreshing as an Italian restaurant in the suburbs. The food is fresh and delicious, the decor is beautiful, the staff is friendly, and the service is great! Fresh bread is provided to the table with olive oil and balsamic, but don't make the mistake of filling up on it like I did. We had the calamari and nachos as appetizers. The calamari was good, but the nachos were amazing! I have never had nachos quite like this, with an Italian spin. I had the Pappardelle Carbonera, and my boyfriend had the Sicilian pizza. Both were fresh and delicious, and the serving sizes were more than enough for us...we were able to take some home for lunch the following day. I would definitely recommend this restaurant, especially over the other Italian restaurants in Oakville and Mississauga."}
{"text":"We've given this place many chances but the in the end they just come up short.  Food is basic,  and with exception of the Honeymoon Seafood pasta, overpriced and nothing special.  I get the feeling everything is from a standard recipe that kids put together.  Note that if you want takeout, for some inexplicable reason they will not let you order a small Caesar salad, just  a Large..lol.   In additon, you cannot order the Honeymoon pasta as a takeout dish, just eat.-in.    Location is great and possibly due to the lack of Italian restaurants in the area this place is very busy."}
{"text":"I am a close by neighbour to this place. they have improved their service over the years.  I love their food, it's always busy ."}
{"text":"We went to the Olive Press for a late mid-week lunch, and had a very positive experience. They have some excellent lunch specials, along with drinks specials. My partner had the spaghetti meatball with Caesar salad. He felt the sauce was just OK, but really enjoyed the meatball. The Caesar salad was fine. I had the meat market pizza, which was great. The lunch size portion is perfect. I also had the basil Italian wedding soup, which really wasn't anything to write home about but wasn't terrible, either. Overall, the bill came to just $40 including tax for two lunches and two beers and two espressos. The service was friendly and attentive, ambience pleasant, and unlike other reviewers, we did not encounter any screaming children. It probably helped that we chose to dine at what is traditionally considered to be nap time. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My extended family has gathered here for a meal for various sad and happy occasions.  Advance reservations made it easy to seat us all without delay.  Ambience has always been 'just right'... festive with upbeat service when we wanted to be happy and celebratory; private and quiet when we were gathering because of a sad event.   Food choices were wide enough to please all fussy palates. Quality and quantity of food exceeded expectations.   Everyone enjoyed their orders and left with pleasantly full bellies.  Prices were mid-range and there were enough choices for all budgets."}
{"text":"Amazing! Very good quality food! Reasonably priced. Fast on takeout orders too. I've had every salad on their menu and I've never gotten a bad piece of lettuce. That may sound strange but for those who eat salads out daily as I do it's common to find gross, wilted occasionally dark slimy pieces of lettuce in your salad. Not at The Olive Press. They really actually CARE about the quality of the food that they serve."}
{"text":"The decor and ambiance is nice but my husband and I found the food to lack flavour.... Calamari lacked any salt or flavour..... Hoping that it was just a one off night bc it was pretty busy and we were in a big group, but not really looking forward to trying it out again. And comparing the experiences of other friends, it's been on and off, which is disappointing....but seems consistent with our experience."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant in Oakville.  It's got lots of open space and yet a very warm atmosphere.  Good service.  I think the pastas are homemade in-house.  You can taste the freshness. The ingredients are simple and flavourful. I don't really suggest the popular pasta dishes like spaghetti and meatballs or lasagna. Favourites are the mushroom ravioli and pappardelle carbonara.  I enjoyed a belleni too.  They don't take reservations for small groups, but if you get there early enough, it's not a problem.  The restaurant can get very busy, even weeknights."}
{"text":"We took my son and his girlfriend there just last week - our first time there - and loved it !  Quality and portions of food were very very good ...as was the ambiance and service. The place was packed. Same prices as a East Sides or a Kelsey's but the food quality and portion size is better IMO.  Actually, we'd tried to go for dinner the previous Friday evening but there was a 1 hour wait to get in....so it seems to be a hit of sorts.  Highly Recommended !"}
{"text":"I often get the salmon dish here- nice size and great potatoes and grilled veggies. Pizzas and Stromboli's are also pretty good- I find good crust and quality ingredients.   A bit pricey but a great alternative to the typical franchises in the area, like east side Marios etc..   The only pizza place in the area I think is better is Peppino's. But olive press is better in terms of overall Italian style dishes."}
{"text":"Food was satisfactory.  Snowy day, walk way was not clear.  Took forever to take drink order.  No crayons on table for kids.  They ended up giving us free tiramisu because cappuccino order wait was so long.  Waitress was pleasant."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable meal. Had the warm olives as an appetizer. Huge portions. Had spaghetti and meatballs as a main. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We decided to finally try this restaurant after wondering about it for so long. We arrived around 5pm on a Saturday afternoon, and the place filled up very quickly after we sat down.  We had the calamari fritti and the garlic white pizza for starters, both were very tasty. For our main dish, I had the chicken milano with shrimp and my boyfriend chose the spicy penne puttanesca. I really enjoyed the chicken milano, although my boyfriend found the omission of seafood in the penne puttanesca  an unusual (and somewhat unexpected!) departure from the traditional recipe.  The service was prompt and friendly and all in all, we had a pretty enjoyable meal. I'm sure we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Took a few guests there from Montreal and everyone was very impressed. The food was excellent, the service was great and the atmosphere is really nice. Looks and feels like a nice franchise like Jack Astor's, Boston Pizza, East Side Mario's etc and that's not a bad thing."}
{"text":"The wife's fav. Nice, warm, great food with affordable wine list. Not as expensive as advertised. $15 entres average. Cheaper than big chains and a far better family experience."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the honeymoon spaghetti although it seems that there were less noodles than last time. They always provide crayons for the kids so we can draw on the paper tablecloths. Lasagna portion was huge. I love how the bathroom is always clean. We've been regulars for years."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, especially for lunch. Huge portions and the short lunch is probably more manageable unless you have a huge appetite. Salads are fresh and flavourful. The chicken pesto linguine is great and the small pizzettas are delicious. Friendly service and nice devour. Great for a business lunch too. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for years and the service and quality of the food have always been consistent. The servers are friendly and very knowledgeable about their menu. I also love their wine selection. They are reasonable priced , especially a few Californian wines they offer are all excellent and cheaper than other restaurants I've been to. If you are a red wine drinker try a glass of Jlohr and meatball pasta! Those two pairs really well..  I go in hungry and always come out full and happy! Hope they never change!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very nice but the food was disappointing.    Started with the mussels in white sauce. There were too many different flavours that ultimately clashed, making it an unpleasantly complicated dish.  I had no desire to mop up the sauce with the bread at the table, which is highly indicative of my disappointment, considering that I will usually take any opportunity to eat bread.    Next: the 'Villager's Vegetarian' pizza.  The crust was thick and spongy, reminiscent of stale focaccia.  While I usually LOVE my veggies, there were just too many on this pizza.  It felt more like a salad dumped on top of stale focaccia, scattered with dry feta cumbs and then broiled just long enough for the feta crumbs to almost burn.  When they first brought it out, it took me moment to figure out what the brown-black crumbs actually were.  Both dishes were edible and ok.  The portions were generous.  But I would take quality over quantity every time."}
{"text":"We've eaten here about three times over the last two years, hoping for better. Food is so so. Atmosphere is nice"}
{"text":"Last time I go there! Food is nothing special. But service was aweful. The staff offended my kids. Management made excuse after excuse when we voiced our concerns about it and it took forever to get anything because the server was always MIA. This is off our list of places to eat out. Prefer eating at Moxies where they value there customers returning back and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"All I have to say is WOW.. If you get the pleasure of having Mitch as your server then it's your lucky day... He is my food hero. He picked everything we ate and it was all amazing. We actually forgot our left overs and he came running out after us to bring the deliciousness to us... Great food , great service... This is my new go to restaurant.., loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic value and great food.  Go for the beef ribs melts in your mouth!!"}
{"text":"I am with the few people that seem to dislike the Olive Press, the food is at best mediocre and in general poor, to me the food is the level of Italian that you would get when dining at someone's house rather than authentic Italian.  The location is 2 mins from where I live and I waited eagerly for it open a few years ago after a year or so of watching the place be built and have tried the place 8 or 9 times since...and it is consistently poor in both food and service.  The staff are generally friendly but there seems to be no proper organisation or training and so the service is on the whole slow and frustrating, on most occasions that I have been people who came in after me were served before.  I sit in the bar as the restaurant is simply so full of children that it makes McDonalds seem like a pensioners paradise but I have felt more personal service at the Tim Hortons at the airport, the bar is simply a transit area to the restaurant with people standing around waiting.  We still go when we can't be bothered cooking and usually if it's weeknight but the food and service are always the same...busy or not so at least it's consistent but if you are expecting a good night out with home cooked Italian food you will be disappointed.  Unless you have a rabble of kids, like a mountain of stodgy food on your plate and don't want to talk to the people your dining with, due to the noise then this isn't the place for you but it is cheap...I am always pleasantly surprised at how low the bill is when it comes.  But at weekends it is consistently busy with the huge car park full and cars lined down the road so there are a lot of people out there who will obviously disagree with me and think the place is great so i don't complain when I go as I don't think they will change."}
{"text":"this place has nothing to do with Italy . I've been to Italy and I ate plenty of Italian food . This place could just be a fast food chain that serves a fusion non-identified cuisine using Italian names. Gravely disappointed . Will never repeat it."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously hard to find for people not in this area. The reason I'm mentioning this is that GPS won't take you to the correct location and the hostesses that answer the phone are clueless to where they are (psst - management get it together and tell your staff what you're east and west of, just saying). The doors are ridiculously hard to open and considering this is Oakville shouldn't this be easier for older people? Yes they have buttons but for everyone that doesn't expect to open the doors with that be prepared to nearly blow a gasket trying to open one.  We got takeout for the drive in, and the guy working the counter was courteous: giving us extra cutlery and a box. We waited only about 13 min for this amazing pizza - they got that part down... Now just work on the location and getting in and we're all set!"}
{"text":"Great alternative to eastside marios. Fair pricing for entrees and a nice casual atomisphere."}
{"text":"Food was below average. Our seafood pasta was watery. The mussels were tiny, scallops were not fresh, and the pappardelle pasta was overcooked and far from al dente. It was too soft making the pasta seem mushy. Sauce was not impressive-- no consistency, no flavor and watery. Dish was bland.  The chicken pizza was also nothing to rave about. The toppings were all dried out including the chicken. It's never fun eating dried out chicken. I could barely tell if there was a sauce base as it was all dried out.   Our server was MIA and we had to hail down another waiter to request for ours. By that point, we were ready to order our entire meal without someone starting us off with water, drinks and bread.  Overall, not too impressed and probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great place for a family meal.  The service is good.  I had the Veal Parm which was a generous portion and not overly salty.  The dining room can get loud though. The previous time I was here, I had the Stromboli which was very good too."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!! The staff is always friendly and the food is fantastic. The quantity of the food never leaves you hungry, my family and I are regulars here :)   Get the honeymoon pasta, best seafood pasta you will ever have. I scoop the sauce up with a spoon every time. If I could lick the plate I probably would."}
{"text":"Good portion, large selection, nicely decorated but all of this were overshadowed by bland, mediocre tasting food. Pass."}
{"text":"I really like the food here. It's fresh and tasty and they have a lot of options.  Wish they had a few more fish options, but I can deal with the seafood pasta.  I have been a few times and the service is always really great, attentive and quick. It's a bussling place, and that never has seemed to get in the way of getting the food to the table.    The warm olives, calamari and bruscetta are all really yummy. I've tried a number of the pastas, and they're all very good. I will be back when another birthday comes up in the area. It's the resto of choice for us for good priced Italian food!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with friends. Great choice of food and it's really filling. Enough for you to take away as well. Good spot for a larger group or party."}
{"text":"Ratings: Food: 9/10 Drink: 10/10 Service: 10/10 Value: 9/10 Hygiene: 10/10 Aesthetics: 9/10  This restaurant is in a little bit of a random location. The first few times I passed by, I thought it was a plaza or a store. This place is definitely one of the less expensive places to get quality Italian food in Oakville.  This place does a fantastic job with their drinks and food. The cocktails are always good and the quality of the food is always good.  The cost of a typical entrée is around $15-20. The quality and portions are great. My favourite thing here though has to be the sticky toffee pudding with a scoop of ice cream (this is a must). It's a decent sized portion, so I usually share one after the entrée. The only thing I wish they had here would be fresh pasta, rather than the imported stuff.   It has a very rustic feel, similar to a marche for decor. I like the open kitchen, it adds a little bit of liveliness to the restaurant. It has a lot of seats from booths to tables, so they are able to cater to larger groups as well as small groups.  The service here is very friendly and they were attentive and prompt. They do pay attention to quality, and will try to make sure you're satisfied with your meal.  A great place to go if you don't want to head downtown Oakville for Italian food, and they do a fantastic job. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place was a find.  I have driven by The Olive Press many times, but finally decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. The atmosphere is casual, warm and welcoming and the wait staff is as well. I ordered the Tuscan lamb chops because I wanted something different than my normal steak. The lamb chops have a nice dry rub and it grilled to perfection. The sides were potatoes and vegetables, which add a nice touch. I paired my meal with a nice glass of Montepulciano d' Abruzzo. Delicious! I left more than satisfied."}
{"text":"CARB HEAVEN!!!! My favourite Italian restaurant! It's not busy at all for lunch, so don't bother making a reservation. But, make a reservation for dinner for sure!   Family friendly and GREAT service! The portion sizes of each dish is incredibly humongous!   APPETIZERS: For the love of God...try their Nachos! Im not a nacho fan but these nachos are the best I have ever had! The nachos are crispy pasta dough that look a like a light fried wonton, empty cheese, sausage, tomatoes, alfredo sauce, peppers, olives, onions & mozzarella. Served w/ marinara sauce & sour cream.   You also can't go wrong with their crispy calamari!   ENTREE: You have to try Pappardelle Carbonara...best ever with Smoked ham, pancetta bacon, mushrooms, red onions, creamy alfredo sauce, green onions garnish.  Second must try: Honeymoon Spaghetti Inspired by a romantic trip to the Amalfi coast. Mussels, shrimp & scallops in creamy tomato wine sauce w/ lobster stock, chilies, herbs, green onion garnish.  Try their lobster ravioli as well! Simple tasty and creamy!   DESSERT: The sticky toffee pudding and Tiramisu  This place has a special place in my heart... for CHEAT DAYS!"}
{"text":"I've had the Pesto Chicken from there twice, it's absolutely incredible if you're thinking of going there this is a must have dish!"}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy Yummy...  The food is fenominal! A nice variey of Italian food; freshly made and full of flavour.  An absolute MUST is the Pasta Fritti appatizer. It is the Italian version of Nachos. I really do not think I can describe the awesomness that my tastebuds felt with words; a visual would help, but trying it is really the only way you will understand. An abundance of veggies, Italian sausage (if you wish), delicious marinara sauce, alfredo sauce, and mozzarella. I recommend you share with this with at least one other person, otherwise you will not be able to try anything else and, trust me, you want to try other things."}
{"text":"So my previous review indicated poor service. June 7th my boyfriend and I went back for dinner around 5:30pm. Everyone was friendly and Mitch was an awesome waiter. He was funny and had such a positive attitude. The food again was delicious...the flavours hit the mark.  I honestly believe, looking back at my first experience, that maybe our previous waitress was having a bad day..who knows..because it seems..after observing the staff from the hostess to the bartender to the other servers, that they are taught the importance of customer service for this restaurant. I can appreciate management taking all concerns seriously and going to various lengths to maintain a content, loyal customer base. This is why I have increased my rating to 4 from the previous rating of 2. Thank you for inviting me again Olive Press, I will definitely be returning. :)"}
{"text":"Incredibly good atmosphere. The restaurant is really clean and the staff are very friendly. They really make an effort to accommodate you. I had the rustic lasagna and is one of the best I have had. My daughter had the carbonara and they are not shy with the toppings! Lost and easy parking !   Excellent service and food!!"}
{"text":"Nice decor felt very comfortable, service was fine and prices reasonable.  I wish the food was more delicious."}
{"text":"5 of us had dinner here on a Saturday. We really had no idea what to expect and when I checked their website I was just expecting \"ok\" food.  Apps .... ceasar salad OK, red pepper soup very good, mozza sticks and fried calamari excellent.  4 cheese baked penne very good, short ribs and lobster ravioli excellent.  Good selection of wines at reasonable price points.  Service was very good. There's lots of upsells happening which I don't often see at an Italian restaurant. It's a large menu so there's something for everyone.  It's quite a large restaurant, they don't take reservations unless you're a large group."}
{"text":"The service is fantastic, very friendly wait staff. The prices are reasonable.  The atmosphere is elegant and casual, and very modern looking.  You can't go wrong with this place.  Overall experience 8/10.  I've been here a few times with family.  I would highly recommend this place for couples, family get togethers, or a group of friends.    Derek"}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. Always busy but great service. The chicken parm. Is one of my favourites."}
{"text":"I went to the Olive Press for the first time last night. The decor is elegant but practical. The hostess seated me immediately, although I switched seats at the table because I found the glare of the afternoon sun through the large window at the front of the restaurant a bit much. My server came to my table promptly and answered my questions about the menu. I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs. They gave me an adequate serving of pasta and three large meatballs. Next time, if I order the same thing I might ask for two meatballs instead. I thought the quality of the entree and the price were excellent. I had no complaints about either. The service was good too. I also found the washroom to be clean but I had trouble finding it. That is minor. I would have given this place 5 stars, but I didn't like the complimentary bread and there didn't seem to be a choice. It might have been the type of bread, but I thought it was stale.  A good old fashioned Italian dinner can be hard to find these days for under $20. I will gladly recommend this place to any of my friends."}
{"text":"Prices are very reasonable, food is fresh and flavourful.. Portions are large.. I enjoyed the lasagna very much and my boyfriend loved the spicy sausage penne... Pizza was also delicious.. Tiramasu was just ok but I'm not a fan in general.."}
{"text":"Horrible Italian food. Way over hyped and over priced. Many other better Italian food restaurants in the Oakville area. Do not waste hunger or money here."}
