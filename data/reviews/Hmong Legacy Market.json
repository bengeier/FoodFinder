{"text":"The Papaya Salad here is the cheapest around town and they give the most generous portion I've seen.   I was in a mood for papaya salad and remembered reading about the hidden snack corner in this store. I went on a Friday afternoon and there was only one other patron in the snack area. I ordered the papaya salad ($5) and the man behind the counter asked \"how many peppers?\" then began to make the salad from scratch using a mortar and pestle.   FYI if you want it spicy, tell them '4' peppers. I love and tolerate spicy food well, but this had my mouth sweating.  The end product was a crisp, hearty sized to-go container of salty sweet goodness. The young green papayas were finely shredded and well balanced throughout. Also sprinkled atop were generous helpings of roasted peanuts.   If you like your papaya salad a little saltier and fishier, ask for it in Laos Style. Thai style is what they serve at other Thai restaurants around town, which is more sweet and sour.  Super friendly folks, mom-and-pop run business that I'll definitely support and recommend all my yelpers to try out!  They also serve other favorites such as Larb, Pho, and fried fish!   They have rearranged the store a bit and are now offering a nice area for a sit-down meal by the order counter."}
{"text":"Decent Hmong market located right of the West Beltline. Located in a small plaza along with a laundromat. Very friendly staff.   Small selection of Asian items. You will find a good amount of rice, spices, sauces, drinks, noodles, and fresh produce. Small selection of kitchen items: pans, Tiger rice cookers, motor and pestles. There is a front display with Hmong traditional wear for sale too.  There is a deli in the back of the market that serves egg rolls, sticky rice, chicken, Hmong sausages. They also have Thai iced tea, Thai coffee, bubble tea, but no tapioca pearls. Portions are great! Freshness of the food depends on the time of day you go in. I had soggy egg rolls around 6pm on a Friday. Other times I've gone to eat lunch - the food was excellent.   Accepts cash and card. Definitely needs an interior update. Would love to see more fresh meat in the aisles. Prices for the grocery items are great compared to other Asian markets I've been to."}
{"text":"This store have some good things to offer. The fresh food isn't so bad BUT the lady who works at the back is weird. She gives off a weird vibe. Last time I went there, it was around 5pm. I went to the back and she was eating at the table looking at me. They ran out of food, but she just sat there eating and didn't even say anything. And also, some things ARE pretty pricy."}
{"text":"This review is mainly for the papaya. After yelping several places, I found this spot and have been coming here for my papaya fix. I especially love Nina's papaya! But the downside is sometimes later in the day, she's not there. I would recommend Nina's or the lady with the glasses. I've tried the other older lady and the guy's papaya but Nina's is hands down, the best one! The workers are super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Ia and family run a small neighborhood grocery store and eatery with strong Hmong roots. It changed hands and was formerly named, Madison Oriental Market, and now offer a bit more variety. They offer tasty pho, papaya and cucumber salads, pork belly, stuffed chicken wings, purple sticky rice, egg rolls, and a few other specials. The family has a huge few acre garden and they sell their Thai chiles, garlic, onion, melon, greens, and root vegetables. They also sell there own homemade noodle, tofu, pickled greens, chile oil, and a fiery fish sauce spike hot sauce. Cans of curries, chile paste, teas, hosin sauce, and dried noodle are the cheapest around. Stop by and stock up on the Asian goods you need to make some masterpieces at home, grab a snack, and maybe meet, Tom, one of the owners and cutest old guys ever!"}
{"text":"My sister and I came for pho and we were not disappointed. The pho was delicious and it was pretty cheap for good pho around Madison. We also ordered bubble tea which was disappointing. The tapioca balls' texture seemed like it was old as it was soft and flaky, not firm and chewy. Also disappointed about their service, when we went to order, not even a smile or a hi from the deli woman. Just some advice: it doesn't hurt to greet your customers."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch, I read the reviews for Papaya salad, so I picked that. While I reviewed the menu another customer said they had ordered the Papaya salad. I'm not a huge fan of spicy and I picked 2 peppers. It was delicious, but way too spicy for me. I could taste how amazing it was, but I'll give it to the hubs. Next time, and yes there is a next time, I will order it without the peppers. The customer said to order sticky rice and roll it in a ball and dip it in the juices from the salad. The service was very nice, the deli counter attendant was helpful to make choices and very friendly. The store was so clean and organized. I also noticed that I will be buying all my ramen noodle packages there, since there are 30 to choose."}
{"text":"Located near the Belt line in the Fitchburg area, this little Hmong Legacy Market shop has a good selection of traditional food mixed with decent selection of variety of other Asian snacks.   Additionally, there's a tiny window for a deli in the back that have some traditional Hmong food ready in minutes. You can dine in or choose to take it to go at your own convenience.   Since I got pho, we decided to dine in and the servers nicely bought out our food. (Only problem was I didn't want any cilantro or green onions and took a good amount of time just picking these out.)  My boyfriend got some pork belly and it was chewy and delicious.   Plus there's a single stall bathroom in the middle of  store for you to use at your convenience.   Overall, we had a pleasant time at this local family owned shop for a delicious home-cooked style meal. There were little children running around the store but that just adds to the family-oriented experience.   Check it out when you get a chance, the only thing I wished would be gone is the annoying bells ringing throughout the store but I imagine they use that to track people coming into the store. Otherwise, food was great, and we're likely to go back in the future to pick up snacks and eat some more Hmong food."}
