{"text":"The service was good. Mike makes you feel at home. Grab a pop and take a seat. Food was tasty and quick. Had the special and the girls had a pizza. I liked it cause it was well done."}
{"text":"Best Chicago style deep dish in the city hands down.  Mike is legit from Chicago and all of the food is great with even better prices.  Check it out."}
{"text":"This place is terrible and they rip people off! And when you call to explain that you are over charged, they tell you that you received items that you did not receive. Very rude on the phone as well!! Save your money and choose somewhere else to eat!!"}
{"text":"The pan pizza is absolutely incredible. Takes 40 min once ordered and well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Awsm  food  great  deals need to  come  see  us great  service  fun people  good atmusfear"}
{"text":"Love this place the delevery guy is now fast clean cut and hospitable the food is the best in town the owner Mike is a pleasure to talk to"}
{"text":"Best pie I've had in Vegas! Only place I'll be going for my deep dish from now on.  Got the pleasure of meeting pizza Mike. He assured me I would be back. I can see why he's so confident."}
{"text":"First time/Last time customers  The food looks more appealing than it tastes.  We ordered a Chicago Styled and a regular pizza and both pizzas were extremely bland. The Chicago: had WAY TOO much cheese (so much so that you get tired of eating it because ALL you taste is cheese), the sauce is bland, the sausage tasted really good but there was very little of it, and the crust was definately not flakey or buttery it tasted frozen and, by my guess, frozen a bit too long. The regular pizza: had a nice sauce to cheese ratio but the sauce and, frozen, crust were exteremely bland.   We had our pizzas delivered which was nice. The ladies that we dealt with were very pleasant. Our order was correct and arrived before the delivery time. Our food was warmish when it arrived. Sadly, our $39 (including tip) would have been better spent at any of the well known pizza delivery chains."}
{"text":"The food service & quality are awful. The manager is racist & said he doesn't serve my kind! The kitchen staff said he doesn't serve my kind & told me I ordered something different from what I ordered. I've been there twice & he completely messed up an Italian beef sandwich & the worst thin crust pizza I ever had. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Windy City beefs & pizza or Brandos are real Chicago bars with good Chicago pizza! He called me a liar about a wet Italian beef sandwich & then served me a dry beef with cheese! He said I ordered it that way & then came back to apologize he was wrong. As for the thin crust I ordered I never got thin crust pizza and that's what I ordered & he argued & called me names even in front of the bartender & customers. He called me a liar & told me to never come back. Health inspectors were also there! AWFUL FOOD & AWFUL SERVICE!!!!"}
{"text":"I had never been inside the Inn Zone, but stopped in for a late breakfast.  I was totally surprised to find the Italian Restaurant.  They had a sign for stuffed shells, so I switched from breakfast to shells immediately.  They tasted great, and the sauce tasted great.  I just was surprised that there were only three shells.  I expected more.  I will be back."}
{"text":"My order was for delivery. I am not expecting a fresh burger and fries when you order for delivery, but I still expect the taste to be great. I ordered the Bull's burger with a side of Garlic Bites with pizza sauce.  We just moved in to town and don't have a key code for the gate since we didn't have a local number, I told the guy on the phone I would meet the driver at the gate/club house. I wait out there for over a half an hour, (they just said they would be there within the hour) in the cold, only for my husband, with the flu to call and say they got in and the food was at our place. First strike. I understand people can get in through the gate, but if I tell you I will meet you at the club house, then don't drive to our apartment.  The barbecue sauce on the burger was so gross. It was covered in nacho cheese sauce, not cheddar cheese, thus making the burger really soggy. The garlic bites are really nothing special, just gross breading with a teeny bit of cheese sprinkled on them. I am just not impressed, but like I said earlier, since it was a burger getting delivered, I will give them at least two stars. I am still super hungry."}
{"text":"Once you get past the dego Mike , try a real Chgo beef or thin crust pizza. The food was just perfect ."}
{"text":"A Slice of Chicago is now located inside Cactus Jack's. The pizza is good and the Italian beef is very lean and tasty. We had 'steak cut' onion rings and my dad said they were the best onion rings he ever tasted. Pizza Mike is very friendly and loves to talk about Chicago. Highly recommend this place for anyone that is  missing authentic Chicago food."}
{"text":"I just had their fettuccine Alfredo pasta with shrimp and mushrooms! It was mouth watering. I usually get their delicious cheese pizza but decided to try this today! But their address is wrong now! They are actually on Maryland and St Rose!!! Still a hit spot."}
{"text":"Sooo  I have had food here several times. this place usually has pretty good  authentic-ish cheesy chicago-ish food. The problem that I usually run into is that they either dont have the right ingredients for whatever I want, or they are closing early, so they simply wont make me food(just close shop, it was 10:00 and you didnt close til 11:00 but for some reason you couldnt make anything)....anyways its kinda good, but only if you can get in here one of the times that the proprietor is here, otherwise avoid this place."}
{"text":"So, I have had times here where the service was bad because the cook had a bad attitude. But the food is so good that I hade to come back. My favorite item on the menu is the Italian beef sandwich. The specialty fries are also delicious. Tonight I also tried the pizza bread which was pretty good and very inexpensive."}
{"text":"The wings & fries were good. I got mild wings they did not taste hot. What they tasted like a slight bbq & pepper. I can assume it's a house dressing. The pizza was a bit over oily. The sauce was to sweet for my taste. The crust was thick on the back but the bottom of the crust was extra thin. They over load your pizza with cheese. So I'm in heaven.   What I ordered was pepperoni but I could taste other meats such as salami. You have to first find a seat. Remember your table number then place your order. Pay once the food arrives at the table. Big TVs are all around the game is on. I love it here."}
{"text":"I had the most fabulous dinner ever at the End Zone on Rainbow and Westcliff most amazing server Pizza Mike very nice man funny and people Oregon it he came out to check on us see if we needed any more napkins or plates or silverware service was at 10 the food was a 10 and also you can watch football soccer basketball baseball hockey you can play Pinball there's two pool tables and there's two other video game arcade games so let her out to you at the end zone Pizza Mike and  slice of Chicago fabulous time thank you for your great food and fun atmosphere will definitely take my friends and go again for dinner and eat a slice of Chicago my new favorite place to eat yay I hope you guys go out to the end zone and have a party Moretz football you order if you don't you're missing out taste just like Chicago is here in Las Vegas thanks again Pizza Mike for bringing us a little slice of Chicago Jodi l"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would... The delivery lady left the pizza on my porch because the manager told her to. He refused to refund us the money because according to him it was the right order... Even the ticket had the right order but the pizza was incorrect. Then he threatened to call the cops because when I called back for a refunded he said I was harassing him... Worst customer service I have ever experienced. Id love to hear that 911 call..... Jerk."}
{"text":"I live close to here and frequent the Inn Zone, so this review comes from someone who has had several experiences at A Slice of Chicago.  First off, the food is damn good. Delicious and lots of good variety. I love the pizza, the skyscraper fries, the hot dogs, the burgers, the pasta....all good.  The service, however? Terrible. Tonight I had an item missing from my order for delivery. Last time I ordered delivery they didn't have change for $40 so I just....didn't get all my change back. No \"we'll get you next time\" or \"have some fries on us\", just \"sorry we don't have change.\"  The other downside is their prices aren't consistent. I constantly find myself being mischarged or charged different from time to time on items.  My recommendation is to never order delivery, only dine-in, so that way you can address any fuck-ups they do on the spot. The food is delicious, but never order delivery because you'll always, somehow, end up getting ripped off."}
{"text":"The quality of Pizza Mike's italian beef is insanely good... no his french dip isn't a philly cheesesteak, but it never claims to be!! Mike made me a carb free cheesesteak over lettuce ... soooo good... OMG! Wish it was in EAST Henderson :("}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza cut in squares Chicago style extra crispy.  Worth the drive from Orange county.  We are from Chicago so we  also tried the hot dog and awesome italian beef all imported fro Chicago.  The location is a little out of the way, don't let that sway you.  Leslie was our friendly and informative server.  All this place needs is more  customers."}
{"text":"This was our first time there, just happened to drive by and saw it and me being from Chicago we had to try it! We met the owner Mike who was very nice and gave us his background from Chicago he used to own 2 pizza places in Des Plaines.  He makes his own Giardiniera and Italian beef.  We had the Chicago fries which had Itallian beef and hot peppers with lots of cheese on top of fresh cut fries.  The fries were good came out hot the beef and cheese were awesome however, I thought the peppers could've been a little spicier!  We also ordered a small double dough pizza with sauIsage, pepperoni, and bacon.  It came out piping hot had tons of melty cheese and a lot of toppings.  The pizza was good our only thought is the sauce could have a little more seasoning to it but overall we thoroughly enjoyed it.  For a small pizza I thought it was good size as we brought some home!  They have only been open for 7 weeks and are still adding to the menu they will be adding Chicago hot dogs soon!  I would definitely go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place. From the moment we sat down it was bad. We ordered two pizzas and some appetizers.  Waitress said it takes about 40 mins for pizza to be ready. We ended up waiting  an hour and twenty minutes. We were the only customers in place. I have never heard of a pizza taking that long. Cold maraina sauce was thrown on top of pizza which cooled off the pizza. There were two kids running in and out of the place. I can say we definitely will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Awful food.  They do not delivery so we called in to try their signature Chicago-style deep dish pizza and chicken tenders.  Meh.  Pizza had too much cheese and the sauce was On the bottom. Real Chicago deep dish pizza is sauce on top. Very unremarkable.  Pretty sure the chicken tenders came out of the frozen section at the grocery store.  The Pizza was maybe worst dish on the table; it was unsatisfactory. Our meal was $52 after tax and tip. Wasn't worth it.    I'm surprised they are still in business, especially with so many other great options .  Maybe the Chicago-style pizza is worth it if you have the time."}
{"text":"The absolute worst customer service from The manager. He was beyond rude. The pizza was wrong and missing things and he refused to correct it or take it back. I don't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"OMG! Pizza Mike brought Chicago Pizza deep dish to Las Vegas! Mike used to own Carmen's Pizza and Pasta House on Golf Road in Schaumburg. His pizza Is amazing. We got a pepperoni, onion, Italian sausage and mushroom. We had to wait a little while, but we didn't mind because it was perfection. We will definitely be back! The ingredients are fresh and the crust and sauce are amazing. And just so you know there is no sauce on the bottom like someone else complained about! Perfect just like in Chicago."}
{"text":"This business is no longer open at this location. They have moved else where and you may visit his website at asliceofchicagolv.com"}
{"text":"Always amazing !! I am a repeat customer . The things I like best are the Italian beef, big beef combo, Philly cheese steak, and pizza. Mike is always a great host. Stop in and check it out."}
{"text":"Real Chicago pizza!!!!!!  Haven't had a bad one yet.  Highly recommended.   Better prices than the competition too."}
{"text":"The service SUCKs and they don't accept American Express. Never had so much attitude before. Go back to Chicago and get yourself up to speed. We are in the 21st century."}
{"text":"First time here. Went with wife and kids. Ordered chicago fries, onion rings, western pizza and taco pizza. Got 7 onion rings, dry micowaved fries and waited 1 hour and 20 minutes for pizza. The western did not have any beef or bacon and very little onion and peppers. The taco pizza had cold sause on the top. I would not go back or refer this place to anyone unless you want expensive cheese pizzas."}
{"text":"Don't call a French dip a Philly Cheese sammich... I don't find the staff's characters charming.  The place was clean, beer was cold (when the car wench wasn't busy texting), food was hot and good... But I woke up puking in the night... I'm not sure if that was the food here's fault, but I ain't sure that it isn't either."}
{"text":"I can actually say I love their thin crust pizza. I do lunch at least 3 times a month there. I enjoy their BLT, but Bulls burger is my boys favorite. It is inside a bar, so alcohol is readily available. Friendly and fast service, even during rush hour.  When I do get busy, I love that they deliver, even though it's walking distance from My job."}
{"text":"Hard to find the place because it is inside of another place. You then order through a small rectangular hole in the wall. I got the Italian Beef, it was okay, owner claims the beef is imported, he should have imported the rolls and broth as well. The roll was toasted and the you are given a bowl of beef broth to dip you sandwich in.  Water is free and self service. The place has a bad smoke smell do to the bar (remember a place inside another place)."}
{"text":"I will NEVER eat here again. I work across the street at the hospital. Ordered a calzone. Tipped the delivery guy. Took about 2 bites of the calzone before I found what could only be either PUBIC or ARMPIT hair. I called to explain this and was called FUCKING ridiculous and was told I could not speak with the manager. He also said mozzarella cheese looks alot like pubic hair...ummm, what?!! What a piece of shit that guy was. Gross..."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and absolutely love the food. The meat is trucked in once a month from chicago, the burgers are made fresh out of the ground beef when you order it, the Philly is outstanding and the pizza is amazing!!!! I recommend giving this place a try and I don't think you will be dissapointed.  If you try it and you don't like it then one meal for the day sucked but...... if you like it then you will have a new place to eat at all the time!!!!"}
{"text":"We always have a good time visiting the Innzone. The food here is not to bad, we really enjoy the garlic cheese bread it is great, may even go as far as to say it's the best on the menue. However the pizzas are easily 2nd best have not been disappointed with the pies. We have tried some other things on the menue, not really the greatest but ok.. Cool little restaurant pool table avalable. It is a bit smoky in here but hey its linked to a bar. As far as the Innzone goes Steve is the best!!! Always friendly and a great person to bs with!!"}
{"text":"They are now located inside cactus jacks saloon.  Located on Maryland Pkwy just north of St. Rose.  Ate there yesterday.  Same menu, but a much better bar than the Inn Zone."}
{"text":"My beau and I have been looking for authentic Chicago deep dish pizza in the Valley for awhile. It's here folks!!!! Great feel-at-home service and awesome food that's reasonable priced!!!! Nice sports bar environment!!!"}
