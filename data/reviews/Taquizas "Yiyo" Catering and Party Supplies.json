{"text":"Overall - Tacos Yiyo MADE our daughters quinceañera (15th birthday) Party! Thank you!  We WILL DEFINITELY have them cover our next party! We are just looking for an excuse to throw a party to have these guys over again!  La comida - riquísima! Starting with the cebolla on the comal, the smell instantly caught my nose! Tacos, 4 different meats, ALL Tasty!, with the most delicious vegetarian options (quesadillas), and even vegan (nopalitos anyone?!)..  the vegetarians were all blown away, even the meat eaters enjoyed it! Las salsas, verdura, toppings, all fresh and beautifully laid out in Mexican clay bowls- perfectly complemented the tacos y quesadillas, rice and beans.  Las Aguas frescas - buenísimas!.. our guests loved the spread: piña, tamarindo, horchata, limonada (adults got to spike it with their choice of spirit, and these aguas make excellent cocktails!!  El servicio- on point! Sergio was very easy to schedule, plan, and work with.  He saved the date until we made the deposit, he was here on time, the whole crew was very courteous, well prepared with:  tables,  chairs,  manteles (tablecloths) of our chosen color! All plates, utensils, cups, napkins.. everything well stocked. and - even a brinca brinca (bouncy house)!  We almost got the mechanical bull and rockola - but saved it for next time.  Gracias Taquizas Yiyo!!!  Do yourself a favor and let these guys do all the work, while you enjoy all the compliments from your week fed happy guests."}

{"text":"I'm glad I looked on Yelp for a Taquiza. Yiyos by far the best from first call for questions to the end of the party. It's a great couple that both offer really good customer service. The food set up was really nice and presentable every one at dinner loved it. The meat well cooked with flavor to it all the condiment had good taste salsas, guacamole ect. The horchata waters was also very tasty I definitely recommend."}

{"text":"I was very excited about doing business with this taquiza. Unfortunately, I won't be doing business with them because the guy cancelled on me on the day I was going to give him the deposit to reserve the date for the party. I had been talking to Sergio for the past two weeks about the event and it all sounded we were both on the same page. I confirmed with him 3 days ago that I was going to meet him today to give him the deposit. As I called him today to go drop off the deposit, he started questioning me again about the party details when we had already discussed all of that in our previous conversations and texts.  He just straight  out told me he wasn't going to be available that date and therefore could not do the taquiza. Unbelievable!!!! What kind of customer service is this??? No integrity???I almost feel he got upset that I chose  the smaller package for 50 people and not a bigger one.Im not inviting the whole world to the party, therefore I don't need to get a bigger package. In our previous conversations he kept insisting that  I should get the package for 100 people instead.... I was really looking forward to doing business with him because of his good reviews on Facebook, but unfortunately he didn't want to do business with me and cancelled my reservation when we both had agreed to it. It really sucks!!!!"}
