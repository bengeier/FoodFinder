{"text":"It's what a good gyros should taste like - simple and fresh. Their pork sticks are also very good, however, depending on who's working they won't always make them (from my experience). What I come here for is the kontosouvli (kebab on the rotisserie). It's fairly priced and always on point. In short, it looks like a whole in the wall but it blows Messinis, Tzatziki, Alexandro's and whatever other gyros joints in and around the danforth out of the water!"}
{"text":"On a hungry weekend, the recommendations of fellow yelpers lead me to the discovery of this hidden gem.  

The place is literally a hole in the wall.   If I was not looking for this place, I would have walked past it without noticing it.  The small restaurants is family owned and unpretentious.  Most of the business is take out, but there are a few tables in the front and outside.  

You cant go wrong with their pork or chicken gyro - with all the fixing, including fries, is only $8.  We tried them both and enjoyed every last bite. 

The owner wrapped it up like a cone to make it a tasty and efficient street food."}
{"text":"A hole-in-the-wall place with simple, terrific food, and really excellent (cheap) prices. There's almost not seating, so takeout is a better bet.

We ordered a pork gyro and a chicken kontosouvli (think gyro wrap, but with pieces of rotisserie pork or chicken). They were fresh and delicious, if a bit on the salty side - but I eat more bland at home. 

The servings were super generous. While watching the staff make it, I honestly thought the meat he took was to make two portions... but no, the entire thing was for our order (it looked like at least a quarter chicken and a large, heaping handful of pork). 

A definite must-go if you're in the area and want some quick and cheap but tasty Greek food."}
{"text":"Comida boa, preço justo.
Atendimento corrido então é bom já se decidir antes de chegar no balcão."}
{"text":"I'm glad I saw this place before going to Square Boy for my usual chicken souvlaki. It's just across from Pape station. There wasn't a line up so I was a little apprehensive but I would probably be waiting at Square Boy. I walked in and was greeted by the lady owner. They have souvlaki and gyros but I've never had a Kontosouvli ($8).  It's very similar to the gyro except the meat (pork) she was cutting was on a horizontal rotisserie. I asked for everything on it plus feta for $1 extra. The pork meat was tasty & succulent and not dry at all. With the feta it just made this even more delicious. So glad I found this place and it's an excellent alternative to Square Boy or Messini."}
{"text":"Conveniently located across from the Pape TTC station. 
Gyro is very tasty. Sadly my gyro had \"old\" soggy fries while my SO's fries were fried fresh. Lots of meat, tasty and beautifully toasted. Very filling meal. 

Guy who took our order was quite friendly."}
{"text":"I think it must be a great deal for meat eaters, not so much for vegetarians. The fries look real, not out of a bag, the pitas were thick and fresh, after eating my veg wrap, my mouth tasted super duper garlicy. And there was a lot of fresh onion on them too, just FYI. Nice family atmosphere, virtually no seating."}
{"text":"The Gyros we ate with my gf was simply lovely! And unlike other kebab-like places the meat quality was decent. Would recommend to everybody!"}
{"text":"My go to for this place is the Kontosouvli wrap, which is around $9 I believe.

It is a little salt forward so make sure you go easy on the salty feta. 

I love how they put fries into the pita; it's just so authentic. I hate a dry pita so I always ask for extra tzatziki. 

It is so big, I can split it in half (this can get messy) and save it for another meal. Don't forget to ask for extra napkins :)"}
{"text":"Quintessential Greek street food experience! Rotisserie chicken and pork, with simple, fresh ingredients at an affordable price. You can't do wrong here!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and open late!!  Love this place!!  U need to try it!  I'm adding more text to fill the review not sure what else I can say about it!"}
{"text":"Great simple place .. The pork souvlaki is one of the best I tried after Astoria NYC .
Had to wait 15 minutes since they made it fresh but well worth the wait .
The staff are good folks too . It's fast food but it's better then most restaurants in Greek town .

I give it five star for pork souvlaki and customer service"}
{"text":"Directly across the street from Pape station is a small place in plain sight called Souv Like.  In the heart of Greektown lies this tiny Greek place with a menu so simple it's really only 6 things some of which repeat because they are the same thing except with different meat (chicken or pork) where as either lamb or beef was an option it was scratched out.  

This is one of the reasons I love Yelp.  I normally don't spend much time on the east side but when I do I seem to make the most of it.  Places like this place just reaffirm that Yelp works and the public's opinions mean something and if you take all the aggregate opinions and roll them into a ball and serve it up like a belt high fastball, you too can hit it out of the park.

At first glance the place seems as small at it appears.  There are perhaps 3 tables of 2 inside and a couple outside.  While waiting in line it seemed most people were taking their orders to go.  The menu is on the chalk board not even at eye level to the left on the wall opposite the cash counter.  Gyro wraps, Kontosouvli wraps, Souvlaki  wraps (chicken or pork for each), yes that's it and nothing is more than 7 dollars.  Simple?  Perhaps a better terminology is efficient.  Immediately I was awestruck at the sheer size of those spinning cones of meat.  

You know when you go to a place and if you're a meat lover like me you can admire the spinning meat on those vertical spits cooking the meat evening and crisping the outer parts in a perpetual skilled cycle that just turns and turns and gets shaved and then just keeps turning?  Well these meat displays were huge.  I mean wide, girth, arms around it kind of wow.  I can't say how heavy one of those things were because to call them cones would be inaccurate.  They weren't narrower at any point rather just a really healthy looking impressive mass of spinning and cooking loveliness.  I heart that display...  I swear they had to be over 18 inches in diameter if not closer to 2 feet from afar.  It was just amazing to look at.

OK enough of the gawking at the pair of spinning meat twins and back to business.  The food... I had looked online before coming here and noticed there were dinner versions not mentioned on the menu which only had the wraps mentioned.  I had to ask the gentleman about that and he said, \"yes, there is a dinner plate that comes with fries, salad, pita and the meat of your choice\".  I was like like hell ya hook me up.  OK I didn't actually say it like that but yes I was going to get that, chicken version.

So while waiting in line I was able to see the fine gentleman making wraps for others so I had an idea of what it was about.  My wife wanted a chicken wrap so she had asked for that but without the fries inside.  Fries inside?  Kind of sounds like a Pittsburgh thing.  I would have went for that if I was getting that because it looked good.  The customers behind us were saying she was missing the best part and told her to ask for the secret sauce.  They were Greek saying the Greeks know what it is and how it's a must have on the wrap.  

I was waiting for my order and noticed that the gentleman serving us wasn't' getting a plate together.  He was actually getting a TRAY, covering it with paper and then placing what would become my lunch on what seemed to be at least 14 by 14 inch tray.  I'm like ok, this is more than a square foot of food and wow was it ever generous.  Fries, salad, grilled pita and what seemed to be greater than a pound if not more (I estimated at least 20 ounces) of meat.  I was blown away.  This was an entire tray of food, easily enough for the both of us but instead all mine.  It was what...15 bucks?  I couldn't believe how much food this was as it was truly a feast.  The best baseline to explain how much food this was is whether I (who can eat more than an average person I'd say) can finish this meal in one sitting or not.  The answer was a resounding \"NO\".  This was a LOT of food and while I'm greedy and can eat a decent amount on any given day this serving just won if it were a contest.  It was no contest really as it was over before it even began.  

Now regardless of the serving size of this meal if also was in fact very good.  The chicken although carved from the outside (which is what you want) was still very succulent and not just dried up tough pieces but very much the contrary.  The meat was so good, tasty and seasoned.  My wife liked hers too, a bit salty for her she said but for me it was right up my alley.  The salad was crispy and cold and the fries were fresh and piping hot while the pita just balanced out the entire meal.  What a meal!  I couldn't finish it as I mentioned so my wife asked for a take out container.

Souv Like - a tiny place across a subway station in Greektown.  I found it through Yelp and this is why Yelp works for me, time and time again.  This is why I Yelp."}
{"text":"Best gyro in town! Nothing like it on the danforth. There's always a place to go for a gyro in Greek town but finally this is the place to go over and over again! The service is good and you are in and out in no time! The food is amazing. Both the chicken and the pork gyros are so good and well worth it and the price is amazing. 
I've gone on several occasions such as lunch with coworkers or a late night eat. And this place does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Beautiful little hole-in-the-wall. Will be back..."}
{"text":"Best gyro in Toronto. I would recommend take-out as its not the nicest dine in atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have no words to describe the heavenly rotisserie pork here. Come here soon! Home made everything ."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best gyros on the Danforth (and I've tried a number of establishments on the Danforth)! Gyros ($6.19) are beautifully seasoned and the fries are crispy. I'm gonna have to stop trying other places and make this my go-to spot!"}
{"text":"BEST Gyro in Toronto...if you haven't been, you must go!!! Small place...Good fresh food, fast service and amazing  prices...big portions too cause greeks like to eat!! I love this place cause it reminds me of the the authentic gyro they have in Greece! Delicious."}
{"text":"I've only ever had their chicken or pork gyros and they are so good! they stuff the wrap with fries too, it's a good thing I don't live right by there or I'd be eating here way too much. They also do greek fries if you ask"}
{"text":"There's no better feasting then the kind you do after a long night at the club, and one of the prime foods to get after a late night out is souvlaki. Souv Like has such super moist, melty pork gyro the perfect savory post-bar/club after snack, do this and then get home safely for a long nights sleep ftw."}
{"text":"Solid. Love the Chicken Gyro and Chicken Gyro Salad. Portions are solid, everything tastes fresh, meat is juicy and crispy, great people who work in here, and open late - what more could you want. Easily some of the best/most consistent Gyro I've had in the city."}
{"text":"The best gyros I've had in Toronto. There are many places that make gyro. Nut this place is as authentic as you can get. Simply delicious."}
{"text":"Fast meals.  Very salty after taste.
The interior is Dumpy, need paint and cleaning.
Walls and broken front window."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall surprise just across from Pape station. It's the kind of busy steamy place you'd expect to find in New York or Montreal. The food is just as good as you'd expect from a storefront off St Catherine's or Times Sq. Neighbourhood gem!"}
{"text":"One of few places open for late night eats; great plus! However my chicken souvlaki was so dry I could only eat half of it. The tzatziki couldn't even save the dryness of it.  Was pretty disappointed as I've heard great things about this place. However, I would probably go back as it's open late and price is fairly cheap."}
{"text":"The best place for gyro there at Greek town nicely located outside subway station. It's the best one that nobody knows about and no one lines up for during Taste of the Danforth which makes the line up easier for me."}
{"text":"Perfect food to eat after a beer-filled St. Patty's day. The chicken kontosouvli is very tender, very flavorful and very delicious.
The price is surprisingly inexpensive considering the quality and size.
Go here for the food and the friendly customer service!"}
{"text":"We were driving at night and everything was closed. We are so lucky to have found this gem in greak town. Their chicken is a killa and i ate 2 sandwiches and took some home.  My friend had the pork and he luved it and this friend is a cook."}
{"text":"First of all, I really have yet to dislike any Souvlaki on the Danforth .. 
but this spot in particular has a special place in my heart. 'Souv Like' do NOT skimp out when it comes to the fries they add inside the pita like other joints I've been to in the past. The portions of chicken inside are very generous and full of flavour also! And the pita itself very soft and fresh! We sat and ate outside while devouring every single bite! And boy do you get your fill! 
For two chicken souvlaki pita wraps, fries, (feta inside extra charge) and two pops it came to 
16.00! The staff here are here are hospitable and very funny! Can't wait to come back !!"}
{"text":"Wow!  This was the best souvlaki/gyro I've had in Toronto. The pork kontosouvli was moist and flavourful. Make sure you get there early as there is a limited amount of pork or chicken kontosouvli available. If you are in the area. This is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Great Gyros, just like in Greece. 

Now the first thing I have to say is that don't expect too much from the atmosphere. 
It looks a little run down but don't judge a book by its cover. 

The food is really good. The gyros is like your having it near the beach in Greece on a nice sunny day. 

I had the chicken gyros and it was tender and the spices were just perfect. 

When you get the fries put the paprika and oregano on them! 

A need to try place on the Danforth!!"}
{"text":"I read that Souvlike has great authentic Greek gyros, at a good price, means I must go since theres one, no good Greek places uptown, and two good price!!!  When I got there, I was kinda surprised, it was a tiny place right across from Pape station.  My friend who used to frequent that location, said she's never even noticed it before but its been there a while.  We ordered a pork gyro and a chicken gyro.  Finally a place that puts french fries in the gyros, just like in Greece!  The gyro meats were seasoned well, and huge portions stuffed into that fresh fluffy pita bread.  I could eat this stuff for days!  This is the kind of place I like, a hole in the wall that makes AMAZING food."}
{"text":"Amazing wraps!! Got 2 chicken gyro wraps and an ice tea for $15. Reasonable prices for the portions they offer. Definite recommend if you're in the area."}
