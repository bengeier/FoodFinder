{"text":"Had an amazing Grilled Chicken Salad. Fresh, big and cheap. Our server Maria was really fun and nice."}
{"text":"Unexpected good food from local new diner!  I have to tell you I'm skeptical of \"new\" diners as most have prefabbed food that taste like it was made in a factor. NOT HERE! This is the real deal ! My family stopped for breakfast recently on a Sunday morning after a typical morning at the hockey rink. Hungrier than a bear we all ordered a different breakfast selection. Now you're saying who could screw up a breakfast. The food was great, the portions we very good and the price was excellent. The home fries were REAL potatoes and the eggs were perfect.  So now we decide to try it for an early dinner yesterday evening. Both my wife and I had the grilled chicken, hers the regular and mine buffalo, yes to my delight they offered a grilled buffalo chicken sandwich not fried! The chicken was an excellent, 2 breasts and freshly cooked to perfection, moist, not over cooked and it had that grilled flavor on the outside. My other son got the steak dinner and to my surprise the steak was so tender. My other son couldn't get away from the breakfast we had a week earlier so he went back for the standard called \"Johnny B Good\".    They have a French Fry section that is sure to please that potato lover as all their fires are fresh cut potatoes.   I would definitely give it a try as you will be pleased!"}
{"text":"Absolutely a Great place to eat at, I got the Elvis and it was very tasty. Very kind service and really good prices. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing prices... I would give the food a four out of five stars, but the prices definitely get a five out of five... A great little place with great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Tried Rodney's for the firs time on a Monday around 11am - a few tables taken along with a few seats at the counter. Nice homey feel, with big windows to let in lots of light and watch the world (6th ave. traffic) go by. And nice heavy marble tables. Had the Greek Omelette - a 4 egg omelette with lots of feta, tomatoes and onions. Well done, just like I like it. Decent home fries crisped on one side and toast. Ordered bacon and got 4 crispy strips. Waitress was very friendly and attentive. Why only 4 stars? Luke warm first cup of coffee, and white toast (asked for wheat). Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food and service was great! Sadly, the waitress we had said the restaurant will be closing for good on July 20, 2014. :("}
{"text":"Great prices, good diner feel.   (Pink and turquoise walls and car memorabilia on the walls).  Staff was very friendly and the food was good and arrived in large portions.  This place fits the diner description well!"}
{"text":"Yeah the poor place is closed. Sucks too. Their breakfast was great. Dude should have charged more. I'll never forget having a great breakfast and then getting a bill for $5."}
{"text":"I work in Coraopolis and this is myself/my co workers GO TO lunch place. Always great service, great food and inexpensive! I've had the chicken sandwich, chicken tenders, eggs, homefries, cheeseburger, grilled cheese...they're all amazing! dying to try the homemade onion rings and the salads! (though i will need to split that with a friend since they're SOO huge)"}
{"text":"Loved this place when it was open. It is open again using the name \"Tootsie's\". I assume under new ownership. Haven't tried it yet. Hopefully it will be as good as Rodney's was."}
{"text":"My husband had the No. 2 breakfast, 3sunny side up eggs, 4 slices of bacon, 2 slices of toast and a huge portion of home fries. I had a double cheeseburger with home fries. Our check was $12! Huge portions, good standard food, thick cut bacon - I would stick with breakfast. They have 4 egg loaded omelettes for $5. Great value, great waitress. Seating area is tiny so expect a wait."}
{"text":"Rodney's 701 diner has very good food and is very consistent. Their roast beef sandwich and chicken and waffles are some of the best that I have had."}
