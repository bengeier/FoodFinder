{"text":"Just came across this place randomly as I was going up Church St. It sounded so intriguing that I had to go in and give it a try. I loved it!   The service was friendly, the price was right ($4 for the lunch special), and the food was delicious. It's basically scalloped potatoes (which I haven't actually seen very often in Toronto, except at some pubs) covered in nacho toppings--there's a lot of options to choose from and a few are pretty creative. I went with one of the simpler options with chili and melted cheese. It was delicious! The ingredients were nice and fresh, there was plenty of cheese and it was completely melted (that's important). The potatoes themselves were also great; not too salty but not bland at all, not too crispy but also not too soggy--just right. You have to eat them with a fork unless you really like getting messy--either way, it's delicious.   I plan on returning and trying out some of the other options. If I went to Ryerson I'd probably go here for lunch a lot since the price is right. It also might be a good option for drunk food since they're open pretty late. It's a great unique option to shake up take-out food, especially if you're tired of the same old thing."}
{"text":"The sign has a picture of a culturally-confused potato wearing a sombrero leaning on a shamrock...  How could I not go in?  This tiny takeout place by Ryerson offers an original twist on snack food.  The menu has a long list of creative toppings that are served on scalloped potatoes instead of nacho chips.  Fresh and hot, these potatoes really hit the spot! The lunch special is dirt cheap for $4 bucks and a good sized portion.  There is a variety of toppings to choose from.   I went with the El Pollo Loco which is a popular choice.  Fried potatoes topped with: * Seasoned chicken breast * Red onion * Spicy salsa * Sour cream * Cheese  If you want fried potatoes...but something not fries, check this place out! =)"}
{"text":"A bunch of my coworkers and I went here for lunch today after I'd read some reviews on Yelp - and once I said the words \"Irish Potato Nachos\" everyone was on board.  There was no lineup when we got there and just the one guy behind the counter so we all ordered and waited about 5-10 minutes for our food to be ready. I got the Pachula Veggie Deluxe at $7.95 and all but two of my other coworkers followed suit. The other two just got the daily lunch special which was around $4.50.  Overall, interesting concept for a food place. It's not quite scalloped potatoes like others have said; scalloped potatoes are potatoes cooked in milk/cream with cheese and butter and browned under a salamander or broiler. They're incredibly decadent and rich. Irish Potato Nahcos is basically sliced potatoes with toppings. I was a bit disappointed because I was expecting more of a gooey cheesy yummy mess to be on top of my potatoes and THEN toppings, but it was good nonetheless.   My main complaint (and my coworkers agreed) was that the portion sizing wasn't really that good for what we paid. With a drink, my \"meal\" cost $10.50 and I'm barely full now; I'm sure I'll be hungry again in an hour or two. This place is generous with the toppings but not so much with the potatoes, which aren't exactly that expensive to begin with. We all finished wishing there was more in our containers.  If I were to go back (which we probably will for snacks at some point) I would go with the smaller lunch special version. its' definitely not enough for a meal, but it looked WAY more appetizing than the \"meal\" I got and it was only about $4.50 with tax. But I doubt I'll be going back here anytime soon unless one of my coworkers wants a repeat. I'll be more likely to take my $10 somewhere else and get a whole lot more food and have change leftover for dessert."}
{"text":"Irish Potato Nachos is brand new take out food joint on Church just South of Dundas.   I am not into Nachos... but as long as it is spicy... I will give it a try...   Shamrock Veggie ($5.95)  - Mmmmmmm I waited for 5 minute to have it freshly made especially for me!  - Fresh potatoes scalloped and lightly deep fried.. not oily at all, remind me of potato skins but a lot softer and fresher  - served fresh tomato, green and red pepper  - The Salsa has a kick of heat! and the Jalapeno pepper oh yummy   There are a lot of variations of how you like to dress your Potatoes..even Thai Curry!!   Nice and friendly staffs! Open till 2 AM on weekends! Great place to drop by for a after party snacks for sure!"}
