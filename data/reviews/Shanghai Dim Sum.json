{"text":"The food was solid and it was cheap.  We had plain congee, doughnut sticks, soy milk, tea eggs, vegetable buns, green onion pancakes, and bamboo shoots for less than $15, plus tips.  Better value than most food courts.  Lots of options for vegetarians.

Service is brusque and efficient."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times but I had to write a review once I had the beef noodle today (lanzhou lamien is what it was callled, I think). The noodle was amazing! It was well seasoned, the noodles had very nice consistency and it was reasonably priced. 

I usually come for dinner and order things like their xiao long bao and shrimp, which are great as well, but the noodles really takes the cake.

Also, the place is very clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Great food, good service.
Their xiao long bao are amazing."}
{"text":"Came here for the xiao long bao and was left disappointed. Only 2 out of 8 xiao long bao had soup, which most likely indicated the restaurant froze them and then steamed it when people order. 

The pan fried pork buns. The bun ratio to meat is like 4 to 1. All you see when you first bite into it is the bun and a tiny bit of pork with some juice. 

The Chinese fried rice was nice and fresh. It had just the right amount of crunchiness.

The Shanghai style savoury soy milk soup was a let down. They were missing a number of key ingredients that made this soup what it is. 

Overall this place was a miss for me after driving so far."}
{"text":"Next door to dumpling village, this place is really small.  They only have two big tables, so if you have a big group, make sure you call ahead.  

The dishes sizes are fairly small, dimsum size.  Their jian baos are nice with really soft buns.  We also ordered an eel dish that was good.  

Overall the quality of food was pretty good and the small restaurant gives an authentic feel.  However, for the the same money, you can  probably  go to a nicer restaurant that has better atmosphere with just as good food."}
{"text":"Okay, a lot of reviewers here seem to be confused about a lot of the food here. 
As someone who is born and raised in Shanghai, I can tell you that this place is about 70%~80% authentic. Their soup dumpling is really good, probably one of the best I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"The foods are ok, but the waitress simply treating you not even there. No smile no gesture, she must had a very bad day. The first order of Xiao Long Bao is very cheap, only 99Â¢. But then with their service, I don't think I will come back any time soon."}
{"text":"This place is very small and the selection of dim sum was rather limited. I did not get a good  impression when the waitress came back and indicated that some items we ordered on the menu ran out. They're named Shanghai Dim Sum...how can you run out of dim sum?"}
{"text":"Truly has a feeling of being invited to someone's home in shanghai. Small and quaint, food prepared with care. There were many flavors and delicacy that were new and delightful to me. Even being well verse in other chinese cuisine. Service was kind and generous, food came out at the right time and hot. So much to try."}
{"text":"There is one reason to go to Shanghai Dim Sum: the xiao long bao or soup-filled dumplings.  The other dishes here range from mediocre to good, but the xiao long bao are consistently excellent."}
{"text":"Went to Shanghai Dim Sum for dinner tonight at the suggestion of a friend, and here was our experience: 

Even though the restaurant was empty other than a table of 2 (it was 6:30pm), the staff was hesitant to give our party of 4 a larger table that sat 6. We assured them it was because we were planning to order so many dishes that the table for 4 would be tight and eventually they relented since there was no one else in the restaurant. 

The 4 staff members (one of whom appeared to be the owner or manager) hovered over us and kept speaking to us in Mandarin even after we apologized that we don't speak the language. 

Tried to get their attention a few times to refill our tea, but they were chatting to each other and did not assist, even as they stared at us.

One of the waitresses was picking her nose, which prompted my husband to comment that if they behave that way in the dining room, goodness knows what goes on behind closed doors in the kitchen.

The food was very good, but service severely lacking. Our party was torn as to whether we would make a return trip - the food would make it worthwhile, but it would have to be take-out."}
{"text":"Just like getting a sushi fix, I need a Siu Long Bao fix from time to time.  There are a few places around Markham and Scarborough to get good quality Siu Long Bao, and Shanghai Dim Sum is one of them.  The Siu Long Bao here may not be the winner for the thinnest skin but I love their juicy, tasty and non greasy soup fillings. With the special price on the first order, you just can't beat it.  The only draw back I had is the Seafood favor one which tasted a bit bland to me compared with the others.  Also tried the Dan Dan Noodles which is rich and flavorful but it gets a bit salty by the end.  Overall, this is a great place for cheap and good eats."}
{"text":"Their steamed soup dumplings are super yummy! You got try it. And I also like the salty soy milk."}
{"text":"The xiao long baos were not as fresh as I was anticipating.  But what did I expect for a dish of 4 dumplings for $.99 if you ordered before 10:30 am. The other items of fried turnip cake and green onion pancakes were decent. The place itself is fairly small and service is fast."}
{"text":"Super yummy and cheap Shanghainese dimsum-their xiaolongbai is too die for! Come early as they have limited seats and get packed by noon."}
{"text":"We went to Shanghai Dim Sum for dinner as recommended by a friend. I was a little skeptical initially after reading the low rating on yelp, but I'm glad that we decided to give it a try. 

I've to say they have the best xiao long bao I've had in the area! The dumplings are filled with flavourful soup. I would definitely go back just for the xiao long bao. We also ordered fish and veggie soup, preserved meat & veggie rice, and a pork rib dish (don't remember the name of it). All the dishes came out hot and fresh, I like all of them. 

Service was decent, you order by writing down the dish # on a piece of paper, so it's easy!"}
{"text":"Didn't end up eating here. Waited almost an hour to be seated even though there were a lot of seats available. They did not want my friend and I to take up a table that could seat more than 2 people. They kept cleaning and seating groups and when a two seater was open they didn't clean it right away I stead the were too occupied with the groups.
Where's the customer service? Needless to say, my friend and I decided to leave."}
{"text":"Definitely a must-try. They actually have very good food for an extremely good price. You can eat all the xiao long bao you are craving, one order is only $1.99! You cannot find a place like this anywhere else in the GTA. It can get quite busy though so there might be a bit of a wait. Whenever I'm in that area, this is the go-to place."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place so many times over the years and just tried it recently, after seeing so many IG posts about this place.

I wouldn't say the food is excellent, but for their prices, you can't wrong. They have a number of special dim sums that are around $1-3 for the first order only if you order over $5 of regular priced items. The dim sums don't taste very fresh. They're like the frozen ones found in supermarkets. I wouldn't mind eating them but not a lot.

The noodles are pretty good. I like the texture of the noodles they use. They're thin, chewy, and don't get soggy quickly. They're also pretty generous with the toppings. For the pork chop noodles, there's two pieces of pork chop. The pork chop is kind of sweet like coke chicken, which I like. 

The crispy duck is good. Lots of meat. But would've be been better if there were some buns included in the price.

3.5 stars round up to 4. Would be back occasionally to satisfy any shanghainese food cravings."}
{"text":"This place is so great. I love their xiao long bao. This is as good as the place in markham and many many people rave about, i thinnk its called ding tai fung. The place is much smaller compared, but the dishes are equally as good. Super flavorful and delishious. Their special duck is so good. I would 100% recommend this place to soeone looking for authentic shang hai food"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. We didn't know what to order so just got a combo set ($149.99) which is for 8 ppl. We were literally disgusted by every item, except for the soup-filled wontons, and the dessert at the end. The crab was also fine, but not the starch cakes that came with it. My whole family were utterly disappointed. Perhaps we chose bad selections- but it was a dinner set and u would think the resto would put guaranteed great dishes in the set? But I would think the set, which contained about 8 dishes, would be enough of a sample size to represent the restaurant..... I feel bad for bashing the food.... but just tryna keep it real on this open platform...."}
{"text":"It's alright, pretty good place for dumplings and other Shanghai cuisine. My dad said he felt like it was better in the past years, I thought most of the dishes were good except maybe two."}
{"text":"My family and I had a great lunch at Shanghai Dim Sum. Granted that the restaurant itself is tiny, the parking is annoying and they don't take reservations, we still enjoyed the food very much once we got seated.

We ordered a TON of food. We are talking about 15+ dishes (small and big) for 6 people, which ended up being about $190 with tip and tax. Everyone was extremely full and there were plenty of leftovers to take home. 

Standout dishes for me: Scrambled egg white with broccoli & crab meat, stir fried green beans with minced pork, pork rind jelly and of course their xiao long bao. We ordered the steamed and pan-fried XLB, both were great. 

The only dish that I didn't enjoy was their crispy fish with shrimp and pineapple. A little too sweet and sour for me and I also found the fish too bony and difficult to eat, even though it was deep fried. 

The 2 star reviews puzzle me. I have a feeling the 2 star reviewers put more emphasis on service and ambiance than they do for actual food taste and value. Taste and value-wise, Shanghai Dim Sum is hard to beat!"}
{"text":"Was here the other day for lunch. Food here was pretty solid. I would probably say that this was one of the better places for shanghai food in the GTA.

Ordered the typical xiao long bao, pot stickers, savoury sticky rice, jellyfish, and red bean pancake. All tasted really good. The xiao long bao was hot and juicy. I liked how the pork was really lean and the soup inside tasted delicious. The only downfall was the dough because it was a bit too thick for my liking. 

Staff was friendly but they were way understaffed as only one person was serving the entire restaurant. We asked for hot sauce twice and ended up getting it from a next table ourselves. 

Overall, I really enjoyed the quality of the food here."}
{"text":"They have a xiao long bao special where the first one order is a buck! Four per order. Which is pretty good. They are pretty soup filled and don't break apart easily, so if you like your XLB with a thicker skin this would be it. I could come here and just order that. 

In terms of the food times that have been mentioned, cold dishes will obviously come out first and depending on preparation time things can take a while. I don't find this out of the ordinary or a make or break thing as long as some dishes are in front of me to nibble on I'm a happy camper. Their other dishes are pretty good quality, especially the noodles.  I'm a fan. 

The place is pretty tiny and does get packed so go early."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food is consistently good. Their xiao long bao are really delicious with thin skin and flavourful filling. Their ramen is also really delicious as well. 

Not unexpected, wish the staff would smile a little more and be more friendly."}
{"text":"Didn't like the food much . The restaurant isn't that good looking either. There were some weirdos in the restaurant but the lady serving us was very nice."}
{"text":"Ordered the Steamed buns for $0.99 (awesome deal btw) and Shanghai noodles. Very delicious, and actually very cheap for a Shanghainese restaurant. Highly recommend!!! I'll be back here soon"}
{"text":"First off, I found a spec of green stuff in my salty soymilk.    Assuming a authentic Shanghainese salty soymilk is loaded with pickled veggies and Chinese doughnuts, it came completely bland, plain and barely warm.   Being my 1st time trying this place, I will NEVER return.    The waitresses are horrible!!!!   If you question them on anything, they reply with major attitude like the customers are stupid and we should know.    Terrible experience and to be honest, my family and I were not impressed by the food at all.   Not worthy of taking attitude for.   Gv yr business to another deserving establishment."}
{"text":"Great place for Shanghai food!

Reasonably priced with good service.

Will return with more friends and family."}
{"text":"You're telling me you can get 4 xiaolongbao for 99 cents? (First order, after is 2.99). Sign ME UP FOR PORK HEAVEN. 

The resto has decent food, and bang for buck is the key here. 

Soup dumplings: pork is a bit too firm, skin is thin and soup is delicious. 
Beef noodles: TENDER beef chunks and a soup that is salty deliciousness will beg to be drunk
Pan fried dumplings: would avoid - a bit under cooked so the skin was not crispy enough 
Burgers: decent - never liked chinese burgs as much as American 

Come here with buddies and order a feast. Leave with a slight lighter wallet. Not for people that have saint laurent wallets...head over to dtf."}
{"text":"Delicious and always consistent. 

This is my boyfriend and mine go-to Shanghainese Food joint, especially when I am craving Xiao Long Bao (Soup Filled Dumplings). This place definitely has THE BEST, let me repeat, THE BEST Xiao Long Bao I have ever had in Toronto. Not only is the dumpling filled with hot, flavourful soup but the skin of each dumpling is perfectly thin and strong at the same time that the chopsticks will not rupture the dumpling upon contact.

Believe it or not, this is super important because I'm sure we all want the dumpling and soup to stay in tact. :) We like to bite off the top of the dumpling where the skin is in a knot to make a hole to let the soup inside cool down a bit before digging in.

Anyways, I usually come for a quick lunch and between my boyfriend and I, we get the B-2 Soup Filled Dumplings with Pork,this B-16 Seasame Pancake with Shredded Pork inside, the Sliced Pork with Garlic Chili Sauce and one carb-filled item (usually a noodle).

Everything is made fresh and so tasty and for what we order (comes to around $25), we are more than stuffed.

I am waiting for an ocassion to come here for dinner and try out their other menu items since they always look so good.

The service is good and quick and the staff always look very friendly.

I would definitely recommend coming here for Shanghainese food!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and staff doesn't even speak English or Cantonese.  I didn't understand a word they were saying and it was even harder to ask for an extra bowl and chopstick. the staff were slow and show them chatting with each other and cracking jokes now and than when everyone is looking for them.  Food itself was bland and presentation was terrible.  Don't think i will come back for a 2nd visit with this bad service and subpar food."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty okay, but this place is not just Shanghai foods, but a mixture of different Chinese regional foods. 

The staffs are pretty friendly and knows the menus. The dining place is clean and neat but the bathroom is ... don't wanna use it if not a must.

The utensils and chinawares are old and worn  out...my tea cup is cracked and leaking... almost cut my lips......

The food is a hit and miss, the Shanghai mix stir fried noodle was a miss, too sweet made the flavor hard to swallow... the steam Shanghai dumplings' skin is is too think. 

The stir fried veggies and drunken chicken is pretty good. 
The Hong Kong style milk tea us also a good drink. Give it a try if you are in the Pacific Mall..."}
{"text":"Busy on a Friday night and staff was always too busy to look over to our table. However, the wait was worth it since the Xiao long bao special was really good ( $1 for 4 XLB). We also got the Dan Dan noodle but it was too thick and oily for my liking. The spicy beef noodle was pretty good. I would come back again to try their other items."}
{"text":"I really like this place's dumplings and fried buns, they are always delicious and piping hot.  The price is quite reasonable with the first order of the steamed dumplings at really low price for first order.  The decor has a feel of the old shanghai with wooden fan on the ceiling and a really old style radio.  The service was good too.  The wait time for food is reasonable.  The noodle with soy sauce and scallions was really delicious.  The soup with minced pork, egg drop and cilantro was really good and not too thick.  Sometimes, other restaurant would put too much cornstarch and the soup wouldn't taste good and this place just have the right balance. This is a place that I would frequent for the price and food quality."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"The XLB are pretty good. 

Apart from that, everything else is mediocre:
-sweet & sour pork in particular was terrible. It kind of taste just like batter... I could see some meat inside, but couldn't taste any. It was probably the worst I've ever had
-Shanghai noodles too were nothing special
-Fish soup (with the Sichuan pepper corns) was not great either

I definitely will not be back"}
{"text":"This place is very consistent.  We always order one of each of the \"specials\".  Steamed xlb, pan fried mini buns, etc.  Portions for the regular dishes are always quite substantial and well made.  They usually have a promotion for \"buy one dish and get a different dish free the next time you come back\".  This is such a good way to make you a repeat customer because you have about two weeks to claim your freebie.  

We usually order the cumin fried chicken, deep fried duck, pork belly, etc.  We just discovered the hot pot of spicy beef with yellow bean sprouts.  There was so much broth/soup left so we brought it home.  We boiled some noodles et voila!  Spicy beef noodle soup!  The meal that kept on feeding us.  :)

Highly recommended if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Early bird specials (before 11am or 10am? I forget) for the soup buns are excellent. My mom and I had an excellent meal and were full for maybe around 12 dollars.

Quality: 8/10. Service: 7/10. Value: 9/10. Overall: 8/10 (not an average)."}
{"text":"A great place to have breakfast, lunch and dinner. This place opens from 8am and they have a special priced menu in the morning for early birds. Came here for lunch with a few friends and we were very satisfied with its food. The shanghai stemmed/fried buns are amazingly delicious and the jelly noodle mixed with spicy sauce was on point as well.

Will definitely be back to try some more dishes."}
{"text":"This place is inside the plaza of 330 Highway 7 East. There are big red signs of the restaurant both in English and in Chinese, so it's quite hard to miss.

My friends and I ordered several dishes, all of them are Shanghainese style (keeping to the tradition of eating what they make best).

We ordered two different sets of xiao long bao (You can Google how it looks like). One set is the traditional type with pork inside, and the other set is with crab meat inside. They are both made well, and I would say the one with crab meat is even better. However, the set with crab meat comes in six pieces, whereas the other more traditional set comes in eight pieces. The downside to the xiao long bao is that the skin is kind of weak, and the juice (or soup) from inside easily leak. I've had xiao long bao from other places where the skin remains strong, in-tact, thin and still keeps the juice inside from leaking. Customers need to be mindful about that.

We also ordered duck and beef noodle soup (or my friends like to refer them as \"BNS\"). The duck is very sweet and well cooked. The BNS is quite different from other BNS I've had in other shanghainese-style restaurant. This kind of BNS uses a more thin type of noodle, very close to a ramen-style noodle. I prefer it this way because it is chewy and thin. Most BNS uses the thick shanghainese noodle (just a tad thinner than udon). I know that some of my friends prefer the thicker kind.

On top of these dishes, we also ordered Guo Tie (again you can Google this) and spicy tofu. Guo Tie is a deep fried dumpling that has pork inside it. The Guo Tie served from this restaurant is massive and comes in four pieces. The spicy tofu isn't the kind of crispy type that I prefer. 

Last but not least, we ordered dessert and it is a big giant doughnut-like food with egg and red beans inside. I believe it is one of the only few desserts that they serve in their menu and it is worth a try."}
{"text":"Their Xiao Long Bao is pretty good, (not DTF good but better than a lot of other places) and the service is quick and efficient. Its typical Asian service so don't expect them to wait on you but they're quick to respond when you flag them down. Plus they're running specials right now, 4 XLBs for $0.99 (first order). I especially like their Dan Dan noodles. Perfect amount of peanut sauce and their noodles were well done. Also it was just the right amount of spicy too. Great little place. (There is parking but spaces are limited)"}
{"text":"Yum!  We've been eyeing this place since it opened and we're so glad we were able to finally make a trip here.  We came here for Friday night dinner and managed to snag a table for two immediately.  Five minutes after we sat down, people were starting to line up at the door.  The place was fairly cozy, the exterior gave the restaurant a deceptively large appearance.  It seemed someone made some effort on the decor; interesting prints of women from Shanghai's golden era were interspersed throughout the walls.

The service was surprisingly kind and efficient; no attitude and very congenial wait staff.

The food... mmm.  I'm a sucker for xiao long bao and this place is very tasty.  The little soup filled buns came steaming hot in short order followed quickly by the Royal Dumplings which were not what I expected at all.  They were these three yummy 'open faced' soup filled morsels of deliciousness!  They did not look like dumplings and in fact did not look like anything that I have ever seen.  While I gladly chowed them down, I thought it was a bit pricy for just three pieces.  The Shanghai stir fried rice cakes were very well made.  This is a simple dish that is often marred by too much oil or too hard rice cakes.  Here, the rice cakes were soft, the meat-veggie-rice cake ratio was well-balanced and there was not remnant of oil soup on the plate after the dish was inhaled.  Finally, we had the pan fried buns.  They were probably the best that I have ever had.  The white dough was springy and soft, the meat filling delicious and the oil was kept to a minimum.  

This place has me dreaming of  xiao long bao and pan fried buns.  I will be coming back here very soon!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre. The wait time for the food was long and worst of all was their terrible customer service."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday at noon when our regular Dim Sum place was too full, and it turned out pretty well. I haven't had Shanghai style in a while, mostly because of the heavier use of wheat dumpling wrappers and noodles as opposed to rice wrappers and noodles in other cuisines, but there was enough selection that I could eat here comfortably.
We had the pork jelly cake to start with - nice flavour and texture. The bean curd rolls and meatballs soup was also very nicely flavoured and the rolls and meatballs were really good. Then we had the countryside style stir fried pork - really good, great mix of flavours and textures; the chili shrimp - nicely cooked but I didn't like the particular combination of too sweet and too vinegary and not enough heat; the stir fried beans with minced pork were probably my favourite - great flavour, perfect heat, tender and flavourful pork - mmmm!; and the fried rice with egg and green onion was also really good - perfectly cooked with a nice balance of flavours.
The place is small and ordering is off the menu, not with the carts, but the food was good, service was prompt, and the price was in range with the local competition, so I am pretty sure we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a place where they serve dim sum from Shanghai. Unlike canto-style dim sums, Shanghai dim sum is represented by xiao long baos (soup dumplings) and have less seafood ingredients.The xiao long bao (small soup dumplings) are pretty average. The other items are overly greasy, and made it difficult to taste anything underneath the grease. Service is typical of an average Asian restuarant. If you want a superior shanghai dim sum experience, I'd suggest Ding Tai Fung at FMP."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite place for Shanghai food. $1 juicy dumplings is such a steal! Diverse selection on the menu to meet all your craving needs. Good portion size and flavourful dishes. Go early to avoid waiting for a table; place is usually packed!"}
{"text":"Came here on a late Saturday night just before closing. Happy to learn they still have the siu long bao for $0.99 (First order). They also have a $0.99 special for the 1st order of the fried version (2 pieces).

We always order the same traditional dishes such as the siu long baos, beef jello, pork slices with cucumber in garlic sauce and the pork belly/tofu/bamboo soup. 

Solid 4 stars for the consistency of the food over the past 3 years.  Extra 1 star because the lady manager is always so pleasant and welcoming, which keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"The Shanghai Style Salty Soy Milk looked exactly like it did in the picture on the menu.  It was a bowl of soy milk with some spicy oil on the surface with some fried dough fritters placed into it.  It was quite interesting!  The soy milk was hot and it contrasted with the oil and dough fritters that had soaked everything up.  It was a new dish for me."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5 but I feel generous today.

Been here many times with my family. If you know what you are ordering, this place is great. Like most Chinese places, the menu options are endless and some dishes are bound to be a miss. But for the most part this place is a hit.

Their best dishes are probably the crispy duck, their lamb noodle, and their dumplings. Their XLB is some of the best and they have this very unique deal where the first order is $0.99, 2nd order is more expensive, and 3rd and above at regular price. So you actually get more bang for your buck if you come in smaller groups!

Their worst dishes would probably be their ramen dishes, their veggies, and their fried chicken.

This place also has a monthly buy 1 get 1 free deal. You buy their promo item(s), and you get a card and can get the same item for free on the next visit. It's very enticing!

Service wise it's very Chinese. Don't bother asking for napkins and takeout boxes. Just go get it yourself. I don't mind. If you are Chinese enough to come to a place like this, it really shouldn't bother you. Just spelling it out for those not experienced with Chinese level service.

This place is great value. Morning time they have some $1 dim sum selections too. It's a very well rounded restaurant."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday and we've made reservations but they didn't even bother to reserve a table for us. Leaving us waiting about 10-15 mins for a customer to leave. They did offer us a menu and asked us to write down our order so they could get started with our dishes.

The restaurant is very very tiny and cramped. Could barely walk inbetween the tables and your chairs or tables are bumping against someone else's. 

We tried some other dishes as well besides the dimsum. The chili chicken soup was cold, not to my expectations. They basically dumped chili oil in it without other much preparation. The chicken itself was alright.

I liked the spring roll because it was stuffed with chinese cabbage and some type of meat. What stood out the most for me was the beef noodle soup! The beef noodle soup was so delicious! The noodles seemed like it was hand made (not bought). The broth was rich as well. The noodles really made it.

As for the xiao long bao, they were alright! I felt like I've had better elsewhere :/ . 

I did not like the shiu mai because it was stuffed with rice with a shrimp on top. Definitely like hong kong style shiu mai better! 

Nothing was awesome except for the beef noodle soup but I won't be coming back just for that - since the service and parking was pretty crap, everything was cramped and the toilet didn't even have a proper handle (look at pics) to flush it with! 

Which is why I'm not sure why there was a huge line of people waiting outside the doors when we left... 

Parking is really small and garbage as well, so park next door where the Jesse's is! There's a huge parking lot there!"}
{"text":"I have no complaints in terms of the food and the freshness of it. My biggest gripe with this place is the service. I'm not quite sure how they manage their guest but this place definitely sucks at it. We arrived there and waited for 15 minutes. A lady walks up and waits in front of us, but thinking nothing of it we stood there. Funny part was there wasn't a person there to help manage the tables and who came first. So this middle aged biatch took our spot. We were pretty disappointed with that, but I figured I won't be bothered with it.. Because after a minute, we got a better spot.. Beside the biatch's table. Asides from this turd, the food was good! We ordered 3 dishes and all 3 came out perfect! I don't have pictures, but next time I go I'll remember to snap some up! :)

Make sure you don't go on a busy night because you won't be greeted when you go in.. Neither will you be seated in an orderly fashion."}
{"text":"Now here's a pleasant, refreshing find--a *quiet*, cozy Dim Sum restaurant that doesn't have the usual, roaring din of a typical Chinese restaurant! The Dim Sum are big, juicy, and tasty mouthfuls done in a very unique style; not your standard, same-old, same-old. If you haven't tried this place, TRY THIS PLACE...!"}
{"text":"Ghetto small tiny shack but super tasty and delicious Shanghai style dimsum. Dont expect amazballz service ok? Because this place is super small and its runed like a mom and pop shop. Cant expect ambiance and service in a ghrtto looking place like this one. My friend took me here once before, the wait time is a bit since it's a very tiny place and there's no point to make a reservation so don't bother... but it's worth it for the price you pay especially in Scarborough. The place is nothing fancy ... super casual and looks like a hole in the wall. But if you love'dem soup filled Dumplings, definitely check this place out. 

I give this place a 3 our of 5 star because it does lack the service. And the place can take a small reno if you know what I mean. Toilets toilets toilets ... dem toilets need help! Overall the food is good... I'd come back here in my Pajamas Lol"}
{"text":"Small little restaurant with decent quality food. It's titled a Dim Sum restaurant but has very little selection on dim sum. They serve the classic \"Â Silk soup filled pork dim sumÂ \" which I highly recommend, and the pan fried dumplings plus other steamed buns. Our food came pretty late while we watched other people receive their orders before us, and who were also seated after us. It wasn't the best experience but I was content with my order."}
{"text":"I consider Shanghai Dim Sum one of the rising players of Shanghai cuisine in the Greater Toronto Area. This place has one of the best Siu Long Baos (Soup Filled Dumplings) that I have ever eaten. The dumplings are prepared fresh made to order, since the soup inside the dumpling can burn your tongue. (I made the classic rookie mistake, even letting it cool for at least a minute.) The other choices they have (Green Onion Pancake, Shanghai Fried Noodles, Fried Rice) are just as delicious as the soup filled dumplings. 

The service is questionable at best. The waiters were not as attentive as they should be. Even if you asked them for just a refill on tea, don't be surprised for a long wait. 

The prices for the dishes are more than reasonable. You will get value for any dish you order.  I will definitely be back for more, especially for their dumplings. The service is questionable, but the food will make up for it."}
{"text":"These people had good food but the service from the front of house staff is lousy at best. The women who wait on the diners are rude and unhelpful. It's as though you were troubling them by patronizing their business."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good Shanghai dim sum place on Sheppard in Scarborough so I browsed Yelp and went to Shanghai Dim Sum. Duh right? .  

It's a stand alone building with a very small parking lot with less than 10 spots.  Don't fret, you can park across the street.  From the outside, it looks very formal and somewhat big, but it is actually quite small inside.  While this may throw some people off, it actually makes it a bit more of a homey feel and my mom said it reminded her of some smaller restaurants in Asia.  

What we ordered: 

-Steamed crab and pork dumplings (6 pcs) - $7.99
-Pan fried pork buns (4 pcs) - $6.99
-Shanghai wonton soup (8-10 pcs) - $4.99

The prices aren't cheap here, but they aren't any more expensive than Markham DTF either.  However, I found the quality here to be much better and less salty. Markham DTF is becoming more of a mass production factory now :-(.  In addition, their menu here is a lot bigger.

The crab/pork dumplings were succulent and full of juice and flavour.  The pan fried pork buns are about $1 more expensive than Markham DTF, but the presentation and craftsmanship is so much better here.  As for the Shanghai wontons, they were basically just boiled pork and chive dumplings but made totally from scratch, including the skin.  For a price of $4.99, you can't go wrong (although I swear the menu said $5.99).  

My other super like about this place is that it opens at 8:30 in the morning 7 days a week!  WOW!! That is so early but if I worked in the area, I'd so come here for breakfast. 

My only slight dislike about this place is that it appears most of the waitstaff speak little to no English and only know Mandarin.  Not to worry.  The menu has plenty of pictures and you just write the menu item number on a piece of paper.  As long as you can gesture \"bill, and box\", and smile while doing it, they are more than accommodating.  It's not ideal, but it appears to be a family run business and it just adds to the appeal of the place.  

Verdict: Very good and will visit again."}
{"text":"I went to this place with two people. and honestly it was an average restaurant. that had the problem of terrible service. The dumplings, or soup buns whichever english translation you prefer are the highlight of the food that they offer. That is the better dishes that they serve. as it is just right, and not too salty or oily. The duck although cooked to just the right temperature and right texture, was too salty. and the cold dish in the bamboo shoots was the same. The food would've been worth a 3 or even 3.5 stars. however the service was so terrible it dropped them to a solid 2 star. 

The servers are not just rude, but also can't process orders. We had to ask 3 servers for a spoon, before we gave up and just grabbed one ourselves off a vacant table. Also the dishes they provided were dirty to start. Normally i take chinese restaurant services with a grain of salt. but this one was beyond terrible, because not just one bad server., but all their servers were bad. And to add on this is a very small restaurant that doesn't seat a lot of people. Yet they still managed to have bad service, as it was not because their too busy or other factors.  For all the gruff you would take from the servers, i would say it does not make it worth it to go to this restaurant to eat. 

I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, over the service, if they have to try the food, then get takeout. cause the grief you get is just not worth it."}
{"text":"This is second time I tried this restaurant. Service is very good and mannered. For a northern style is consider good. Still a little on the oily side but not as much as other northern style Chinese restaurant. The place a very nice inside but little small. I wouldn't mind this again since most of the restaurant in that area is crap too."}
{"text":"TLDR: Come here before 11 am and it is probably the cheapest Shanghai style restaurant in the GTA. Dumplings as low as $0.99 and buns are $1 each before 11 am. 

$23.67 - this was my bill before tips but including taxes.  It included the following:
1. Corn congee - $1
2. Xiao long bao (4) - $1
3. Xiao long bao with crab meat (4) - $1.99
4. Pan Fried Xiao long bao (4) - $2.99
5. 2 steamed veggie buns - $1 each
6. 1 steamed veggie bun - $1 each 
7. Jelly pork or something - $3.99
8. Noodle bowl with bean curd - $5.99

We had no idea about their specials and arrived at around 10:45 and just furiously ordered random specials. 

From what I gather the 0.99 Xiao long bao were the best values since you get 4 dumplings and also the best tasting. They also looked like they had a lot of soup in them and the skin was very thin.  The steamed buns had a nice thick, but not too thin wrapping and the veggie bun was filled with preserved veggies.  

While the noodle bowl with bean curd for $5.99 was the most expensive, the noodles weren't your typical thick Shanghai or udon noodles, nor were they ramen. The best way to describe it is a thicker vermicelli, not really al dente, but not soggy either.  The bean curd had a great flavour to it, as did the broth.  

In terms of the pricing, items 1 to 6 listed above were the pre 11 am specials.  All the XLB (xiao long bao) pricing is for the first. If you order more, then you pay $1 more (i.e. normal XLB would be $1.99 for every order thereafter).  However, all the buns and congee are $1 each and you can order as much as you want. 

The only thing severely lacking is service.  We had to call the waitresses a few times and while they were busy, we still got our food. The only thing is that when we had to wait for a table, they would say the number in Mandarin only and not Cantonese or English which got me really nervous that we'd be waiting for seats for a while.  

Verdict: Very good food, plenty of vegetarian dishes at super cheap prices as long as you are willing to put up with sub-par service.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"I reallyyyy wanted some XLB so saw the high Yelp rating and figured this was the place to go. And the XLB - I went for the silk skin pork one, the 99-cent special one - were fantastic. Hot, fresh, good amount of soup and just enough meat inside. The dumpling itself had a nice amount of chew and was definitely soft and silky.

I also got to try, and really enjoyed, the green onion pancake (one of the best I've had and I order these everywhere, flaky and perfectly done), the pan fried XLB (honestly maybe better than the silk skin, so crispy and delicious), and the noodles with green onion oil sauce (omg the burnt green onions, so good - very oily though!). One person at my table ordered the beef with tangerine peel and it was good, but not the main attraction. I really wanted to try the sweet corn pancakes but we were just too full.

4/5, though, for the parking (godawful, I'm sorry - I'd rather take Viva) and relatively limited menu, which is mostly dumplings and noodles (don't make the mistake I did and come here with people used to Canadian-Chinese). I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of my go-to places for xiao long bao in Toronto! It's either here or Ding Tai Fung, which is a few minutes away at First Markham Place. I find this restaurant to be more affordable and enjoy the xiao long bao a little more here because the soup inside is extremely flavourful. 

Ordered all 3 of the silk skin xiao long bao (pork, pork and crab, and pan-fried). The first was .99 while the other two were 1.99. I don't know where else you can get 12 XLB's for 5 bucks, so that was awesome. 

I also tried the normal skinned XLB (pork). The skin was thicker (more like those on traditional dumplings) and I would prefer this as well as the pan-fried silk skin XLB overall. 

Also ordered the Shanghai fried noodles, and some fried dough sticks to dip in hot unsweetened soy milk. Came here with the boyfriend and for about $30, we were both full and had leftovers. 

Very affordable and recommended!"}
{"text":"Brand NEW Shanghai restaurant in the Sheppard & Brimley area of Scarborough and it looks like possible competition for Asian Legend diagonally across the intersection.

A SMALL parking area but don't worry you can park at the plaza across which has a few more spots.  The Chinese lettering on the sign is done very beautifully.  Also the two lions guarding the entrance adds a very nice touch for welcoming customers.

Inside has some wall hangings and settings that represent Shanghai itself.  Five 2-seaters are aligned along the windowed walls while in the middle holds Four 4-seaters and the back where Two 8+ seaters are available.  Big group?  Try to get the 8+ seater with the FAUX leather seats.  :p

There are 4 servers this night which means at least one is fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin or English.  Pretty decent service but this place is small-ish so TIGHT spaces to maneuver around for everyone.

Drunken Chicken($5.99) and Boiled Duck w/Salty Taste($5.99) were 2 COLD Starters that are more on the average end.  

The Beef Noodle Soup($6.99) is a TOTAL miss as the noodles are below average and the soup doesn't have the flavours nor was there even a decent hint of spiciness.  The Beef was the better item of this dish but still not worth ordering, so just SKIP noodles here altogether.

Mini Shanghai Style Soup Filled Dumplings w/Pork($7.99/8) otherwise know as Xiao Long Bao was A-OK and the juice within had hints of sweetness rather than purely savoury.  

Fried Egg w/Special Sauce($11.99) was A-OK as well and hidden inside was tiny bits of white fish.  If you didn't pay attention you wouldn't notice the fish but I tasted the FISH flavour so I looked hard and deep.

Hot & Sour Soup($3.99/small) was pretty good with some Pork, Shrimp, Tofu, etc...  It had good quantity and ingredients but what was missing is the HOT part of the description however simply ask for more Chili Oil.

We ended with Glutonous Rice Ball w/Black Sesame in Gui Hua(Osmanthus) Wine($4.99).  It came to the table with great scent/fragrance and it tasted pretty good.  The only downside if I was picky was that it lacked a little on the wine part as others do it up stronger.

All I can offer is an A-OK for now as I still cannot gather what their STRENGTH or what makes them special compared to neighbourhood North Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"A small location on sheppard, Shanghai Dim Sum seems like a family owned restaurant who has hired more employees due to the amount of customers that come here. I definitely recommend you to come early because starting at 6:30pm or 7:00pm, it begins to get packed. 

I love the xiao long bao as it is filled with soup - not all places can make good xiao long bao. Their ??? is very tasty as well. There are a bit of green onions sprinkled on top and only the bottom is crispy, the top is slightly crispy, not too soft but not overboard. Loved it! We also always get the beef with noodles in soup. This was mediocre, seemed to taste similar to other places. 

I wouldn't say their prices are super expensive or super cheap. They are cheaper than ding tai fung, but there are cheaper restaurants in Markham. Pretty small restaurant, but good quality. The chef really adheres to the amount of customers in the store but making their dishes well for a small group of participats."}
{"text":"Didn't know this place opened so long ago, I always thought it was new, even though i am aware that this restaurant is just the branch of the sister shop in Scarborough.

The siu long bao were of great quality, four in each crate for only $0.99 (plain) or $1.99 (crab meat) for the first crate and for each additional crate, it is $3.99 or so. These siu long bao are large in size and THE SOUP was absolutely delicious. The plain one definitely had dong gu mushroom as a soup base and the crab meat one tasted sweet like crab meat or at least crab shell. The siu long bao were wrapped beautifully with perfect folds.

I'm a little surprised to read a lot of comments regarding how rude the waiters are and how they yell at you for not being able to speak Mandarin because when I went, there was at least one waitress who is able to speak Cantonese to us and the other waiters were super nice as well.

Other dishes include rice with Chinese sausage bits and dice bok choy, a green onion pancake and a LARGE bowl of ramen. ALL of these were delicious and not one dissapointed me, which I was delighted to eat.

Best part?! ALL five dishes came down to $24.50 before tips, including tax. WHAT?! Man, I have to hit up this place more often before the xiao long bao special disappears."}
{"text":"Salty soy milk is now $3.99. Still good. For more info on that one, check my original review. 

Xiao long bao are cheap! They have two kinds. Q1 (pork) is $0.99 for the first order. Q2 (pork and crab, I believe) is $1.99 for the first order. Q3 (pan fried pork) is $1.99 for the first order as well. Each order comes with 4 XLB. You can order all 3 (Q1, Q2, and Q3) for a total of 12 XLB for just under $5 before tax! Good amount of juice in those things. Yum yum. Additional orders will not be at this discounted price, but that first order is such a cheap eat. 

There are a number of Shanghai Dim Sum Locations. This one's kinda quaint. This looks the inside of someone's house, if said someone had many tables in their dining room. The tables are a little cramped. Service is not bad. We did have two oopsies though. We wanted to order something. The server took our order, then told us they didn't have that item. However, we were not asked if we wanted to replace it with anything. Huh. Well, if you don't want us to order more food, or order enough for the two of us to eat, then I guess that's that. Nah. We asked for a menu so we could get more food. Then, while we were eating, one of the servers brought over a dish we didn't order. It smelled great though. Sweet and sour ribs. Mmmm.

This is the closest location to my house, so I'll be back when I want XLB's."}
{"text":"Compounding specials is fun. I like how they have 3 different types of soup dumplings (xiao long bao) on special right now, and one can order all three at the special prices. This is a promotion for their silky skin xiao long baos, if I recall correctly. Basically, for the first order of each (4 xlb's per order), there's a special price. $0.99 for pork, $1.99 for pork and crab, and $1.99 for pan fried. For those prices, I'd say those xlb's were a steal. I would not, however, intentionally come for them at regular price. The wrappers were a tad thicker than I'd like them. Eat them while they're piping hot though. That's when they're the best.

Also had a number of other things:

Drunken chicken ($6.99)  - not drunk enough. Not enough rice wine flavor. Chicken wasn't particularly tender. Also not cut cleanly. Pieces still stuck together. 

Snow pea shoots ($12.99) - sauteed with garlic. Good portion for price. 

Braised pork belly noodle in soup ($6.99) - single large slice of pork belly. Fat was tender. Meat was not really. Noodle base was amazing though.

Chinese burgers/minced meat with cilantro and green onions in sesame pancake ($6.99/2) - Not among the better ones I've had in Toronto. Lots of sesame though.

Spicy battered fried fish ($12.99) - promotion going on. Buy an order, get a coupon that gets you a buy one get one free on this item the next time you order it. Portion was alright. Fish was creamy. Not spicy. Slightly cumin-y. Batter was a tad thick.

Salty soy milk ($3.99) - I love salty soy milk. This had soy flavor in a good way. Almost floral. Chili oil, dough fritter slices, preserved veggies and possibly some seaweed, dried shrimp, and green onions make this almost like a soup. So comforting. Mmmm.

Red bean pancake ($4.99) - a tad oily, but not bad. 6 decent sized pieces. Red bean filling wasn't too sweet, which makes it a plus in my books.

Mostly positive stuff. Would order everything but the drunken chicken, fish, and the burgers again.

And a random thought. Why put 'guest' in your WiFi network if you don't intend on letting your guests use the WiFi?"}
{"text":"First bad review i have written.

Tried out this place for weekday lunch.  Actually quite crowded.  But waitresses were extremely rude.  Asked some questions about menu and response was did u not read the menu?

Tables are jammed packed together and not a comfortable atmosphere at all.

Stir fried rice cakes so salty we did not finish.  Portion was rather small as well.
Beef noodle was average.
the only tasty item was xlb.

Definitely not returning for 2nd visit when there are so many better options or competitors in the scarb/ mkm area."}
{"text":"This place use to be so good but this time that I went it's such a disappointment. The ????had a thick, lumpy sauce that it had too much? also you can see the oil that is all over the dish. 

Let's talk about dumplings, the wrap was so thick that I had to take a bigger bite that usual just to see the inside of the dumpling. I got the one with snow crab and there wasn't much in it. Back in the olden day the snow crab meat was all in your face after that initial bite. This is I only saw a couple strands of the snow crab meat... the soup/ meat juice was half of what it use to be too. It's such a disappointment because I loved this place...

Next dish ????, it tastes just like you can get it at other restaurant so it wasn't a disappointment nor success."}
{"text":"Come in with the right expectation and you won't be disappointed. Keep in mind that you are not here for the great service but more of an authentic Chinese restaurant experience which means great food, cheap and shitty service. Food is great and there is nothing to complain about when dumplings are $1 for 4 pieces. Fried rice was also well cooked- will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place is a total diamond in the rough. Come on in (preferably for breakfast on or earlier in the day), find an open table, and just make yourself comfortable. The interior of the restaurant is quite bright and easy on the eyes, and the tables and booths are laid out nicely. Husband and I came here for breakfast one morning. I completely forgot that I had bookmarked this place a while ago, but once I thumbed through the pictures, I remembered why. We also came across a local blogger that positively wrote about his experiences.

Growing up with a Shanghainese mother, wonton soup, steamed xiao long bao, and jiu cai he zi (leeks and egg pockets) were a common theme. As much as I try my best to make these little delicacies at home, it's still not the same. Shanghai Dim Sum does a pretty good job, and  we thoroughly enjoyed our time here.

The XLB that i got was their silk skin version, though they do have their regular version. If you come in the AM, the pricing is incredible at $1 for their straight up pork version. Broth is piping hot and great aromatic pork bone flavor. Be careful as it is REALLY hot. Bonus that they don't fall apart and the texture of the skin was just thin enough but chewy at the same time. We ordered 1 steamed container, and there were 4 pieces. The ginger vinegar mixture was pretty good, but I wish there were slivers instead of grounded up ginger.

The wonton soup was fantastic, and one bowl was plenty for the both of us to share. The seaweed threads were varied and plentiful, and the broth was clear and seasoned nicely with a pork and shrimp base. Small dried shrimp accented the texture and flavor of the wontons.

The leek and egg pockets were probably the weakest out of the 3 that we had, but they were still very good. The mixture was on point with vermicelli threads and nicely minced leeks. The pocket itself was a little on the thicker side than what we like, but since it wasn't oily, they get bonus points for that.

Hot tea served in large pot is placed on each table, and don't make the silly mistake like I did of pouring from high up - a watery mess will await you! ;)

Final bill came to be around $12 CAD for the both of us. Well worth the price, and would definitely recommend to those who are looking to have some tasty Shanghainese staples in a convenient location off Hwy 7. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite soup dumpling restaurant until they have changed their chef. We came here on Friday morning and they have this breakfast menu before 10:30 am. One side of the menu is basically $1.  The price is cheap but the food was terrible. The fillings of the soup dumpling was tasteless and the skin is too thick. We ordered green onion pancake but they deep fried it and the whole pancake was basically soaked in oil. Worst green onion pancake ever! Seats are tight and servers was rude. This place is terrible to go if it's not the $1 menu. There's nthg I could suggest at this place anymore since the old chef is gone."}
{"text":"This review is for their $1.00 morning special. Their breakfast is from 9:00 am-11:00 am. 
We got three different kinds xiao long biao. The steamed pork one was 0.99 for the first order, subsequent orders are an extra dollar more. The pan fried xiao long biao for 1.99$ and the crab and pork one for $1.99. Again only the first order is $1.99 subsequent orders are around an extra dollar more. The quality of the xiao long biao of course doesnt compare to ding tai fung which costs $6.99. The skin is definitely thicker and meat is more tough. The juice is nothing compared to ding tai fung, but it comes in 4 pieces and costs $0.99 so im ok with the quality. It came in four pieces and it was nice and hot. 

We also got the warm soy bean drink sweetened for $1.00. It came in a medium bowl and it was quite tasty. It wasnt overly sweet. We also called the fried rice cake for $1.00 and it came in one piece. It was slightly salty and super crispy. Outside was crispy and inside has a gooey texture. I quite like this dish. The last thing we got was the pan fried onion cake for 1.00$/ piece. Also nicely fried but lacked the onion flavour, still good though. 

The quality definitely does not compare to traditional shanghai dim sum resturants. But the price makes up for it. We ordered all that for under $9.00 and we were super full. This is definitely an afforable resturant for shanghai morning goodies."}
{"text":"There are two locations for this restaurant, one in Richmond Hill and one in Scarborough. Me and my friend went to the Scarborough location for lunch. I have to say, this place looks really really sketchy. The outside looks old and broken. Utensils are not so clean. I got a spoon that still had oil spot left on it. The outside of tea pot is also oily and had some suspicious stain. Service is not so good neither. I felt like their servers were either not awake or had gold fish memory. Since I got the dirty spoon and tea cup, I asked for another new set. The first server never just went into the kitchen and never came back to me. Then I asked another server for help, it seemed like she went to grab me new utensils but then it turned out that she grab the utensils to set up the table beside me.....So I end up grabbing a new spoon from a table that hadn't been seated. Even then the server complained about why I grab the other table's spoon. I don't know how many server I have to go through to just get a freaking spoon, but I just want to eat my soupy steam bun before it get cold!

Anyway, service aside, food was OK. I like their soupy steam bun. We ordered the pork one with fake crab, that was tasty. The crispy duck has good texture, crispy skin and the meat is tender. However, me and my friend both think it is a little too salty. We also ordered a cold bamboo shoot dish. That is oily and sweet, not my type of taste.

If they can improve the service and the hygiene, I would like to recommend this place to my friend. I think I will try their Richmond Hill location next time to see if it is better."}
{"text":"I have debating wether to review this place for a while because i want to keep it a HIDDEN GEM - its that good. It's own stand alone building and its so easy to pass by it many times and not realize its there. They have english on their menu so it makes it easy for everyone. Their service is ok - like any other chinese place.

The steamed buns are a must get - and have them with either the spicy pork belly and cabbage stir fry or stewed pork belly with beancurds. Its WAY better and authentic than anything you can get at momofuku or bahn mi boys.

The carb and pork xiao long bao is so delicious, hot and juicy, I have serious cravings for them when I am away. Their fish, veggie and eggdrop soup hits the spot in my belly. They also have a peppercorn pickled veggie and fish soup - really bol flavour and really spicy the way I like it. Their cold pork and cucumber salad is also one of my favourites - its covered in bright red chilli oil, spicy lovers only!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars : Can't find these 0.99 & 1.99 breakfast deals anywhere else in Richmond Hill, plus the Xiao Long Bao's (XLB) were tasty even at that price. Hot or cold sweetened / unsweetened soy milk at $1 single serving. There were several other items available for a dollar / couple of dollars. 

Was there about 9.30am on a Friday so I still found parking near the restaurant. Took the last booth in the restaurant, leafed through the menu filled with coloured photos (liked that) and wrote our order on the slip.

Delicious pan fried XLB arrived first, followed by Chicken Congee that was nothing to crow about. We also ordered a glutinous rice roll stuffed with a doughstick & pork floss ??. The other XLB orders came out piping hot in their steamers and we were astonished at the size of our chilli cabbage dish (dinner portion size). 

Complimentary tea was kept warm in a thermos pot (liked that) so we didn't have to bug the servers for hot tea when we finished our soy milk. 

Our experience was pretty good till the end of our visit: they started clearing our table without asking if we were done, and there were other tables available in the restaurant ie. we were not in the way of someone else waiting to dine there. Suggest they be more flexible in these circumstances."}

I've been craving proper Shanghainese cuisine for a while and one of my friends recommended we go check this place out. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. 

I went with a few friends that don't speak or read Chinese and the menu is extremely friendly, there are plenty of pictures and everything is well labeled. 

The cost is reasonable, around $5-10/dish (excluding the specials). The quality and portions are great. 

The decor doesn't make it stand out in any way in particular, but it does have a 90s Chinese family restaurant type of vibe. The paint choice is a little loud, but not oppressive. 

The service here was alright and the food didn't take long to get to the table.

The food itself was great, we ordered a variety of dishes, some not typical of Shanghai, because my friends were craving some Northern Chinese food. The soup dumplings (we had the regular and the silk skin) were good, the regular definitely being better in terms of the dumpling skin. The sticky rice roll wasn't bad, but missed a few things to make it great. The red bean pancake was good. Ome thing that surprised me was the ma po tofu, I didn't expect it to taste like the ones I had when I was in the Szechuan province in China. Definitely impressed. The rest of the dishes were quite good. One thing I forgot to order was the kao fu, so I'll have to come back for that next time.

A great place for Shanghainese cuisine, and the flavours are great. I would definitely recommend this place. I'll definitely be back sometime."}
{"text":"This is a regular spot for us and I've never reviewed it so here we go! Looking for soup dumplings on a budget that is comparable to another local fav: Ding Tai Fung? This is it. Okay, it's not the same BUT it's worth it! You will be satisfied with their soup dumplings. Note you do not come here expecting great service. Most staff don't speak English or even Cantonese well, best to come with a Mandarin speaking person. We also love the pan fried dumplings, rice cakes and mapo tofu - really nice flavour and just enough of that numbing spice. Quick service but like I said, don't expect typical north American customer service because you will be disappointed."}

{"text":"Updating review...Dishes are good and comes out very fast. But you have to do something about their not-so-clean cups/bowls/utensils for the patrons. We had to exchange at least two bowls due to them not being clean. Plus wherever these folks who work there are from (some foreign country which speaks only that foreign language called Mandarin which a lot of us do not comprehend), they've got to learn some Canadian manners. No greeting at the door or taking us to the table. Plus no 'thank you' when we left."}

These prices are only for your first order. With such cheap prices, this is my go to place when I crave Shanghai food."}
{"text":"My favourite shanghai dim sum restaurant. Food quality is consistent, dishes come out quick, price is very fair and flavours are great. 

Only down side is this is far for me, and the Scarborough location is a tad small."}
{"text":"My father saw an ad in a Chinese newspaper for Shanghai Dim Sum, the sucker-in point being \"99 cent xiao long bao.\" So I guess it's what daddy wants.

This location is located like so many things in York Region, in a nondescript commercial plaza on Highway 7 one light east of Bayview (had to be said since it is easy to miss whilst blazing at 80km/h through this part of Hwy 7, especially when going westbound). The 99 cent special brightly marketed on the window.

Of course once we entered we learned of the real deal: only the first order of their siu long bao dumpings are charged that special promo sucker-in price; any more are charged their regular--no, scratch that, their special discounted off the regular price price.

That being said, the packed-hot-with-lots-of-soup soup dumplings themselves were not bad at all. They have a few varieties of them, which pretty much makes up the \"dim sum\" part of the restaurant. Everything else on the menu was mainly Shanghaiese fare; an entertaining mix of not-a-lot-of-much-especially-in-the-vegetables-department and vaguely worded poor English. The rice cake dish was very good, but don't get the \"wild vegetables with bean curd.\" It is just finely chopped mystery greens and stuff with little taste appeal.

The up-and-downness of the food, advertising gimmicks notwithstanding, doesn't make me want to trek up this far for it, or even Scarborough for that matter. It gets packed here nonetheless with folks more local than I. Mandarin is predominantly spoken here.

{"text":"This place is officially my favourite Siu long bao destination. I've tried so many other places and none can compare to Shanghai  Dimsum. They updated their menu and the atmosphere is much better than before. After a movie on date night I would definitely stop by! 

Order all silk skin siu long baos. Pork and crab, just pork... get it all! 

And remember if youre looking for your usual dimsum place you wont get it .. this is a different kind of style of dimsim-no hai gao or siu mai here. 

That blogto article on the best siu long bao places in toronto/gta is complete BS and written by an experienced writer who didnt do thorough research."}
{"text":"I keep coming back to this place - not for the service, but definitely for the food.  I usually go for the dim sum on the weekend.  They are usually full (a good sign), but I never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a table.  The dish that keeps bring me back is the soup dumplings.  You get 6 per order.  Careful, they are piping hot and if you bite in too soon, you will burn your mouth from the hot soup inside the dumpling.  A truly unique dish.  I also usually order a noodle dish.  Carefull about the dishes labeled spicy - they actually are spicy.  If you order any soup, note that the small size is good for 3 people.  The main entrees don't come with rice, so you would need to order that separately.  Also, they bring the dishes out in nor particular order.  Once a dish is ready, it is brought to the table. 
 Everything else on the menu is good.  I take 2 stars off for the service.  You would need to flag down waitstaff for anything (including taking your order).  Overall, a good place for a weekend meal."}
{"text":"I've been to shanghai dim sim on multiple occasions and I've always enjoyed the food here. I'll only review breakfast today.

They offer a special before 11am and you can order some traditional Chinese breakfast items for $0.99 and a select menu for 20% off. There is your typical soybean milk (sweet/unsweetened), fried dough fritter, steamed buns etc. Their dough fritters are fried nice and crispy, without being too oily. You can tell they fry it fresh, because it always soft and piping hot. They soybean milk is the just the right amount of sweetness but I always have to ask it to make it hotter. The little wonton soup, is not your typical cantonese wonton soup. These are bite-sized wontons, with no shrimp filling but it is served in a seaweed/shrimp broth. It's a light dish meant to accompany your morning meal. There is glutinous rice filled with fried dough fritter and pork floss. The rice was sticky and soft and plenty of pork floss. It was a good ratio between rice and dough fritter as well. 

Lastly, I will definitely recommend the soup dumplings (xiao long bao). I believe this is one of the best I've had in gta/toronto. The dough wrapper is thin but still kept the delicious juices intact. Yum :)

I've never had a problem with service, however I do speak cantonese and mandarin."}
{"text":"There's a lot of controversy in the reviews for this place(and many others of course). Some think they are great, other's not. Some like their staples while others don't believe they are authentic. I do however have a counter argument to all this. Firstly, although we often have an appetite for fat and sodium not all taste buds are alike; hence we have variety.  Secondly, what is authenticity? Because the very idea of that is absurd. Our food has evolved just as much or more than we have and it needs to continue to evolve like everything else. But when it comes down to it, I believe, taste is mostly all that matters.

This place tastes great!.... for the most part. Their soups and snacks all taste delicious. In comparison, I would put them slightly above average when compared to long standing Shanghainess institutions like Ding Tai Fung. Unfortunately, their steamed soup dumplings (xiao long bao) is slightly on the disappointing side. The filling is fantastic but the skin on the dumpling is unusually thick; knit picking really but that's how I am.

All in all, a go to Shanghainess place....just not for xiao long bao!"}
{"text":"99 cent dumpling special! And they taste good too. Really enjoyed the meal. They have a large variety that you don't typically see at other Shanghai places. Fish soup noodle was also delish!"}
{"text":"I always order their xiao long bao special, 4 for only $1! They also have another special, 2 pan fried buns for $1. Besides that, always have a BOGO dish that you can redeem during your next visit. Service is fast. Similar to Asian Legend but for half the price!"}
{"text":"Folks saw an ad in the newspaper for $1 dish Shanghai Dim Sum. So came here to try it out. The dim sum menu is not large. Mainly just soup filled steamed dumplings, Soy Bean Drinks, Green Onion Pancakes,Congees, & Fried Rice Cake.

So their $1 Dim Sum is only for the 1st Order only. After that it's $2.49 each and this is only for the Soup Filled Steamed Dumplings. Other items for the $1 are Soy Bean Drinks, Congee etc.

Some of the steamed dumplings were a bit dried on top, I assume some are made in advance because of the $1 deal. But still tasty regardless. 

Fried Rice Cake was interesting..shaped in a square shape and deeped fried. A bit oily but it was nice and crisp.

Their Sticky Rice Rolls and Pan Fried Dumplings are gigantic compared to other places. Again taste was not bad. 

Congee was a So So, their congee was not smooth and had whole grains of rice in it. 

Shanghai Fried Noodles, tasty but a bit too greasy."}
{"text":"The food here is quite consistent and fairly solid :) the little soup dumplings are great steamed or try pan fried! I also love the various Shang Hai style appetizers/shared snacks like bamboo shoots, pork jelly, spicy intestines, etc. 

You can get a pretty nice array of dishes for two or three people to share. Total bill around $30 for 6 different plates. Dumplings are quite filling and come to just under 2$ per 4.

I like the peanut sauce chilli see through noodles. It's 5-6$ and really yummy! Peanut sauce is very much just as you expect peanut butter tastes. Very sweet and nutty. There's tons of shredded chicken in there to keep a nice balance and some chili oil up top to break the flavors up. 

It's not the best dumplings in town but certainly the best value for what you get. Mind you it's a very small restaurant and parking is quite limited. Most nights we don't seem to have trouble though."}
{"text":"Arrived at location on Sunday, June 5, 2016 to use the free xiao long bao coupon I bought from axka app.  The server said because today is a \"holiday\" I cannot get validated for the freebie.  I spoke to the manager to inform him that today is a \"weekend\" and not a \"holiday\" like Victoria Day, he said ok he will give it to me this time. I added that there may be a wording difference and that he should get axka app to fix it.  Food was hot and fresh.  Also ordered the water boiled fish (spicy and good), the mochi ground meat (not that great), soy sauce noodles (no meat or veggies, just plain noodles, meh), and hot soya soup (good, with dough fritter). It was hot that day, looks like their AC is not working."}
{"text":"Tonight I felt like siulongbao and so I came but I ended up leaving with no siulongbao in my tummy. 

I have no doubt in their food. Even after they jacked up the price, I noticed that they slightly improved the quantity to make up for it e.g. more green onion and more dried shrimp in my noodles. 
So it's all fine.

But tonight the service TOTALLY failed.
We each ordered our own bowl of noodles and also a siulongbao to share. After we finished with our noodles the slb was still not here. Usually all the food came at the same time.

So we waited and still not here... We even heard other tables waiting for their slb.
We asked and waiter and he said there's no missing order you have to wait.
So we waited.... AND strange things happened
I saw slb went to another table and those customers came later than us.

And I called another wait staff... She saw me and then she went straight to the kitchen so I thought she knew we were waiting and went to check on our order but she didn't come out with our slb nor did she come to our table again... Basically she just ignored us.

So I decided not to wait after we saw yet another  table got the slb. 
I went straight to the counter and another slb went by and I thought oh maybe it's going to my table but nope it went to the table next to us who also came later than us. 

Not exactly sure what's wrong with their kitchen or steamer but that's not the main point....
Regardless of what's going on in the kitchen, I deserve to be informed rather than ignored. No apologies no thank you whatsoever.

U may say shouldn't expect any services at a Chinese restaurant. I guess.... Then don't expect me to tip you nor my visit again. 

***

Came here on a Friday weeknight at around 630pm; not filled; seated right away 

Food for two people: we had four different Siu long baos: one original; one crab; one seafood; and one pan fried. We also ordered a rice cake and a wo tip (pan fried dumpling).

The Siu long baos were still at promotional prices.
They are really pretty good. Piping hot and each bao had a spoonful of juice. Personally I find the seafood one and crab one a bit fishy so original one is my fav. Wo tip was also juicy. Rice cake was quite flavorful. 
Rice cake was 6.99 but it's not a huge portion.
Overall it's $13 pp which is reasonable. But maybe another story when the promotion is gone. 

For service: I don't even need to say a word to the server because they have this little piece of paper for you to order! You just write down the number of the dish! And the menu is full of pictures too. So i don't really need to interact with them lol.

Overall it was a pleasant and satisfying visit. 
Pictures to follow."}
{"text":"We come here weekly. I love the noodles especially the pork ramen. The soup dumplings are pretty good too! Don't expect great service here though."}
{"text":"Not the best!!!  Xiao Long Bao just OK, they offering Xiao Long Bao with paper thin dough but it's actually coming like normal as you can buy frozen and make at home. The best XIao Long Bao in Toronto I.M.O it's Din Tai Fung in Scarborough. Commander Dr. Shanghai Dim Sum place is very small inside, table for two is not big enough to hold good order. All another items from menu well prepared but not something unusual or super tasty but you have to pay little more compare to some even better places. I came to this place couple of times, after first was exited, after second was not sure why I liked it first time :) and after third time I decided I know better places :). Nothing wrong with this place, just OK."}
{"text":"This place has amazing soup filled dumplings! The \"traditional\" type as they say on the menu, the \"silk\" type actually don't have the thinner skin, but are very tasty. 
The service here is ok. It has improved over the three times I've been here. It's reached standard chinese restaurant service now. 
The time it takes the food to arrive, and i'm not just referring to the dumplings, is longer then expected. It is not as quick as the other restaurants. The other items such as onion pancake and pork belly are good, but their traditional dumplings are a must! The soup isn't oily like other places, it's tasty and the dumpling skin is thinner then at other places. 
When this place has a lineup at the door, you can expect to be waiting for awhile due to the hold up in the kitchen, so I would not recommend waiting in line if there is one."}
{"text":"Really good spot for dimsum. Ordered the $0.99 xiao long bao of course, and it was really good: pork was well seasoned and the soup was delicious. The pan fried dumplings were nice and juicy, though much bigger than what we're used to. They have your typical Shanghai foods for dimsum and lunch, and plenty of soups which are perfect for winter! Their crispy duck seemed pretty popular though I didn't try it when I was there. This place gets packed on weekend mornings so try to get there early!"}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying this is not my first time here. In fact, it's my 3rd time here. Their menu system is confusing to put into words but essentially it involves one regular menu in the black folder (good for when you go as a group), and they also have separate smaller menus (good for going alone or with a friend). The smaller menus are also significantly cheaper. However, there are definitely not as many options and it's mostly simple well-known dishes that everybody knows. 

I am only going to base this review off of what I had there today. I ordered the sweet and sour pork with rice for my main and then I also got fried dumplings (they were huge!). The rice dish was alright, it was average. The pork unfortunately was not as tender as I would've liked. But the veggies and pineapple and the red neon sauce (sweet and sour sauce) that gets mixed in with everything was fine. To be honest, I've never had an jaw-dropping sweet and sour pork dish before. I'm not sure how someone can go about making that dish amazing. You can definitely start off by choosing good cuts of meat, cooking it well, and making sure the protein is tender (also good veggies as well!). 

The item on the menu that I order from almost any Chinese restaurant I go to is their fried dumplings or \"guo tier\" for those who know what I'm talking about. Essentially it's just an enlarged version of a dumpling that's pan fried. This place has very good guo tier consistently! Their stuffing first of all is very well seasoned, well balanced between veggies and meat, and the wrapping is done very well and it's cooked very well as well. Some places either have very good wrapping and poor stuffing or very good stuffing and poor wrapping. But this place has it all! That guo tier alone made this review get an extra star. 

The waiting staff here is very friendly, decor is nice, location is nice. I eat out alone most of the time because I personally just like that. But this place is more than welcome to groups, individuals, parties, etc. 

Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I know this place is called Shanghai dim sum, but don't comes here for that. There are plenty of other places for good dim sum, so ignore the dim sum part of the name.  I would come here for the noodles which are really well made, thin but perfectly chewy. The right consistency in noodles is hard to find, and this place does it right. It can be accompanied by a wide selection of broths and meats, so there is plenty of choice. I got the lamb noodles, the meat was a little tough but the broth was flavourful enough that I didn't mind it. 

The xiao long baos are only a couple dollars for 4. Comes steaming hot, with plenty of meat and soup in it.  Not the best one's I've had, but for a couple dollars I will happily take it. Side dishes are good also, my favorite so far is the bamboo shoots. 

This place gets busy so expect to wait for a table at peak hours.  I came on a Saturday for lunch, had to wait 20 minutes for a table of 2. And there were plenty of people waiting after us also."}
{"text":"Went for late lunch yesterday(3pm) dan it wasn't busy. We saw the XLB promotion and decide to order it and quite impressed with the XLB. We love those dumpling but the selection wasn't great like i was expected. There was only 10 type of dimsum but that is fine coz we decided to order fried rice ( reading the review to avoid noodle) and turns out the fried rice was good too. So no complain about it. And i do feel like very welcomed on this place even when we don't speak mandarin. The service was good."}
{"text":"I am a regular customer at the one in Scarborough.  Great food and friendly service 'THERE\".   Expecting the same quality of food and service when I came to this new location for lunch today.  But I have experienced the worst service ever.......... I have been asked by the waitress, \"You don't speak Mandarin???  Why don't you speak Mandarin?\" at the time I placed my order.  She kept repeating the questions in that insulting tone.  Did I go into a portal and went to a place that only speaks Mandarin that I didn't even notice?  Ruined my mood in eating, but still I ordered two of my fave dishes; pan fried pork buns and noodles with green onion oil sauce.  The pork in the buns was dry and blend.  Noodles were soggy, mushy and sticking together.  There wasn't much green onion and it was tasteless.  The food in Scarborough is so much better.  The pan fried pork buns there are juicy and tender.  Noodles there are great and there isn't a time that I have a bowl of soggy noodles.  Very disappointed about this new location, and this is my first and last time!!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since we have been here and totally forgot how good the food is. We ordered take out and the food was on time for our pick up at 6:30pm. I used their website and all the prices were correct and they didn't miss any of our big order. When we went to pick up the food, the restaurant was already busy. We ordered the XLB, pan fried dumpling, sticky rice roll,  Shanghai fried noodles, fried rice with preserved meat and vegetables, green beans, stir fried tofu and pork, and boiled chicken in chili sauce. Everything was cooked well, tasty, and full of flavours. We are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This place offers loads of $1 morning specials between 9am to 11am, which includes their famous Xiao Long Bao buns. It is definitely worth it to wake up early for the specials because where else are you going to find such good deals, I mean even McD burgers are over $1 each. 

Environment:
It's located near Hwy7/Bayview where parking spaces are ample, especially if you're coming around early to take advantage of the early bird $1 specials. 
The restaurant was decent sized, but the smaller 2-4 person tables were usually the first to be filled, and it didn't seem they would group 2 or more smaller groups into 1 big tables. 

Food:
We ordered a bunch of stuff from their dollar menu, which include soya bean milk, all 3 kinds of Xiao Long Baos (it becomes $2.50 for 4 buns if you want to add more), deep fried pancakes, deep fried dough, and deep fried pastries. We also ordered some items from their regular priced menu such as the Salty Chicken, Sweet and Sour Ribs, and the Shanghai Noodles. 
The dollar menu items all tasted really good, especially the Xiao Long Baos, which the skin was really thin and each of the buns were very juicy on the inside, including the pan fried ones. The soya bean milk was also great as well, you get a lot per order, and those tasted like they were made fresh in house.
The regularly priced items weren't as good in terms of value. The chicken had good flavour but the portion was quite small. The ribs had good tasting sauce, but the meat was very dry and chewy which I didn't really like. The Shanghai Noodle was just...sad, it barely contained any meat and at $8.99 it's super over priced for just some noodles with soya sauce. 

Service:
Super slow service that it felt understaffed. We've had a hard time waving down servers and sometimes it even felt like they were intentionally avoiding our signal. However, the food came pretty fast though.

Overall, come early and take advantage of the $1 dim sum special, don't bother with the regular priced stuff unless you're feeling adventurous, and have patience with the slow service."}
{"text":"Surprising good food from a small restaurant! The restaurant isn't exactly pretty but the food was delicious! Lots of choices, service was quick enough but the waiters aren't really fluent in English so you should have a Chinese speaking friend with you if you go. Food is worth a try!"}
{"text":"For most people and myself included, when we think of Shanghai cuisine we think \"Xiaolongbao\" which is small soup fill dumplings. What brought me to this restaurant was that I heard they charge $1-2 for an order of Xiaolongbao!! So I came for cheap Xiaolongbao but i discovered that only the first order is at the special price and any order after that is at regular price. That is ok because they have few versions of the Xiaolongbao and each version you can order it once at special price. That's enough Xiaolongbao for me!

I've also tried other dishes of course. Most things are pretty decent, especially the cumin fried chicken and the ramen noodles. Service is typical Chinese restaurant, don't expect much. Restaurant setting and decor is also typical, don't get too cozy.

I must confess that I am no fan of Shanghainese food. They are usually pretty expensive and I don't think it's worth it for what it is. Maybe I have not experience true shanghai cuisine, but for what I experienced so far I found them lacking in flavour variations. Simply put, it mostly taste the same.

{"text":"I'm surprised this place gets so many good reviews. We ordered Savory Soy Milk,  Steamed Bun, Pan fried Pork Buns, Suimai, and Cold Fish dish. Other than Soy Milk and Steamed Buns (over cooked,  wrappers are broken), everything else was below mediocre. Pan Fried Pork is a thick bao, all flour. Suimai is taseless, Cold Fish dish should be renamed to fish jerky with over powered clove \"jelly\". We complained to the kitchen,  the staff pretty said \"that's how we cook here,  like it or leave it\".. Will never go back. Btw, I was born and raised in Shanghai, this is way too far from authentic Shanghainese food."}
{"text":"Good food
Cheap as it will get for this type of food
Fast service and clean setup

Tried their soup dumplings. The ones they have here are grilled on the bottom so a bit different from othere places. The portions of the dishes are extremely generous. The one dish that stood out was the braised beef noodle in soup. The noodles were a bit different here aswell. They were a bit thiner but still with a good chew. The braised beef was soft and tender.

Tried a few other dishes and they were all excellent."}
{"text":"First time here, only one word to give review \"brilliant\". Highly recommended breakfast. Taiwanese and Shanghainese mix breakfast. Deserved 5 stars!"}
{"text":"My favourite place for xiao long bao (dumplings)!  They have a pretty good promotion, where the first bamboo steamer ranges from $1.99 to $3.99, and the second steamer would range from $2.99-$5.99.  

We were a group of four who went after 1 pm on a weekday, and were immediately seated.  After about 10 minutes, there was a long wait. The menu is great for me, because it has a photograph of each plate. We ordered one of each of the steamed dumplings, savory stick rice roll, the Chinese beef burger, the stir-fried rice cake with pork and veggie, pork jelly cake, fried egg white with broccoli, and shredded chicken in peanut sauce.  For a group of four this is way too much food, but a great variety.  I found the rice roll really bland and tasteless. The only thing I could taste was the shredded salted pork (the stuff you sometimes put on your congee).  As for the xiao long bao, it tasted great and soupy inside.  Service was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"as a shanghainese, just dined with family late Mon p.m. generally good quality and big portion at reasonable price.  if less or no m.s.g. we will give it a five.  Although not exactly authentically shanghai style @100%, such as bigger in size for the shanghai soup dumpling(xiao long bao) and pan fried pork bun (shen jian bao). services so so, since we never got napkins, plates for everyone, & had to help ourselves:)"}
{"text":"My fiancÃ© and I actually come here once every month or two either for lunch or dinner on weekends; we've also brought friends here too.

For my dad's birthday, I decided to bring him here with the whole family and was extra pleased with the service so I felt compelled to write a review!

FAVOURITE DISHES
Whenever we come here, we ALWAYS order the \"Steamed Soup Dumplings w/ Pork\" (#B-2) and the \"Hamburger w/ Beef & Caraway\" (#B-10).  They are simply delicious!

Each order of the B-2 come with 6 soup dumplings; they come out fresh and steaming hot but all you need to do is let it sit in the bath of vinegar for a couple of minutes and it'll start cooling down.  Please don't eat it any other way!  As Eddie Huang says, \"Don't be a f___ing hooligan!\" ;P

The hamburgers are also amazing!  The sesame toasted buns come out crispy and warm.  The meat is flavourful but I still like a few drops of vinegar on it.

We've tried other dishes too, which never disappointed.  The best part is that there's very little (if any at all) MSG.  I simply hate the after-taste of MSG-laden Chinese food!  You feel extra thirsty but NONE of this at Shanghai Dim Sum!  My whole family was very satisfied tonight.  We agreed that we'd never go to Asian Legend again for Shanghai food!

SERVICE
The servers are always friendly and courteous.  For tonight's meal, we ended up getting one of the larger tables.  However, near the end of our meal, the manager/owner apologetically asked us if we could move over to a smaller table for another group coming in.  We actually didn't mind especially since he gave 10% off and service was especially attentive (i.e. tea refills were prompt, we kept getting clean dishes and extra napkins)

Shortly after they brought our cake to the table, they ended up playing The Birthday song and everyone in the restaurant clapped!  :)  That was really thoughtful of them.

DOWNSIDE (very minor)
Most of them only speak Mandarin so communication was an issue sometimes.  The tea isn't the best; they use tea bags.  I'm a little picky with tea and would've preferred tea leaves.

Also the restaurant is very small.  Luckily line-ups were never an issue.  We've always been seated within 10 minutes.

VERDICT
Love this place!"}
{"text":"Heard some good things about their Scarborough location so I decided to check this location out.

Pros:
Lots of items to choose from
Many Entrees for just $5.99

Cons:
Not much actual dim sum items

Came here on a Friday night and the place was pretty busy.  Luckily there was one table available at the time we were there.  The menus here consist of two large laminated boards.  All the items are pictured so you know exactly what anything looks like which is good.  There's a lot of items to choose from but I do note that there's not much actual dim sum items to choose from.  I may have missed the boat on what dim sum from Shanghai actually consists of though.  I was expecting a twist on usual dim sum items or dumplings.  Neither were really on the menu.  Honestly, it's more a regular restaurant than a dim sum restaurant in my opinion.

We ordered two types of soup filled dumplings (basically the only dumplings on the menu), a ramen bowl and a pork and broccoli rice dish.  The food comes out pretty quick here which is nice.  The soup filled dumplings were OK, but nothing special. The filling was average at best.  The ramen and rice dish were pretty good.  For $5.99, it's actually a very good deal. They have many entrees at $5.99 to choose from so you can definitely come for a cheap decent meal.

I think i would of been a lot more satisfied if I came thinking this was a regular Chinese restaurant and not what I was expecting it to be.  When you have dim sum in your name I'm thinking actual dim sum and dumplings at the very least.  It's still a nice place to come for a meal. just wish the menu would reflect their name a little better."}
{"text":"This is tiny! There's only about 10 tables inside. Parking can also be a problem since there's not a lot of parking spots in this little joint. 

Food selection is smaller than most Shanghai places but I prefer a small menu over a large menu anyways. What's the point of having 300 items on the menu and less than 10% of it actually tastes good? 

The food here is flavorful and comes out relatively fast. I especially like their Xiao Long Bao and noodles. 

I usually like to visit this place at odd hours so I can avoid the parking problem."}
{"text":"Kids were hungry on the way home from the mall and dumplings are always a option when your kids are hungry:)   This location of Shanghai Dim Sum on Hwy 7 is the second branch with the original one being in Scarborough.  Not really \"dim sum\" per say but Northern Chinese fare with the specialty being their Shanghai soup dumplings aka Xiao Long Bao.

Have to say their dumplings are excellent!  The two types of soup dumplings are the thinner one aka \"silk skin\" and the traditional ones.  Both are really good and you can't go wrong with either one.  Be warned though, let it cool for a minute or two as they will explode in your mouth and burn the living crap of out of your lips and tongue!

We were really impressed with the food overall as everything was done well from the Shanghai noodles, pan fried dumplings, etc.  All the food in the menu came with pictures so made it easy to decided what dishes you wanted to try.  

Food came out extremely fast despite the restaurant being packed.  Most of the servers only spoke Mandarin but they all seemed to understand Cantonese.  They were very good at bringing anything required such as water, napkins etc.. so that's a huge plus.

Really look forward to trying out the other dishes they have on the menu as some of the stuff looked really good going to the other tables.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Would recommend this place for casual dining.  

This place was recommended to me by a wealthy friend who is from Shanghai and he said the food there is very authentic, lives in the area and goes all the time.

Came here for dinner, we didn't have RSVP so we had to wait upwards of 30 minutes for a table of 3.

We didn't go with their set combo but saw that most of the tables did.

Instead we order soup noodles and dumplings.  The dumplings were good, the wrapper for the dumplings was thin and the inside was tasty.  They have 4 different types of soup filled steamed dumplings on the menu.  The first order is $2 to $3 for a set of 5 dumplings depending which one you choose from.  The re-order is regular price at $5 to $6 which is average price.  So tried all 4 different sets and it only costed $12! Amazing deal!!

The soup noodles was good too, the soup base had flavour and didn't have a lot of MSG and was $6.99 a bowl.

Dinner for 3 was less then $50 for dine-in including tip!!

4 stars because the food was good and the price was cheap."}
{"text":"Definitely recommended for casual dining and authentic Shanghai cuisine. Shanghai Dim Sum on Chalmers Court offers $0.99 for pork xiao long baos. We ordered

-Steamed Silk Skin (Crab+Pork), 
-Steamed Soup Filled Dumplings (Pork),
-Steamed Shu-mai w/ Shrimp & Pork
-Deep Fried Egg White Balls Stuffed w/ Red Bean
-Beef Brisket Noodle in Soup
amongst a few other things

It is a reasonable place to go for xiao long bao & not just based on price but on quality. Shanghai Dim Sum also offers ramen, stir fried dishes and a lot of variety amongst their dishes."}
{"text":"Siu long bao here is indeed well made and great for the price ($1/dish with 4pcs for the first one,  $2.99 for each one after). Food is consistently delicious. The waiters offer a quick family-style friendly, and easy to flag down when you need them. Most dishes i tried are above average and well worth the price!"}
{"text":"They seem to be doing well based on the amount of people that were there. But their dim sum was different from other dim sum places. If you are expecting Cantonese style dim sum to be similar to Shanghai be warned, its NOT. I found out. Will not be going to any Shanghai style dim sum places again. Service was just average."}
{"text":"It was hard to find a place with really good shanghainese dim sum. But this place was it!! When my precious go-to place for soup dumplings closed, I tried several different places and this one was the best :).

The only problem is that the prices are prettyyyyyy high here and the service is sometimes shaky. I remember having a few problems with the attitudes the waitresses before but the owner is always really kind and looks out for the customers. Maybe the waitresses were overwhelmed because I usually notice only like 2-3 running around. 

Anyway everything here is pretty great just the prices are a little higher than id like. But it's so worth it when I'm craving the dishes that they make so well."}
{"text":"I agree that this place is a 3.5 star restaurant, but I'm leaning more towards a 4. This is a pretty tight restaurant and has a lot of specials. They have 4 different types of xlb and are discounted to $0.99 to $1.99 for your first pre-set serving. If you want another serving, you'll be paying around $2.99 to $3.99. It's a smart way to market to gain greater traction as they are located close to Asian Legend and other known Chinese restaurants. Food quality is average with a notable \"fried\" xlb that I highly recommend. It's also the one priced at $0.99 for the first serving. It was super tasty with good portion of soup in the dumpling. I would stray away from their shanghai noodle dish and hot and spicy soup. The noodle dish was burnt and the soup tasted like it was from t&t. But the shrimp dish we ordered was fairly good. It could be compared to the one dish I've had in Shanghai. The best part about this dish is that they were having a promotion for it. Buy one get a voucher for the same dish for free at your next visit (within 3 weeks). 

Overall I had a pleasant experience and was really trying to stop myself from ordering another fried xlb. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Better than the one on Sheppard!! I wish I discovered this place earlier. Affordable, fast, and delicious food. Like the other location, you can get four different dumpling specials for your first order. The second orders are gonna be at regular price. We ordered very similar dishes as last time: hot and sour soup, fried xlbs, and steamed xlb. All were on point and definitely a must try. Seriously, no complaints this time around and am already looking forward to my next visit. 

They often have buy one get one free specials. The catch is that the second dish has to be ordered at your next visit within 3 weeks of your date of purchase and you must spend at least $10 at the voucher redeeming visit."}
{"text":"I am honestly reviewing their 3 foods only 
- xiao long bao
- Sheng Jian Bao (pan fried xiao long bao)
- fish and vegetable soup

I go to this place every other weekend and no matter how much I tell myself to try their new foods, I end up ordering the same food. 

I am drooling as I am typing this. Plus psst... the first order on their xiao long bao and Sheng Jian bao are 99 cents and 1.99 resp. only. Can't get better than this. Cheers !!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. Small but got really good and cheap Shanghai dumplings ! First order is $1 and every order after that is a bit more. Good deal! 

Also their pork ramen is delicious $8.99! Except I could do without the bamboo. 

Quick service and food is served fast."}
{"text":"90% of why my rating is low is because of the service at this restaurant. The servers cannot speak any language other than mandarin.  If you can't understand chinese, this will be a tough place to get a server to even speak with you.

We sat at our table, and they give you your own piece of paper to write your order on, not a big fan of that, especially at a full serve Asian restaurant.
We placed our order and handed it to the server along with the menus.  15 minutes later, not even a drink had arrived, struggling to even communicate with the waitress (who looks miserable at what she does), says that they never received our order. 

It took us asking 3 servers to get an extra setting St the table because there were 3 of us and only 2 settings were placed on the table.

So we replaced the order and food came within 10 minutes. Food quality was average, nothing special as any other Shanghai dim sum restaurant. We paid about $41 taxes in for 5 plates as shown in my photos.

They really need to up their quality of service and get some servers that know how to speak at LEAST English.  Definately wouldn't be coming back..."}
{"text":"Shanghai Dim Sum is my go-to place for XLB; their XLB is fresh with thin wrapper and juicy. The best is the special price for their 3 different kinds of XLB although I cannot really taste the differences. The original XLB is still my favourite.

Other than XLB, I love the Fried Rice with Salted meat and Veggie; this is the close to the fried rice with veggie in my childhood. If it can be served with Shanghainese style pork cutlet would be perfect.

This location of Shanghai Dim Sum used a little more MSG and salty compares to the Scarborough location."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with some friends and I would not recommend this place for weekends. We  didn't even get to try the food because the service was so horrific. We made reservations over the phone and I guess they didn't record it properly. Mistakes happen so we didn't mind waiting it out. It was super crowded so they had everyone pick numbers and then yelled the numbers out when tables became available. (Which who wants to hear people yelling numbers while they are enjoying a night out?) They were so disorganized and were calling numbers out of order. People that came after us were seated before us. It was a mess so we left. Perhaps we would have had a different experience if we came on a more low key night."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from my coworker, who mentioned the $0.99 xiaolongbao! Apparently it's usually very busy, but we managed to arrive for lunch on Friday and got seated immediately! The decor is minimal and seating is a bit cramped. The service wasn't that great, with relatively unfriendly staff, though that's expected at most Chinese restaurants of a similar calibre.

The food itself was pretty good, especially the xiaolongbao! We ordered the \"silk skin\" pork XLB and pork and crab XLB, both of which had a thin wrap with lots of tender meat and soup on the inside. It's a better deal than the ones at Ding Tai Fung. The mapo tofu was also decent. However, the pan-fried dumplings were far too oily. When I was eating them, I could feel the oil sticking to the inside of my mouth, and when we poured the \"soup\" of the inside into a bowl, most of it was oil. Gross. All in all, this is a great place for a quick fix of xiaolongbao! I'd rate it as follows:

Atmosphere: 3/5
Service: 2.5/5
Food: 4/5"}
{"text":"Their XLB are great. Cheap and yummy. The skin doesnt rip with the soup spilling out like how some places are. First order of them are $1 with 4 of them per plate. But food overall comes out of the kitchen slow. They also make their dan dan noodles more soupy/watery than how I usually get them. 

Service or self service LOL - they don't put out the plates for you and you need to write down your own order. They have so many people on floor but half of them are just standing there lol. They have also gotten our orders wrong once and the table beside us twice.

Place is very small and pretty loud. Line ups are to the door cause this place could probably fit 50 max? Parking is already a pain. Hmm not quite my type of environment."}
{"text":"Very decent Shanghai food and not expensive, compared to the fake DTF in Markham. There's really long line ups here because the food portions are big and taste is not bad.  We got the thin skin ones that are 0.99 for the first order for the pork XLBs and slightly more expensive for the crab and pork ones. 

Solid Shanghainese food for the price."}
{"text":"Today was the second time I've tried them. I thought I would give them a couple of shots to show me since last time I went it was super busy.

So, going in I ordered some pan-fried pork dumplings and stir fried beef with green onion to go. Took about 15-20 minutes to finish, and paid about $20 for both. 

Took it back to my office and opened it up. It looked good and smelled good. The pan-fried dumplings tasted great! only negative, they weren't really crispy and it was what I was expecting based on the picture in their menu. The stir fried beef was good, but I completely forgot to get rice.

For the price and food, I wasn't amazingly impressed, but it satisfied by hunger. Thus would say they are \"A-OK\", and something to get if you need quick satisfaction."}
{"text":"Food was just Ok, some of the dishes do not taste authentic and they use too much soy sauce."}
{"text":"This place has been around for a long time. While I really liked the quality of the food from years ago, they are not the same. It was packed when we went (~7:30 on a Friday evening) and had to share a table. Service was incredibly slow as other groups who say 20 min after we did got all of their food before we did. For example, both our groups ordered xiaolong bao, but theirs arrived 15 min before we finally got ours; 35 min swing... The soup inside the dumpings were also very oily, even some black vinegar wasn't enough to cut the oily taste. We also ordered the pork burger, which was dry and not filled with a lot of meat. We had stir fry Shanghai noodles, which tasted okay but a pool of oil and grease was at the bottom of the plate. We had the sweet and sour ribs, which arrived cold. 

Last we had the dumplings in fermented glutinous rice wine. This was the best illustration of how the quality of the restaurant has slipped. Whereas I was able to taste the bitterness of the alcohol last time I tried it, it was nonexistent this time. Basically it was a rice flavored sweet soup with the glutinous dumplings. The unmelted granular sugar seen at the bottom of the bowl also indicated a lesser type of sugar being used than before (rock sugar). All in all, it was a disappointing experience, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"What I ordered: 10-person set course ($328)

Pros:
- This is one of the more worth it places I've been to for steamed buns, with a set of 6 steamed buns for $1. 
- Although this restaurants calls itself a dim sum restaurant, they don't serve the traditional Cantonese dim sum that people are used to. Here you can get a Shanghainese breakfast. 
- For dinner, I've only been here for set course round table dinner. The portions are huge and the chefs do plating and food carving really well, each dish looks very beautiful. 
- Other than steamed buns, this restaurant also does soups and classic ginger and onion beef really well. I also like this raw egg mixed with crabmeat dish that I've gotten each time I've been here (make sure you add a splash of vinegar after you mix the egg). 
- Although there aren't private rooms you can reserve, there are 2 large round tables near the back that are separated from some bamboo decorations. Personally, I haven't found noise to be a problem. 

Cons:
- Parking right outside the restaurant can be kind of annoying especially since it's right near the entrance to the parking lot. 
- I wouldn't recommend the soup noodles as much as the meat and dim sum items. This is not a restaurant known for their soup noodles."}
{"text":"We ordered a savoury sticky rice roll, stir fried sticky rice cakes, beef brisket noodle in soup, pan fried XLB (only $3.99 for first order), pan fried dumplings, steamed soup filled dumplings, and steamed silk skinned XLB (crab & pork only $3.99 for first order).

The savoury sticky rice roll, stir fried sticky rice cakes, beef brisket noodle in soup, and pan fried dumplings were pretty standard.  They tasted like how they would taste at any other Shanghainese restaurant.  I have to say that the stir fried sticky rice cakes had good 'wok hay' though.

What stood out to me here were the XLB (xiao long bao, or steamed soup dumplings).  The skin of the steamed dumplings were the thinnest from any Shanghainese restaurant in the GTA.  Mind you, I haven't been to all of the Shanghainese restaurants in the GTA either.  So some of you may say, that there's thinner skinned dumplings out there.  I wasn't able to really tell the difference in the filling from the normal pork one with the crab and pork.  So next time I go, I would just get the normal pork ones (they were the ones with the thinnest skin anyways).  The pan fried XLB was interesting, I've never had those before.  They were like a cross between the pan fried dumpling and the steamed soup dumpling.  The filling wasn't as juicy/soupy as the normal steamed soup dumplings."}
{"text":"Dropped by Shanghai Dim Sum for lunch on a late weekday afternoon. This place is packed! We have to wait for a table.. This restaurant is busy because it is relatively small....

They do have a lot of table for 2.. yes small tables in good location in the restaurant so it would be a good place if you eating alone. At least you will not be stuck at the back or near the washroom!

The prices they charge here is relatively high in line with Asian Legends when compare to area restaurants remember it is Scarborough! 

There are a lot of dim sum items we want to try but we decided on:

 - Pan Fried Pork Buns ($4.99)
They are quite good, freshly made with meat juice inside
- Special Roy Dumplings ($4.99)
Though only have 3 dumplings per order, they are so good and delicious. You have to try to suck up all the juice before taking a bite, if not they will explode everywhere!
- Chunk Beef Noodles Soup ($6.99)
It is ok. The noodles though lack the chew to it. The beef is nice and tender though, if they have put in a few veggies, it will be perfect!
- Hot & Sour Soup S ($3.99) requested extra spicy
Based on previous yelper's  recommendation, we ordered it extra spicy. The ingredients are quite interesting with pig skin? First time I have pig skin in hot and sour soup
- Pan Fried Green Onion Pancake ($3.99)
A little pricey... not as crispy as Asian Legends though the taste of green onion is more intense! 
- Speicial Old Shanghai Mango Bun ($4.99)
My coworkers really enjoyed that as both was commenting on how good texture wise the buns are, and the filling has just a little hint of sweetness and great mango taste. 

Since there is no lunch specials.. This lunch turned out more than my usual lunch. 

Will I be back?? Yes probably to eat that Special Royal Dumplings... but with the price I am paying there are so many other choices of great lunch spot. And if I have to wait for a table? That is really out of the question!

They accepts Visa and Debit only, but I know they prefer Cash.."}
{"text":"Second location of Shanghai Dim Sum in Scarborough.

This new location is way more spacious than it's older sister and offers similar menu.

Noodles with Soup and Peanut Paste ($5.99) and Royal  Dumplings ($5.99) were good but not too memorable.  The presentation of my dumplings looked sad and they were a little too big and overcooked that's why they all looked deflated!

Service was fast but maybe too fast. The waitress was picking up my tea cup trying to wipe my table while I still sipping my tea....

No lunch special and Cash only!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Shanghai restaurants that restaurants in Richmond Hill. Its dishes are of excellent taste and authenticity, they come in large proportions and the prices are cheap to fair, never expensive. I definitely recommend anyone who want to taste some delicious Shanghai food to come here and stuff yourself!!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my regular go-to's and I'm so surprised I've never written a review on it yet.

They are most known for their $0.99 soup dumplings. They have an assortment of different types that are for $0.99 or $1.99 for the first order. They have recently added a requirement that a main dish be ordered first, so that people don't come in here just to order the soup dumplings.

Makes a really cheap and delicious meal when you're in the area. You can easily order a filling meal for two people for less than $20 after tax and tip. Note that because it's only cheap for the first order of soup dumplings, it won't be that cheap to come here with a huge group. I recommend this place for couples or groups of two."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant! My friends and I went at 11am and beat the rush.. people were lined up trying to eat here. The first batch of xiao long bao was only $1; needless to say - we ordered 4.. and ate them all!"}
{"text":"As a native from Shanghai, this restaurant really hits home when it comes to providing authentic Shanghai dishes. If you are craving some soup dumpling, deep fried rice patties, or just some deep fried dough with congee, this place is a must-try. They have all-around side dishes and Dim Sum.

We ordered the soup dumplings, pan fried pork buns, beef noodles, congee and deep fried dough, sweet sauteed pork, and wontons. This place is probably one of the ONLY places that gets the thickness of the soup dumplings right. (Yeah I know, sounds too good to be true right). The soup dumplings were super juicy too!

But as much as I'm hyping their soup dumplings, in a place like Markham, good soup dumplings aren't actually too hard to find. What REALLY makes Shanghai Dim Sum stand out is their deep fried rice patties (which are like a super nostalgic part of my parents' childhood so it has to be important, right?). Not a lot of places actually serve this snack, and when they do, it's usually pretty bad. So huge shoutout to Shanghai Dim Sum for that.

Everything else is pretty standard. No complaints about the service, but nothing too outstanding. Decor of restaurant is clean, but nothing memorable or special. Menus have some pictures and are not handwritten?! (nice!!).

Thanks Shanghai Dim Sum!"}
{"text":"I came here for late lunch for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. The food was amazing. They have specials for 3 of their xiao long baos: pork ($0.99 for 4), pork and crab ($1.99 for 4), and pan fried pork ($1.99 for 4). They looked perfect, each with 18 folds. They also tasted great. I liked the pan fried pork xiao long baos the most. It had a nice crunchiness at the bottom that I enjoyed.

We also had the beef brisket with noodles in soup. The beef was soft and tasty, the noodles were cooked perfectly, and the soup was excellent. We also tried the Shanghai-style stewed pork thigh. It looked impressive and tasted amazing. The meat fell off the bone without effort. It was slow-cooked to perfection. The pork thigh is also a special where you get a coupon for a free pork thigh on your next visit (expires in 3 weeks).

Our group had to wait a while to get a table, but service was good."}
{"text":"Regular soup filled dumplings 6/$5.99 is about the same price as Ding Tai Fung, bigger in size but not as good.  The skin was not thin and got hard fast. The silk skin soup filled dumpling tasted the same as the regular but was a lot cheaper. 4/$0.99 for your first order. $1.99 after that. Pork ramen was pretty good but still not as good as authentic Japanese ramen. Chili fried shrimp was spicy and tasty. The rice cake dish was good, had a nice chew but not too chewy. The green onion pancake was just ok."}
{"text":"Located on a corner lot surrounded by an L-shaped parking lot the building was a small box that looked liked a converted donut or fast food place. Inside there were a few round tables and a couple of square ones all packed together really tightly. The place was packed and we waited for a table. The menu featured a selection of Shanghai inspired dim sum, which is heavy on the pork, lacking a lot of familiar shrimp & seafood options. The feature of Shanghai dim sum are soup dumplings and steamed buns filled with assorted fillings. If you love Shanghai styled dim sum this is the place. The service was quick and the food delicious."}
{"text":"Came here around 5pm, ordered the shredded chicken and veggie noodle soup. 

When the dish came we noticed a bug in the soup so we asked for it to be remade. After the 2nd one came, we started to eat. As delicious it may be, at the end of the meal, we noticed another bug floating in the soup again.. 

So two bugs, two noodle soups.. Atleast they gave us free mochi lmfao."}
{"text":"The only thing they have going for them is the pork soup dumplings and the price of them! 99 cents for your first basket and then $2.99 after that! We ordered a few other dishes as well, including sticky rice with fried dough inside, steamed chicken, jellied ham, and chive pancake. None of them really stuck out as particularly delicious though."}
{"text":"The food is ok and came out quite fast. There were 2 servers for 2 tables  and we still have to call them to refill teas. Item B16 was good, also the mini xiao loong bao is good. The pan fried buns was huge."}
{"text":"I'm all for $0.99 Silk-skin XLB!! It comes in 4 pcs per order. Keep in mind that $0.99 only for the first order and your second order will be $2.99 which is still sooooo cheap!

We also ordered their regular XLB which has a thicker skin, it was just okay. I'm not a fan of the thicker skin. If you're looking for the true XLB, order the silk skin one which is also cheaper. Doesn't really makes sense to me why the thicker skin is more expensive.

We also ordered the jelly fish which was fresh and great, a little salty, and the braised pork with preserved vegetable which was savoury but also quite bland, I wish it was a little sweeter. We had some leftover of the pork, it tasted really good the day after, much more flavourful.

Overall, definitely will come back for the Silk Skin XLB! And maybe some noodles and steamed fish :)"}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant a couple of times on different visits for their morning specials. XLB 1st order is 99 cents for 4. Additional order 2.49. They are small but .. are filled with soup inside and not one broke open when transferring to spoon or bowl :) even though the skin is pretty thin & translucent- can see the soup inside. That's a good thing! The meat inside is ok. (Still the best is in Flushing, NY food court) They have a pan fried bottom one which is something different and is good.  We also got San jeen bao's - that was super fluffy and juicy. This time we tried their won ton in chili oil sauce. Not too spicy. Again the won ton's are small. It's the taste that matters right? 
Service: average typical Chinese restaurant service. Only one waitress and she speaks Mandarin. Other patrons around us spoke Cantonese which is typical in the area."}
{"text":"Did someone say cheap Siu Long Bao??? This place by far has the cheapest price on Siu Long Bao the first order is only $1.99 compared to other places at $6-7.99 per order. You may think because of the cheap price it maybe your run of the mill Siu Long Bao you get at some cheap dim sum restaurant that is typically made from frozen but I can tell you it is definitely not. The texture of the skin is very thin and soft and even has soup inside! The place is more of fusion between Shanghai food and a Noodle Bar. They have a wide variety of noodles and ramen the menu is small and filled with lots of pictures so you know what you are ordering. Be prepared for a wait because this place gets pretty rammed during the lunch and dinner times . Their portions are generous and when the bill comes you wont hardly believe your eyes. 

Some personal favorites include: Siu Long Bao, Fried Rice with Preserved Meat & Vegetable, and their Beef Brisket Noodle in Soup. 

It's good food and its cheap; what else can you ask for?"}
