{"text":"Yes it's another fried chicken place, but a pretty good one.  

Beer are actually served with cold glasses, which is good. The golden cheese is interesting but the chicken is a bit dry. I enjoyed the original spicy (wet) better. Also tried the soy garlic but that was disappointing. The Fry is still better though imho."}
{"text":"Right now its my favourite KFC joint in Toronto. We ordered fire hot chicken which was juicy, tender and crispy. For those that can't take much spice... Stick with something else! We also got the green onion chicken which was just as delicious. Portions are fairly big. It was enough for 6 of us. Mind you we were snacking on the complimentary popcorn before hand. Service was friendly, quick and attentive. Place was clean EXCEPT the men's washroom... The ceiling was leaking and water was dripping everywhere."}
{"text":"One of the best Korean fried chicken store in Toronto! The taste is really close to what I had in Seoul. You will definitely love it if you are a fan of Korean street food due to the authentic taste."}
{"text":"First time checking this place out. Ordered the half and half chicken. Original and seasoned spicy. The seasoned spicy was some of the best chicken I've ever had! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Didn't live up to the hype :( 

We ordered the half/half cheese and spicy chicken and the jjol chicken. Other than the wings and drumsticks, everything was REALLY, REALLY dry (like R E A L L Y dry). We also got fries and oden, they were okay. 

Probably not going to come again, dakgogi is much better."}
{"text":"Pro: really juicy and flavorful chicken fried to perfection
Con: unpredictable wait time

My friends and I decided to give this place a try after craving for real authentic Korean fried chicken for a while. Knowing this place was a chain from Korea, we had pretty high expectations. We ordered the yangnyeom chicken and honey butter garlic boneless chicken (the waitress recommended we get boneless and it was so worth the extra 2 bucks). 

The yangnyeom was my personal favorite due to the savory and spicy kick of the tangy sauce. However, I have to say that it did taste a little Chinese as they added 5 spice powder. My Korean friend said that it didn't have that authentic taste she was looking for. Nevertheless, it was truly delicious and paired perfectly with the drinks we ordered.

The honey butter chicken came with rice cakes and sweet potato which was a pleasant surprise. The chicken was extremely garlic-y so I wouldn't recommend if you don't want to smell like garlic afterwards. All of us actually quite enjoyed the mix of the sticky sweet honey and fragrant garlic. The waitress was right, boneless fits best with this flavor. 

Do give this place a try if you have time. The food is amazing and ambiance was great. However avoid rush hours as you will wait for a long time."}
{"text":"Got take out of their half and half (golden cheese and the spicy seasoned one) would definitely go back! The golden cheese flavour with bones beats every fried chicken I've tried in Toronto!"}
{"text":"After reading the amazing reviews that this place has I was very excited to try this Korean style fried chicken place with my friends. I'm not sure if we came on a bad day but there were way too many overcooked and dried chicken pieces in our orders.  

We were given sided dishes of pickled radish, pickled dikon raddish and popcorn(???). It felt pretty weird to be served popcorn as a side dish but I didn't mind it too much. 

We ordered the cheese, honey garlic and onion. The flavours were very yummy, I especially enjoyed the onion fried chicken. It had a very nice flavour that wasn't too overpowering. The garlic and honey came with small pieces and fried rice cake and yam  which I thought added a nice touch to the dish. 

Overall, I'm pretty disappointed with the overcooked chicken and have yet to find a place that serves good korean fried chicken. The flavours made it more bearable but I probably won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a Korean chicken place that sells special flavoured crispy chicken with beer and Korean drinks. They also have a little bar inside their restaurant. We came on a night during a weekday and the tables were pretty full except two open spaces. We ordered the spicy chicken (their most popular one) and garlic soy chicken.

I've had my fair taste of the korean chicken places around the city and by far, my my chicken has the best flavoured and crispiness to them, and reminds me of the ones I ate in Korea. 

The service was also very prompt and we got our chicken pretty fast. I would recommend the spicy chicken over the garlic soy one, as the latter tasted a bit bland and less crispy. 

Overall, I would come back here, but make sure come earlier in the evening or late to get a spot as it's spreading word and getting popular amongst foodies."}
{"text":"It's a 2.9.  Maybe an off day?  Chickens were dry.

We ordered:

Half/Half Gold Cheese and Seasoned Spicy Chicken ($28): Too bad that both were dry.  Gold Cheese has a nice cheese flavour.  I liked the Spicy Chicken a bit more because the sauce offsets the dry chicken.  Honestly, it was pretty much average chicken. Rating: 3/5

Seafood Pancake ($13): Very thick dough.  The base of the pancake was too gooey/sticky.  Nothing special.  Rating: 2.5/5

They offered 3 small side dishes: salty popcorn, radish, pickled slaw?

It's just average chicken."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out the hype and found great Korean chicken here. You have to eat it fresh though and any sort of reheating (as we couldn't finish it all and had to bring it home) ruins it. Try the original. Won't regret it. :)"}
{"text":"My first time having Korean Fried Chicken and it did not disappoint! We ordered the half original half spicy chicken deal. We originally asked for two other options but the waiter let us know that each of those would have been a full chicken and A LOT of food. He was very helpful and actually saved us money when he could have just let us order that and then be overwhelmed by the amount of food. Will definitely be coming back and have recommended MyMy chicken to friends. Excited to try other amazing flavours!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't really know what the hype is about. There are only a small number of items on their menu that is good but overall can't say it's worth the wait. They don't take reservations so you should expect to wait an hour for seats on a weekend. 

Usually, at Korean Chicken joints, I judge it on the original chicken and spicy chicken as those are the staples. However, I wasn't too fond of their seasoned spicy chicken. It's not the traditional Korean spicy chicken (yang nyeom chicken) that I'm used to. There's a hint of cinnamon in it that doesn't really work for me. The cheese chicken is meh. It was barely touched at our table.

Despite the long wait and the interesting spicy chicken, the green onion chicken and steamed eggs is delicious! The green onion chicken has a nice kick of wasabi in the sauce that makes it better than other Korean chicken places I've tried. 

Overall, Mymy Chicken has great ambience, decent food (depends what you order) but it probably wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Mymy beats the other nearby Korean chicken places, as their portions and quality are quite comparable to how they serve it in Korea. I highly recommend their whole chicken (1/2 regular and 1/2 spicy). 

This was my first time eating in as I always got take-out (and was pleasantly surprised with the friendly staff, despite being a full house). If you're not a huge fan of crowded/dark/loud restaurants, take-out is the way to go :)"}
{"text":"The best Korean fried chicken in Toronto in my opinion and I have had my fair share in Korea! The cheese one is great especially if you prefer the dry kind. But portions are large and you definitely need to share it. The one downside is if you want to do half-half or mixing flavours, your choices are more limited."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high having gone to places in seoul and the us like bonchon and kyochon, but mymy doesn't compare.  The chicken was ok, but tasted more like standard western style fried chicken and not the double fried korean variety.  Also was a big fan of the sauces.  Service was alright but our waitress kept forgetting things, \"remind me again what you ordered?\" My search for decent KFC in toronto continues, sigh...."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday afternoon and there was no wait. This place doesn't live up to all the hype its been getting. We had a table of 4 and we ordered the honey garlic chicken, gold cheese chicken and spicy seafood noodle soup. The chicken was EXTREMELY DRY and I was really disappointed. KFC or Popeyes serves better chicken. I Will not come back."}
{"text":"As a person who is hangry fairly frequently you would think that I would not wait until the hunger strikes to head out, this is rarely the case. Thankfully mymy serve snacks when you order they included popcorn, cabbage and something pickled when I visited and it was enough to keep me happy for the short wait for the food. We should've only ordered one chicken platter to share but as I said we were hangry so we ordered dumplings (they were okay). We had the garlic and soy chicken and it was simply delicious. The portion would've been exactly perfect had we not also ordered the dumplings. The service here was excellent. They had a button on the table and were very prompt. Since we had so much left over our waiter even asked if everything was okay. This is an excellent place and I would recommend it to anyone! I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Whenever I crave Korean fried chicken, I think of this place - so crispy on the outside and so juicy and tender inside...
Only downside is wait time. It saddens me whenever I find a new fav restaurant, it always get so popular. :'( The avg wait time is 35-45mins when you get here around 7pm."}
{"text":"When I came in, no one came to me. I was standing for 10 minutes, and it took more than 20 minutes to take our order. They didn't even bring water till we asked for it. Moreover, the people who came in after us got their food first. It was such a disappointing experience, since we like the chicken here. The one located in North York is waaaaay better. I would never come here again."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night around 9pm and waited for around 30 mins for a table. Excellent and prompt service. Had to ask for water couple times but can't complain when the place is packed + a line up. Ordered half spicy and half original, and Asahi pitcher. Chicken was on point; crispy, juicy and hot. It is a bit more pricey than other KFC places but worth the price. There were enough pieces to feed 3 people. Side dishes were refilled couple times!"}
{"text":"Came here for the second time over the weekend, and first thing to note is that there always seems to be a long wait time.  Long wait to get in the door (there is a small waiting area between the entrance doors that can seat up to 5 people), then a long wait to get the chicken once seated (waited 30 mins+ during both of our visits).  The service is friendly and smiling though, and if you snack on the free popcorn and order an appetizer or two - which arrives pretty quickly - they will tide you over til the chicken arrives.

For our table of 5, we ordered a large soy & garlic, and a half-half portion of original and gold cheese.  Soy garlic leans towards the sweeter side, and though tasty, it does lessen the crispiness of the skin. Original is good on its own, but tastes a bit bland in comparison to the cheese version.

My pick goes to the cheese version, which is basically the fried original, dusted with cheese powder and sprinkled with shredded cheese which melts over the top.  It forms a cheesy layer while still the chicken skin still retains its crispy deliciousness: the perfect foil to the moist and tender meat within. Yummy."}
{"text":"I ate the original fried chicken and the chicken in spicy sauce. The chicken was absolutely amazing! I liked how there was so much more meat compared to other similar Korean-style fried chicken restaurants. I found the items on the menu to be slightly more expensive but it is worth the cost. The side dishes were under-seasoned in my opinion, especially the radish.
I am definitely coming back for the end-of-the-year celebration."}
{"text":"I visited with my friends for some Korean-style fried chicken. I tried the original, cheese, and with sweet sauce. The original fried chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The cheese fried chicken had lots of melted cheese on top. The sauce was not spicy at all and had a hint of ginger. The servers were responsive and prompt. The food came in late (25+ minutes after ordering) even though it was half empty inside. I still enjoyed the overall experience.
The only thing I didn't like about the restaurant was that the washroom had an open sink shared by everyone. I felt somewhat self-conscious while looking in the mirror, knowing that others (especially girls) could be seeing me or washing hands next to me.
I think this place serves some of the best Korean-style fried chicken in town. I also liked the current promotion, where I could get french fries for free for sharing a photo on IG. I would love to come back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Meh. Went to mymy chicken after hearing about it from a Korean Vlogger on youtube. Was surprised that there was one near where I live. The fried chicken was pretty expensive at $19 per person! To be honest, it was just average fried chicken. The pieces were randomly cut, so you couldn't tell which part of the chicken it is until you bite into it, so the portions may look large, but there are a lot of inedible parts like the spine of the chicken etc. The atmosphere was very loud, and the servers were not very nice. There is no free parking, so prepare to park on the street if you are driving. For $19 + tip, it was not worth it. I have had better fried chicken at fast food places for a lot less."}
{"text":"The first 2 times I came to mymychicken I had an amazing experience. Quick service great food, music, and I loved their flavoured makgeolli. If you're a kpop fan you'd love it.
The third time I visited was not so great. It took more than an hour just the get a seat, getting the waiters attention was difficult. This might simply be because Korean fried chicken is the shit now, but an hour + for a seat? yea. The food was still great tho."}
{"text":"Ordered the three of a kind and enjoyed it among 4. We still had some left to take home. The chicken is juicy and tender. The free shrimp crackers are pretty bomb too"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday afternoon at around 6:30pm. Didn't have to wait for a table but pretty much 20 minutes after we sat down, there was a huge lineup of people waiting to be seated. The restaurant isn't small, but it isn't big either, so you'll probably want to come a bit earlier especially on the weekend.

We got 1 order of boneless Garlic & Soy Sauce Chicken ($27 + $2 boneless option) and an order of spicy ddeukbokki ($10). Before we got our food, the waiter brought us free side dishes/appetizers: popcorn chips, cabbage salad, and pickled radish. Cabbage and radish go very well with fried, greasy food in my opinion.

The garlic & soy sauce chicken was very delicious. It had tons of flavour and was juicy and crispy. Compared to other KFC joints, I would say that Mymy uses less batter. This is neither a good or bad thing, it just depends on your preferences. The portion size is a tad bit disappointing for the price though, especially when compared to The Fry. The ddeukbokki was alright. I'm not a huge fan of ddeukbokki so I can't really say much.

Overall, the food here is tasty and our waiter was very friendly. I would definitely come back here to try the other flavours of chicken."}
{"text":"We ordered the half/half gold cheese & seasoned spicy ($28) and spicy rice cake ($10). 
This was our first time at a korean fried chicken place and expected the menu to show how many wings or by pounds how much each order was. As it turns out: one order = one chicken. 

Spicy rice cake was really good - very chewy and hot. The dish was kind of oversized though. We were on a small table with just 2 people so we had to finish this before the wings came or else it would not have fit. I would have liked if we could have got it all at once and dipping the wings in the spicy rice cake sauce would have been cool. 

Gold Cheese - cheese flavour wasn't particularly strong but it was interesting  and I liked this.
Seasoned Spicy - not very spicy and had more of a sweet flavour to it. 
Ordering both was a good mix between the two. 

Be sure to come early (we got there around 6:30PM and just beat a huge line of people that came after). 

What we ordered was more than enough for 2 people."}
{"text":"Not sure when this placed opened, but I have only recently discovered this gem. This place will now be my go to place in North York for when I want a good fill of Korean fried chicken because the portions here are huge, and I mean like an order is enough to fill two full grown men. I got the spicy seasoning chicken and it was good and all, but if it was a bit more spicy it would be perfect. 

Why I gave this place a 3 star instead of 5 is because that the breading for the chicken is a tad bit on the soft side. I prefer a more crisp texture for my fried chicken."}
{"text":"Contrary to the hours listed on here, hours are Monday-Sunday 4PM to 2AM.  Mymy Chicken is below a condo apartment off busy Yonge St. which offers only street parking. The restaurant signage would suggest bright and colourful decor, but inside Mymy Chicken it is dimly lit and lined with wooden tables ideal for a party size of 4-6.  You are seated with a few appetizer dishes (always my favourite part).

Initially I expected Mymy Chicken to be a chicken wing place - it turns out you get a whole chicken!  As such, ordering boneless chicken will make the experience that much better. We tried the split flavours of spicy/cheese and the portions were enough for two. Cheese flavour was dry, the spicy flavour had quite a bit of sauce.  I must say the crunchiness and texure is pretty unique - more crunchy than KFC but much less oily than Popeye's. The meat is admittedly more dry, probably because less oil was used.  

There are quite a number of flavours to try, will come by to try again."}
{"text":"Fried chicken galore. 

I ordered the boneless curry flavoured chicken, as well as the stir-fried chicken in a sweet and spicy sauce (2 ). I would come to regret choosing the latter.. Lol. 

The stir-fried chicken comes with rice cakes, sweet potatoes and I believe something else, but I can't recall what.. Anyways, we ordered a basket of french fries along with the chicken and they were terrific (I mean, it's pretty hard to mess up fries). The flavor for the stir-fried chicken wasn't too bad, but the spiciness definitely overpowered everything and it was no longer enjoyable after a few pieces of chicken. The curry, on the other hand was absolutely delicious. We totally ordered too much chicken for just the two of us though (one dish comes with plenty of chicken for two, I would say even 3..)

Service was very prompt and friendly. No complaints. We went on a Friday night and it was pretty busy as expected, but we lucked out and got a table quickly since it was just the two of us. 

I would definitely come back to try the other flavours offered. Would also probably go with drumsticks instead of boneless next time as well.

4.25/5."}
{"text":"It's been hard for me to indulge in Korean fried chicken back here in Canada after going through what had been a life-changing experience for me with fried chicken in Korea itself. I must say though, Mymy Chicken has probably been the closest to the fried chicken I've had in Korea. 

Initially before you order, you're given a few appetizers. Popcorn, salad, and the essential: pickled radish (aka the staple that goes with fried chicken... or the 'coleslaw' of KFC) I thought the popcorn was unique, though interesting that I would be snacking before I eat. 

We ordered rice cake with an extra topping of cheese. To my surprise, I enjoyed the rice cake despite the fact that it lacked spiciness, and that's key to spicy rice cake. However, the rice cake itself was nicely cooked and chewy and there was definitely enough to share between two people (possibly three if you order something else)

Lemme tell you bout dat chicken doe. It comes out burning hot so I suggest you wait for it to cool down a bit - I've learnt that the hard way. We got the original flavour which was seasoned all throughout so you're not left with chewing on dry chicken that tastes like nothing. As well, the chicken breast is definitely not on the dry side, given that majority of the dish was fried chicken breast - but could be a little more tender. 

The ambience is definitely meant for a young age group, judging from their extensive loud music consisting of only  Chainsmokers lolz. (Yup I was judging) Either way I'm looking forward to coming back and trying out the rest of the flavours!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go with a group for some wings and beer! The half and half wings are a great choice! I enjoyed the spicy and cheddar wings. On another occasion, I ordered the dry pepper child wings and was disappointed. I only got 2 small wings and the rest were all chicken scraps. Definitely ordering the half and half next time! 

The music was VERY loud! TOO loud for a place like that - we had to yell at each other to have a conversation with someone sitting next to you. 

The service is great and the apps compliment the food!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with a group of 5 at a very packed restaurant. There was a waitlist so we put our name down and waited 25 mins. The waiting area wasn't very large so we stood in the narrow entrance to wait. While waiting, we patiently observed the patrons receving and eating their food. The fried chicken looked promising as it did in the photos and I couldn't wait until it was our turn.

Once seated, we noticed the chicken was priced higher than expected. It was around 30 dollars for each style. There was an option to do half and half, so we chose the onion and cheesey chicken (strangely advertised as 'women's pick'). As well, we got an order or fries and handmade dumplings.

We got our sides of popcorn, cubed pickled radish, and picked cabbage which is perfect to snack on and to cut the fattiness of the fried chicken. Our fries and dumplings arrived quickly soon after. These fries were amazing! Really crispy and a large amount. The dumplings looked really appetizing and was served with a dip to compliment it. Unfortunately, the meat inside was flavourless and fell short in delivery.

The chicken arrived and I really liked the crispness of the skin. However, it was moist inside for some pieces and really dry in others. I liked the onion more than the cheese.. The cheese felt like it wasn't meshing with the chicken itself and more as an interesting add-on.

All in all, I enjoyed the experience and atmosphere of the restaurant. However, I do like the Fry's chicken more. I think a fair comparison would be to try the green onion chicken to see which is more worth it. However, I would love to try more of the apps here because I think it would be done well for the most part."}
{"text":"Ordered the half and half for $29 - original and golden cheese. I like them both but found the golden cheese is better even though I'm not a cheese fans. The original is good but after a few pieces it'll just taste like regular fried chicken. The portion is good for 2-3 people and it's around 8-9 pieces per flavor for my half and half so total is 16-18pcs, which I think it's not bad for $29 and I do have a few pcs leftover for lunch :) Will probably come back again if around the area. One thing i don't really like is, it takes long to have the order ready probably because the time to fry the chickens are long? So if you're in hurry so this not a good idea to go."}
{"text":"Called to put an order for a pickup. Received a call after 10 minutes saying my order was ready, however when I got there to pick up my order, I had to wait 10 minutes. Then, I received my chicken and noticed that I received the wrong order when I got home, which ended up costing extra $$. I called the restaurant to notify this and was told that they would call me back. It took them 20 minutes while I consistently tried to call them and didn't pick up the phone. They offered to give me another chicken, which would make me go there again to pick it up."}
{"text":"We ordered half & half - gold cheese and seasoned spicy. Prior to ordering this we asked them if we could choose our own combos for the half & half but they said we couldn't. We really wanted to try their soy garlic flavour but we would have to get a full order of it which is too much for two people. So we chose their gold cheese and seasoned spicy combo. 

Their seasoned spicy was delicious, it was sweet and not too spicy, which I like. If you love spicy, this might not be spicy enough for you. I would rate the sauce a 4/5. Chicken itself was crispy. Keep in mind that if you don't like white meat for chicken, you're better off going to The Fry or something. I personally didn't like how they use white meat as I prefer the chicken more juicy. The gold cheese just seemed like their original fried chicken sprinkled with some cheddar cheese and cheese powder. Overall taste was not bad but I think they could have incorporated the cheese in a more interesting way and not just sprinkled it on top like a garnish."}

{"text":"Been to mymy chicken 5 times now and I have to say their chicken is one of the best Korean fried chicken in town.  I love the gold cheese one and the green onion. Seafood pancake is good as well.  I say only the fry might be better than mymy right now.  I have tried 95% of the Korean chicken place except for chicken Monster will I will check out next time. Will be back here shortly as I am always down for deep fried chicken."}
{"text":"Location/Service:
The restaurant is on a side street along Yonge, north of Sheppard. Street parking and limited parking lot is available (note street parking is free after 9pm)

Inside the restaurant is a bit dark, but nice ambience feeling. Quite a bit of seating available, but most of the time you might have to wait to be seated. I went there twice after 9pm and only waited about 10-15min. 

Nice service - they have a bell to ring and usually respond quick. Both waiters/waitresses are good looking (some eye candy)


Food:
Menu options limited, but they have a few mix and match flavors to try for their chicken. 

Tried their combo of spicy chicken and cheese chicken. Both are fried to the same standard, not overly battered and crispy on the outside. The meat inside is a little dry (cause it's white meat after all), but the spicy one has a good sauce for you to dip it in. Portions are huge and shareable with a party of 3-4. 

Also tried their spicy rice cake with added cheese and fried seaweed. I really liked this dish. Again with good portions, sauce and crunchy taste of the fried seaweed. 

They also have beer on tap and of course, soju. 


Overall, I like this place and it's a perfect spot
to get together late at night or go out for a snack."}
{"text":"Won't be going back again.  Don't like that you have to order the whole chicken.  I don't like breast meat, very dry and tasteless.  The Fry is still my favourite."}
{"text":"This is the my favorite Korean fried chicken restaurant in town. You could taste many different types as well as flavors of fried chicken. The plenty choices will satisfy most of your demands, and I prefer saucy ones. The rice cake pan is also good tasting with korean alcohols. This place opens until 2:00 in the morning. It will be a really great choice for late night meal."}
{"text":"New hot Korean style fried chicken place. It's a franchise from Korea and it does tastes like the ones you can get in Korea. If you are a fried chicken fan, who isn't, you gotta try this place out. Chicken is bit pricy but beer/drinks are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great korean fried chicken. Decent amount of flavours, open late on weekends.  Fried chicken is served with rice cake mixed in."}
{"text":"We came here after dinner on a late Saturday night and this place was packed! We waited a good 45 minutes for a table for 7 adults. It was definitely a challenge because larger groups tend to stay for a really long time to drink and chat. So coming here in smaller groups is definitely an advantage. 

The environment is dim but the atmosphere is great! They play music throughout the night, projecting an energetic and vibrant vibe. Definitely set the mood for friends to get together for drinks and chit chats!

Food:  Their fried chickens are well-seasoned and very crispy, hot and fresh. We ordered 3 different fried chicken dishes to try. And I enjoyed the seasoned & cheese flavour and the gold cheese flavour the most. The curry chicken although has a very strong curry aroma, it doesn't taste like curry upon tasting it. And I personally prefer fried chicken with some kind of dipping sauce. This particular one is seasoned with curry powder only so is a bit dry. We also tried their hot fish soup with assorted fish cakes which was decent. Overall, their portion is generous and great for sharing. 

Service: They were attentive and made an effort to help give us a table sooner since we waited for so long. At the end, they combined two tables of 4 for us. We were the last group to leave the restaurant and instead of rushing us, one of the servers politely informed us that they were closing in 10 minutes."}
{"text":"My my my. THIS CHICKEN IS DELICIOUS. It'll be your new go to for Korean fries chicken.

We arrived around 7:30 one Friday evening and waited approximately one hour to be seated (they don't accept reservations). The staff there were wonderful from beginning to end. You have go to the front where the cash register is and put your name down, but you are free to leave and come back later. We did this and they gave us free popcorn to go (so nice!)

We ordered grape soju $17 (can anyone tell me if there's an lcbo in toronto that sells the grape flavour?), onion rings $6, seasoned spicy chicken $29 and green onion chicken $28 (group of 4). The food took approximately 20 minutes to come out (hot!) and was more than enough to feed four hungry people.

The seasoned spicy chicken has a mix of a sweet and spicy tangy flavour, where as the green onion had mustard undertones. All chicken was delicious fried, but not too dry or over cooked. 

There's some unlimited small snacks that come with your order- cabbage, radish and popcorn.

We'd definitely come back to try their other flavors, but perhaps later at night (10pm) when the wait is shorter. The bill came to approximately $25 per person."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go as far as to say that this restaurant brings anything new to fried chicken, but they definitely do it right and I'd say this is probably some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. 

The classic friend chicken with a side order of fries were delicious. Service is good too, so you really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"With many Korean fried chicken places popping up recently, this one just doesnt seem all that special. We got the half cheese/half original sauce wings. The flavours were lacking a bit in my opinion. Slow service  Overall, meh."}
{"text":"If you're craving Korean fried chicken, I highly recommend this place. My friend and I decided to try this place out since we've been to The Fry many times, and now, I like Mymy Chicken a lot more! We ordered the half-half chicken, where you get to choose 2 flavours. I heard that only at the Bloor location can you mix and choose 2 different flavours from the menu. So we decided to get the garlic&soy + creamy cheese chicken. Both flavours were amazing!! The creamy cheese chicken is now my favourite kind of chicken. You also receive some free appetizers (shrimp chips + radish). We also ordered the fries as well. I love coming here!"}
{"text":"Food here is actually really good. Quality is great. The pricing is not the cheapest, but I would say it's well worth the money. Service was not bad either. Will come back and will for sure recommend going!"}
{"text":"We had such high expectations today. We have been here several times before, and it has grown to be our favorite go-to place for quality fried chicken... But today. They sat us in a corner, took our food order, then forgot about us to the point where two other tables around us got seated, ordered and got their food before we had to call on them. We ordered a green onion fried chicken and an oden. Only the chicken came, which was spicy and delicious, but some more prompting brought the realization that they had completely forgotten about the oden... Very disappointed.  If it wasn't so, I would be singing high praises along with everyone else, but when you're hangry and an order is completely neglected, no amount of poppy loud music is going to improve this customers' experience today."}
{"text":"Came around 6 PM on a weekend, after having snacked on some fried chicken at Monga just half an hour prior. It was surprisingly not as busy as I thought it would be, as only half the restaurant was filled. However closer to 7, then the lines started getting long.

Overall interior looks nice, with low lighting. The only light comes in from the windows at the front, so it can get a bit dark. Washrooms are quite large, strangely shaped, and somewhat sticky.

When it comes to chicken options, they have about a dozen flavors, but for some reason, if you're looking for half-and-half, they have a separate section for that and only have 3 options to choose from. Seems a bit strange to me, since it doesn't seem like that much of a stretch to just  prepare any two halves of each flavor...

Being a korean restaurant, they have bells on the tables that you can use to call for service.
However, it looks like not every table has them, and if you try to ring up a bell on another table, a server will come over to that table, ask them if they need anything, be told that it was the other table that called them, and still not get any service cause it wasn't that server's table. A quick glance appears that only the larger tables have bells while smaller tables do not.

We ordered the boned regular + seasoned spicy half-and-half. The order takes awhile to prepare. Almost 15-20 minutes passed before the chicken arrived. The table beside us were there before us and they also waited quite awhile before they received theirs. The server also brought their order to us, and only after we asked about it did he realize he brought it to the wrong table.

There were 17 pieces in total between the two plates that arrived. Since all the chicken were boned, you get an assortment of random pieces of wings, thighs, or legs. The chicken was hot and fresh, which should be expected given such a long wait. The skin was crisp and well-seasoned, and the meat was tender and juicy. I'm not a fan of sauce, and found the original chicken to be a great choice. They also have chicken with cheese...which can be interesting."}
{"text":"Came in right when they opened at 4 PM, so we got their only booth seats. It's a pretty nice spot since you've got curtains that you can pull down for privacy.

Ordered their three of a kind deal and picked Original, Seasoned Spicy, and Honey Garlic. Side dishes were offered consisting of radishes and sliced cabbage. Refills available.

Chicken was prepared within 20 minutes.The meat in general was pretty dry, but the skin was nice and crisp and not greasy at all. I enjoyed the original the most because of this; the other saucy ones weren't as interesting because the meat was dry, and the sauces weren't that great.

Apparently, one of the pieces was juicy, but I didn't get to taste that one. Definitely need to improve their consistency."}
{"text":"Went today for dinner. Got the $28 chicken set. Half and half spicy and cheese set. The spicy one was not that spicy but it was very flavourful and very well marinated. The cheesy one was not very cheesy as it was marinated with cheese powder I thought it would be melted cheese. Other than that the chicken was one of the best I have had so far in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Amazing Korean chicken ! Friendly staff too! It was our first time trying Korean chicken and we bothered the staff to help us pick. She was extremely patient and walked us through what most popular items were"}
{"text":"Closer to a 3.5. Tried the golden cheese and seasoned spicy fried chicken with bone in. We got takeout. The seasoned spicy is really good. Lots of flavour. The cheese one was good too but I preferred the seasoned spicy. I had also tried the original before and wasn't huge on that one. 

We tried the spicy rice cakes too and didn't like it that much. The sauce was spicy but not that flavourful."}
{"text":"I am no expert on Korean Fried Chicken but I have had a couple of memorable samples of it in New York and LA. Clearly I have some catching up to do here in Toronto because it seems to be a thing. And Mymy Chicken appears to be a great place to start. The atmosphere is really quite nice, the tables not crowded, and even though it was bustling, the noise level was energetic (but not annoying). 

We ordered the combo half Golden (cheese) and half Seasoned Spicy (the \"Best\" combo according to the menu) plus a beer and a bottle of Soju to split. Even though the place was full, the order came right away. The service was friendly and efficient. 

Two things fried chicken need to be are 1) hot and 2) juicy. Big marks on both counts for Mymy. 

The chicken with finely grated cheese and cheese powder was a curious flavour. The cheese powder has the kind of taste usually reserved for Doritos or Au Gratin potato chips. Together with fried chicken, this is a taste profile that is unusual but oddly addictive. 

The Seasoned Spicy Chicken was covered in a sweet sticky sauce that displayed hints of cinnamon. It wasn't what I would normally gravitate towards (I like a drier actually spicy type) but again it was also oddly addictive. The fried chicken underneath was very good. At $29 for the combo the amount of chicken we got was generous, and we did manage to control ourselves and walked out with leftovers.

Overall even if the flavors were unfamiliar I am giving this place a solid 4 because I think what they do, they do really well. We will be back to try some of the other styles, but in the meantime we have quite a few other places to check out as we do a shallow dive into Toronto's Asian fried chicken scene."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of KFC so when I was notified about this place from more than one source I had a feeling that it was something I had to try. I was sort of excited for Mymy because I was told this was a Korean chain sort of like Bonchon (which I've still never had) but since this place was a chain from Korea they'd have a rather more authentic approach to it.  

You see, I'm not one to know authenticity when it comes to this food that I've fallen for neck deep in sauce... no, I've never been to Korea or had whatever is supposed to be considered some sort of unofficial standard for KFC.  

I do however ALWAYS pull out the ruler.  The ruler is that thing I measure against other KFC places and their offerings.  That ruler's name is Turntable Chicken Jazz in NYC.  The reason this ruler exists is because it's when I was first introduced to KFC and it has for me at least set the standard for what everything else will be measured against because to date I've yet to find anything as good, period.  There are really, many Korean fried chicken places in Toronto and I've been to so many of them but nothing and I repeat nothing has reached the pinnacle of how I measure Turntable with all of their offerings.  

If Mymy is supposed to be a good representation of how KFC is supposed to be in Korea then I have to say I do in fact really like it... very much, a lot.  It's very good but not as good as what Turntable creates or for that matter as good as say what Kaboom in Toronto makes.  

Whatever authenticity aside, subjective opinion and other preferences as well... Mymy is a good, solid place to have KFC.  The food we had ordered was of a good quality and decent portion.  The prices however seemed rather a bit high which is about 25 to 28 dollars per full order and some choices have the option to be boneless for another 2 bucks.  

The pieces are made up of full chickens which are drums, wings, breast, thighs, etc cut up in a rather organized way, sauced in whatever way was ordered (or without sauce) and basketed in that familiar red and white checker pattern paper.  We had ordered one half/half basket of spicy and original which came in separate half order baskets along with 2 full orders which were one of \"retro\" and \"honey garlic\".  The retro in the photo looked different almost like what you'd find at Turntable but alas it was basically just a lightly battered take on \"original\" it seemed.  Hopes up and shot down sort of but the offering is still very good.  The honey garlic was sticky and tasty while the original and spicy are not that unfamiliar from what you can find just about anywhere.  

Mymy's chicken is good, it tastes good, the quality is probably better than most and the sauce isn't greatly exaggerated.  The service which I have to point out, it was in fact excellent.  I hate to compare but many other places that serve KFC... their service is suspect to say the least.  It's almost an ongoing joke I have with my friends.  From being given items we didn't order to giving us the bill without asking for it some of our KFC restaurant experiences have been poor.  Mymy has friendly and excellent service on the contrary and our server was very polite and attentive.  

As far as their product goes it's very good, probably above average of what you may find around town and the ambiance is also good but dem prices tho... almost 30 bucks pre tax for an order is sort of high.  It can simply be considered a higher end place I suppose if I had to put a label on it.  It's casual sure but not a dive and I suppose their pricing structure reflects that.

There are many other KFC places in North York and around Toronto and it seems to be gaining popularity.  I love that this is happening in Toronto.

If there was a case for a 3.5 this would be it but I always round down so I can only give Mymy a 3*.  If it was say 2/3 the pricing I'd consider it maybe a 4*.

Good quality, good variety, great service, a little more than other places but better than many out there."}
{"text":"The good
- Well-cooked chicken. Moist inside and crispy on the outside
- Large portion. One order includes about 8-10 pieces, good enough for 2-3 people. 

The bad 
- Music volume was far too loud. It was like we were sitting inside a club, difficult to carry a conversation."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant out with some friends the other night and the portions look small but are very filling. The food was great and came out quickly except they forgot one of our orders but it wasnt really a big problem as they resolved it quickly. However the restaurant itself is very cramped - we were literally back to back with the table behind us to the point where we couldnt even pull the bench out all the way and had to squeeze ourselves in. Also the place is very dark too so I overall felt a little claustrophobic."}
{"text":"New KFC place in town and this is great! Although a little bit expensive than the usual kfc place, I think it's worth it. They also give you popcorn as their side. 

We had their green onion boneless fried chicken, I believe they mixed wasabi into their sauce so beware! At the end of our meal, the server made a mistake on our bill but he was quick to fix it. Overall, this is a good place to eat kfc than going to your usual the fry or home of hot taste!"}
{"text":"A renewed faith in this place. We returned for the 3rd time (second time was a little disappointing), and was again, thoroughly impressed. We decided to change things up and order different items. We landed on the honey and garlic sauced chicken, and a side order of fried onion rings. Both were quite good in their execution. The batter used for the Honey garlic was notably different than those of the dry seasoning variety. The batter was thicker, heavier, and subsequently crisper than the flakier and lighter batter of the golden chicken. The change in batter was much appreciated as it carried the sauce a lot better without losing its lovely exterior crunch and interior juiciness. An added bonus to keep things interesting, was the addition of fried chewy rice cakes and Korean sweet potatoes, all covered in a generous sprinkling of roast crushed peanuts. The honey sauce, though sweet, was very well complimented by the sweet and sour side plates of pickled radishes and cabbages. We packed some of the meal home to enjoy later that night and the crispiness held up surprisingly well.

A little tip, we arrived at about 6pm on a Monday evening, and was seated right away. The early dinner was definitely less hectic than the previous times. Staff were friendly and gracious. If you are there just for the food, come early and come not too hungry as it takes a bit of time for the food to arrive."}
{"text":"Finally I don't have to trek up to North York to get some MyMy chicken fix! So far I think it's probably one of the best kfc in town. A big pricier than other places but it's worth it."}
{"text":"So I was craving for Two Two chicken from Myeongdong. My friend suggested Mymy chicken. I ordered the curry chicken with bones. It just made my day. The meat was tender and juicy and the batter was not too over oily and heavy. Usually I don't eat salad and the coleslaw was pretty good. Overall, a nice meal and made my crappy Monday way better. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"So I came to mymy chicken with my family while we're on vacation to Toronto. The chicken isn't bad but I've definitely had better Korean chicken for half the price. First of all I think the \"$$\" on the yelp page is kind of misleading. Most of the chicken there is around $24 and up and including tax and tip is clearly a \"$$$\".
One of the biggest issues I had with this place is how inflexible the menu is. Essentially you can't mix and match any of their unique flavors. You can't get a half serving of anything besides their basic flavors. So you have to pay for the full serving for the unique flavors and a lot of them range $25+ which is kind of ridiculous. 

I got their green onion fried chicken and my brother got their extreme spicy chicken. Their extreme spicy chicken is inedible. My brother can pretty much eat any spicy food you can imagine, but their spicy chicken had no real flavor. It was just spicy to the point where it didnt taste good. Their green onion fried chicken was good. I don't think I would pay around $28 for it again.  Again, I've had better Korean fried chicken for half the price and the same serving size.

The interior is pretty and trendy. The service was good as well. The servers were very nice!

Overall, it was okay. I think paying almost $60 for \"meh\" fried chicken is not worth it."}
{"text":"Tucked in an alley near Yonge/Sheppard, Mymy Chicken is in my opinion the BEST Korean fried chicken in the Yonge/Finch-Sheppard area. I've tried The Fry, Kokoya, Dagoki, Cheers Chicken and Beer, etc etc. The crispness and taste is unmatched and you should definitely come here. Like go, right now. 

Food ****
I've tried the onion, green onion, gold cheese, and the chili fried chicken here. My faves are definitely the gold cheese and green onion (budak). Price is standard for KFC places ($~28 ish for a whole chicken that can feed 2-3 people) and they have the usual sides you can order like fries, egg soup, rice cake, etcetc. They have some unique alcohol so be sure to try one or two.

Service ***
Service was good, they have one of those buttons so you can call the waiter and they never seemed to be understaffed regardless if the restaurant was full or not although it doesnt seem that there are buttons on every table.

Ambiance ****
Decor is rustic but still comfy, really liked the vibe eating there and it always attracts a young crowd. This place can get full so be sure to plan accordingly, especially during Friday/Saturdays

Tips/Closing comments
- Order half/half and try different flavours
- Try to get there early on busy nights (Thurs/Fri/Sat)
- If you're a fried chicken lover don't think twice about trying this place"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken ever! We waited for almost an hour for a table for 5. But it's definitely worth the wait. Onion flavor is my personal favorite. Second favorite is the Golden Cheese flavor. Soya sauce and garlic flavor and seasoned spice are great choices too. I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"In my pursuit for Korean fried chicken in Toronto, to rival that of Bon Chon and Boka (New York), it was time to give MyMy Chicken a try. We went on a Friday night and had a bit of a wait before getting seated. Interestingly, they'll give you a minimum to maximum wait time. When we went to follow up on the status of our table, we were told it would be a minimum of 10 minutes and a maximum of 30 minutes.

The menu suggests they have 6 styles of fried chicken: Original, Gold Cheese, Onion, Chili Pepper, Curry, Retro. Wanting to try a variety of styles, we order two orders from their Half & Half menu. The Half & Half menu comes with preselected choices, and you can't pick which two you wanted to do half and half of. We were given a side popcorn, radishes and pickled cabbage to start, which we all enjoyed.

The consensus was that the Seasoned Spicy was the best. It was probably more of a medium spicy, and was sweet as well. Our second favourite was the Onion, which kinda tasted like sour cream and onion chips. It was a toss-up between the Original and Gold Cheese. The smell of the cheese on the Gold Cheese was there, but the taste was lacking. The Original was pretty basic, and nothing special. At $27 per order, it may seem a bit pricey, but it is a generous portion. With two portions split three ways, we each had plenty left to take home.

Service was friendly and attentive, but the fried chicken isn't enough for me to wait again. If given the choice between MyMy Chicken and the nearby The Fry, I would choose The Fry."}
{"text":"I usually go to the location on yonge and sheppard, but since a lot of my friends live in downtown we decided to check this one out. I came with a group of 6 and ordered quite a lot (food and beer). The food was really good, I even think it's better than the location on yonge. However, the service here is far beyond anything I've ever experienced. Not only did the waitresses were not attentive, they were almost no where to be seen. My friend had to go to the bar directly to buy a drink almost 4 times. Truly though, it's not a big deal. We were having so much fun on our own and we didn't really need anyone's attention. However, when the bill came we paid with about 20% tips AND THE WAITRESSES HAD THE AUDACITY TO ASK US FOR MORE TIPS. I was so shocked and it actually ruined our experience with this restaurant/chain. Not only is it embarrassing having someone come up to our table and asking us for more money, but NO ONE on the staff was even there to help us. I don't even know who the tips are going to since no one helped us, just speechless."}
{"text":"What you're looking at is a basket of original and cheese fried chicken. There's a lot of meat on the bone (which is good) but it is just shy of dry (which is bad). For me, the juicier, the better. The cheese one looked nice but it's not all that. Mymy Chicken isn't Mymy first pick."}
{"text":"Between my friend and I, we ordered the \"Three of a Kind\" combo with Original + Seasoned Spicy + Golden Cheese = which adds up to 1.5 chicken

We were silly to think that we'd be able to finish everything.. 

I liked the texture of the Original the most! It was deep fried really well and the skin was very crispy. Second favourite would be the Golden Cheese, but the meat for this one was more on the drier side. Nonetheless, if you like cheese, then feel free to give this a try (although it wasn't as cheesy as I had imagined). Least favourite then - would be the Seasoned Spicy. It wasn't bad, but I just didn't enjoy that kind of spice as much. 

Each table was also offered a bowl of salad and Korean chips."}
{"text":"I will give this place some shiny five stars! 
Came here unplanned and came out super happy! The place was so packed (in my head: I wont get those fried chicken) but we were seated in less than 10 mins! Wow, I like this place already. 

We were then seated and given some appetizers. Apps here consists of two kinds of pickled radishes & popcorn! Yes, they have their own popcorn machine. So awesome.

As first timers, we decided to order the Garlic & Soy Sauce Chicken, my favourite seasoning ($27). And it was the best garlic and soy sauce chicken I have ever tasted! The chicken was tender all the way to the bones, crispy on the outside and flavourful. And the portion can feed 2-3 people. Their sweet potatoes are also delicious. Thinly sliced and fried perfectly. Lastly, the service here was excellent!

Im really looking forward to coming back here!"}
{"text":"I love the fried chicken! Amazing flavours and it wasn't too dry or greasy.  They have a variety of flavours to choose from.  It was hard to choose."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out, my friend told me it is a popular chain in South Korea. 
We came here on a rainy Sunday at around 8pm. The restaurant was busy but there were still 2-3 tables available. 

We ordered half and half of seasoned spicy and garlic soy, steamed rice and grapefruit soju. The food took a little longer to come out  than I would've liked but that's probably because it was a busy Sunday evening. 

Both the flavours were good but the chicken was on the dryer side. I had only two pieces before I didn't want to eat anymore. The crispiness and the crunch was good though. 

The service is exactly what one would expect from an Asian restaurant: minimal, which I don't mind unless if I need something and the server is nowhere to be found lol. Overall it was a pretty mediocre experience, I don't think I'll be coming back especially since my fav Korean fried chicken place is a block away."}
{"text":"Food: With the goal of trying more than just one flavour and also not stuffing ourselves senseless we decided to go with the half-half option and ordered the Onion Boneless Chicken and the Golden Cheese Boneless Chicken. Should be noted there are only 4 flavours to choose from with the other two being \"Original\" and \"Seasoned Spicy\". We also got the obligatory \"Seafood Pancake\", a staple at many authentic Korean restaurants. 
Upon placing our orders, we were served with some complimentary appetizers; white radish, pickled cabbage and popcorn. This was a very nice touch and definitely improved our overall experience. The Seafood Pancake came first. It was very large and cooked just right - not too crispy or soggy. Then came the highlight of the night, the chicken. Again, portion size was not a problem so expect to be full. The chicken was very tender and had plenty of original flavour. Only complaint here is the \"Golden Cheese\", while appearing to be extremely appetizing, didn't taste all that special. Imagine eating cheese and chicken. Same can be said about the \"Onion\" flavour, where it's almost as if they got the \"Original\" flavour chicken and put onion rings on it. With that being said I am definitely looking forward to coming back and trying out some of their other flavours! 

Service: The service here was pretty impressive. We were seated right away, granted there wasn't that many customers at 5:30 PM. But still the waiters/waitresses were very attentive and on top of every customer that was entering the restaurant. Water was topped up periodically and the bill came promptly. Many other restaurants can definitely learn a thing or two from Mymy Chicken. No complaints here. 

Atmosphere: Dark. That's all that there is really to say about the atmosphere for this place. Finding lighting for our food pics was definitely a challenge. On the other hand, you can definitely pull off date night here but expect there to be lots of conversations around you and fairly loud music in the background.

Verdict: Very solid first-time experience here. In my opinion the best Korean fried chicken in the area. Definitely going to come back for some of their other chicken options and hopefully not strike out on the choice of flavours again!"}
{"text":"All their fried chicken dishes are delicious. We had the cheese chicken, spicy chicken, green onions chicken, rolled eggs, rice cake with fish cakes, and a fish cake soup. It was all delicious. Would go back again."}
{"text":"My oh my. I love fried chicken and I'm pretty consistent customer at the Fry at the Wellesley location, but the batter cannot compare to the batter at Mymy. The batter is light and crispy, and the chicken is tender and juicy AF. 

The server (who might the owner) was SUPER attentive and nice. Even when we took out the rest for takeout and tried to pack the radishes, he wouldn't let us and instead gave us a fresh pack of radishes that they usually use for takeout. 

The one downfall is that their seasonings are really light in comparison to the Fry. Their spicy chicken isn't at all spicy and you can only really taste it in the after taste. If there was a bit more of the seasoning, I would almost prefer it the Fry, but I'm a saucy gal and the spicy sauce at the Fry reigns over Mymy - but that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"Quality of food 3/5
Service 2/5
Atmosphere 3/5
Overall 2.5/5 

Walking into my my chicken i had a craving for Korean fried chicken. So i decided to get the half and half. The person i went with wanted the cheese spread fried chicken, while i got the spicy fried chicken, so we shared with a side of fries and corn. When the food arrived, we had almost finished our sides as the food took a while. A few bites into the chicken and my friend had a puking sensation so we decided to just take it out for later. When paying the bill we left a $3 tip as we didnt stay too long and recieved barely any service. The lady came by as we were about to leave and told us that the tips not included in the bill, and expected U.S. to tip even more. This was mad because she provided us next to no service. We ended up tipping her $5 extra because she wouldnt let us leave with tipping $3. All in all a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Uhmmmmmmmmm, one order of chicken costs $27-$28? Does this mean the chicken is made of gold? Not sure but I have never been to a restaurant that charges that much for just a average bowl of fried chicken. Anyway I ordered fire chicken and my friend wanted the pepper Chili chicken. The taste is not bad, definitely way better than \"the fry\" down the street. Total cost of the meal was around $60 excluding taxes.....Damn I felt like I paid for a seafood Michelin star dish"}
{"text":"Best korean fried chicken ever!!! Very good service too. I will definitely come back. Pricing is a bit high but I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 7 on a Thursday night, the place was surprisingly very full on a weekday. The parking on Yonge was very limited... took all of us a good 15 mins even though most of us car pooled. The surrounding music was very loud that we could barely hear each other... luckily they realized this towards the end & turned down the volume.

We ordered goat cheese chicken, spicy & sweet chicken & onion chicken. We were slightly disappointed with the cheese chicken & seasoned soy sauce chicken.... don't get me wrong the presentation was very IG worthy but the cheese chicken itself was a bit dry & too thick.. while the spicy & sweet was way too saucy & sweet for our liking.. wasn't spicy at all. There was a little surprise of fried sweet potato & fried sticky rice cake which we found in the spicy & sweet to be very unique. Nonetheless, we did enjoy the chicken the onion chicken a lot."}
{"text":"Ordered fries when it wasnt busy but they forgot the order...then it got really busy (Friday around 7) and when the chicken came, we asked where the fries were....They said it'll come right away ...Took well over 5 minutes

Food is ok but nothing special ...Service isn't attentive enough 

They had roughly 4 servers (one girl...Older woman...Two guys) but it seemed like the young girl was doing almost everything and the guys were just laid back 

I wouldn't come back here...just based on the chicken and the fries (which are from Costco), there's nothing that stands out about this place other than the slow service and greater seating capacity vs  \"Cheers\" and \"The Fry.\" Actually, food-wise, I think their competition is better."}
{"text":"One of the best fried Korean fried chicken you can find in Toronto. Not greasy and huge portions. Love the environment in the restaurant also. No frills here. Definitely get the seasons spicy chicken. Best value is to get the 3 flavours. You get to try multiple and see which one you really enjoy."}
{"text":"I went to this Korean fried chicken place with my cousin based on the recent reviews. We ordered the garlic soy fried chicken and some yam fries. Like most Korean places, they gave us some sides which included popcorn, radish and some sour cabbage.

The chicken had some potatoes and rice cake served in the same dish but I found the chicken dry and not as tasty as other places in the area. I was so disappointed since there were so many other options. The place was big and plenty of tables which meant no wait. 

Not sure if I would return again but the service was good."}
{"text":"Oh Mymy, you will always be mymy favourite~~ I shouldn't be such a hypocrite and tell my SO to eat healthier when I have cravings for unhealthy foods just about every week. This chicken is the shiz nizzle. Their batter is just the right thickness, deep fried to a golden yellow and topped with your fave sauce/garnish. We arrived on a Sat night at 7PM. There was a line for any groups larger than 2, but to our surprise a table of 2 was free! 

After some contemplation, we ordered the half and half. We got the spicy chicken and the onion cheese as the green onion wasn't available as a flavour for the Half half *whomp whomp whomp*

Mymy Chicken if you're reading this, please decide to add all the original flavours to the half half! You'd make some very happy KFC lovers here. 

After you order they serve some non-fancy amuse-bouche to you: white radish, grated pickled cabbage and some popcorn. I ordered a coke to wash down the fried chicken (and it's very refreshing when eating foods that create \"hot air\") I prefer Mymy chicken to the Fry and Home of Hot Taste because of their batter - it's got the right amount of crisp, and the chicken isn't dry whatsoever.

The spicy chicken isn't killer spicy and the flavour is closer to a sweeter heat. The cheese (a combo of grated cheese, cheese powder and parsley) chicken was the perfect balance to the sweeter spicy chicken. Chicken is definitely not dry here, and for 2 people, I think the half half combo is a sufficient amount of food. 

With tax and the Coke, our bill came to a little over $30."}
{"text":"First time here got the cheese chicken fries and the steamed egg. Chicken was  the cheese was a little unnecessary on it next time i will definitely get one of the other flavors i was really good and moist and super crispy. I asked for some hot sauce to dip my chicken in and i got what i think was gochuchang with some rice rice syrup mixed in anyways i absolutely loved it. If their spicu chicken has the same sauce its right upmy ally.
The portion was huge i think it was an entire chicken. My husband and i both eat alot and we had like over half of it left over. 
The fries were costco fries aka the best fries ever so that was great. 
The steamed egg was good but I've had better steamed egg and for $10 a little overpriced in my opinion so will not be getting that again.

Service was pretty great very friendly they went through the entire menu with us since it was our first time very fast and responsive. 

All in all top notch late night eats will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We came here with the rationale that you just don't set up another KFC shop so close to the fry without anything special to offer, so we came here to satisfy our fried chicken cravings. The chicken is good, you just need to order accordingly and not order too much (disclaimer: totally our fault). 

First things first, to get this out of the way, you only need to order ONE chicken dish per two people. And even then, you will probably struggle to finish it. We came here with a party of four and got 3 orders of chicken. Don't do that, REGARDLESS how hungry you are! And another thing, this is a whole chicken, so expect all sorts of chicken parts. These are not wings, if you don't like all this goodness, get the boneless bites.

We pretty much sampled everything (hey, we like to eat with our eyes, right?) And my favourite in order was: green? onion, garlic soy, cheese, and then lastly the spicy gochujang based one. We also ordered the teokkbokki which was pretty good. A perfect compliment or appetizer you your chicken. And 
Makgeolli was available, just not on the drink menu, so just ask for it. 

The chicken here was so crispy, so ordering one that isn't fully doused in sauce will allow you to enjoy that. I obviously recommend going with the half-half. The green onion was the best of both world of being sauced and fully crisp. There was plenty of refreshing green onion, in that tasty, sweet sauce without making the chicken overly soggy. I was pretty disappointed with the spicy gochujang one, it was just too soggy, and the sauce just didn't do it for me (and I do like gochujang). I'm not sure if the cheese one was real cheese (it didn't really taste like it, at least for the gooey stringy aspect of it). But it was still pretty nice to have a crispy, cheesy taste - which is really unique! Also the white meat was pretty dry, so another reason to stick with the bones. 

It was really loud here, with loud music loud voices but this is to be expected for these type of places."}
{"text":"We waited 85 minutes for a table of 5 , but I suppose it was busy for a reason.

We ordered 4 flavours of Korean fried chicken, they were all on par with the better chicken joints around. Although the breading and seasoning was heavier than I would expect with Korean fried chicken.

Their green onion fried chicken might be the best I have had in Toronto, lots of points there!

Portions are a tad smaller than the other KFC joints around."}
{"text":"I'm honestly surprised how good this place is. I'm not a fan of chicken but the party wanted some wings and found this on Yelp. No regret. 
It's a pretty busy place with almost every table full in the evening on a Thursday night. 

We ordered three orders and it ended up being almost 100$. We got: Gold Cheese, Green Onion, and Seasoned Spicy. My favorite was the seasoned spicy - just the right amount of flavor. Delicious. 

They gave us three cokes, a bunch of radishes, and green onion with this really good sauce (we ordered togo) and they weren't stingy about the sides. So good. Please give it a try."}
{"text":"Forget The Fry, this is the best Korean Fried Chicken place in downtown Toronto. I ordered the Soy Garlic Fried Chicken and the Seasoned Spicy Fried Chicken. Loved the Soy Garlic one more as it wasn't so sweet but just the right amount. The prices are fair compared to if you were just to go to a regular wing spot. I would recommend this place if you like to go with a group of friends. Would come back!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Got one half and half bone in chicken in original and seasoned spicy. And another full in garlic soy along with a spicy rice cake. Fed 5 of us and there were still leftovers. 20$ each tip included. 

Keep in mind on weekends they don't split bills."}
{"text":"Probably the most authentic kfc in Toronto I've tried so far! We had the golden cheese and the spicy sauce half and half combo. It's SUPER crispy and juicy, fried to perfection without it being greasy (texture's like air-fried). I'm only giving this place a 4 is because their flavours didn't come with a bang nor a kick (probably because they don't use a lot of MSG) and this is just personal preference + VERY BUSY on weekends. They don't take reservations so come here with group of 4 or less to guarantee yourself a table. If it's the weekend, you probably would have to wait 30+ minutes."}
{"text":"Went to MyMy Chicken with a few foodie friends and I really enjoyed my time there!  MyMy Chicken is another Korean Fried Chicken place near Yonge and Finch area.

Restaurant is quite large and they serve not only fried chicken, some Korean dishes are also available.  And you cannot have drinks without fried chicken, so this place has TONS of beer and Soju options.

A group of 4, we ordered the Garlic & Soy Sauce Chicken and the Green Onion Chicken.  Both portions were huge and their flavours were amazing!!  The Garlic & Soy Sauce actually comes with Korean Rice Cakes as well so it made it even better!  Between the two, I thought the Garlic and Soy Sauce had more flavours, but chickens are juicy in both!  For around $30 per dish, i think it is worth it consider how big the portions are.

Overall, I loved  what I had that night and considering this place specializes in Chicken, they did a heck of a job with it!! I highly recommend this place if you are in the area and are feeling for some Fried Chicken!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst fried chicken in my life ever! Both St. Louis and KFC are better than this! There is no flavor at all. Service is even worse than the food. The only pro is the decoration. Original chicken is plain. Cheese chicken is slightly better. The seasoned spicy flavor has a weird taste. All three flavors are lacking salt. Crispy is the only compliment I can make to these chicken."}
{"text":"Great place for hanging out in groups, first come first served, don't think they take reservations. Chicken was amazing, all other dishes were just o-k, the spicy rice cake was a little too sweet and sauce was a little too sick.  Service was average, a majority of korean restaurants have a call button on the table,so when pressed; servers will acknowledge to  assist you. Their honey garlic fried chicken has pieces of purple yam."}
{"text":"After a long week of work, my friend and I were in dire need of chimaek to reward ourselves. We arrived around 6:30pm on a Friday night and were promptly seated; the lines started forming half an hour later. Between the two of us, we shared half seasoned spicy and half golden cheese (boneless) along w/ a glass of Asahi beer. Pickled daikon, popcorn, and coleslaw were served as the sides. 

Our order came in two baskets that were mounted w/ chicken. Each piece had a good chunk of meat that was tender w/ a crispy skin. I liked how well it was fried as it wasn't greasy at all and went perfectly w/ the ice-cold beer. The seasoned spicy had a saucy coating that was more on the sweet side w/ a kick. The golden cheese had a layer of cheese powder & shredded cheese that made it more savory & crisp. Both were well executed, though I do prefer the seasoned spicy more. The latter was a bit dry in comparison. But I just ended up dipping it in the seasoned spicy sauce. 

The only thing I wish is for them to have more options for the half & half. I really wanted to try their soy & garlic one, but it wasn't one of the choices. All in all, I'll be back to try their other offerings."}
{"text":"I think fried chicken generally tastes pretty good, especially when it's covered in sauces etc... but this chicken was weirdly cut and just had a lot of big, dry pieces. The spicy rice cake was yummy tho!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to find this place because I was like omg this reminds me of korea! Good fried chicken and spicy rice cakes! I was so happy that I got to enjoy this treat in Toronto vs flying to Korea to eat this. I was craving this every since I got back from Korea a year ago. This place is really nice and clean. The funny thing is only really attractive waiters work here. I was low key intimated and was like why are there so many cute Korean boys here?! Anyways we ordered a take out Bc the wait would be a lil long even though the place is big. It was still hot when we got to the hotel and the smell just reeked of Korea (ahh I love it)! Every bit was amazing and when I come back to Toronto I want to go here again so good! The waiters all spoke Korean so it is good for those who are fluent in Korean and just visiting. 

Tip: get the combo!"}

{"text":"Best Korean fried chicken I've had in Toronto. Ordered take out but the ambiance reeled me in. Since their online menu was in Korean, we just asked for the most popular fried chicken for 2. Chicken was cooked just right and had great flavour. Sides compliment the chicken really well. They play good, upbeat music too. Definitely worth the price"}
{"text":"One of the popular Korean Fried Chicken places in North York.
Not only is the ambiance busy, but its slightly dim and cozy, in addition their service is fast and most of all friendly.
Parking is always a challenge in this part of the city, however it's easily accessible via Subway. 
Mymy's popularity is no surprise, there's always line ups here. 

In terms of menu, they've got a great selection of flavors for wings along with a great beer selection, after all, beer and Chicken goes hand-in-hand.

**Pitcher of Asahi Japanese Beer $22. 
**Yam fries - was good, but could have opted out for them.
**Spicy Chili pepper - this was okay, not the best choice though. my mistake.
**Green Onion - the best out of the two, had a lovely sauce to compliment the dish, along with the green onions. 

Their portions are huge and one order can easily be for 2-3 people.  They've also got a great selection of flavors along with mix flavor orders, limited to certain flavors. 
I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This place was not bad.  Prices were average compared to other Korean chicken places.  The servings I feel would feed 4 people.  Ordered the spicy rice cakes and really loved those.  Also ordered the French fried which were nice and crispy.  Decided to order the half and half so that we could try 2 flavours, ended up choosing cheese and seasoned spicy.  Both were not bad but a little dry.  I would definitely go again the only thing is the line up!!!"}
{"text":"Luckily, there was no wait when we got here, but after we sat down, a bunch of people came in so everyone else who came in after us had to wait a while for seats.

The chicken here is sooo good. We got the half spicy and half gold cheese chicken order and oh my gosh, YUM. They were so crispy on the outside, soft and juicy on the inside... the gold cheese chicken is amazing when it is piping hot. The spicy chicken + pickled side dishes were a nice contrast to the super light, cheesy goodness of the gold cheese chicken. Everything was so delicious.

I think the portion size was pretty good, there were two of us and we had a few pieces left over even after forcing ourselves to eat more. We also had a pitcher of beer, and were pleasantly surprised that it was not watered down. Honestly I think this is pretty reasonably priced considering the quality of it and price of Korean Fried Chicken everywhere else. Plus, Mymy Chicken is definitely tastier than some of the other KFC places around!

Service is pretty good, our waters and other miscellaneous needs were always met quickly and aptly. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I watched this place go through renos to the grand opening! I finally got a chance to try it and the chicken is very juicy and crispy. I also ordered the spicy rice cake with cheese.Portions are big, but so was the bill. I do like the service here better than nearby fried chicken joints. There are also lots of tables. If you are coming during prime dinner time, arrive early or be prepared to wait. 

If I was to make a suggestion, it would be be to offer tea when you are seated. My mom doesn't drink anything except for hot water and tea, but then again she isn't the targeted clientele. It's nice not to have to ask for water. 

Also, more menus and English translation on the combos.

Looking forward to try other chicken flavours!"}
{"text":"Mymy chicken is the place to go for Korean fried chicken if you are in the North York area.

I got an order of green onion chicken, seasoned cream cheese chicken and spicy rice cakes to go. I like how the sauce and green onions for the green onion chicken was packaged individually; kept the crispy skin of the fried chicken.

Do not underestimate the portion size. After stuffing our faces (3 of us) we still had plenty of fried chicken to last another meal! (Order wisely ...) 

The place gets packed quite quickly. Went to pick up my order around 7pm and the place was already packed with an ample amount of people waiting for seats."}
{"text":"I went here with my friend wanting to try Korean Fried Chicken for the first time. We ordered tteokbokki and corn cheese for appetizers. The corn cheese was amazing, it wasn't what I imagined cheese would taste like. It was creamy and good. They also you give some side dishes too! 
We also ordered the half and half, Original and Seasoned Spicy. The original was so crispy and hot. Definitely my favorite. Whereas the seasoned spicy wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be. It has more of a sweet flavor. The prices are a bit more expensive for fried chicken but definitely worth it. The half and half was good for the both of us."}
{"text":"Sorry I really wanted to like this place.

But everything had such a heavy taste and it felt very deep fried, and not in the good way. The golden cheese one tasted very artificial. Like eating cheese powder chemicals. Same with the spicy and sweet one, just coated and soaking in with thick sweet sauce. I couldn't eat much at all. 

The fries are good though. +1 star for the fries and +1 for the awesome service."}
{"text":"I've been to The Fry and Home of Hot Taste prior to coming to this restaurant and finally got a chance to come here since many people have been raving about this place. I came on a Monday night and it wasn't too busy. After being seated, we decided on our order and we were served a basket of shrimp rice chips, picked radish, and coleslaw (on the house). I got to try the Half-Half with Garlic/Soy and Gold Cheese ($29). The Garlic/Soy flavor was savory and flavored evenly. The Gold Cheese looked better than it tasted. The chicken came out dry and it was not as cheesy/flavorful as I had imagined. Overall, it wasn't bad but it was not amazing either."}
{"text":"Hands down, I think after coming to Mymy for the first time, I can confidently say that it's the best korean fried chicken restaurant in the area.

My service was really great. His name was Jae and he was so helpful with my group of friends. He gave us multiple servings of banchan when we asked and he was attentive to our specific needs.

We ordered the green onion fried chicken, garlic and soy sauce fried chicken and sweet potato fries. I was a bit surprised to find wasabi with the green onion, but it was still very delicious to eat. The garlic and soy sauce also comes with pieces of rice cake, and I would suggest asking for a fork to eat this dish. All the dishes have very unique flavours and it is that reason why I would definitely come back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I'm really liking the explosion of Korean Fried chicken places. The vibe and the service in this place was excellent. Way better service than the Fry which was borderline terrible. Really enjoyed the free popcorn, pickled cabbage, and pickled daikon. The onion rings were tasty and a massive portion.

We got the half half gold cheese and seasoned spicy chicken. The individual pieces were huge.

The gold cheese was not bad. The cheesy flavour didn't stand out too much for me but overall the meat was moist and skin crispy, but I feel like it could have been cheesier, though that may not be authentic.

The seasoned spicy is my go-to flavour for KFC and it was crispy, saucy and mildly spicy. The heat level was easily manageable. The meat was a little less moist than the gold cheese but overall I enjoyed it.

Overall, I think this is a great place to meet up after work and chill and eat some comfort food."}
{"text":"First time having korean fried chicken in TO. I came here last friday around 8pm - and the wait was an hour..so we left. This Friday at 9pm - we got a table almost right away. It's a dark place, they play loud hip hop, and loud chatter -- not suitable for kids. Ordered the half/half - golden cheese + spicy chicken and pitcher of Heineken. We werent super hungry...and when the food came out...it was way too much food for 2 people. But it's all good - you can pack it home. I personally like the spicy chicken better than the golden cheese. Its not really spicy - its a sweet korean bbq sauce. The golden cheese has a lighter, dry flavour. Overall, good crisp, moist, and piping hot. Came with complimentary popcorn and pink pickled cabbage with some mayo drizzled over. The mayo was kind of weird...it kind of clashed with the sweet/tangy pickle juice.

Beer came in frosted glasses! Extra hold, clean, crisp taste.

Would def recommend to others and come back."}
{"text":"Waited 1 hour on Friday night around 6:30pm for a table of 3. 

This place is Korea's equivalent to North America's pub - fried chicken, beer & loud music. Good place to chill with friends. 

For 3, we shared: 
- Cream Cheese Chicken - the skin is not the crispiest, but the meat is juicy (esp the drumstick). Love the sauce. 
- Yam fries - good
- Oden Soup - good. A light, clear broth with peppery taste. Usually not a fan of fish cake/ball, but the fish ball was very bouncy! 
- Kloud Korean beer - a very light beer

Total was around $20pp with some leftover chicken. Def a nice spot to check out in the area - make sure to come early!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the side dishes they gave us to munch on as we waited for the food, which consisted of pickled radish, pickled onions and POPCORN. For some reason, I found the taste of the radishes to blend really well with the taste of popcorn (okay this may just me me though... don't blame me if you get sick). 

As for the chicken, I ordered cheese and spicy half and half. I really liked the cheese one! Tasted like the ones I had in Korea. As for the spicy one I didn't taste the spice at all; wish they made it more hot. The only thing I'll mention is that I found the chicken to be a bit dry, and some of the pieces were a bit tasteless. Just a BIT so it didn't really matter that much to me.

I also didn't find the price to be that bad, either. I mean they serve you a whole chicken...  Was pretty worth it I think."}
{"text":"Came here around 8pm with my hubby. Was seated right by the door. Server brought our menus right away, came when we wanted to order and the banchan was dropped literally 2 minutes after our order was placed, we did request for water but that took a really, really long time to come, as the server blatantly ignored us to go seat our patrons waiting by the entrance. Then our order was done but again servers ignored it so one of the cooks ended up bringing out our chicken. Poor guy, it was clearly annoyed. I honestly heard the service bell in the kitchen dinging so much because he wanted to make sure our food came out not cold. Overall, taste wise, it was mediocre compared to Ajuker or The Fry, might go back if both of those places are super crowded."}
{"text":"Popped by yesterday night at 7pm and they had a wait at the door. No reservation policy. We mentioned the number of people within our party and were really lucky to be seated. Woohoo!
They have a simple menu focused on fried chicken and they do it well. We ordered their original flavour and sweet and spicy flavour. Both were delicious - crispy skin, juicy inside and large portions. We also ordered a cast iron skillet with more chicken. This sauce was much spicier - if you like it hot, they can accommodate. They also offered side dishes of pickled reddish and cabbage. You can also order other dishes such as seafood pancake, noodles and rice cakes. I would recommend that as I felt we had too much chicken and not enough variety. Service was quick and friendly. They have a call button which makes life easy. A great space for large groups & a great late night eat option."}
{"text":"Amazingly crunchy chicken wings with great flavours! Got the goat cheese and the sauce with peanuts! You get more for your portion if you get French fries as supposed to the onion rings and the sweet potato fries. If you're a fan of spicy, ask for the hot sauce! It will cost you extra but it is extremely worth it! Viscous, hot and sweet and flavourful! I would totally go here again and try a full chicken!"}
{"text":"I have always loved fried chicken, from I was a little kid. The KFC that I grew up with was The Colonel's secret recipe but this KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) is nothing like that. This is crispier and lighter without being greasy at all, maybe due to the double-frying process. It's also available with different flavours (assorted sauces or cheese).

On this occasion, we ordered half with cheese and the other half with a spicy red sauce that was more sweet than spicy. Both were delicious, although my companion was disappointed that the Fire Hot sauce was no longer available. Thank goodness! I'm getting less and less tolerant for spicy hot food.

I've never had cheese on my fried chicken before but I have to say, I enjoyed it a lot, maybe more than the sauced one because it was super crispy. I took some home and it was just as crispy the next day.

The sauced one was equally delicious and almost as crispy. It would be hard to choose between them so I guess we'll be ordering half and half every time!

Complimentary side dishes included pickled cabbage, pickled radishes, and popcorn. They were okay but I could have had some bread, fries, or rice, even some kind of green salad. Next time..."}
{"text":"We got the original and honey garlic and both were ok. Chicken was juicy but nothing special about it. Downside is they don't have a wings option. Limited sides as well."}
{"text":"We ordered the half and half of Gold Cheese and Seasoned Spicy ($28) along with an order of Rice Cakes ($10). This was more than enough food for 2 people, but nonetheless, we crushed it. 

Unlike other chicken places, the menu didn't say how much chicken came with each order or how many people each order was meant to serve. We  later found that 1 order of chicken meant a full chicken. It isn't only wings. Each half of chicken had about 8 pieces. 

The Gold Cheese was similar to KFC, but with cheddar and more crispy. The Seasoned Spicy was more sweet than spicy, and was nice and flavourful. I liked alternating between the two flavours as there was a nice contrast between the two. I preferred the seasoned spicy over the gold cheese. 

The rice cakes were soft, chewy, and spicy. A lot of places have harder rice cakes, but not here. 

In all, the chicken was great, and I would definitely recommend the seasoned spicy flavour. I would come back if I ever have fried chicken cravings."}
{"text":"First time here on Friday night, my boyfriend and I waited about 20 minutes. The restaurant is small so if you do decide to check it out, please note there might be a bit of a wait. Parking is street parking but it's free after 9pm. 

We ordered the following: 
* Half and Half [Gold Cheese and Spicy Chicken] 
* Spicy Ddubboki with cheese [+$3.00 for cheese]
* Pitcher of Canadian 

There was complimentary popcorn, pickled radish and cabbage that came with our food. This was a good combination with the fried chicken, I wish they had kimchi too. 

The Gold Cheese Chicken was very delicious, batter was tasty but light. It has good flavours and with the cheese it tastes even better. The Spicy Chicken was more sweet than spicy in my opinion. My boyfriend and I both preferred the Gold Cheese Chicken over the Spicy. 

The Spicy Ddubboki was a good portion and had just the right amount of spice. It came with a boiled egg and fish cakes as well. As a fan of ddubboki, it did not disappoint; the rice cakes were cooked just right and had a chewy texture. 

Overall, I was impressed with the fried chicken here. Even though there are a lot of KFC places around, I wouldn't mind coming back to try their other options on the menu."}
{"text":"The environment is casual and there was a lot of people at night! Their fried chicken was really good and love the sauce for their seasoned spicy chicken :)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a diffrent type of wings night and care to try a diffrent take on chicken, let me tell you - Koreans sure know how to do their chicken (you get the option of either half or a full chicken that is cut up and fried and chose from their selection of sauces/seasoning). 

The Gold Cheese and Seasoned Spicy is what my friends and I ordered, and was reccomend by a friend that had gone there before. You know how most wing places would be drenched in sauce that the chicken would become soggy?... well not at this place, the chicken remained crisp with the perfect amount of sauce/seasoning! Aside from wings we got tteokbokki (spicy Korean rice cakes) which came along with fish cakes and an egg (you can add add-ons into it - we added fried seaweed cakes!) and yam fries (that came with a spicy mayo dip) to share, along with drinking Makgulli (a well know rice based alcoholic Korean drink) to make the meal enjoyable. 

It got a bit packed as it got later (7pmish) but service was kept well whenever we asked for refills on the appetizers or more water. The ambiance and music that was played was perfect for a Saturday night out. An awesome place for Korean fried chicken and I'd say it's better than The Fry."}
{"text":"Good place for Korean fried chicken. Lineups are long during peak hours (weekends, evenings).  If you live near by, it's best to get takeout! We got takeout and the chicken was still crispy and tasty after our 3 minute drive home.  We got the seasoned spicy and onion half and half chicken, as well as the spicy rice cakes. The onion chicken was essentially four small onion rings on top of the original chicken. Maybe there was some onion powder on top? Not sure. Flavours are also limited for half and half chicken, and their menu on Facebook (as of today) was out-dated and some of the prices have changed too.

Overall, not sure I'd come back right away, as there are just too many similar Korean fried chicken places around with more menu/flavour options.  Their spicy rice cake dish was okay as well, creamier than what I've tried in the past.

If you're looking to get takeout, give yourself 30 minutes for the pickup (even if they say 20)."}
{"text":"One of the best fried chicken in town. Mymy chicken is a Korean restaurant that serves Korean style fried chicken as well as your traditional Korean dishes. I would recommend coming here with a big group because the portions are quite huge and it's nice to try different flavors. Overall the best Korean fried chicken I've tried in Toronto."}

{"text":"Korean fried chicken with a glass or two of beer is a good mix for catching up with friends!
 
I've been meaning to try this new location since it's a neighborhood I frequent for dinner with friends. 

On my first visit, we ordered 2 flavours combo: gold cheese and garlic/soy. On my second visit, 3 nights later, we ordered the 3 flavours combo: gold cheese, honey & garlic, seasoned spicy. 

The flavours are nicely balanced, however the chicken comes out slightly dry - which is a bit disappointing. I'll probably still go back to this place because of its location, but I hope they do something about injecting some juice in their chicken."}
{"text":"After going to a bunch of Korean fried chicken places that have alright, I decided to read up some comment on posts and see where people were recommending; I was told to come here. This place has been my favourite Korean fried chicken place since this other place by Patricia Ave. & Yonge St. closed down a while back.

I usually come here with 3-4 people and share a half & half boneless chicken (Seasoned Spicy & Onion) and ddukbokki. It's seriously is so worth it. The spice here can get pretty spicy when you're eating it, but they have sides that will help soothe you. The three sides that they serve are popcorn, radish, and this purple radish like salad (I still don't know what it is, haha).

Give this place a try whenever you have the chance to, because it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Mymy chicken is my current go-to place for Korean fried chicken. They serve freshly fried segments from the whole chicken so you'll never know what piece you get. Once I got the entire length of the neck! There is a boneless option for $2, but for me, getting the meat off the bone is part of the experience. The chicken comes out super hot so be careful on that first bite! The outside is super crispy and inside is juicy and tender, fried to perfection. Even the ones coated with sauce has a good crispy texture beneath the gooey and flavorful topcoat. 

I personally like to get the half and half chicken with the original and another flavor for fun. In my opinion, the original is the best. The seasoned spicy is very sweet with perfect amount of kick, but it does have peanuts and I find that there is a slight oddness to the flavor that I can't quite identify. I would say getting one chicken is a very good amount for 2-3 people, depending on your appetite. It also comes with starters like pickled raddish, pickled cabbage, and popcorn.

This place gets very busy, so either come early or be prepared to wait. You can also order take-out for pick-up ahead of time to skip extra waiting."}
{"text":"Excellent Korean fried chicken place.  Ordered 5 different flavors of chicken,  and all tastes really good.  I also liked the rice roll even its a bit spicy for me.  Service is exceptionally good.  Place is just right for large group of family/friends."}
{"text":"The chicken is so good here! We got boneless for all 3 options; it's better than The Fry and the service is very friendly. We got to the restaurant a little late, around 11:30 on a Saturday and had to wait for a 4 person table for about an hour. Try to go early if possible, the space is pretty big but it gets really packed on weekends. 

We had the cheese, onion mix and spicy chicken. The spicy chicken is SPICYY; don't get it if you can't take spice. The original and cheese flavour went by so fast! Everyone at my table enjoyed it a lot. 

Would like to come back & have already recommended to friends."}
{"text":"Upon walking in we were entertained by the humerous meme posters about Korean cuisine/fried chicken/eating that lined the walls. 

After being seated we were immediately served a basket of cheese flavoured rice chips, picked radish, and coleslaw. 

We ordered the reccomended spicy chicken and golden cheese chicken combo, basic topokki, and a bottle of rice wine. They served the rice wine first and it came in metal bowls!!! Not sure if this is standard for drinking this type of alcohol but it was different for us... We asked for water when the food came.

The topokki was amoungst the most plain/simple looking I've had but it was satisfying to taste. Yummy! Loved the touch of fresh green onions instead of seaweed or sesame seeds. I found the price of $11 to be a little high for an average portion of the simple appetizer. They had many tempting add ons such as cheese, extra rice cakes, dumplings and more but it was $2.50 each!!! I don't think this could even be completely filling as a meal despite costing as much as one. 

Alternatively, the spicy chicken had a unique  flavour. It reminded me of a warm Christmas drink and it was addicting to eat. The chicken wasn't crispy since it was covered in a thick and sticky sauce. Despite being labelled as spicy, it was way too mild. The topokki was much more satisfyingly spicy. 

My friend and I had decided that the golden cheese chicken was the better fried chicken between the two even though we love spicy KFC!! Weve tried a lot of different places and eat it quite frequently. From other reviews, I was expecting the chicken to be a bit dry but I didn't experience that problem even with our boneless chicken. I'm not sure if it was on the menu, but boneless is $2 more JSYK. The cheese powder was interesting but I liked the  shredded cheese more. Honestly, I think the only separating feature between the golden cheese fried chicken and regular fried chicken topped with cheese is the cheese powder. Overall, everything paired well but I probably would not come again or crave anything from here. Nothing was BAD but nothing was amazing either. I'd rather just try something new next time I'm in the area but that's just me."}
{"text":"Wow! Super yummy and super unexpectedly crispy chicken, even after doing a takeout! I was expecting the chicken to be extremely greasy and soggy by the time we got in, after walking for about 10-15mins back to our friend's place. It was to our surprise, super flavourful and super crispy and light! We've ordered the green onion chicken and the soy sauce garlic chicken. It was some finger licking good Korean fried chicken! I highly recommend you to try them both."}
{"text":"DEVOURED: Half and half- seasoned spicy and gold cheese fried chicken ($28). Banchans (appetizers)- radish, some non-stale and actually hot salty popcorn, and Korean-style coleslaw ($0 and refillable). Chimaek isn't chimaek without the maekju- translation, pint of beer ($7).

EXTRAS: Waited 20 minutes on a Friday night. Large space bumpin' the latest Korean hits. Great vibe for a Friday night. Service was attentive considering how busy they were. 

VERDICT: I don't get the hype. Chicken was dry and the gold cheese variety seemed like an after thought with the cheddar cheese stuck onto the skin of the chicken. The seasoned spicy was more sweet than spicy and definitely for the mild spicy lovers. Batter was thinner than other KFC places, and was on a moderate crispy level. Banchans were solid, along with the coleslaw reminiscent of KFC restaurants in Korea was a nice touch, as most KFC places in Toronto do not have it as a side. Pint of beer, always 10/10. 

RETURNING OR NAW: Not my first, second, or third KFC option, but I would return to try their other offerings."}
{"text":"Mymy offers a cool yet casual place on Bloor Street to grab chicken. The restaurant is narrow and long with tables.The environment was lively and my party of 2 was still able to hear one another even though the tables were relatively close to one another.

I tried the half and half (for $29) of Gold Cheese and Seasoned Spicy chicken along with a side of fries. The chicken is plentiful and tasty. The seasoned spicy had just enough batter that did not overbear the taste of the chicken. While I was a little skeptical of the Gold Cheese, it made for a good complement to the season spicy. We had enough to take home for another meal. The fries were nothing special and I'd probably choose another side the next time.

Overall great value, service, and atmosphere. Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I love popeyes and Chinese KFC. Whever I try out a new fried chicken place, I always compare it to the two.

At mymy, you get a lot of food for how much you pay. The basket will be full of wings and drumsticks (and breasts i believe), not the tiny ones, and unfortunately not the huge popeyes ones, but decently sized ones.The flavours won't be your typical mild or spicy, you can get pretty adventurous and order the cheese flavour. 

With it being a legit restaurant, a sit down place, with a fairly high price tag (compared to fast food chains), I wasn't thrilled. The flavours are cool, but I didn't get that \"I cant stop eating\" feeling that I get with popeyes.

Place is super congested, and a bit icky. Don't wear your nice clothes and bags. The fried chicken are good, and creative with the flavours, but there are just way too many better options of fried chicken for a lower price point."}
{"text":"Mymychicken IS BLESSED.

This place is one of my go to places for some late night food after work, korean fried chicken. They give you popcorn and some purple sour cabbage as appetizers after you order which helps the oily ness of the chicken and fries. 

My favourite things to order here are the cream cheese chicken which makes me feel completely sluggish  after since it's basically cheese cream cheese and fried chicken BUT ITS SO BLESSED ya hear? You'll need to go on a mad cleanse after this and hit the gym every single day for a month before you can have this again. 

The honey garlic chicken which omg has these blessed deep fried doboki pieces in it, ugh it's so BLESSED fam. 

And last but not least the actual doboki itself. It has fishcakes, ONE egg, doboki, I think some veggies like onions, and well the sauce. 

These are the staple items you need to get. You honestly need the doboki because it compliments every other dish. You can't have it alone you gotta mix each and every one of these items together, you can't have it alone. It's like the powerpuff girls without bubbles, it just doesn't work. 

But once you have all 3 of these dishes, your tastebuds will feel the harmonization, you'll feel like all your clothes have been striped off, from the hotness of the doboki, to the creaminess of the cream cheese chicken, cooling the spices down and the honey garlic to sweeten and relax the flavour roller coaster you're embarking on. 

Mymychicken is BLESSED but you'll probably need to hit the gym after since you're probably gonna eat it all so gotta give it that 4 stars. 

Ohoh don't forget the yam fries, that's basically like  the plate for your food, can't eat food without a plate right?"}
{"text":"Went to Mymy chicken on Friday night. The restaurant was on a small side street. The restaurant was very crowded, but luckily we were able to get a table very quickly.

We ordered the half and half chicken which was half regular chicken and half spicy chicken. The fried chicken was very good, much better than KFC or Popeye chicken.

Would we go back? Yes because the food was very good and affordable."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place for having the best Korean fried chicken in the area and after seeing all the positive reviews on Yelp, we decided to try it out! We arrived around 7pm on a Wednesday and had to wait about 10 min. Shortly after though, there was a long line that formed so I guess it gets really busy around that time.

At first glance, the prices for the chicken seemed a bit high, but the portions are actually huge and filling. We went with the Half and Half - Gold Cheese and the Seasoned Spicy ($29), an order of fries ($6), and a bottle of Makgulli. We were expecting small pieces of chicken, but they were all large chunks of meat with a crispy, well-seasoned exterior. I personally preferred the Seasoned Spicy Chicken as there is a hint of sweetness to it. I would love to try all the other flavours but too bad the the choices for the Half and Half are limited. 

Ambience was nice, a bit dim and it can get a bit loud depending on the other customers near your table/ booth. The background music was also great and alternated between English and Korean songs. The service was also spot-on. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Really good fried chicken! Some pieces were dry, but still good nonetheless. The crunch and flavour here is great. I preferred the cheese fried chicken over the spicy fried chicken. I expected the spicy sauce to be more flavourful. Going to return to try the green onion flavour! The dukkbokki here is good too if you add cheese. It's a lot spicier than the spicy fried chicken."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was awesome.  Great atmosphere and fun experience.  Good choice anytime!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was quite full for a Monday evening. Many korean customers as it is supposed to have originated from South Korea.

We tried the half and half ($29 bone in for two flavours but only had 4-5 options to choose from). The seasoned spicy had the most flavourful sauce!! A good mixture of sweet, spicy and peanut-y. The skin was crispy at first but as you let it sit in the sauce, the last few pieces weren't as crispy.  The golden cheese was so crispy and yet so juicy! The cheese flavour wasn't strong but every once in a while you do get a subtle taste of it and it worked well.  

It came with 3 side dishes: popcorn, pickled radish and pickled cabbage. Personally not a fan of radish but the pickled cabbage definitely cut some of the greasiness that is fried chicken!"}
{"text":"The chicken is delicious!  My husband and I did the 1/2 and 1/2 and it was way too much food. The portion can be shared among 4 people. Therefore, if you do not want left overs don't order a basket to yourself instead share a basket. The chicken was very favorable. My only issue is the service was not the best. Got a dirty cup, server never refilled our water bottle and I also noticed their long hair touching other customer's the chicken as they were walking out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"I went there today. The cheese chicken tastes good. But two waitresses have poker face all the time, they only smile when they are chatting with each other.........so far this restaurant is on my \"go order, eat, pay and never come back\" list"}
{"text":"We always walk by this place and there are always lineups. We decided to try this place on a Sunday night to avoid the crowds. The food did not disappoint! Service was quick and they gave us some side dishes including some popcorn. The chicken was worth the wait. We decided to go for a half and half - half original and half seasoned spicy. The chicken was super juicy, the skin was crispy and light. The sauce was just the right amount of sweet and spicy. It was quite a lot of food and we actually had to get a doggy bag for the rest. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Oh my god, it was totally worth the money. Tasty and crunch. Wow I will go back soon."}
{"text":"Got the split combo with the spicy and sweet chicken and the cheese and original recipe.  Overall both were really good and up to par to the other Korean friend chicken places.  However they could probably put a bit more cheese on the chicken as i felt it was a bit sparse.  Given that it says cheese in the title I expected more.  The side dishes were good with kimchi and pickled vegetable with popcorn.  I however thought they could have given more variety.  Either way good overall.  I would say the only downside to the chicken is the batter was thicker and crunchier then I am used to for Korean fried chicken.  I would describe it more \"Kentucky fried chicken\" rather then the traditional Korean fried chicken where it is crispier and lighter in my opinion.  Overall pretty good would go back if i was in the area"}
{"text":"I ordered seasoned spicy, golden cheese, and green onion chicken. The food was nice. I'll say above average compared to other korean fried chicken places.

However, the waiter and waitress were rude to max. I cannot even understand why getting two extra beer cups is so hard for them since we ordered two pitchers of beer. For every request we had, they would not respond at once. We needed to tell them multiple times for small requests. All their facial expressions and tones and yeah.
I know this is pretty new in Toronto. I really suggest them to train their workers well."}
{"text":"My sister decided to have a simple birthday dinner with the cousins and I at Mymy Chicken.

There was 5 of us so we ordered the 3 flavour combo which was $43 (original, honey garlic, and golden cheese) and we managed to finish everything! The chicken was surprisingly juicy and filling. 

The \"golden cheese\" tasted more sweet than savoury & it reminded me of the cheese topping on a Filipino pastry called ensaymada which is a sweet bread with butter, sugar and cheese on top. The honey garlic didn't really taste like honey garlic to me but I still liked it. 

The service was really good; my cousin wanted lemon in her water and they actually gave it to her haha! 

This spot is great if you wanna catch up with friends over chicken and pitchers of beer."}
{"text":"We ordered a half and half with gold cheese and seasoned spicy as well as boiled sweet and spicy.

I personally don't like salty food but feel the chicken might be better with more salt/seasoning. The boiled one is crispier than the half half chickens, and I love the rice cake in the boiled chicken the most!

The radish side dish really helps with spicy chickens, and when we were doing take out for leftovers they even gave us a box of radish to go! 

Out of the 3 flavours I tried, would recommend gold cheese the most."}
{"text":"This place is newly opened and I was excited to try it as I've been going to the sheppard location religiously. I got their opening special which consists of 1 whole chicken fried and covered in one of their signature flavours + 1 pitcher of beer for $40. This place is by far better than the sheppard location and probably the best Korean fried chicken in the city, and I've tried them all so that's saying something. They also have cute waitresses so that's always a plus! Highly recommend their Gold Cheese flavour. Generous cheese toppings and gold cheese seasoning is SO DAMN GOOD."}
{"text":"Wow, I was expecting the fried chicken here to be really good, but I honestly think that the Fry serves up better Korean fried chicken. 

I'm really surprised that so many people enjoy this place and feel kind of bad posting this review, but this is just my opinion since I've had better.

We ordered the recommended fried chicken (onion fried + cheese fried) and were pretty disappointed upon tasting it. Some pieces we tried were really dry and the portion size is not as large as the fry's green onion boneless chicken for $30.

I'm guessing that they don't only use thigh pieces for deep frying and use some breast, which doesn't taste as good fried unless it's done really well (wasn't the case here).

We ordered some sauce to see if it would help with the dryness of the chicken, and it didn't. 

The sides were okay, but I still prefer the cole slaw, salad, and radishes from the Fry more. 

There is even a better Korean fried chicken place by Soban Cafe. I don't know, I guess I'm just really disappointed haha. 

Would not come here again for Korean fried chicken."}
{"text":"Appropriate restaurant name, because while eating here on a Thursday night with others, I really wanted it all to be Mymy Chicken.

I normally get boneless chicken just for the sake of convenience but because we had to pay extra for it, we got the chicken with the bones intact. It's definitely something I'll do more often, especially here, because the chicken was so juicy. We got the half and half and chose 'Seasoned' (rather, 'Sesoned' in their menus) and the 'Cheese' options. While I'm very picky with cheese, the seasoned one was just the right amount of sweetness with a small kick of spice.

The onion rings here were really nice and crispy too.

Mymy Chicken has a good variety of banchan as well: pickled radish, coleslaw, and popcorn. Good things to have to help cut the grease.

While I don't love the location for its traffic and lack of parking spots, it's a nice addition to your list of chicken joints."}
{"text":"Like other reviewers here have expressed, The Fry has effectively been replaced by this place as the go-to place to satisfy any KFC craving. My group ordered the spicy (warning to those with allergies, this dish contains peanuts), gold cheese, and green onion varieties of fried chicken. Pickled daikon, popcorn, and a simple slaw were the sides that came with it and nicely offset the potentially overwhelming greasiness that comes with eating KFC (though, on this point, I kind of miss the mayo corn on cast iron griddle from The Fry). Overall, the meat was moist and tender while the batter adequately crisp, with restraint--- a good balance. The green onion chicken I would say is on par with The Fry's, but a touch saucier. The gold cheese is an interesting new thing for me, tasted almost like they caramelized cheese into the batter. The spicy brings on some respectable heat and perfectly complements a pitcher of ice cold Asahi. I look forward to trying the other flavours when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"I was in the area and was craving fried chicken, so this was the place to go. I ordered the half and half (golden chicken and the onion fried chicken). The golden chicken was pretty tasty and the batter was not too thick. The onion fried chicken came with a couple of onion rings which was an added bonus. There is a good onion flavour which could be off putting for others, but I really enjoyed it. It was a little spicy but still tolerable. 

The only down side was the appetizers which was the popcorn (stale and no butter), the pickle Dikon was okay.

4/5 rating"}
{"text":"oh my. Chicken is good enough to give Guy Fieri an aneurism. Smokey, crispy, succulent, sweet and spicy OR crispy and cheesy *drool emoji*. Quality inputs. 
Blaring important trap, obscure Jamey Bay and Alessia Cara. Let's go get it. Nice appies, thoughtful and charming bathrooms. Clever service."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm My first time @ MY MY chicken last night, I was super impressed 
Our waiter was super handsome and friendly as well lol . 
The batter used on the chicken is super delicious and chicken is also tender n juicy mmmmmm can't wait to go back xoxoxo."}
{"text":"The hip yet casual spot in town for some Korean Fried Chicken.

Half-Half with Gold Cheese and Seasoned Spicy, $29. The chicken was cooked well however neither of the flavours really impressed me. The Seasoned Spicy flavour was too sweet and too drenched in sauce; the Gold Cheese also had an odd sweetness to it.

Toppoki, $11 with seaweed roll +$2.5 (I liked this add-on). Pretty average spicy rice cake and the additional charge per topping was a turn-off.

Steam Whistle pitcher (draft), $20. Reasonable price.

Okay spot to grab a beer with friends and munch on some KFC. Portions are good but don't expect to be wowed by the flavours."}
{"text":"This place only sell fired chicken, but it is so good.

The price is around $28 for the whole chicken.  it's alot of piece, one order can fill 2-3 people. 
Sauce wasnt too heavy and the chicken still so crispy.

Ordered 2 chicken for 4 people, around$16 per person and everyone is sooo full. It is very filing"}
{"text":"I can never get enough of Korean fried chicken! Came here on a random weekday for dinner but the wait was pretty long. I only managed to try the soy and garlic flavour which was good but I didn't find it any better than the other KFC places in the area. I expected it to be better because of the consistent loI will be back to try the green onion flavour. They have some combos where you can get half of one flavour and half of another, but not all flavours are included."}
{"text":"A really enjoyable and authentic Korean Fried Chicken experience at Mymy Chicken. 

All you really need to order is Fried Chicken and I was not disappointed!

4 of us shared:

Fire Hot Chicken ($28)
Half and Half ($28) : Original and Gold Cheese

Warning the Fire Hot is HOT and SPICY! And I just love how light the batter is and the meat just so moist! My lips though were burning! Deep fried rice cakes that came with the order tasted so good with the hot sauce! 

Probably one of favourite KFC joints in town. They ordered their custom fryers and ingredients from Korean. This is probably as close to eating fried chicken in Korea without flying there.

Too bad there are no smaller order for single diner, if not I would be there more often to indulge myself. But for the time being, I guess I have to invite my friends to share."}
{"text":"Pretty good chicken. I got the original and the spicy flavours. It took us 20 minutes to get home but the chicken was still soooo crispy. I wish they served bigger pieces though. I wanted more!! These things are so addictive. Would love to come back and actually sit and eat. Decor looks great. And it looks like a great place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Definitely my new go-to place for Korean fried chicken. Had the green onion chicken which, in my opinion, tasted better than at The Fry. Surprisingly, the cream cheese chicken was the star of the night. It was delicious. I have to admit that I was a bit hesitant to try it, but it tasted great--I couldn't get enough of it. 

I wish there were more options when ordering half/whole portions, but that doesn't stop me from coming back. Loved this place and I would highly recommend it. 

On a sidenote, if you're going during dinner time on a weekend, be ready for a wait. I've ordered to-go before and it tasted just as great. But if you're the type that likes to dine in, I would say it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is definitely my fav Korean fried chicken place. The first time I went it was with a group of 9, we waited a little before sitting, but they accommodated our size and the service was fabulous. Since then I've been to mymy chicken to solve all my fried chicken cravings. 

My fav is definitely the seasoned spicy, a close second would be the curry chicken. It sound weird at first, but trust me you wont be disappointed. The golden cheese is good too, but just not my cup tea. The batter is super crispy and flavourful, not too oily; and the inside is super juicy. 

I 100% recommend this place to try out if youre in the yonge and sheppard area! Get the half and half for the most variety :)"}
{"text":"First time at this place. Korean fried chicken is their specialty and they do it well. A bit expensive but you get large portions. Great for large/small groups. But not recommended for family or date night as it's more a bar feel and music is loud."}
{"text":"Sigh. 

I ordered the half/half spicy & green onion wings. The spicy wings were definitely SPICY and also a little (?) cinnamon-y (?)... the garlic wings are just basically regular deep fried wings with a dusting of sour cream and onion. I hate the sour cream and onion flavour with a passion so obviously I did not like these wings. Also ordered regular fries, which were good and came in a huge portion.

I had high hopes for this place but sadly out of the 2 flavours I tried, I did not like either of them :( from now on I will stick to Popeyes/kfc for fried chicken. 

Btw, came on a weekday night around 8:30pm- parking was ridiculously hard to find, and wait time was 30+ min"}
{"text":"This place looks pretty modern inside and out. We got complimentary popcorn as we waited for our take out order - half spicy and half regular platter of chicken. I was a bit disappointed with the food. The meat tasted drier than most other KFC places I've tried. The original reminded me of Popeye's. The spicy version was better because the sauce at least offsets the dryness. I'd opt for more saucy KFC next time."}
{"text":"I went here last night with a friend at around 8:20 and finally got seated at around 9 cause it was so busy. Our drinks and fries came fairly fast but my green onion fried chicken was not in sight after over 1 hour. I then finally asked a server about the status of my order and after going to check, they said it was coming. It finally came out 10 minutes later but it was not green onion chicken like I had order, it was just regular boneless. I advised the person that I had ordered green onion chicken and was expecting them to just bring it back in to put that onions and sauce over it but that did not happen. Another 15 minutes later, I got fed up and asked another server if I could just cancel my order and told him about what happened.

I'm giving this 2 stars because who I think was the manager apologized to us and waived our drinks and fries. Sadly, I did not get to try any chicken which I was really looking forward to because I've heard really good things about this place. The overall reviews are positive so I will give this place another shot on a less busy day where there is a less likely chance for this to happen again."}
{"text":"Expect ridiculously long wait times between getting seated, getting your order taken, and especially when waiting for the food. My friends and I probably spent more time waiting than actually eating.
 
We ordered 2 \"Three of a Kind\" chickens so a total of 6 different flavours and half of them came out overcooked. There was a burnt taste in the batter. At that point I would have rather gone to Popeyes because even they don't burn fried chicken. We also ordered onion rings which never came so when we asked them about it, they just forgot we even ordered them. When they finally brought them out, the onion rings had way too much seasoning on them and were extremely salty to the point where it was difficult for the four of us to finish it.

Inexperienced cooks that somehow burn fried chicken and screw up onion rings and poor customer service where items are just forgotten about. If you're in the mood for korean fried chicken then you might as well go to The Fry instead or if you really want Mymy Chicken then go to the one in North York."}
{"text":"I went to Mymy Chicken with my husband and son, we all enjoyed their delicious chicken. We got the Cheese and Onion flavours. We prefer the Cheese one. But the Onion one was good too.
Both me and my husband wanted to try their spicy chicken but considering our son we did not order that. Next time when we drop by we might get spicy ones."}
{"text":"Impressed by their chicken. It was good and when you compare it with fast food chains like kfc or even Popeyes's (which I love), you know how fresh and delicious their chicken is.  

They have 6 different flavours and I ordered the original.

Chicken came with 15 pieces, each lightly battered and seasoned perfectly. 

Chicken wasn't as huge but enough for 2 people, 3 at most.

Service was quick and love the atmosphere. 

This is now one of my spots to go chill."}
{"text":"For my 100th review.. it will be a KFC (korean fried chicken) joint BECAUSE I LUV FRIED CHICKEN. I've heard of this place and I really wanted to try it so we were by the area and came by for dinner on Sat night. WAS BUSY. There's a sign where you can't reserve seats.. we waited for maybe 35 minutes and we were a party of 3. Inside of the restaurant is kinda dark too which is unusual for an asian place. They serve mini pre apps and popcorn before you order your meal!

There's a lotta things on the menu. I find that the rice cakes are at a really good price. For $10 theres A LOT of rice cakes. Other places I ordered it at.. there aren't that many pieces lol. Each add on is additional $3. We added cheese which helped with the spiciness. 

Price points for chicken is comparable to any other places. They have this double up deal where you can get 2 dishes of chicken for $29. Portions for each are pretty big too and that filled 3 people. Only downside is that it doesn't include the green onion fried chicken (which was the one I really wanted to try). The chicken is super tender and juicy with lots of flavour. We got the gold cheese and the spicy bone-in and my favourite was the gold cheese.

Def will be coming back. Green onion fried chicken is still on my list!"}
{"text":"TL;DR: Great food! Sassy service...?

Went around 4 or 5 on a Tuesday evening, no wait. Definitely started to fill up around 6 though. Got the seasoned spicy chicken and was definitely a LOT of food for 2 people, well worth the price. Waited about 10-15 minutes for our meal, got radishes, popcorn and a sort of Korean coleslaw as sides almost immediately after we ordered. The chicken was a great texture, still crispy even thought it was smothered in a sweet-spicy sauce. I could eat them with chopsticks and my friend used her hands as there were some pieces with lots of bone, and some with nearly none. Ate so much and still had some to take home as leftovers. 

Took off a star because I wanted to do half-orders, which the lady abruptly claimed they \"don't do\" anymore, and I wasn't 100% fond of the sweet-spicy chicken, even though the menu claimed it was spicy. Another guy waiter was much nicer to us in regards to answering questions, however.

Now, another star comes off because service here is simply attained by pressing a button on the table. It's nothing amazing, the waiters didn't come by and check on us or offer extra side dishes when we ran out or any drinks/water. I only tip when service goes above and beyond (don't start on me please, I've worked retail and basically do the same job as waitstaff and never got commission/tips; bosses are supposed to make up for wages if the waitstaff doesn't make minimum wage in tips per shift, etc.) 
When I was paying my bill, the (same lady as before) who took my card had the AUDACITY to tell me, \"You're from Canada, here you must tip.\" I explained to her that I only tipped if service was exceptional, which it wasn't, and she said next time I come, I should tip?! Before this, she had practically ripped the card machine out of my friend's hand as she put her card in. 

The food was very good but honestly when she said that, it just put a bad taste in my mouth. I would rather not go to a restaurant if they constantly expect you to tip when they aren't doing an amazing job."}
{"text":"Rating: 5/5
Aesthetics: 3.5/5
Food: 5/5
Service: 5/5
Recommendation: Garlic & Soy Chicken (don't get fooled by the non-split option, this flavour is amazing and worth not being split) 

As a bonus: Spicy Rice Cakes with dumplings and seaweed rolls!

Insta tip: Get a lower angle looking up to the towering fried chicken then get the the glisten and sharpness of the crispyness that Mymy Chicken masterfully creates!

Overall: An amazing fried chicken place to indulge and satisfy the greatest of cravings! Come with an appetite and then some because there is A LOT of chicken here! However, be prepared to wait because the hype sure is real for this new chicken joint around North York. Share different flavors and enjoy yourself!

Drown yourself in some amazing fried chicken at this new restaurant! Their chicken has a perfect blend between crispy, moist, and flavorful. Probably the best fried chicken I've had in Toronto. We opted for the Garlic & Soy flavour and was not disappointed with the portions or the flavour. Although it wasn't available for a half-half basket option, it was better as a whole serving. 

The spicy rice cakes are also a great side to having some fried chicken. The rice cakes have a little bit of a kick but alongside the seaweed rolls and dumplings, there is no better combination except for beer. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I had the chance to try out this location and I'd say this one was a lot better than the uptown location on Yonge. The waitress was very accommodating and she seemed like she knew the menu fairly well, unlike my recent take out order. I really like that the menu had nut allergy labelled for their chicken dishes and she was nice enough to tell us that certain sauces we got as dip contained nuts. There were a few new fried chicken that wasn't on the uptown menu and we had the pleasure to trying them out. These included the traditional and the gold cheese with cream sauce. Both were interesting (the traditional was a bit dry but the outer layer was crispier than the original and the cream sauce had an awkward sourness to it that I didn't like) but I'd rather just go with the original and gold cheese. 

We did a three way combo so out chicken dishes came out in smaller proportions but was a decent size for the 7 of us. Maybe a few of my male friends could eat more so I'd still order 3 separate chicken plates for those wanting more out of it. 

Overall, it's not somewhere I'd return just for fried chicken since there are many other places around but it wasn't a bad experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic Korean fried chicken with generous portions, friendly staff, and unique artwork. Ordered the 3-flavor combo (good for 4 people) and chose the gold cheese, honey garlic, and sweet & spicy flavors. The honey garlic and sweet and spicy were good but the gold cheese was my favorite. I'd highly recommend ordering that flavor at least! Meanwhile, also ordered the cheese corn which was a delicious appetizer."}
{"text":"Best Korean fried chicken in the area by a landslide. I normally have to go to The Fry on Yonge to get KFC, but decided to try this place out. 

Absolutely incredible service, first of all. Not like the stoic faces and placid waitstaff that you see at The Fry. The wait staff at Mymy are extremely attentive, care about your selections, and are very polite. I believe I briefly spoke to the owners (a lovely Korean woman and a Korean man) and they were incredibly kind and helpful, and you can tell that they stand by their food and service. The interior is spacious and the music is upbeat. It feels like a great place to hang out with a date or with a group of friends. 

I ordered a half half fried cheese and spicy chicken with fried rice cakes for take out, and they gave me pop corn while I waited. They don't have a takeout menu yet but they will take call orders. 

Chicken was so moist and juicy, the fry coating was flavourful and light, not greasy at all. Absolutely fantastic. Also, they give you good meaty pieces, not weird bone and neck pieces like I remember from The Fry. Also, the spicy chicken flavor balance is just right- not too spicy, not too sweet so that you can actually taste the chicken. The fried rice cake was very interesting- crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside. I think it's a great match for the chicken, especially the spicy chicken. I highly recommend getting their coleslaw with your order. EXCELLENT. 

Again, best KFC that I've tried by far. This will be my go-to chicken place from now on. Yes the price is a little higher than others but I think for the service, the quality, and the taste it is WELL WORTH THE MONEY. Cannot emphasize how much I love this place and how excited I am to go back again. Great addition to the neighbourhood."}
