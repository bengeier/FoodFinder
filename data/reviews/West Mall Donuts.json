{"text":"Huge Apple Danishes! Unfortunatley huge doesnt mean better. 
So what does Westmall Donuts have to offer? Here you can eat a fattening overpriced danish in a horribly old and decrepid space and wash it all down with a lousy tasting coffee.
Do yourself and your wallet a favour and avoid it!"}
{"text":"This place is mostly for locals around the plaza -- and I'm a local.

Little cafe/restaurant, family run, with many options for breakfast and lunch, apart from the obvious coffee and donuts. I recommend the big breakfast, for $5, which comes with 3 eggs, sausages/bacon, toast, homefries, and a free coffee.

BLT and club sandwiches are good too. Everything's made fresh at the back.

Good spot for a quick lunch stop.

{"text":"This place is a local neighbourhood spot. The coffee is decent, not better then tims of course lol,  and their eclairs and danishes are freakin awesome. Their breakfast sandwiches are sooo tasty and same with the breakfast meals. I know the danishes are homemade because my father is a regular there lol
The outside sidewalk is now clean, I hear they have powerwashed it which is just fantastic. Weirdos tend to flock to this place at night"}
{"text":"I stopped into West Mall Donuts one morning on my way to work as I was really hungry and craving a western sandwich. It's definitely more of a diner vibe than a donut shop; albeit, they do have an assortment of donuts. They also have samosas, Jamaican patties, sausage rolls and pre-made sandwiches if you want to be in and out in a hurry.

The d√©cor is your basic diner but it was clean. Service was friendly but they really took their time taking my order. Anyway, the western sandwich came to $5.00 but it was kind of on the thin side. It did, however, have adequate ham, peppers and onions. I'm just used to thicker, fluffier westerns but no real complaint because it tasted alright. I'd definitely consider stopping in again."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely sketchy. Which is sad, because they do cool things for the community like sponsor baseball/t-ball teams and the like, but it attracts a strange crowd and I'm not sure why. It might be the sterile/unwelcoming aesthetic, or the cheapness of the prices. It's more of a 'get in and get out' kind of place than a 'I want to chill here for a while' or 'meet up with a friend' kind of coffee place. 

As far as quality goes, I would put it on par with Tim Horton's. It's decent and cheap. Having said that, with the new Rabba's, I'd rather go there for coffee/meetups."}
{"text":"I go here all the time, the store has an oldish coffee time feel along with a lot of trashy customers. I like their sausage rolls, Jamaican patties, fries, brownies, muffins and donuts. I'm going to give it 4 stars based on convenience and for the few things I like about west mall donuts. 

They don't offer much of a selection at a time because they only make 1 or 2 of each donut or muffin for some reason .. And they have the option to buy 6 or a dozen which I don't see how it will work.

I tried the tea biscuits twice (to see if it was a bad batch the first time) and while they are large and visually pleasing it looks like there are a lot of raisins or blueberries when there isn't and they were the DRIEST baked goods I've ever had. 

I will have to agree with the other persons review, the service is friendly but really slow even when you're the only person there. They only have one person working at a time and the female worker speaks really rough English it was pretty difficult to understand."}
{"text":"Staple in the community. 

They have great coffee, good for breakfast or lunch.

Western sandwich is a local favourite. Come on Fridays for the Philly cheese steak lunch special.

(Take it from the Duke ;) )"}
