{"text":"Paid $2 for the worst cupcake I've ever tasted in my entire life. The ones at No Frills taste better. Cake was mediocre, icing had a weird tasteless flavor and the consistency was disgusting. I went looking for cake but all of their cold cut cakes looked terrible (and they didn't have any good flavors). If their cakes taste like their cupcakes, I'm surprised they even attempt to sell them."}
{"text":"I love this bakery and caf√©, their toast is very good and their cakes are tasty, I always order their hot chocolate too. The sitting area is nice, in the summer is an outdoor patio and in the winter a nice indoor sitting area with glass walls. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here to try their famous custard tart, left with no disappointment. Best tasting custard tart ever in life. 4.5/5! Only thing is if they can make it less sweet then no doubt is a 5/5. I will go bck and buy again for sure."}
{"text":"Great hours & service.  Tried the custard tarts they are filled more than the ones you would get from the other bakeries. They are not as sweet and more delicious!  Next time I go in I will definitely try their variety of  breads and doughnut!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible, the girls at the counter refuse to speak English with you and the actual food is just as bad. Got their shrimp patties (gross, pasty and salty with no actual shrimp), a brownie (tasted like box mix and frosting from a can), and a cannoli (it was soggy and the filling was runny)."}
{"text":"They had very good custard tart. They had varieties of beautiful pastries. The shops were nicely decorated, clean, and spacious. It was very nice place. Prices were good.  I do not know why they had so many staff. Whenever someone ordered something, they were excited and screamed one another in Portuguese. I did not know what it was.  It was different from being energetic, but it was something."}
{"text":"I just left this place and seriously don't even want to eat what I just purchased. When paying for my cake the lady at the till was too engrossed in a conversation with another lady that she didn't even look at us. She told us the price in Portuguese which I asked her to repeat in English and got ignored. Then, after paying with my card she didn't even bother taking the receipt until I reached to grab it. She then just placed it in front of her. Without even tasting what I bough I won't go again just based on the awful customer service."}
{"text":"You have to try their custard tarts!! I've always loved them and apart from the ones I've had in Portugal...these are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The worst customer service in the city, walk a little further to any of the other many bakeries in the area."}
{"text":"I have tried this place driven more by the curiosity then the knowledge of the reviews around the net. Overall I liked the place. It's more like a 3.5 stars but before I raise my rating, I'll have to come back few more times to be accurate.
The service was very good: fast and accurate and in my case, prompt to fix a mistake I have made when I placed my order. There is such a variety of baked goods. I had a couple of Portuguese mini tarts and a Portuguese coffee.

The place offers both, eat in and take away. There is an area with some chairs and tables inside and outside just in case you want to sit and have you drinks. They sell product either from from Portugal and Brazil.
Everything is priced well."}
{"text":"If you are going there for the Portuguese Custards then you are in luck. They are delicious. Just do NOT get any other pastries that are not Portuguese ... They are terrible!!!! And as for the service, the lady at the cash was horrendous ... She was on the phone the whole time, hand waved me quickly to move down, did not speak one word to me not even to tell me the amount and took my money. No, 'thank you come again', no smile, nothing. It will probably make my decide to never visit again. Custards or not."}
{"text":"It is fortunate to have a bakery this good so close by. I've been going here for two years, and for the constant flow of cars and people I can tell that the clientele is growing. I'm happy for them because the quality of everything they bake and import is remarkable.

When my sister and cousin came to visit from Mexico, they woke up early, and go to Dolce Minho for a coffee, tarts, and small breads for bocadillos. They just loved the variety, freshness, and quality of everything. They wished they had a Portuguese bakery in Mexico City...

It doesn't matter if you don't have a sweet tooth, I rather saltiness and I can't resist their beer, beans and pastel de leche tarts, as well as their lil tiramisus.

I'm also a fan of their corn bread, baguettes and small round shaped breads, which can be used to fix some tasty original snacks.

They sell cold cuts, whole cheeses, and they can even put your picture on a cake...

Are you on your lunch break? You can drink an expresso at the counter, wake up, make digestion, and go back to work...

If you have time and you want to have brunch or breakfast with family or friends, they have a terrace, there is a park infront (in case you come with kids) and the street is quiet.

The only thing is that if you come during rush hour you need to be patient because the ladies at the counter can be overwhelmed by the affluence of people."}
{"text":"I have mixed reviews with this place. Its a great bakery nice girls at the counter, good pastery and a nice setting. I do feel like if you don't speak Portuguese they kinda ignore you."}
{"text":"This is a Portuguese bakery, they have really good sweets! The small desserts are great, but their cakes are the best, I always buy for bdays and celebrations. Way better than any other cakes at this same price, it's around $30 for a 12 pieces cake.
The only bad part of this bakery is the service, some of their people is a little rude sometimes."}
{"text":"For my first review on here I thought I'd just write a quick one about this place, since nobody had reviewed it yet. 

This review is based on one thing, and one thing only: the custard tarts. They're my favourite. If you know the Portuguese custard tarts then you know what I mean, if not: soft custard, flaky pastry, burnt top... Maybe you know the Chinatown version, which is ok, but positively awful compared to these (from which I believe they're derived, but I might be wrong).

Anyway, they're amazing. If you've had the Nova Era versions, they're better than those. In any case, worth the trip out here. I've bought buns there a few times and they're good, but not overwhelmingly so like the tarts. And a nice little place as well, with very decent espresso, and guarana Brazilia. Looks like an assortment of other Portuguese delicacies too, but I don't know much about anything other than the tarts! Oh, the tarts... If you buy a half dozen, eat one when it's fresh... then the next day warm them up a bit before you eat them.  Ohhh... I'm just going to eat one right now."}
{"text":"I have been incredibly bad this Easter weekend.  Just needed to treat myself for a few days ... and treat I did --- LOL.  We are talking major carb. relapse extraordinaire.

Poor Hubster was navigating all the construction and chaos on Dufferin Street - but it was worth it!

They had (and I partook of) *hangs head*:
Bolo Arrois (rice sponge cake, dusted with icing sugar) - 5/5
Pasteis de nada (custard tarts) - 5/5
Corn bread - 5/5 (according to the Spouse-those are for him)
Risois de Camarao (shrimp) and cod rissois- 100/5 (seriously)
Carrot cake - 3.5/5
Glace fruit cake - 5/5
Double espresso - 5/5
Service:  5+/5

This is an incredible place.  I grew up in Cape Town, with a ton of Portuguese food from Madeira and the Portuguese mainland -- everything they sell here is 100% authentic Portuguese.  Love this bakery.  Swift.  Polite.  Friendly.  I have been coming here for years.  Obrigada Amigas!!!!"}
{"text":"My review is mixed as I feel bad customer service comes before amazing food.

I've been coming here for years and love most of the pastries, I mainly come here for natas and papsecos as they are ALWAYS fresh!

My complaint is for customer service. I do notice that even though I'm Portuguese they will choose to serve you first before someone else of a different  ethnicity. 

I've witnessed it a lot and It's happened with someone I know who was waiting in line and the ladies were about to start serving those behind him! Had I gone in with him it would be a totally different story. Of course he said something but it was obvious to be a race issue as their speaking in Portuguese calling out orders from behind him to try and get served first.

Shame on those Portuguese customers who believe that because it's a Portuguese bakery they can just walk in and call out orders while SOMEONE is standing in front of them waiting. And shame on the girls serving who respond to them when they can see others have been waiting before."}
{"text":"Probably the closest you will find to real authentic Portuguese pastries in the GTA , they have a lot to choose from and its all very fresh, definitely go try their stuff I know they have the best custard tarts"}
