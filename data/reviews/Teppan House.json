{"text":"Amazing place for family gathering! Fresh and hot food, fast and friendly service. Also The price is reasonable"}
{"text":"Wow, my experience yesterday compared to when I came before when they were called \"New Generation\" was vastly different. I came by on Monday for dinner and was immediately seated by the hostess. Afterwards we were given iPads to order our food. Our server was extremely friendly and attentive which we really appreciated. Everything was going great until we sent in our orders.

The food took a really long time to arrive. They were short staffed with only one cook working and it was busy for a Monday night. Orders that I placed at 6:45 did not fully arrive until 9:50ish... more than 2 later. We were still missing a few items that we ordered but had to pay and leave because it was getting late. 

On the bright side, the quality of the food was really good. The sashimi was really fresh and they had a variety of different foods so that was great. As delicious as the food was, by the time we actually received it, we had lost most of our appetite since we waited for so long.

The reason why I rated the restaurant a 2 star and not a 1 star was because I understood that this was a error with management and them not knowing it would be busy on a Monday since before they didn't open on Mondays. Our server was really apologetic explaining the situation and the chef was working really hard from what we seen. 

I would be returning because I like the food, but most likely not on a weekday during dinner time unless they sort through their staffing issues."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst service we have ever encountered when we went. They use a digital order system that you see in a lot of sushi places now, yet they forgot 3-4 items! I let one of the servers know after 10 minutes of staring at the ceiling waiting for a server and they said they'll have a look. Still didn't come (maybe because he didn't ask which ones didn't come...) After all of this, some of food came after dessert. I told the supervisor what happened and all he said was \"is that right?\" and nothing more. The food tastes good and presented well but not worth it if they continue to have terrible service."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, best value on all u can eat sushi and teppanyaku, fusion roll must try."}
{"text":"Love their AYCE sushi side for all the variety and quality. Love their Tappanyaki tables for the service and quality of food as well! Overall, service at this place is great and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Ended up here because we were just SUPER HUNGRY and of course we forgot to Read the Yelp reviews before coming here.  It was a Saturday night and I wanted to try out their Teppenyaki dinner but did not realize we should have made reservations first as it was all booked.  Oh well...maybe next time.

However, they do have their AYCE sushi here so we stayed and ate everything we could.  I can tell you that my standards for AYCE are not high whatsoever and I really do not expect much in terms of quality or service. You get what you pay for as the saying goes.  

This place is nicely decorated and I can probably make an assumption that the Owner or Manager of this place is either really really cheap, is trying to conserve a lot of food, or simply just trying to limit the amount of wasted food people leave.  The portions of everything were Extremely Tiny!  Im talkin about half pieces of Sashimi and all their deep fried items were super greasy.  Service was what you expect but I can tell you that the quality was well below AYCE even though the standards arent that high.

I would not come back here for AYCE sushi as the vibe you get is it \"pretends\" to be AYCE but really is lacking in somewhat decent quality."}
{"text":"Was looking for a Teppanyaki restaurant for dinner, found this place on Yelp as it look decent since it was an average rating. When we got there, they told us that Teppanyaki is only available for reserved seating on weekends so we opted for AYCE sushi instead. The clientele was mostly caucasian and for a Friday night, it wasn't busy at all. Perhaps, because the location wasnt the greatest hidden in a commercial plaza.

So onto the food, we honestly thought the owner was being cheap as almost everything that came out was literally bite size pieces. The sashimi was 1/3 the size of a regular cut piece of fish and to top that off, each person had like a drop of wasabi each so we had to keep asking for more. The only item that was decent was the kalbi, it was tasty and didn't have much fat on it. All the deep fried items such as the tofu, spring rolls and tempura were oily and had no flavour. 

To make the experience more unpleasant, I don't think that the servers understood English because they kept duplicating the items that we already ordered so we had to keep telling them \"we got that already\". I think the server's name was Tina and she just had poor communication skills. For such a nicely decorated restaurant , they really need to focus on not being so sparse with their food because with the price that you are paying, customers would expect more. And yes, it's an all you can eat restaurant so don't be so cheap."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and I love it! The food is always fresh, and the staff are always friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Worst I mean WORST experience I've ever had at any restaurant in my life! Started off as soon as we sat down we weren't given a menu, after 10 minutes we asked a lady who actually ended up being the manager for a menu and she gave us an iPad (mind you it was lunch time and the place was not busy whatsoever). As we are looking through the menu the waiter comes over, snatches the iPad and says \"i don't know why she gave you that iPad it's not working\" (it was working perfectly fine) and proceeds to try to take our order without us being able to look at the menu.. once we finally placed our order with a waiter that made us feel like a bother and annoying, we proceeded to wait another 20 minutes for our order! Mind you we had now been sitting for 30 minutes and no one had offer us anything to drink? We ordered items from the lunch special which comes with salad and miso soup, we didn't receive either until we got tired of waiting for it and finally asked which at this point we are practically done with our entrees.. at this point we are beyond frustrated!! Throughout the whole visit every time we asked any of the waiters a question they always seemed annoyed they responded quickly and walked away as if they were just trying to get rid of us. Their lack of customer service really got to me because it's such a beautiful restaurant and I had heard nothing but good reviews. But I was beyond disappointed with the visit and therefore I will not be coming back. If you're looking for a great AYCE for a good price try Shogi Sushi just down the street their customer service is out of this world!"}
{"text":"The servers were not attentive at all on a Wednesday night and I found the rice to have way too much vinegar in it which was AWFUL. The location is in an awkward area. My friend warned me not to come here because they have worked here before and saw one of the servers pick up a dropped shrimp tempera from the floor at the back and put it back on the plate to serve to a costumer. I did not believe them and took my chances. After coming here my mind was changed and telling them about my experience coming here, apparently they also reuse the decorated bamboo leaves and make the servers soak them in a water bucket and pick it up after for the new dish. YUCK imagine how many different sushis and costumers that has been through...... btw i also got a dish with the decorative bamboo leaves on it DISGUSTING!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Went here for lunch and everything was fantastic. One of the better places in Vaughan. Their special rolls were unique and so good. Worth the price."}
{"text":"Food was really good!  TEP chef could have used some animation. He was nice and made some jokes. Other chefs were more animated 

Reservations are needed. Thankfully we made them. 

Tons of food.  Amazing value. And very good quality. Pop is super expensive and wine is priced cheaper than most places, but the rest of the meal is priced well. 

Quality is very good. Scallops are amazing. Almost everything we ate we all liked which says a lot for an a la cart place. 

Will be back for sure. Everyone loved it!"}
{"text":"Overall very nice place. Food is great. However would suggest you dine in. The lunch specials some times are not the best."}
{"text":"Reservation at 8:30, still waiting at 9:30 for our table. The food is overpriced, and the wait is not worth it. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Came back today again for AYCE Dinner.

Quality remains consitent. I just noticed that it took quite long to get the order, although it was not busy on Sunday at all.  All servers are very very nice, so really no any complaint for that. 

I was disappointed that they didn't have Deep Fried Chicken Cartilage today. It's the one dish that I wanted to come back for. I also tried Beef Tataki again and I don't really recommend it. The beef slices is super tiny and was not very well-made. 

Sashimi is fresh and nicely decorated when served. 

For dessert, they now added Strawberry ice cream.

My recommended dishes:
Deep Fried Chicken Cartilage 
Mussels 
Kaki Fry
Yam Fry
Negima Maki
Fusion Maki
BBQ Maki
Salmon Rose
Assorted Sashimi"}

*Very nice dining enviroment.
*Decent menu and delicious food.
*Will try tennpanyaki next time, my kids are so looking forward to it."}
{"text":"We dined here to celebrate my daughter's birthday, made reservations for Teppan AYCE buffet in advance (needed).  On the special night, we walked in, was asked to wait a few mins and was lead to an upstairs area with tables surrounding cook tops. Decor was modern and the place was very clean.

We were given a iPad to order various AYCE sushi, appetizers and various menu items which can be ordered throughout the meal. The iPad also had drink, wine and dessert items for order in addition to AYCE, all was clearly laid out and easy to understand with no surprises. Pricing was calculated in the pad in real time so it was almost dummy proof.

The Teppan started late at our table, I noticed that the food was portioned for each table  based on the number of seats occupying that table, I was a little surprised that it was not all you can eat or able to accommodate for a larger portion if asked. We had two people that moved from another table to ours, as a result, some items were in short supply (only had 1 rib  and small piece of salmon for dinner vs seemingly more steak, chicken and rice). Although, I wonder if those were short as well, not complaining as I had enough with the portion served on the items that were not \"one of\".

We happily ordered lots of sushi during our meal and was content with the freshness as well as the attentive service throughout our dinner. The cook tried to entertain us, but, language was a bit of a barrier, I also noticed the shows and level of fun was different at each table and was based on personalities not only by the cooks but guests as well. Some of the \"folk\" at our table were tough to make happy and that dampened some of the fun.

Since I had made reservations for a \"Birthday\" I would expected someone to say something about it at some point during our meal, or at least bring it up/have a special mention and offer upsell for the occasion, this was not the case. The only person who said something was \"Doug\" who took our reservation days earlier and remembered the purpose of our visit as he watched us leave. 

Overall the table side meal was not bad, however, there was room for improvement. Sushi, soups and other items that were served by the kitchen were good and well liked. Pricing was $32.99 per person and quality was fair but given the price, expectations were set slightly higher than Mandarin (of course).  

I would return but probably not for the AYCE Teppan dinner since the kitchen outperformed the table side chefs in taste and quality as well as being cheaper per person. This seems like the best course given the mistakes I noticed table side."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food and huge portions! Chef was animated and very engaging. I will definitely come here again. Great for kids as well."}
