{"text":"We stopped by after the Taiyou Con. Tiny little place like a mom and pop outfit in a strip mall. But man is the food good! We had vegetable tempura, vermicelli with egg roll, and Pad Thai. All excellent with fresh cilantro, lettuce, sprouts, etc. portions are big. Our waiter and waitress barely spoke English-- it was like having dinner in Vietnam. I loved it."}
{"text":"Took my family and my son's friends from ASU.  The place is a little hole in the wall.  A family run restaurant.   They we were very slow. We had to get our own silverware.  Rice was old and not fresh.  The mango salad was heavy on sauce. The fam didn't like it.  Egg rolls were good. Pad thai was good. The basil egplant was a flop. More green onions than basil.  Basil rice noodles had hardly any basil.  Curry came is a very big bowl and was okay.  Portions were large."}
{"text":"There is an authentic Vietnamese vegetarian menu...Just ask for it!  This place is great...they cater to meat eaters, vegetarians and vegans who want either an authentic Vietnamese fare or the traditional American Vietnamese fare. They even have different menus too. I always order from the authentic Vietnamese vegetarian one....But be aware...they have A LOT of options on their menus! If you order from the authentic Vietnamese menu, your order will take a lot longer than from the regular menu...and you can tell, they take their time in preparing each dish. Its definitely worth it ! So dont be in a rush here... ..  Everything I have always ordered was delicious.  They even have brown rice!  I just dont care for their fake pork substitute in anything. Not a fan of the fake meats but their chicken substitute and their beef substitute in their authentic dishes are pretty good.  We always order one their salads as an appetizer, they are all delicious with their unique flavors. Lotus root with mango salad is probably my favorite. Veggie pho, lots of noodles, soups and rice dishes...too many to list.  The owner is real sweet too. She always checks in with you to see if you like the dish.  We will definitely be back to check out something different from their extensive menu.  Place is across the street from Mekongs plaza tucked away at the corner of a strip mall, near a smoke shop. Its two restaurants in one......"}
{"text":"What a find! We are staying at the Green Acres RV park, which is essentially catty-corner to this restaurant and wanted to walk to a healthy place to eat. Well, Green Lotus is delicious. We ate vegan noodle pho, a different noodle soup and pad thai - and they were all yummy. The prices are really reasonable, too. Finally, there is a sister Vietnamese restaurant connected to Green Lotus, so your meat-eating friends can enjoy their traditional favorites, as well."}
{"text":"Excellent vegan! Nice selection of various Asian dishes. Add soy chicken to anything you order. It's the best!"}
{"text":"First, if you're planning on eating a meatless meal, be sure to let your server know *as soon as you are seated*.The restaurant is divided into two seating areas, and apparently one side serves meat. After reading the other reviews here, the owner should definitely make this more apparent in order to avoid confusion and accidental meat consumption :/  From the vegan menu I have tried the Yellow Coconut curry. It's very flavorful and filled with lots of fresh veggies. You can also add tofu or soy-based mock meats to it for some added variety and flavor. My only complaint is that the portion of rice it comes with seems to be a tad meager.. but that may just be because I really love rice.  This is a good spot to check out if you're around MCC and looking for a decent vegan meal."}
{"text":"Out here in Tempe for vacation from San Francisco and found this place on Happy Cow. I was a little afraid it would be  so-so, cause the last vegan place I went to in Tempe was just bland and boring. I was wrong, the food and the service was fantastic. The couple that works there are so nice and sweet. I ended up ordering food for my next meal to-go, too."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and it was fantastic!  All our dishes were very tasty and were not lacking in flavor. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"We hope more people take advantage of this place. We were the only diners during our entire meal but food was really tasty and the servings were huge. The chef/owner/waiter is a long time vegetarian but also cooks in a Vietnamese restaurant next-door that serves meat.  She is clearly very talented.  We had delicious mango salad, mushroom stew, and pho, and ate every morsel. Menu is huge and the space is about as low frills as it can get with fluorescent lights, canned music, and unmatched furniture, but the price is right and I consider it part of the adventure!  I give it 5 stars for food and friendly, very informal service, and a 1 for decor, but focus on the food and you'll be fine!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, good sized portions for the entr√©es, friendly and quick service. First time here, and won't be the last. Definitely excited to try more of this menu."}
{"text":"Great people, great food. Its hard to find vegan pho. I never write reviews but this place deserves several good reviews. A lot of heart in this place."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, and I wish it delivered farther into Gilbert.    Finally, decent options for delivery when you are craving vegetarian food!  I recommend the pumpkin curry."}
{"text":"Ordered rad na and crispy eggrolls. I love the taste. Delicious vegan food for sure! Order came in promptly and guy was nice. Will order delivery here again!"}

I hope the food is worth the wait  Well I finally tried it and it's quite tasty.  However, it is extremely oily.  So it's great for vegans but if you're watching your calories, it may not be your best choice."}

{"text":"Green Lotus Vegetarian and Pho Bamboo are owned by the same people, and they share a kitchen. When we walked in, they told us to sit in Pho Bamboo because it made it easier for the wait staff to serve us. It was pretty disappointing to drive all the way here and for it to not feel like a vegetarian/vegan dining experience.  The food itself was mediocre. There were a lot of options to choose from, and we decided on the spicy basil noodles and eggplant stew. The noodles were alright - good amount of vegetables, not a ton of flavor. The eggplant stew was incredibly salty. The eggplant was soaked in a thick brown sauce and almost inedible without tons of water to wash it down. Overall a pretty disappointing experience :("}
{"text":"We absolutely adore this place. There are so many options and everything tastes amazing. They only downside is that it can be a little pricey but we can't help but treat ourselves time and time again to Green Lotus Vegetarian."}
{"text":"I got the vegan combo fried rice, with different types of faux meat. They gave me about 5 little pieces of the faux meat, the rest was rice. My stir fried veggies came on the side, that was weird. Overall it was $12 for very basic, bland fried rice. It also did not smell good in there, nor was it very clean. I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Wonderful and filling food. I ordered spring rolls, tempura tofu, and spicy fried rice and the miss got Pad Thai but spicy all good and tasty. Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and the food is good. Quiet atmosphere. It's a hit or miss on service and waiting time. But a great option for vegetarians! I highly recommend the 'mi tiem' if you like noodle soups. Or the pho is pretty good as well!"}
{"text":"Well I may not be experienced in the ways of the Vegan and Vegetarians, ssshhh..I'm only Veg-Curious but this place just left me feeling confused. The service was friendly however our server seemed almost as confused as I was, but considering we were a large party perhaps it was just a bit overwhelming for him. The place was cute but the d√©cor was tattered and could use some tlc. The forks were in a tin container on the table, fork side up which left you having to try to get one without touching the others and the bathroom was missing soap and paper towels  . ..not a good combination.  When you walk in to Green Lotus Vegetarian it is open to the restaurant next door, Pho Bamboo(not vegetarian) both owned and ran by the same owners. There were also two menus, an American and a Vietnamese, both listing soy or tofu in the ingredients. I'm not a vegetarian but I'd assume that these ingredients meant at least the food was... I didn't order an appetizer because I planned to order the fried banana egg rolls with ice cream, it sounded amazing but later found out they were out of both the coconut and green tea ice cream. ..guess my yoga pants survive another day of torture. I ordered the Spicy Basil Noodles with chicken, it was spicy and tasted good and was vegetarian. My Vegetarian friend however ordered Pho with what was assumed to be vegetarian soy chicken and beef.... it was not! How that happens in a vegetarian restaurant ordering from a vegetarian menu is confusing to me and unPHOgivable for her!  One thing I'm not confused about, she won't be coming back and I will continue my search for  veg-satisfaction elsewhere..."}
{"text":"We got the Chow Mein and Red Curry dish on our visit today. I have to say the food was delicious! Very flavorful and just the right level of spicy! Also tried their Thai Tea and Thai Coffee. The only complaint id have is that the Chow Mein had way too much vegetables and a very small amount of noodles. Also, once we got our food and drinks no one came to check up on us to see if we needed anything."}
{"text":"After a long day of traveling cross country, filled with airport snacks, we REALLY needed a good meal. Imagine our surprise when we stumbled upon this gem in the desert! Yes, vegetarian! Such a delicious, expertly prepared, delivered to our hotel room in 40 minutes, bargain that it prompted this foodie to post her very first yelp review! We split three dishes for just over $20 (minus tax & delivery fee). The Tempura tofu,6 large, triangles with dipping sauce. It was crispy and satisfying. Not one iota of excess grease! The Larb salad was spot on. Refreshing and light with two types of tofu. It's a dish that is heavy on the red onion, so heads up date-nighters! And finally, mango sticky rice. Warm, sweet & coconutty. Not too heavy.  Perfection! We will definitely be stopping by the restaurant for another recharge while we are out exploring over the next few days."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! Obviously all the stars are either from friends or employees. I asked wash my hands before I place an order and out comes a employee with a magazine in his hands out of the bathroom and he didn't wash his hands (the sink is where you can see it). So I decided to pass on eating there so not to be rude I ordered a coffee to go. I ordered a hot coffee from the server but was given one coffee on ice. one The same man from the restroom decides to grab a cup of already made coffee that's cold in the fridge and warmed it up. I was shocked at what I was witnessing! I don't know about you but when I order a coffee I like it fresh not sitting there and Lord knows how long it's been sitting there. Obviously all you people who gave  five stars have no idea what it's like to eat at a clean restaurant. This place is disgusting if you don't mind catching E. coli or getting food poisoning, then this places for you!   I love food and good restaurants but OMG! I'm surprise this place is still open. They have horrible service, it's very dirty and I don't care to be around a car seat and cleaning supplies around my table wherever I dine. I don't know who's car seat that was but I was the only one there so enough said. If this is the kind of place for you, enjoy! I will never recommend nor walk through those doors again! They don't even deserve one star! YUCK"}
{"text":"I ordered \"Spicy Noodles.\"  Those are not noodles, it was not spicy the soy \"beef\" was a salty piece of leather. Worst of all it was $25 for an appetizer and an entree! ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE"}
{"text":"I've lived in the Phoenix area pretty much my whole life, but I'll freely admit I don't make it out to Mesa that often.  In fact I'm pretty sure this is my first Mesa business review on Yelp (go ahead Mesa residents, let me have it).  But leave it to Norm R and Tigra C of the Phoenix area Yelp Veg-Curious UYE crew to go outside the box and find a vegetarian friendly spot to lure me near Downtown Mesa.  I've been to a number of valley vegetarian friendly spots with an Asian tilt that I really enjoyed (Vegan House & Veggie Village to name a few), so I was fairly optimistic about this place going in.  So how did my first true in-depth culinary experience in Mesa go?  When I first walked in, I was a little confused by the setup for a number of reasons.  First thing I noticed was that an office desk was right out in the middle of the restaurant and was populated by enough paperwork and equipment such that it really did appear to be the makeshift office for the owners.  There was also a full sized ladder taking up space in between a pair of tables along the wall.  Additionally the menu that the business advertises on their website is actually just one of two menus they have available.  There's a vegan/vegetarian menu that they call their \"American\" menu (although that menu has plenty of Asian classics to choose from), and then there's an entirely separate menu which serves Vietnamese items (both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, though the menu descriptions don't always make that clear).  The additional menu sent me into a little bit of a scramble mode as I suddenly found myself studying over what looked like more than 100 Vietnamese menu item choices in addition to the regular menu.  While the Vietnamese items looked tempting, I decided to stick with the items they originally advertised on their regular menu.  For starters, I went with their King Egg Rolls.  3 egg rolls filled with carrots, taro root, bean thread, tofu, onions, and yellow bean served with sweet and sour sauce.  I'm thinking this was meant to mimic the flavor of king crab.  The filling certainly had the texture of crab, though not quite the flavor.  The dipping sauce was also a little unusual in that it was thinner and milder than most sweet & sour sauces I've had, but pretty decent.  For my entree I settled on the Pad Thai.  Rice noodles with tofu, bean sprouts, green onions, shredded carrots and ground peanuts.  In an unexpected twist they also doused it with peppers (though the menu didn't advertise that fact).  As a result, the Pad Thai was pretty spicy.  Not overwhelmingly so, but enough to where I needed H2O to cool my mouth pretty frequently.  I would've preferred the spice level to be a little more subtle to be honest, and the flavoring in the noodles were a little flat to me.  I liked the tofu chunks and the other veggies, but overall not one of the better Pad Thais I've had.  For dessert I asked for the banana egg rolls with ice cream.  At first, I asked for coconut ice cream with the rolls.  The waiter came back and said they only had mint ice cream.  Okay, let's go with that.  Waiter comes back a minute later and says they don't have any ice cream at all.  Sigh.  Alright just the egg rolls.  The four dessert egg rolls came out piping hot and covered in chocolate sauce.  These were delish, with a good mix of sweet and crunch.  But boy I'll bet these really would've gone nicely with some of that coconut ice cream.  Bummer.  Total cost for the food, tax, and tip came to $27.  I was plenty full from the meal and the service we got was very friendly, though the execution was a bit clumsy.  Between giving me misinformation on the ice cream, to misplacing the Pho spoons for the table, to accidentally bringing a meat Pho to one of our group members (instead of the vegetarian Pho she'd asked for), there's room for improvement on the service side.  I'd give my experience 3 stars, but just barely.  Sorry Mesa, my first deep dive into a local restaurant didn't go quite as I'd hoped.  I've recently put other Mesa restaurants on my Bookmarks list to go explore in the near future, so this won't be my only glance at the city's culinary scene.  But Green Lotus probably won't be on my list of local haunts to revisit anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's so hard to find an authentic vegetarian Vietnamese restaurant in AZ. One day, I decided to try this place and surprised by the quality and the portion of food. I barely finish one time. I love everything here, especially the lemongrass stir fried vegan chicken. Friendly staffs service as well. Everyone should come and try !!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed. It is basically a part over now the restaurant which serves meat and everything else so it is the same kitchen which is a dealbreaker for a lot of vegans"}
{"text":"They are all vegan despite the vegetarian tag. I love their lotus salad. Good portion and very freshly made dish."}
{"text":"1/2 a star?? I ordered online through Seamless for delivery. I was just outside Green Lotus delivery area. They had not updated their boundaries and so I sat for 45 minutes waiting on food that was ultimately cancelled. Then Seamless called and said they would refund my $21 - in 3-5 business days! So sitting here hungry AND money taken out. Very unprofessional. No recompense or call from the restaurant. Don't go there. Jokesters!"}
{"text":"Went here and it was odd to say the least. It was good enough to go back is my short answer. My long answer is the waiter was.... Bad? He was dirty, badly dresses, and his nose wasn't clean. Kinda puts you off your food when you have to look up at someone's nose gold. But that was the worst part. The food was lovely, and the little old lady who was there was the cutest. She was so happy that we liked their food and bowed to us when we left. The restaurant itself was small and the atmosphere reminded me of when I lived in Japan, especially the eclectic decor. Like I said, we'll be back. I just hope they improve the writer's hygiene by next time."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to my motel. It was prompt, food was hot and cold accordingly, and was good. So happy to find vegan options for delivery. The delivery person was professional, courteous, efficient and personable."}
{"text":"We have been trying to expand our repertoire of Vegetarian places with this Valley's geography, and this expansion brought us to the Green Lotus Vegetarian restaurant.  It is located within a nondescript shopping center approximately a mile west of Old Downtown Mesa.  With the various cuisine types now offering Vegetarian options, we were quite intrigued and excited to partake of Vegetarian Vietnamese food.   When we ordered, we opted to try out typical Vietnamese Cuisine favorites that we were normally familiar with to see if their Vegetarian counterparts would prove just as delectable.  And we were definitely not disappointed!  The Vegetarian egg rolls were fresh and crunchy. The vegetables contained within were quite tasty, and the accompanying sweet and sour sauce just enhanced their inherent flavors.  I had the Vegetable Soup. It was comprised of cabbage, carrots, broccoli, celery. All were quite fresh. For good measure, I also chose to add the Soy Chicken along with it.   Its flavor was fairly close to a typical Pho Bo Tai that one often encounters in a typical Vietnamese restaurant - without the Beef ingredient, of course.  My wife had the Yellow Curry. The coconut cream sauce that it was immersed in was simply amazing. And the vegetables that they came with were also quite fresh  and appetizing.  One additional and notable point were the generous portion sizes of the main entrees. They really wanted to make sure that they didn't skimp on you getting your money's worth with regarding these dishes.  This place was simply a marvelous discovery for us.   If we hadn't done our research, and expanded our perspective beyond the typical geographies that we frequent for certain types of foods; we would've missed out on this gem located within Mesa!"}
{"text":"Best pho in town. The portions are large but the quality is excellent. Staff are very friendly as well."}
{"text":"I say I like to have options, but in reality most menus have just two or there veg options which makes ordering quite simple. Green lotus had over 30 veg options with over 5 Pho` options alone. Needless to say ordering took some time.  This place has a different feel, it is on the side of another pho` restraint, there is an empty fish tank in back and a table covered in newspapers that the employees read between customers.   The food it self was quite good, I enjoyed having stirfired veggies and tofu atop of fried noodle next with a rich brown sauce."}
{"text":"Food is very good.  But the owner is even better.  Super nice.  Fully appreciative of your patronage.  I don't know if you knew it was my first time or not, but she brought me out complimentary rice and an egg roll.  I thought that was extremely nice of her.  I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their \"mock meat\" is great for those of us who still want the texture (and protein) of meat or who have just gone vegetarian. Their dishes are creative and delicious."}
{"text":"Great food that's cruelty-free, healthy, AND good for the environment! Only wish they'd staff up a bit better as the service can be hit or miss sometimes, in terms of speed. Regardless, very much worth a visit--highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Make no mistake. I'm a meat eater.   However, I have lots of friends who are vegetarian/ vegan. When we have a hankering for Vietnamese or Thai food, this is the place to go. The few times I've been here, there's one person who seems to run the front of house. Therefore, be patient. Otherwise, just sit back and enjoy the food.   Note: there are two menus. One is traditional Vietnamese and the other is Haole friendly:) Both are great. I lean toward the soy beef and fish dishes. The shrimp was okay, and I haven't tried the soy chicken or soy pork (when I do, I'll update).   Favorite dishes? Basil eggplant with soy beef and the fresh spring rolls with soy fish. So yummy!  If you're super stubborn and really need meat, just ask them for the meat menu. This place is next to a sister restaurant that serves Vietnamese food - meat and all!"}
{"text":"We have had takeout twice from here. It is very tasty AND healthy. Lots of good veggies and brown rice. We have enjoyed the Stir Fry with Veggies and fresh basil, the special combination fried rice and the vegetarian Pho with rice noodles. They are great about taking the time to explain the menu and are very good about accommodating your special requests. Try this delicious restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've never had Thai food & this place has me hooked! I wish I could eat this everyday. Their fried tofu was on point even the \"meat\" eaters loved it. Their tofu fried rice delicious. Their vegan pad thai amazing. They deliver & portions are huge. Come to vegas."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover this place is sooooooo good! Amazing is all I can say! Best vegan food and you wouldn't even know it's vegan.  We've been 3x in 2 weeks and can't wait to go back. From the spring rolls to the spicy basil noodle, mango salad it's all been AMAZING!"}
{"text":"If you go here, prepare to have it stay at the top of your list for veg friendly restaurants in Phoenix. It's amazing food and always full. I waited about 8 mins for my to go order and it was perfect. Order the BFF. It's amazing and Vegan friendly! I really appreciate that they list what is soy free on their menu too! So good!"}
{"text":"Small and cozy location may need a few upgrades. The food was really good I ordered the combination plate which had fried rice with soy chicken, soy meat, and soy shrimp. The taste of the rice the soy meats were perfect. I also ordered a lemonade that took a while to come out but when it did it had a refreshing taste to it. There was nothing special about it but it was good. At the time we were there they were not very busy and we did not get checked on but the staff was friendly. I noticed that you can call ahead and order your food or it can also be delivered. They also did have free wifi in there which is a cute perk. I would like to try more plates because they do have a variety of foods there."}
{"text":"Oh my God! I had to wait 1 hour 30 minutes for the order and called them multiple times. They asked me if I wanted to cancel the order rather than being apologetic, lost my appetite completely. Really bad first experience!"}
{"text":"So so so good!!!! When I go here I actually have to hold back from getting a bunch of different items because everything is so good. One of few vegan places in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing vegetarian options !! The vegetarian pho was delicious and was made within minutes of ordering."}
{"text":"First time here. Played it safe and got pad Thai and spring rolls. The food was great. Really likes the soy shrimp. Didn't give it five stars for one reason, it could be a bit more tidy and clean. But I will come again and refer it to friends."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The yellow curry was good and it came out quickly. I was about three bites in and I saw a huge cockroach run across the floor. Beware!!!"}
{"text":"Authentic vegetarian vietnamese food.  Pho is truly outstanding - still have the yummy healthy taste in my mouth!  Spring rolls are overly stuffed with goodness. Eggplant dish full of flavor. It's simply the best healthy vegetarian place we have visited in Ariz. so far.   Food is very comparable with the restaurants in Westminster, CA.   It's a small and unassuming place located in a so so strip mall but just off the light rail (Sycamore stop) and across the street from the asian mall Mekong Plaza.  Thank you again for a wonderful meal and kind friendly service. We will be back 100% and can't wait to sample more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT PLACE. Just started working around the area and all I can say is THANK GOODNESS! We need more places like this. Vegan (check), healthy (check), affordable (check), awesome service (check), happy bellies (check). I can't think of one bad thing. My go to dish at all vegan hot spots is the vermicelli with soy beef. Well this place raised the standard so I can only imagine how other items will taste (mouth watering just thinking about my next adventure there). I also had the sweet mango dessert. It was acceptable. A little on the tart side but maybe mangoes were not in season. I guess I have to try it again another time to come to a concrete decision."}
{"text":"**Update: there are two menus here, a menu catering to more \"American\" taste items and one with authentic Vietnamese vegetarian. This review is for the Vietnamese menu**  Warning: if you like super clean, wanna-be fancy ikea decorated restaurants and don't like authentic Vietnamese food...this is not the restaurant for you!  I think Vietnamese vegetarian food is incredibly underrated and very over shadowed by more popular dishes like pho and spring rolls. With a large Buddhist population, Vietnamese make some of the best vegetarian meals, although I admit I am slightly biased. Even if you're not vegetarian like me, you would be considering it if you tried Vietnamese imitation meat.  After moving from socal, my expectations for Arizona Asian food is very low, but this place surprised me! It's actually one of the best Vietnamese vegetarian restaurants I've been to, and very comparable to homemade food (sorry grandma!). Yes, it's a bit hole in the wall, but who cares? Bun Mang Vit was absolutely delicious and highly recommended. Other dishes I tried were very good, too, like the mi xao gion (crispy noodles) and com tam (broken rice). Great variety of dishes, good portions and delicious food."}
{"text":"They might have changed their vegetarian menu or changed the owner. Not whole lot of selection and are mostly Thai style dishes instead of Vietnamese dishes like I see on yelp. A little bit disappointing. AC is not very strong. It's super hot here in the restaurant, and I was sweating. Food is fine, but have had better."}
{"text":"For the most part the food was bland.  Spring rolls overstuffed w shredded iceberg lettuce (strange) and Pad Thai was brutal. The little taste it did have was akin to unsweetened oatmeal. The Red Curry was the only dish w some flavor but unfortunately it was most just curry (very few vegetables).  This is more of a churn and burn shop as they obviously dont taste what they cook.  Wouldnt be worth it at half the price. How some can give this 3-4-5 stars is absolutely mindboggling. The only recc I can give is that you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I moved into the area recently and stumbled upon this little gem. I ordered spring rolls and chow mein to-go and man o man, it was very delicious!!! My sister couldn't even tell it was a vegan meal. I highly recommend and will most definitely be coming back. And they have delivery too!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the green curry with the accompanying brown rice.  All absolutely fantastic!  Will travel from uptown Phoenix for this food!"}
{"text":"Dirty. I went to the restroom prior to ordering and there was a giant cock roach. After which I lost my appetite. This establishment is a hard pass for me."}
{"text":"You'd think that the menu items here would be vegetarian, looking at the restaurant name. Think again. *dramatic intro*  Came here to celebrate being veg-curious with some cool folks. I'd been to the Mekong Plaza across the street and tried UnPhogettable, which offers delicious pho. I was craving something hot to soothe my throat and pho sounded perfect. I'd read in reviews that this place has two menus: an American and a Vietnamese. Wanting to order something authentic, I chose from the latter and got a pho combo with beef and chicken. Since I thought the whole menu was vegetarian, I was excited to see this option with soy meat. I also ordered cream cheese wontons as an appetizer.  Our food came in waves in the order that we ordered. My wontons were pretty good and I liked the sweet and sour sauce. The pho bowl arrived and it looked surprisingly and suspiciously like it had real beef. Then when I noticed the bone marrow/gelatin, I knew something was wrong. Thankfully, Norm saved the day by tracking down our server and asking about it and somehow he gave me the real deal. It took 15 min or so for my vegetarian pho to come out and I didn't eat much of it. It was lacking flavor, even with the addition of Sriracha.  This is why I have trust issues. Apparently, the restaurant has two sides and one serves meat. Reading the name and the menu, I didn't realize this and only found out after my snafu. I can look past things like the ambiance if the food is good, but this wasn't the case. The placemats reminded me of the 90s and there was a dead fly on the table. Like I said, I normally don't care about the aesthetics but figured it belonged in this review. I won't be back, and there are other places nearby that I'll probably try."}
{"text":"My sister is vegan, and my Ohana is all health conscious. We strive to eat as holistically, organically, GMO free, and chemical free as possible. Finding even just a good vegetarian, much less a vegan restaurant is a rarity. One that serves organic, and has reasonable prices is even harder. We found Green Lotus Vegetarian by googling for vegetarian restaurants near where my sister lives.  Our party started with only being four, and quickly expanded to being a final count of nine. The staff was amazing, and just kept adding seats! We were there for hours, part of the time spent waiting for the rest of our party, yet they did nothing but make us feel comfortable!  The pumpkin curry that we were recommended was the BEST curry I've had...EVER! We ordered a wide array of items, and EVERY SINGLE ONE was FANTASTIC!! The lemongrass soup was just AMAZING, and evoked memories of the lemongrass soup that I used to get at the Vietnamese place behind my college in Pittsburgh.  Not only was the food on par, but the Thai Iced Tea, and Coffee were also delicious!!   Out of all the vegetarian, and Asian places that I have eaten across the nation, and even internationally in my lifetime, eating here has surpassed all of my experiences!! The food was phenomenal! The service was excellent!! We opted to eat family-style, and the portions given were definitely worth your dollar!! I even have the feeling that they upgraded our portion sizes on a few of our dishes, so that everyone in our party could partake. If you are EVER in the area, don't pass up this amazing opportunity!!  Green Lotus Vegetarian is my new favorite restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to dine in here. Food was superb (we tried lots of things off the menu and they were all wonderful). Service was a little slow (it appeared there were only 2 employees running both restaurants), but very friendly. The decor is kind of depressing, but I can overlook it for the great food, would gladly dine in or take out again."}
{"text":"The green lotus is a comfortable, small family place. It's simple and definitely healthy.   The rise dish that I ordered was ok. It had vegan beef, shrimp and chicken in it. The vegan shrimp was really gummy and definitely not my type of food. The rest was pretty blend and I had to add a lot of soy sauce to make it taste like something. The waiter told me that its usual with vegan dishes. 3 stars  Then we had yellow and red curry. The red curry was surprisingly better than the yellow one. But the potatoes were not cooked properly. 3 stars  We asked them to replace the potatoes and the waiters brought some additional potatoes that were nothing I have ever seen before, very weird looking ones. We didn't eat them.   We also had 3 egg rolls as appetizer and they go for $6 which I thought is too much for only 3 small egg rolls. 2 stars.  The atmosphere was a little strange because it seemed the restaurant was a home and a restaurant since the family lived there. We saw some people coming in and out that didn't seem like they were working in the kitchen.   They also let the back door open and there was a security device which beeped every 5 seconds the entire time we were there. That was annoying.   The waitress was very calm and easy to talk to but then was replaced by someone else. Who looked like the cook of the place. 3 stars.   It's not a place I would go to again. But nonetheless a good experience. A nice family owned place."}
{"text":"This little place is something you want to give a chance to and not judge by it's decor. When we go out to eat we need to focus on the food, right? This restaurant offers brown rice, very clean ingredients and friendly kind service. When it comes down to it, those things are the most important. We tend to forget it's here, but each time we eat here we feel great, never bloated, and yet we are still full and satisfied. The food is served family style, which is nice so everyone can share. And really you can eat a little less, which is a good thing. I love this place & I'm so grateful that they offer a vegan menu in a sweet home like environment."}
{"text":"Was surprised to find that this restaurant is attached to another restaurant that serves meat. It's still nice that this one has a menu that is full vegetarian. They did have chicken, shrimp and beef, but they are all made of vegetarian ingredients.  I love the fresh vegetarian spring rolls with peanut sauce! I can get full from those, and it comes with 3 pieces! Tasty thai food, very friendly staff and reasonably priced food. They have a ridiculous amount of fake meats if that's your thing.  I loved the flavor of  my dish and presentation was nice.  Water was refilled constantly! Was happy with the price. Tons of clearly marked vegan options. It looks like a family owned business because an elderly woman served me there. Looks like someone's grandma. I like supporting businesses like this. Very hardworking, and cheerful too!   Near the Valley Metro light rail:  Sycamore & Main Street (Tri-City Stop)"}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery, the Pad Thai arrived hot, but they forgot the carrots, bean sprouts, I got a glob of noodles, yes a glob it was difficult to pry it apart. Mild taste lots of tofu no veggies as described on menu. The fresh spring roll was okay, the peanut sauce tasted mostly of soy sauce lacked peanut flavor.  $22.00 wasted live an learn"}
{"text":"This restaurant is interesting in that it shares the same building as Pho Bamboo next door. There is an open space between the separating wall and all the cooking seems to be done in the kitchen at Pho Bamboo. I stepped in for a late lunch and was the only person in the restaurant. There was no one on the Green Lotus side but a server, an older woman speaking Vietnamese, was talking on her phone on the Pho Bamboo side. I browsed at the menu while she ended her phone call and came over to seat me. She then asked \"Are you Vietnamese?\" which I replied I was not, then was handed a menu. Afterwards, looking at the menu photos on Yelp from this restaurant I realized that there were actually two menus, a Vietnamese menu and the Americanized food menu that I received. The Vietnamese menu was in both Vietnamese and English and I was a little annoyed that I wasn't given the option of both the Vietnamese and Americanized menus. After reading a few other reviews, other people that aren't Vietnamese received the Vietnamese menu so why was I excluded? Just because I'm not Vietnamese doesn't mean I don't want food just like how native Vietnamese eat at home, especially if I can read the menu!   I went with the lotus shoot salad, an item apparently on both menus. I love lotus root so I was excited to try both the namesake of the restaurant and a different part of the lotus plant. It was made in a speedy amount of time and looked excellent. It had a copious amount of crushed peanuts, with lotus shoots, cilantro, mint, whole Thai red chiles, and carrot (Just to name a few of the ingredients!). The dressing was sweet and tangy, and the salad was perched on top of a bed of iceberg lettuce. I liked the combination of flavors and textures and especially enjoyed the crunchy lotus shoots. However, on a few bites I got some thready long white pieces that were hair-like. They seemed like they were some sort of synthetic material, like something you'd pull out accidentally from the stuffing on a couch cushion or stuffed animal. By that time a different person, a young gentleman, had taken over as server, dressed in casual clothes. When he asked if everything was OK I showed him the white thready strings. He paused then said those pieces were from the process of shredding the vegetables. Even if it were a by-product of what he claimed, the chef should have made sure that those pieces would not be in the salad because when I discovered them in my salad it felt like I was chewing on hair or really fine dental floss. Not good eats.  When I got a second round of floss-like thread in my salad I decided to package everything up to go so that I would pick out all those weird funky pieces out of my salad in the comfort of my home. I showed the young gentleman the second round of thread, he looked at it and replied gruffly \"Sorry.\"   My total was a little less than $10 with tax included. It was a huge amount of food for sure, and I liked the taste of the salad, but the weird service with the menu allocation and the unwanted threads in my salad make me hesitant to try this place out in the near future. I'll give it a little bit more time before I decide to try it out again to see if things have improved.  Edit: I looked it up and apparently lotus shoot does have weird white threads when you cut it incompletely. It's still not what you would want to eat in a salad though!"}
{"text":"Ah, amazing! We got the yellow curry and pad thai delivered (fulfilled through Eat24) and it was way better than expected.   You have the choice between mild, medium, spicy, or extra spicy for each dish. We did spicy, but I wish we had done extra spicy. Didn't quite kick me in the mouth like I was hoping. Even so, the flavors were phenomenal. The yellow curry was so luxuriously creamy and rich. Wonderful balance of flavors with spices, tofu, broccoli, potatoes, and peppers. The curry was slightly sweet, so the pad thai was the perfect savory compliment. The pad thai noodles were cooked well and it had such wonderful flavors going on.   Servings are enormous. We have enough left over for two more meals or one large, indulgent meal.   Delivery took about an hour on a Monday evening. I expect it'd be longer on the weekend."}
{"text":"Excellent option.  The food was terrific with many selections that are vegan and the food quality is excellent!  Highly recommended.    Very nice, personal service.  Will be going back often."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! My husband and I try new places all the time and I seriously would eat here every day!  We had the vermicelli noodle with soy beef (recommended by our server) and the spicy basil vegetables. My only complaint was my husband put too much mint on my plate -  Extremely nice server Julie - and I recommend this place to everyone who wants to truly experience amazing flavors.  I can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"When me and my family got there it was a small place and we were the only ones in the restaurant so it's very low key. Our dinner arrived quickly. And everything was truly amazing. I would recommend this place to everyone. #govegan"}
{"text":"Ordered the Vermicelli Noodle with Soy Beef and fell in love. We also ordered the spring rolls with crisp mint and fresh veggie slivers. I highly recommend these reasonably priced, fast Vietnamese food.   I was only disappointed that the food was delivered in styrofoam and a plastic bag. There are other options."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly service. The d√©cor is a little odd and not particularly inviting, but everything else makes up for it. Well worth going to."}
{"text":"A good indication that I need to YELP---is because I am craving the food and can't wait to go back!  I shared spring rolls, green curry and pad thai with my friend along with a coconut-cinnamon smoothie with boba. IT WAS ALL INCREDIBLE!  For that, I give this restaurant 5 stars!  All my guests enjoyed their meal---including the 3 year old with us! The owner even offered to help us with the kids."}
{"text":"Pho, Hot & Sour Soup, Spring Rolls, Curry, Thai Iced Tea, Vietnamese Coffee! What's not to love about all of these vegan options with so many more! They are super friendly & affordable. We have taken our omnivore friends & they love it too!"}
{"text":"Despite the \"Vegetarian\" listing and name here on Yelp, Green Lotus markets itself as a vegan restaurant. Before you even enter the door, they have printed on their window-front: \"Vegan Cuisine,\" \"No Animal Product,\" \"No Dairy, No Egg.\" Next door to Green Lotus is Pho Bamboo, which not a veg*n restaurant. They have the same owner and once inside, the two restaurants are only separated by a partial wall, so you can walk back and forth between the two. That being said, they share the same kitchen, which is located on Pho Bamboo's side.   A group of us came here last Thursday for the Veg-Curious Night Out UYE.  This was my first time here. I did my research ahead of time so I knew that there were 2 vegan menus: 1 American menu; 1 Vietnamese menu.  Both menus are said to be 100% vegan, but the Vietnamese menu is more extensive. (I took photos of all pages on both menus; see photos.) If you \"appear\" to be non-Vietnamese, you will receive the American menu. (And believe me, you'll be missing out.) So I asked our waiter for both menus and he was happy to oblige, although it appeared that he may have been scolded by an older woman (owner?) for doing so.  She then came over and asked one of my buddies if he was Vietnamese, to which he replied no.  She appeared to try to take away our Vietnamese menus. I told her that I'd requested both menus. She just smiled and nodded her head (her English is limited), still holding out her hand out for the menus.  I held tightly onto mine, but she took the rest. Why do they have 2 different menus? The Vietnamese menu still has English descriptions for every entry, so that perplexes me. Upon further inspection, I did discover that some of the dishes in the Vietnamese menu were cheaper than its American counterpart. e.g. Com Chien Thap Cam (Combination fried rice), Com Chien Thai (Thai fried rice), and Com Chien Thom (Pineapple fried rice) are all $8.95 in the Vietnamese menu.  In the American menu, Thai fried rice is $9.95, Pineapple fried rice is $10.95, and Combination fried rice is $11.95. That's up to a $3 difference. Now in all fairness, there could be a reason. Maybe the American menu offers a larger portion, because...ya know, Americans?  I will dig deeper into this and report back.   KING EGG ROLLS $5.95 - American menu. Comes with 3 large & crispy \"egg\" rolls, filled with veggies and tofu.  It came with thin light brown/yellow sauce that did not taste like sweet and sour sauce.  Another mate had ordered the crispy Pub Wontons (Vietnamese menu), which came with a red sweet & sour sauce. I think that sauce would've been better.  The egg rolls themselves were cool, but I'm a sauce person; the sauce is just as important, if not more, for me.  GA RAM $5.95 - Vietnamese menu. Fried soy chicken appetizer.  It reminded me more of vegan shrimp than faux chicken. It had a wiggly consistency. The flavor was ok, but I couldn't get pass the texture.   CA MUOI XA CHIEN $8.95 - Vietnamese menu. Marinated soy fish deep fried with spicy lemongrass.  The dish had great flavor but the soy fish did not appear to be deep fried at all. Pan fried, maybe, but not deep fried. Also, there was no hint of the lemongrass flavor. This dish came with jalape√±os, minimal broccoli (maybe 2 pieces), green bell peppers, and onions, served with jasmine rice. Again, yummy dish, just not what I expected.  RAU THAP CAM XAO GUNG $9.95 - Vietnamese menu. Fried ginger \"chicken\" with mixed vegetables.  By this dish, I've discovered that when they say fried, they mean stir fried. Served with jalape√±os, green bell peppers, onions, and ginger. Served with jasmine rice. This dish was also very good and flavorful. I requested spice level 4 (on a 1-5 scale), but it was not spicy at all.  HOT & SPICY GREEN BEAN $9.95 w/ Soy Chicken + $2 - American menu. It's supposed to be saut√©ed in a chili paste. I requested spice level 4. It only had a hint of spice. Maybe they gave me the American spice scale instead of a real spice scale? Nonetheless, excellent dish that bursts with flavor.  It came with mushrooms, which was not mentioned in the menu description. I dislike mushrooms, so I had to pick those out, which is a shame; I hate wasting food. Served with brown rice.  VEGETABLE FRIED RICE $9.95 w/  Soy Chicken +2 - American menu. Excellent flavor in this dish as well. It comes with lots of green onions, which I love.  PROBLEMS! One of my dinner mates ordered the Vegetable Pho (Vietnamese menu) and was served REAL MEAT! How can this happen? Because as I said earlier, it shares a kitchen with its neighbor, Pho Bamboo. For this reason, I have a major problem with this establishment marketing itself as a vegan restaurant.    When vegans see the \"vegan\" label on an eatery, we eat there knowing rest assured, we'll be served a 100% animal and animal by-product free meal. That security is false at Green Lotus. Aside from investigating further, I won't return to Green Lotus unless they become completely independent from Pho Bamboo."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a great find. We were visiting Mesa, AZ from San Diego, and were looking for a vegan restaurant.  We had spring rolls, pumpkin curry, the green bean dish, and the mango salad. All of them were outstanding.  The prices were quite reasonable as well.  Now, to be clear, the cuisine is worth all the stars. The decor is done on the cheap (to say the least), but did I mention how good the food is?   Note: as you face the restaurant, you want to enter under the sign that reads \"Bamboo\". The Green Lotus Vegetarian sign is above a door that is not unlocked. Also, when you walk into the restaurant, you'll find the room extremely cold. Just walk into the restaurant far enough to turn left and walk through the open door into the other room- it's 15 degrees warmer and perfectly comfortable."}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews but I have to because this place has too many stars and it was terrible. I came here with a friend and we were both very disappointed with the quality and the freshness of the food. There was also a huge half dead roach in the bathroom on the floor, gross!!  I will never eat here again!!"}
{"text":"OMG.  OMG, OMG, OMG! I've now tried 6 dishes here, and everything is amazing.  This little restaurant shares a kitchen with a non-vegan separate little restaurant.  I think her husband cooks the non-vegan and she cooks the vegan items.  She is very sweet, and the place has a great vibe. I will be going back again, and again, and again! Oh, beware, some of her chairs are a little flimsy-but she's SUPER nice about it."}
{"text":"Cute little spot, food was delicious bursting with flavor and HUGE portions. The service was extremely friendly. We'll definitely be back when we're in town again. The tofu larb was my favorite!"}
{"text":"Love this place, best vegan restaurant in the area.  Highly recommended the spring rolls!  Always come for the pleasant service, comfortable environment and delicious Chow mien!"}
{"text":"A simple restaurant with wonderful food. Big portions and the woman who works there is so nice I want to cry."}
{"text":"Had eggrolls with side of veggies (w/peanut sauce) and a side order of garlic noodles. Eggrolls are fantastic I would eat like 30 of them. The veggies were fresh and tender but not overcooked, I did not really enjoy the peanut sauce it was very sweet and needed heat to balance it out against the soft veggies. The garlic noodles were very stuck together into a brick of noodles, I think that wouldn't be a problem probably just got stuck together in delivery. Overall tasty and I would order again thank you!"}
{"text":"Recipes from home. The new cook is very careful and creative. His plates looks very delicious. The best thing to try is the lotus salad and the bun hue. The bun hue is the spicy noodle vegan variant of the vietnamese spicy noodle soup. If you want something flavorful and yummy, get that!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery this evening. It was my first time trying food from here. I could not wait to eat the fresh spring rolls with peanut sauce. The spring rolls were okay (I prefer more mint), but the \"peanut sauce\" was disappointing. It tasted more like hoisin sauce. I did not taste any peanut flavor. The spicy basil noodles, the other dish I tried, was okay. My food arrived just 20 minutes after I placed my order online, which I appreciated. I wish I could agree with all of the other 4 or 5 star reviews. If I ever do decide to give this place another chance, I will definitely order something different than what I ordered this time and something that does not come with peanut sauce."}
