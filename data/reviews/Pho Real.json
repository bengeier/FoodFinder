{"text":"After reading some reviews on Yelp, I decided to have dinner here Friday night.  I'm a big a fan of bo 7 mon and read some good stuff from this place. 

The place is easy to find but situated in the back of a plaza.   Not the greatest location.   

So, after a 2 hour dinner and $200 lighter in the pocket, I'm still hungry.  We were a party of 9, 3 kids 6 adults. 

Two set of bo 7 mon for 3
3 orders of chicken wings - fish sauce & tamarind 
Large pho
Shrimp fried rice
2 order of seafood spring rolls

Gonna start with pho... $11.50 for a large,  eunff said.  The bowl was size of a medium anywhere else.  Amount of beef was what you will get in a mini bowl. 
Broth was ok.   

Fish sauce wings was good.  $9 for about 7 pieces.  This I don't mind.  The other flavor was so so. Would recommend the fish sauce one. 

Shrimp fried rice. .. pass.  Did not look yummy at all.  Lol

Seafood spring rolls. .. still looking for the seafood. 

And now bo 7 mon.  $45 for 3 or $35 for 2.  Bad feeling already.   Everything was average.  Nothing special... the only thing different was instead off congee it was beef soup with pasta.   We need to order extra cucumber,  they charged us $3 lol.  The sauce (mam nam) was not the greatest. 

Bill was $174... so we left $200.  

Will I be coming back... after I find the seafood in my spring rolls.  Lol

To be honest,  food was not that bad.  But definitely not worth the price.   I'm not cheap or anything... maybe I grew up eating Vietnamese in the Jane and Finch area and got used to the portions and price there. .. so everything seems expensive too me now. 

But I did have the best bo 7 mon in Montreal.   It was $45 for 2.  The most expensive bo 7 mon I ever had.  And it was worth it.   I did a review on it and it was seriously the best beef I had in bo 7 mon."}
{"text":"This Vietnamese restaurant is one of my favourites. It is a little pricier than your usual hole in the wall establishments but it is well worth it. The beef tenderloin pho is packed with ingredients, a good amount of meat, noodles and garnish. The broth is very flavourful and is the main reason I keep coming back! Very nice decor (for a Vietnamese restaurant of course) and decent service. The elder lady who usually works there is sweet and attentive. The deep fried shrimp rolls are a MUST!!! I just wish it came in a bigger portion because they are the most delicious fried rolls ever! They are tasty, super crunchy and have a dipping sauce to die for! I have yet to eat at a Vietnamese restaurant that meets Pho Real's standards for quality and highly recommend to everyone. I recently moved out of Vaughan and am seriously needing my Pho Real fix :("}
{"text":"I found Pho Real on Yelp a few months ago, something told me that I had to try it. Regardless of the fact that I live almost 40 minutes away!  I had the Vietnamese Salad Roll to start. Fresh, delicious and paired with the BEST sauce I've ever had with one of those rolls. Followed by the vermicelli with grilled pork and seafood spring roll. Long story short, I'm hooked. My husband and I have tried every Vietnamese place we can in search of something comparable...haven't found anything close. They know what they are doing and we LOVE it!"}
{"text":"Their special bun bo hue served only on weekends is amazing! Gotta try with their home made chili/lemongrass sauce"}
{"text":"This is best place for pho in Toronto. With so many pho places in Toronto. I think this the best thing I can say about them"}
{"text":"we heard from someone the cheft is a famous baker for making deserts and cakes, so we decided to give it a try, the Pho was good although it was a bit pricier than other places.  We never got to try the desserts because of some mixed up with the order, and my kids did not want to wait, so we will come back and try out the desserts next time"}
{"text":"A bit pricey but their foods are fresh and extremely delicious. Love their clay pot dishes, Spicy soup (Bun bo hue) and Banh dap thit nuong."}
{"text":"The first time I went to this place, the service was amazing. I decided to come back again this week and the service was really bad. When I  requested for service from a male server, he refused my request to do a simple task (asking for a napkin), he didn't even bother asking me l what I wanted and rudely pushed me off to another server and told me to wait. Although the ambiance for a pho restaurant is nice. The food taste and the presentation is ok."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Pho restaurant not only in Vaughan but also the GTA.  I'm Vietnamese and have grown up eating authentic Vietnamese food.  I've tried most of the Pho restaurants in the GTA and can say without a doubt that Pho Real is definitely the \"Real\" thing!  The broth is rich in flavour and the meat is truly tender (without the tenderizing chemical taste that many other Asian restaurants tend to have).  The service is exceptional!  They really cater to the needs of their customers - not like many of those apathetic attitudes that are usually associated with other Viet pho places.  I've tried many of their other dishes:  spring rolls, soft shell crab, chicken wings (fish sauce flavoured - only place I know that actually serves this dish anywhere - you would find this dish if you were to travel to Vietnam), vermicelli noodles, and of course their desserts.  Whatever you order, you need to save room for desserts because they are amazing!

Don't let their location deter you from coming to Pho Real!  It may be located admist industrial strips, but there is nothing bland about this place!  

Many have commented on the price - but you truly pay for what you get!"}
{"text":"The owners are lovely and clearly take pride in what they do. Their food is delicious; the broth is very flavourful and meat is of good quality. Frozen grapes as a pallet cleanser is a nice touch!"}
{"text":"This place offers food in very high quality, the broth of the pho is excellent. Not those that are made with MSG. It delivers a strong aroma of beef, not to mention about the taste. The pho is a must to try. The beef is smooth, soft and tender. 

\"Beef fondue\" another dish that is amazing, dip the AAA grade beef into a boiling vinegar and wrap it with rice paper and veggie, finish the wrap with anchovy dipping sauce. The blending of the vinegar and anchovy sauce gives you a surprising additive taste. It is so irresistible and I have to take one after another. The fun part is that the rice paper is dehydrated, and you have to dip it into water to soften it before making the roll.

The following are all good to try

thang long grill fish
seafood spring roll
Lemon grass calamari salad
exotic grill beef
Beef Fondue
** durian ice cream (if you like durian)**"}
{"text":"Four of us came here for dinner. The ambiance and design of the restaurant was unique and quite likable. This, of course, brought on the thought of whether the pho would really be good as trendy decor often equals catering to non-Asians which results in unauthentic food. This was our experience of Siamese Thai.
We ordered some take out as well for my girlfriend's family and 2 of her family members independently mentioned the soup base tasted very similar to the soup base used in instant noodles. Maybe the instant noodle captures the taste well. It does not bode well if they are using the same mix here though. One of our party commented that the imperfection in the consistency of the broth makes it likely that they are using a mix. I haven't had instant noodle in a while so I could not comment on that, but I definitely do not want my ravioli tasting like it was from Chef Boyardee.
I have heard that the ingredients here are fresher. If it was, I couldn't really tell. I really haven't had bad pho, and I can't say this is markedly better than any other pho I've tasted. So for us, it did not justify the premium we were paying. Our bowl was $11.75 and was only available on Friday to Sunday and was the restaurant's specialty. Other pho places might have the equivalent for $6.99 to $8.99.
My girlfriend asked for the cheque and the waiter said we pay at the front, but this meant we did not get out frozen grapes, which my girlfriend will never forgive the restaurant for.
Bottom life: Considering the premium prices and the average food, we will not be coming back here again. Pho Real was a real disappointment."}
{"text":"Pretty good Pho, definitely not the best in the area but the restaurant itself is pretty nice. That being said, I think you're paying for the decor because while the Pho is alright, paying $12 for a small with tip is a bit much. 

If you're going with people that aren't familiar with Pho it would be a good choice, otherwise the other places in the area are better in quality and value"}
{"text":"Spent three weeks in Vietnam and I feel that this is one of the most authentic and delicious places in the GTA. Friendly staff. Owner is phenomenal. Absolutely loved it. The meal was delicious. A must try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a meeting and wanted to try a local pho spot.  

Service was excellent because I was greeted immediately once I walked through the door.   They just opened so no one else was there.  They person was nice an friendly as they greeted me and sat me to my table.

Ambience was excellent.  The place look modern and well kept.  

Food was very good as I order the Pho Tai and shrimp spring roll.  They gave you plenty of herbs and beam sprouts.  The shrimp spring roll was delicious with the peanut sauce that had a little kick to it.

Overall the experience was very good and if I was in the area again someday, I will stop by."}
{"text":"I've been to this pho real many times and always have an okay stay and pho, but I had the worst experience with one of the waiters, let me remind you there is only 2... my boyfriends sister asks for a mango cheesecake and the waiter comes back with a smoothie and gets upset when she corrects him, not only that he lied to us and said there was no more after she corrected him. Later on the \"owner\" I'm guessing apologized for his behaviour even called him lazy and said he would \"make us\" a cheesecake in the back. I thought that psycho path would've been fired but I went back and noticed he wasn't... something has to be done about this man"}
{"text":"Nothing special here. The Pho is probably less than average and the service was also moderate. Probably won't come back since there's a lot of other options in the area. My girlfriend also found her vermicelli very dry and lacking taste. They can definitely do better."}
{"text":"Delish pho and padthai when we came in the first time. Came again for the second time, delish pho and average padthai. Also ordered miso marinated pork spare ribs on second vusit (main dish, NOT rice dish), nothing special. Food prices are on higher side (compared to other pho place). What was disappointing the most (`pho real` a ripoff) is the miso pork ribs.Paid $13 for 4 pieces (4 ribs bones 3inch width)!!! Again, we ordered as main dish,NOT rice dish (i.e.main dish portion should have larger portion. Isn`t that why it`s called MAIN DISH?). Overall, average taste and `extraordinary` price compared to others."}
{"text":"This is our go to pho. Clean restaurant, run by honest family who work hard. I love P5 pho and their chicken rice clay pot. Always have a good bowl of pho never been letdown."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a great pun to its name which caught my attention.

Although the price is more than any other pho places but the service they provided for us was great, the pho has a nice rich beef flavour than most of the other places."}
{"text":"Took 20 minutes for anyone to take my order, then took another 35 minutes to receive my order. I got vermicelli with grilled pork and seafood egg rolls. $11.00. It was the usual deal, didn't blow me away. Bangkok Saigon Noodle in Bradford is my usual spot and is much better than this place, and cheaper at $8.00. I won't return because I can't wait this long on my lunch break."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but it was a memorable one.

Their location isn't the most convenient or easy to find, but I managed okay. The decor inside is beautiful though.

After hearing great things about their bowl of pho, I could see what the hype was about when I ordered my very own. Although their bowl of pho is slightly? more expensive than other places, the delectable flavors of the broth make up for it. It is absolutely delicious.

They had friendly staff who were very attentive.

Looking forward to the day I return to have another bowl of pho or even something else off the menu bc I'm sure it will be delicious as well."}
{"text":"We ordered the pork belly clay pot rice,  pho and spicy noodle soup. The clay lot rice was amazing! The rice was slightly crispy and the poem belly was extremely fragrant. The soup in the pho also tastes very rich and flavourful, how're the beef was a little too over done for my taste. We needed the meal with their durian gelato which is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's pricey compared to other local favourites for Vietnamese cuisine, but fairly so, and worth it. The signage says \"Fine Vietnamese Cuisine\", so one should not expect to compare it too closely with a typical place. People who are complaining about the price are missing the details:

1. The condiments/herbs dish that came with the Pho is more premium than most places. The thai basil were clean! Did not have a single dark spot on them. The dish came with the Ngo Gai herb (Culantro) which most places don't offer because it's pricier, and a little red chili pepper which some places keep in a little container on the side of the table. 

2. The tables are clean and clutter free. You will not find that typical tray holding all the chopsticks, spoons, condiments, etc.. Even the hoisin sauce and chill sauce squeeze bottles are clean and better quality than the typical ketchup squeeze bottle. The server brings you your utensils and condiments when you order, as with any other western restaurant. I don't really care for the ramen style soup spoon, but it's nice to have. Each diner receives a small dish with condiment spoon, which is a clever touch.

3. Like others have mentioned, this would be a great place to take a first-timer who has never tried Vietnamese cuisine. You don't have to worry about freaking out your non-asian friends at a typical Vietnamese restaurant. Likewise, this place would be good for dates.

4. The washrooms are VERY clean and does not smell of urine or bleach. Enough said. Also, they are wheelchair accessible with handicap open-door buttons. Well done.

5. The Pho broth was excellent, full flavoured, not too salty, does not make me thirsty after my meal, has a slight different taste than most other places and I can't quite put my finger on it. I enjoyed it very much and was compelled to let my server know that I was pleased. He seemed happy to hear it, but at the same time his expression seemed to say \"Yeah, I'm aware we have good broth\" hahaha. The meat tastes great, had real beef flavour, and noodles were perfect, not too soft, did not fall apart in my bowl, just perfect. 

6. Speaking of the server, he made sure I was aware that the broth contained onions and cilantro, apparently some people are allergic to that stuff? So it was nice that he double checked. 

7. My wife wanted a rice dish but had difficulty deciding what to order, the server recommended the chicken and ribs meal and MAN we were glad he did. The chicken was an actual piece of chicken breast, not your typical sliced and flat pounded piece that you normally would get at any other place. The ribs were super tender and the flavour reminded me of Shanghai style soup dumplings (xiao long bao), The rice was served with a sauce (not fish sauce) and the tomatoes were actually red, very good ingredients. Oh, and the rice came with a side bowl of soup, which was much appreciated because only a few places in the GTA actually do this for rice orders!

8. The seafood spring rolls were delicious, and came with a dish of mango and red bell pepper chutney in fish sauce. Very nice touch with the angled cut on the rolls. 

9. The people who dine here are well-mannered and well-dressed (from what we saw on a saturday night). Again, this is not your typical loud Pho place. They play a nice mix of adult contemporary and jazz for ambiance. The furniture is nice, with real hardwood tables (I was surprised).

10. The mango smoothie was great! Actual mango flavour! The Vietnamese drip coffee with condensed milk was not overly sweet which is a nice change from other places. Well done. 

The bad:
Yes, there are some bad things that prevented me from giving it a perfect score:

1. My tea cup was dirty. This is unacceptable. I hope the staff diligently clean and check their dishes.

2. The menu was just printed on regular printer paper and slipped into plastic sleeves, not very impressive for a \"Fine dining\" experience. 

3. The seafood spring rolls, while tasty, were very oily. It did not come with any pickled carrots/radish, or vermicelli noodles. Overall I felt this could have been cheaper. 

4. The little black book that the bill came in had clear scotch tape all along the edge, which makes it look very old and cheap. This should really be replaced.

Overall, a good place to eat, it's pricier yes, but rightfully so. We would come back and invite our friends and family to try it at least once. Yes, I know if I just wanted a quick fix for Pho there are a handful of wickedly good places in North York, I know, but here it's a different experience and good for first-timers. It's just like dim sum places, you have grungy places and upscale places that charge a premium price, same thing. People shouldn't judge this place so harshly."}
{"text":"Was in the area and needed a quick dinner that my children would eat.  My husband found Pho Real in yelp.  It was hidden from the main road and we drove to the back of the plaza.  Very open and clean restaurant.  We got the pho and my husband got a spicy noodle soup and I had a grilled lemon grass meat dish.  The pho was okay but we've had better at other establishments and found it a bit pricy.  My husband enjoyed his spicy one that didn't look spicy at first glance.  The server forgot our spring rolls but it was okay since they were like $3/ea so we didn't need it.  Okay for being in the area."}
{"text":"Its great!
 Pho Real guys I'm not kidding 

All jokes aside, the scenes is real pleasant. Very modern looking. Ordered the beef pho, probably the best I've had in the gta."}
{"text":"Pho Real has amazing food and service! I will definitely be becoming a regular here (been twice now)...very friendly, attentive staff, food comes out quick, great portions, and clearly fresh and authentic."}
{"text":"Well, it was a strange experience. The owner, I think, who didn't have a lot of experience waiting tables, nor in English, made ordering a bit of an ordeal. Wasn't really sure if he had gotten our drink order correct when he came back with two teas (we had ordered one hot and one iced jasmine honey tea) that didn't look like jasmine, were unsweetened, and both were hot. But then as we got our food order, then came the proper teas. Um. Ok. The food was better than average quality-wise but somewhat bland. Not sure if we'd go back."}
{"text":"The food is great here, very fresh and tasty. I'd have to give 3 stars just because of general experience with the waiter and customer service. There is a waiter there who is extremely annoying. It's either you can't get a hold of him to come to your table or the opposite, he comes way too frequently to scold you for letting your kids walk around the restaurant \"unsupervised\". Wtf we supervise our kids!! It's none of his business to keep reminding us to watch our children, believe me, we did! He was just getting annoyed that there are infants and kids in the restaurant, which probably disturbed his peace."}
{"text":"The beef broth is the most delicious broth I've ever had. It was rich, tasted like it was simmered for a few days and just really tasted like true beef. The beef cuts in the noodles are also superb quality. It wasn't the type that you traditionally get that's half filled with fat - these were true beef slices. I also ordered the khao soi - it's very healthy and clean tasting. If you're expecting something super rich and creamy like sukho Thai or pai then this is not like that. This tastes like the much healthier alternative. It's still really good. I will definitely be coming back for the beef pho"}
{"text":"The place looks great. The seafood spring rolls were really good but the pho was just ok."}
{"text":"Honestly could not say enough about this place. Food quality is fantastic, atmosphere is quaint and dainty, the service is quick and you always feel welcome. Vegan options are available, (always a plus in my book) and waiters will gladly help navigate the menu. The spring rolls are my weakness, order them for take out on my way home every time. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Pho Real is not Really that Real in my Yelp Opinion.  However, I am not going to give it a horrible rating since this place is pretty friggin Nice for a Pho Restaurant and the Customer Service was on point.

However, who eats Pho with a Ramen Spoon?  Really???! Maybe I have this \"Pho Purity\" in my soul but really I think qualities of Ramen should never be combined with Pho.

The actual Pho broth was decent but nothing special. It will still cure my hangover and I would not mind coming back here but there are much better pho Places..."}
{"text":"Great service. Very clean modern decor. Food was decent but higher price then most viet restaurants. The noodles were just warm - which was the downside. However enjoyed it overall!"}
{"text":"IMHO, these guys have the best pho broth in Woodbridge/Vaughan. The noodles are perfectly done and the meat is obviously high quality - tender and delicious. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Loved the fish sauce chicken wings. 
Bun Ca - rice vermicelli bass fish fillet sour soup is great for the summer. Very refreshing."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this restaurant 3.5 stars but it is closer to a 3 due to the price and quality of the broth.

The restaurant is very nice and clean and the customer service is really good so thumbs up here. I can see why people are giving this place a good rating but this is definitely not your typical Pho restaurant. It is more fine dining with nicer ambience and higher prices.

But if you are looking for pho with good broth, this is not where you will get it. The broth wasn't oily but lacked flavour. And for a small it was $10! A small bowl doesnt you much if you are super hungry so you have to pay about $13 for a large. Overall, it was decent but don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"We used to go here all the time despite the high price.
The dishes are usually delicious and the presentation them is excellent. The atmosphere of the restaurant is above average compare to other Pho places in the area. 

But yesterday's experience stopped us from further visits.
First the lady brought out tea in mugs. I could see lints floating everywhere along with stains around handles. 
We pointed it out and she just said \"I give you different one, pour yourself!\"  No apologies.
Then she brought empty mugs which were even dirtier with black dots inside. 

We did not pour the tea for obvious reasons but she proceeded to pour it next time she came to the table.
We also asked for peppers 3 times. Twice to her and once to other server. We never saw it. It felt like we were doing them a favour eating there. 

We left without having their frozen grapes and I came home extremely thirsty because I didn't want to ask for a glass of water. She had not given us the chance to explain what was wrong. She never wanted to see the issue and seemed bothered."}
{"text":"Been to many Pho places and this place is a real stand-up. Clean, friendly staff and excellent pho, love the broth. A must try for any pho lover
You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing pho and wonderful service! Always fresh! If your a Pho fan you gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"Authentic Vietnamese food from all regions in semi fine dining setting. Unique dishes such as 7 types of beef dish, turmeric grilled fish, clay pot rice, etc. Weekend specials and unique deserts are worth a try. Restaurant is spacious, modern and clean. Service is impeccable!"}
{"text":"They get a star for just being the nicest Vietnamese restaurant I've been to. Clean inside, no sticky tables and cutlery brought to each customer.
Order:
Crispy Rice with braised pork belly and duck egg.... my son ate this so fast I got a taste of the bottom of the empty clay pot. I assume it was delicious.
We also had a pho which was very good, nice broth, perfect meat and the bean sprouts were very fresh.
Lastly we had a bun with beef tenderloin which was also inhaled very quickly.
I love the fact there are several other interesting dishes I'd like to come back and try.
Also the fact it was a Sunday before 6pm and the place was getting filled up considering it's location is a good sign.
I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I came here on boxing day with my mom and sister. We settled for this place because the two other places we wanted to go to were closed. 
We were seated immediately upon arrival and the restaurant was pretty busy. I didn't like this place mostly because of the service. Our server had a snobbish attitude and was pretty inflexible with customization. The portions here are bigger than other places and more expensive but not worth it imo. 

We ordered chicken pho and rare beef pho, both soups were light tasting and was bland. I finished my bowl not because it tasted good, but because I didn't want to waste food and money. 

My experience here was pretty mediocre and lacking. I definitely won't be giving this place another chance."}
{"text":"Decent.  Not stunning.  Clean place.  Price is relatively high.  Food is comparable to other pho places"}
{"text":"I thought this place was okay. I ordered the lemongrass chicken on rice, which included a house soup. The lemongrass chicken on rice was tasty; however, it didn't really taste like /lemongrass/ chicken at all because I only tasted soy sauce and salt. The house soup was sweet and rich in flavour, which made it taste more authentic but I'm not a huge fan of sweet broth. I also tried the Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk and this was probably the best thing I ordered. I'm a huge fan of Vietnamese coffee so I was glad that this did not disappoint. 

I'll probably come back in the future to try other items on the menu. But so far, it's a no for me on the lemongrass chicken."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and ordered Rice with lemon grass chicken. My initial choice was the bun bo hue (very first item on the specials page) but unfortunately it's only served on weekends and holidays.

Back to the rice with lemon grass chicken. Rice was dry. Chicken was slightly dry and lacking a \"grilled\" taste so many other places have. The color was darker than what you would get elsewhere probably due to the marinating sauce. Chicken was also cut into strips instead of presenting as a whole piece so it's possible you may be getting less than you should (my portion did look small). The meal also came with soup which was just some veges tossed into pho broth. 

I wasn't impressed with the meal. I may give them another try, but it would be low on my list of choices. For now, 2 stars."}
{"text":"Really nice people working there. Great food and amazing flavours. Really good service. The restaurant is really clean, chefs in the back wearing hair nets."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a gem, I went here yesterday for the first time to try out their pho, since I seen a lot of good reviews about them . I have been searching for a good pho place but haven't found one yet until this one pop up. First things first, their service was really awesome, there were two  old men that was working that time , which I believed to be the boss and relative of the business. They were both very friendly and fast and attentive , which is hard to find at many Asian restaurants or any restaurants in general. The menu is alright, the price for the food is a bit pricey. I ordered the small bowl of pho tai bo vien and my boyfriend ordered large pho tai sac and tendon. Also ordered a jackfruit milkshake. We both enjoyed the Pho, it was very fragrant and had substance to the broth. The milkshake was not good but not so bad, they just put too much milk into it that I can barely taste jackfruit. My boyfriend decided to order another dish cause he was happy with the service and also the food. He ordered the bun thit nuong and cha gio. That is noodles with fried spring roll and BBQ meat. It was good but only slight problem was the meat ratio to noodles was not that much. We will definitely come back to this location for pho."}
{"text":"For the price, its good food. Very authentic Vietnamese. They have alot of variety on the menu. As do most Vietnamese places. Staff was very helpful and thankful. Had the tenderloin lemongrass w/ rice vermicelli. And springrolls. Great.  Becoming a regular spot."}
{"text":"It has the real taste of pho but price is way too high."}
{"text":"The brothers don't mess around here. Pho is all about the broth and they slow simmer for hours to extract the full complement complement of flavors and aromatics.

So you got the foundation covered

Now add Farm fresh vegetables as the toppings and you are almost there

Enjoy the beef tendon and the real deal is sitting in front of you

They also offer complimentary jasmine tea

I love their Khao Soi special and creamy bowl

Enjoy the large and crispy rolls as an appetizer with a nice side of mango and pepper cubed slaw

For the rivers at the table they have many crispy rice dishes to enjoy

These guys rock and it's a family favourite"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. 
Try the shaken beef and the beef salad for appetizer. Been there for lunch twice and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Great Pho, ordered take out. Was ready fairly quickly. Servers and owners were very fri madly and helpful with suggestions. Offered a drink while I waited as well. All food was fresh and delicious... had veggie spring rolls, yummy.. pho was great, and tamarind wings were a hit. Definitely the best pho in the neighbourhood. Hit the spot for a rainy day!"}
{"text":"Great spot for pho! Everything we ordered was fresh and delicious. I'm super picky about where I get my pho from- especially the broth. If the broth isn't good, then the whole meal is a fail for me. Pho Real is a great alternative to my regular place that's mins away from my place, and I'll definitely come back if I'm in the area and I got a pho craving. At the end of our meal my friend, who was visiting from Italy, was googling places where he's from to figure out where he'll be able to get pho again cause he loved it that much!"}
{"text":"Atomosphere: hidden at the back of a plaza, very well decorated restaurant, service is superb, everyone is very nice 
Food:
1. Bun Bo hue: the broth was so flavourful, very authentic, we got the special for an extra 2.00, there was cha tom, cha cua, and cha
2. Tamarind chicken wings: a tad disappointed, the wings were little over cooked, and sauce was a little too salty
3. 3 style beef vermicelli : they had \"Bo dun, Bo sate, Bo la lot\" I'm a huge fan of Bo la lot but it was way to dry here, and same goes for Bo dun, the Bo sate was very yummy. Decent portion size, everything was fresh

Price 
1. 8.00-11.00
Overall : Although, a bit pricey for a Viet restaurant, I love the service here, so I'll definitely be back, their restaurant is unique with French desserts and homemade che for sale."}
{"text":"I am probably going to get some hate from giving this place an OK score. After reading so many rave reviews and having my very own friends all jumping in joy upon hearing that we will be dining here. I really wanted to love this place, everything from that Asian-inspired-ghetto-90s-high-end decor (think chrome and stone) to that Italian pizza oven in the backdrop that's concealed and used as a shelf for miscellaneous junk. Heck! They even got tennis balls on the bottom of chairs to protect that precious tile floor. Then comes the fancy food with their 5/7 course tasting meals, sirloin beef and tons of unfamiliar/unheard of Viet specials. Yes, this is Vietnamese cuisine dining at it's finest!

We shall dive right into it then! The beef broth is decent. It's made from scratch for sure as only made from scratch can be so murky. I guess someone forgot to mention to them not to boil bones on high heat. Anyhow, I appreciate the effort but just because someone makes it from scratch doesn't always equate to deliciousness. Overall, it lacks depth and complexity but it is beefy though. The noodles are just a touch overdone but it's not a deal breaker. The beef is fantastic! Way above and beyond the quality of most Vietnamese restaurants. Overall a hardy bowl of noodle soup with a weak homemade stock.

Someone had order a hotpot rice with ribs dish. The ribs are tender fall-off-the-bone, good flavours but again lack depth. The rice is negligible and wasn't done properly for sure. It lacked the crispiness and caramelization that defines this dish. There's no way you can make this dish in under 5 minutes as it typically takes 20-25 minutes to make a proper one and there are no shortcuts.

Last but not least the price. I know this is Vaughan and this is catered to the wealthier crowd but at nearly $12 for a medium size pho(compared to others) it is costly.

There are so many other options for pho in Vaughan I am not sure why one would come here but I guess for those looking for finer(price wise) things in life this is your calling."}
{"text":"I live just down the street from this place, and so wanted to try it largely for the novelty of having a restaurant so close.  I wasn't expecting much from this nondescript place in an industrial plaza - but I was pleasantly surprised!

We got a large beef tenderloin pho and some crispy (deep-fried) seafood roll appetizer type things. The appetizer was tasty, and not overly greasy. More importantly, the all-important pho broth was very deep and rich in flavour, with a pronounced aroma of... five spice, I think? Anyway, it was excellent.

The prices were higher than I was expecting - 9.50 for a small pho, 11.50 for a large. That said, the quality seemed to justify the cost, especially compared to the Pho place at Vaughan Mills. This was definitely better.

They also have a selection of banh mi. I did order the pork belly sandwich, but they didn't have any. So I got an extra roll in my appetizer order!

Anyway, if you like pho/Vietnamese cuisine, would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pho broth was super murky and lacked flavour, had too much MSG in it
Braised pork belly was overly dry, the egg was overcooked, and rice was too burnt
Prices were too high and we weren't full after we ate
Bun Bo Hue has no beef in it WTH?
Really disappointing."}
{"text":"My family loves Pho and we have tried many many Pho restaurants. This place is really just so so in terms of flavor and the price is 30% more expensive than other Pho restaurants for smaller portion."}
{"text":"Food was decent - portions were very small compared to the price point... (actually, I'd say this was the most expensive Pho I've ever eaten - especially for the portion size!)

I LOVED the frozen grapes at the end - I never had that before, and do freeze my grapes now all the time as a dessert.  What a GREAT idea!"}
{"text":"I saw the yelp reviews and had to try this place. It caters to a different crowd than your usual viet resto. The prices are on the higher side and they offer some unique items. I decided to go with the 5 styles of beef option. Its basically beef prepared in 5 different ways but to be honest, 3 items were grilled versions of beef. It came with a bunch of veggies, rice paper wrap, and hot water to roll your own wraps. It was very good and tasty. I never had this before in a viet resto and it was enough food for two people with moderate appetites. There is also a 7 course version that is much bigger in portion size. 
The atmosphere and decor is modern and very clean. I like how everything looked new compared to the older viet restos. The service was also very good and is expected with the higher price points. 
Overall, if your looking for viet but dont want the grundgy, old, lack of service viet restos, this is a solid option. 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"It pains me to rate Pho Real A-OK.  I even wonder if my perception is wrong, cause there have been so many 4 and 5 starred reviews.  Well, I ought to call a spade a spade.  The Lemongrass Chicken on Rice (lunch $10) was just okay.  The meat was quite tender, but the taste seemed \"not lemongrass\", but soy sauce+sugar+salt.  Seriously, the flavors shocked me, too.  

Maybe I blame myself for not ordering a pho."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. While I liked the food and I liked the fact that they offered more than just the traditional Vietnamese places I hesitate to say the price is worth it. But I don't think it's overpriced either. We got pho and the braised pork belly with egg and rice. While the pho tasted really good and so did the pork belly, the pork belly portion could have been bigger. And even though the pho was good I know many places that make an amazing pho and while I like the fact they offer the pork belly and it's something different, I wouldn't say it's craaaazyyyy good especially being 12 dollars (which is high for a casual Vietnamese restaurant). I liked the frozen grapes it's a nice touch:) I would go back if I was okay to spend the money and the location is convenient since there aren't any good pho restaurants down my street."}
{"text":"Finally!! There's an authentic pho restaurant close by to home!! My family and I used to travel all the way from Vaughan to Jane/Wilson area just to eat pho because all the pho around this area was lacking -_- 

My parents - born and raised in Vietnam - are SO picky with their pho. They were shocked to be paying $11.50 for a large bowl of pho here, BUT the food was so authentic that it justified the price. Another reason why it's worth every penny is the broth is clear and NOT full of fat. 

TIP: Try the BUN BO HUE here! This dish was just PERFECT - full of spices & flavour!! If you don't like it too spicy, you can tell them to make it less spicy."}
{"text":"Came across this place when we were shopping in the area.

It's got the usual pho fare, as well as an interesting variety of combinations I haven't seen before. In particular they had clay pot rice, which I haven't seen (or noticed) before in a pho place.

The service was very friendly and attentive. Prices were not out of the ordinary in either cheap or expensive and portion sizes were decent too.

If in the area and you have a craving for pho I would say this place is worth checking out.

It's located facing a side street, so when you arrive it's in the plaza facing the main Street, it's just tucked away behind. So make sure to drive around the plaza to locate it first"}
{"text":"Great pho.  Broth is rich and sweet.  We had the beef and chicken.  Beef is for sure the better choice but the chicken was great too


A little more $ than some of the other pho places around, but the quality of the ingredients is way better.  Well worth the extra dollar or two!!


I'd eat here again anytime

Saturday lunch."}
{"text":"First off, is this restaurant phoreal? Lmao see what I did there? ;)

My parents must've heard really great things about Pho Real because we drove all the way from Mississauga to Vaughan. 

Pho Real used to be an Italian restaurant because it still says \"italian restaurant\" on the side of the restaurant. However, that's not important. This Vietnamese restaurant is modern and clean which is great. I liked how the servers will hand out all the utensils because who knows how many people touch the utensils that are already out at typical Viet restaurants. The only negative is that their pricing is pretty high. A small bowl of pho is ~$9 where you can get an XL at many Viet restaurants.

The majority of us ordered their bun bo hue special and their pho. I can't handle spicy food at all but for some reason I decided to order the bun bo hue. Holy, did I die! My lips and throat were on fire, and my nose was running like crazy. The meats were soft but I felt it was lacking vermicelli. It was hard for me to enjoy my meal because it was so spicy...but I knew it tasted yummy. I got to try a bit of the pho and it was really good! The broth was delicious and the meat was soft. 

Next time if I'm in the area I'll order pho instead haha."}
{"text":"I actually found this place randomly via a google search for pho places and the name of this restaurant really caught my eye lol, so we decided to try it! This place really exists, PHO REAL.. It's a pretty nice and clean restaurant. I ordered my usual pho order - rare beef pho with an avocado shake. A little pricier but the quality of the meat I would say is pretty good. The avocado shake was yummy with good avocado taste. They actually have pretty interesting menu items too like 7 courses of beef that comes with special beef salad, beef fondue, shaken beef, grilled beef sausages, beef wrapped in betel leaf, beef grilled with satay sauce, and beef pasta soup (all in one sitting!).  The owners there are super awesome as well. They were supposed to close at 9. My friend and I were unknowingly chatting 30 minutes past their closing time but they did not even kick us out. To top it off I lost something important there and they kept it for me until the very next day for pick up. I would definitely come back one day to try more of their menu items. Thank you pho real!"}
{"text":"this little vietnamese restaurant beside nails at anthonys is targeting more towards western clients. it is not authentic but still good for what it is. i dont like how they serve their pho with ramen wooden spoons, i dont see the point in that. my dad had their bun cha ca and he says there was very little cha ca in it. i like how they give you frozen grapes at the end of your meal. i probably wont return here as being in vaughan and so close to toronto, there is so many better restaurants for pho but after getting your nails done at anthonys if ur really hungry and cant wait for food then this place should hit the spot. this place is also quite over priced, as mentioned earlier, they are targeting more towards western clients and not vietnamese clients. so the prices for pho and vietnamese dishes are higher than what you would find at a shabby delicious vietnamese restaurant in toronto. ive experienced better."}
{"text":"This place has the best Pho! Authentic and delicious! FYI - they make their own in house ice cream. My favorite is the Pho, chicken wings, beef salad and durian ice cream!"}
{"text":"Good resto for pho soup. Wish they would have put some vegetables in my soup. Service was amazing. Loved the frozen grapes."}
{"text":"My all time favorite and best pho stop I've ever been to. Consistently great food, top friendly service and a chill ambiance. Very clean and quiet place. They probably do a lot of take out as the phone doesn't stop ringing. I prefer to dine in when I can but have ordered takeout a few times and everything was just as good just in a take out container."}
{"text":"If looking for cheap viet food then not the place but if you want something with quality and don't mind paying a little extra then this is the place to go.  The pho and other typical fare is good but try some of their creative options like the spareribs. My go to place on the north end of Toronto."}
{"text":"Just ate at phoreal! I ordered the pork belly stone pot dish and split the exotic beef platter with a buddy, also had the seafood spring rolls. Food was delicious:

Spring rolls- one of the tastiest I've ever had. 
Pork belly stone pot- very delicious (but when is pork belly not), especially with the fried duck egg.
Exotic beef platter- fun to eat and all the sauces were really good. 

We finished off the meal with an iced coffee with condensed milk, the durian cassava cake, and a scoop of durian ice cream. I highly recommend all of them.

The only reason it gets four stars is because I thought the portions should be bigger."}
{"text":"Best pho I've ever had! Always come here even though I live downtown Toronto ! Very nice staff and a nice modern pho spot! Highest recommendations"}
{"text":"They do have a very delicious broth and the dishes are authentic Vietnamese. However I did find that the spring rolls were very greasy. The staff were attentive, definitely value for your money."}
{"text":"Like others have mentioned, this isn't your average pho place which might not be a good thing. It's cleaner and nicer, but the food doesn't match and it's more expensive than your typical pho spot.

I had:
- Beef Pho: good but lacks the pungent, flavour-packed broth of a place like Pho Tien Tranh
- Chicken Fried Rice w/ Salad: the rice was great, but not worth $14. Also, the \"green\" salad wasn't very green...it came with fruits and I'm not a big fan of sweet and savoury.
- Tamarind Chicken Wings: a definite pass. The wings were overcooked and dry."}
{"text":"Just okay. Maybe it was just what I had ordered. I tried the lemon grass chicken with rice and it was way too salty with a hint of sweetness. Not a good combination."}
{"text":"This place is extremely over rated, the food was marginally above average at best, the cashier is incompetent of splitting bills ended up charging us 1 dollar extra. The server was sassy, and the service was tortoise like, it took like 30 minutes to get my pho (we were only one there), I will not recommend this place to anyone whatsoever, I do not understand the hype behind this place, you failed once more Yelp, SMH"}
{"text":"I came here with Jennifer K organizing a UYE. overall, i was really impressed by the experience and quality of ingredients. That's the issue with most pho places  - it comes down to the flavour of the broth and quality of the ingredients. If you screw those up - you might as well pack up. But Pho Real did a great job. Extra points for having Durian Icecream homemade!"}
{"text":"Very nice place.

good food!

very different from the typical Vietnamese restaurants!"}
{"text":"Expensive for a pho place. The food itself wasn't bad but it wasn't worth the price. Theres better in this area. 

You can tell you're paying extra for the good looking decor and plates"}
{"text":"Solid pho spot, little more expensive than downtown but that's Woodbridge. Fast service!"}
{"text":"Clean, modern, and excellent service.  Food above average with slight twist.  Price kind of high for VNmese food.  Dessert is ordinary but obscenely priced even higher than the Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons.  I'm sure that's why place is virtually empty on Sat 1pm."}
{"text":"We love the pho here! The service is pretty amazing too; I drive 20 minutes just to pick some up and there are 4 other pho places within walking distance of me."}
{"text":"I heard great things about \"Phoreal\" restaurant so decided to try.

Atmosphere (*****)
Taste: Very authentic (******)
Portion: Large = Med in silimar Vietnamse restaurant (***)
Service: Friendly and attentive (*****)

Im ok with paying premium but ... it would be better if I was not already feel hungry, right after the complement desert"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Pho Real and I have to say we were really impressed. 

We were greeted the second (literally) that we walked in the door and shown to a table. The restaurant was bright, nicely decorated (quite contemporary) and very clean.

The server was extremely friendly and far more attentive than at the average Vietnamese restaurant.

We ordered 3 dishes and 2 drinks and they were delivered in pretty good time. The iced coffee with condensed milk was one of the best we've had, and we've tried MANY. The fresh lemon juice with soda and sugar was also very good. 

I had the crispy rice claypot with beef tenderloin, lemongrass and sesame. It was served with pickled daikon, carrot and cauliflower on the side. It was delicious. The rice was nice and crispy on the bottom, the beef was very tender and tasty and there was quite a bit of onion and scallion oil as well.

My husband had the pho with tendon and tenderloin. The broth was delicious and there was plenty of protein added. They advertise that the pho is made the traditional way with a very slow cooked broth and that was evident in the taste.

Our son had the pad Thai. It was one of the best he's ever had. It tasted very authentic with just the right balance of salty, sweet, sour and spicy. The noodles were cooked perfectly.

The washrooms were very clean and well-kept.

The prices are a bit higher than most Vietnamese restaurants in the area, but I'd say the food is well worth it.

We will definitely be going back to Pho Real in the near future to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Came here last minute with a friend during my lunch break - I must say that I am quite impressed with the quality and flavours of my order! 

I ordered the Bun Bo Hue, which is only available from Friday to Sunday. It came out really quick, despite it being lunch rush time (another yay!). This restaurant actually provided the purple cabbage that not a lot of restaurants do for bun bo hue (well... the restaurants that I've been to, anyway) and she even did a quality check which is really out of the way for a pho restaurant! But back to the bun bo hue... the broth was amazing and there were tons of meat! This was just perfect for the rainy day :) 

My friend ordered the pho and she was surprised with how good it tasted! I even had a sip of the broth too and I have to agree LOL Next time I come back I'm going to try the pho! 

It also isn't like a typical pho restaurant where you write down your order on paper, you have to place your order with the server. This also probably isn't even a big deal, but I'm going to say it for review purposes but we were provided with ramen spoons instead of the traditional spoons you'd see at pho restaurants LOOL. 

Pricing though........... I dont know, $11 each for a small bowl of Bun bo hue and pho? You can get 2 small bowls of pho elsewhere for the same price. The quality is still there, but there's still a lot of other restaurants with the same quality for a lot cheaper. 

Overall, I'd recommend this place if you are really craving some pho and don't mind splurging a bit lol"}
{"text":"we are always in search of great Vit food and were looking forward to eating here. We wanted to like this place so much but could not. We arrived at 6:30 pm on a Saturday and it was empty, but the waiter rushed us over and over to order, just told us to order 2 orders of each spring roll appetizers \"bc they are soooo popular\", he didn't realize we were asking about other items. He actually attempted to force us to order what he wanted!! we told him no, then we ordered our mains and again he rushed us, told us to eat this or that, did not care what we wanted. food came out and some of the flavours were great - fish sauce chicken wings and bun ca the soup ones. You can skip the soft shell crab and spring roll appetizers , was blah and wrapped by the cheap rice paper. He advertised the restaurant as \"very special and totally different and better than the usual Pho Day Bo\" etc were his exact words. Why did he assume we don't like the usual authentic Vit food, how presumptuous of him. So we don't care for the \"special\" spin of Vit food if it wasn't great and they were nothing special. You can also skip the pork belly rice and bun Ba Mau, also nothing special. The dish I got I liked, the mi kho beef, the dry egg noodle with spicy beef, served in a sauce. The top layer had sauce and it was good but 2/3 of the noodle under were totally dry and bland, so I asked him for some more sauce. He said no (??!), his exact words were \"the cooks in the kitchen are too busy now with the other tables and don't have time to make you that sauce\" - hilarious! Never in our lives have we heard of such a response. Yes there were other tables now but what?! we politely said ok, and pushed the dish aside. Guess he saw it and felt bad so he sent some more sauce at the end after the noodles are cold. How unfortunate. We didn't even bother with dessert which looked interesting and left. We will never ever go back there and would never recommend it. And I was so proud of the thought do someone trying to heighten vietnamese food - it's not quite there yet and pricey, not worth the hit and miss flavours, rude service and remote location."}
{"text":"the food is great. their customer service is trash. It was around 8 and there were maybe 4 other cutomers in the restaurant. Went there with 3 families including myself and asked if we could combined the tables. The server said no, \"they arent like mandarin where we can move tables anywhere you want\". We asked if its possible to put chairs on the end of the tables and he insisted our families with multiple children would have to sit separately. One of the children ran near him while he was serving and he gave the child a stare and starting shaking his head in frustration. Very rude describing the options as well. I loved the food but dont step outta line with this particular server."}
{"text":"Fine Vietnamese cuisine restaurant. It is not the typical Vietnamese restaurant that you would just go for a quick lunch. Everything is very nice about this restaurant from the environment to the foods. The menu includes authentic Vietnamese dishes that is hard to find at other restaurants, for example, Bun Ca (fish noodle soup), Thang Long style Bun Ca, Clay Pot Rice, etc... We tried the Bun Ca, Pho, Clay Pot Crispy Rice with Pork Belly, and the other one with Vietnamese Miso Pork Ribs. They all were very delicious, except Pho that I think it would not be the best I had but it is not bad. Pho broth is decent compared to their other dishes. 

Regarding service, since it is a fine restaurant, the service is excellent. The servers took the time to explain the menu and provide recommendation. The washroom is so clean and smell very pleasantly with the smell of lime spray. 

Overall, I will come back and highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"What a great pho restaurant. Honestly the best I've been to.

We've been here twice and both times the level of customer service has been amazing. They're always watching to see if you need more tea and very friendly when taking your order. Plus you get these frozen grapes as a healthy desert after your meal!

I had the Pad Thai which was fantastic! The onion slices were a bit big. But flavour wise it's amazing and the tofu and egg and chicken is delicious. Perfect amount of tamarind.

Also the ca phe su da, Vietnamese iced coffee was the absolute best I've ever had. Like I'd happily drive to Vaughan again for that stuff.

As far as I know everyone else had an awesome meal. So it was great. Would keep coming here 10/10"}
{"text":"The waiter keep asking and pushing us to order while we just settle down. and after the meal, the waiter pushing us to leave.  which i don't like this kind of services at all.

for the price... hmmm $11 for a small size pho? to me it is abit pricey.  Somewhere else can be cheaper and bigger size.  but the noodles and soup are pretty good. 

For the dessert, always free for frozen grapes."}
{"text":"I just have the most expensive Pho in my life at Pho Real.

Seriously, $11.50 for a large which is the size of medium else where? 

But the quality of the ingredients, the care they put in preparing their dish, the taste, the depth of the broth, the texture of the noodles: well worth the price they are charging! The sliced tenderloin was thick and the taste of beef was intense.... 

I though was disappointed with the Grilled Chicken Banh Mi ($8.50). I love the side salad which is a mixed salad with romaine, mango, pickled shallot, cherry tomato and pomegranate. The chicken though was way way too saucy and tasted more like it was deep fried.

Love the dessert selection which includes dessert with french influence and house made durian gelato! Durian Gelato made in house?!! I would just come back to try that!!

And of course I am eyeing the 7 Courses of Beef Menu 2 person for $38 or 3 person for $45. Grilled Fish (rainbow trout) for $18. I guess I need to bring a Yelp friend or 2.

Service and decoration are both pleasant and enjoyable. Definitely a more refine Vietnamese dining experience!

I will be back Pho sure!"}
{"text":"yummy yummy! Love pho real and they have Good viet coffee as well! I love the clay pot rice with.smoked sausages"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I went here for lunch while working in the area. 

Order: 2 pieces vegetable spring roll, Pho beef tenderloin and boneless brisket size small

Spring rolls were amazing, much bigger than I was expecting, you really get 4 pieces. You can tell they put effort into those.

Pho was fantastic. Beef was tender, broth was well seasoned and add-ins were perfect; sprouts, mint leaves, lime, chilli pepper, house hot sauce. Portion size was large too, I came in with a big appetite and the small was perfect.

Will gladly dine here again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The inside is really nice considering it's Vietnamese food. It's nice enough to take a date to. That's got to be worth something. The prices are higher than any other pho spot I've seen though. It's still cheap compared to most other cuisines. I got the pho with tenderloin and beef balls. It was pretty decent although although not the best I've had. The bean sprouts and whatnot they give you are pretty fresh. That's a big plus since I find a lot of places give you fresh ones mixed in with wilting/old sprouts."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a new go to place for pho that would be nearby to home but there hasn't been many good options over the last few years. However, I stumbled onto this place when doing a general quick search and I am very glad I did. The location is a little hard to find if you don't have the exact address as it's not visible from Weston road. 

I had item P7 which was a beef, tendon, tenderloin and beef ball pho. A large is very pricey at $11.50 which felt more like a medium and even the durian smoothie was $4.5 which is about a buck more than the average price give or take.

Though it was pricey, I must say that both items I had ordered were very tasty. The broth had a lot of flavour yet I did not find myself very thirsty at the end of my meal which would generally mean there wasn't as much MSG. The meat had a lot of flavour, the beef balls actually tasted like beef balls unlike many other places and lastly, the tendons were very soft and melted right in my mouth. The only thing is that the noodles were very soft and not to my liking as I've grown to be use to a more firm. The durian smoothie here is properly my new favorite as many Vietnamese tend to use way too much ice leaving very little taste of actual durian.

If you live within the city of Vaughan or even close by, I would definitely suggest giving it a try."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. Tucked away in a commercial  complex it is a welcome gem to be explored. 

Service was great with friendly staff. Menu has lots of options. 

Food was very good, very authentic and generous in portion size. My wife had the CP2...clay pot within was crispy rice, braised ontario pork belly, Chinese sausage and duck egg....sooooooo  good.

I had rice, vermicelli, and beef 3 ways....sausage,  betel leaf wrapped beef and grilled beef. So awesome as well.....

Highly recommend this place....not too busy so great response and attention."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with a group. One of the people in our group is Vietnamese and recommended Pho Real. The interior is definitely nice and because it's located in a plaza, there's plenty of parking. We ordered the pan fried soft shell crab to share. I ordered a small pho with beef tenderloin, beef brisket, and beef balls. The soft shell crab was tasty but quite expensive. It came with a mayonnaise sauce that I didn't try. The pho came with fresh Thai basil and crisp bean sprouts. It also comes with tiny scissors. I used them to cut the basil, but that's probably not what it's for. The ramen spoon was definitely out of place. I thought the pho was really good. The beef was good quality and the flavor of the broth was not overpowering. It's a bit pricey for pho, but the quality is good. I liked that the menu suggests how to eat pho. \"Before you put anything else in the bowl, taste the broth first!\" Take that, Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is on the more gourmet side so don't be shocked at the pricier menu. It's evident that their meats are of higher quality and the decor is much nicer and cleaner than usual pho restaurants so I don't mind paying a little more. 

They also have quite an extensive menu ranging from pad thai, to rice dishes, to pho and beyond. I always like to start with their seafood spring rolls, it's nothing like I've seen before and the fish sauce that accompanies it is amazingly unique. 

If you're a fan of durian they also have amazing durian ice cream! Only thing I would say they need to improve on is their service. Some of their dishes can be very salty but most of the time you are given the sauce on the side and control how much you would like to pour in. I would say it's possible to be in and out within an hour so a quick eat is definitely possible."}
{"text":"A hidden gem of the amazing Vietnamese cusine. Unparallel taste, very clean, superb service."}
{"text":"Flavour.
Flavour.
Flavour.

The Pho broth is all about the flavour.  
It is the Best tasting Pho broth I've tried.  They slow cook the broth for 10 hours."}
{"text":"I consume my fair share of pho; probably 4 - 5 times a month. But after fluctuating through a variety of pho restaurants from Brampton, Mississauga, and Newmarket all in pursuit of that one special place - I finally feel like I've found my 'go-to' pho restaurant. Pho Real is the place you go to if you're looking for that 'feel good' 'just like Mom makes it' soup. Location wise, it's kind of tucked away in a plaza that unless you're a regular in the area, you would be completely unaware of. The atmosphere doesn't compare to many of the other pho restaurants I've frequented in the past. It's bright, airy, nicely decorated and very well kept. We were allowed to sit wherever we felt like, and the service was great. Getting to the fun part: the pho. The broth is so unbelievably favourable, yet the colour of it is that beautiful, clear colour that you wanted expect from a soup of that nature; you could truly taste the amount of time and effort that went into perfecting it. The meat isn't fatty in the slightest, either. My only major quip is the portion size. As many other's have commented on, in comparison to other places, the large bowls would be comparable to a small or medium at other restaurants. It is, however, a bit pricey. Typically, my boyfriend and I can eat pho for under $20.00, but by the time we've both ordered two large bowls of pho $9.00 - $11.50 and the seafood spring rolls ($5.50), we're looking at a bill of about $30.00 before tipping. Portion sizing and cost aside, this still remains to be my new number one place. I can't wait until we go back again."}
{"text":"Really good Pho - the broth tastes like they use more beef bones than just seasoning.  The Bun is also very good will definitely be back when in Vaughan."}
{"text":"This place is big and decently clean which looked promising but the overall experience did not impress. First impression the setting looks decent, it was bright inside with a lot of natural lighting. 

The service was a little lacking, first the server seem to have a hard time understandijg English. Which was ok for me since I did not have any food allergies. I kept on asking for hot water and  I kept on getting ice water. But there was another customer that ran into the kitchen telling them  no peanuts... that is for critical. 

In terms of food, the pho and the curry noodle dish was a little lacking of flavour and ingredients. I have tried other places that seem to offer a bit more. 

Not sure if I would be coming back to this place. Still feel a little mixed."}
{"text":"Last time I was here, I went with my parents and siblings. Decor is nice which is what you are paying for. Food was good but on par with other Vietnamese restaurants. Their 7 beef was double the price of the 7 beef elsewhere. The service was incredibly slow. I was expecting better service with the price tag. It is still a good price for dinner but not for vietnamese food since most restaurants are so well priced and quick."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Vietnamese food and I'm spoiled because I get some of the best in Chinatown NYC. So when i was looking for a meal in Vaughan Ontario I saw the reviews on Yelp for Pho Real and I figured I'd give it a try.  
This place does not disappoint. The owner is from South Vietnam and he told me everything is made to order with no advanced preparation. 
I started with the mango salad which had grilled shrimp. The mango was fresh and firm and it was dressed with a delicious rice wine vinaigrette. Moved in next to miso braised spare ribs with a side of crispy rice. Now, I love pork and eat it in every way imaginable but these ribs were seriously outer worldly. Perhaps close to a religious experience. I've never eaten Asian style ribs that tasted so good. 
In my conversation with the owner we both agreed that Vietnamese cuisine is more simple than other Asian cuisines. Less sauce and more flavor. The owner beamed about is specialty which is the Pho aka soup. I asked for a bowl and he said \"you have too much food already\" which brings me to my final point. This place does not skimp on the portion sizes. 
So I'm leaving here wanting more ...Pho. I'm in Toronto for two more days and another meal at Pho Real is probably in the cards as it should be for you."}
{"text":"Probably the best tasting pho I've ever had in terms of quality. Well worth the $12 for the large. The size is equivalent to any 'Large' I'm most establishments. The meat quantity was generous though. As other reviewers have stated the quality of meat is off the scale in terms of pho. Also I don't know if they marinated the meat prior to putting it in the pho but it has a very unique taste, I can only compare it to the sweet ginger/soysauce marinade of Korean pork hock. Also the broth was an incredibly rich dark brown colour and a rich flavour to match. It was on the saltier side but if you're making such a rich broth I guess that's kind of the drawback. The broth had a rich herbal and long cooked bone taste. Also had the ice coffee w condense milk. It was very good but didn't have that strong Vietnamese? coffee flavour. The coconut juice was very fresh."}
