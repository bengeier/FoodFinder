{"text":"Located in a small stripmall near the North East corner of Southern and Central Ave. Is this small buffet. When you enter, you have walk down a small walk way and then are met with a cashier who takes your drink order and counts the number of people in your party. You'll then claim your table and serve yourself. All the usual hits and misses of the average Chinese Buffet are here - none really stand out in all honesty. 

They are all pretty average and then came 'the incident'...

I'm still traumatized by it. Seriously I am... I went there and it felt like any other time. I had gotten a chicken dish of somekind. i don't really recall. and I started eating it and it had a very odd taste. I didn't know what it was, it was like chicken... but not really. I then started to eat the rest of it and then I saw different bones that I have NEVER found in chickens before. I couldn't even identify which part of the chicken it was and the meat was very tough and then it hit me.... THAT WASN'T CHICKEN!!

I almost threw up right then and there! I barely made it in time to go to the bathroom and vomit what I had eaten of my faux-chicken. Now I have NO idea what the hell it was that I ate. I tried to ask the cashier and she insisted it was chicken, but then she reluctantly said that it wasn't and when I demanded my money back she quit talking and wouldn't say exactly what the hell it was! 

The owner came out and started yelling at me and started yelling in Spanish (there is nothing quite like Spanish in a thick chinese accent!) and wouldn't stop even when I told her that I don't speak Spanish and then I realized she wasn't yelling to communicate with me, but with the other patrons who were starting to look at their own food with concern. I got my money back and bolted out of there and have NEVER gone back!!"}
{"text":"Went here with Rand H. on there opening day and its OK for a $4.99 buffet. The value is there but it does not measure up to most of the valley Chinese buffets. Some of the dishes were good ,like the crispy fish and some kind of mystery meat that was labeled fried fish but was not fish . Any way not to bad of a buffet for only 5 bucks."}
{"text":"It's near my house and cheap at $5.95 drink included all day. You have to pick and choose what time of day you visit to get the best food. Right at opening time and around dinner time the food is usually fresher (makes sense) but otherwise I can't complain. It's not gourmet but you're won't get sick eating there either. Oh and they have GOOD ice cream and sherbet plus their beverages include good quality green iced tea. 

My number one annoyance with this place is they only have one server it seems and she does all she can to avoid eye contact so you don't ask her for drink refills. My number two annoyance is their high chairs, they are very very old school (just plain old really) and I have yet to find one with straps that are secure. Not a good thing for someone with a squirmy toddler."}
