{"text":"4 stars.... Not for service or for ambience but mostly for the largest selection of Jamaican products in the area.  For the most part it's clean, and they are always updating things, and moving things around.  The fish market area can give the store a smell, as expected.  You choose the fish and they will take the scales off for you on the spot if you so desire.  There are bags of chicken feet, legs, thighs, breasts, or turkey neck, etc.  There are buckets of pig tails, pig feet, etc.  In the butchers case there is always a nice selection of goat, pig, oxtail, etc.   The produce area changes from time to time depending on whats in season but generally has a good selection of mostly jamaican produce, with a few exceptions from time to time.    There are a few African, Guyanese, & Trini products but the large majority are catered to the Jamaican population.   It's worth checking out from time to time if you need anything."}
{"text":"Produce is fairly good. Most grocery staples available and always a large variety e.g. bread/hard bread, rice, oil (not sure about milk, butter or cereal besides oatmeal). Lots of frozen fish and some frozen veggies available all at competitive prices. If that doesnt interest you well theres two aisles dedicated to west indian spices and hot sauce! Nuff said!! Picked up two Mr. Goudas Yellow Fire 85 ml bottles for $1 total. Very large bags of rice available here. A small aisle for west african foods like fufu and plaintain fufu mix, palm nut oil, natural peanut paste, palm nut for soup and kotoko kebab spice from Ghana. For those who are in need of hair products, you are in luck. They have the most common products, tools, few wigs and extensions too. I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars, Pretty comprehensive selection of West Indies/Caribbean food items, with an extra emphasis on every kind of sauce you can imagine. There is also a decent seafood counter.  The ventilation could definitely be better as there is a not too pleasant fish smell throughout the store!  I'll be back with someone who can provide some guidance with regards to the items."}
