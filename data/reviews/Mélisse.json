{"text":"Melisse is a modern place where you can enjoy a coffee break with a friend. 
The design is really minimalistic with a touch of modernism, the ceiling is high, the place is white, and The terrasse is wide.

The food is not to die for. I went today with my mom for lunch.
We ordered the mezze tapas or they call them \" les a cotes \". Overall the food doesn't meet my expectations as they were high!

The soup du jour was a dried tomato soup with beans and Parmesan. Nothing fancy. 
The grilled salmon with pineapple is fine.
The kafta was bit dry, the bavette with chimichurry was good and tasty (for a $9 plate) and the epautre salad with eggplants was tasteless.


On the coffee side, I tried the  latte and it's fine.

The service was very decent. The waiter and the hostess are very friendly wich gave me a very good impression."}
{"text":"I've been to Melisse a couple of times and I've never been disappointed. Not only is the food great but the place is stylized very nicely. The service is one of the best in Montreal and the coffee is a local Toronto roast that is perfectly handled by the barista."}
{"text":"My husband and I had brunch here recently. The food was good, albiet pricey since the portions were so small. The ambiance is trendy and a bit froufrou. It was full of yuppies and DINKs (just being descriptive and not perjorative because we actually fit into both these categories, lol). 

The menu is only in French, so good thing nous sommes bilingues because otherwise the server would have had to explain the whole menu to us, like he did for the pair sitting at the table next to us. Why not have a bilingual menu and save the staff the hassle?

Anyway, I had the green beans, mushrooms and bacon salad ($8) and my husband had the egg salad on toast with a side salad ($11), he added bacon to this for an additional $2. 

My salad was tasty but really tiny. I should have also asked for the dressing on the side because it was drenched in oil. Also the menu said there were potatoes in my salad but there were no potatoes of any form in my salad. Despite these shortcomings, I enjoyed my salad. The saltiness of the cheese and bacon really complemented the sweetness of the green beans and the different textures in the salad were excellent. 

My husband enjoyed his meal, although I noticed that his toast was burnt. The bacon was thickly sliced and looked delicious. I had a taste of the egg salad and it tasted whipped and fluffy. 

My husband had a coffee ($2) and the sugar they give you are cubes shaped like card suits (although mostly hearts and clubs). I thought this was super cute.

It's really loud in there though, but I'm great at tuning other people out, haha, so we still had a good time.

Service was courteous and efficient. 

I was hungry again shortly after, but it was still an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Went there recently with friends for brunch and thoroughly enjoyed the menu, presentation & service. 

Would definitely go back again."}

{"text":"This quaint little resto located in the old port has a super cute outdoor space too. We opted to stay indoors; the space was modern with touches of vintage chic, comfy chairs and a great laid back vibe. 
We ordered their strawberry mimosas and the casserole Melisse; if it's named after the resto, it must be good, right? Slight mixup with our drink order was readily rectified and although the mimosa lacked in alcohol, it was still light and refreshing, The casserole with potato, ham, mushrooms, cheddar, a fried egg and sourdough bread was perfect! Great flavour thanks to the harissa, nicely perfected and presented. Portion was just right as was the price for this part of town 

I would totally return to this spot for brunch; although a little out of the way from core Old Montréal, I enjoyed the food and feel of this cosy resto. Perfect way to start off a lazy Sunday."}
{"text":"Nice place decor-wise. The place is clearly new and needs a LOT of practice. Friendly service but inefficient and slow. Food is good but the plates are small and heads up, you'll pay $2 for a slice of bread."}
{"text":"My weekends usually consist of trying out new brunch places and on one rainy Saturday I stumbled upon Mélisse with a friend.

Everything about their decor is beautiful, there are cute corners everywhere you look and it's obvious they put a lot of thought into the design. The staff is very friendly and attentive, although a bit slow at times. 

Okay, so let me tell you about the food. I got the pain poêlé. It's similar to French toast, it was served with a lavender crème. It was absolutely delicious and not overly sweet. Some people may think the portions are too small but it's a perfect portion and you won't be left feeling stuffed and uncomfortable. I've been here multiple times and you definitely don't want to miss out on their pastries. Everything from their croissants to their scones are absolute perfection. Add one of their delicious coffees for a full course and you'll be left daydreaming about this meal for weeks to come. I'd definitely recommend and Mélisse is a welcome new favourite to the Montréal brunch scene."}
{"text":"So pretty and peaceful here despite MAJOR construction going on all around them. Some days I actually long for winter. A cabbie once told me there is only two seasons in Montreal...winter and construction.  Very clever, Mr. Cab Driver. 

Wanted to try this place forever and this week I've been twice!  The breakfast tartine with salted salmon was small but amazing!  The chai was on the sweet side. I'm finding that many places use a ready made mix from a carton which is disappointing.  Not sure if that's the case here, but it was sweet.  I prefer a spicy chai. 

Another day, I came in just for coffee while waiting for the rain to lighten up.  The service both times were great!  I can imagine how hectic it could be for brunch as it is a very beautiful space, elegant but not stuffy. I got to enjoy its serenity during their off time.  Great space to do a little work or just daydream."}
{"text":"Tres belle place et agreable ambiance , repas limité mais bien choisi et santé mais étant une gourmande je suis resté sur ma faim avec mon brunch.. ils pourraient se forcer avec les portions ..."}
