{"text":"The food here was top notch - exceeded my expectations - definitely elevated pub grub.  I had the corn chowder, the Black n Blue Burger, and the peach dessert - all three were standouts.  Great place to catch the Jays game too.  I'll be back soon"}
{"text":"Great menu with lots of options. I ordered the burger and it was one of the best I've ever had. Place is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Reviews are legit for this place... 
Nice craft beer selection, including a few taps of Beau's and Halcyon (essentially Beau's side project for barrel aged beers including tasty sours).

On the food front, the burger is legit tasty. Not sure about $5 additional for a side of fries but I'm a fan of their Jalapeno Chips anyways so haven't bothered with the fries. 

This place used to be a sports bar, and they'll still have the tv over the bar showing local sports games, but it was a secondary focus as they still had music playing instead of the tv audio (nice groovey selections for that matter). Thoroughly enjoyed having the music atmosphere but also the ability to check the score."}
{"text":"This place has a amazing food!! 

Had the chowder to start which was off the charts. For my main, I had smoked salmon with capers on brioche which was also amazing. 

A great atmosphere and a good place to catch a jays game. Staff are also super friendly!"}
{"text":"It was a Friday at 10:30pm when my buddies and I decided to go out on Dundas W. Our usual go-tos were rammed with people in their 20s, 905ers and just generally tons of already-too-drunk people. 

We found The Mutt the good old fashioned way: walking by. We went in and had great drinks, really great scratch-made snacks and lovely service. It's dark, candlelit and is probably exactly what you're looking for."}
