{"text":"If you had asked me two weeks ago, I would have easily given this place a 4 star, as I ease more than half my dim sum cravings here with my family.  Most of the waiters even knew us by name.   However, the last two times we went, we were surprised at how badly things can go when they are too busy.  Some dishes were forgotten, some were under cooked.  It was the first weekend with good weather, and some of their staff were missing, that might be what was making things tough for them, but i was taken aback at how disorganized they can become on a busy day and it affected the quality of most of their food.    A few of the dishes like har gow (steamed shrimp dumplings) were still good even at the worst occasion last week.  I hope to correct this review soon if things improve."}
{"text":"great food especially the shark fin soup. They have a great variety of other dishes that we had at dinner.  Overall I would go back if it's expensive Chinese food you want"}
{"text":"This place serves dim sum?  What the Hell...I came here for dinner..  The very uninteresting plaza on 16th Avenue by the neighbourhood with the big houses, this is the only noticeable business.  The fact that it says Regal in the name is enough to catch my interest., the 16 in the name however, ugh..little bit effort please!  I came here with my friend Nicole, and she ended up making fun of me for asking for the English menu.  Look, I've said this before; it's not my Chinese that's bad, it's because I've left China at an early age, and Chinese food on menus are given preposterously fancy names.    Crowd: Seniors DÃ©cor: Not bad Wine: Blue Label Girls: Seniors, although we were sat next to the only other table comprised of youths.   Service: Professional, the head server had the floor locked down.  He also looked like some ex-martial arts teacher, so I made sure to thank him each time he serviced us.  I had the idea of coming here to try out some extravagant dishes, assuming that was the story here being called 'regal' and all, and I thought I brought a cultured friend who knew her delicacies.  They do, and I did.  However, things didn't end up turning out that way. They had the shark-fin soup, but neither of us ordered it.  I HAVE to have rice, so I got the special fried rice or something, with ma por (spicy) tofu.  I started with Shanghai won-ton soup, and Nicole got the egg-drop soup.  This was becoming rather pedestrian, so I told my older & wiser friend Nicole to order anything she liked.  Anything off of the menu, no problems.  I thought I relayed my intentions quite clearly, and I didn't ask her what she ordered in Cantonese.  It turned out, she ordered chicken with almond and green peppers.  We call this in Chinese: Chicken Nails...as in nails to hammer things in, which is perhaps the cheapest thing someone can order at any restaurant.  I was thoroughly disappointed, and even called her out for it.  So here I am, in a high end Chinese restaurant, eating fried rice, tofu and chicken breast.   What is this, my first time in a restaurant?!  I went to the washroom,and noticed that there was Majong (MJ [Chinese gambling thing]) rooms att he front and rear of the restaurant.  WOOT?!  Was this a restaurant, or a retirement home?  That's so gangster!  The bill came out to $80, for $15 worth of food.      Felt like I should have worn my flip flops (I don't have flip flops)."}
{"text":"Regal 16 is literally 5 mins away from me but can someone remind me why I haven't been here for over 5 years for Dim Sum.  Oh yes, I remember now after coming here on snowy afternoon last month.  The Dim sum is as bad as I remember it to be. The service was slow and they keep bringing us the wrong dishes.  The rice-noodle wrap with fried fritter was the worst. The rice wrap just falls off easily and the fried fritter was rock-hard and I can tell it was from yesterday or something.  Disguisting!!    Decor here doesn't stand out and the layout of the place is just weird.  The parkign lot is a mess as well as they never have enough spots during the lunch hours.  I would not come here anytime soon. Maybe another 5 years if they are still here."}
{"text":"Tried their Dim Sum on a recommendation from Chowhound.   Big mistake.   Service was exceptionally bad by any standard.    Food is passable, but not good enough to overlook the service issues...there are so many other places much better.  Located in a downscale strip mall in an upscale neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for dim sum, while I've never actually come on my own and ordered food off the menu myself, everything I've had was delicious!  The calamari was great! It was overly greasy and were in small enough portions that you weren't chomping on a large rubbery squid leg.   A must-try is the rice noodle wrap with fried fritter and meat floss, it's so good and one of their specialties. But honestly everything on the menu is really good and I only had one dish that was subpar and it was the Korean style beef ribs, they were on the salty side when they're supposed to be sweet.  Word of advice, if you are going to order the pot of rice, do it early and make sure you wait for it because they cook it on the spot and it does take time.  The decor of the restaurant is a little weird. There is the main area and then there is one separate room in the front and then in the back there are 3 separated rooms as well. Now other restaurants will break down the walls during dining hours like lunch and dinner but these people keep it up, I think they leave it so that people can play mahjongg in the afternoon but it makes it hard to find people if you're meeting up.   Minus one star for the crappy English translations. Even though I can sort of make out what the translations are, most of them I did not know. For example, do YOU know what a dumpling \"chiu chow\" style is?! And if you're actually Chinese DO NOT answer that!  All in all, a great place for a decent price. It's all the way up in the heart of the 'burbs but for those that are in the neighbourhood, it is well worth the trek."}
