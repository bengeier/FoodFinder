{"text":"Solid Greek restaurant. Best taramasalata ever! Good service. Good house wine and good value. Will go back again."}
{"text":"I want to thank Mythos for taking care of our group. We went for dinner/drinks to celebrate 4 birthdays amongst 15 family members and friends. The food, live music and ambiance was great, we danced the night away.
There was a bit of a situation, which Mythos management took care of and we are very grateful and appreciative of this.

We are long time valued customers and will continue to go back for great food and a great time!!

Thanks you Fanni and Mythos family"}
{"text":"Really good Greek food. Usually you can't find a traditional Greek taverna and i needed to travel all they way in Montreal to find one. Cause here in USA nothing good"}
{"text":"I finally went to Mythos after working in the Mile end for over 6 years.  
The food was excellent the service was prompt and attentive without being pretentious. 

We had feta, lamb and calamari and all of it was great.  
The portions are large and prices are reasonable considering what you get. 

Both my girl friend and I are looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"It is a myth that Mythos is a good restaurant. 

I came here with my three girlfriends hoping to have a nice meal. We had been to Milos before and it was absolutely fantastic, so we had high hopes for this restaurant. Sadly, they were not to be met.

The appetizers, the calamari and the fried zucchini/eggplant, were the best part of the meal. They were light and fresh tasting. However, the lobster pasta was doused heavily in olives and tomato sauce. They charged us 8 dollars to remake solely the pasta to be without olives, which one of us was allergic to. There was no indication on the menu that the pasta would include olives. We were incredibly surprised when we were brought the bill, and our server told us that \"she did us a favour by only charging us an extra 8 dollars\" when in fact the portion of pasta they gave us could have been made at home for around thirty cents. 

The lamb, which we were assured was the specialty of the restaurant, was very dry. It was a struggle to find a piece that was not dry. We were told that it had been cooking for 3 hours over maple charcoals. Perhaps we should have known not to order something that had been cooking for three hours. Perhaps the three hours sucked every bit of moisture out of the meat. 

In the end, the mediocre food (for $$$) was not the only negative of the experience. We had a bizarre server who, quite frankly, would not leave us alone. It wasn't awful, but we did not enjoy the service, especially being unknowingly charged for the pasta replacement. Upon receiving the bill, we discovered that they did not take Debit. For someone whose credit card was just frauded today by some scammer stealing it to make purchases on iTunes, it was an utter inconvenience and embarrassment to have my friend pay for me. 

We will never return to the mythical land of Mythos."}
{"text":"I really love this place! I've been three times in the past few months and I can't wait to go again!

The first time I went was with my parents on a Friday night. We went based on a recommendation from a Greek friend of mine and I am very happy we did. We reserved downstairs where, on Fridays and Saturdays it gets really lively with Greek dancing and live music. The atmosphere was fun and another woman patron even got my mom (a usually very shy woman)  to get up and dance! I honestly cannot really remember what we ordered but I remember it was delicious! My father was impressed by the Greek wine list, but was a little disappointed that the horta (a Greek green) was not what he had eaten in Greece but was actually rapini. Our waiter was very pleasant, gave good recommendations on the wine, and joked a bit with my dad.

The second time I went was for a friend's birthday. That was another amazing dining experience. We were 9 people, sat upstairs, and we ordered one of the preset menus for everyone. We were served a variety of spreads, fried zucchini and eggplant, fried calamari, grilled octopus, salad, sausage, chicken, lamb, and the list goes on. It was absolutely delicious, though it was a slightly ridiculous quantity. 

After the second time, I would dream of that octopus...so, recently I went again to satisfy my craving and sat outside on their cute terrace in the front. I even got a second order to take home and it was just as good the next day cold

All three times the food was amazing. All three times the service and the atmosphere were great!! I can't wait until the next time I go...and for sure the octopus will be the first thing I order"}
{"text":"I went there with my girlfriend for lunch after several of my friends told me I had to try their lunch special. Well, it was indeed very good, but definitely over-rated. The service wasn't too friendly and when we received our main dish -- we both took the fish of the day, I think it was sea bass --, one plate came with lemon and the other didn't, and the waiter was nowhere to be found for the following 5 minutes. So I ate my fish without lemon... Our lunch special, overall, was good and tasty, but I wouldn't say it was a great value.

I wouldn't discourage people who want to try it as the food is very good, but honestly I can't say my experience there was what I expected. It felt a little too pretentious and pricey for what we got."}
{"text":"Came here in June with the family and it was really the first Greek restaurant I had ever been to and the food was amazing. The octopus and the lamb were awesome as well as the loukoumades (honey donuts). The Greek yogurt and coffee are also good for dessert."}
{"text":"I went to Mythos while visiting family, Its a casual place to go to on a  Saturday or Sunday night. I wouldn't consider this fine dinning like Milos but its also not as $$$$. The service is average but the food was really yummy. The calamari and fried zucchini with tzatziki was delicious. I wouldn't order pasta stick to meat or fish dishes"}
{"text":"We went there as a big group and ordered most of their appetizers and mains. The food was bland to average and is in no means good Greek food. I was fortunate to taste great Greek food in Greece several times and there is just no comparison.

I wouldn't even bother with the place even if served the same food at half the price. Outrageous prices given the food.

Service was average and some of the waiters were a bit unfriendly. Possibly because it was busy.

Parking is a pain since it's Parc."}
{"text":"Amazing food with a fantastic chill environment.  Downstairs turns into a night club"}
{"text":"Ambiance and food hit the spot. We went here on a Saturday evening (party of 7) and there was a band, which kept things hoppin'. Food was delicious - greek salad and fried eggplant/zucchini for the table - highly recommend; I ordered a half order of spanakopita and a half order of grape leaves as I wasn't hungry for more (and even took home part of the grape leaves - there were 5 in a half order), and it was as expected. Others ordered chicken breast and potatoes, grilled steak, and I believe octopus & squid (one of these took an extra half hour to come out, as did the steak; they were pretty busy). The chicken and potatoes looked delicious but the portion size was huge (I would have ordered that if I was really hungry or was in a position to store hefty amounts of leftovers). Bread came with oil and vinegar for dipping. We also got a couple of bottles of wine for the table. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of my top 10 restaurants in Montreal.  the atmosphere is great. in the summer the terrace is a ton of fun. downstairs is always a party,  the wait staff is very friendly and accommodating.  love thier kopanisti, greek salad, eggplant /zuccini chips grilled shrimp, chicken, lamb etc ...love that they have valet parking...its a bit pricey at 10$...but well worth it as parc ave is a disaster to park on."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best lamb dishes (prepared \"quebec style\") I've ever tasted. The grilled veal chop is also delicious."}
{"text":"I've been to Mythos several times over the years and it is always delicious. We had reservations at 7pm on on a Saturday night and it was very busy as always!

We usually order the same items and the food is always consistent which is important to me.

We started off with fried mushrooms, fried zucchini and eggplant with tzatziki and a Greek salad,  our appetizers soon arrived and they were devoured quickly.

We ordered a  pretty large red snapper to split between the 4 of us and our waiter assured us it was plenty for us to feel satisfied.

It soon arrived with some fluffy rice and steamed greens. The fish was flaky and flavorful, the rice and veggies were tasty and a nice compliment to the fish.

All in all, a delicious meal in a loud, lively party like setting. Be careful with the wine it will add up to hefty amount in your bill.

The highlight of the evening was the interesting conversation outside:) I was sitting with my mom while she smoked a cigarette and there were a group of men in their 40's talking about a friend of their's that was going off to prison for 20 years for embezzlement and drug trafficking. My chatty mother of course butts in the conservation and our new friends start telling us all about this \"friend\" and his soon to be new life in prison. I dragged my mom away and on our way we went:)

A fun, entertaining evening! Definitely a must!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best Greek restaurant in Montreal. I dream about their food."}
{"text":"We ordered the shrimp plate,roasted lamb and calamari. The food is seriously crazy good. Lamb was so soft and shrimps were huge! Not those tiny ones u vet everywhere else. Calamari portion was small and it's on the pricey side but after u take the first bit u realize it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"3 stars for the live entertainment and the wine list that was a good selection from Greece. 
Found the food way to salty overall. 
It was fresh, I give you that but having been to Greece it does not really compare. 
The ouzeri on St Denis has way better Greek food and less expensive. 
Now if you want to party and have agood time you will probably enjoy this place on a Saturday. Everybody was dancing after the service under Armenian and Greek songs. 
Looks like it was the spot for groups and birthdays. You can even bring in your birthday cake!
Not really my scene.
That's all you need to know!"}
{"text":"how disappointing, for a 4 star and $$$. From the bread that the waitress said cannot be toasted as the kitchen is too busy to the worse saganaki ever which was served cold.We order fried calamari which was chewy, grilled octopus which was ok, greek salad that was fair  I cannot comment on any main dishes as the server never came to ask us if we wanted anything else.For a restaurant with $$$ you would expect better plate presentation.  Personally there is much better restaurants that are close by for so much better food. You wont see us back here again"}
{"text":"I love this place because it has the rustic look with the stone walls just like you would see in Greece, where you would go to have good filling food with good wine and the band singing and people dancing their hearts out. The food is always great from the salmon to the calamari and the lamb chops. It's the real Greek style restaurant where you order multiple plates and you share everything. If you don't want that you can just take your own plate. As for dessert, the loukoumades here are made fresh when they are ordered, but they are made the traditional way with spoons, you can tell from the shape! I love the loukoumades here so much! Great place I would suggest it to anyone :)"}
{"text":"haven't been to other Greek restaurants in the city but this one gets my approval!  I've spent time in Greece since I was a little boy and felt right at home here... food, excellent, atmosphere... authentic, service... the best!  Mythos is the place to be!"}
{"text":"I went there recently with a group of friends for dinner & dancing. We all thoroughly loved it. The service was top notch as was the food and music. Will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on 8/6/2011  a Saturday night. The Greek food was amazing. The staff was courteous and very attentive. As if that were not enough the Greek music was playing and at about midnight the entire restaurant was dancing and singing. My husband and I had a fabulous time surrounded by eight dear friends. Our reservations were for the downstairs which is where the partying goes on. Lots of greek wine and lots and lots of fantastic greek food."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an amazing evening with friends!  The food was delicious, the entertainment amazing!  Had the snapper - it was cooked to perfection! Couldn't ask for anything better!!  A must go to!!"}
{"text":"Came here on sunday for a night out with my bf. Had never been here before, but after seeing all the reviews and recommendations decided it would be a nice spot to try out. On the outside it doesn't look all that nice but once you get in its super cute. I got the shrimp and my bf got the New Zealand lamb chops. All of it was delicious. The waiter was super friendly and really cared about the service he was giving. It was a bit pricey but its definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"My favourite greek restaurant in the city with family style portions,The grilled lamb and veges are heavenly .The grilled octopus is the perfect amount of crispy .They even have performances on some nights"}
{"text":"Wow. This place reminds me of good old days. Greek music, excellent food, amazing ambiance, impeccable service and value for money. I started with the zucchini entree an excellent choice, and my main dish was the lamb côtelette braised and super tender, accompanied with their own was of potatoes. And the dessert was Loukmades with honey. We danced till 2am in the morning and we had a lot of fun."}
{"text":"I've had the chance to come here for the full sit down dinner and simply for drinks. Have yet to be disappointed.

Food : very good greek food. We were a group, so we ordered several items and shared. I'm a pretty big fan of saganaki (some sort of fried cheese), and it was on point here. The loukaniko was amazing and I definitely recommend it. The zucchini platter was also great and so was the octopus. The tzatziki was rich and thick (which is awesome). I don't have anything negative to say about the food at Mythos.

Service : the staff is very friendly and efficient. Our waiter was a little clumsy, but it was all fun and jokes. 

Decor/ambiance : it's in a basement, exposed brick, lots of untouched character- which is great. They have live performers that actually know how to play the instruments and/or sing. Kudos. 

*expect the noise level to be high."}
{"text":"First time here, but the last name should tell you that I eat a lot of Greek food.  The grilled stuffed octopus brought me right back to Greece. Make sure to eat it while it's still hot. Once it cools down the flavour changes. 
Back soon to try other menu options!"}
{"text":"Great food, we ordered meat assortment for four people the plate was huge. Cozy place, great for kids if they used to homemade food. The service was great also."}
{"text":"Love the place.  Authentic Greek food, good service, good value.  I would say their speciality is fish dishes,  There are also a couple of off-menu items sometimes, that my Greek friends know how to ask for.  They have an upstairs and a downstairs. The downstairs is busier and nosier, and possibly more fun if you want that kind of thing.  In the summer you can sit outside.  Surely my favorite Green place in Montreal, but that's an understatement."}
{"text":"Went back to Mythos after I haven't visited for few years. 
The food is still very good. The way the octopus was prepared is amazing, the best I have ever had. I also like the eggplant, zucchini which are deep fried and are like chips. We had grilled meet platter that was very well prepared too. The service is attentive and non pretentious. Strange the restaurant was so empty on Wednesday night, but this actually made the visit more pleasant. 
The restaurant has a nice list of Greek wines to experiment with, but would you go to a greek place without drinking ouzo."}
{"text":"Amazing. A bit on the pricier side but sooo worth it! The entrees are fantastic. From everything from the fried zucchini to the greek salad. The main plates were just as tasty! The pastitsio was TO DIE FOR!!!!! I haven't had a great tasting pastitsio in awhile. It's neck and neck with YaYa's pastitio!! The steak is perfectly cooked. You ask for rare, it comes rare. You want Medium? it's always spot on. Octopus was perfect.. 

See the trend? I would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, live music, courteous service... This is the spot!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out with my gf, we thought it would have more of a romantic feel considering it was Valentine's Day, anyway it had a lot of big groups, man kids also. I took the chicken and had the calamari, both really good. The chicken was moist and came with potatoes and salad, the calamari were okay, a tad oily for my liking. Just nothing to extravagant at this place. I have eaten at better Greek establishments.


The problem here is the service... I find it was a tad to slow but it was fairly packed. I would go back though."}
{"text":"Amazing food! We love Greek food and we love Milos, this restaurant menu is very similar but with even more options, it is less formal so even better for the kids and they have live Greek music (very loud by the way) witch makes it annoying, but fun and different."}
{"text":"We were three girls at dinner and went with what the waiter recommended which was to get a bunch of appetizers and it was delicious!!!

The fried cheese, the zucchini eggplant chips with tzatziki and grilled octopus are a must.

We also got the Greek salad and grilled calamari which were good but I would probably have opted for grilled veggies instead of the salad

And loukoumades are a must"}
{"text":"Pros:

- Service was quick and attentive.

- Quaint painted walls that scream Greek culture to you, with beautiful murals and vases. Atmosphere felt warm and intimate.

- While I didn't dine downstairs (due to the fact we it may be loud and wish to have conversations with fellow diners like we do) it seems to be a lot of fun for those willing to dine in a festive ambiance with a live band, dance floor and bar. We were perfectly fine upstairs.

- The Tzatziki was especially good, as well as the Saganaki. Kopanisti was notably good as well.



Cons:

- We ordered the Mythos meat special platter (requires 4 people minimum) which comes in a beautiful long plate filled with 5 sorts of meats. Sadly, while it looked great, several selections of meats were very average and disappointing. We definitely did not enjoy the taste of the minced meat but I'm sure other people may feel differently. The sausages didn't float my boat neither.

- The greek salad was somewhat uninspired and didn't feel fresh.

- The calamari plate was small and definitely no where close to the best I've eaten.

- The meals in general are quite expensive... especially when compared to other Greek restaurants we gone to and their food being a notch higher in general.



Obviously we didn't try many fish courses, which is supposedly their specialty thus I won't give this restaurant a bad review. However, many plates were hit and miss which isn't acceptable... including the calamari. Overall, it's a nice place, with slightly better than average food but mind your budget as a good meal can cost you well over 50$."}
{"text":"Who goes to Canada and has Greek food? ME! :)
This restaurant was a surprise Valentine's Day choice. We went to Greece last fall and have always enjoyed the cuisine .

We had tasty (fried) eggplant and zucchini slices with tzatziki for a first course wile waiting for the most AMAZING lamb chops I've ever experienced. The lamb was cooked perfectly, a wonderful medium. The lamb was served with Greek style potatoes and broccoli rabe, which was also a pleasant surprise.  My dining companion had Quebec lamb, which was basically as tender as a Grandma's pot roast. This was also super delicious. 
For dessert we had a small order of Loukoumades (Greek doughnuts), because why not, we were walking back to the hotel. I'm glad we did have the dessert, it was also tasty. 

This restaurant has a nice selection of wine and won extra points from me because they seated us in front of a large window, which provided great views of the neighborhood and the snow removal activities happening outside. 

The restrooms are surprisingly nice, well, as nice as the restaurant itself. 

The waitstaff was extra friendly and not too pushy. perfect combo if you ask me. 
If we do go back to Montreal we'll be sure to visit again, so should you!"}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I decided to try out this restaurant and we were very impressed. Mythos is one of my new favourite places to go for authentic Greek food. The restaurant itself is quite big. 

There is a coat check option if needed when you walk in. The dining area on all floors is very nice. There is live Greek music, and the waiter told us that people even dance on the first floor. 

The food was great. Everything we ordered was cooked perfectly. The service was also great. Our water was always filled to the top, and our waiter was very attentive. I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and party on a saturday nite. Esp. if your a guy as it seems there is 3 women for every one guy!! Gotta love it. 
Been here many many time and always great food and service.  
Everything is great on the menu. 
I have brought many people from china here and all loved it."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the fried zucchini and eggplant, followed by rack of lamb, and loukomades for dessert 
Overall nice experience, also enjoyed the outdoor terrace and the outstanding cheerful service of Dimitri .."}
{"text":"I had the Québec lamb plate with Potato and orzo and it was very yummy. Portion wise it was more than enough for one person. Service was great . In fact the chef even came to see if everything was ok. Come with an appetite. If you come on Friday and Saturday nights they have a live band playing downstairs and depending on the mood there could be some dancing. Great place as well for group and birthday celebrations. They also have a terrace outside on parc avenue. Enjoy!!"}
