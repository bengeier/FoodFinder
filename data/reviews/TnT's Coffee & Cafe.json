{"text":"Friendly staff and a LOT of delicious options for both beverages and food. I've tried their Belgian waffles (nothing extraordinary but great for a morning when you want a little extra sweetness for breakfast) and I've also had a couple of their wraps which were delicious.  The place is generally quiet but not so quiet it feels awkward. It's right by the library which is a big plus for me. They serve Alterra coffee and also offer a selection of difference local coffees to choose from. They serve ice cream which I haven't yet indulged in, but I'm sure I will at some point. An all around good place to sit and read, work, grab a nice lunch/coffee with a friend."}
{"text":"I am a regular at TNTs because their food is delicious and their coffee is superb."}
{"text":"Went to TnT for a quiet brunch with a friend. We each picked a waffle and I had a coffee.  You have to order at the counter. This caused some confusion for a customer who say next to us after we had ordered. The man who took our order was not the friendliest, but he wasn't particularly rude. I felt like maybe he just needed to drink some of the delicious Colectivo coffee they serve.  When ordering coffee, he asked if I wanted medium or dark roast, decaf, or flavored. They have labels out for all of the options to help you decide. I went with dark, and it was nice and hot when served to me. I think that Colectio delivers it throughout the day, because while we were there, a woman walked in with two containers full of hot coffee.  My friend had an Oreo waffle which was crammed with chocolate. The Oreo cookie bits added a nice crunch. I went with the Elvis, which was topped with creamy peanut butter, bananas, and chocolate sauce. It was sooooo delicious.   The eating area is cozy an during our meal, sstaff came out and chatted with some regular customers.   I will definitely be going back to check out all the other waffle options and maybe even the savory options too."}
{"text":"We found this nice little cafe on Yelp while visiting Madison and had a great brunch. The place is in a little shopping center and was near our hotel. The Belgian waffles are highly recommended and they had a limited but attractive menu for lunch and dinner. Everything we ate tasted good and was homemade."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I have been going there for blended iced coffee and they are great. I also really like the soups they have. There are always a few choices and I have never been disappointed. They are the only place I can find that sells chocolate covered coffee beans which are delicious. The only other food item I've tried there is a breakfast burrito. The burrito was very good, but they take a little while to make so if you are planning on ordering a sandwich or something like that make sure you have time because everything is handmade to order."}
{"text":"worst food, worst experience i have ever had in my life.  ordered a chicken bacon club sandwich - and the chicken was not fully cooked.  I politely brought it up to the counter to inquire and was immediately met with hostility.  the meth-head cook (at the counter) proclaimed \"i personally cooked that sandwich and it was 150 degrees\".  she refused to look at the cold, pink center of the chicken when prodded and insisted it was a fully cooked bird.  so i left, and she probably ate my sandwich. safe to say i won't be going back"}
{"text":"I always enjoy the friendly staff and the food is always good. I love the treats too!"}
{"text":"excellent chocolate chip waffles, a rare indulgence. excellent coffee.  very prickly person taking the order.  she probably would fit better in a position without interaction with customers."}
{"text":"Tnt cafe is probably my new fav coffee store. I am surprised I did not discover it earlier. Its family owned and the atmosphere is always warm and inviting. The food is delicious. Try the chipotle grilled cheese sandwitch and they have drink specials everyday. Its right next to the library and very convenient for a quick snack for the kids. They also do special order cakes and cupcakes. Thanks Katie for the delicious 'bucky' cupcakes you did for my son's bday! They were a hit with both the grown ups and kids.  Great location. Definitely worth a try. You will surely find something you love."}
{"text":"Good prices, delicious collectivo coffee, and convenient location. Definitely try out some of their speciality drinks because they are all as delicious as they sound. On par/better than Starbucks with a much better bang for your buck, including some local pastries and snacks. I haven't tried their more formal meals but they look and sound pretty good.   The shop is right next to a public library, so I like to pick up a drink on my way to study sessions."}
{"text":"I am always leary of coffee houses that serve food because typically the food is overpriced and pre-packaged.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the food at TNT- it is all made fresh and tastes delicious.  I highly recommend the waffles!  The coffee is also excellent.  My one wish is more seating, but since that isn't possible I just try to get there early or during off hours."}
{"text":"Good stuff. I would like more juice (non-coffee) options, but their coffee and chai are really good, as are their waffles and egg sandwiches.  If only they were open on Sundays! ='("}
{"text":"Just found this place.  It's not fancy but it's great to have so close to home. The coffee and food are really solid.  I had a breakfast burrito that was grilled panini style - it was really good. They've also got like a dozen different types of waffles. The service makes it feel more like a restaurant than a coffee joint.  I'm adding it to the rotation."}
{"text":"Stopped here to kill some time with my baby while my husband was having a cavity drilled.  Barista - not so friendly.  Latte and donut holes - meh.  Very small interior but does have a bunch of seating.  Will not come back unless desperate for caffeine."}
{"text":"Waffles are baked fresh and served all day. Everyone is super nice and the Chai latte has magic in it. Seriously. Try it."}
{"text":"Tired for first time, ice cream was great, malt was AMAZING!! Lots of things going on, framed art and greeting cards for sale, long list of food options so kinda hard to focus but enjoyed it and will go back."}
{"text":"When I was a kid, we used to head to a local shop for \"Alaskan waffles\" which were waffles covered in ice cream. I've been craving this for so many years so when I saw the waffle a la mode here, I leapt at it. The waffle was perfectly cooked and the flavor was excellent. The ice cream serving was perfect sized and I made the decision to complete the childhood menu by using the \"superman\" ice cream which is a rainbow vanilla ice cream that's super creamy and perfect.   What a perfect way to start my day!"}
{"text":"Good chorizo breakfast burritos and great waffles.  Solid coffee selection.  Quiet, relaxed atmosphere, probably not ideal for squirmy kids..."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting our daughter and staying at a nearby hotel.  We went here for a delicious lunch - I had the steak and white bean soup with the salad bar. The soup was excellent and the salad bar had lots of fresh choices - unlimited.  We took my daughter and her husband and three children for breakfast the next day.  The owners and staff are very helpful and accomodating.  They made it such a fun and homey experience.  The place has nice things for sale - coffees and candy, dessert items and ice cream.  The children loved it. The waffles and egg sandwiches were great."}
{"text":"Great service and really delicious food. Highly recommend for breakfast! They use the freshest ingredients in everything."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, and had both breakfast and lunch menu items, and been very satisfied both times! Service is quick and friendly and prices are fair. I always appreciate a resturant that uses local ingredients as well."}
{"text":"The coffee drinks are superb & they offer delicious gluten free waffles (also bread & rolls ). The owner is friendly,  and although the woman who also works there takes a bit of warming up to, she's also very sweet. Would definitely recommend TNT to any of you reading this ."}
{"text":"Stop here every chance i have. Small locaton, great food, fresh and creative recipies. Never dissapointed."}
{"text":"Food was so yummy! Friendly customers too.  Its nice when you can sit in a quiet coffee shop that is clearly popular to its local regulars and be able to strike up a conversation - regardless of the age gap! I sat down when the cafe was filled with a few elderly couples and was able to, at age 22, strike up an hour long conversation with them about traveling to world. Mike and AnnMarie made my afternoon. If you go and have the pleasure of eating delicious Belgium waffles while chit chatting that lovely couple then you're in for a treat!"}
{"text":"A quieter, gentler coffee shop. So comfortable and warm, not so loud like other coffee shops. Love the black & tan Collective coffee served in a mug!   Also had the roasted red pepper,  tomato egg & provolone ciabatta b-fast sandwich-- tasty , hot & served to me st the table in a matter of minutes."}
{"text":"Coffee was nothing out of the ordinary. I had an ice coffee with a cupcake. Cupcake was nice and moist. It's a quiet place to spend some time with a book or your laptop. They have a nice variety of books and magazine if u didn't bring one yourself."}
{"text":"I came in before 7am, and the place we empty (always a bad sign). Only one person there and he was busy working in the back. He was nice and I ordered the Thai bagel. He brought it out and it looked pretty enough. Then I bit into it. The Thai bagel was tomato, cucumber and sprouts on an egg and cheese bagel. The cucumbers were soggy and the sprouts were destroyed by the microwave. Not to mention the bagel was ruined. The sauce on the sandwich was spice-less and tasted only of peanut butter.   Honestly when will shop owners get it? This is why Starbucks is on every corner. You can make a store look nice but if you cut ever corner the product will suck, and people won't come to you business anymore.  Throw your microwave away!!!! If we the public wanted microwave food we would all buy Jimmy Dean!"}
{"text":"The Belgian waffles are really good here at TnT's Coffee & Cafe. Light and fluffy, they won't stuff you, but, especially if you go with some of their crazier toppings, you'll definitely know you just ate something good."}
{"text":"This place has it all. Nice location located off high point rd. In a nice little nook around other shops and restaurants.   I came here for breakfast (they also serve lunch). They have a grand selection of waffles as well as egg sandwiches, burritos and classic breakfast items.   Coffee selection is like your neighborhood Starbucks (only better). Lots of options from straight up espresso to drinks with some flava!   Prices are just right too! Order food and drinks at the counter, find a table and get served.   Last I heard they had a cookie dough bar-couldn't find any info on their website but might be worth asking about. No it IS worth asking about!!!   I'll definitely come back for more at TnT Cafe."}
{"text":"they have an unusually  good small breakfast menu . Nice small intimate place to have a meal solo or with a friend ."}
{"text":"Coffee was excellent- got the medium roast- and I typically go for light/medium roasts.  Ordered a Belgian waffle with strawberries.  Waffle was good- strawberries could have been juicier.  Menu when you walk in is only the coffee drinks, they should also have a food menu displayed- I only knew to ask about the waffles because of past reviews on Yelp- if I hadn't I would have only thought they had coffee.  Staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Well, I've been here twice.. And each time I've been snubbed by staff, owner included. Having worked in a coffee shop for years I know what a customer expects and I know how staff should present themselves; friendly and hospitable. Coffee shops are neighborhood hang outs.. It should be inviting and welcoming. This place is not. Which is why Ill be choosing another neighborhood coffee shop to spend my time and money. Foods good here, and I'm not denying that, but you can get good food in a lot of places."}
{"text":"My husband and I had errands to run on a Saturday, and one of them was picking up something from our vet's office, which is right next door to TNT. I went into the vet, he went into TNT, and we met back at the car.  He ordered a coffee and a big chocolate muffin to go. Nothing about this chocolate muffin was scrumptious. It was not fresh, tasted stale, and was very dry and crumbly. We continued our errands and attempted to eat the muffin in the car as we drove. We gave up after a few bites because it was too crumbly.   The coffee did not have a strong, bold flavor and seemed watered down.   My husband said the girl at the register seemed nice."}
{"text":"I got the Thai Chicken Pita, and while the sandwich was warm and the pita was heavenly soft, the chicken had absolutely no flavor. It was cooked just fine, but super bland. It's an easy fix though, if they read these reviews. Just toss the cooked chicken in the peanut sauce, and then it might be my new favorite lunch.  Went on a sunny Saturday at noon and sat by the front window, so I can't speak about lighting. Atmosphere was quiet, which is how I prefer to dine. Ladies room...ok, can we talk? First of all, put up some hooks for coats, purses, etc while we do our business in there. I had to hang my purse on the hydraulic door mechanism two feet over my head. Here's another idea. The ladies room doesn't need to be that big. It's ridiculously huge. And your seating area is pretty small, so do you actually need both a men's room and a women's room? Why not get rid of the ladies room, knock down the outer wall, and make the dining area bigger? Then make the men's room a non-gender specific restroom with hooks for coats & purses, and maybe a baby changing station for your customers with small children. Just some ideas. And those tall chairs in the dining area...those need to be repaired. Badly. Maybe the screws are loose or you got them really used, but every chair I sat in was wobbly and it was a little concerning.  Pumpkin spice bread/cake was to-die for: not too sweet, but sweet enough it didn't need frosting. I asked if they made their pastries there, and learned the gentleman taking my order baked this spice bread himself. Nice job!  All in all, I would go again."}
{"text":"Good donuts! Place is a bit small, however it's cozy."}
{"text":"Nice waffle. Hard to digest food in this atmosphere however. The lighting is 6 stark curly compact flourscent bright bulbs augmented by the stark cold lights of a refrigerated case. Too bad it could be cute intimate and inviting. I felt like I was in a Greyhound bus station in the 60s."}
{"text":"OMG where do I begin?? The second I got in there this blonde woman zipped her purse and looked scared. I am an African American woman. I was wearing a north face fleece and uggs. In no way shape or form  did I look like I was about to rob the place or anyone. The vibe was VERY uninviting and the guy I'm guessing who is the owner took my order than gave it to a barista. Both had attitude and were not polite AT all. Not even fake smiles just plain faces that looked mad. I still acted polite and still smiled. After I paid and got my drink but it tasted watered  down and you could barely taste the chocolate and peanut butter in my frape  so I asked her to add more. She said she would have to remake the whole thing giving me a bitchy look daring for me to ask her to do her job. So of course i did. And I thought WOW. Anywhere else they would remake it NO PROBLEM so I didn't know why it was one with them...pinching penny's I see?? Bad customer service driving you out of business?? I will NEVER come back here again. If you want a great local neighborhood coffee shop without a side of racism try willy street or Atwood"}
{"text":"Came here originally for the Belly Bites free waffle offer and the library book sale next door. Not super impressed. The service was mediocre from start to finish. The tables were not exactly dirty but also not exactly clean. The chocolate waffle was actually bitter tasting. The mocha was alright but a little too frothy and not particularly hot.   I like the location of the place and it has a lot of potential, but it fell short of every expectation. Not going back."}
{"text":"I work near TNT, and occasionally I will stop in and grab a coffee before work. Let me start off by saying this isn't the first time I have felt like I am an annoyance to the employees, and my co-workers have told me they have felt the same way.  Often times when I go in to order I don't get a hello, and I feel like I am a bother to them.  A couple of times there was a regular customer right behind me, and the tone changes immediately!  The food is good, and the coffee is too, but the staff, owner included is very rude and unfriendly.  The  ONLY reason I go, is because it is so close to where I work."}
{"text":"Yay, TNT!  High marks for: THE ELVIS BELGIAN WAFFLE! OMG, seriously. Peanut butter, whipped cream, chocolate chips, bananas.... YES!!! Also for having \"pumpkin spice\" as one of your \"regular\" coffee options. Friendly staff (although they spend a lot of time in the back, which means you often walk in to a seemingly empty shop). Also, being an independently owned west-side coffee shop with food AND ice-cream waffles!  Could use: better seating (there are a few \"4-person\" tables near the front at which four people could NEVER sit because there is no space), longer & Sunday hours--seriously. I always want to come on Sunday, and no dice.  Overall, very solid. Yay."}
{"text":"Small but comfy cafe! The Belgian waffles are their specialty and seriously delicious. Stopped in today for breakfast with my other half for breakfast. About a dozen different waffle flavor combos. We tried the chunky monkey (chocolate and walnut waffle topped with more walnuts, bananas, chocolate syrup, and whipped cream) and the fat elvis (chocolate chip waffle topped with peanut butter, bananas, chocolate syrup, and whipped cream) both of which were tasty and generously sized. Big thumbs up for having both Colectivo coffee and Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream. Not going to lie, I've stopped in on hot summer days after work just for a dish of ice cream. Also, the Milky Way Latte is perfection! This could become a Saturday morning favorite."}
{"text":"Grab a latte every once in a while here. Girl working register is always nice not sure why the bad reviews. Fast in comparison to Starbucks and better price.  They have there own taste so if your looking for something differnt. Also sell banana bread and other breakfast snack food."}
{"text":"We had a business meeting here and LOVED it.  Great food and amazing coffee.  We wished the layout could be a little cozier but what they lacked in atmosphere - they made up for in quality food/coffee."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to give TnT's another try - my first experience with them was split down the middle with ups and downs. The cafe has been open for a couple of years now, but despite living up the street from them I'd never been until last week.   + bright and cozy dining area + fast and friendly service once I got to the front of the line + the waffle I received to go was perfectly cooked and didn't get soggy sitting in a hot and steamy to-go box  - the waffle I received was not the waffle I ordered; I asked for a chocolate waffle and instead was given (and, I later realized, charged for) a chocolate chip waffle -- I am sure I could have complained and gotten the right thing, but I like chocolate chips and dislike wasting food, so I just went with it - my cook/waiter was literally dripping sweat from the combination of a warm day and a tiny kitchen space, and it was hard not to imagine that some of that sweat made it into my waffle as he leaned over the iron to pour the batter - their hours are pretty limited - the reason it's taken me so long to check it out is that they close not too long after I get out of work and aren't open on Sundays (aka prime brunch time)  The most important part of a restaurant is their food, and the waffle I had was probably the best I've had in Madison. I'll definitely have to give them another try, just maybe on a cooler day."}
{"text":"Really good food and coffee. Always creative lunches like chicken and waffle sliders on the specials. Been very happy all 4-5 I've been friendly staff as well"}
{"text":"TnT cafe, I wanted to like you. Really, I did. Seeing as you live in my neighborhood and I have clients in the area, you make for an ideal location for me to stop in and get work done on my laptop. However. I shall be coming to you no more.  I have been in three times this week. Your coffee is good. I had the Alterrra Love Supreme as well as the Door county Red Velvet Mocha.  What I did not have was a good experience. The first two visits of this week were fine. I was greeted, I bought my coffee, and I went about my business. Solid.  Let me say this; I had no idea there was a $3 minimum to use plastic. During my first 2 visits this week, there was never an issue with using a debit card. No one ever mentioned it (I don't carry cash. I know, I know, save the lecture).  Today I went to buy my 2.22 cup of coffee the cashier rudely told me there was a $3 min. I told her I had been in 2 other times this week and no one had told me that. She then moved a plastic display to show me a small sign taped to the cash register. Swell, I thought. Welp. I have no cash and I am not buying a donut. I explained I was in 2 other times this week (afternoon visits, not AM visits) to which she said, \"I don't think so, I have been here all week\".   Rude. Rude. Rude. Rude.  Rude.  Not going back. Sorry, TnT. This is why I refer to this part of Madison as suburbia hell."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a breakfast place. Gf likes real maple syrup, which they don't have here, but the food here is pretty well done. Got a chicken caesar wrap and quesadilla."}
{"text":"Lured by the Belly Bites offer of a free waffle, I finally ventured over to Sauk Point Shopping Center to check out TnT's Coffee & Café.  Since TnT offers over twenty different Belgian waffle options (http://www.tntscafe.com/#!belgian-waffles/c1d1u), I soon realized this was not a solo mission, and enlisted the services of my daughter, who serves as the waffle connoisseur for our household.    With its harsh lighting and its limited comfortable seating options, the interior seems a bit sterile for a coffee shop.  The unenthusiastic person taking my order seemed to take her cue from the barren surroundings, not offering much advice when I asked her what she would recommend and later robotically dropping our plates on our table with nary a word.    My daughter ultimately settled on the Chocolate Overload, described by TnT's as their Taste of Madison award-winning waffle (a chocolate chip waffle topped with Chocolate Shoppe's Zanzibar ice cream, chocolate drizzle, & whipped cream.)  On paper, it sounds like a fantastic combination, but in reality, it more like sucrose overdose.  It is waaaay too rich and the rapidly melting ice cream turned the middle of the waffle into a soggy mess.  While my daughter adores waffles and especially loves Zanzibar chocolate ice cream, she will be eating them separately from here on out.  I selected the chocolate chip waffle.  While the waffle was well prepared (subtly sweet, crisp on the edges and slightly soft in the middle), all I could taste were the fist full of mediocre chocolate chips.  More is not always better when preparing food and that important lesson went unheeded by the kitchen for both of our dishes.  While I generally enjoy Colectivo coffee, my dark roast was especially bitter and tasted slightly burnt.  Maybe it was just a bad day for the folks in the kitchen, but the uninspired offerings served up that day do not have me motivated for a return visit."}
{"text":"Damn this place for being so convenient and having pretty good food because the coffee, service, and prices leave so much to be desired. The staff seem completely bewildered by their register system. It's expensive to start with and then they nickel and dime you for every last raisin. Their coffee is a lot like hot brown water. I've had some weird egg dishes, but the bakery and oatmeal are solid. I'm always mad at myself when I get in a bind and only have this place as an option."}
{"text":"I've been to TnT for breakfast and lunch, and have always been pleased.  Their coffee is top notch and the breakfast croissant with egg, sausage, and cheese keeps me coming back.  Oh, and lets not forget the fresh donuts in the morning.  Those are about as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Really cozy cafe, right near the library. I enjoy their chai latte. They also have a nice selection of waffles with all different types of toppings and lunch items. Their baked goods are pretty standard but yummy. You can also get day old treats for cheap and they still taste fine. They also serve Chocolate Shoppe ice cream. Service is pretty good and fast. If your in the area its a nice local place to grab an inventive waffle, coffee, or lunch."}
{"text":"The guy and I went here for the first time today, and were really pleased. We split a pumpkin waffle and a bacon breakfast burrito. The waffle was tasty, although a little on the crisper side. The breakfast burrito was the best we've had in Madison. The coffee was Alterra and thus excellent.  As for service, it was friendly and prompt. The cashier was pleasant and helpful, and came by once we got our food to check on us. The owner/cook brought our food, then checked on us later and thanked us for coming. We saw nothing like what a couple of reviewers complained about. We will absolutely be going back - and bringing family and friends!"}
{"text":"I've visited this cute shop probably 10 times in the last year, as it's just down the street from my house.  What lured me in is I learned they serve Alterra coffee...which I love!  The café is quaint...nothing too special, but their drinks are always superb (their honey latte is fantastic!).  The last three times I've been they have used \"Crest Whitening + Scope\" insulator wraps on their cups...which is ridiculous to me!  If I'm going to pay $5 for a latte, I don't want a cheesy ad to come with it...after all part of a coffee shop is the experience (you can call me shallow but you know it's true).  My last visit this morning also included an un-friendly barista (I'd never seen her before) that made my drink wrong which I didn't realize until I was already on the road...and decided to turn around since I didn't get the hazelnut I paid for in my drink.  At this point, I'm going to go two more blocks and visit Barriques...or if I have time drive to the new Alterra café on the square.  I'm bummed since I love Alterra coffee."}
{"text":"Poor service and the owner is rude. She didn't like the fact my elderly mother and I entered the cafe 10 minutes before closing. She seemed annoyed and made sure to let us know if was closing soon (in a very rude tone). She was more concerned about closing out the cash register. From my understanding this is the typical attitude from her. I would avoid this place if possible."}
