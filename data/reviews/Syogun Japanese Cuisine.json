{"text":"Probably one of the best AYCE sushi restaurants that I've been to. As mentioned, on the weekends, you can order sweet shrimp sashimi. At first, I was apprehensive about ordering it because I've had bad sweet shrimp at non-AYCE places, however, it was very fresh and good size (sometimes, sushi places have tiny, tiny \"sweet shrimps\"). 

Everything else on the menu was enjoyable, with very good portion sizes - small enough that you have the opportunity to try multiple items. For example, the rolls come in 4's, so you can try more than one roll. Another plus was the dessert. They have black sesame ice cream, which I've never seen at AYCE sushi before, along with other jellos (black current and litchi), mango pudding and a chef's special. 

While pricey, $24.99 on the weekends, I would say that its worth it."}
{"text":"amazing service. food was good and no msg. price increased a little but still very reasonable. mango rolls were really good but Maki rolls were ok not too good."}
{"text":"Take out was bad. 
- Didn't get our soup. 
- sushi was really sloppy, rolls were still stuck together because they didn't cut all the way through
- salmon roe was replaced with flying fish roe on the salmon roe sushi. 

Definitely not reordering."}
{"text":"Ordering off the ipad is fun but it stops there.
Many items even though different taste the same - maybe they just douse everything in the same sauce. They don't tell you whats what, just drop it off at your table and leave. 
Customer Service is not in their vocabulary. 
Food isn't bad though - its just ok.
You get charged a \"surcharge\" 5% if you use debit or credit card. When you tell them they have to inform you in advance they just say \"well you agree you have to pay the bill\". What a con.
There are, without a doubt, many other better options in the same area and I shall happily take my business elsewhere"}
{"text":"If I could give Syogun less than one star, I would!  This place's food was okay at best, but their services were horrible.  From the moment we stepped into this place, we were given attitude by the host for not having reservation... did I mention the place was pretty empty?  After we were seated, our server came to take our order without explaining to us how the menu and ordering works.  Five minutes later, our food came, but he forgot my drink order, a coke.  So I reordered it along with a water for my wife.  He came back, and dropped the water a glass with what looks like to be tea on the table and left!?  Are you kidding me??  Is it that hard to get a drink order right?  OK, fine, I reorder my drink, and finally got my Coke.  After the first round of sushi was gone, I ordered some more sushi, and I guess I shouldn't have been surprised when the wrong order came out.  So when my horrible dinner was finally over, it took me three times to ask two different servers to get my check.  When I finally handed my check by the server, did I mention that was the ONLY time it was not slammed on my table?!  I could not wait to get the Hell out of there, and I would not recommend anyone to go to this hell hole."}
{"text":"Weeknight AYCE dinner was really $32/pp ($23.99 + 12% service fee + 13% tax + 5% for paying anything other than cash).  Food was decent & fresh but waiters' service wasn't worthy of the automatic 12% service for table of 5.  

Also, $15.99 for kids 4-9! My little one barely eats 1/2 a bowl of food. Ordered from the ala-carte menu for $6.50 chicken teriyaki noodle soup. 

Not sure if it's worth a revisit at this price and quality of food and service as there are a ton of other options for $75 for 2 adults + 1 kid. 

PS. There's no red tuna here if you're a fan of it like me"}
{"text":"Average food.  Slow, forgetful and inefficient wait staff.  Please hand out order forms instead of recording orders on small notepads from 1985.   Lost orders, inattentive staff and lack of service.  For an auto 12% service charge, please try harder."}
{"text":"I come here quite frequently with my family for some good quality sashimi. It's fresh and comes in decent-sized pieces (compared to the itty bitty pieces that some other restaurants serve). I think the most popular item on their menu is the sweet shrimp sashimi. I have yet to find another restaurant that serves them! So sweet and so smooth. They also have a good selection of sushi, maki rolls, and cooked dishes.

I have to say that their service is not as impressive when it gets busy. It becomes a mission to even flag someone down. I do understand that it can get crazy dealing with so many people for a long period of time. However, for the price that a customer pays here, I think it's fair to say that a certain standard of service is expected of them in return. I also feel a little iffy about the automatic 12% tip added on top of the bill.

But other than that, their food is great, and it's what keeps my family and me coming back for more."}
{"text":"It was thursday 1130am 16 April 2015.  We 3 person go to synogun on woodbine at hwy 7 next to Costco.  It was a horrible experience.  I mark down the number and quantity from the menu.  The order taker said I cannot do that it is a punishment for him.  Weird!
then in the middle of my first order he said we for sure cannot finish it as there are more than 60 sushi and have lots of rice.  Our group have 3 person and my friend confirmed that I do can handle all the food.
In 5 to 10 mins lots of food came and we finish them all.  We started to make second order for ayce but the formed orderer neglect us with poor attitude HE MIGHT BE ONE OF THE OWNER WITH NO UNIFORM!
My friend at least 4 times when he pass by us and he negelect us.  Also he whisper to the other staff a girl and other guy with uniform not to take our order, when they pass by the table, they just ask is to wait.
I also check our order.  I feel like some sushi is not coming over an hour.  I make order and they said wait we still have something not coming yet.  I beg your pardon.  You hold my order , can I hold the bill payment by instalment paid your store.  I can create an reason you don't need money. Right
I was not busy at lunch time and they have lots manpower.  I suggest them to increase the price instead to give hard time and provide poor customer service
We are at one time walk out and go for such an unacceptable service. Servers keep saying bad word on us and the sushi maker
In the end as we final the order they said loudly \"Is that's is!\" I was so frustrated to this company and I write this brief review.  I wonder how they got 3 stars
NO MORE!"}
{"text":"Shogun is a great AYCE restaurant in the Markham area to satisfy your sushi cravings! 

We came here for a Sunday night dinner and we were very happy we did so. Service was great and the overall decor + atmosphere was very casual and relaxed. 

Food was of better quality compared to most AYCE sushi restaurants that we've been to and delicious! The sushi wasn't packed with too much rice to fill you up (like many AYCE sushi places tend to do) though the slice fish on top could have been a bit thicker. Sashimi tasted fresh and was perfectly sized as most other restaurants are. There was a large variety of fish and other foods that you can order from their iPad menu! We especially enjoyed the addition of torched sushi which was glazed with a slightly sweet sauce that we loved! Most importantly, we felt like the sushi rice was sticky and had the perfect amount of vinegary taste to it in order to compliment the fish (or as perfect as an AYCE place will be :P)

Aside from the actual sushi dishes (including rolls and such), the rest of the food was also very tasty. We enjoyed the spicy pork ramen and all the tempura we ordered, including the mushroom tempura which not every AYCE sushi restaurant offers. 

However, we did not like that there was an extra 5% service charge for paying with Credit Cards. We also didn't like that the tip was already added to the bill as that can easily be overlooked and customers may accidentally tip twice (or more than they intended).

Overall Syogun delivers delicious AYCE sushi and a wide range of other tasty dishes, while maintaining friendly and fast service. We'll definitely be coming back in the future and would recommend this place to all of our friends!"}
{"text":"They always mess up your order by not bringing it or bringing less. I don't know if they 're betting that you'll forget and not want to order anymore by the time you remember or that they really missed your order, but either way I find it irresponsible! They even mess up the ice cream order...

The food is less than mediocre! The wasabi mussels had wayyy too much mayo in that mixture. Grilled beef was too salty. Katsu chicken was thinner than paper. 

Also watch out for your bill, they place a service charge BEFORE the tax, which is ridiculous!!! Make sure you make a fuss about it and they will lower the final amount for you."}
{"text":"This time I hv both positive and negative review for this  Auce Sushi , I was left alone my friend dont show .  All I can do is to ask them to take back one dish that I never eat.  I feel guilty too.  The waitress bring the dish to eveyone of the coworker then go to the kitchen.  I was so surprise that she tellinh me.  Either finish it or $5.  I sincerely thanks to the cashier supervisor tov waive the fee and I certainly will come again. With all my friends."}
{"text":"Used to be our choice of get together with friends. Liked the long booths and coupons we got from Chinese publications. Food was decent, sashimi was fresh the soup noodles were well made and service was speedy. However it has gone downhill since they switched to IPAD ordering. Visited today (labour day) for lunch $17.99 + 12% service charge. First round of food we ordered did not come in completion. When we asked the waitress if we should order again of the missed items she kindly checked to see if the order was pending and got back to us (hence the one star, otherwise zero). We waited another 15-20 minutes before some of the missed items showed up however only in half the quantity we had ordered. This was over an hour after the order was put in. Perhaps the use of iPad ordering gave an expectation of immediacy. But an hour wait.... any subsequent orders we placed took another 30 minutes (except for pop and soup which takes about 15 mins). Although it gave us time to catch up with friends but our lunch ended up taking 3+ hours and we ate only half the amount of food we would have normally eaten. The table turnover was non existent since we were all waiting for food to arrive. Some tables gave up and ordered ice cream and left. Most likely will not visit again very disappointing especially when we have been loyal customers for at least 6, 7 years."}
{"text":"I went for lunch today and either they have changed owners or chefs because the food was not up to the usual quality.  Rolls were small and not fresh. The sushi feel apart and the tempura shrimp in the rolls were not good.  Price went up, I am not sure if it is to do with the addition of the Ipad ordering system but today's experience left something to be desired."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Saturday around noon.  Food was ok.  Prices are typical for lunch.  Offerings are nothing out of the ordinary; you have your typical maki rolls, hand rolls, some hot foods (eg udon, teriyaki,etc).  

Service was pretty slow; we were waiting a lot, trying to catch the attention of one of the three wait staff working that day for each thing we needed service for.  We waited to be seated even though there were empty tables all around.  We waited to get our first round of orders in (it's an AYCE place).  We waited again to get our second round of orders in.  We waited for the bill. Probably would've been easier for the customers if there was a check sheet where you can mark down what you want.  Instead, you have to wait for the staff to come around to take orders for the whole table (and most things are ordered by piece), which slows things down considerably.

In short, it's an ok place, but nothing special.  I probably wouldn't go there again, given the variety of other restaurants in the area serving food of the same quality at the same price, with much better service."}
{"text":"Went here with my family of 6. Sat us down at a table made for 4. It's cramped, I didn't mind. It's an AYCE so service is mediocre. Which is also fine. Sushi was delicious until we got home and was all sick. Major food poisoning. My wife called them back to tell them politely but they swore at her instead. Don't come here unless you enjoy liquid butt."}
{"text":"The good food was ruined by the TERRIBLE service. They were slow, scattered, and inefficient. It took forever to locate a waiter to order and by the time the food arrived we already forgot we ordered it.

However, I recommend the garlic beef, short ribs, and ox tongue. They were so tender and juicy. However, I will not be returning here because of drag down of the wait staff."}
{"text":"Sushi is fresh, but the service is poor. They charge 5% for using debit card! What's that all about? And an additional service charges. Beware!!! not sure if this restaurant is worth all the fuzz. There are better sushi places out there."}
{"text":"This place is a big time rip off.
A 12% service charge is forced on your bill and if u don't have cash, u have to pay 5% additional charge on your credit card and DEBIT CARD! I have never been to a all you can eat sushi place that charges 5% on debit card, that is RIDICULOUS! 

Why do I have to pay 12% tip, there is virtually no service, everything is ordered on a iPad and they just deliver for you.
What if the food is bad and I don't have to pay tip at all. 
We end up paying $70 for a Wednesday AYCE DINNER! Damn I regret it so much, I could have gone to a much nicer place with better food quality.

Avoid this place at all cost people!!!!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 star. Here for lunch. Quality good. Service good. No extra for using credit. 12% added but this was less than I would have normally tipped. Will be back."}
{"text":"Fish is always fresh, food comes fast.
They have shrimp sashimi on weekends too

I grab takeout here at least twice a month
I always get t14, its 60 pieces for only 30 bucks i think. Very good quality for an ayce place and really cheap. Very good for parties. Everytime i order, its ready within 20 minutes"}
{"text":"Four stars because this is my go-to. 
They recently moved their menus onto ipads.

I really feel like I've loved it since the beginning and now I'm only just rather fond of this place. The food is still yummy and good, but it just doesn't get me as excited as it did before. Still good though that even though there are two AYCE Japanese restaurants not even 5 minutes from where I live, I will drive the 20-25 minutes just to go to Syogun."}
{"text":"The food I would say is pretty good. The sashimi salmon is has a nice sweet taste to it and all the beef dishes were very tender. I would say it has pretty decent food for a AYCE place. 

It would have received 4 or even 5 stars if it wasn't for the horrible service. In general it was all alright until you try to put in several orders. Well we get charged extra for not finishing food so yes we would be ordering in smaller quantities. A waiter was constantly on the phone and it takes a while to get their attention. They even took our tea kettle away and never came back with it.

*********What i found ridiculous is that they charge an extra 5% on the bill if you try and use your credit card to pay. Canada has a \"No Surcharge Rule\"!!!!!!!!!!!!! On top of that, if they were allowed to put a surcharge which they are not, it needs to be specified before a purchase was made (ie they need to tell you at the door before you start ordering or food or even seated)********

To sum up, good food, bad service, and bad options for payment"}
{"text":"Had a rather large family gathering of 10 for the sushi buffet, minor gripe was the room we were in was a tad on the small side.  I didn't get to take in the decor of the restaurant, but on the other hand I was too busy stuffing my face with sushi to take in the surroundings.  I enjoyed almost all of the sushi we ordered except the red snapper seems like it was it frozen and the white tuna was not as good as ones I had in other sushi establishment.  Overall service was fast and friendly and the sushi was great."}
{"text":"Lunch is ok...eat and leave, but dinner price is a bit expensive for a place like this. Service not very good, food is average....but the setting of the place is not very decent and enjoyable. Will not come back again...(half and hour after I ate this this place, I went to the washroom 3 times already! Feel very sick now! )"}
{"text":"Good sushi, fair price, decent service
I like their fake sitting on the floor tables.
Looks like you're sitting on the floor cross legged like in a traditional Japanese restaurant but they just have holes under the table to put your legs in so you dont actually have to sit cross legged - just makes it look that way."}
{"text":"3.5 stars from me
Went for a midweek lunch, they have all you can eat for about $14. 
I found the ayce selection to be vast in comparison to other ayce sushi joints I've been to in the past. Seaweed salad(4*), sushi pizza (2*), maybe 6-7 rolls, single sushi/maki, soup + plenty more. 

I found the sushi pieces to be quite good, better than I have generally found with ayce. The rolls leave room for improvement. 

Service when you arrive is very prompt but  sort of tapers off once you've sat and ordered from my experiences. 

I would return"}
{"text":"Terrible service and quality of food .... 

Our horrible experience started with us locating our own seats after the waiter rudely and randomly pointed at an empty booth. We then had to ask for the menu and tea - which is suppose to come automatically upon seating but never did.... Waited over 20 minutes for our orders, not to mention some didn't even come..... Worst thing is 12% tip is included, felt like I was being punished for receiving bad service.  

As for the food itself, it was mediocre. My sushi fell apart a few times and the taste with their teppanyaki items was nothing special. 

Overall, I do not recommend coming here because I cannot justify spending 25.99 + forced upon 12% tip for sushi that falls apart and incompetent service.

Would honestly give zero stars if I could ...."}
{"text":"This was my worst experience with AYCE. The quality of the fish was pretty fresh but the service was awful. My daughter and I were seated promptly and our order was taken immediately.  After some of our order was delivered to our table I asked for ginger, wasabi and more serviettes. These were not delivered. We kept asking several times. Eventually the ginger and wasabi was dropped off but no serviettes. We called another waitress who brought us two serviettes. By this time we had finished eating. 

We placed a second order after many attempts to get a waitress. We order six different things. We waited for a long time to get one order of teriyaki salmon which was very tasty. A couple minutes later we got two very bad tasting teriyaki shrimp. We order eight. Thank God we didn't get eight because they were the worst tasting shrimp we have ever had. 

We never got the rest of our order. After asking why we didn't get the rest of our order the waitress dropped off the dessert. Dinner at Syogun was not worth $55. I will never eat at the restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"The salmon, tuna, fish roe, etc were not fresh. They had a very fishy almost spoiled taste. It's mediocre Chinese owned Japanese restaurant. Sorry but it has to be said. The food standards depleted completely. What happened Syogun?"}
{"text":"Worst place ever. We were put in a little room (basically a closet) where the AC was blasting. Luckily I brought my jacket but who wants to eat wearing a jacket? The sushi was very disappointing- mushy rice and falling apart. We didn't get a few items that we ordered. It took 3 order attempts for us to actually get a miso soup. To top it all of, you have to pay 5% more if you use any other method of payment other than cash. Shady!! This place looks run down. I don't understand how it has gotten any good reviews. Must have had different owners. I will never go back here ever again."}
{"text":"S/O and I arrived at this place around 6:30pm on Valentine's Day. The seating and ordering parts went pretty well at first. Drinks and soup/salads came soon after. Then the kitchen foods arrived before the sushi, which was a bit different from other ayce places I have been to. Sashimi and sushi came around 15min after we put the order through, which was not quick but still reasonable. 

Then here comes the first delay - two hands rolls arrived 30min after we ordered and the two sets of rolls (4pc each) came 35 min after! We ordered a 2nd round and guess what - 3 pcs of eel sushi took 35min to arrive on our table. Not to mention that our 3rd round including miso soup (easiest to make) and beef short ribs never arrived. 

We were quite impatient at this moment and we just decided to leave. Our dinner lasted around 1.5 hr and we never actually got full. I was aware of the 12% service charge and went up to complain to the employee. He apologized and took out the service charge for us. He said that the slow service is because it was a holiday. However the restaurant was only half-full when we ordered our first round but everything was still slow. I have worked in the industry and your restaurant should be fully staffed on those days because you know it's going to be busy! Quit already if you can't provide good service when it's not even fully seated!"}
{"text":"Pretty good AYCE Sushi.
I've tried a few AYCE sushi places while on Vacation in Markham.  The selection of sushi and other Japanese food was good, and the service was excellent.
 The chawan-mushi (steamed egg) was really good, tempura was fresh, and salmon sashimi both large and fresh.
My only disappointment was lack of Tuna, which is a staple of sushi in the USA.  Otherwise a good experience"}
{"text":"The bill came to 136$ for 4 ppl (27.99$ a person). When we asked to see the menu for the pricing one of the waiters said the prices on the menu are wrong. They tried to scam us because we might have ordered a bit more than usual ?????? But this was and won't be my last AYCE sushi. Save your money and go somewhere else. This place is a scam. We came here on a monday night"}
{"text":"It's been about a year since I've been back, and this time overall meal was a bit of a letdown (went on a wednesday night).  Only sashimi we had was the salmon, which was pretty good for AYCE (i'm spoiled from the quality stuff from Taro's in North York).   The rolls with the soft shell crab was good as well, while the rest of the rolls were just ok.  Chicken teriyaki, pork cutlet were a bit dry, and udon was bland.  The grilled scallops had way too much overly sweet mayo on it.  The worse was the tempura shrimp, while the batter was fine, the shrimps themselves were soft and mushy and didn't taste fresh.  At least my parents seemed happy with the place, although we'd probably stick to the ala carte higher quality sushi places next time we crave Japanese."}
{"text":"I agree with most of the people on this who say the food is pretty good. Only thing that irritated me was the bitchy girl waitress that kept giving me dirty looks when I reminded her that she forgot my order like 2 times. Got pretty annoying when I would remind her and instead of putting in my order she would go & take someone else's order... Also really sketchy how they charge you 13% tip before tax. Although this place was better than a couple other sushi restaurants, I rather pay more at a different restaurant then have to remind a server multiple times about my order."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've come to Syogun and I must say that I was fairly disappointed with my most recent visit. 

The restaurant has shifted to the system of ordering from a tablet. For starters, the kitchen doesn't seem to be able to keep track of the orders as we experienced several items that took an extremely long time to come as well as some that just didn't show up. We had to follow up with the servers many times for those items only to be told that they would be working on it. This wasn't happening at just our table as our neighbouring tables were experiencing the same issue with their food items too. It is recommended that you order everything in your first order as the subsequent orders would have less items show up. 

The food also came in one at a time and was not consistent leaving us extremely hungry to start only for alot of food to come near the end when we were near full. The selection of the sushi has gone down too with the number of food items available decreasing from the last time we came here. However that is not to take away from the quality of the food as the food was still tasty. As others have mentioned they do include a 12% service charge automatically on your bill so remember not to tip twice.

All in all the latest experience was sub par."}
{"text":"At around 6:00, the restaurant isn't very crowded and we got a table fairly quickly. When you are seated, you are given an iPad in which you can order your food. We didn't realize it at first, but you can scroll through each category to see more options. 

Food arrives fairly quickly. We all enjoyed the sushi and the salmon was very fresh. We all agreed that the dessert was very good(especially the green tea ice cream, black sesame ice cream and the lychee jelly). Service was also very good. Waiters were very helpful and came to take away our finished plates very often.

Great food for the price."}
{"text":"beef 
Spicy scallop hand roll
Squid sushi 
Tamago sushi
Chicken teriyaki"}
{"text":"Service are complete shit! No one ask us if we want any drink! Narrow space between tables. Food bring to wrong table all the time. The food I ordered didn't come at all.
They charged 5% extra on credit cards. Service are horrible. I have to go to the counter to pay bills because no one is serving us. 
2 people Friday dinner $75. WTF?! Worst place I've ever been to. Will never come back or recommend for anyone."}
{"text":"The Good: 
- Steamed egg and sesame ice cream are really good. Must try
- You also get 1 set of sweet shrimp and octopus sashimi for free (NOT ayce though). However the portion is small as each person only gets 2 sweet shrimp and 2 slices of octopus... hmm..
- Fast service

The Bad: 
- Pretty sure they reuse the scallop shells for the grilled scallop
- They didn't give us the sweet shrimp / octopus sashimi, not until we asked them to
- salmon sashimi NOT fresh

The Ugly: 
- 12% mandatory tips
- 5% credit card additional charge (they didn't warn you about this)
- You have to use the tablet to order food which is totally fine, however if you look at the main screen there are only 40-50 items to order, it's because THE REST OF THE ITEMS ARE WELL HIDDEN. You have to click on \"ayce\" on the upper left hand corner to see the drop down, then click on the category to see all the items!!! The good stuff like grilled scallop, steamed egg are well hidden!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is OK. It is a bit pricy for AYCE and they tack a mandatory 12% service charge. 

Had a bad experience - half the food didn't come and we were left sitting for an hour or more. Had to flag down servers who were annoyed. Seems like they stop acknowledging orders before the 1.5 hours was through."}
{"text":"Arrived here for the first time here for dinner on a Saturday night.  Not busy at all around 5:45 pm, but there was a wait when we left around 730.  For an AYCE sushi place, the quality of food and presentation is excellent.  It's even better than half of the non AYCE places out there.  Very good variety of menu items, although some of the sashimi portions were on the small side.  However, you can just easily order more pieces.  The best AYCE place I've had in a long long time."}
{"text":"Craved some AYCE sushi after workout and decided to come try Syogun after reading the reviews.

First of all, if you love sweet shrimp then you are going to love their weekend dinner since they have all you can eat sweet shrimp! Also the quality of the sashimi was good with the usual selection you would expect from an AYCE menu.

The kitchen food was also very good, we had the garlic beef and it was tender and tasty. I also liked the miso grilled fish.

The one thing that I didn't like that much were the rolls. I thought that their rolls had a bit too much rice in it and there wasn't much variety in their specialty rolls.

The desert selection wasn't that big, like 5 or 6 items I think,  but I saw some tables got black sesame ice cream, they ran out though when I was ordering :(  Also have to mention that they served actual cans of pop instead of fountain drinks!

Service was ok, food came very quickly but often times had trouble getting the waiters attention.

I will most definitely return to Syogun again in the future."}
{"text":"The variety of rolls were better than a lot of sushi buffets. They served small portions so you could try a bunch of things instead of places that serve you a giant 8 piece roll to get you full. Overall, good variety and quality of food."}
{"text":"Not a bad place but there are many better alternatives in the area. The good is: grilled skewer shrimp, salmon torched, tuna torched, pop, sesame and green tea ice cream. The bad is service and each dish was pretty mediocre overall. I read one earlier post on the service charge. While I don't care it's added to the bill, it should be disclosed before and that amount should not be taxed. Kinda weird that a restaurant charges HST on the tip when it should be after. But I think I'll end up going to other places that are within a 10 min drive away."}
{"text":"Syogun is probably one of the few AYCE sushi joints that actually offer greater quality sashimi. (Though once in a while, I find some varieties are still served frozen.) They also have unlimited sweet shrimp sashimi! Coming from an avid AYCE sushi eater, finding sweet shrimp sashimi is pretty special.

I'd have to say that their rolls and other menu items aren't very significant, but their sashimi keeps me coming back. To be honest, I find myself coming here only to have multiple rounds of sashimi and not much of anything else.

The service is decent, though servers could definitely be a little more attentive. I'll also note that they usually don't serve you the same amount that you actually ordered, for sashimi at least. Fine with me though, I can stay there all night until I'm satisfied... :)

Syogun is worth a try if the thought of unlimited sweet shrimp sashimi excites you!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I last visited Syogun and I'm not sure why! They use the iPad ordering system now and the food came out super quick - no missed orders. The selection was really good and they even offer torched sushi. The beef tatami sashimi, white fish carpaccio and salmon tatami were excellent, as was the grilled scallops. On top of all the standard rolls, they have a ton of specialty ones also. There wasn't anything we didn't like and soft drinks are included in the price ($26.99 weeknight). If I had to complain about something, the only thing I could really pick is it would've been nice to have a bigger dessert menu."}
{"text":"Came here with family friends to catch up. We were extremely satisfied by how the food came out. The thing that got us was how slow and terrible the service was. I've asked for tea twice and didn't get it till the third time. Everytime we ask them for something, they seemed very upset and looked like they didn't enjoy their job. 

Their sashimi was mediocre- not as fresh as I usually eat it but still pretty fresh. I would definitely recommend the beef short ribs! Those were delicious. Other than that, everything else was mediocre but not terrible! 

We expected a gratuity charge to be added because we were a party of 7, but because the service was so slow and terrible, I really didn't want to tip them 15%. Overall, I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Food is okay but arrive super slow, just like some other all u can eat they don't give enough food as we ordered. AND SERVANTS TRIED TO PRETEND NOT SEEING US WHILE REQUIRING SERVICES. Tips already included in the bill total, if u not careful u will be paying extra 10% tips. Very tricky, and if you pay debit of credit u need pay 5% more. That totally none sense."}
{"text":"I wonder if they changed management in the past year.  I noticed the quailty of the food has lowered so much.  It used to be quite good, now it is not good anymore, too much rice on the sushi and too little fish.  =("}
{"text":"Super awful service. This place needs to hire at least three more waiters because we waited 30 minutes for an empty seat that literally just needed to be cleaned. The waiter kept telling us five minutes even though it has already been 30. we were finally seated at a different table but after trying to get the waiters attention for 15 minutes, we decided to leave. We we're in quite a hurry to just eat and leave but this place just wasted our time and we are quite upset about that.

Why on earth would you run a business on a busy Saturday evening with only ONE freaken waiter. The poor guy was trying to take the orders of at least 7 tables at once while serving AND cleaning tables. Someone give this man a raise because he is the real mvp of that restaurant. I blame the owner of that restaurant for not having enough staff and losing future business from us."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner today. Wasn't too full or too empty.

They have free unlimited canned pop,which was a bonus over fountain drinks. 
Salmon sashimi a bit thin, however the shrimp sashimi was great. However,they kept reducing our orders. We ordered 30 pieces shrimp, they gave us 10. We then ordered the remaining 20, they gave 5. We ordered the remaining 15, they gave 6. 

Scallop sushi- rice was warm??

Overall, their rolls are good for AYCE.

Washroom floor sticky. Maybe not a good sign.

If you're in the area (costco nearby), have a try."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad, but it was meh in comparison to some of the other local establishments.

GOOD: The sashimi was fresh and they didn't seem to skimp out on the thickness of the cuts when you place larger orders, and the sweet ebi shrimp (only available on weekends) was a new texture and it looked pretty cool with the head. 

The rolls were not bad they were a bit on the small side but not too small, so your stomach and diet can afford to get a few more rolls.

The service was also not bad, quick to notice when your water needs refilling and food came at decent intervals.

BAD: The music was overwhelmingly loud. I love music but not when it blasts so loud that it's hard to hear my friend talking. The sushi's fish to rice proportions could be better."}
{"text":"Not coming back. NO STARS DESERVED!!!!Very poor service, very slow and our orders got mixed up big time!!! One server kept delivering our orders to the tables next to us, HOW FUCKED UP IS THAT???"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night around 8pm. Restaurant was about half full with a friendly atmosphere. Modern decor, although if you're not sitting on a bench seat, the chairs are a little too low. Menu and ordering is done by yourself on an Ipad which most people like.

Food - 3.5/5
The food was good, nothing amazing, but solid all around. I feel like what usually happens at a lot of AYCE japanese restaurants is that the first order of food tastes pretty good. However, the quality and taste decline slightly with the next orders. For example, the beef tataki was very good the first time we ordered. Sliced thinly, fresh and very flavourful. Second time was noticeably thicker and a bit more chewy. I feel like they do this on purpose so you stop ordering it. 

Service - 3.5/5
We were seated quickly, food came out quickly and the staff collected empty plates promptly as well. However, I took off a point because when I sat down, I noticed my cup was dirty. It was a rather large food particle on the cup, so it kinda boggles my mind how the person setting up the table didn't notice it. But fine. I asked for another cup, and the waiter brought me another cup that had a food stain on it.... You would think he would double check to see if the cup he was bringing me was clean. Obviously not the case....

Value - 3.75/5
Good bang for your buck. Most AYCE jap places are $25+ nowadays and Syogun was $27/person (weekday) if you pay by cash. The cashier said it is 5% more if paying by credit. I felt that the selection was slightly lacking, but overall a decent AYCE japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI BUFFET RESTAURANT IN THE GTA! PERIOD. 

If you read my review history, you'll see that I've tried tons of AYCE sushi places. I'm proud to declare that Syogun is the best in GTA, relatively speaking. 

I arrived on a Saturday just a little bit before 7pm. It looks like we arrived at the right time because we were 1 customer group away from having to wait. 

The most important thing in a AYCE sushi restaurant to me is their selection. Syogun has hands down the best selection. It's not the largest selection but it's the best. To start, they have many things that typical AYCE places lack. 1) Sweet Shrimp 2) Grilled Miso Fish 3) Ramen that actually resembles Japanese style 4) Scallop Sushi 5) Taro and Pumpkin Tempura 6) Black Sesame ice cream and other deserts 7) free pop 8) beef sashimi. It's not an exhaustive list but it goes to show that this place knows how to break away from the standard. 

The food quality is definitely above average. It's \"almost\" like going to Japan. By far the most amazing items were the sweet shrimp. To my knowledge, this is the only AYCE restaurant with sweet shrimp. Scallop sushi was amazing too. It wasn't a scrawny piece of scallop. It had enough scallop to cover the rice. The sushi rice has the right texture so it's significantly better than most places in GTA. The ramen's portion was just the right size for a buffet. They add pork slices, corn, and naruto so it feels like real ramen. The soup base needs more work but it's already better than every AYCE place I've tried. Most importantly, this is the freshest sashimi I've ever had in the GTA. 

I normally don't comment on service but the staff work amazingly fast. They clearly have the most well organized system I've ever seen in AYCE place and they seem to handle a full restaurant just fine. I saw at the bar which oversees the sushi chef counter and see that they handled full capacity while also doing take out. I've seen places that can't even handle 60% capacity with the same number of staff. Kudos! 

Price wise it's just a little more expensive than most AYCE places but this is acceptable to me since their food is so good. They add 12% service charge to the bill automatically and I can overlook this. Final bill comes out to be around $30 per head after tax and service charge. 

This is as good as it gets in the GTA but it's not perfect. What would make it perfect is if they have squid sashimi and octopus sushi. I'd also like grilled mackerel. But maybe I'm asking too much...I'm already very impressed with this place."}
{"text":"I really liked how efficient and fast the service was.  The servers were all very courteous, respectful, and professional.  All of the food that we ordered arrived to our table (no order was missed) in a reasonable amount of time.  I took a quick look at online reviews after my visit and noticed that some people complained about the service.  I actually really thought their service was more than decent and appreciated how the male server was so courteous and respectful to all the customers.  It was a good experience and meal at Syogun Sushi Bar!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to be HUGE fans of this place. We loved the food,service and atmosphere. Very disappointed the day they decided to ignore or lose our order 4 times in a row. Unfortunately, we havent been back since then. This was last year. 

Just an overall horrible experience"}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place for AYCE sushi. You order via tablet. Foodwise its your average AYCE sushi restaurant. Good selection of tofu / cucumber / avocado options which I appreciate. Decor is spacey, modern, and overall amazing. Friendly service. Tips are included in the menu but feel free to tip more.

Overall it was a nice place. Not sure why the low rating on Yelp."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what 3 stars represents. A-Ok.

The food there is pretty good, all tasty and not stale. The grilled and cooked stuff actually taste fresh. The best thing to get is the cheese mussels. Those are delicious and my friend and I always get like 10 each. Another great thing to get is the deep fried milk custard they are small in size but sooooo good. Sweet but not overly sweet. They have a ton of stuff to order and it's on an ipad so you can see pictures. 

The parking situation is a hit or miss. It is located in the plaza connected to the costco parking lot. Which can be crazy on a saturday but I managed to find parking with ease. There is also another Chinese dim sum in this plaza. You would think the parking situation is stupid but it's really ok. 

The service is probably what dropped the rating to a 3. Lunch is only till 3 and after that, they are closed until dinner (5pm). They will mutter in Chinese rushing you to get out and hurry up. Give you the bill a little bit before 3 whether you ask for it not. They do a last call and make it known that they are closing at 3. I get it you close at 3 and you want a break, but can you realize and treat your customers with a little bit of patience. Also they have this tendency to just slap things on the table. They also will roll the dirty dishes cart around and knock the back of your chair without a sorry. (Sighhh)

The decor is nice though, modern but nothing fancy. The seats are oddly low compared to the table. Maybe i'm just short. I will continue to come here because it is one of the nicer ayce sushi in markham for the price and slightly cheaper. 16.99 for lunch on weekends."}
{"text":"Poor customer service, food is okay not amazing. But my biggest complaint is having the tip bundled into the bill. I should be able to determine how much I want to tip especially if the service is terrible. In addition there is a 5% surcharge for paying anything other than cash, that is ridiculous. I have never been to a restaurant which has done this. 

Also sashimi / food quality goes down hill after the first round of orders and continues to diminish in quality the longer you stay as if they are rushing you out."}
{"text":"Shrimp sashimi is available for dinner Friday to Sunday.  Very fresh."}
{"text":"It's been a while for me in the AYCE sushi game. This is also a revisit after an almost 2 year hiatus here. First step into Syogun, I noticed they have newly renovated decor and they got rid of the 2 large private seating areas on the left-side, a little sad, but it does open up a LOT more seating area for more potential business. 

They changed their ordering system via tablets, and it's a different system compared to all previous tablet ayce places I've been to yet. I went for a Thursday dinner with a party of 3, and we had absolutely NO problem with our waits. In fact, we sat right next to the cash counter, and I overheard a waitress's concern on our first orders, making sure we had \"something\" on our table other than tea and chopsticks.

Highlights of my night were the sashimi, grilled miso fish, grilled scallops, short ribs. They actually gave us the amount that we ordered! I have no complaints over the food and delivery, it is very fair. Pop drinks are still offered by can and included in the price! My only complaint would be the lack of desserts - only 3 kinds of ice cream, and 3 kinds of pudding - perhaps those are only weekday choices.

Payment:
- No more 10% off for cash payment, total shown on receipt is cash price.
- 5% charge if you pay by credit card
- Tips is already included in the receipt, beware!
They also upped their prices to $26.99/adult for a WEEKDAY dinner, something I was not prepared for because during my research in returning to Syogun. I was under the impression of the old prices.. $23.99.. but that's my problem, and that's the cost of renovations and upgrades -.- I'm just stuck living in the good old days! 

All in all, Syogun is decent but a tad expensive now, not worth the quality of what I can get there. Would rather pay $30+ ayce elsewhere :( But service is good! Good place for large groups."}
{"text":"I think lunch is a very good deal at Syogun.  With only $14 (+tax+tips) you can get anything you like (except they don't offer sashimi for lunch), for example, 

sushi (nigiri sushi, various special rolls, hand rolls, maki rolls)
appetizers
teppanyaki dishes
tempura
soups
ramen/udon
rices
dessert/ice-cream
tea/pop

I really enjoyed their sushi dishes.  Definitely not comparable with high end sushi places, but Syogun does serve very fresh food.  Salmon and shrimp rolls were great!  Sushi rice was a bit warm on the touch, so that's something they should improve on.  For cooked dishes, I especially liked the grilled salmon head and neck with salt.  Also loved grilled beef with garlic flicks.  Initially I wanted to order red bean ice-cream, but they ran out of that and instead they gave us black sesame ice-cream, which was even better. :)

Each order is generally listed per piece, so you won't over-order your food.

Service is generally prompt.  Decor is getting outdated and I found music a bit too loud.

Do bring cash or else you will need to pay service charge if you pay with card.  Tips is automatically added to the total so you don't need to pay more."}
{"text":"Frozen food, horrible service, mandatory tip and the machine asks you to put more tip. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Decent sushi. Maki were not great, the nigiri and apicy salmon sushi were okay. Service is neither quite slow or fast. Nice and quiet, not too busy at lunch."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch all you can eat. The food is great. If it makes it to your table. We usually have to wait a very long time to get our food. The restaurant is understaffed. Food is great."}
{"text":"This place has had a long history, its been around for over a decade and has changed owners and renovated itself at least 4-5 times. throughout it all it has kept the same name. 

I went here with my family on Chinese new year eve dinner. We were in a party of 7. This review of course reflects the dinner AYCE not the lunch, i've been here for lunch and its purely not good. for some reason dinner is where they step up their game. This place is definetely a great quality for the price. it is not as pricey as all the other AYCE sushi places that have started labelling themselves as premium but hasn't offered premium food. This place does things consistent and well. 

The sashimi is fresh and sliced pretty evenly. the cooked food is great, the short ribs and the grilled scallops are definitely a must try. The wasabi mussels are pretty good too. Overall what stands out to me are the cooked items. They are consistently some of the best, and the Sashimi has always stood up in terms of the quality. I think the food may not be creative but what they do , they do well. and thats important. you won't find the largest menu available, but they do a good job with most things on that menu. 

The restaurant also has changed most recently to an interior design that looks like a izakiya.

i would recommend people to try it out for dinner, and it is a nice food,a with a nice atmosphere for both family and friends."}
{"text":"(Food:)
Typical AYCE food.  Lots of quantity, but lacking in quality.  They do have the torched salmon sushi, which I like.

(Price:) 
$28.99 per person on a weekend dinner.  I think a lot of AYCE prices have gone up recently.

(Service:)
I like not talking to servers haha.  So they have IPAD ordering service, which is great!

(Overall:)  
Typical AYCE, and be prepared to spend over $30 per person!"}
{"text":"Came here on New Year at around 6PM and didn't have to wait. The place started to get busy around 6:30PM. 

Pro: They have black sesame ice cream! Nice variety of food, fresh sashimi and sushi, and the udon was surprsingly good!

Con: Many missed orders, orders were slow, ice cream came half melted, some skewers and grilled food were cold. Heard many other tables complained about missed orders. We asked for tea refill once and the waitress came back but gave it to the table next to us. They were confused af. We lol'd. 

On top of all the above, they automatically charge 12% service fee on your bill. Not worth tipping this much for thid kind of service. Also charge 5% if you use debit or credit card so do bring your cash!!"}
{"text":"Syogun is a convenient spot for the Markham/Richmond Hill crowd for AYCE Japanese food.  It's nearby Hwy 407 and it's on a Woodbine ave. stretch coming off of Hwy 404.  

There is a Karaoke Lounge on top so there's always entertainment after dinner.  Plenty of parking so you can park SIDE-WAYS if you wanted to.

Like Restie c. said, this is one of the FEW AYCE places where they have the Group Rooms separate from the general dining area but I was told to book in advance and make sure you tell them you want the ones that are in Japanese-Style or else they have a room in the Generic-Style.

It has a good selection of both cold and hot items.  Sashimi is acceptable and that's why I eat lots here although I remember they had Uni AYCE for an additional charge but I had ONE and stopped.  There is a good variety of HOT items here that I really enjoy.

The atmosphere here is Mood-light and a bit CHRISTMASY almost.  At times with the CROWD, it can definitely be loud.  The wait staff do a good job and you can see the Sushi Counter from most of the dining area.

At the waiting area they have a DISPLAY of miniature plastic food for your waiting pleasure but usually at most I've waited behind only 2 groups."}
{"text":"It was nice to come back to the restaurant since the last time I was there was 2010. The place looks slightly renovated and better than I remember it looking with the dark lighting years. 

I was having dinner there last weekend in a booth with 5 other people and it was slightly crowded but we managed to fit and put all the dishes on the table. It was the booth near the front and middle booth between others in the section. The problem I found with our group is the constant bumping in the seats from each side that was coming from the kids behind both sides. We had been disturbed by the kids who were jumping in the seats and not to mention oily fingers coming up behind on the dividing booth section. Other than that it was okay. 

The food quality was average. Nothing really stood out that I thought tasted better. In my opinion we did not order enough food since we are not big eaters. I didnt take as many photos since the others were too hungry to wait. The food presentation was simple.

I was surprised that the \"ice tea\" that I was served was tasting so watered down from the powder with added sugar. It was not tasty and I got fooled by the menu. 

Anyways this place is not so bad but I will go as alternative choice. We originally planned to go to another place but it was fully booked that night."}
{"text":"I wish i could give 0. 
Food was not too bad but service was the worst. I go to so many different restaurant and I can assure you that this was the worst of all. Never come to take your order and they make it seem like they want you to leave. We were a group of 5 spent $140 on dinner and left feeling shi*"}
{"text":"This place used to be our go to sushi spot. However going there recently made us decide not to come back.  Advertised on the window was \"under new management\" we thought ehhh can be a hit or a miss. We enjoyed our previous visits so we decided to try. The service is really poor... I had to work so hard to get staff attention. They seemed to avoid eye contact. Their sushi seemed to be the same, however their dessert menu can really use a little improving. Later my boyfriend told me they charged an extra $2 dollars ONTOP of the regular $2 fee (that's added onto your bill) they charge for paying with card. That's just gauging. So now we won't be returning. We're going to go somewhere else definitely."}
{"text":"Came for a friend's farewell party. Weekday dinner price I was told was $26.99 + tax and tip. With a large party, mandatory tipping is no fun. My cash payment ended up being $36 and a bit. Having done the math, it seems like they charged a mandatory 20% tip after tax. This is a tad ridiculous, especially as there were a number of missed orders, and we got most of our tissue and spoons ourselves from the serving station behind our table. The credit card price was $38 something. Um...how did that happen?

Pop is included. Canned pop, save for the iced tea. iPad ordering. While it's fun, if it doesn't increase the accuracy of the orders, it isn't that helpful.

While they do have some more unique things on their menu (beef tongue, grilled scallops, torched and pressed sushi), most of the food was average. Highlights included the beef tongue, the miso fish, and the black sesame ice cream). The torched and pressed sushi would have been up there as well, except that our first round of torched sushi, the sushi was the narrowest nigiri I've ever seen in my life. There was torched flavor to the fish, so I'll give them that. However, every round of the torched and pressed sushi, the sushi was blanketed in mayo-based sauce. I like my mayo, but this was excessive. IT did not help that the grilled scallops, the wasabi mussels, and the other grilled mussel dish were also drenched in mayo. The scallops were not full scallops. They were half scallops which looked like full ones because of mayo content. 

I wouldn't voluntarily come again, but I didn't voluntarily come this time either. It wasn't for the food. It was for the friends."}
{"text":"The food are good But the service was terrible. No service was provided. The server and the food runner would just throw food on the table. When you need some thing and ask for a server they would pretend not to see you. The server was rushing to get you out. While you were eating your dessert they would start clearing your table and even took away our water. 10% service charge was automatically added to your bill."}
{"text":"I was not pleased with my second visit here. I remember from my first visit that the food came in very early with a small waiting time after ordering and that the food was of very good quality with a huge selection but during my second visit, I found out that the ordering system changed from pencil and paper to the tablet, and because of this, some of the food we ordered actually didn't make it to the table and that the waiting time was too long to the point that our party was all starving by the time it got to us. As for the variety and the taste of the dishes, it did not reach the quality it once was. The price was too expensive for my liking, considering the experience, the time and the food. I would not come back again-once was enough."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful and the prices are great.  Good news is they are VERY busy - bad news, the service is sparse.  Also, they are not licensed so you cannot even get a Saki which was disappointing.  However, we will go back..."}
{"text":"My go to ayce sushi place, unbeatable price tag and taste. Favorites are their syogun roll, and steak teriyaki. Everything is super fresh and the service is fast paced."}
{"text":"Certainly \"A OK\".  As an AYCE restaurant, my first decision was to go with the regular menu, since the tuna was the dreaded mystery fish \"white tuna\".  Instead, I opted for the sashimi lunch special for a surprisingly low $7. 

I liked the different presentation. The slices of fish were arranged on a bowl of rice. The cuts were all fresh, but thin-3 slices of salmon were equivalent to a single piece at other places. There was also a scoop of caviar arranged on top of the rice, which was a bit difficult to eat when it is not firmly attached to a piece of sushi or inside a maki roll. 

I did need to order more to satiate my hunger, so I added a Rainbow Roll. Really I should have had the AYCE, but it looked like thin slices on a disproportional large amount of rice. 

I left with a $15 cheque, which is about the same as I would have paid for a regular sashimi lunch at my fave spots."}
{"text":"It's a decent AYCE Japanese restaurant. Everything here, such as their food/service/ambiance, is \"good enough\" for the price. I'd only go to such places if I'm in the area. They offer all the standard raw fish and cooked food items you'd expect from such an establishment. They also have bottomless pop and iced tea, something I wish all AYCE would offer.
Their lunch price comes out to about $17.XX after tax every day of the week (meaning there is no fri/sat/sun price premium for lunch, while most AYCE Japanese places would.)
There is plenty of free parking in the plaza, which is connected to a Costco.

If you drop by, try their Sunomono salad, a vinegar based salad which goes well with your feast. I usually order 2 or 3 of these for myself."}
{"text":"Worst CS ever. Don't even have the time to sit us while half of restaurant were empty. No greeting at all. At the end, just yell at us saying we are doing our best when we asked. Avoid the trouble guys."}
{"text":"We were looking for all you can eat sushi and we end up stopping at this place. We did not think it's gonna be all you can eat but it is. So the place is nice which I like. The food was great too we ordered tofu sushi and I loved it. Salmon sushi tested great too. The two main things I did not like about the place is the plates seems bit old maybe they need to renew it. Our server was bad but the other servers seems ok. The server mess up the tablet that all the ordered food was canceled and I had to re order. The place finish lunch at 3 which is earlier than I expected I wish they lasted longer and they kept warning for last call. I will come here and check it out hope we get better server."}
{"text":"honestly so disappointed 
i've been here before and it was awesome 
but their quality just keeps getting worse and worse 
and the service... don't even get me started 
they cut down all of our orders by half or more 
and after bringing out the sushi half an hour after our order was put through, they made us wait over an hour to bring out the rest of the food 
even though i asked them about it multiple times 
obviously by the time it came out we were already full and didn't end up eating much 
they don't bring out water, and give attitude if you ask for it 
then trying to get a water refill felt almost impossible 
their beef was literally raw. she tried to tell me that's how they serve it. i usually eat my meat medium rare.. but this was genuinely raw and the server argued for 5 minutes before she took it back to get cooked 
Over all this was a horrible experience and i will not be coming back."}
{"text":"A relatively small and cozy AYCE, the dark wood walls and black leather seats gave it a more classy feel. Food was surprsingly ok, but -1 for the pesky fruit fly that kept hovering. 

Best of the night: Garlic Beef Cubes!! super tender and juicy - how beef cubes should be!

Also ok: Garlic shrimp skewer, sweet potato tempura, eggplant, mackerel sashimi, white tuna tataki - on the sashimi menu but they serve it tataki style with some onion and sauce. 

Could pass on the baked scallop in shell (with some sour creamy sauce), dumpling, takoyaki.. The only roll I tried was spicy salmon which was ok but not spicy.. (just a pc of salmon with the orange mayo sauce..)

Bacon wrapped asapargus was so tiny.. 99% bacon with a tiny bite of asparagus (but still good, and some may prefer that) 

Sashimi selection included salmon (not the best), surf clam, mackerel, beef

Dessert selection was limited to icecream, jello, pudding (sold out that night). Black sesame icecream was good!!"}
{"text":"Lunch is all you can eat. $13.99 per adult. Pop is included and served in a can. Too much rice in sushi, but it is warm. Shogun House roll was disappointing. Otherwise, this place is good for its price."}
{"text":"How did I not know about this place earlier? This is almost a hidden gem located next to a gas station and across from a Costco!

listen I usually reserve the 5 star rating for \"the perfect place\" as it should be but this is a 4.5 for me and I wanted to round it up for a change.

literally nothing wrong with my visit here aside from the fact we arrived at last call for AYCE lunch. the take out they made us was stellar and really surprised by how nice and bright the decor is on the inside. the fact that it's close to offices and stores and is still pretty good value is great."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST!

Thanks to my friend's amazing attention to details we were able to walk away from this restaurant without being scammed.

We came here on a weekend (party of 4) around 8pm, waited for about 15 mins before being seated in a tiny \"party room\" (in reality it was a closet) with one other table. The other table's customers were already pissed off about the crappy services because they came before us, waited longer, but was only seated at the same time as we were. 

Anyways, once we sat down and looked through the menu, my friend saw the insane 12% services charge and 5% surcharge for using a credit card/interact. (we didn't carry enough cash) I understand business owners want to avoid paying taxes so they encourage customers to pay in cash but this is absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"While this is a Japanese/Chinese buffet, it stands out with the array of sushi/sashimi choices. If you take only one of EVERY one, it'll probably be a full meal for a reasonable person. Fortunately for me, I'm not a reasonable person and I take advantage of a buffet and absolutely STUFF myself with sushi/sashimi! Even after that, I find room for some Chinese food and dessert. Nothing is outstanding, but most items are very good. For a buffet, this is one of the best. Been here at least three times now and have never been disappointed. Good place for sushi lovers when one or more in the group doesn't eat sushi. There are plenty of other options in the Chinese buffet including hibachi."}
{"text":"Slow service, ordered and never received half the items.  They are more than happy to take our order again but still waiting.  Quality of food has gone down, service who knows where they are.... We r still waiting on our second order.  Never again... We just got our second order after 20+ minutes... There are tons of other ayce around, please take a look... Don't waste your time or money"}

Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. So I found this coupon that saves me $5 from a takeout order of 80 pieces so I decided to try that out. The platter comes with 30 pieces of sashimi, 18 pieces of sushi, and 32 rolls.

The platter itself looked pretty well aligned with a crap ton of wasabi (yay my fave!) and ginger on the side if you are a fancy sushi eater. For a long time I wasn't sure what the ginger is used for. But during my trip to Japan, I learnt that it is used to wash away linger tastes of sashimi and you take a piece between each piece. So now you know if you want to be fancy ;) Generally their rolls and sushi were average. I did enjoy their salmon sashimi a bit more than some other places though.

Although I did takeout here, I did not have a great experience with their service. Note that you can call in advance to place your order. However, they will not start making your under until you arrive making me wait another 20 minutes for it. Was not impressed.

The total price came out to $43 with the $5 coupon already applied. I'm not sure how I feel about this price. This equates to approximately 50 cents per piece which I feel is OK. However, given that it was not amazing quality either, I'd much rather do all you can eat for slightly cheaper plus more variety.

Overall the food was average but I would not do takeout here again especially without the coupon. Have yet to try out their all you can eat option, honestly don't know if I will considering this poor experience this time. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday for dinner. We made reservations and were seated promptly. They had iPad ordering here was was great since we didn't have to flag down a waiter. 

The service here was slow. Aside from drinks which came right away, food takes a while to get to the table. Drinks are included in the price and it comes in a can with the exception of nestea which came in a glass. 

Food was okay. The rolls were a bit big, the sashimi was decent, the eel sushi were small. Nothing really stood out. The kitchen items were average. 

Aside from the usual dessert items, they also had lychee jelly and black current jelly. It was nothing special and a bit dense for my liking. They also had black sesame ice cream which isn't offered at most places however, the quality wasn't the best and it tasted a bit icy. 

In terms of pricing, it was $26.99 for adults on weekdays plus tax and 12% tip which is already included in the bill, so no need to tip as it's already added! 

Bring cash if you can as they charge you extra 5% for using credit."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best hand rolls I've ever had. I find that opting for the regular menu over the ayce menu guarantees that you'll eat deliciously hand-crafted sushi and not an avocado-y rice mess on a plate, that you'll occasionally encounter at Syogun. I appreciate the Japanese rooms they've built, which offer privacy and is perfect for group settings. This place tends to get congested real fast and often times, waiters will forget your orders or simply take forever to bring your grilled eggplant.

Now the reason I've given Syogun 3 stars instead of 4 is that their customer service is horrendous. I've eaten at many sushi establishments with impatient, stressed-out, overworked waiters, but nothing can compare to this. If you can look past the staff's attitude, then you will surely taste some of the best hand rolls this towns got to offer."}
{"text":"Eaters beware... the customer service here is nearly non-existent. Make sure that on your first order, you order everything you want to eat -- especially if you are here during peak periods. It is extremely difficult to flag down a waiter willing to take your order a second time. 

At one point during my meal, my relatives and I were clearing our finished plates ourselves (another table hasn't been tidied up yet, and some waiters were just piling the dirty dishes on that table, so we did the same). If we didn't do that, we would have no room to put the rest of our dishes. 

Food-wise, it's not bad, but I wouldn't say it's amazing either, but I wasn't expecting much since it was relatively cheap for an ayce sushi lunch."}
{"text":"Weekend price $24.99 a person
Typical Japanese AYCE  with somewhat decent food and sub par service at times. And like most Japanese AYCE places you order 30 pieces of salmon sashimi and they bring out 20. However, one thing on the menu that many other places do not have is the sashimi shrimp. Texture was weird and it felt like eating a piece of butter. Now I know how my pet turtle Homer feels because all I feed him is shrimps....the cheap frozen kinds of course."}
{"text":"The buffet was mediocre however the wait time is beyond horrible....I understand I have to be patient however this was beyond that....came here twice and will be the last"}
{"text":"This place is quite different from when I last came here 2 years ago. The decor inside is quite nice haha. Some anime figures here and there or a random godzilla toy. The staff are quite friendly and can speak both English and Chinese.  

The food though is quite bomb. It comes out fast and fresh yum. My go to sushi is usually anything with eel in it. The Dragon roll we order was nice and smooth, so good. The sashimi tasted so nice and fresh. The salmon sushi didn't taste as good as the sashimi surprisingly.  All you can drink pop amen. The garlic beef teriyaki was so good. Literally each piece melted in your mouth. 

Recommend bringing cash as they charge you 5% more for card."}
{"text":"Came here to have the AYCE dinner. Their blowtorched sushi selection (spicy salmon, salmon, and shrimp) tasted amazing. Unfortunately they didn't have miso soup or cheese wontons which in my opinion is a must to have. The food was great. The service was quick. The price for a dinner was not bad compared to other places I've been to. The place is a bit small so there could be a wait. I'd definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Really good sushi buffet. I like that they bring the food to you, takes a lot of the chaos out of buffets. I wish they had a place like this in the states."}
{"text":"Syogun used to be a decent AYCE Japanese restaurant but recently, things have changed. 

First and foremost, they renovated the restaurant so now the restaurant looks modern... but there's a catch. The service suddenly became complete shit. Only two people taking people's orders in the whole restaurant. Extremely difficult to get their attention when they seem to avoid eye contact. They seem to \"purposely\" not bring all the food that we ordered. In general, the food tasted mediocre. 

Also, they added a service charge onto the bill so you are essentially forced to pay tips even though the service was complete shit. Now the weekend prices are $25.99 per person... pretty ridiculous for mediocre food.

So done with this place."}
{"text":"Dont know why they keep collect cash as payment, every night they keep cash at the cashier? we pay full payment without any special discount and request using our credit card and they refused and they force us to paid the service charge too and of coz the tax on top. CASH only should let us know ahead. May be Revenue agency should check them out!
ipad was not fully charged and need a replacement in the middle of the stay.  Even funny thing is that they take ipad away suddenly and we hv to ask it back!  What a service.  Food is ok but lesser and lesser
variety than before. total regular day dinner cost $33 @ cash deal only."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre.  There are many better options out there. Also they chronically short you on the amount you order. It became a game for us to over order enough to get the amount we actually wanted. Other times way more than we ordered showed up. Last thing to be aware of, they TAX on the tip amount they charge. They claim the government doesn't let them change it but I don't run into other restaurants to do this."}
{"text":"Visited this place long time ago and had the impression its just like any ordinary ayce japanese. We tried it again last Feb and to my surprise its actually good. From then on, this is my favorite go to place for ayce sushi. 3rd visit this year and more to come. Unlike other ayce run by chinese people, this place stands out. Service sometimes can be slow when its packed which usually is. TIP: Make reservation ahead of time. 

Try the specialty rolls... syogun and volcano... its my favorite. Salmon head and neck are delicious, always served hot and crispy.  I love the baked mussels, mayo and cheese mixed just the right way.  Drinks are included which are rare nowadays. Lychee jello is good too. 

Now this makes me hungry again... hmmmm"}
{"text":"Oh where to start. 

Waiting and getting ignored to be seated []
Having to ask for SOYA SAUCE several times at a sushi place? []
Takes 45 minutes to get first order []
No wifi though it's posted that there is []
Overspiced skewers []
Fried foods in old oil []

So I came with a couple of friends who recommended this place, we were all disappointed. If I could rate this lower I would."}
{"text":"I feel like downgrading all my other ayce reviews. This place has all the quality of a non ayce place. The food comes out super quick. The only thing that is slower is getting service when it's a full house, but once your order is in does the food ever come out fast. Everything is amazing. The baked scallops are wonderful but can be a bit overcooked. The wasabi muscles however have such a lovely soft texture not rubbery at all. Steamed egg was so flavourful. Jello and pudding were great with bits of real fruit/popping boba. Availability of black sesame ice cream is wicked. I loved the asparagus with bacon wrap! Scallop sushi is phenomenal.. all rolls and sushi come with MINIMAL rice!! Amazing ratio!! Beef tataki is done right, as is garlic beef cubes. The asparagus shrimp salad had elevated flavours and the mix of half cooked shrimp and crunchy asparagus and cucumber textures with a acidic soup is just wonderful. Even the patrons all seem more civilized rather than the rowdy crowd you might see characteristic of ayce places. Would come back in a heartbeat. The price is only slightly higher than other places and the 5% increase if not paying by cash and 12% service doesnt bother me.. just gotta remember to bring cash! And they deserve more than 12% anyhow!!

EDIT: I just want ppl to know this place seems kinda dirty. For some reason every time I come no matter where I sit there are always flies everywhere. I don't think their cleaning is thorough enough."}
{"text":"Went here with my girls for a sushi craving.

You literally sit asian-style on the floor which I found neat. 
There were 7 of us so they have us our own private booth - so we were tucked away on the side of the restaurant so we could yap as loud as we wanted.

NOTE - Bring someone that speaks cantonese or mandarin because their english is very poor and my asian friends (who are from Hong Kong) who you would say are 'white washed' even had a hard time trying to communicate with them.

Sushi was fresh and good.  They have a lot of traditional selection so their selection is somewhat different.  If you are a first time sushi eater and not very adventurous - don't go here.   This would be an upgrade from your simple salmon/tuna/california roll sushi :P"}
{"text":"WARNING: there is a 5% surcharge if you don't pay cash. They also automatically add in your tip. Dinner was $25.99/person, you'd think the tuna sashimi wouldn't be frozen. Service was OK until it got busy. Unimpressed overall. I would just avoid this place."}
{"text":"The sashimi is very fresh here and they also have sweet shrimp on the weekend!  Service was friendly and prompt on a Sunday night. However, they ran out of all but one flavour of ice cream.  Remember to bring cash and expect a 12% tip to be added on top."}
{"text":"The service and attitude of the workers there are not great.  Food is not bad for AYCE. Have the time, you don't get what you order.  So i started eating a la carte, and found that the size of the items is the same as the AYCE, which sucks cause they cheese out on the size, which is understandable for AYCE, but if a customer is ordering a la carte, make your pieces a bit normal looking size.
The take out platters are good!!  Price for the number of pieces is good.
I ordered a take out platter on NewYears and when i got home, i realized that they overcharged me.  I later mentioned it to a friend who orders from there also, and he said that they raised the prices of the takeout platters and did not tell anyone, or update the takeout menu,  

Bad Service keeps me from going there."}
{"text":"Love the idea of the iPod ordering as soon as you placed order food out with in minutes and you keep track of what u ordered, and the  grilled scallops were amazing, also the grilled octopus, and the cream cheese wrapped in salmon was Soo good, the fried milk custord was amazing ordered that with my ice cream and it was such a good combation. The only thing was when I ordered my sushi they missed one of my orders and gave it half an hour later while I was almost done dessert. Staff or not rude they seemed fine to me."}
{"text":"Saturday-dinner time. Arrived around 630pm and we were seated immediately. 
iPad ordering- nice to see pictures of each thing and the rolls had a description. Dinner time is very busy so it was difficult to get the attention of the waitstaff if you needed anything outside of the iPad. Also doesn't help that some of them do not understand English. 

Within 5 minutes of confirming your first order on the iPad, you start to get parts of your order. We mostly ordered kitchen/ fried foods/ appetizers and the torched sushi. The salmon one was good and of normal size. The others (spicy salmon, tuna and crab) tasted ok but they were the skinniest pieces of sushi I have ever seen. Wasabi mussels were interesting.

It took about 40 minutes to get the whole order, which was when we placed our second order that consisted of the specialty rolls, sashimi and other kitchen foods. Specialty rolls never arrived. Sashimi was not fresh. Ordered fried rice but had to ask 5 times for a fork. By the time the fork came, the rice was cold. Also very difficult to get a teapot refill. Had to ask 3 times. 

Since we knew things would take forever, we placed our final order of dessert at 826pm. At 9pm, I finally got the attention of the waitstaff and pointed it out so they quickly brought out the dessert. Black sesame ice cream was interesting. Besides ice cream, there was mango pudding, lychee jello, black current jello and two other puddings that weren't on the menu- green tea and some white milky one. I liked the mango pudding. 

So weekend dinner is $28.99 plus tax and a 12% service charge, which explains the crappy service. Why bother doing a good job if you are guaranteed a tip?! And if you pay by card, it's an extra 5%. So if you pay cash it's like $36 but by card it's $38. 

Most likely will NOT come back here again."}
{"text":"I've been to my share of sushi restaurants so I know what comes standard on the AYCE menus. The sushi is fresh and delicious! The scallops in cream sauce are my favourite! My biggest complaints have to do with the business itself and not the food. First off, the service is so bad. I'm not sure if it's because they're short staffed or what the situation is but it takes forever to get a server's attention and when you do you're rarely acknowledged. Had to ask for a glass of water 3 different times to 2 different servers and I got the water after my dessert . Secondly the restaurant needs some work (cleaning supplies all over the bathroom counter, ripped cushions, to name a few)."}
{"text":"I'm rating this place 4.5/5. Came in on Labour day at 7:30pm with a reservation and was quickly seated. 

Good qualities:
-cooked food was fresh and served hot (my group enjoyed the beef enoki rolls, garlic beef and baked scallop in particular. Garlic beef was SUPER tender)
-sashimi was fresh 
-speedy and accurate service (it's important that all our orders come)
-sweet shrimp served during weekends but not all you can eat 

Things to improve:
-steamed egg and seafood ramen could be stronger in taste  
-fish bone soup could be less salty and carry a stronger fish taste 
-unlimited sweet shrimp should be served 
-expand the dessert menu (not that we mind but for those who are looking for an exciting choice of dessert, this place only had ice cream, jello and mango pudding)"}
{"text":"The food that we got was pretty decent if we in fact got it... unfortunately, many of the items we ordered never made it to our table. Then getting a bill of nearly $40 per person ($38 with a service charge, tax and another 5% for using card), really made this entire experience less than satisfactory. It's very pricey considering you don't really get the things you've ordered. I wouldn't come back nor would I recommend it."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner during an \"all you can eat\" night. It was completely worth it! They had an excellent selection of sashimi, maki rolls, hand rolls, soups and dumplings. You order small portions via iPad and it is perfect for sharing to try a bunch of different items. 

The service is fast and friendly. They bring everything out as it is ready and you can order as you eat. 

The grilled calamari was great. Loved the sashimi salmon and white fish. Good maki selection and I love the mango California roll and shrimp tempura roll with the bbq eel. I tried the udon soup and it was great.

To finish they have green tea and mango ice cream and pudding. Nice finisher."}
{"text":"A bit pricer than the average AYCE place but the quality is there.  The cooked meat dishes were very good and I was impressed by the quality.  Being a big sushi fan I found myself indulging in more of the meat dishes as they are generally done pretty well.  Scallops not worth ordering so don't expect to like them too much.  I'd come again though."}
{"text":"came here on mother's day and i believe the price was 35.99 per person which is more expensive than their regular prices. but it was mother's day so i understand. service was ok, however they served the sashimi super slow so by the time we got it we weren't even hungry anymore. the food was normal, not bad but not amazing, some sushi rolls were good and the beef sashimi was good. also their nestea is not real nestea but on the menu it was the official nestea logo so i was a little disappointed. wouldn't come back again but i don't regret coming. forgot to say there is also not a large selection of desserts....."}
{"text":"Fish was fresh and food was as expected. There's decent variety but they no longer have sweet shrimp (sashimi). A pleasant surprise was their torched sushi! It's BETTER THAN KAKA. So if you don't want to wait or have to book a table, just come here instead! The cost per adult is now $26.99 on a weekday night. All our food came quickly after ordering through an iPad. Service was average but please note: they do charge you an automatic service charge. It's pre-set and already calculated on your receipt. That is really my only complaint, so I took a star off of my review."}
{"text":"Came here for a family day lunch with good friends. Came at around 1pm thinking lunch rush was about to die down but had to wait for a good 30 min. for a table. I thought the wait was worth it though. The quality of the food was really good especially by AYCE standards. And I agree to one yelper saying they have a good variety of food even for Lunch.  I would have given this place 4 stars but the service brought it down a notch..so I'd say around 3.5. we had to repeatedly ask our server for the seafood fried rice (I think asked about 4 times) until finally they probably thought we wouldn't leave until we had our fried rice (we take our fried rice seriously, lol!) So the dish finally came right before the bill.  Their rolls were great, the Syogun roll was actually a torched which usually gets offered on a pricier menu. Their Black Sesame Ice cream was dead on with the flavour. I am a big fan of this , so  you can say I'm palate picky for black sesame. You know what they say about going black.... We will be back !  ;-D"}
{"text":"I'm a frequent customer here, and solely come back here because of the fresh food.

Their service is not top notch, but I've gotten to know the servers after coming here many times. They know it's me whenever I call for reservations without me having to tell them.

The reason why I come back is because of the selection of food that they offer.  Their baked scallops are amazing, sashimi is ALWAYS fresh, there's never one day that it's not.  The salmon is nice and proportioned, fatty, and the beef sashimi is made JUST right.  

Their mango pudding desserts are in tiny shot glasses but taste delicious.  Prices are average compared to other AYCE restaurants. I've been to many other Japanese AYCE, but this is definately the place to visit if you're looking for fresh sashimi and wide selections of cooked foods.

Their new renovation has made it even roomier and prettier!

MUST TRY if you haven't been.
But remember to call them to make reservations in advance, otherwise you're looking at a minimum wait of 30 minutes on Fri, Sat, Sun."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the few AYCE restaurants that offer better quality sashimi! I especially like their sweet shrimp (only available on weekends). I've been here often with family when we crave for some sushi/sashimi on week nights and weekends. 

I have to say that service isn't always the best and our food has been missed once or twice, but the quality makes up for it. 

The sashimi is what really keeps customers coming back, including myself. If you're looking for ayce and also the area, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I think this is the best AYCE for now. The only thing is because weekends have sweet shrimp and scallop sushi. Went to this place twice and the first time was really good. The quality of the fish was pretty fresh. Went with a group of 10+ and we made reservations but still have to wait for an hour even with our full party here.

Went again yesterday and the quality of the scallop wasn't that fresh. Had a funny taste but its AYCE so meh. Went with a group of 4 and although the menu did say 1.5 hours they actually enforced it and gave us our last call which was 1 hour into our meal. Somewhat unexpected as they never usually enforce these things but still lots of people waiting at the door.

Decent service though and the manager (i think is the owner) is a pretty nice and good guy."}
{"text":"Food taste and presentation soso. 30-40 % of my order didn't come. Ask them follow up and nothing happens. They put tips in and +13% tax on top over tips. If you want to pay by credit card they want to charge 5% on top. Not a good experience. No recommended."}
{"text":"My friend recommended we try this place out, and since I haven't been here in a few years (and have completely forgotten my experience since), why not! 

Then I realized why I haven't been back; it isn't very good. It's a very average place. Nothing in the menu stood out to me and the flavours of the sushi/sashimi or cooked dishes were nothing special. The beef sashimi was decent, some of their torched and pressed sushi was good, and their scallops were interesting too. 

However, a few pieces of the salmon sashimi were dry (how is this even possible) and the sashimi had almost a \"film\" on top of it....it was gross, I had to spit it out. I love ayce and I love feeling stuffed, but for the first time I felt SICK every time I tried to consume another piece of sushi/sashimi. The quality just isn't good, and I was unsure if everything I was eating was fresh (what was that thin film doing there??!!?). My stomach naturally wanted to reject the food. 

This sushi place is approx. $3 cheaper than those \"higher end\" AYCE sushi places (it's $25.99 on weekdays). So understandably, the selection will not be as vast (desserts are just ice cream and some pudding), and maybe you can't expect the quality to be as great. But I just felt weird and was grossed out by the food at the end. Maybe I'll give this place another chance......but I'll wait another few years."}
{"text":"Came as a group worth work colleagues. Service and food was standard. This place has been around for a long time. Nothing that really makes this place standout over other places, but if your local and don't want to travel to far, it'll do."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, all the food was hot and fresh. Nice variety of hot food and different kinds of sushi, they even had torched sushi for lunch which was pretty good. My only concern was the charges on the bill. There's an extra 5% they charge for paying with your credit card and already 12% tip added onto the bill. Will keep that in mind if I go again."}
{"text":"Syogun looks decent from out front, but after you have seated you definitely wish they give you a gun to shoot yourself in the face. The ordering system, unlike other more AYCE friendly establishments with ordering sheets / iPads was ... yup, you wait for a someone to take your order by hand.  This is fine if the service is ok, but unfortunately it took them 15 mins before they came to take our first order.  We almost forgotten the list of dishes we wanted.  Food came out quickly, but subsequent ordering adventures didn't improved and nearly took 30 mins to have a server take our 2nd order.  Picture going onto a rollercoaster ride, once you are strapped in, you are going for a ride whether you like it or not. Looking around, since we have lots of time, we weren't the only patrons who needed attentions from their staffs.  At the end, our 2nd order was our last and had to walk up to request our bill (we did ask for the bill with our 2nd order but didn't come).  The worst part was 12% service fee is included on the bill which we believe they did not earn, at least for the front of the kitchen staffs.  Will not be back. Ever! I want my 1.5 hrs back."}
{"text":"Syogun Sushi Bar is both a AYCE and à la carte full service and take out restaurant located in a plaza with ample free parking. I came here because I had a gift certificate for a free sushi platter. I wanted to dine in, but the coupon had indicated that it was for take out only.

The decor was more modern, and the place is quite dark, even around lunch time as the windows were well tinted.

The fixed platter we received had a combination of both Sushi, Rolls, and Sashimi.
The sashimi consisted of your staples: Salmon (Sake), Serf Clam (Hokkigai); Red Snapper (Tai), and the less common Octopus (Tako). They also included the cheaper Butter Fish (aka Escolar) instead of Red Tuna which was disappointing to me.
The Salmon and the Butter Fish were decent size slices, not the biggest I've had, but not the smallest either. The salmon was of a nice color with lines of fat throughout indicative that it was farm raised rather than wild caught based on the size. 3,5 stars. Not a fan of butterfish, it was very wet (as expected), so no comment here. 3 stars. The red snapper was smaller than the salmon, but also expected as it a more expensive fish ($/yield) and is typical of what is found in Sushi Bars. 3,5 stars. The Serf Clam comes packaged as with all places and is on par. 3 stars. Lastly the Octopus was a welcome addition. Not as common, as it's more expensive, it was a welcome addition which makes up for the Butter Fish. It was also sliced on par ensuring that it's not too chewy 4 stars.

The Sushi hit many of the staples as well. Salmon, Red Snapper, Shrimp, Serf Clam, Crab, and Squid. The Crab is really processed fish, but it's what is served. The fish slices for the Sushi were slightly smaller than the sashimi, but that's right on par with how it should be. Again, they offset it nicely by including something less common and more expensive, the Squid. The squid was actually quite good, not too slimy. Despite being more of a Sashimi guy, overall, I give the sushi 4,5 stars.

I'm keeping this review short on purpose as I may come back for the AYCE and will need some space to say a few things about that.

If you would like to experience more, come dine-with-me.yelp.com I'd love to have your company... Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Had dinner again here this evening. Food was as good as before although the service was a bit on the slow side. One tip: when you order something, make sure you specify a quantity. For example, I ordered \"Wasabi Mussels\", which is an appetizer. Note the plural form of the dish, which is also on their menu. I received exactly one Wasabi Mussel. Ditto for sushi--make sure you specify a quantity or you will receive just one piece of whatever you order. No big deal but it's good to know going in.

The sushi was good and fresh, as was the sashimi. I also ordered a couple of their rolls and garlic beef from their \"kitchen\" menu. I finished with a scoop of mango ice cream.

One small nit: their menu states $21.95 during the week, and yet my bill came to $27. I'm not sure if the difference was tax (beverage was supposed to be included in the price), but that was a bit of a surprise. I'm not from the area so maybe that's the normal amount of tax. 

I'll definitely be back on my next trip to Markham."}
{"text":"from the raving reviews I read before we stepped in, I was super excited to try a great ayce sushi place in Markham. Wa\lking in on a sunday night prime time dinner, I automatically second doubted the raving reviews.

I'm not sure if the management has changed, but the food is definitely not 3.5 star-worthy.

What caught my attention was the ayce sweet shrimp sashimi option, which is typically not found in ayce sushi restaurants. But the quality of the sweet shrimp was quite disappointing, If there's different sweet shrimp sashimi grade, this would be the lowest.. can't expect much from ayce places.

The menu is hard to read, it's simply printed with no pictures. The variety of food isn't wowing either. Maybe I just caught them in a bad night, but I would definitely recommend going to either sushi legend or matsuda a little further down"}
{"text":"I would have to agree with some of the other reviews here. 

The food selection is Good, the quality is a 3.5/5. The service is Fine, meaning they don't come around much, to see if you need anything.

The dinning room is Nice, nothing really special.

What I was turned off from was the fact they include a service fee and still ask for a tip when paying with the machine. While I was entertaining, I didn't focus on the machine and included an additional 15% on top of their own. Yes that's my error, bit considering we were only four ppl, I don't understand 'A', why are they forcing you to pay a minimum service fee when they rarely come to service you. And 'B', they should remind you the service fee is already included, but if you would like to too more you're welcome.

Overall. I may go back if I'm in the area. But likely not that often, nor would recommend."}
{"text":"This place is on par with all other ayce so it's pretty much mediocre and average. Come here if you're craving any kind of ayce. Only special part about this place is that they have scallop sushi (not sashimi) and sweet shrimp and octopus on weekends. Not even sure why octopus is weekends only, I've never been to an all you can eat that makes octopus expensive. Their sashimi selection is rather small, less than 10 items. Drinks are free. Waiters are a bit rude and don't like to smile - a bit impatient with you. 

They charge you a mandatory 12% tip... Oh and another 5% if you use credit card. Wtf? Why? It's either you pay by card and there's tax or you pay by cash no tax. This is really unreasonable, I don't ever see a restaurant charge money just for using a card, super cheap management. Enough of a reason for me to not come back. Save your money on somewhere worthwhile of your $$$$."}
{"text":"For AYCE, pretty decent sushi joint. It was PACKED tho on a Sat night, even tho we had reservations for 5:30pm (I mean, who EATS AT 5:30?!), so make sure you call ahead. Cus it was so busy, service was slow and we had several missed orders which was sucky. But of the stuff that did come out, the torched sushi was definitely tasty. Prices are different from what is listed in the photos of these reviews, so call ahead! Bring cash or it's 5% extra and tip is already included in the price."}
{"text":"Syogun restaurant has a great variety of foods to try that you do not typically get. The wasabi mussels is interesting. The beef sashimi is very tasty too. Good is high quality and the service is quick. Just bring cash and remember that a service charge is included in your bill or you end up double tipping"}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times and have always left happy. The food is good, sushi is fresh. We usually get teriyaki shrimp, fried shrimp, shrimp tempura, teriyaki salmon, and salmon cheek. Notice a trend here? The shrimp tempura is really good. You can tell that they use fresh oil. They have a huge variety of sushi, much larger than most other AYCE places I've been to. I have also tried their hand rolls and sushi rolls and they're also tasty. As someone else mentioned, service is very prompt at the beginning, but starts to wane towards the end."}
{"text":"0/5 stars. 

Horrible customer service, food delivery, and quality. 

My friends and I visited Syogun for the first time in two years and it was a huge disappointment. First off, one of my friends (we were in a party of 4) wanted to use a coupon that Syogun was advertising. She showed the waiter on her phone and he said it must be presented in person. To be fair, the coupon did not say that it must be present physically, but I guess we could have let it go. 

However, the waiter's response was, \"I told them to fix it in the magazine.\" By saying that, you're just trying to push the responsibility off you.. and saying that you told them to fix it when it was already printed, made it even worse on yourself. 

Food delivery was awfully slow, and we got wrong orders ALL night. The table beside us got all of our orders at least four times, including sashimi and cook food. 

The waiter didn't give two shits, since they were going to get a 12% tip no matter how amazing or crap the service was. 

The food quality was alright though, but the kitchen was unable to keep up with orders, our orders got given away, and the fish wasn't always fresh. 

The breaking point was when the waiter gave us our order of sashimi, it had fish that we didn't order. He walked it back to the chef (who was right behind us), and the chef said, \"Why the fuck is this my problem?\". We left immediately afterwards. It was one way to ensure that your customers will never come back, and we were afraid of causing discomfort to other customers. 

I urge you to never visit this establishment."}
{"text":"SCAM ALERT!

This review rests solely on the Establishment's variance in pricing:

I came here with my wife for dinner on Monday, June 8th, 2015. I wanted to try this place because of the good reviews and friends also recommended this place for good quality sushi for AYCE. Food was good, nothing spectacular but it's what you would expect from an AYCE sushi place.

What I have a HUGE issue with, is their pricing which is a borderline  Ponzi scheme.

Price was marked on the menu $23.99 pp for Weekdays

When came time for my bill it read:

$47.98 (Dinner for two)

$5.75 Service and gratuities fee (for 2 people?)

$6.23 (HST)

$59.96 Total

First I thought why the hell am I paying a service fee for a party of 2? How do you Predetermine the percentage of tip I pay? I understand many places and establishments with larger parties like 6+ they usually charge Tip and Gratuities but this was the two of us. Anyway I'm like \"Ok ,that's like 12%, whatever\"  

When I went to pay with my card the guy was like, \"Oh it;'s 5% more if you don't pay cash\" so I had to pay $62.96 total.

What kind of bullshit is this? I get penalized 5% for wanting to pay by card now? Not only did you already scam me 12% for predetermining my tips I get dinged for another 5%

All I have to say is because of that and that alone, I will not be coming here again. It's a shame too because the food was actually pretty good and the service was decent. I just don't agree with how they do business"}
{"text":"Below average all you can eat sushi. The rolls were not that tasty especially the rice. BBQ short ribs were pretty good And same with the fried chicken. But what made the dinner extremely uncomfortable was the service and the fact that even with the terrible service they charged you a 12% service tip. The staff does not pay attention at all and plates start filling up on the table. They don't greet you or acknowledge you. It's a tablet order system yet they act like they're extremely busy"}
{"text":"Terrible service for very mediocre food!!! There are plenty of other japanese places in the area to choose from!! 

So i have been here twice, once for lunch and the other for dinner. 
The lunch was not terrible because it was not very busy. But even then, we needed to try very hard to grab the waiter's attention. The sushi was fairly fresh but the beef was way too overcooked we could barely swallow it. 
My dinner experience here was much worse. My friend and I waited 20 minutes for someone to even take our order and then another 20 minutes for them to realize that nothing was served to us. But when the food did come it would be half of what we ordered and some we didnt even ask for. It was seriously ridiculous. When I asked about the reason for such a delay they simply told us to wait without any apologies. It was so frustrating because i ordered sashimi such as uni and octopus and they gave me crabsticks, shrimps and other things i didnt want.

Overall the price is not worth it esp for dinner and they charge extra for debit AND they have already included tips!!! I still cringe when i think about my dinner experience here."}
{"text":"Food quality is above par compared to other AYCE sushi bars I've been to,but the service is horrible. Came in here with 8 other \"white\" friends and we were ignored for 20 minutes upon walking in. Once we order our first round of sushi, we had to wait another 25 mins till it came. 

The service here is atrocious. 

They also have a mandatory 12% service charge and if you're paying anything besides cash, you can expect to add another 5% service charge on top. That's 17% service charge on top of your bill, which is a total rip off. 

This place won't last much longer. Avoid. This is Markham. Lots of other great caliber sushi joints in the area!"}
{"text":"4.5 if they had more staff on busy nights.

We had a reservation for dinner on a Friday night. Relatively small-size restaurant with 4 waiters which sounds reasonable but only 2 of them took orders. Fortunately they provided good service and only forgot about one of our orders.

The sweet shrimp was excellent in size and quality and made the price worth it. The salmon and beef sashimi were above average quality and the rest of the fish was average quality. The handrolls weren't bad with a minimal amount of rice inside. They have about 9 different variations of maki rolls. The two I tried weren't great but they gently filled my stomach. There was a wide variety of tempura but it was only about average. The hot food was mostly pretty good. The steak with garlic was made perfectly medium rare. One complaint is that the portions of noodles (udon & ramen) are too big for an AYCE, meaning you won't have as much room to eat other things. The dessert options were limited with ice cream, mango pudding and jello. The pudding was delicious. The jello...not so much.

Please note that you will be charged 5% more if you use any form of payment other than cash. A service charge of 12% will be automatically added to your bill. Seating time is limited to 1.5 hours but they never asked us to leave even though we went over the time. This is all written in the fine print on the menu. Personally, I don't think any of these conditions are dealbreakers but they might be for some folks.

I agree with the other reviewers in that the quality of the sashimi makes this place worth going to. The selection of the hot food impressed me too. Can't wait to go back to eat more of their sweet shrimp."}
{"text":"Great all you can eat Sushi. Never been disappointed. The food is delicious and service exceeded all expectations. Their service has attended all needs and questions asked. I especially love their all you can eat Sweet Shrimp Sashimi on weekends."}
