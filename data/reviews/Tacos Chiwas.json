{"text":"Some of the best tacos in town highly recommended. Take the whole family here to eat because you can't beat there prices! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Wow!  And another WOW! This place was fantastic. The real deal! Authentic food and friendly service. We will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"GREAT vegetarian options AND corn tortillas! This place rocks your Chiwas! Walk, bike, ride, fly, teleport your way here and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best taco/taquerias in Phoenix. Very authentic and  delicious. From the fresh homemade corn tortillas to the fillings of the tacos. It's all legit and homemade. Phoenix does not have as many places that are this good for tacos. As the city matures and the baby boomers offspring demands a cooler scene, restaurants like this emerge. It's getting into the type of neighborhood that incubates instituations like this. I add this to my list of Phoenix institutions like Ritos."}
{"text":"It was just ok. The people were nice and helpful. But the tacos were just ok! I wouldn't go out of my way to go here for great tacos."}
{"text":"Tacos are amazing! Very quaint location. The staff is friendly and, did I mention the tacos are amazing!!?"}
{"text":"This place is soooo good! Walked in and it smelled like delicious food. The staff was really nice and welcoming and the food was crazy good. I ordered 3 different types of tacos: asada, carnitas, and pastor. I also got the beans and a gordita de rajas which was unbelievable. I thought it couldn't get any better until I tried a tacochiwa taco. I'll be coming back forsure.. This place is my new favorite place for tacos!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The flavors are amazing! I wanted to try everything on the menu! Stop by for lunch or dinner, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Place is small but the food is amazing I'll be back with my family... Glad to see local businesses do great"}
{"text":"Great food! Service so bad it's insulting!! If you ask for anything custom - anything - it's either a long ordeal or they just refuse to do it. For example, my hubby likes extra onions on everything, try to ask for that & u get answers like 'umm I'm not sure' , 'ummm we don't do extra' , 'ummm i guess I could ask'!! Seriously irritating! We go to chiwas nearly 3-4/wk and the service keeps getting worse! Last week I (a customer) helped the customer in front of me out to her car w her catering order because the girl at the counter couldn't be bothered!?!?   Also consistency is a huge issue, from order to order the exact same items vary immensely - great many times, passable others. It's a crap shoot!  Seriously wth do I spend my $$ here! Armando if you are reading this - please instill some service & consistency standards in your staff to accompany your delish food!!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit so we took some time to look at the menu. The young woman at the counter offered no help, didn't greet us or seem to be interested in us at all. Two customers brought their food back stating it was too pink for them and wanted to exchange it. She was so rude they instead asked for a refund.  We placed our order and the food came quickly. I had a ground beef and potato burrito which proved to have a soggy tortilla. My husband really enjoyed his taco but didn't care for the seasoning in his asado burrito. Based on the poor counter service and just OK food, we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Best tacos I have had in a long time very taste good. The app says they are closed on Mondays but they are open."}
{"text":"I think ive discovered taco heaven. Hands down best tacos ive ever had! I got the pastor. Not many places get pastor right-usually too dry or oily. This taco melted in my mouth. Salsa bar had a good variety of hot yet flavorful salsas. Found this place on my way to Tucson. This will definitely be my to go spot whenever im in town. Do yourself a favor and stop by!!"}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars because it took almost 30 minutes to get our food once we ordered and there was one person ahead of us. Once we ordered we sat down but we were never given our drinks until all the food came out.  While the food was delicious - we at the Carne Asada burritos - it wasn't worth waiting 30 minutes.  And while we were waiting, the owner (a guy) came out of the kitchen to talk to the other people sitting in the dining room. I know he was an owner b/c he mentioned it a few times. He chatted with them for about 25 minutes but never acknowledged my daughter and me. $20 for two average size burritos and a horchata isn't too bad but overall just nothing special. Probably won't go back.  The restaurant itself was OK. Some people might be freaked out by the bars on the window but they're not really a big deal. The parking is tight but it works out OK. Getting out of the place can be a bit tough with traffic though."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVED the food! They have hand made corn tortillas and they personally bring out frijoles charros before your meal. Very clean & very friendly faces. Best meal i've had in a very long time!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Their tacos are so good I ate them without salsa! The frijoles charros are excellent as is the horchata. I want my apartment to smell like this restaurant!"}
{"text":"By far the best tacos and gorditas. Hand made corn tortillas. Very clean. Great service."}
{"text":"Tacos Chiwas has quickly become my favorite place for Taco Tuesday. I would recommend that you try the tripas tacos."}
{"text":"Nice selection of meats for your tacos, lengua, tripa, al pastor, carnitas etc, etc. I had a sip of a Jamaica drink, which was great, to go with my tacos. I say a sip cause there was so much ice in my drink that there was only room for a sip of a very tasty Jamaica. But! there's always a but to these reviews. But the corn tortillas were mushy and lukewarm! Tortillas are essential to good tacos! The meats, the fillings alone don't make a taco, you need a good tortilla to back it up! Ideally you have home hand made tortillas but not everyone is able to provide them I understand! At the very least give me a HOT tortilla.   I give them 2 stars for their meats otherwise known as an 'incomplete taco.'  I give them 1 star for the Jamaica, you give me more Jamaica I give you more stars! Comprendes Mendez?  Chiwas please pay more attention to your tortillas!  In this election year I vote for more HOT tortillas and less COLD ice!  Thank you, Harry S"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Phoenix!  My go to tacos are chicken, Tripas and Asada.   The gorditas never disappoint!    Great customer service. The owners are a huge part of this since they are part of the workforce.   Much love! Thank you for the love."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious gorditas. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for something delicious and spicy."}
{"text":"Really good tacos, that were prepared quickly. Had the asada, carnitas, and chiwas tacos.  Demolished them all within a couple minutes. These reminded me of the street tacos I had in Baja. Salsa bar is on point as well. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Tacos Chiwas. I placed an order so I could pick it up because I'm at work. I told them when I would be there to pick it up & it was hot & ready to go when I got there. I got the yummy salsas & cucumbers too in a bag to go. I got to work & took my first bite & it was so fresh & tasty I had to write a review. I had the Picadillo burrito with onions & it's my new spot since it's right down the street from work.  P.S. The customer service was really awesome too!"}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood, Tacos Chiwas. This place is legit and we are lucky to have such delicious, hand made food so close to home. Don't miss the namesake tacos chiwas, fresh salsa bar, and an icy horchata to balance out the heat. The friendly Service matches the quality of the food. A definite must try."}
{"text":"Like the food but very disappointed today. They gave my takeout order to someone else and after waiting 15 minutes they told me the guy was bringing my food back. No way will I accept food some stranger has taken home. Now I'm waiting for fresh food to be made with no offer for concession. This might be my last time. UPDATE: the food was excellent as always so rating upped to 3."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! Loved the taco chiwas! Would highly recommend. Great customer service too."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place after hearing about the great reviews and was not disappointed. The place was spotless and the service was friendly. I ordered the carne asada burrito, tripas and pastor tacos. Everything came out fresh and accompanied with lemon wedges. Their salsa bar was awesome! I tired all 3 salsas and loved the red one (the most spicy). The asada burrito had a great balance of flavors and the al pastor taco was in point. The tripas were not as crunchy as I usually like them but they were fresh and had a good taste. Great place to get good authentic tacos and burritos!"}
{"text":"I work in the industry and I have been asked by many people I have been to tacos chiwas ... so I decided to give it a try... I had the tacos de tripa and picadillo gordita...  and my wife had taco Al pastor and rajas gordita...  everything was very good....  the hand made tortillas and salsas.... it was worth the visit we'll definitely be back soon... best tacos around..."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos! Had the tripas  (extra crunchy)  and asada tacos, the handmade tortillas were perfect!"}
{"text":"Y'all, I'm shook.   From the pictures, I wasn't expecting much from what appears to be some scrawny tacos.   BUT THEY WERE SO FLAVORFUL. I tried the Chiwas, Barbacoa & Asada. All amazing in their own special ways. The Chiwas was salty, the Barbacoa was buttery, and the Asada was perfectly cooked. Grabbed the red salsa for heat and entered taco heaven. They were so good we ordered a second time. Definitely excited to come back for more."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant that we ate at immediately after we landed in Phoenix and got our rental car. Family owned operation that produced quality food for our visit, and we would certainly go back. We had a little bit of everything and tried out some tacos, a burrito, and a gordita. The picadillo burrito was loaded with flavor, the carrots and potatoes added another layer that made it taste amazing. The Taco Chiwas was really good, and the cheese was melted perfectly atop the meats for a great bite ever time. Don't forget to hit up the salsa bar in the corner, they put out fresh roasted peppers while we were sitting down and I had quite a few, they were great with the green salsa from the bar on my taco. The outside might look like a prison with all the bars on the windows as one reviewer said, but that's because they got the food inside on lock down!"}
{"text":"We love it here! It's an added bonus that it is walkable from our house :-). The food is amazing but even more the service! So nice and friendly. We have been twice and plan many more times to come."}
{"text":"Super good. Street taco styles. The pastor was delicious in particular! Suggest trying it!"}
{"text":"The lack of salt is offending. But I will share what offended me the most. The girl trained to push the buttons on the order taking machine needs to seek therapy. Whether or not She was abandoned amongst wolves as a toddler or...she has a face forward dislike for gabachos, I cannot be certain of either. I would like to compliment the red sauce but the heartburn makes her face reappear in the sad recollections as I lay dying from tacos chiwas. The recent gabacho consumption of the well marketed Taco Shop is to be appreciated. Appreciate it as much as the gloomy Skies. I have certainly noticed a degradation of the walls and the trim and the tables and the floors and the accouterments about the place. Once upon a time I went to tacos chiwas and thought it was -1 against its closest Mexicano of Rivals in South and West Phoenix. But now I realize that they have capitalized on a sentiment that runs deep in the office folk that work in Central Phoenix slightly off to the east. They want tacos they want them fast and they want to glare at your woman because it's the last thing that's walked in on boots that are made of anything that appeared here edible in a long time as you drag your bags of saddness out of your office coup. I can't blame you for your clientele but I can blame you for the barbacoa that tasted more like machaca from a decade ago that had been stepped on with the smelly feet of the vagrants in the parking lot. And as I took my first swallow I realize that the fat man with the bald head and the girl that was once the daughter of a lobo all stood witnessing me take my worst bite of anything that McDowell and 20th Street has to offer."}
{"text":"This place is a must for an excellent lunch or decent dinner. Its a small place but the taste of their food is great. Not greasy at all. Have been there 3 times now with 3 different groups of people and they have yet to disappoint! Had their Gorditas de desebrada en chile rojo (red chili shredded beef), super delicious. I will keep on recommending and taking my friends and family. Tacos Chiwas you're doing an excellent job!   P.s. Tortillas recien hechesitas (freshly made tortillas). Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Everything made to order. Handmade tortillas. Had the asada,  the pastor and the taco-chiwas. Hands down a must eat."}
{"text":"Best tacos in phx. Highly recommended the pastor and chiwas is my favorite.  Dank AF and i dream about these tacos."}
{"text":"best tripas in town. their staff is friendly and awesome. i recommend you ask for extra crispy, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is so freaking good that I've been there three times this week. Everything I've had is fantastic. I've told all my friends about this place because it's that good. I love the Bean Soup and the gorditas."}
{"text":"Everyone has been talking about this place so we finally decided to give it a try. We wanted to sample most of their tacos but I was sad to hear that they were out of Barbacoa :(. We ordered the asada, pastor, carnitas, and chiwas tacos. My fiancé also ordered a bean and cheese burrito which I had a bite of and loved it. Simple, but you'd be surprised how easily people can mess it up.   The tacos were pretty good but my favorite was the carnitas. The flavor of the meat was perfect! I wish I would've ordered more of those but I will just have to wait until next time. They have a salsa bar in the corner, similar to many other taco shops. Stop by and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Heard about this joint through a friend who lives in Chandler, funny because this place is literally by my moms house and never seen it or heard about it. The place was quaint and clean, the cashier was very cool and laid it down to what tacos are best so ordering was simple and lemme say they don't mess. Tacos were delicious, their salsas on point and they have this sick guac salsa that's pretty good. I say take a drive to CenPho and visit this place asap."}
{"text":"Good food but with all the hype was expecting better.  Favorite meat was the pastor.  Good salsa bar.  Good homemade tortillas. Priced well.  Will give them another chance."}
{"text":"A taco shop with authentic tacos..but no chips and salsa on the menu??? No salsa at all. Filiberto style cart of sauces radishes and delicious roasted jalepenos.bit lost me at the lack of choices. And lack of chips and salsa. The food  was good tasting but I need to get full on my 3 tacos, they are appetizer sized. Anyways. I don't go to any Mexican shops that dont have chips and salsa.. If that's not a major fail  for you the tacos are good..."}
{"text":"Parking- there is parking on site   Customer service - everyone was very friendly and helpful. They even bring your food to your table.   Food - I ordered a carne asada burrito and a sprite. The meat was marinated so it tasted good. I didn't like the lettuce and tomatoes in my burrito. I did ask for just the meat and cheese. They also don't have guacamole. The burrito was small compared to other places. The sprite came in a glass bottle."}
{"text":"Great Authentic Tacos, Gorditas, and Quesadillas for cheap. Rated by food network as great comfort food. Fast service, likeable staff."}
{"text":"Walked in to a smokey wonderful smelling place and had a couple really good tacos!  You may need to get 3 or 4 to make a meal but well worth it."}
{"text":"I give it very low rating because of the size, taste and lack of taste the tacos have. If I pay that much for a taco I expect it to be good but not perfect. The tortillas are hand made but not fresh tasting. Don't even get me started on the watered out, nasty horchata drink I got. This is probably the last time I go here. It sucks that they have the Chiwas promotion as if in chihuahua they would actually serve something so plain. This rating is strictly based on food and nothing else. Customer service is kind of what you would expect out of a small business with lack of training. It is a new place so not much on the cleanliness of the facility."}
{"text":"Wonderful tacos.  Used to go to bbq spot and was mildly upset it closed. They have redeem themselves by sharing the best taco ever just had.  Tender marinated to perfection and bursting with the right flavors"}
{"text":"I absolutely love authentic Mexican food however I am disappointed to say Tacos Chiwas let me down. My pollo taco although tiny for $2.50 was flavorful.  Unfortunately my Asada gordita was soft & missing the usual hardness (like other places) and the meat was very greasy, fatty, chewy, & tasteless. Just yuck!! Will not be back. Oh & if you dont eat pork dont get the bean soup it's loaded with ham."}
{"text":"The tacos didn't disappoint, good heat and tortillas.  However, not sure about he gorditas were slimy, I didn't finish."}
{"text":"We tried their pollo, pastor, asada, and carnitas tacos.  They were all delicious.  I think about four of the tacos is a fairly filling meal.  I will definitely be back.  Great flavor and friendly staff.  Great price too."}
{"text":"Best tacos. Highly recommended and I would definitely go again.  Great tacos and good variety."}
{"text":"Taco Chiwas is a very small establishment. The tacos are okay. I do like that the tortillas corn or flour are made fresh to (order for  tacos). I got to admit I was disappointed when I found out they? didn't serve rice. At least the refried beans were good. The cashier was nice. The seating is very limited."}
{"text":"I been coming here since day 1 and never had issues until recently and I keep coming back to see if things have changed, but for the 3rd time I get cold tortillas on my tacos  No bueno ! Come on guys lets warm them babies up like you used to please. I remeber they use to be perfectly calientito y sabroso  !  SOS ..FOODIE IN DISTRESS!"}
{"text":"Good prices on food and amazing tacos. The asada tacos are my favorite, the asada quesadillas are really great too. Cute patio seating area and friendly service!"}
{"text":"By far the best mexican place in the valley!  Cheap and delicious!  I make the drive at least 2 times a month to get the al pastor and gordita."}
{"text":"I snuck into Taco's Chiwas before Guy's legions of fans invaded (Thank GOD). I read they had the bestest barbacoa tacos & salsas. I found everything to be tasty, clean & some updated bathrooms. I really liked that they had a variety of veg &  salsas at the salsa bar. The evening we went in it wasn't crowded at all & didn't have to wait in line. The Pastor was juicy, fresh with the perfect sweet spicy you expect from a good Pastor. Definitely going to return & try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Love love this place! Hands down the best hand made gorditas in town! You must try everything! From tacos al pastor are to die for. Will definitely came back!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy but pretty good.  Disappointed that there is no salsa or chips, only hot sauce.  Had chicken tacos and carne asada burrito.  Would go back again."}
{"text":"This place is the Bomb! The taco Chiwas is better than sex. it changed my life. The Lengua and Gordian were fantastic as well. I new the place was legit when we saw the owners mom making fresh tortillas. The have Horchata and jarritos and a full salsa bar. SPECTACULAR. .. this mexican  will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Bono had obviously not done a pre-concert taco run to Tacos Chiwas because we definitely found what we were looking for. Fueled by what @theflav said were \"maybe the best tacos I've had in America,\" we pounded this taco feast on a lightning fast overnight trip to PHX for U2's epic Joshua Tree tour. Just simply terrific tacos! Everything. That signature taco chiwas though...sooo good! Perfectly mesquite-grilled smoky carne asada, jalapeño and Anaheim chiles and queso. And that quesadilla and the \"Best in Phoenix\" award-winning frijoles charros?!?! Mercy! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Some of the best, most authentic street tacos that I have ever had! The corn tortillas are made fresh and the meat is all amazing. I highly suggest the al pastor taco and also the barbacoa. Definitely worth the wait in line. Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"We randomly found this place because we read a news article on it. I'm so glad we did! It's definitely a small, Mexican taco kind of place but that's what makes it so good! They have small menu with all good things. We tried the pollo, asada, pork and their chiwas tacos and they were all good. They are served street taco style. Our favorites were the chiwas and the steak. There's a mini salsa bar with a couple salsa options that were both too spicy for me but that's not saying much because I can't handle too much of the hot stuff! The only thing I could see being a problem is that they're making food as ordered so there may be a little wait but, in my opinion, that's what makes it good. Fresh food is always better. We will be going again."}
{"text":"Great service and awesome tacos. Everything I have tried is unique and tasty. That is all you need.  Support this place!"}
{"text":"When Taco is Life... But in order to be a review Yelp requires you to say more about something than is truly necessary.  Long reviews should be for anything less than 5 stars... The place is awesome, you go there for food... Not atmosphere, large parking lots or cocktails... Amazing tacos."}
{"text":"I tried the tacos chiwas that had the beef, ham and cheese with hatch green chili sauce and the classic Asada as well as the carnitas tacos. My favorite of course was the chiwas, it was so well balanced not too spicy and the ham was super subtle so it wasn't too salty. It was perfect! I give it a five star. The other tacos were good too but not like the chiwas. Yum."}
{"text":"This place was a nice quick stop on our road trip.. The people were nice and food amazing!! We arrived when they opened and by the time we left the place was packed.. Would recommend this to anyone.."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the food is always good. The cheese Gordita is a must, I've ordered it several times! I've also tried all the tacos and they're all delicious. They're on UberEATS, which is super convenient, and the food is just as amazing delivered."}
{"text":"Awesome hole in the wall place. We had the following tacos: asada, pollo, barbacoa, chiwas & pastor. All were legit & pollo had pickled onions on it. Quesadilla was super cheesy. Salsa & veggie bar had nice offerings. Salsa is spicy for those with sensitive palate's. Homemade tortillas at this place were delicious."}
{"text":"Discovered this little gem last night and is instantly my new favorite taco spot.  I will travel the distance as the tacos were worth it.  Handmade corn tortillas, perfectly seasoned meat that is tender, the flavors are amazing and the price more that reasonable.  Highly recommend!!! The menu is small but it's all you really need try the Gorditas!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I have ever had. Salsa is to die for as well. The tripas tacos are the best. They make the corn tortillas fresh, and they are delicious. So authentic, tastes like what my family would make. Also recommend al pastor and carne asada, even the lengua."}
{"text":"Ahh Mexican tacos... With so little options in town it's hard finding a place that can remind me of the savory meats and chiles my parents cooked up for me as a kid.    You are probably wondering if I live in a hole and the answer is of course not but I thought sarcasm would soften the stars rating I'm dropping here.  The truth is that although I am not a fan of bad ratings for new places I do have to share that the costs of each taco here at 2.50 per victim is a bit much for my Mexican pocket. Sorry if I offend most here but it's true. Sure this place can offer some good tacos but paying another buck for each taco is blasphemy when you have so many more options in town. Is this place busy? Yes which makes seating hard at times, it's hot too and parking is not always a guarantee.  Sorry to crash the party and be a downer but when taco joints across the city and even states are all cheaper they also can taste better regardless of the price too. You raise prices you need to sell me an experience and I regret I just felt like I visited another taco shop... That wants more of my money for less."}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco shops in the city. Owners are great people who are producing great authentic food that we all should be supporting.   I really can't choose an favorite. YOU CANT GO WORNG!"}
{"text":"They have the best gorditas, especially the red chile. I highly recommend the place to eat."}
{"text":"I have been on the hunt for good, authentic street tacos and central Mexican food since relocating to Arizona last year. The family and I were pleased to stumble on Tacos Chiwas! We ordered Asada, Al Pastor and Vegetarian Tacos as well as a Rajas Quesadilla. The corn tortillas here WIN WIN WIN! The asada is delicious and the Al Pastor, although not off the spit, is on point. The vegetarian taco that I had was squash, corn and cheese and very reminiscent of quesadilla filling from the little stands in 3 Marias Mexico. The rajas were traditionally prepared and the quesadilla was very fresh tasting (I know, strange for a heavy cheesy item to taste fresh, I think the tortilla had something to do with it).  The salsas were spicy and well flavored and the interior was cute and super clean, even the bathroom! Definitely a nice family run taco shop that I will be visiting again in the future!"}
{"text":"This place set the bar for me for tacos Al pastor. They were outstanding: moist, colorful, plentiful, tasty!  Oh and their green sauces are hot damn delicious!  My husband wasn't that impressed with the tacos de tripa and he's from Chihuahua so I guess that means something.  I wish they would do like in Mexico where you order at the front and then pay before you leave... Instead of having to get in line all over again for \"one more pinche taco\"  The line was ridiculous and not conducive to enjoying your meal when you keep having to go up and order more tacos (because who can only eat 4 and not want to try more?!? Right!?!? Ya feel me!?!?)"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from diners drive ins and dives. Since I was in the area I wanted to check it out.  Luckily when I got here there was no line I was able to order right away. Ordered 3 tacos asada, lengua, and tripa. My order came out quick and I made my way to the sauce bar. I prefer the spicy red over the spicy green.  All the tacos I had were delicious. After I was done I thought about ordering more but I didn't want to be a glutton.   If you're in the area I recommend you check it out and try different tacos."}
{"text":"A small place with a tiny menu, but this is part of the experience. The seasoning for all the meat dishes we tried was perfect. I tried it for the first time and fell in love with it."}
{"text":"I simply love the food at Tacos Chiwas. Best tacos I've had maybe ever, and the tortillas were perfect _and--despite the very generous filling--they held together to the last bite_. (The horchata needs some work, guys, but that's minor compared to how good the tacos were.)"}
{"text":"Food is great. Weekend customer service is great. Weekday customer service lacks. Asked the, newly trained, cashier to make my order to go.. she didn't. Girl who brought out my food (Annalise I believe) had an attitude, and rolled her eyes, when I told her it was a to go order. She took my order to the back and proceeded to unwrap my burrito WITH HER BARE HANDS and wrap it in a different paper. I called her over and asked the other cook to make new burritos. Health hazard waiting to happen. Loved coming here, as it was my daughter and my Saturday spot, but will never return. Very unfortunate."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, thought I'd finally write a review after today's visit.  Tacos are as everyone else says quite small even at $2.50 a pop not exactly a bargain.  The bean soup that won best of Phoenix isn't really very good me to.  I swear there was tripe in it. It sure wasn't bacon or salt pork, not impressed.  The tacos, salsa, jalapeno offerings are quite good.  Today I had a pollo, carne asada, and chiwas taco which is shredded beef, ham and cheese. The creamy green salsa is very good especially on the pollo taco.  I'll be back but will order differently next time, and certainly stear clear of the overhyped been soup."}
{"text":"Currently, this is my favorite place for tacos. These are not overly fancy tacos, they are just so fresh and full of flavor."}
{"text":"Very very delicious tacos. The gorditas are hand made. The quesadillas have such delicious flavor with the asadero cheese they use. Desebreda roja....superb! I highly recommend this place. We will be coming back soon! Very clean friendly service. Restroom nicely clean too"}
{"text":"We did a taste comparison between Tacos Chiwas and Al Fuego on Bell Rd by the SR51. At the end of the night eating amazing tacos side by side we concluded that if you go to either place you are the winner. Excellent mesquite flavor and texture with a beautiful tortilla perfectly cooked. A welcome addition to the Phoenix taco scene. That being said they have an amazing Verde Gordita that no one in town can touch."}
{"text":"These are actual authentic tacos and they are so delicious. Prices are great and inexpensive. There is not many places serving tacos on homemade tortillas!"}
{"text":"I love that someone gave this place 3 stars because of their lack of vegetarian options.  It's a taco shop, not Pita Jungle, take your ass to an all organic second hand fair trade book store with that shit.  Anyway, there isn't much that needs to be said that others haven't already said - this place is fantastic and does everything from scratch with fantastic ingredients.  The frijoles charros are ridiculous and I can imagine that when it gets cold I'll be stopping in for more and more of them.  The meats are all succulent and the salsas are great.  Sorry there isn't any soyrizo though."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!  I love the tacos and Barittos! This is a very clean and well maintained place to eat good food! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tried a selection of their taco offerings. The Tripas Tacos were GAF! They're like little folds of pork cracklin heaven. Recommend the Frijoles Charros. If they offered them in a gallon chug I could chug them all day.   I was hungry so I forgot to take a picture but they are simple enough I could've downed a few more."}
{"text":"The rajas gordita wasn't too bad but The pastor taco was on point I'd def go back for those!!! Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because it took forever to get my food."}
{"text":"Located in an unassuming old Dairy Queen building just off the freeway 51 and McDowell, this place is a total gem. I cant tell you how many times we have driven past this place with little consideration. Non the less we wanted some good Mexican food and ended up wanting to give it a try.  The staff here is incredibly nice and super polite. Every single person there, from the cashier to the cooks. We ordered the tacos linguas, tacos chiwas , quesadilla and the frijoles charros . ALL were fantastic but my ultimate favorite was the linguas taco. Holy goodness were they outstanding. We went back for seconds and if we hadn't been so full we would have gone for thirds. We are definitely going back and if you haven't gone yet and are debating, you should absolutely 100% go. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Im from namiquipa chihuahua and the food is spot on. Handmade tortillas, chiles from chihuahua and cheese from where i grew up. Hard to find an authentic restaurant but this little spot is amazing. Try the tripas and taco chihuas."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in PHX. The corn tortillas are hand made. I tried the carne asada, pastor, and the taco chihuas all were great 10/10!"}
{"text":"Tacos Chiwas is a hole in the wall on the south side of McDowell just east of San Carlos Bay Seafood.  It looks like a former Filibertos but don't let the bars on the windows fool you.  The food in here is delicious.  We ordered a raja gordita, crispy tripas taco, al pastor taco, chicken taco, beans, and an horchata.  The raja gordita was money.  Green chiles w/ cheese and beans stuffed in a small homemade tortilla.  The tripas was also excellent.  Cooked crispy and tasted great.  The pastor had a perfect marinade and was cooked right.  The chicken was boring but most chicken is.    The beans were the highlight of the meal.  Fresh pinto beans with chorizo and sausages cut up.  There was even a little tripe thrown in.  Absolutely on point.    The other highlight was the tortillas.  Fresh, hand made, exceptional tortillas.  The horchata was same as you'd get anywhere else.  They also had a salsa bar that was well stocked.  An avocado salsa, tomatillo, and arbol.  Along with that there were grilled serranos, limes, radish, and some other garnishes.  The only downfall was the price.  Now don't get me wrong, this place makes a damn good street taco but $2.50 is pricey for a 4 bite street taco no matter how good it is.  A grown man can easily eat 5 of these tacos without blinking an eye.  That said the place was really busy.  So if people are willing to pay it more power to them.    Maybe I should get in on this street taco craze..."}
{"text":"These are the best tacos I've had in my life. I am from Minnesota but don't let that throw you off too badly. If you know of better I'll drive an hour. Their special is particularly great."}
{"text":"The outside of this little hole does not look so great but don't let it fool you. So so so so freaking delicious! One of my favorite taco spots so far, super affordable. I am surprised they are not more expensive for the quality."}
{"text":"Really good, home style food. Loved the tacos de chicharon and tacos de calabacitas.  It's nice to sit outside when the weather is nice. Fast service and low prices will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Tacos are good, but a little bit steep on price for street size tacos. Two bites and the taco is finished! I ordered two tacos and a deshebrada and it was not enough food for me. Ordered three more tacos! Pastor and chicken were on point! Little self serve salsa bar to add some spice to your food! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I cringe trying to imagine the kind of \"Mexican food\" foodies in Arizona have been eating to give such inflated reviews. Yea this place is pretty good but not as good as you may expect if your visiting the place solely based on the yelp reviews. The place is pretty small so good luck getting a empty table to eat at.  The horchata was pretty darn good, its one of those items that has one name but many different ways it can taste, not all of them are good. I tried one of my girlfriends al pastor tacos and it was ok. The best one I had was the tripa taco, really good flavor. Also tried the chiwa taco and a barbacoa taco. Their salsas definitely helped mask the dryness of the al pastor and barbacoa and added a nice kick of heat into the tacos, I started to break a little sweat after the 4th taco. I also like that the toppings on the taco are determined by what meat you picked. And for anybody that's not familiar with Mexican meat and names there's a handy menu at the front desk that breaks down the names and what the taco will consist of. Will be back for more tripa tacos and to try the others I didn't get to."}
{"text":"Incredibly good.  Unique in a tasty way.  I will come back many times.  This will be a regular place for Mexican food for our family."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. I got the Chiwas Tacos: 1 for $2.50 and they are street tacos. I feel that the ppl who work there are really not welcoming. Especially the front counter girl who was working. It almost felt like we were unwanted guest in her home. Anyways, I went with my fiancé and we each got a few tacos, a drink each and shared a quesadilla - $44.00. We weren't at a sit doing restaurant, nor did we have any alcohol. Seemed pricey for what we actually got. I didn't hate the place, but there are too many other great places for good Mexican food, like Los Dos Molinos, where you actually get value with your experience."}
{"text":"THE best tacos I've ever had in my life. I wish this place wasn't so far from home. There was so much flavor in the meats, the staff was very patient as we ordered almost one of everything. We wanted to try it all! When j travel to Phoenix again I will most definitely stop in again. The restaurant has been featured food network. The inside can probably use some more seating because with Food so good I'm positive it must get super crowded."}
{"text":"Rumor has it that this used to be a BBQ place in the recent past and I believe they still might be using the smoker in the back to add some delicious hints of smoke to their yummy meats. Nice!  Came here during the Christmas holidays with my wife and liked it so much that I came back the next day. The menu is very simple with just the right amount of items. Sometimes that is the best way to keep things really fresh and tasty without going overboard. They even make homemade Tortillas for their Tacos and Gorditas which are really outstanding.  Ordered mainly Tacos on the first visit and was not disappointed. My wife tried the Carne Asada and a Carnitas Taco and a side of their yummy Bean Soup. Yours truly went with a Beef Tongue, an al Pastor, the famous Chiwas Taco, and a side of Bean Soup. It was so good that we ordered a few more tacos including the special of the day which happened to be Goat and BBQ Beef Cheek.   Everything was amazing and presented in a very old school way on some plastic plates. The textures and flavors of the meats were spectacular and just melted in our mouths. They also have a very nice Salsa bar with some really cool choices to enhance your dishes.  The next day ... ordered another one of their famous Tacos Chiwas, a Rajas stuffed Gordita and a Shredded Red Chili Beef Burrito and was truly satisfied with those items as well. Tried really hard not to overeat like the day before to some success.  Service is friendly and rather quick. You basically order at the counter and they bring it to your table. Perfect amount of time to grab a bunch of goodies off the salsa bar and do a little munching before the food arrives.  This is one of those buried treasures and from the sign outside you can see the remains of an old Dairy Queen that stood here years ago. The parking lot is small but you can also park on the other side along the fence.  This is definitely my new favorite Taco Places at the moment and it even made some noise in the local PHX Magazine a while back. Hurry in and get yourself something wonderful. Try not and eat too much or you might need a delightful cat nap afterwards. QUE FANTASTICO!  4.75 STARS"}
{"text":"We tried the lengua, tripas and Calabasitas tacos. Delicioso!!!! The tripas were crispy and not greasy. The Calabasitas were very flavorful and the lengua was prefect. We will definitely go back. I usually eat chicken but decided to deviate from the norm and I was glad I did."}
{"text":"Price 7/10 Food 6/10  Saw great reviews for this place and was looking forward to the food. A bit disappointed. Got the Asada burrito and a horchata, came out to be $10 with tip. Meat was dry, tortilla tastes store-bought. Horchata was ok. Maybe I caught them on a bad day or ordered the wrong thing, but I'm quite disappointed"}
{"text":"Pretty cool little hole in the wall place.  Street tacos were very good.  Taco were a bit small which is the only reason for 4 stars."}
{"text":"I am eating at taco Chiwas right now.  These are the best pork tacos I have ever had.  I'm moving in down the street, so this place will be on my rotating BEsT of the best food places.  Yahoo!"}
{"text":"Went there several months ago and haven't returned. I ordered a bean burrito and husband ordered a taco (don't remember exact one). The burrito was pitiful, if they are able to make money on that then I should go into business! The beans were ok but the tortilla was from a package. The taco was better but not worth going back. The only thing for us that was good was the service."}
{"text":"They could possibly be the Best street Tacos ever  Tasty I ordered a Carne Asada, Carnites,AL Pastore and Chiwa Great then I got a Raja gordita and shredded Burito Great I Will be back soon ."}
{"text":"Omg the tacos are not that great for the price , and the portions are even worse. Not worth it for tacos and not willing to getting ripped off"}
{"text":"Last night I got incredibly hungry. After a quick scan of the local offerings open around 8:30 pm, I narrowed my search to \"tacos\" and hit return. I then erased that search and typed in \"bars\" but quickly changed my mind back to tacos...  Now, I'm pretty well versed in what a great taco should be. I've traveled quite a bit in my day. (At 33 I feel I'm qualified to now say that, and always wanted to position it well in a sentence)   The Phoenix area, of which I am native to, has some of the best. I'm not saying it is the best. But it is definitely in the conversation.   Until last night, the best tacos I have ever eaten were from a street side cart while returning back to the US from Tijuana Mx. I think I paid ¢50 for two.   Enough background. Let's get to the nitty gritty.   I first noticed the gentleman manning the cook top flipping what appeared to be hand made corn tortillas. Always a good sign that you're in for a great experience. The second observation I made was the condiment stand in the corner, appetite whet. Finally, a tale tale sign of a great restaurant is a minimal, focused menu. Check and check.   It is my opinion that carne asada tacos are not the best option. Sure I like them. Sure they are good. However when it comes to flavor, lengua and cabeza are my personal favorites.   That being said, I ordered \"queiro un taco de asada, uno de pastor, y una de lengua o y para tomar coca en botella\"   I order this to go. But during my wait I saw a guy wearing a sombrero with a flowing ponytail looking like he was in 7th heaven while eating his order. A life decision was made here.   Bag in hand I hit the condiment section. Loaded up on jalapeños torreados salsa verde and guacamole salsa. Sat out front in the patio and began to enjoy.   Carne asada :)) Pastor :))) Lengua :))))))))))))  If you've come this far. Just go. Seriously. Five stars. My only regret is there aren't more stars to give."}
{"text":"They lack space to sit and eat. But, besides that inconvenience, the tacos I ate were good, not extraordinary, but I'm willing to go one more time and give it a try on something else on the menu. Or just maybe some other meat on my tacos to really evaluate their tacos.  Plus, they have mexican Coke, which always goes well with tacos.  I really appreciate them not advertising themselves as \"authentic mexican food\". Thanks!!!!"}
{"text":"Good cheap authentic mexican. Their flour tortillas are strangely addicting. Chewy, and obviously fresh. And their light green salsa is light & spicy. I usually go for carnitas, and they were good, but I surprisingly liked the cheese quesadillas the best. Cheap, good, and satisfying."}
{"text":"Yelp circle jerk alert! Completely average tacos. Homemade authentic style, mom and pop, tacos. Not terrible, and not memorable. Regular average flavors. Edible and definitely tacos. Nothing wrong with that, just not worthy of pulling your pants down to your knees and helicoptering your D up and down the street. Give me a break hipsters. Get over yourselves.  Don't get the tacos here. Just get the gorditas."}
{"text":"Like many others, came here for the tacos. Kind of bland, to be honest. The horchata kind of watered down as well. Spent $12 for a $6 meal. Staff was nice, though."}
{"text":"Tacos Chiwas is housed in a former Dairy Queen. Parking can be a challenge since this place is quite popular.  The atmosphere is very basic- walk up counter and limited seating. Service was fine and the dining area was clean, but became very smokey towards the end of our meal.  Who doesn't like smelling like carne Asada on taco Tuesday though?  They have a simple menu- tacos, burritos, gorditas, quesadilla, and breakfast burritos.  The food is affordable ($2.50/taco) and delicious.  I had the beef Barbacoa and calabacitas tacos both of which are not on the normal menu.  Both tacos were delicious!  The barbacoa was tender and juicy and the calabacitas (squash with cheese) were on point.  I liked the red salsa the best which was spicy and flavorful.  The green salsa was also good. It's a self serve salsa bar which I typically don't like because they are usually messy and make me wonder how people can be so disgusting, but this one was very clean.   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Found a new Taco joint!!!  Trust when I say it's a must try! Authentic Mexican street tacos bursting with flavor. I brought a couple co-workers to help try the full menu of meats. We all had tacos and tried: Carne Asada , Al Pastor , Tripa , Chicken, Lengua, and Carnitas. All super good. To be honest beats the place down the street with the big reviews. This is a lucky find and glad I tried it out.   We arrived during lunch time mins before Noon and after I placed my order the line was crowding the entrance. Small little restaurant, food came out quick, staff was friendly.   Topped it off with a little cone filled with Cajeta!!"}
{"text":"We have no shortage of good taquerias in the city, and for each one there will usually be one kind of taco that will stand out. While it is relatively easy to make good carne asda, pollo, or pastor tacos, tripa is somewhat tricky in my experience - it has to be done really right or it will have a somewhat funky flavor. Tacos chiwas makes tacos de tripa really, really well: the tripa is crispy and oh-so tasty. It is the main reason I come to this place. All their other tacos are good, but the tripa is ambrosia for me. The salsa/fixins bar is small but sufficient and I like that they offer sauteed onions, my favorite topping. I love their horchata - refreshing, almondy, and not too sweet. For the quality of the food, the prices are good. Some time in the future I'll try their beans that everyone has been raving about, but in the meantime I'll be returning because I'm drawn by the siren song of their tacos de tripa."}
{"text":"Great tocos and gorditas! burritos are not what I expected Meat had a great fire taste,  The salsas are very good too"}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend and family and this place doesn't disappoint, hand made tortillas are the best and their selection of meat is so good, I love this place"}
{"text":"Another quality lunch from Tacos Chiwas!  Chicken, steak, beans, whatever you choose, your taste buds will thank you! My favorite item is the Frijoles Charros!"}
{"text":"Second trip to Chiwas and second review. This time I ordered the Tacos Chiwas and chicken gordita. The tacos were certainly worth writing about, but for times sake I want to tell you about the chicken gordita - SO GOOD!! This was my first experience having a gordita, and if this is any indication of what to expect, I don't think I'll ever eat anything else! In two visits my favorites are the al pastor tacos and chicken gordita. On your next trip make sure you get at least one!"}
{"text":"Absolutely a five star rating for this place. Yes this is a little hole in the wall restaurant but don't let that fool you. I was impressed with everything on my very first visit. First of all I ordered two tacos which were exceptionally good. The condiment bar was covered and kept very clean. Service was fast and friendly. I will certainly come back here again my next time passing by. Muchos gracias!!!!!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the good. Tortillas are great and not oily, al pastor is marinated really good and has excellent flavor. Salsas are really great with lots of flavor. Things that I would change, first is the prices. Each taco is 2.50 as much as a medium drink. A little too high compared to other taco places but I guess I understand since they have plenty Caucasian clientele. Asada meat doesn't have much flavor, it almost tastes as if it was boiled first then cooked. The pickled onions didn't really compliment the asada meat and gave it an odd taste."}
{"text":"I thought my burrito at taco chiwas was good, not great. The burrito was not very big and size and I was ready to fuel the beast. The burritos are pretty basic and there is not much that they put in the burrito. I ordered a beef burrito which was very flavorful. Next time I am here I am probably going to go for the tacos. Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"So, i've heard SO much about this place and of course have come across their amazing Yelp reviews so on Saturday night, we decided to give it a try! It definitely did not disappoint! It is a hole-in-the-wall, super casual, and very authentic. I LOVE their salsa bar that also had fresh radishes, cucumbers, roasted peppers, and more. BEWARE: The peppers are pretty spicy! But thanks to their refreshing bottled grapefruit soda, the numbness went away in no time.   I ordered 3 tacos - pollo, carne asada, and carnitas. All were delicious and I would absolutely get them again! My favorite was the carne asada, the marinade on the meat was so tasty! Also, my fiance ordered a rajas gordita (vegetarian) and it was so fantastic. This is an absolute must. It is a tortilla pocket filled with cheese, roasted jalapenos, and hatch chiles. Lastly, I ordered their 'bean soup' which is pinto beans with a few different meats and a fantastic broth.   I recommend eating at the restaurant to get an authentic experience and of course, take full advantage of their fresh salsa bar. They even had a cute, young mariachi band playing in the background. We'll absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"I heard good things about tacos chiwas, being on the Food Network and all. When I arrived the lady taking my order had an attitude the trash was overfilling and they told me there was no guacamole left in the salsa bar. I sat down and received my tacos and my \"famous bean soup\". The tacos weren't bad and the soup is pretty good however I was surrounded by fruit flies everywhere while trying to enjoy my meal. I don't want to imagine what the kitchen looked like."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos in town.  The owner came and talked with us for a while - good guy.  The only critique is the size of the plates - they are too small and can be messy"}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place based on all the good reviews and hype but was disappointed in the end. Tried the carne asada and al pastor tacos: the meat was a little bland and the tacos were a little small compared to others."}
{"text":"i order here are ton via uber eats and this place is really hit or miss.  i dont know if it's the time of day, day of the week, or what but sometimes you get tacos that clearly taste like reheated leftovers and other times you get much better fresh tasting tacos.  it just varies a ton.   when they're on point, they're really good.  the al pastor and pollo tacos are what they are good at in my opinion.  the carne asada is almost always dry/overcooked and the taco chiwas while a great taco flavor wise, is ruined by the same almost always overcooked carne asada.    they also mark up the prices on uber eats which is lame.  that said, it's still my go to taco shop on uber eats compared to the others in my delivery zone until something better comes along.   but if i'm gonna make my way down there i much rather go to la santisima or tacos huicho in terms of consistent quality tacos."}
{"text":"The food is so good. I had a al pastor taco and a carne asada burrito both were delicious. The salsa bar is a bonus you have a selection of sauces to smother your food in.   The tortillas were fresh and the food is made to order. If you like tacos and burritos you should come eat here.  I was gonna snap some photos of my food but I ate it to quickly so  Next time."}
{"text":"Not to bad. I must come back with my other half. I came for carne asada tacos and ended up liking the carnitas and chicken taco. I'll be back, let's see what the wife this thinks."}
{"text":"So delicious! We stopped by after seeing positive reviews on Yelp, and were quite happy with everything we had - but the tacos al pastor were my favorite. Everything seemed super fresh, the server was very friendly, and the salsa bar had a variety of delicious options plus fresh cucumber. Would definitely go back if we lived in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Absolute place to try if ur in the area!  Little hole in the wall serving delicious authentic Mexican food with very reasonable prices.  Cow tongue burrito is my favorite.  Strongly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I first encountered the staff of Tacos Chiwas not long ago at the Devour Culinary Festival.  At that event, Tacos Chiwas and Bitter & Twisted Cocktail Parlor teamed up to make what was effectively a Mexican Sushi dish.  Basically seasoned ground beef and chimichurri rolled up and served with soy sauce.  It was a surprisingly delicious hybrid and was a big hit at the festival.  While I had no illusions about finding such a dish at Tacos Chiwas' flagship operation, I was nevertheless interested in taking a crack at their menu.  Then a crack of a different kind, the crack of shattered windows and broken registers that only jerks make.  Some world class jackasses made off with thousands of dollars during a late night robbery of Chiwas' main location.  No one was hurt, but the damage and lost cash was a nasty blow to owners Armando Hernandez and Nadia Holguin.  Upon hearing the news of the robbery from the Phoenix New Times, I decided Monday after work was as good a time as any to make my first visit and help out by enjoying a good meal here.  Located in an old drive thru restaurant on McDowell Road just west of the 51 freeway, Chiwas converted this old building into a brick and mortar taco stand.  The setup is simple and no frills with picnic table seating outside, while inside is a mix of regular tables and chairs as well as some booth seating.  Altogether I'd guess the place can fit about 50-60 at a time.  Brown walls, brown seating, brown tile, you get the idea.  Order up front and they bring out the good stuff to your table.  The menu includes much of what you'd expect to find at any taco stand with taco offerings including carne asada (beef), pastor (pork), and pollo (chicken).  Burrito offerings are also in abundance with various breakfast and lunch burrito options.  Being a first timer, I decided to go with a mix of items both familiar and unfamiliar.  First item was the Taco Chiwas, the restaurant's own housemade creation.  Beef, ham, cheese, jalapeño, and hatch chiles.  Second, a Picadillo Gordita.  Ground beef, carrots, and potatoes in what essentially looks like an open faced papusa.  Third, a cup of their Frijoles Charros.  A traditional Mexican bean soup with beans, ham, veggies, as well as some onion, garlic and bacon.  Lastly, Horchata.  Because...well...no Mexican meal is complete without a tall glass of Horchata (at least in my opinion).  Total cost for all of this including tax?  Just $11.  I gotta say the Picadillo Gordita really stood out for me.  It hit a surprisingly savory note for me.  I think it was the spices they used plus the texture of the bread.  The Taco Chiwas was also quite good, and not nearly as spicy as I'd expected.  Certainly had some heat, but not overpowering.  The soup came to my table plenty hot, but not at all spicy.  A good hearty mix of meats and beans in a tasty broth.  Honestly the Horchata was probably the only real disappointment for me as it was a little flat without much in the way of that cinnamon note I always love.  All in all though, a good meal and a good value.  Chiwas is an ideal spot for a late breakfast or lunch.  The food is cheap and the service is quick for those on the go.  I have no idea what prompted those robbers to target this place, but based on the turnout I saw today, Chiwas isn't going anywhere.  Local owners serving good food at a price point accessible to pretty much anyone.  I'll be back and I'll be excited to see what Armando and Nadia come up with at next year's Devour."}
{"text":"Great Tacos! We are self proclaimed street taco snobs, so when we say we love it here, please know we are comparing all the taco shops across the west coast. We ordered the Chiwas tacos and they were  very good! They are different with the ham, but the cheese and chilles made it really good. We also tried the Carne Asada and it was very good. Carne Asada to me comes a dime a dozen and it can be boiled or have a ton of fat and this wasn't the case. The meat was grilled and they must use their own marinade because it was tender and had really good flavor. Usually I put a ton of lime and these didn't need it. We also ordered a Carne Asada quesadilla and it was very good. It wasn't too big and they use a good white cheese: it was a little greasy, but not too bad and I will order it again. The salsa bar is pretty good. The red sauce is really spicy! I'm still looking for that really good red sauce at these Taco shops and haven't found it yet, but in all it was good here. The green salsa was very good and they had two types of Guacamole salsa. One was pretty normal and good, the other was really different. It was spicy and had a sour taste. I'll have to try it again to see if I like it or not. So, this was probably my favorite taco spot in AZ so far and I highly recommend it. It's kinda small so go at a time when it may not be busy. Also, the inside was very nice and clean."}
{"text":"Excellent food, the tacos China's are by far the best but the carne Assad and pork tacos were also excellent. Great salsa, friendly staff and most important the bean and cheese burrito test. My theory on the basis of a Mexican restaurant's quality is all in the bean and cheese burrito. Anyone can put a bunch of ingredients into a burrito to make it flashy and interesting but if they can make the most simple burrito right you know everything else will be good. I'll give their bean and cheese an 8.5. The burrito was a little small but the tortilla and beans were fabulous. Overall I definitely recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"This is officially one of my favorite Mexican food shops. I am very picky about my red chile beef because no one makes it like my mother except Tacos Chiwas. I ordered the deshebrada roja gordita and the red chile was delicious and flavorful and it had potatoes!! Just like my mother makes hers. Love, love, loved it!! My other favorite gordita is the bean and cheese. Beans are perfectly refried with the perfect amount of cheese. This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"I drive by here everyday from work and finally made an opportunity to stop in after reading about it in an article from AZ Republic's Dominic Armato awhile back. If you know anything about McDowell Rd, it has great Mexican food up and down its long stretch of road. This place is a nice welcome addition to some of Arizona's great food from across the border. It was started by a couple from Chihuahua, Mexico who wanted to bring their flavors from home to the Valley. The outside doesn't look like much, but don't let that fool you. This place serves up some top-notch street tacos. Food is ordered at the counter and you have a choice to dine inside or on their patio. They have a nice variety of slow simmering meats to choose from (including lengua (beef tongue) and tripe) that are packed into fresh corn tortillas. I went for the asada, pastor and the signature taco chiwas (a combination of beef, ham, cheese, Hatch chiles and jalapeños). I seriously felt like I was chilling on some beach in Mexico putting down some buck street tacos. The meat is so tender and juicy. They have a nice condiment bar that you can get sides of salsa, guac, radishes and chilis to add to your meal. One thing I love about this place is the prices are very reasonable. Some of these new Americanized joints way overcharge for their tacos. You can get a full meal for under $10 here. I highly recommend getting their bean soup on the side - super good! Also on their menu are burritos, flour gorditas and breakfast (served 10am - noon)."}
{"text":"Very nice and clean interior. Ordered  barbacoa, carne asada & lengua tacos..asada was the best one. The salsa bar was a plus, free guac!! Many meat options. $2.50 each taco is not what im used to at all sadly. The asada is really good but not worth 2.50ea good. I can see myself returning if im close by the area..but I still want to explore more taco places"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and amazing food! This place is worth going to even if it's a few minutes or miles extra of a drive. I like it here because of the great customer service experience. These waiters actually have a little gittie up to there step! The food is splendid and so is the Rasta Gordida . This is a super clean and well maintained establishment. Highly recommended for people who love good food at an affordable price."}
{"text":"The Frijoles Charros here have opened my eyes to the delicious and creamy world of beans. Put that can of Busch's corn syrup crap down and get in here. Bits of hot dog, and chicharron give the beans new layers of texture and flavor. It was complex and comforting, like a hug from your entire extended family. It is a dish that is worth traveling here to try.  The Gorditas were another standout dish. Light and fluffy, with a crisp outer shell.   I wasn't as blown away by the tacos as everyone else is. It might have just been a little over hyped for me. They are delicious tacos, in firm but pillowy homemade tortillas. They didn't change my life like the Frijoles, but if I was local I'd be back for more again and again. I will say the Tacos Chiwas needs more cheese and then it needs to be melted! If my taco has cheese I want it to be ooey gooey!"}
{"text":"We stopped in yesterday for lunch after hearing rave reviews about this place...and we were not disappointed.  We tried 4 different types of tacos and this is our order of preference: pastor, carnitas, pollo and carne asada.  They were all good, but the asada needed more flavor to rank higher in our minds. I also enjoyed a refreshing hibiscus agua fresca...great lunch for sure!"}
{"text":"Long wait, order was passed on behind three others, which is odd, b/c it was for three tacos and a quesadilla. Guy handing out orders didn't apologize or explain the wait time. Quality of food was decent but not worth the $15. There's too many other options in that area that offer better deals."}
{"text":"Went last night with friends and we loved it. The tacos of Tripas and gorditas were like back home goodness. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Some of the best lengua tacos I have ever had. Greatly recommend for some well-priced delicious tacos and with a side order of rajas gorditas just knocked it out of the park. And the cherry-on-top is the horcata."}
{"text":"Basically my new favorite taco place! I tried 5 different tacos and not one disappointed. This place is new, and I have no worries that they will stay in business...just based off the fact that they are a solid taco hot spot! P.s- not much sitting space...but I would stand for these tacos!"}
{"text":"Listen up, Howard & Myrna! This place is amazing! This used to be a Dairy Queen. Places looks a bit run down but go in and order and you'll be amazed. Their Tacos, Burritos and Gorditas are incredible. Great service and the people that run and work the counter are down to earth good people.   Ro and I often enjoy Tapas at various places in one evening for variety and this place is always on our list. Give this new business a try -- you won't be disappointed. Cheers***"}
{"text":"My friends & manager have mentioned this place a hand full of times. The barbacoa tacos & frijoles charros are amazing!  Food quality & flavors are perfect."}
{"text":"Food taste okay. Nothing extra special. Especially for the prices, $2.50 for a micro tacos with a little meat and no toppings or stupid me with getting calabacitas (honestly one slice of a zucchini and 4 kernels of corn). Its not worth $2.50 at all (4 inch total length of the corn tortilla. And its only one tortilla). My bacon egg breakfast burrito was on a 10 inch store bought tortilla and for $5.00 was definitely not worth it, i should have gone to Fillibertos for at least 15 inch tortilla with lots of egg filling. I'm going to Tacos Mich for the $.75 tacos on Wednesday at 16th st and McDowell or any night at 18th st and McDowell (corner market) for $1.00 tacos in the evening and they are great with a lot of meat. Sorry but you need to step and give better portions, your flavor won't keep you in business, its not that good."}
{"text":"This place was okay. As a foodie who travels a lot I don't understand the hype. Not bad food but I wouldn't go out of my way. The meat lacked flavor. The prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Was hungry and looked for something on yelp that was well rated and near by.  This was the perfect place to get a quick bite to eat.  Very easy to find on the south side of McDowell.  My son and I tried the asada taco and it was delicious.  Packed full of medium cooked chunks of steak.  We also shared two gorditas.  One with beans, ground beef and potatoes.  I loved the filling but wasn't a huge fan of the breading.  Also tried the red chili with potato one.  This was a little spicy but good.  Would stick to tacos or something else next time.  Really wanted to try the bean soup but they were sold out.  The salsa bar was good but out of cucumbers and really low on radishes.  I adored the green avocado salsa.  Service was friendly and big bottles of water for $1 a huge plus in the hot summer months.   Would not hesitate to stop in again for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Tortillas! Las tortillas are delicious!! What the heck are they putting in them? Love it, whatever it is. Carne azada tacos-good! Tacos Chiwas-amazing!"}
{"text":"I tried 3 tacos: Lengua (tender without being slimy) Asada (charred on the outside, a touch of pink in the middle) and Chiwas (beef, bacon, cheese, delicious). The Bean Soup is also great and chock full of chunks of ham.   The interior is tasteful and clean, the staff friendly and sincere. Overall a great addition to the McDowell taco scene!"}
{"text":"Homemade tortillas, tender & mouth watering meat, friendly service, clean facilities are what make this a perfect place. It's right on the way to the airport to we stopped on our way out of town. The flavor was also incredible and you can tell that this place is authentic!"}
{"text":"What an amazing lunch! Had a burrito and then sampled a pile of tacos. The problem is...that was a damn expensive lunch and I needed all those tacos to make up for the size of the burrito and tacos. Small portions, at big portion prices.  The good news...they were AMAZING! But again, the price was high for small servings in my opinion. I also wandered next door and had the chocolate flan...um, YUM!   So, save your lunch money for a few days and invest it here! Unfortunately it won't be a habit because of the cost."}
{"text":"Unusually good tacos as well as novel. Desserts extraordinary. Ignore the location, well worth the visit."}
{"text":"I always passed by this place and didnt even pay attention to it.  They definitely have some good tacos"}
{"text":"No no no, this is just as gourmet taco place with a clientele of guys who loves to post their tacos on social media taking pictures from different angles and using filters before to post them ahhh what can i say if it's fine for them to get a expensive cute mini taco for their instagram good...but I'm still hungry after 4 of those mini expensive tacos, not coming back..."}
{"text":"They have some of the best street tacos I've had. Great little Taco joint, I really enjoyed this place, it has excellent food and good service. Great place for lunch! They made me love him."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Been twice in a row and each time is as good as the last. The Red Chile gorditas are so good, and are more filling than you'd expect. The Red Chile Burro is awesome as well. Hooked!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a quick spot for food after traveling from the airport and this was perfect! The woman and man who worked there were so sweet and made conversation with us and genuinely hoped we liked the food - we definitely did! Quick, friendly and delicious. All of it tasted crazy authentic. They are pending a liquor license in June so once that happens it'll be even better ;)"}
{"text":"Not the best burritos or tacos in town. The type of tortilla they used made the burrito tasteless. I wouldnt order from here again, overpriced for the small things you get!"}
{"text":"Chiwas! Chiwas! I found the best place on earth for tacos! Great place, family owned where they provide quality and excellent service. All the tacos are amazing and made to order for you. Tortillas are made fresh. Let me not forget the salsas, they help enhance every single bite!   On the routine taco order:  Asada Taco Pollo Taco Pastor Taco Cheese quesadilla   I know I need to expand my palette, but it's just so darn good every time! I will return (sooner rather than later) and might have a new addiction! Try it out!"}
{"text":"Tacos where to small for the price $2.50 ea. The meat wasn't that great only good think was the carner asada I got a quesadilla too and it was really small for $5.00"}
{"text":"If I lived in Phoenix, this place would have all of money.  All. Of. It.   Thanks Yelp, for directing me to this little gem of amazing goodness.   I sent my friend a picture of my lunch...and she texted back, \"Are you in Mexico again?\"...because that's how amazing this place is.  So my chubby friend and I cyber stalked Tacos Chiwas from afar, and as soon as our plane landed, we jumped in our rented clown car and literally raced to try it out. OMG. It did not disappoint.  Like at all.  As a matter of fact, half of the time we were in Sedona, we were plotting our departure time to ensure that we would have time to pick up another snack before getting on the plane.  Ahem. On to the food. I had tacos de tripa, lengua, calabacitas, barbacoa and one al pastor.  All heavenly, but the lengua was my favorite!   So so so tender and flavorful. My friend loved his crispy tripas.  They're all amazing. Because I'm a pig, I also tried a rajas gordita.  Bad idea. If you want to continue fitting in your clothes, remain on a diet or avoid obesity, don't start eating these because it was literally heavenly and so so so delicious. Horchata was on point too.  Salsa? So hot I was crying. Just the way I love it; hot yet still with flavor. Are you understanding how much I loved this place?  My friend and I nearly missed our flight because not coming back here was NOT an option. And yes, I straight up inhaled my tacos and gorditas right in the airport, like a shameless pig. Because it's good stuff y'all. Go there. And go hungry. Tacos Chiwas...I'm a forever fan!"}
{"text":"Tacos are small with not much meat. I had 3 tacos and was still hungry. The tripe is deep fried and well-salted. The lengua was a bit watery. Not very impressed."}
{"text":"The food is so ridiculously good for the price you pay! I'm definitely visiting again soon :)"}
{"text":"Aftter seeing all the great reviews and write ups from the food blogger community I was super excited to try this place out.  I I make a pretty mean Taco at home and believe I have a pretty good palate for carne asada and Al Pastor.  While they make a good attempt at homemade tortillas I tried the carne asada, carnitas and pastor. All were very dry and lacking flavor definitely needed more seasoning and or juiciness."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for lunch with my husband, per the recommendation of a friend. We had the asada tacos, refried beans and horchata. All in all it was delicious, and our food was ready quickly because we went during what Google described as their slowest time of the day. Easily some of the best street tacos I've had in a while... However, I found this place to be pretty overpriced. We spent $30 on 6 street tacos, beans and horchata, where as you can get similar quality tacos and horchata from Los Taquitos for much less. That's my only complaint besides the fact that this restaurant does not serve rice. I'd eat at Tacos Chiwas again, but might pre-game with an appetizer elsewhere."}
{"text":"Tacos Chiwas.... where have you been all of my life? We needed a quick place to eat before taking me to the airport. I was reluctant to go but the boyfriend has been good all week so I gave in to his cravings. It's definitely a hole in the wall place but I'm glad we stopped by.  I ordered the lengua and carnitas tacos. They were both garnished with chopped cilantro and onions. Both were delish but I preferred the lengua over the carnitas... flavor and texture wise. I checked out their salsa bar and got some of the sauteed onions and the roasted habaneros. The sauteed onions - a must try. The roasted habaneros added a nice spiciness to the tacos - but take small bites. You'll thank me later.  We shared a large horchata - I really enjoyed it! It's properly spiced and not overly sweet like most places.  They serve menudo on the weekends - I love a good menudo! I will definitely come back to try that.   Price - 2 tacos, a asado burrito and a large horchata came to about $15.XX including tax. Not too shabby.   Service - quick and friendly  Atmosphere - random decor like it was decorated by a person with ADHD. Look squirrel..."}
{"text":"Literally just left Tacos Chiwas and needed to write a review.   COME HERE!!   All the tacos were so savory and made to order! Definitely order at least one taco chiwa. You'll want five more after it, trust me. The beans that they serve are amazing! You'll want more of those too. Salsa bar was my favorite part. I want one of those things in my house.   Customer service was great. They checked on us twice and asked if we enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"it was really good not gonna lie but why are you guys so damn pricey? I can tell your trying to profit a little to hard."}
{"text":"Best tacos I have ever had in Arizona and I have lived here for over 10 years. It is slow because it is quality ingredients and made with love. The chef's and front counter people are super friendly and it's worth the wait. Had the Gorditas and Tacos and I will return whenever I want the best tacos in Arizona."}
{"text":"I come here every Friday if I can. I have had the gorditas, the burritos and each kind of taco. Each time I bring a new friend and Chiwas earns a new customer.   The tortillas they hand make are splendid The carne asada is tender The pollo is delectable The pastor is amazing The gorditas remind me of my moms food  Just eat here and be happy"}
{"text":"Tonight was national taco night. Taco chiwas had great seasoned carne asada tacos. The people where friendly, there just was not a lot of room to sit and the whole restraint was smokey because they were cooking so much meat but overall these tacos where good and I would recommend."}
{"text":"If you're a \"conservative\" Mexican please don't come, if you really want to try a good quality taco, you have to come right now.  The prices are kind of the high side but for a good reason, homemade tortillas, high quality meat and BEER!!"}
{"text":"This place has really delicious tacos. It is a small store, cheap, quick and friendly. Every time I'm in the area I have to stop here to eat."}
{"text":"Totally different than other Mexican food I've had, but this was some of the best I've ever had.   Can't wait to keep going back."}
{"text":"Vegetarian = only 2 options cheese quesadilla & Rajas something on the right side of the menu with no meat. The food inside came in a pita looking taco. The tortilla was good, but the inside was alright. The lady didn't understand what I was saying about adding veggies to a taco. *queso is white not yellow, but not melted shredded only* Also NO CHIPS here!    My meat eating family= stated it was very good, and there was no fat on the meat in the tacos.   The taco bar is small; as well as the seating in the restaurant. All the salsas are hottt no different flavor than the \"color\" of them.   I wouldn't recommend this for vegetarians, but for meat eaters yes! Only reason we tried this is because on FB it stated the \"best taco\" place in Arizona."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim today and WOW what a great find!  The Chiwas Tacos with Hatch Chile are some of the best soft tacos I've ever had, and I've had many.  Definitely going back for more tomorrow."}
{"text":"Sister & I found Chiwas by chance on DDD, wow, sooo good! Quick street Tacos,best so far, I had 3 tacos & a gordita pastor, Joyce had bean n' chez burrito, chick taco & beef taco, choose your sauces; old school, beans w/lard,small joint big on GOODNESS. Good parking, indoor/outdoor eatery. Friendly, knowledgeable  service. Choose you pleasure,get a number,get a table and dive-in for the best in town!! We're going back...SOON:):)"}
{"text":"This place has awesome tacos! Everything scratch made from what I can see. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Okay so as far as authentic goes, this place is it.   Simple but oh so tasty. I had the chiwas and the barbacoa tacos. My boyfriend had carne asada and barbacoa. The flavours on the tacos were for the most part excellent. The chiwas taco was a bit too fatty for me, so I didn't love it. I think the way to go here is to get a simple taco and add salsa and fixings after. Definitely a hidden gem! So glad I tried this place, I'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Ever done hard time?  This (former Dairy Queen?) has so many bars on the windows you may feel like you're in (or have a flashback to when you were in) the mess hall at San Quentin (Sheriff Joe Would stick you in a tent city).  Actually - the interior is very clean, the tables and chairs are new, the service provided is very nice - plus (bonus) after lunch you are not limited to 30 minutes of rec time per day in the yard.  The food is damn good.  Small portions for small prices.  Order at the counter and then take a seat in the dining area.  We tried the picadillo and rajas gorditas as well as the standard beef and chicken tacos.  Authentic.  Tasty.  But not mind-blowing...  The condiment bar es muy bueno.  The chunky salsa verde is the shining star, and their runny guacamole sauce is similar to that at El Guero Canelo.  But I thought the red sauce tasted too much of the same flavor as a can of El Pato sauce, and they slice the fresh radishes waaay too thin (like thinner than potato chip thin).  And what's up with served ice cold charred serranos?  If you want 5 stars from me those roasted peppers should be roasted daily and served warm!  This is a fine 4 star addition to the local area and, like most parolees from the big house, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Located in an area that is not the most \"upscale\" and the exterior is nothing that would be considered \"eye catching\". Yet, once you try the food, you're hooked. I especially loved the gorditas and only $3 each, I could have had 10 they were so good. Everything is excellent but I think the shredded beef in green chile stands out, melts in your mouth literally. Met the owner, very appreciative and knows what he's doing. Best in town!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed. Everyone and their mommas were talking about this place. It's overpriced for an alright one tortilla taco. Salsas are no good. I give it two stars because las tortillas están hechas a mano."}
{"text":"Phoenix is full of great spots to grab a taco, but Tacos Chiwas is a favorite of mine. The carne asada is good, but the pastor is even better!  If you're looking for authentic and delicious Mexican food - look no further!"}
{"text":"Everything here is DELICIOUS and authentic. Being from Chihuahua myself, the food reminds me of my mom and grandmother's food."}
{"text":"IM ADDICTED!!!! Tacos Chiwas is the best ever. Carnitas taco and the Rajas. Every time."}
{"text":"I don't always write a review but when I do, its because the place was fantastic. Friendly service, homemade tortillas, and excellent tacos. The tripas and pastor tacos are my favorite."}
{"text":"Solid and well priced Northern Mexican street fare to be sure.  All of the unmitigated love placed on this place from the Yelp community, however, has me wondering if you guys have been to any of the great taco shops in South and West Phoenix.  While Chiwas is great keep in mind that there are so many gems like this in our fair Valley if you are willing to leave the safe environs of Central Phoenix or Scottsdale.  Nevertheless the owners execute this very well and do a great job of placing some lesser known Chihuahuan gems next to our typical favorites."}
{"text":"My new favorite taco place. I used to only eat tripe tacos in Yuma (a 3hour drive, yikes). Now this is an 8 min drive and everything about it is 5stars!  Friendly and fast service, great little salsa bar area, the tacos and in house made tortillas - all wins!"}
{"text":"Tacos Chiwas knocks it out of the park.  I visited Tacos Chiwas after reading reviews and viewing pictures from a fellow yelper. Tacos Chiwas is a type of no-frills restaurant  that you turn to when you know exactly what you want. So if what you want is piles of meat, cradled inside steaming hot corn tortillas, you need to go to Tacos Chiwas, because the folks at Tacos Chiwas, knock taco making out of the park.  Tacos Chiwas is a family owned business that has a warm and welcoming vibe, which is always a plus. However, the real plus to Tacos Chiwas is the quality of the food, service, and products. So if you were under the impression that tacos had to be complicated, with complex sauces, lots of  garnish, served on fancy plates, think again.  On my first visit to Tacos Chiwas I had the Carne Asada and Al Pastor tacos. The meat in these tacos was tender, flavorful, and practically melted in my mouth. The Carne Asada Taco is stuffed with bubbling, juicy bits of lightly marinated skirt steak, nestled in a warm homemade tortilla, delicious doesn't begin to describe the Carne Asada Taco. However, I couldn't possibly overlook the Al Pastor with its sweet meat, topped with onions and cilantro, so flavorful, moist, and delicious, I could have ate a dozen.   I am looking forward to my next visit to Tacos Chiwas, I can't want to try everything. I can't say enough about Tacos Chiwas, if you want delicious tacos, burittos, gorditas, frijoles, rice  with great service and local flavors go to Tacos Chiwas."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous al pastor tacos and super  friendly service. This place is a find for anyone that likes great REAL hand held Mexican food! Give it a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Tacos you'll dream about! Greasy, authentic tacos, fun little salsa bar. Great with some local beer. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Although I think the tacos are a overpriced, they are absolutely delicious! The home made tortilla makes a huge difference! Definitely a place to satisfy your tacos craving"}
{"text":"This place is amazing as far as food. The service is a little slow simply because they are making the food fresh for you...and they might be a little understaffed. The bean soup is amazing!!! Second to that I would recommend the flour gorditas. Red chile were the best, followed by rajas (stips of chile with cheese), didn't care too much for the green chile but next to try would be the picadillo. Tacos are unique because the lady is making the tortillas right in front of you and they are soft and fresh. Only down side is the place is super small with only about 4 booths and 4 tables. Not good for big parties but would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Just back from Mexico, this place is so tasty!!!  I am glad I finally made it here! The carnitas were a little messy, but so yum!  The calabitas will be my usual order!  Looking forward to their new adventure @ Roland's with C. B.!!!  I will return!!!"}
{"text":"So good. Tacos Chiwas (their namesake) are amazing with ham, beef, green chiles, cheese, and all sorts of deliciousness. I've also had the red and green deshebrada burritos as well as the pastor. Full of flavor and filling! You can get Red or green sauces, which also have great flavor and a perfect amount of heat. Very affordable, and delicious."}
{"text":"So so delicious! I want to go back to try the other options outside of the tacos. I tried 4 different tacos (chicken, beef, al pastor, tacos chiwas). They were great, but the Tacos Chiwas was the BEST and I would go back and just get those.  Friendly staff - but a bit understaffed. Please respect the establishment and listen for your order number to be called."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great salsa bar and chopped cucumbers, radish, grilled onions, chilled. I ordered rajas, it's stuffed with poblanos, Anaheim chilies, cheese, beans, one is enough for a lighter eater. Love this place, clean, great service. The salsas were ALL great!"}
{"text":"Food tasted fine, employees friendly, eating area clean. Met my expectations.  If you do not expect huge portions of Mexican food, you will enjoy.  I did like the fact you can get your receipt emailed to you instead of getting a slip of paper.  I think all places should do that and avoid cutting extra trees."}
{"text":"Oh my God!! So good! Tacos are bomb and the red shredded beef Gordita was to die for! Wish I would've tried this spot earlier."}
{"text":"Got three tacos: Chiwas, Lengua, and Pastor. All excellent on their own, made even better with pickled onions, salsa, and radishes from the bar. Anxious to try more menu items."}
{"text":"So, I decided to stop in here for lunch on a Friday afternoon and I had two tacos. I ordered the Taco Chiwas and it was a toss up between the Lengua or the Tripas. I had never had either of the last two options so I wanted to venture out. I told the girl taking the order to surprise me and make the decision for me (she looked kind of shocked when I told her this but I told her I know what both are and I can't make up my mind on which option to try first so she can make it for me). My two tacos came and she ordered me the Lengua. I started with that and it just melted in my mouth! It was fantastic! I told her that her choice was awesome and she said it was her favorite one. Next I ate the Taco Chiwas and again that was another good choice. I cannot wait to go back and now try the Tripas and other items!"}
{"text":"how can people mess up Mexican food!  These stupid \"woman\" tacos stink!  Go to Los Dos Molinos on Cnentral if you want killer Mexican.  Watch out for the backlash on the Margs!!!  Can you say UBER!!"}
{"text":"This are one of the best taco spots in the area. Period. Their pastor is delicious! The ONLY complain I had is that they produce so much waste! All their dishes are styrofoam which is a huge pollutant that's not recyclable. They should really change this as become more environmentally friendly."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Total neighborhood joint, counter service, small dining room inside, and cute patio with communal tables out front.  It's a small menu, which I appreciate. They do a small number of things, and they do them well. Tacos are all excellent (there's even a vegetarian option- calabacitas), the gorditas are delicious (choice of red or green sauce. The red is divine), but for me, the Pastor Burrito was life changing. Perfect blend of flavorful and spicy, the flour tortilla holds up to the filling but still melts in your mouth, and it's large enough for a meal. Sooooo good! I even catered a party for 40 people with them recently. There is no specific catering menu- I simply ordered a metric ton of tacos & quesadillas, gave them a few days notice, and paid in advance. The service was wonderful, and guests raved about the food. Not a single taco was spared. If you're looking for a hole in the wall gem, this is it."}
{"text":"Great taco shop! Small seating but cute and clean. Fresh corn tortillas are amazing and there's a nice salsa bar too."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch due to having read an article about it. Wow! So good. I only tried two types of tacos, but they were both amazing. I'd like to eat more, but I'm full after three tacos - 2 tacos chiwas and 1 taco pollo. They were both delicious, but I have to say the chicken was my favorite. It was more than an average street taco. It had a nice flavor balance to it. I don't know if the onions had some vinegar or what the flavors came from but it was just delicious. I'm pretty sure I'll be back on Monday."}
{"text":"Omg. Sooo good. The inside is a little small but the food is delicious and authentic."}
{"text":"Tasty tacos!  Chill vibe.  Wasn't sold on the charro beans - but that's a personal preference.  Totally recommend this spot"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch with a coworker. Loved their tacos, it's very tasty and they also provide condiments such as chilis, red, and green sauce, grilled onions, radishes, cucumbers, and peppers! The wait is not long but be prepared to wait for you food, it took about 15 minutes to get ours so a total of 20 minutes of waiting for our food. Their food is affordable between 2-10 dollars."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this spot for lunch after all the positive reviews...what a let down. Ordered al Pastor burrito instead of tacos....perhaps that was my mistake. It was essentially a tasteless bean burrito with a little bit of dry, al pastor meat. To me it's insulting to put refried beans in an al pastor burrito....at least annouce that you do so on your menu (nothing) so you customer can make an informed decision...the guy in booth next to me had the same complaint.   If your going to have burritos you have to bring it in this town."}
{"text":"Definitely prejudged this hole in the wall. The taco chiwas are exceptional!   I'd go back any day."}
{"text":"Not bad but not great. I had a selection of street tacos. Carne asada, taco chiwas with ham, carnitas and  pollo. I liked the salsa bar. Im going to give this place another chance because i want the Mom and Pops places to get my money.  Fingers crossed."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible. The chicken is out of this world, I highly recommend the chicken tacos and the shredded beef with red sauce gordita.   Everything I've had so far has been amazing, it's all so flavorful. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant and the outside picnic tables.   This is a place I crave almost weekly, definitely check it out."}
{"text":"This was a slightly above average taco joint.  Went for Lunch on 12/1.  I know of better taco places in the valley but this one is pretty good.  Not 5 stars good but good.  Why do you have a salsa bar and no chips??????"}
{"text":"Undoubtedly 5 star tacos.  All tortillas are hand made and fresh with every taco. Highly recommend which I believe to be the highlight of their taco lineup the \"Chiwas taco\".(combination of meats).  A close second would be their Carne Asada taco,(meat prepared medium rare~ LOVE IT) which I personally believe could benefit from some avocado based salsa option but still excellent with out.    Tacos are smaller, but plenty of meat and garnish with each one.  I personally would recommend 6-7 tacos to be satisfied.   Small place , attentive staff, could also benefit from a drive thru.   Thank you and we'll be back with some friends!"}
{"text":"Yummy lengua taco and verde Gordita. Very busy place but still great Great customer service. Will be back"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a snack this afternoon. I've been hearing about this place for sometime and I really wanted to check it out. I had the specialty of the house which is the tacos chiwas and the pastor. Pastor had great flavor in the marinade, just hoped for a bit more tender. The chiwas had asada, ham, hatch chilies, cheese...inhaled both. Salsa verde and rojo were both on point!  I an see coming back with an appetite and crushing 10 or 15 of these. Super yummy!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner last week and had the most amazing tacos. They were all fantastic, but the tripas tacos was probably the best one I have ever had. They were crispy and made a nice contrast against the homemade corn tortillas. I love their salsa bar with homemade salsas and roasted Serrano chilies. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this restaurant while driving around my neighborhood. I have since invited anyone I can. The tacos are amazing. Simple and impeccably executed. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Went to this place cuz everyone was saying it was dank. Highly not dank. I left disappointed. Ordered three tacos that were not worth the 8 dollars...average at best . Also ordered a carne asada burrito. It was mostly beans and really small. I've had ones twice as big for a cheaper price. Salsa  had no flavor. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"The beans are a must. They hit that special spot in your soul, like a good bowl of chili or a plate of pasta with bolognese. The tacos are some of the best I've had in Phoenix. The salsa bar can't compare with a place like La Santisima, but it's OK because the tacos don't need much in the way of dressing. This is just good Mexican food."}
{"text":"We will definitely go back! I had the gorditas and they were really good.  The salsa bar is really nice. Friendly and quick service.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic find! We were looking for a hole in the wall place for Mexican food (those are typically the best). Well, this place does not disappoint. I tired the taco chiwas and the gordito. Both were on point. It was so good that after I ate, I ordered again. It was pretty cheap and the staff was very friendly. They also had Mexican coke and jarittos. All in all, a tasty find. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The tacos took a bit of time to come out but they are really good and worth the wait. Unfortunately, they are smaller tacos. I ordered 4 tacos and a gordita to get comfortably full. I like the little salsa veggie bar that they have in the seating area with the pickled jalapeños , fresh cucumbers, limes, and the salsa. The tortillas tasted really fresh and had a nice texture. I hate it when I get dry tortillas with a weird texture. I tried different types of meats. They were all seasoned nicely and very juicy. My favorite was the carne asade though. The meat was so tender and flavorful. The gordita was nothing to write home about. I also ordered an horchata and it was delicious. It had a really nice balance of cinnamon flavor, rice milk flavor, and creaminess. The restaurant was small but they have about 6 or so small tables.   I would come back here again. Next time, I plan to get a burrito."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in a long time!!! Felt like I was in Mexico! Great service and great taste!"}
{"text":"When I'm East of downtown Phoenix Tacos Chiwas is my go to place for excellent, affordable street tacos.  Slang for Chihuahua, Taco Chiwas serves up authentic food inspired  from that of the Mexican State South of El Paso, Texas; where the family hails from. If you like real tacos you'll be glad you tried this friendly shop out.  The Parking lot is small and a bit tricky. The indoor restaurant only seats about thirty but there is outside seating as well but dining alongside of a busy street isn't high on my list. That being said, I've never had to wait for seating inside. Trust me. This family knocks out their competition and at a fraction of the price. I don't know what's up with Yelp but Tacos Chiwas is open 7 days a week. Call them to be sure."}
{"text":"This place is great for taco tuesdays. I order 3 tacos and when I was done with them I ordered 3 more! That's how good it was! They have a salsa bar that was 5 or 6 different types of salsa which is really awesome cause, you can try all of them to add variety in your life. One caveat is that this place isn't as clean as I would like it to be, but I did not get sick or anything and the service was good."}
{"text":"Growing up in LA gave me an advantage experiencing diverse cultures & food, so moving to PHX has me longing for flavor. Unfortunately, to my experience AZ has fallen short of my expectations, nonetheless I keep searching. Never give up. In my slow quest, I happened to read upon Tacos Chiwas. So, on my birthday we decided to venture out & find out for ourselves whether the hype was real. After all, tacos are life.   Upon reviewing the menu I was shocked to discover the price of a taco $2.50, say what?!? $0.50 more gets you a gorda. Then I noticed $6.00 for a burrito. Trying to stay positive & not let this impact our experience, we think perhaps the price signifies large portions. Therefore, we anxiously wait for our carne asada burrito, al pastor taco, & gordita de rajas. All for $22. What a joke when we receive our order, ni para una muela. Carne asada was tender, somewhat flavorless & scarce. Al pastor was full of flavor. Rajas were okay, I personally would add queso fresco & sour cream. The salsa bar had a variety of salsas, alongside radishes & cucumbers . Our pick was the red salsa, a bit spicy. The grilled onions & jalapeños are cold, usually served warm at most taco spots . The best part was probably the  modelos, no lie. I'm kidding, the music had us moving & singing along. Although it was not 100, glad we are making progress checking off places from our bookmark list. On to the next!"}
{"text":"Decent taste, but burritos were maybe half-filled.  For the price, quite disappointed.  I don't mind paying $6 or $7 for a good burrito, but it should be a good burrito.  This one was filled maybe half full and when i got home i was more than a bit surprised.  I'll try a second time some day, but first impressions matter and skimping on quantity isn't a good sign."}
{"text":"Tacos Chiwas is our new favorite spot. There's always room to sit and enjoy your food whether it's in or outside. Food is always good, hot and fresh. I eat like a cow and pricing is reasonable; normally $30 for two people for food and drinks... Did I mention I eat a lot?"}
{"text":"Just another typical low quality taco place. Prices are High for tiny little tacos. The tortilla was good quality but the meats leave a lot to be desired. The charros bean soup tasted good but I saw little pieces of hot dog cut up in there!  Really, hot dogs!  I'm a person who strives to eat rather healthy and this is not the place to do it!"}
{"text":"The tacos were great, reasonably priced. The barbacoa, and lengua tacos are a must try. The next visit will be the quesadilla, or gordita choices."}
{"text":"Drive by this place many times but only recently stopped. Can't believe I waited so long to taste this deliciousness! I even brought my husband back the next day and he loved it too. Awesome place, good prices and nice staff. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My business used to be located within walking distance to Chiwas and not a day goes by that I don't miss them.   My absolute favorite menu item is their award winning beans, which I believe has made this place a destination spot. Another must-try is the rajas gordita. No other description besides I'm sorry you haven't already tried it.   Chiwas' Instagram account is always updated which is important for me as a customer. Service is genuine and kind and the owners are super cool. 5 stars isn't enough!"}
{"text":"Best taco there, hands down was the barbaccoa. It's moist and seasoned to perfection. Also enjoyed the chicken one. Parking sucks and there is usually always a line to get food. The price was a little much for street tacos, especially on taco Tuesday. Overall, i would return for more which is always a good thing"}
{"text":"I order tacos through UberEats. The tacos were overpriced and they charge for Salsa. The tacos were okay and I had better at other places. Not impressed. I had the tongue tacos. They were super bland."}
{"text":"Great tacos! I always order the al pastor tacos and I recently tried their special quesadilla. The quesadilla is saltier than what I'm used too, but delicious nonetheless. Worth sharing with a friend if want to jazz up your taco Tuesday order."}
{"text":"All of the traditional favorites--al pastor, carnitas, barbacoa, lingua (tongue). So good!"}
{"text":"AMAZING, inexpensive and delicious. Real deal tacos! Super casual and fast, but much better quality than \"fast-food\" tacos. yummmmm."}
{"text":"Really impressed.  Portions are on the smaller side but 3 tacos was the perfect amount for me. Tasted very fresh, authentic, and delicious.  I got 2 Carne Asada tacos and 1 Calabacita taco, both were equally delicious.  The light green sauce was amazing. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos and great horchata. Always busy but they get the food out quickly! Lunch time is insane as they fill a lot of catering orders, but our food is still usually ready within 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"The best tacos i've had so far. The meat is really tender and the tortillas are what makes such a big difference. Maseca tortillas are BOMB!!!! Definitely recommend to anyone looking for AWESOME tacos!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the tacos barbacoa and the asada gordita. Washed it down with a large horchata. Have to say the asada gordita was my favorite. Homemade tortillas for both take well seasoned meat over the top."}
{"text":"I tried the asada, pastor and carnitas tacos. The carnitas were by far the best! What makes this place unique are the fresh, homemade tortillas!  A very clean place and friendly employees."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this restaurant - he lives in the area. All I can say is you must try this place!!! Met friends and we all had different items. Loved them all!!!  Salsa bar was great too."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner after a long day at work and I was not disappointed! The frijoles charros were AMAZING. I also tried the taco chiwas which, WOW, the flavor combination is one of a kind! The staff was friendly and the space was tidy.  Another customer overheard me mention it was my first time there and he told me \"you won't regret it\". He was correct! I'm so glad we have local, non-chain places like this to enjoy. I will definitely be back and I'm excited to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Simple and bomb!!! Al Pastor is bomb!!! Tortillas are bomb!!! Salsa bar is bomb!!! Do yourself a favor and come and try it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Great place for some delicious tacos and burritos, their homemade frijoles and their rice go out fast so come early to taste them. Very clean place and their people are very courteous, there salsa bar is very good and they keep their salsas cold (a big plus for freshness!)."}
{"text":"With one taste of the legit Horchata I was hooked. Growing up in the southern part of the great state of TX I have very high standards on Mexican food. I understand that TexMex is regional and don't expect that style when I go out. That being said, I expect good spice and quality nuances from Mexican restaurants.   FOUND IT HERE!  Horchata = Homemade  Barbacoa = Perfect tenderness and flavor Beans = $&/;?!8:9;)4! GOOD"}
{"text":"To start on a positive note, their Horchata is super tasty, it taste homemade and I really enjoyed it! We ordered tacos de asada, and I must say I was a bit disappointed. I felt that there was a lack of flavor in the meat, although it was soft, it was definitely missing flavor. We also tried the charro beans and they were okay nothing I would say I would go back and buy."}
{"text":"So much hype for this place, i.e. a Guy Fieri visit and teaming up with Valley legend Chris Bianco for a new place called Roland's.   It must have been an off day when we went.  Al pastor is always a go to for a street taco.  But this was dry, grisly and not cut off a spit that I could tell.   The asada was very dry and chewy.  The rajas gordita was pretty good.  It has beans, cheese and some onions.  The red and green version disappointed with the potato cubes.  For us that is just filler. What saved the day for us was the lengua, some of the best we have tasted.  We liked the lengua tacos so much, we ordered a burrito.  Fantastico! Our favorite item at the salsa bar was the grilled onions.  They enhanced everything.  The sauce labeled mild was the hottest.   I noticed a guy with a small to go order piling in the complimentary sliced radishes, cucumbers, grilled peppers and sauces into his bag.  I hope they can keep the salsa bar open.   At nearly $40 not including beverages for three, we left not feeling like we had eaten much.  Everything is quite small.  Oh, and the beans others wrote about before your food is served did not appear.  Maybe that deal is over but I think they need to bring it back.  There did not appear to be any Taco Tuesday specials either. With so many taco joints to try, I doubt we will go back unless the lengua craving hits.  About the only time it is feasible for us is in making an airport run."}
{"text":"My husband brought us here for dinner and all the hype was well worth it! We had tacos, pastor, barbacoa and pollo, very delicious! The tortillas were soft and fresh, they have a salsa bar with various toppings, we tried the guacamole and salsa Rojas, both were delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos we've ever had. Carnitas and the pollo and the specialty taco 'chiwas' were exceptional. The gordito had chill is and cheese and was sweet and delicate. Yum. Yum. Clean place, super kind and helpful staff. Go!!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! After seeing it on Diners, drive ins and dives we have been 3 times and it's been Incredible everytime."}
{"text":"If you're like a good taco this is a great place to go. The service is very friendly and the food taste great. You order the food at the counter and they bring it to your table. It's a small place but the tables are nice. Tables inside and out. Parking is off the street which is good. And it's easy to find.    My wife had tacos and I had a burrito they were both excellent."}
{"text":"Hands Down the best tacos in Phoenix. Handmade Tortillas with perfectly seasoned meats and addicting salsas. The Lengua tacos are perfectly tender.  The Gorditas are just like mi abuelas. You have to get the Chile Rojo!"}
{"text":"This place so bomb & not slow at all. Don't forget to get some sauce or you'll be bummed. The best cure for a hangover. Only complaint is I didn't see one chihuahua."}
{"text":"Mediocre food....terrible customer service! Will not go back. Was so excited to try since it was on 12 news."}
{"text":"My friend A. May suggested this place and I'm sure glad he did! Place is simple and i'd have to say the best taco's i've had. Will most def be back to sample the rest of the menu. I wasn't that hungry when i went so just got 3 taco's; Carne, Pastor and their Chiwas special. All three were amazing. The Pastor was my fav.   If you're in the area you gotta check this place out!"}
{"text":"After seeing the great reviews on Yelp, Tacos Chiwas became a must-try place. We stopped by on a Sunday afternoon close to 1PM. It was pretty busy but there was only one person ahead of us in line so no worries. We put in our order - 3 tacos each - me: chiwas, carnitas, carne asada. Him: carnitas, al pastor, carne asada. We grab the last open table and settle in.   Fast forward to 35 minutes later when we STILL had NO tacos! We went up to complain and said it would be right out. It still took a few more minutes but finally they brought our food. Not sure what took so long but that's way too long for 6 little tacos.  That being said, they were very good. My favorite was the chiwas followed by the carnitas. The asada was just okay IMO. The meat was a little too chewy. The tortillas are really good and don't fall apart like a lot of other places. The tacos are small, street size, so we ended up getting a quesadilla too. That came out quickly and was really good.  I will probably give them another shot since the food was good. Since I don't see a lot of mentions of wait times I'm gonna say it was a fluke and something got messed up. But I might bring a back up snack with me just in case."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS! Going to be my place to go on weekend nights downtown for a great meal. Thr grilled onions and cerrano chilis (dorados!) at the condiment bar were off the chart! Beware though....those chilis are hot!   Small place, friendly staff and fabulous tacos. Had the lengua and asada tacos and they were delicious. Tastey eats!"}
{"text":"FRICKING DELICIOUS. This is now my new favorite taco spot in Phoenix. Obviously I ordered a taco chiwas and gobbled up every last bit. The combination of ham, beef, and cheese was heaven in my mouth. If you go to Tacos Chiwas and don't order a taco chiwas (or like 10 of them) then reevaluate your life choices. I also ordered a carne asada taco, el pastor taco, and frijoles charros (bean soup), and bean/cheese quesadilla- all was quite tasty. Ohhhhh their salsa bar is awesome, great pairings with the tacos. I'll be back Tacos Chiwas!!!"}
{"text":"Great tacos, great salsa in a welcoming environment. My favorite was the Pastor but a friend who got the Chiwas taco said it was incredible. Will be back here many times"}
{"text":"There are those rare times when you imagine how good a meal could be and then what you actually have exceeds it."}
{"text":"Awesome everything here!!! This is worth the mile detour from the interstate. The Pastor is the most flavorful I've ever found in the US. Especially excellent for AZ mexican. Enjoy"}
{"text":"These tacos are the best. At 2.50 a pop it's hard to pass up getting one of each. Asada, pollo, barbcoa, it doesn't matter they are all so delicious. Next up is trying the breakfast menu. Bfast is only served from 10(open) till noon though so get here early."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos and burritos. We tried the lengua burrito and asada tacos and everything was delicious. We were recommended this spot by our host for the evening. And it was well worth the walk"}
{"text":"I totally agree with the previous 3 star review. I was so looking forward to this and was completely underwhelmed.  My sister ordered 2 carne Asada, 2 pastor, 1 chiwas taco, and bean soup. It was cheap but not as cheap as other taco places and was about $12 for each of us. The food came out super fast which was awesome and the salsa bar was also great. I really liked the salsa. The Asada tacos were the best but definitely not as good as la santisima. The pastor tacos were super dry and the chiwas tacos was underwhelming and not worth it. The bean soup was good but desperately needed salt or needed to be more spicy. It had chorizo, hot dogs, chicarrones, and ham in it. I see it being really good comfort food, but for someone who didn't grow up with a Mexican grandma, it just wasn't great.   Overall this place isn't bad, but with la santisima just around the corner I see absolutely no reason to come back here."}
{"text":"This is the real deal.  People come here for delicious tacos and burritos.  People do not come here for clean tables, clean floors, clean restrooms.  It's a dive, but the food makes you look past all that."}
{"text":"Best tacos in The Valley!! The tortillas are hand made there and the meat is always tender and delicious! The Al Pastor tacos are to die for, but so are the beans, and the rajas Gorditas! This place has a small local business feel without being overly hip. It's perfect! The service is always great too."}
{"text":"These tacos are good... the tortilla is pretty tasty, the meat isn't as tasty... this is the second time trying them, and I just don't get why people say they're \"so good\". I prefer traditional, cilantro/white onion, tortilla lightly fried w the meat's oil, Mexican street tacos. Tacos Huicho is right down the street, go there  10/10"}
{"text":"Now I will say the tacos are a little on the higher priced size, but they are big and extremely fresh. Quality food and friendly service. Who doesn't love a local eatery!"}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior scare you. This place is delicious! I got 3 tacos: tacos Chiwas, pastor, and Asada. All three tacos were fantastic. The pastor is the best pastor I've ever eaten and I don't even like pork. If you come here, come for the pastor!! It's worth it."}
{"text":"Bomb.com Some of the best Mexican food we have found in the Phoenix area. 10/10 would reccomend. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Holy moly!  The Carne Asada burrito was fantastic. I'll be back to try each of the tacos"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Enjoy their tacos and gorditas.  My favorite filling is their tripe fried crispy, clean and delicious.   Without the Andrew Zimmern barn yard effect."}
{"text":"We originally stopped by Tacos Chiwas after they recently opened - thanks to a nice Instagram plug by the owner's former employer, famed-chef Chris Bianco. Back then, parking was easy and lines were short. Since then, we've visited several other times and watched their popularity quickly grow.  Arguably, their best option is clearly the chiwas taco. It consists of beef, ham, cheese, jalapeno and chiles. Their other tacos are mostly subjective based on personal taste. My girlfriend and I both agree that their tacos are good, but describing them as being leagues above many of the other reputable joints in Phoenix is a bit of an overstatement. Unfortunately, tripas and lengua scare the hell out of me, so I can't really provide an opinion on those until I grow some huevos.  Order the bean soup as a side. It's extremely meaty and great quality for the price you pay. I'm also a big fan of their no-nonsense asadero quesadilla, which I've ordered on both occasions. Wash everything down with a Mexican Coke and you're good to go!  One article I read described Chiwas as being a \"local hangout\" for chefs in the Valley. During our last visit, I fully expected to see Chris Bianco, Kevin Binkley, and Doug Robson all shooting the breeze, sharing a plate full of a dozen rajas gorditas. Unfortunately, I just saw what looked like regulars.  Although I do question if the hype is a bit too high, I strongly feel that Chiwas is fully deserving of their growing success.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have to say these are the best taco's I had in Phoenix by far. Authentic, and delicious. Ate 4 of them, and contemplated ordering 4 more to go.  I'm just sorry to say I waited until 2 days before moving out of town to go there. Do yourself a favor and check them out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I grew up with Mexican food and we love this place! The Frijoles charros (they're beans but like with stuff) are SO GOOD. and the meats in their tacos is perfect and we love their breakfast burritos. We are glad to see the place getting more business and hope it stays around for a long time!!!"}
{"text":"The other reviews are accurate!! This place is delish! I tried 3 tacos, pastor, asada, and carnitas. They were all so good! Meat was tender and juicy! This place offers higher quality street tacos for taco stand prices! The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly! Try it!"}
{"text":"Tacos didn't have much flavor. Once the onions, chilis and salsa was added they were decent."}
{"text":"Try anything and everything!!  My boys love the bean and cheese burritos.  I love the Tacos Chiwas.  Tried the Tripas Taco and the Chicharone (sp) with the salsa verde.  Superb in every way.  Coming back on Saturday!!"}
{"text":"The best tacos and burritos I have tried in Phoenix, hands down! I grew up in Chihuahua and I can assure you this it the most authentic Mexican restaurant I have been to on this side of the river. I loved the food, the service, the atmosphere with the cumbia music playing and the salsa bar. From now on, this will be my go to place whenever I'm craving Mexican food :D"}
{"text":"absolutely nothing to complain about here, fresh and spicy mexican, you can literally see your tortillas getting made while you wait, fantastic little spot. i like things hot and even i was sweating it out"}
{"text":"BEST TACOS EVER!!!  I think these are the best tacos Ive had in the valley. Very friendly people. If you are around the area I would suggest trying it out. My husband and I tried all of the tacos except  the tripe. My favorite was the taco chiwas. So good!"}
{"text":"YUM!!! This place won Phoenix Magazine's 2016 best tacos and I can totally see why. It's awesome! Split a taco Chiwas/Asada/Pastor/Tinga (special of the day) and a gordita desebrada roja. They are all delicious. That gordita is crave worthy! The meats are all perfectly cooked and the tortillas were fresh and delicious. The salsas are really good and adding the blistered green chiles to the tacos have a nice bit of flavor and heat. Can't recommend this place enough!  We will be coming back again before the end of the vacation."}
{"text":"Ok good but no beans tho...burritos (vegan) kinda of runny and watery.... dad said the lengua tacos and burritos were but I don't eat that shit....."}
{"text":"Get the lengua. I eat a lot of beef tongue tacos (it helps to distinguish which places can do more than carnitas) and these are the best I can ever remember having. Friendly staff. I can't wait to go back and try more!!"}
{"text":"Soooo good. I had the tripe and lengua tacos and tacos chiwas. Very casual but a cool vibe sitting outside. Don't miss the horchata and the fresh made salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Yum.  Authentic,  no frills, impeccably seasoned and every salsa is delicious.  Tried the shredded red beef and hatch green chile/ cheese gorditas and they were absolutely delicious with a nice thin layer of beans.  We also tried the tripas, carne asada, and pastor tacos- all great, and the tripas were nice and crispy which was a real treat.  They were out of lengua today, but we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great! What stood out was the tortillas, beans, menu (tripe and beef tongue!), seasoning and most of all attention to detail. Great char and texture with the Asada. The verde godita was legit also. They aren't playing around. A foodies fast Mexican food, I hope they keep it up and change nothing."}
{"text":"Such good taco.... And other things that are cooked on the stove top are good too. Can be on the pricey side for some things."}
{"text":"This place has by far the best tacos in all of phx and that's a big claim considering there's a taco shop on every block. Taco tortillas made to order. Amazing flavor is absolutely everything and a great bar of homemade salsa."}
{"text":"Great environment, awesome service, and the most important thing exquisite freshly made tortillas for some really tasty tacos."}
{"text":"The tacos were authentic tasting and reasonably priced. The cheese quesadilla was too cheesy for me (sounds ridiculous to say that) it was still yummy. The Jamaica drink was very refreshing!"}
{"text":"Fair to midland on this place! Lacked ventilation inside the restaurant and way to much smoke! Tacos were so so..had better in the Phoenix area that were more tastier and filling. Very limited beverages.. most Mexican places I go to usually have Pina. This place was highly recommended by some friends and somewhat disappointed it wasn't as good as they said it is!! At least we tried it."}
{"text":"The tacos were so good, the vibe was great. Honestly just a great spot to hang out and eat some delicious food"}
{"text":"We went here cause my family is from Chihuahua so I thought we would give it a try. We were in love after best gorditas I have ever had in the USA. My girls even said they reminded them of grandmas cooking."}
{"text":"This place is always on point some of the Best Authentic Mexican Food in Az. Friendly Staff, Always Spotless Clean, Cheap Prices, if you've never tried it your missing out"}
{"text":"The service was really good, very friendly.  I honestly just thought the food sucked, which I was really surprised by, because it had a lot of hype. I'm not really sure what else to say.  It just wasn't good.  Maybe I went on a bad day?"}
{"text":"Yummm! Delicious tacos and gorditas. Fast and good! Casual taco shop but they know what they're doing!"}
{"text":"A stop for lunch on the way to the airport (5 minutes from the rental car return) had me picking up dinner for the plane too!    The tacos chiwas were really flavorful; gorditos with refried beans, ground beef, carrots & potatoes was an unexpected pocket of yumminess; and chicharone (pork skin) taco was great.  Yummy fried onions to top it off at the salsa bar was good.   Not a lot of parking or tables inside, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"it must be the style of tacos that is just strange. i did not feel like they were flavorful and they are definitely too expensive. i paid 2.75 for one taco..that is just crazy."}
{"text":"yum, if you just want a good street taco this is the place. Nothing fancy about it just good freshly made to order corn torts. Not a large menu they just focus on the taco."}
{"text":"Best tacos when heading to airport!!!! Fast friendly service and the food is outstanding!!! Especially the bean soup!!!! Definitely a must try and only 5 minutes from car rental return!!!!"}
{"text":"Tacos were excellent, gorditas were great, and the burrito wasn't bad. Deshebrada rojo an deshebrada verde are both great choices but I was especially happy to see the Mexican beer choices: Indio, corona, Pacifico, modelo, and Dos Equis."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I have ever had!! The Chiwas tacos where unique and the pastor just sung! All on homemade tortillas."}
{"text":"Nice & clean; good/fast service. The ham in the tacos chiwas makes it very flavorful. Overall, good tacos."}
{"text":"Delicious tortillas! I have only had the bean and cheese burrito and the quesadilla - both very good :) the little caramel in an ice cream cone was good and I dislike caramel... very authentic and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"I came here when I was visiting Phoenix. Mind you I'm Hispanic from LA. I know dank taco trucks and grew up around good tacos. This place is legit, it felt like a real establishment and the food was authentic. Even the beer selection wasn't bad they had all the staples of a good taco spot. Salsa's were dank as well."}
{"text":"The gorditas here are authentic and amazing. I wish the place was bigger and had more parking, it gets super packed, but other than that it's great here. The cashier was nice and my order was correct."}
{"text":"I tried tacos chiwas for the first time last night it was very good no frills but excellent quality of food. I had the coyo taco and the Carnitas Taco both of which for delicious and I love the pickled onion. serving sizes are very small so make sure to order accordingly. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to grab a bite that's open on Sunday's and came across Tacos Chiwas. Their tacos are the real deal. Everything is fresh, they even have a salsa bar with homemade salsa, not that out of the jar stuff. The person that took our order (the owner it seemed) was very friendly and helpful in explaining what each item was as well as the person that brought us our food letting us know about the salsa bar.  It's a basic order at the counter and have a seat kind of place but the tacos, especially the carnitas, are tasty and definitely worth a try. We have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"While the food was good, the portion for the price left something to be desired. Like, more food."}
{"text":"Really good Carne asada tacos. We tried carnitas, Carne asada, taco chiwas, and pastor. They were all pretty solid but thought the Carne asada was the best. They have a really good guacamole salsa is the way I would describe it. They are a little pricey for a taco shop but you can tell they use higher quality meat and can see them making the tortillas fresh in the back. Will be back."}
{"text":"Definitely coming here again!  Quick service, great tasting food, and overall good experience.  Was a recommendation from a local barista...so glad because I visited another \"Mexican\" restaurant in Phoenix and was sorely disappointed! I almost gave up in searching for actual Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The service is fast and very nice. The tacos and gorditas are delicious. It is great to see people coming back over and over. I will definitely be coming back here. Really good"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food. My favorite is Al pastor Burrito or Tacos. I will bring all my friends to this great place."}
{"text":"Fresh made tortillas for each plate, perfectly marinated carne asada, calabacitas like your mom made, this place has more than you can imagine and will blow your taste buds away! Give this place a whirl!!!"}
{"text":"BEST TACOS EVER!!! Anytime I need a taco fix I go straight to Tacos Chiwas. The quesadilla is hands down the best quesadilla I've ever had. Love that they have a serve yourself salsa bar too."}
{"text":"Addicted to this place. I may or may not have eaten here two days in a row. I recommend the gorditas! Everything about the food screams authentic."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good ordered some beans and tacos. Beans were better than most you will find at other Mexican food places in the area. The tacos were simple and pretty good a hair dry for my liking they could use a little something else I think like pico de gallo or something."}
{"text":"This place puts out great food !! Hole in the wall right off the 51  freeway at McDowell Rd .. you will not be disappointed..   The menu has the basics .. tacos, gorditas, quesadillas & burritos.. lots of meat options..   On today's visit I had the carnitas & al pastor tacos served on corn tortillas.. tacos are on the smaller side.. but the flavors were spot on .. meat is tender and flavorful.. very good..   and the rajas gordita (because it sounded delicious) .. the gordita is stuffed with roasted hatch chilis, jalapeños & white asadero cheese (the kind that melts into gooey cheese .. used in quesadillas) .. this menu item is a MUST try.. you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Good tacos I would get the tostada if I was you or the street tacos how much did you get really good"}
{"text":"I loved the tacos and gorditas ! It's not greasy at all , the beans are delicious And reasonable priced ."}
{"text":"I love this place! Definitely my weakness. This is authentic Mexican food. My family is from Chihuahua, Mexico. This is the food I grew up eating. They make their tacos with homemade tortillas which is hard to find in any taco place. I'm always perfectly satisfied with the portions. The rajas gordita is my favorite along with the tripas tacos. The deshebrada meat is also very good in both green and red. Potatoes are not just a filler as somebody mentioned in their review. This is how it is authentically made in Chihuahua."}
{"text":"Food was amazing here ! Only thing i gotta say is that the portion is too little for the price. Tacos are small but mannnn they are yummy! And I recommend trying the gorditas! On point  its little and so comfy in there and everyone is so friendly! I love it. Will come back, this time with more money  lmao"}
{"text":"Seriously, these are the best tacos in Phoenix. I've been on a search for a great street taco, and I've found it. I had the barbacoa, pastor, and asada, and all were fantastic. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Their barbacoa was more like a bomb.com-coa!!! Very good prices for the quality and similar to the home cooking I get when I visit friends from that region of Mexico. I also recommend their pastor tacos they season those too perfect!  Third time here and also consistent.  Great location off the freeway and very friendly and fast staff."}
{"text":"Ohhhh myyyyy! Homemade tortillas, great salsas, meats inside tacos seasoned to perfection and lastly... They gave us a sample of a ham and bean soup that was so divine!!! This place is a can't miss!!! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Some really good street tacos usually get the al pastor and tacos chiwas with frijoles charros"}
{"text":"I just got yelp today but I ate here a month ago... this place was good enough that it was the one of the first restaurants that came to mind. SOOOO good. The carne asada taco is amazing. The handmade tortillas are also to die for, along with the frijoles charros. So creamy and delicious. If my husband is ever in a bad mood, I like to bring him home some Tacos Chiwas and it works every time."}
{"text":"So growing up in LA al pastor was my favorite taco. I have not anything even close to home. BAM tacos chiwas nailed it. I cant get enough and the frijoles charros are amazing. Simple like nana used to make. Come here now wow"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite taco shops, luckily it's a 3-minute drive from my place. My fiance and I have brought friends here and they absolutely love their food. When coming we usually order the tripas, asada, and pastor tacos. All of them are so good, but our favorite is tripas. I have never been a fan of tripas until I walked into this place. If you do not know what tripas is, it's the small intestine of an animal I know it sounds gross. The tripas here are do crispy and flavorful.   If you are in the area defiantly give this place a try. I guarantee you will be back for me."}
{"text":"Kept an eye out for Tacos Chiwas especially after reading all the rave reviews and put it out on my Bookmarks list.  Decided to get their tacos to see they really live up to the hype. I got their Pastor, Asada and Chiwas tacos.  Perhaps I'm used to and biased towards Cal-Mex food as I found the tacos here to be just okay. The Pastor and Asada were good, lots of meat and topped with cilantro, raw chopped onion and pickled onion for the Asada tacos. The chiwas taco was topped with queso asadero and carmelized onion. For the meats, I felt that there was a good balanced portion and the toppings accentuated the flavors. However, I was not a fan of the Chiwas as I felt that it would be more fitting inside a flour tortilla, such as if was in a burrito instead with rice. The tortillas are made in house, which differentiates itself from other Mexican spots. Salsas and Limon are self service and kept cool. The salsas were refreshingly light and had a bit of heat.  If found the tacos to be okay, price is a bit high for \"street tacos\". On it's own the tacos were good, but not incredibly amazing in flavor profile compared to the street tacos that I'm accustomed to. After finishing off my tacos, I felt like it was missing something that I often look for whenever eating Mexican in CA.  Staff was nice and service was quick. Price point a little up there for tacos. Plenty of parking and easily visible from the street. They accept cash and card."}
{"text":"We made the mistake of getting breakfast burritos here... they are subpar. That's why their name is TACOS though! One person got tacos and recommends those. The lunch wait is quite some time. And no potatoes for the breakfast burros."}
{"text":"Tacos Chiwas has decent gorditas, but the tacos were unbelievably disappointing, especially given the name of the establishment and its current Yelp rating. Not only are they tacos small but they're also dry with very few ingredients in each one. I tried the al pastor taco and tacos chiwas taco and found both to be pretty bad."}
{"text":"Great small shop with very tasty food. Bueno, bueno, bueno... The burrito, chicken tacos, and quesadilla hit all the right spots. Service is friendly, happy food, satisfied diners."}
{"text":"This place is legit. If you like tacos of any kind you should check this out. The rajas Gordita is my favorite, but everything on the menu fantastic. The staff are also very friendly. Surprisingly it's pretty cheap for quality of food. If you real deal tacos or you like green chiles or if just want the best Phoenix has to offer this is the place."}
{"text":"Had heard great things about this place and finally was in the area to check it out.  Very clean inside and the staff was nice.  Small but focused menu and I ordered two steak tacos and two chicken tacos.  There's a salsa bar too if you want some extra heat.  Verdict on the tacos - good but not great. They are a little on the small side and the meat didn't have much seasoning to it.  Total cost with a soda was $13. I was still hungry after this meal."}
{"text":"Tried this new place on Friday with my entire family and we all fell in love. Between all five of us we had  a wide variety of the options on the menu. Personally I had the Beef tongue taco with onions and tomatoes, the Taco chiwas which has beef, ham, cheese, jalapeno and hatch chilies and the gordita with roasted jalapenos, hatch chilies and cheese, and the frijoles charros. One of my favorite things was the homemade tortillas and this really sets them apart to me I have been to many taco restaurants but I have never actually had any of them give me homemade corn tortillas. The frijoles charros were also a stand out. If you've never had homemade tortillas or frijoles charros just drop whatever your doing and head to Tacos Chiwas. I honestly cannot say enough good things about this place, my mouth is watering just thinking about their food. So glad to finally see an AMAZING taco shop open and not just another okay taco shop."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Eat here.  Eat here all the time.  Like your life depended on it.  And of course, get the tacos. Don't know why it took me so long to get to this place, and I regret not going sooner.  Months of great tacos lost.  I ordered four tacos: al pastor, lengua, chiwas, and tripa.  This place is a tad more expensive than other Mexican joints for tacos that are a little bigger than your average street-style taco.  That is more than made up for in the quality of the tortilla and meat.    I would say the weakest of the four I tried was the al pastor.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I didn't see a spit-roast for the al pastor mat.  A tad dry and a tad less flavorful than the best al pastor that I've had.  Still good, I wouldn't call it bad, but I don't know f I'd order it again given the other options.   The lengua was soft, moist, decently flavored.  Some pieces had a little extra chew to them to add a little textural variation, overall, a very good lengua taco.  The taco chiwa is a combination that I have not tried before.  Beef, ham, cheese, jalapeno and Hatch chiles.  I know this may not make sense, but this combination was subtly flavorful, in a very good way.  The mild cheese balanced out the saltiness of the ham, the beef added the richness and the chiles added the the heat and cut some of the richness.  I expected pops of flavor, but instead, everything mellowed into each other for a balanced, almost \"light\" experience, given that the thing was mostly filed with protein.  The namesake taco here is worth it.  Finally, the tripa.  I think this was the single best taco here.  Cooked chicharron-style, it was clean (not muddy), crispy, and delicious.  I could eat these all day, even with the tortilla.  just pop them in my mouth one by one.  They are that good.  Get over your squeamishness and try the tripa.  It is a treat, becoming more rare to find in the Valley.  (I miss ya Huachinanga.)  A full quarter of my charro beans was meat, which made them some of the most flavorful charro beans I've ever had.  Bits of ham, beef, and chicharron in the broth made the tender beans super meaty and delicious.  My horchata was more than acceptable.  It as pretty good.  So, excellent meat.  Excellent tortillas.  Minimal toppings, as it should be.  All summing up to an excellent taco - one of the best in the Valley, some of the best I've tried in the nation.  (El Chato, look out.)"}
{"text":"Went here because family recommended it. We bought every meat taco they had to sample. The only one that was decent was the chicken. Waste of money. no flavor in the meats, not even the tortillas they used. Even the horchata wasn't good. I'll pass!"}
{"text":"I gave this place 5 stars, the kids gave it 4 stars, and my wife thought it was 3 stars. So, the family average is 4 stars.   I had the tacos Chiwas, Asada, and pollo. Kids had the quesadillas and some tacos. My wife ordered pastor burrito. We added an order of beans for the table.   Everyone was happy and the bill came out to $35. Not bad for five people."}
{"text":"The tacos were juicy, fresh and delicious. They have a couple of sides to choose from. The corn tortillas were nice and thick and didn't break when you pick them up to eat. I was hoping for sides like rice or veggies and the service was nice. The line was long but moved pretty fast."}
{"text":"This place is indeed brand new and thus not many reviews. Nice family owned taco spot with a fabulous salsa bar.  I had three tacos and it was fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"Good stuff.  Nothing fancy.  Just excellent tasting tacos.  Very authentic.  The spicy red salsa is actually spicy!   Bean soup is excellent as was the Asada burrito and pastor taco.  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Closest to Mex we have got!! The tacos de rajas are the bomb!! Calabazas con elote Hubby and kids tore up pastor, asada y carnitas. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I love finding authentic tacos! This little place is clean & authentic! Fresh made corn tortillas YUM!  We had carne asada and pastor tacos, they were delicious! They have a great little salsa bar with guacamole (the street taco type-not the chunky avocado), mild & spicy salsa, sautéed onion, fresh cucumbers & radishes.   My kids & I enjoyed it very much!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Friendly staff, and AMAZING FOOD! As a native of Arizona we have fantastic Mexican food here. Rest assured Tacos Chiwa's does it right!"}
{"text":"Banging tacos!  And they have roasted hot peppers on the toppings bar. Every time I'm in Phoenix, I'm going here."}
{"text":"Some of my favorite carne asada and lengua tacos around! The salsa bar is also super yummy with a perfect combo of flavor and heat    Mixed with a nice cold horchata =  Always friendly staff and always quick with orders."}
{"text":"They don't have rice and beans. The tacos were good, but super small.  It was kind of pricey for the small amount of food"}
{"text":"Solid soft shell tacos. Carnitas were nice and moist but could use a tad more salt/seasoning. House taco was something different but good. Light green salsa was our favorite - a little kick but not too hot."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my self....frijoles charros!!! amazing...my whole family enjoyed food here...very tasty...recommend to all"}
{"text":"Best tacos around. Worth the lines.  10/10 recommend.  I had the calabacita taco - squash, cheese, homemade tortillas. I could eat 20 of these. I also had the rajas gordita - roasted jalapeño, hatch Chiles and asdadero cheese"}
{"text":"First time here. I had the Taco Chiwas and Charro Beans. Deliciousness served on fresh home made corn tortillas topped with guacamole salsa and fresh lime juice. Perfect serving size. Defiantly recommend a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and the food is always five stars. But, can you try and keep the place a little cleaner? The trash is always overflowing and there are flies constantly buzzing around the salsa bar. It's getting to be pretty bad. Don't let this gem fade away. Hire an extra person to keep it clean during the lunch rush and get a pest control company in there. It will be well worth the investment. Don't put all your focus on Roland's and forget about this place. Thanks!"}
{"text":"What this place lacks in decor it makes up in taste in their tacos. The menu is quite small, it consist of tacos, burritos, gorditas and quesadillas. What we were really there for was the tacos and I must say they did not disappoint. My favorites were the carnitas, very flavorful. The only negative was that they were out of chips and Veggie tacos, we were there on a Saturday night.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Little place with big flavor. I took the recommendations of the Rajas gordita my boyfriend had the pastor, Barbacoa and pollo tacos. Very delicious and the sauces were amazing. I love checking out new places. I just wish we lived closer."}
{"text":"Stopped by after church one day and this has become our new favorite taco shop! Now a (sometimes weekly) staple for our family and friends. Amazing tacos and gorditas- outdoor picnic table seating for large groups. Super good!"}
{"text":"Have (amazing) tacos, will travel. Another interesting place that has been featured on Guy Fieri's show and totally worth the exposure. Like other Yelpers have said, it's in a quite unassuming small space off the 51 and McDowell. Forewarning, parking is definitely a premium.   The menu is simple and perfect- tacos, burritos, quesadillas, horchata and a pretty good salsa/toppings bar. Unfortunately when I came with friends they were out of sautéed onions, but the salsas were a-plenty. Just maybe a little too spicy for my pref. Because I had worked out before, I was uber hungry and easily ate 5 tacos.  With #BestWeatherEverSeason upon us, we sat outside on one of their big patio tables. All but a few went with a variety of tacos. The consensus for favorites were Tacos Chiwas & Lengua. I love cabeza tacos, so one of my girlfriends convinced me I would probably like Lengua equally. And actually it's much better especially at Tacos Chiwas! The Al Pastor was ok, just a little too heated spicy for personal pref. Add in a large $3 horchata and it was a fab meal. I basically spent $15 and left a full and happy taco-lover."}
{"text":"Came here to try some tacos based on some Yelp recommendations.  Located off McDowell in Phoenix, and not difficult to miss with good signage.  Parking lot is limited and small, and I didn't see any other alternatives if the lot was full.  The restaurant does offer drive through service.  The inside of the restaurant is also on the small side (-1).  If the place was full, I'm not sure where one would eat if they were dining in.  Staff were friendly and helpful with menu items and ordering.  The menu was conveniently located above the cashier and on the table by the cashier. The one on the table offered more explanations of the menu items versus the menu above.  I ordered three tacos and, sadly, they were very underwhelming - very small and under filled (-1).  It simply wasn't filling to consume just those 3 tacos for dinner.  The filling for the tacos also appeared uninspiring and very dry.  Don't get me wrong, the tacos were tasty.  The sauce station was not as varied or extensive as I've seen at some other places. Probably won't return based on my dissatisfaction with their tacos."}
{"text":"If you are ever hungry for some great tacos but don't want to splurge this is a perfect spot. Super casual, friendly service, and their salsa is just as great as the tacos (recommend the green)! Came in for a to go lunch for my Dad and I. I was greeted by a sweet cashier who was very helpful while I was deciding what to order.   The tacos were great! I had the Carne Asada, Chicken and Al Pastor tacos. The quality of the meat was noticeably above your average taco place. Each taco was delicious but my favorite was definitely the Al Pastor!   I love their salsa bar, but I didn't see any limes or lemons which was kind of a bummer. I also ordered a Horchata which was delicious! And a big plus for me is that they have Mexican bottled soda (cause duh it tastes like a million times better).   I would definitely return here!! Oh and I pray that they utilize their drive thru again because I would be back like yesterday ;)"}
{"text":"Okay, there are not enough stars to rate this place. I only recently learned about it and just happened by today and, and craving a bean burro, I stopped. In full disclosure I leaned as I stopped that this is owned by some friends of the family but I could have said nothing had the food not been so great. I ordered a Burrito de Lenguas and Taquitos de Tripitas and both were excellent. I grew to love tongue growing up as my mother cooked in on occasion when it was on sale but not Mexican style. The owners are from Chihuahua Mexico and hence the name, Tacos Chiwas. As much as I loved the taquitos, the burrito was far better. It is family owned so even more reason to support it. Close to downtown Phoenix for all those there and just off the 51 and McDowell if you are traveling through. You have to try it and I will return!!!"}
{"text":"The food tastes \"okay\", not amazing, not bad, their meat it's definitely better quality than a Filiberto's/Julioberto's, but the big downfall is that their tacos are not filling. Do not go here if you're hungry. Mexican Food and Taco places are known for big portions...not this one.  Their tacos are ridiculously small, and they are way over priced! $3 for a smaller than a mini-taco, taco? No thanks. Maybe I'll give them another shot and try a burrito instead.  The salsa's are \"okay\". The bean soup/frijoles charros was my favorite part of my meal, they have pork in them, and the broth has good consistency.  Place is super small and casual, I would rather do take out than eat there."}
{"text":"This was a great authentic Mexican food! I got a gordita deshebrada verde and rojo and it was very good. I was very impressed with the flavors and uniqueness of it! I will definitely be back for more. Glad my family recommended this place while I was visiting."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried tacos chiwas for the first time. We ordered tripa tacos, tongue tacos, tacos pastor & a side of charro beans. I've tried many tacos in my life but these tacos were not extraordinary in any way. I just thought with the hype on the streets i thought that they would be spectacular. Tacos were small and overpriced and had a undescribable spice that I've never had in my life. The thing that really threw me off were the charro beans. I love beans, I love chicharones and beans but I don't like chopped up hot dog in my beans. I can tell you that my family was from Chihuahua Mexico and I've never had hot dogs in my beans.  I guess this is just a heads up if you don't like hot dogs in your beans probably skip the charros."}
{"text":"Very nice folks who run this place. Polite and prompt. Great great food at a good price! Will go again"}
{"text":"I've been eating out way too much lately. This place is another of a long line of awesome food finds for me this month. Went in for lunch and I have no idea what I ordered but all of it was good and all of my co-workers have been hitting it up repeatedly since. Go here, right now and eat tacos."}
{"text":"It's soooo ovvveeerrrprrrrriiiiiiced. In Phoenix where outstanding, authentic options are nearly limitless, there is no reason to charge $3 for a single taco that can be consumed in literally 2 bites. They don't offer anything that a classic, unassuming hole-in-the-wall doesn't do as well or better for a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"2nd time there... I did take out in the morning, I ordered the Chorizo and egg burro and I asked about adding potatoes but the place does not have any potatoes.  1st time ever that a Mexican restaurant does not serve potatoes, that's unheard of..lol...  I also ordered the bean soup(a must have everytime your there)... FOOD was EXCELLENT.... on their website it says all breakfast burritos are 5$ but their prices must have changed to 5.50 and they haven't updated their website, no big deal.  I thought the burro was alittle small for the price but nonetheless, it was very tasty, probably the best chorizo and egg burro I've ever had.  It had alittle mashed beans in the ends of the burrito.  The bean soup is out of this world.  It's got small cubes of ham I think and a piece of bacon fat.  I can't get over how good it is.  I also took the red sauce from their salsa bar.  It was extremely spicy but oh so good.  I'll get their green salsa next time, the red was just too hot for me.  I also bought a bar of Worlds Finest Chocolate bar for a 1.00.  The total bill was under 10$ so it's very cheap. Now the bad.... the place didn't seem too clean and the young girl cashier who took my order and money wasn't in a good mood, seems like a non people person and her face looked like one big pimple, not something u wanna see in a food establishment.  They have new and improved medicine for that now, please get some and use it.  There was also a slight fly problem, I had to let one out near their side door entrance.  And the salsa bar could have used a wipe down.  Their was also alittle white salsa mixed with the red.  The place was nearly empty and the restaurant should not look like that as soon as it opens... there should be constant cleaning especially when it's not busy and please keep the flies out.  There was also a fly in the cooking area.  That's unacceptable..."}
{"text":"Great street tacos! I really enjoyed the handmade corn tortillas and salsa bar. Finally a corn tortilla that didn't fall apart mid taco. I recommend the pastor and carnitas tacos. Asada was good, but not as good as the other tacos I tried. I wish they had a better ventilation system, I walked out of there smelling like a taco."}
{"text":"Took my family here after reading all the good reviews and I gotta say the food was amazing!!! I want to go back for more already and they will definitely be seeing me a few times a week from now on. The meat was delicious, salsa was perfect, the corn tortillas were yummy and the bean soup was A1! Horchata was good too! New favorite"}
{"text":"Great little lunch place - nicer on the inside than it looks on the outside. Very simple menu, but the food is delicious. Not cheesy or greasy at all (in fact, there wasn't cheese on anything I ordered, and it still tasted great).   Get at least 3 tacos, they are cheap but quite small, basically 3 bites each (for $2.50 a pop)."}
{"text":"I was tricked into going to this place by social media. Overhyped & not even in the top 5 of taco places in the valley.   The place is called TACOS chiwas, so forgive me for primarily trying out just the tacos. If they were called Burritos chiwas, then i would have went a different direction, but back on topic.   I tried out a taco of each variety of their meats. In comparison to their competition their tacos sizes were small, and their prices trended higher.  While most of their meats were kinda bland, the common factor was they were all watery (not to be confused with juicy).   The bean (and ham & hot dog) soup was actually kinda gross. Its like bean flavored water with floating bits of poverty meat scraps.   For being a small taco stand it was nice that they serve beer, alcohol always comes in handy to rescue an average meal."}
{"text":"One of the best taco places in Phoenix area.  We had pastor, pollo, asada and shrimp.  Tortillas soft and fresh.  Line goes fast and food comes quickly.  Can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"Oh my yummers. This was my first time here, and I will be back. Maybe on a weekly basis. Food here is a little pricier than the average hole-in-the-wall Mexican taco joint, but you can tell that there's quality served here.   Food: Between the three of us, we ordered three burritos, a taco, a gordita, and a Mexican coke. I ordered the carne asada burrito and it was phenomenal. Get some of the sautéed onions that are available on the side counter and add them to the mix. It gives an almost Korean BBQ taste to the burrito. The portions aren't your gigantic Chipotle style sizes, but one was perfect for me.   The tacos looked really good as well, so I'll have to try them next time.   Service: no problems here. You order at the counter and they come and find you.   Seating: lots of seating both inside and out.   Come here. It's in a little sketchy of a neighborhood, but the good ones always are."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the time of day. Maybe their Monday was a meh as mine. Things just seemed lukewarm, precooked and waiting for customers. Of the salsas the only one that really stood out was the bright green one even if it was so thin and watery it was flavorful. The dark green salsa verde was nicely roasted but I can't tell of the flavor and 'sparkle' is that of having beer added to the salsa recipe or fermentation. The red salsa has raw earthiness of the dried red chile, and while it has a medium heat I could have used some more flavor, some garlic, maybe salt, a splash of vinegar maybe?    I ordered 2 tacos de al pastor, one lengua, one tripas, and a rajas gordia. While I did take it to go, I don't live far, and while that can explain some of the food temp and doesn't quite explain why things just seemed dry, sad and waiting for customers.  The gordia was eaten enroute back home. The tacos at home.   In short it was good. Price was not an issue.  I will likely try them again but not rushing back as soon as many other reviewers."}
{"text":"I ordered five tacos from this place and all but one were amazing. The one that wasn't was still very good. The whole drive up to Sedona I kept thinking of these tacos. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Tacos Chiwas is another solid taco joint in the hood!  This place screams homemade authentic awesomeness!!   The tacos were delicious.  The Asada and Pastor were way above average compared to other taco spots near by.  You can tell the meat is cooked right and marinated proper.  No chewy bs here, soft tender cuts of meat that could nearly melt in your mouth.   Now let's get to those homemade, fresh corn tortillas!!  Chiwas hits the grand slam in this department!  They serve the best corn tortillas I've had in recent memory.  So soft and perfect, this is what sets Chiwas apart from the rest.    I was reluctant when I saw the price tag on these tacos ($2.50 each), 3 Pastor and 3 Asada tacos rang up to $16.29.  But with the above average price comes above average taste.    Can't wait to try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"INSANELY AMAZING!! My coworkers have been talking about this place for months now and we decided to go today for lunch. I am so upset with myself on why I did not go sooner. Today I had two carne asada tacos and the spicy gordita (forgot the name). The tacos where topped with pickled onions and plenty of cilantro. I was happy that Tacos Chiawas had their own salsa bar filled with spicy sauces to take your taco to the next level. The gordita was amazing as well. I've never eaten a gordita before and I was happy I took my coworkers advice. This place is truly a mom-n-pop shop who serves delicious food. Everything here was cooked to perfection. I will definitely be coming back and spreading the word of this neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Oh my, these were some of the finest tacos I've ever eaten. We ordered the Pastore, marinated pork in sauce made with authentic Chihuahua chilis and pineapple. Carne Asada, cooked and flavorful flank steak. All tortillas hand made and delicious. I added the sautéed onions with Maggi sauce from sauce bar that are sooooo gooood. The cheese quesadilla melts in your mouth with an extra thin handmade flour tortilla. The gorditas were so tasty, shredded beef with green sauce and potato and beans. True authentic dining experience. This will be a regular stop when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Amazing street tacos. Not too big but oh so tasty. The chiwas, carnitas, and pastor were delicious.Might be my favorite in the valley now!"}
{"text":"The food is fairly good.  We tried barbacoa, asada and chiwas tacos, carnitas, rajas and bean gorditas. The problem here is in the value. Tiny tacos with about 2 oz of meat are $2.50 and gorditas are $3, about 30% overpriced."}
{"text":"I love Tacos Chiwas, so when I heard they were opening a coffee and tamale place nextdoor, I was super excited! They opened recently and I checked them out this morning. The space is cute and the smell of the tamales was mouth watering. I tried their special coffee that's made with cinnamon and piloncillo syrup....It was good, but not what I expected as it isn't milk based....More like cinnamon -y coffee. Anyway, the real stars here are the tamales.... I tried the red chili tamale and it was pretty legit....Also, it was priced at 2.50, which is super cheap compared to most restaurants. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Service is aight! Food was aight! The whole experience was aight! Owner go put some TLC in your joint!!"}
{"text":"Tacos Chiwas is the taqueria you're craving. Legit street style tacos that we need near central Phoenix. They have a wide selection of meats and options, but you know exactly what you're getting. The food was served quickly and was hot when we got it.   The salsa bar doesn't have a crazy selection but has everything that you need. Be careful, if you're not used to spice, stick to the mild.   Definitely a great go to spot for a nice cold horchata with tacos that's also inexpensive."}
{"text":"Believe the hype. This place is fantastic. It's drive past my exit on 51 and keep going until I hit McDowell good. The carne asada is always perfectly done. The calabacitas tacos can convince kids to eat all their veggies."}
{"text":"Yes, you guessed it... Back with another Taco Tuesday experience! Came here with my taco buddy last week due to proximity and the reviews, of course. I ordered the Al Pastor, rajas gordita and their special of the week, which was a vegetarian taco with squash and cheese. I am a really big believer of salsa bars and I was really excited to find one here. We walked over to load up on salsas while we waited for our order. I was slightly disappointed to discover that almost all of them were over the top spicy :( I wish they had a few more options for people who enjoy moderate levels of spice in their food . Even their mild salsa had quite a bit of heat.   I was surprised to find myself liking the vegetarian options a lot more than the Al Pastor. It certainly wasn't bad by any means, but there is really stiff competition around town for these puppies. My friend found this a tad too spicy, but it was within my tolerance level. The vegetarian taco tasted pretty good.. although I wish it had a little more kick to it. I judiciously topped it with the \"mild\" salsa and that added a whole new dimension of flavor. I can safely say that the star of the night was the rajas gordita. It is a beautiful blend of hatch chilies, roasted jalapenos and Mexican cheese. Was it spicy? Yes. Did it pack a ton of flavor? Absolutely! I would definitely order this again.  The restaurant started getting crowded around the 7 o'clock mark and it is clearly, quite popular. And rightfully so. I would put it in the list of \"good tacos in the valley\" without deliberation!"}
{"text":"Had a variety of tacos. Although they were all good $2.50 a small street taco is a little expensive. Will be back to try the gorditas and the burritos.  Asada was tasty and tender, carnitas were so juicy and moist. The Tripitaka were my favorite they were so crispy and food. The salsa bar featured 4 salsas, guacamole, mild green, spicy green guacamole and spicy red. The spicy green was my favorite, unfortunately they cucumbers were all pretty yellow so I didn't get them."}
{"text":"Very Tasty, but overpriced tiny tacos.  Go to Tacos Saguaro instead."}
{"text":"This place is good. I wouldn't rate it outstanding.  The ingredients are fresh, but quiet pricy for street tacos..... $3.00 each is a tad much.  Doesn't sound like much but for what you get when  you order 3 you're over $10.00....not a $15.00 meal with a drink.    The best is the pastor....ild skip the Chiwas it's very salty."}
{"text":"Excellent. Some of the best street tacos I've had north of the border. The charro beans were top notch and reminded me of my nana's recipe. Had the lengua, pastor, asada, and the chiwas and they were all great. The pastor was sublime, and I'm not even a huge fan of pastor in general. Super tender with the right flavor. Winner winner taco dinner."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the AC. Small, dry, one note tacos. Horchata tastes like they added baby powder--come on, anything with added baby powder is rough. Cheesey joke, but something here should be cheesey if they can't get any flavor into the pastor. I just wanted delicious tacos! Why are these $2.50? Why was this Phoenix magazine's Readers Choice best tacos in 2016? Was there a change in ownership? I'm probably more annoyed than I should be... but it's because I threw the dried up, chopped up, unremarkable tacos I paid for away, and hanger is real y'all."}
{"text":"Do not judge this place from the outside appearance. The food is fantastic and has a dive feeling inside but well worth it. My only complaint is if your having a beer you can't take it to the outside tables.  I've been here a couple times now and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The only reason I will be going back is the beans! Everything else was okay but the beans topped it all off! Went there early on a Sunday and it was not very busy. I ordered the Charro beans they tasted freshly made and were just a blast of yumminess in your mouth! Also ordered the carne asada taco and lengua(cow tongue). The tortillas were freshly made and delicious the carne asada was okay and the lengua was missing that authentic lengua flavor did not like it at all."}
{"text":"Now this is a keeper. Lines out the door give you your first clue. I'm a tamale person and these are meaty and tasty. Love the Sedona touch of a salad on top. Inside seating limited. But all worth it"}
{"text":"Wowza.  I don't know how good the tacos were.  I ate several of the carne asada and the carnitas tacos, so I'm sure they were good.  I mainly used the tacos as a means to transport the absolutely amazing condiments to my mouth.  Tacos Chiwas has a large case of different types of salsa and veggies to add to your tacos.  There is a light green salsa that tastes like buttermilk and cilantro.  It's probably not actually made of buttermilk and cilantro, but it's incredible, and I drenched all my food in it.  I also drank it straight from the provided cup and made \"tacos\" out of cucumbers with grilled onions inside and covered in the buttermilk/cilantro sauce.  All in all, this is probably my favorite new taco place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The asada tacos  just don't taste good everything else was fine. Just an expensive taco for beef called asada that is not asada at all but rather looks like shredded beef."}
{"text":"This place is So. Damn. Good. A friend and I went there on a recommendation, and boy, were they right! The place is small and unassuming, but the food doesn't need a big, fancy venue to speak for it! I ordered their signature taco, a carne asada taco and a carnitas taco...all delicious. They also have a really fun selection of Hispanic sodas which are fun to treat yourself to when you're having street tacos! When in Chihuahua, right? The service is also top notch. If you aren't familiar with a dish, they'll walk you through it. Excellent overall."}
{"text":"These are really tasty street tacos. Went with the chicken and was not disappointed. The Gordita was awesome as well...and not in a Taco Bell kinda way.  Always in a search for a great local taco, and this fits the bill!"}
{"text":"That heavenly scent of grilled asada and pork wafting out to greet us for lunch. Yum!!!! The tacos were so perfectly prepared and we loved the accompanying toppings. Fresh cilantro, cucumbers, limes, and salsas. This little place truly works."}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall restaurant with about 8 tables, was told the owner was a former cook at Pizzeria Bianco for many years until he decided to open his own restaurant.   Ordered the Taco Chiwas, Carnitas Tacos, Asada Burrito and the Deshebrada Verde Gordita which were all tasty.  The Tacos Chiwas has Beef, Ham, Cheese, Jalepeno and Hatch Chilis in a street taco size entree which I preferred and would recommend. Not too spicy, but good flavor, if the entree is named after the restaurant it better live up as the premeir dish which it was.  The Carnitas Tacos were good with the shredded pork and flavorful, would like to go back and try a few more of the others like the Asada, Pastor, Chicken or Beef Tongue.  The Asada Burrito was pretty good but the beef was slightly on the over cooked but had a pico sauce with cilantro which gave it a good fresh mix, pretty much all the offerrings of tacos can be found with a burrtio and some more. BTW the tortillas are very good.  The Deshebrada Verde Gordita which is shredded beef in a green sauce was good and in a soft shell, they do offer many other varieties so you can decide which flavor is best for you.  They do offer Breakfast Burritos, Quesidillas and a Bean Soup (Frijoles Charros) along with Horchatta and a Jamaica Drink, but that is for another time.  I ennjoyed their food and will come back to try the other side of the menu."}
{"text":"bean soup- bomb AF. The chiwas taco and the pastor tacos were my favorite. Not the absolute best tacos in Phoenix, but they were good and worth a try."}
