{"text":"Indredients are always fresh - they always have staff in the back preparing more! I was very satisfied with the customer service considering they had a lineup almost to the door! Guacamole is .65 extra but very good with their chips. It looks so hard to roll a burrito with so much inside. Favourite burrito joint."}
{"text":"This place is a disaster. Extremely slow, the ingredients are not fresh and they charge you extra for everything(including grilled vegetables).   Go anywhere else, I recommend pho hung two floors above, delicious Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Came here for take-out lunch today and was pretty happy overall.  The line-up was long but it moved quickly and the service was good (to the point, but efficient).  My spicy chicken burrito was pretty tasty.  The chicken was tender and didn't have any yucky chewy bits.  There was a nice balance of ingredients and things tasted pretty fresh but I resented having to pay extra for guacamole.  I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"Got a small beef steak burrito from here!! I have never tried any of the burrito places so far, in my whole entire life time so I have nothing to compare it with. But it wasn't that great, just taste like home made wrap...!! I probably won't go again but now at least I know how burrito taste like....haha  Ohhh yaa, I think this place should be healthier than other places because the stuff is not oily and seemed pretty fresh!! It's not as small as some people describes, it's pretty big for me... But I was managed to finish it :-)"}
{"text":"I had the small steak burrito with black beans, rice, corn, lettuce, tomatoes, mild salsa sauce and cilantro.   Service was attentive and place has ample seating.  Watch out the guacomole is extra - I went before and wasn't warned but than again it is written on the signage.  No complaints."}
{"text":"This is a fast food chain? I've never heard of it...Good for me!  I was staying at a hotel nearby, and I had a very important social function in the evening, which means I can't eat anything that would compromise my face thinning regiment. Plus I didn't have enough time for a restaurant lunch, so I popped in for a quick bite.  I came here once before, looked at the menu..and walked out. I know Mexican food doesn't mean things in a pita, but that's the only selection here. There were a few things on the menu, but nearly no photos. How am I supposed to order?  Imagine trying to order from Taco Bell with no photos of the food, nobody would know what they were getting!! I got a spicy chipotle chicken with these brown beans, because the Women assembling it behind the counter said it was softer when I ask what the difference was comparing to the black bean. She seemed annoyed. I got the mild sauce, it was green..and too spicy to be called mild. I wanted the small size burrito, and supposedly that's what she gave me, but the thing was enormous! I sat down to eat with the two other people here..both MCAT candidates.  What a depressing atmosphere.  I wasn't treated very well by the two staff members here, they were nonchalant. You can't expect much from this place, but I wasn't happy. It's like customer service you see in that movie 'Clerks.' It took me much too long to finish the burrito, usually this would be a good thing, but it's not this time. Small means small."}
{"text":"I've been a Quesada lover for a few years now and am content with their range of burrito's.  It may not be the best in town, but it's a good quick bite and average value for the money.  The staff never seem to be incredibly happy and they can be stingy with ingredients depending on who the server is.  The restaurant is clean, brightly lit, and has a good atmosphere that I don't mind sitting in."}
{"text":"I like that there is a lower priced choice for food in this area.  It's not gourmet, but it is satisfying.  Given the option between a $5 sub (Mr. Sub, next door) and their $5 limited time offer chicken burrito, it was a no brainer to head straight in.  Service is slow, mainly due to the time needed to heat the burrito on the panini press.  The servers don't often smile and options for the filling are spoken in a clipped, mechanical tone that makes you feel like you're not deciding fast enough.  Maybe it's the nature of fast food, but if McDonald's can deliver with a smile, why can't they?  Come just before noon or not until 1pm for lunch if you don't feel like waiting in line.  The food is sitting like a yummy brick in my stomach right now.  At least I can trick myself into believing that it's a small bit healthier than processed deli or a big mac.  There is the option to combo the burrito up with a drink and tortilla chips with salsa, though I really don't think the combo is really quite worth it.  Then again, I'm a fairly light eater."}
{"text":"Not as good as burrito boys (can't put my finger on why) but not terrible. It's a good choice if you're choosing between McD's for a quick meal.  They have plenty of choice, from steak, pork to veggies. They could fill up the burritto with more stuffing and find they are sparse. I pay $0.65 for extra guac and I got barely a teaspoon.  Taste is good, except that my beans are all in one place (as opposed to spread out)."}
{"text":"I am really surprised by the reviews being soooo low. I have been to Quesada several times and have felt filled and satisfied by the experience. I mean for the area it is really hard to have inexpensive cuisine unless you buy something at a hot dog stand outside (or McDonalds -though do you really want to support them?!?). Also, I personally like that you can add salsa and chips to make it a combo. It is more tex-mex than Mexican....and if you like that style - Quesada delivers but at the cost of being located in Yorkville."}
{"text":"Yup. It's a burrito: stuff in a tortilla, wrapped up and pressed in a panini press. It's not blow-your-mind-good, but it's also better than a sharp stick in the eye. The best thing about Quesada is that it's within a quick walk from the Rotman School at U of T -- very convenient when you have a little extra time between activities and you don't want to eat any of the swill on campus. Biggest con, however: SKIMPY ON THE FILLINGS. Anorexia is for models, not burritos!"}
{"text":"The first time I went it was ok. The burrito wasn't all that good. But it was definitely a burrito...  On repeated visits I've realized just how slow they are. If you're not 1st or 2nd in line, you'll be waiting, and waiting, and waiting.  It's not a good burrito. Definitely below average for Toronto. So if I'm going, I expect it to at least be fast. But it's not.  I'm resigned to never going there again. Sad really, because I love burritos and this place is so close to my house."}
{"text":"I am taking the ranking process of Sarah L for this one!  They didn't have medium salsa. They were miserable with their attitudes. It was painful for me to want to eat afterwards.   The burrito isn't that good to go through that experience. I had to repeat myself 3 times that I was taking it out.   What happened to a \"thank you?\"   Nightmare.."}
{"text":"Not terrible in my experience, but too expensive for the quality, service, and selection.  This place is all quantity.  I was with somebody who wanted to feed and he was thinking maybe McDonalds and he gave me the option and I decided here because I figured they had Jarritos juice/soda and they did...including my favored lime flavor (almost as good as their guava).  Viva run-on sentences!  Next time I would just flip a coin between here and McDonalds and that's a pretty good indicator of what you can expect here."}
{"text":"This place gave me food poisoning. I had a small steak burrito with black beans, lettuce, cheese, tomato, salsa, guacamole, sour cream.  Either the food was expired or there was someone who wasn't washing their hands. Or the place just isn't as clean as I thought it was.  My stomach ballooned right after I ate there, to a really scary size. After many hours of getting sick, I ended up going to the hospital that night.  Never going here again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here on the regular for the past 8 months or so.  It is the only rewards card I carry in my wallet.  I like it here.  They don't really give you enough salsa when you order the chips, the food sometimes doesn't look the freshest, sometimes the burritos are put together very sloppily, and the line-ups can get pretty long sometimes.  Those are really my only gripes about the place.  The food and portions are usually pretty good and filling, the service moves at a steady pace like an assembly line, and the rewards card is a good incentive to keep going."}
