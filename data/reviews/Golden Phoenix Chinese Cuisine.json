{"text":"Three stars perfectly sums this place up... nothing memorable, but nothing bad either.  The atmosphere is surprisingly nice (very clean- always a plus) and the service is friendly.  Americanized Chinese with all the usual suspects on the menu.  General Tso's shrimp were okay but lacking in flavor, same goes for the soup and other dishes I tried.  Decent prices and food for a neighborhood joint, but I'd head to Chinatown for more authentic and flavorful Chinese.  I would not come back, but that is mostly because I live on the exact opposite end of town."}
{"text":"house chow mein is amazing...they cook to order ..."}
{"text":"As the other review states, yes, this is \"one of those strip mall Chinese restaurants\".  What else to you expect when you go to a strip mall for Chinese food?  My husband and I have been eating at this restaurant for the past 6 months.  We love the food.  The style has never changed, nor have the prices.  The service has always been friendly.  I've never had any food under or overcooked.  This is a \"hidden gem\" in this area.  I recommend this restaurant to anyone that wants a quality American-Chinese style meal."}
{"text":"Stayed on my mom's side of town and had a hankereing for chinese food. Overall, my experience was average. Favorites included war won ton soup and shrimp fried rice. Items to miss were the too oily chicken chow mein, and the vegetable curry, which was absolutely awful."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy...just your average Panda Express type of Chinese. I've been there a couple of times this year.  Went there since I was dying for some Chinese take out but too lazy for the 30 min drive to Chinatown.  By the way, this place was just featured in Dirty Dining on 5/24/17.  So watch out!  http://www.ktnv.com/news/dirty-dining/dirty-dining-golden-phoenix-albertsons-great-buns-and-more"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and I must say my experience was great. They did advise me that it would be 45min-1hour for my food to arrive but I expected it especially cause I had a big order. When my food did arrive it was still hot and tasted great and fresh. I was also surprised and happy that I was given one free entree of choice because I had placed a big order yayyyy. I would definitely order from here again. Thanks for the great service"}
{"text":"Quick service, staff is nice and courteous. The donuts are on point and the food is great as well."}
{"text":"Please post pics if you order from Golden Phoenix!! I like to know how the food is made before ordering.  The only Chinese place we go to. Not the best ever to my taste but service is great and food is decent. I've only tried 6 things here. Afraid to try anything else because I wasn't too pleased with two of them... And don't want to waste. I like the pork fried rice and Mongolian beef here. I've also ordered to go, the wor wonton soup. The contents are packed in. I'm not too crazy for the wontons. Just the veggies and soup base. Also, the crab wontons weren't the best I've ever had, but I can still enjoy it.  I'll try to remember posting pics in the future!!"}
{"text":"I had gone to eat here sunday for Lunch with the hubby and had gotten the lunch portion which was way cheap for the food you get! Soup, fried rice, chow mein, egg roll, and the entree!! I think our bill was $12 including tip! :) It was definitley worth going for lunch!   We have always ordered dinner from them to go but wow the lunch specials are amazing!"}
{"text":"Sorry but this was a huge disappointment . Mongolian beef looked amazing tasted like microwaved rubbery beef. Fried rice tasted like Thai fried rice & microwaved not wok'd fresh-chicken in house f.rice boiled & rubbery.. Middle aged man took our order - we ordered 2 types of fried rice & only got 1. We did take out took 10min- wish we drove 10 min in another direction."}
{"text":"I was desperate and didn't want to go all the way to Spring Mountain, so I decided to try this place since it was down the street.  I knew what I was getting myself into.  I knew this was one of those \"Chinese\" places you find in every third strip mall you pass by, that has a largely non-Chinese clientele, and serves the obligatory fried wontons, spring rolls, egg flower soup, mongolian beef, and fortune cookies.  I knew this place wouldn't have a menu written in Chinese.  I knew all of this, so why-oh-why did I decided to eat here LOL?  I guess I was hoping to discover a hidden gem with a glimmer of authenticity closer to where I live.  Hey, it just might happen! :)   I guess I just didn't want to deal with driving on the 15 to get to Spring Mountain.  I had the Honey Glazed Walnut Shrimp (shrimp were overcooked and walnuts were stale), Braised Bean Curd with Brown Sauce (not salty enough, and they only gave me 2 mushrooms), Lovers Shrimp (the spicy one was flavorless and too sweet), and I asked if they could make salt/pepper pork chops, and they did, but a few pieces of the pork were undercooked and I didn't feel like getting trichinosis that day, so I just left that one alone.  Because the food was icky and because they tried to almost kill me, no way am I going back LOL!  :)"}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese food places I have found in Vegas. My family and I eat here a few times a week and we always get awesome, hot and fresh food. Customer service is always on point as well."}
{"text":"Okay so the reviews for this restaurant are somewhat okay but unfortunately skin color plays a huge role in eating at this restaurant. Many of brown skinned  melanated people (black/Negros)may not see it. Luckily I seen it this time. My husband and I always go out as a family because we experience much prejudice due to our skin color. We get that , and realize we must carry own with our lives the best way possible. So the family image is what we stick to while on the go it helps reduce the racisim we face while out and about. On the topic of this restaurant my husband was surprised that I picked up on the man at the front register's racism. Yes! a Living in a dream world San Diego Native eyes and ears finally seen and heard racism. The man at the front insisted that we took our food to go as soon as we walked through the door.  Once my husband asked me if I would like to dine in or take it to go he practically insisted that we took it to go. It blew me away. I asked the man. If he wanted us to leave and he changed his tune by stating you can eat here or leave it doesn't matter with an evil look and an I got  caught and y'all called me out on it expression followed with a laugh. So long story short we asked for a refund and explained to him how he made us feel. He told us that the food was already done but I believe that only a complete fool would still eat that food after his unbelievable behavior. Let me be honest, unfortunately this review probably will not matter anyway, and this place will continue to get business from every racial background, but for anyone who cares and is concerned about the racial climate in restaurants that you choose to eat at you have been warned!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and big portions. If you eat in expect slow and very poor service.  We eat once in awhile due to there service. But get take out mostly because of the service."}
{"text":"****EATER BE WARNED*****Bought the lemon chicken to go,i took couple bites i noticed the chicken was chewy, opened the other pieces of chicken sure enough the F in chicken was raw, half cooked, not cooked what ever you want to call it, it was like eating fricken rubber. So i paid $9 to eat rubber shit, id rather eat Dog food instead of eating that raw crap. Instead of serving a fully cooked dish they would rather rush it and give you raw shit food and still make you pay $9 for it, PISSES off the most is that i was going to serve that to my kids, and for the cooks to give me that shit to give to my family.!^#*!_รท You should be fired. This place should lose demerits. I work on the line and have a passion for Food, i would rather have the customers wait for food that is COOKED fully then to rush the dish and give the customers Raw Food, Leave  Cooking to the Cooks that really care about what they Do and Put Out, if they dont care about the food they probably dont care about the kitchen or proper food handling.             **Just go to Jack in the Box** ............DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY....."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend eating here even if you were starving for 3 days. Food is mediocre and the service is horrendous. I will not be coming back, not even for water."}
{"text":"Ordered wontons and got 10 crab rangoons instead. Their singapore noodle is yummy it isn't overly spicy which I like."}
{"text":"We've ordered to go from here 3 or 4 times now and the food has always been great! So far we've had the lemon chicken (they put the sauce on the side for to go so its not all soggy!), Mongolian beef, cashew chicken, and the wonton soup (yum). Haven't been dissatisfied yet. They have great lunch specials also."}
{"text":"Very good & fast. I have only ordered for pickup and delivery and both times they were right on time with my order the food was very neat and clean. And very very good. This is definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants that I've experienced."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, I had some orange chicken and it was delicious, the barbeque pork rice is good, the hot and sour soup not so much (but I'm not really a soup person anyways). Service was great, food was ready quickly and the prices are decent. This was my first time here and it won't be my last."}
{"text":"It is the weirdest food ive ever gotten.  The so called \"chicken\" tasted weird and rubbery. I've never had such weird meat in a dish EVER!  I tried to think of if it was microwaved but while it had that texture I know what chicken tastes like. I've had nuggets in a bag before and you know it's normal chicken and maybe slightly Rubbery but it tastes real. DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING WITH THE CHICKEN."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food in Vegas. Went here and had some really good broccoli beef. Fried rice was also very good and Kung pow chicken was on point. My only gripe is that service was a bit long. But in the end it was worth it. It seemed that everybody orders here to go...not sure why nobody dines in. I think I'll try that next weekend. Definitely going back!  -Joe"}
{"text":"Do you like half-baked chinese food? Well, step right up! The golden phoenix is for you! With cuisine that rivals only the cheapest buffets the Golden Phoenix will cause you to have bowel cancer later in life. Processed meats, frozen, then microwaved are complimented by watered down sauces. Yum! Don't worry about the extra calories from the fried rice, because you wont want to eat that anyway. The entire meal is shrouded in mystery on which dish will come to which patron as you will probably have the wrong order put in front of you."}
{"text":"Not authentic Chinese food whatsoever. Sauces were watered down, soupy, just not good. Place was pretty much deserted too. Service was typical but we got the rest to go and were handed boxes. I've never had to fill my own Togo boxes at a Chinese restaurant before ever. There are no good Chinese restaurants in North Las Vegas, what a shame. Even Panda Express is better than these places."}
{"text":"Place sucks! Food tastes over fried, They overcharged my total over $20. Not a trusted store. Would recommend to those who enjoy being scammed! Ha!"}
{"text":"we ordered hot & sour soup  which was good. house chow fun which was average,  but the low rating is mostly because  of the horrid egg foo young.  instead  of the normal egg, bean sprout patty w/ meat choice with gravy on top, this was an undistinguishable mixture  of god knows what. horrible. egg patty  had no sprouts,  meat was in the sauce & the patty itself was indistinguishable.  absolutley  one of the worst dishes i have ever ordered. the hot mustard  & sweet & sour sauces were both horrible as well. $33 worth of disappointment."}
{"text":"today was the first time I tried this place with my friend. It was great! food was yummy and lunch specials are awesome! I got the chicken with broccoli with iced tea. It included fried pork rice, noodles, and and egg roll. They also give you an appetizer and your choice of soup! My bill came out to around $8! pretty sweet!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today with my Mom. It was yummy! Nice atmosphere and really good food. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"So it's officially my second time ordering on delivery the service is quick the food was correct everything was good and fast what more can you ask for"}
{"text":"A group of 19 of us went here Sunday evening for a birthday dinner. 11 of us got food poisoning. Not a very good birthday present. Needless to say, we called the health department. They are going to be paying them a visit."}
{"text":"A good Chinese Restaurant. I do not see many people in there if you intend to Dine in. I hear most of their customers order online which I sometimes do too.   I have tried out quite a few dishes, and all of them have been excellent. Price is also very fair and meals are delicious!  Try it out, you will not regret if you are into Chinese food."}
{"text":"I was craving Hot & Sour Soup so I stopped by to pick up an order to go. I got home and opened it and right away I could smell that it had too much soy sauce in it. The color was also darker than it should be because of the soy sauce.   The gentleman working at the counter was nice. There was also a fortune cookie and some fried wonton skins.  Walking into the place I knew I was most likely going to be disappointed...but I had a craving, so I had to give it a shot."}
{"text":"Food was fresh enough, but couldn't find a trace of actual flavor anywhere... Highlight of the meal was the Coke, with the egg drop soup coming in 2nd place... And that was only after I doctored it up a bit.  Hubby had hot & sour soup, a double lie.  Potstickers were huge & cooked perfect, but no flavor to them nor in the dipping sauce (tasted like watered down soy only).  Hubby's General Tso's Chicken was very bland, and the chicken was very dry. My Chicken Chow Mein (soft noodles) was also very bland, but at least the chicken was moist.  I boxed mine to take home for doctoring up, but his food was left behind to be tossed out.  All in all, a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and I ordered \"spicy\" pork chops... Absolutely the worst thing I've ever had... First off it's not pork chops it's fried chucks of pork... My first bite was extremely chewy and some of it was too hard to chew... There's no sauce on it at all... So it's not spicy at all... So I added sauce of my own to it... But I'm eating and bite right into a bone... Yes a bone! I call them and tell them all these things I'm unhappy with and she had many excuses. Like its salt and pepper pork chops and that's how they come as chucks instead of an actual piece of a pork chop. She said yea there's bones in it! What?? Why these are chucks like bite size pieces why would I have to eat around bones? That's strange and I almost broke a tooth, after a few minutes of arguing she's sending me something else but requested the pork chops back which is fine because it's not edible. Only got a 2 because they are actually sending me something else."}
{"text":"We consistently order from Golden Phoenix. The food has always been tasty with generous portions.  I do have a problem with their website with inaccuracies, however. Several months ago I advised them the quantity listed on the beef skewers was incorrect and needed to be changed. It wasn't changed. In addition, two free egg rolls are offered with a $15 purchase if checked in. We were advised today that they no longer honor this promotion but it remains on the website. Please correct or honor your advertisements. Thank you!   I"}
{"text":"Great chinese food. I went here for my lunch break yesterday and was impressed with their lunch special.   Food: I had the General Tso's chicken special. It comes with char sui fried rice, vegetable chow mein, either crab rangoon or an eggroll, hot and sour or egg drop soup, and the entree. The entree as well as the dish were freshly prepared. It wasn't oily or overly salty. They even garnished my dish with broccoli.   Service: The food was prepared within 10 minutes of ordering, and the staff was really friendly.   Price: Great value for under $7. I was surprised it came with so much. I ate half of it and had to eat the other half later since there was so much.   Misc: Its in a Smith's shopping plaza, but its kinda quiet inside. Delivery can take long since there is only one driver, but it'll be worth the short wait."}
{"text":"Tasty food, quick service and cheap. Knocked 1 star off because I asked the waitress if the Sesame Chicken was all white meat and she answered yes. When I got my food...ALAS! Dark meat mixed (side eye). I prefer white meat and would have paid extra if needed. Would return but won't order the same thing. Awesome Wonton soup!"}
{"text":"Average, average, and average! They're prices are fair and they have military discount, but otherwise these guys are a last resort kind of place in the neighborhood.  Their chow mein was OK, and their Thai Tea was OK too.    Enough said...."}
{"text":"Typical American-Chinese restaurant right down to the \"very spicy\" packets of hot mustard and sirracha...  They also serve \"Thai Food\", but they do not have the pickled peppers, dry chili, and wet chili authentic Thai restaurants serve with the meal.  I ordered spring rolls, Mongolian Beef, and Szechuan Eggplant. Total price was just under $25.  The spring rolls were crispy on the outside and inside was a vegetable \"mush blend\". I'm not sure what company makes these spring rolls or why every chinese restaurant seems to buy them, but I wish they would stop. My wife likes them btw... go figure.  Mongolian Beef was good. The beef was tender and tasted good. There were only a few pieces of bell pepper, which was a little dissapointing. If I ordered it again, I would ask them only add 1/4 their normal amount of onions and add more bell pepper.  Szechuan Eggplant was very good. It was not overcooked into a mushy mess like most restaurants serve. The bamboo shoots were an odd paring for the dish, but I just picked them out.  Not great, not bad... just average."}
{"text":"I've found my new favorite Chinese food place!!! Decided to do a take out and they were pretty quick with my order (10-15 mins). Also took advantage of their egg roll deal on yelp and it's ok, but I'm not big on egg rolls. Ordered the beef chow mein and shrimp fried rice, which both are really big portions and delicious, so definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"Golden Phoenix Chinese Cuisine  I have recently moved to this area and as a result my wife and I are scoping out the local eateries looking for our new mainstays. Golden Phoenix is very conveniently located for us, but that is about all it is.  Like many quickly opened Asian Cuisine places, this restaurant has absolutely no atmosphere. Aside from a few flat screens and some kitsch Asian lamps there is nothing to distinguish this hole in the wall. Service is cold and the server kept repeating \"relax, take your time\" which would be fine if not for the fact that I felt she wanted us as window dressing telling the public, \"look, we got some suckers in here, please be a sucker and come in here too.\"  \"We use Vegetable Oil\" is the quip on their menus. I like the fact that lard and MSG are left out of their food prep, you would think that their cuisine would have a lighter touch, but this is far from true. I ordered the Beef and Broccoli and my wife ordered the Cashew Chicken. The B&B was so heavy that I simply could not eat it. The beef was tender and the broccoli was crisp but it was drowned in a soy sauce so oily and heavy I simply could not eat it. My wife's Cashew Chicken was prepared similarly without a single Cashew in sight, just a thick stomach churning soy sauce.  The sides were not any better. The noodles were also heavy but better than the main course and likely reheated (which may have been what saved it.) The Fried Rice was also over seasoned and also tasted and felt reheated and again, this actually made it edible since the oil was not as prevalent. I did not even finish my egg roll, nuff said. The only thing that was good was the Egg Drop Soup. The soup had a nice light taste and velvety mouth feel and was a delight. It was too bad the rest of the food lacked the same finesse.  Sad to say I will likely not be returning to Golden Phoenix; for me there are only ashes there."}
{"text":"Yum good food here . I loved the place , nice clean and welcoming ! Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Their service is always quick and I haven't had anything I didn't like here. While they do offer delivery I highly recommend going in. They always offer more rice, are super quick to refill drinks, and are overall very attentive. I love their crab ragoons and spring rolls and recommend both. To another point their portion sizes are huge! I can easily make two full meals out of a dinner from here. Good little place!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this is only 3 stars. We get take-out from here regularly.  The prices are really good and the portions are big.  We like their chicken pad Thai special.  It's so flavorful and the chicken is so tender. It never disappoints.  Fried wonton appetizer is a must. Wontons filled with cream cheese and scallion fried to perfection. I love the Happy Family, Dragon & Phoenix (sauce on the side or it's mushy the next day), General Tso's shrimp.  We've never had a bad dish.  Hubby is a fan of the Mongolian beef. It's the only thing he gets EVERY time.  Worth the try in our opinion!"}
{"text":"Ordered crab Rangoon and almond chicken.... Crab Ragoon was good but chicken did not look like chicken or was very undercooked!  Whole entree seemed covered in a slime that was not appealing. I threw it away!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times usually take out.  Always had very good service and great food.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered delivery from here and the amount of thing that were wrong was kinda sad. She ordered steamed rice and got fried. My curry beef tasted really off, like bad beef off. My roommate tried it, not even knowing what it was supposed to taste like, and decided that it tasted expired. She also found a rock in her orange chicken? Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Usually the food is good. Fast delivery and the orders are usually correct. How we after seeing this restaurant in Dirty Dining we will not be ordering from here anymore. Cockroaches, flies in the prep area, meats with no dates, chicken and beef stored over eggs, disgusting cooler. They received a \"C\" health code rating that they is supposed to be displayed yet it was covered up."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another chance, this time we dined in. Service was a little slow, hostess was also waitress, server and bus person.  We ordered the Beef Chow Mein, Kung Pao beef, Honey Chicken, Pot stickers, Crab Rangoon and a cup of Hot and Sour soup. I'm glad we gave this restaurant another shot. The food was excellent and everything was delicious. My last review was hasty solely based on one item, and for that I regret posting it. I retract my negative review whole heartedly, offer this restaurant my sincere apologies, and say that I highly recommend it. I will be back to dine again with my family. The Honey Chicken was so delicious, they use white meat chicken breast, crispy, sweet, and very delicious, the Kung Pao beef was spicy and savory, Chow Mein was also very delicious and savory. Pot Stickers were excellent, great flavor and the dipping sauce was perfect. Last but not least, the Crab Rangoon were crispy and delicious, the sweet and sour dipping sauce made them even better. We paid a little over $60 including tip for four of us, pretty fair in my opinion, also had a beer. We were all satisfied and smiling at meals end.  Thank you Golden Phoenix, we shall be back."}
{"text":"I would always eat at this restaurant very great food but I have recently discovered they have a roach problem.  It seems like the problem has been addressed before but the owners seems to like the way his business is running so I have decided to place my findings here to warn other people eating..  Don't really care if you take my advice or not just be careful here"}
{"text":"We just gave this place a try. All 4 of us loved it. Everything tasted great and the prices are very reasonable.  Kids  asked us when we could go back.  \"Soon\""}
{"text":"We ordered this food for our work. All of the food tasted sickly. As in as you eat it you feel yourself getting sick. Nobody could finish the food and we all threw it away. Two of my coworkers are already in the bathroom. Very gross food."}
{"text":"Just gross!! Got a To go order of 1 chicken teriyaki bowl and a beef bowl. When we got home I notice that my chicken bowl tasted fishy. Like if it was cooked with fish. I had my husband check it and he said it's chicken just for some reason it's fishy. After 2 bites I threw it away. Husband tries his beef teriyaki bowl and same thing. It was disgusting. We both threw the food away. Never again!!"}
{"text":"Was very nice food good although lots of salt in we think the fried rice egg roll was good but not as good as what we would get in Illinois  These are very thin not much filling  We will try again  Wonton soup as the best we have had here"}
{"text":"If I can rate -5 I would! This store sucks balls, it's not even authentic \"Chinese food\" when I ordered a teriyaki chicken lunch special, I could've sworn it had dog inside it! Will never go back! Must be inspected throughly! Very sad place! Hide your kids from it"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Chinese places in Vegas. The food is consistently good and the service is great, dine-in or take out. The price is reasonable and the portions are quite generous."}
{"text":"More of a 3.5, but i'll give it a 4 cuz I love chinese food. Ate here a few times, but we always take-out since we prefer eating at home. Their almond chicken isn't that great, but the sesame chicken was delicious. My hubs orders beef fried rice quite a few times and he likes it. He says it reminds him of the chinese place he used to order take out alot from when he was in Germany, which is a good thing. It only takes 10-15 mins for the food to be ready, so its always convenient. I usually call ahead to make an order and leave right afterwards, by the time i get there, its all ready :)"}
{"text":"This is the second time since moving here that we have tried this place and it was even worse the second time. Food is dry and bland, rice wasn't cooked all the, chow main was chewy and the food was luke warm. I would definitely pay a little more and go elseware!    I gave it 2 stars because the delivery was quick."}
{"text":"While it's not the best it is good Chinese food and at a good value.  Order ahead, and be sure to try the crab rangoon."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent for a neighborhood joint. Service is friendly,and they are pretty busy, even with pick up orders. Orange chicken is super good."}
{"text":"Oh, my gosh!! Stick a fork in me.  Wrap it up.  Call it in.  It's a wrap.  Yes lawd! This place is definitely in the running to be the new top spot! I ordered wonton soup.  Just a cup was barely 3$ yes!!! But to the business.. the flavor was amazing.  They hit all the right notes, piping hot, plenty of wontons, nice amount of pork, and the vegetables were plentiful ok!! Best part of all the broth was take a bath in it with a straw worthy.  Go get you a taste because it was actually life changing. .. and trust im a tough cookie to please.  Check my reviews okaaaaaay!"}
{"text":"Just moved to a new home and was craving good Chinese food. Found this place on line and ordered for delivery. Food is delicious and the delivery was here 30 minutes after ordering!! So fast and the driver was so friendly!! Love love love it! This is my new restaurant!"}
{"text":"I would have given this a 5 if our perfect meal wasn't ruined by a smoking emoloyee right outside the front door!"}
{"text":"Wow! This is the worst Chinese food I have ever had!! Not much more needs to be said then that! I highly recommend not ordering food from this place!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of cheap Chinese food and this place is super reasonable.  I usually get the chicken with broccoli or the chicken chow mein.  I absolutely can't go without the crab rangoons, which are a little expensive but worth it.  Usually when I have dined in there have been no other families dining, therefore the waiter is extremely attentive to the point of annoying.  Usually you would want a waiter to be attentive, but we could barely have a conversation because we were interrupted so many times.  I would recommend getting take out and bringing it home.  You can even order online, which makes things super easy."}
{"text":"Went for lunch the first meal came out after 10 minutes the next meal came out 15 minutes later. The chicken was lukewarm and after eating some it just didn't taste right. Nasty burps for a couple hours followed by bubble gut trips to the rest room. Will never eat there again. My co worker went home early with stomach cramps. Will never walk in the door again."}
{"text":"Highly recommend if you're looking for flavorful food and great service. Staff is prompt which ensures your wait time is minimal. Portions are more than sufficient, especially for the price you pay. Definitely a must go to place!"}
{"text":"I will never buy from them again, my friend shrimp was hard, the fried chicken was awful and I was raised on it, not good"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant in a grocery store strip mall. It's quick, it's decent, and it's cheap. I came here with a friend around 8 PM on a Wednesday and we each ordered a dinner special-- Cashew Chicken and Beef with Broccoli. The service was on point, quick, and attentive. We had our food in less than 10 minutes. And we were opening up fortune cookies and paying for our meal 10 minutes after that. I love places that don't drag on the experience any longer than it has to be. Don't expect anything fancy. This is quick eats at a relatively low price point."}
{"text":"THE BEST EGGROLLS.  Not much else was particularly fancy or different for me, the lo mein is kind of stringy/wet but I guess i prefer the drier panda express style. But the eggrolls are great! Dare I say the best I've ever had. They have a wide delivery radius for only a $2 delivery fee on a min. $15 order, which I don't know how they maintain that... seems impossible to maintain, too low, but we reap the benefits I guess !"}
{"text":"Delivery was on time and the food was definitely fresh. We ordered sesame chicken, honey chicken, general Yao's chicken (mild), sweet and sour chicken, and crab Rangoon. I didn't eat any of the sesame chicken but my husband wouldn't eat it. The general Yao's and sweet and sour were fresh and hot, they were fried the appropriate amount so it was crunchy on the outside but still tender and juicy on the inside. The general tso's has no flavor except for a little spice from the peppers. The sweet and sour had the sauce on the side which was good because I didn't like the sauce at all, it was neither sweet nor sour and had an almost cinnamon like flavor. The crab Rangoon had a flour taste to the shell but the filling was ok. Overall I wouldn't recommend it and I won't be trying it again."}
{"text":"Probably the best in the area that delivers with only a two dollar charge. Any how we tried there house fried rice. Veggie soup, and Mongolian beef . Orange chicken is good as well. There tie-tea super good. Customer service is great I don't have anything negative about this place and we have been there at least 5 times"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Nothing exciting. Panda express-y tasting. Crab rangoons had NO crab, just cream cheese. $13 for one person for lunch."}
{"text":"We had dinner take out from this restaurant. The person who took our orders was very friendly. It took 15 min for the order to be ready, which is reasonable. The food was pretty good. I had curry chicken with rice and my husband had the three meet dish, with beef, chicken, and shrimp. It was pretty good, too.  I give this restaurant 3 stars, because I don't have anything to complain about and the food was good. Also, I haven't eaten inside the restaurant yet and will definitely write another review if I do.  Dec. 6th  Time to update this review and to write about my second experience with Golden Phoenix:   Last night, my husband and I were craving Chinese food again but didn't feel like driving too far. Since we had a good first experience with this restaurant, we thought we would give it another shot.   I have to say, this was a quite entertaining experience. I honestly would give this restaurant 4 stars for the food. The quality of the food is very good and everything tastes super fresh BUT the service deserves a minus 6 starts.   First of all our server knew little English. When we ordered our food, he would just stand there and stare at us. We repeated our order 3 times and still he brought us somebody else's food. He did not check on us once to ask if we needed anything else. My husband had to stand up a couple of times to go ask for hot sauce or to go ask for the check etc.   At the end we left this place with 6 to go boxes, because they kept messing up the orders and we also got some extra fried rice with shrimp that we hadn't ordered.   Luckily I wasn't upset about it at all, because we ended up leaving the place with a lot of food and got also military discount on our original order.   Abstract:  Food fantastic, service catastrophic!!"}

{"text":"I became very sick after eating here in North las vegas,  centennial pkwy.  So glad dirty dinning got them."}
{"text":"Friendly staff with quick service, I had the Mongolian beef which was excellent. I will definitelybe back"}
{"text":"The customer service here is so very lovely. The food is not amazing, but with the service and the decent prices, it makes it worth coming back every once in a while. I've enjoyed all of my visits here so far, and have tried a few different dishes. The staff is very accommodating when it comes to my dislike of pork."}
{"text":"Food is excellent and so are the prices. It's almost always quiet and the staff is great. I wish we lived closer to it."}
{"text":"I work across the street from this restaurant and decided to give it another try after a not-so-hotso experience a year ago.  Needless to say, my expectations were already low.  So here is my two-cent opinion:  for $5.00....get over yourself.  Yes, the older gentleman at the register wasn't the friendly host I've ever encountered.  Yes, my server was quirky and forgetful.  And yes, I've had better Chinese food down on Spring Mountain.  But......I had 30 minutes to grab a sit-down meal and got it in 20.  I decided to smile at the guy behind the register and in return I was rewarded with a big goofy grin that made me giggle.  And my eccentric server went the extra mile to box up my food for me along with an extra side of soup because she knew I liked it.  All that for $6.00.  I gave them $10.  Have a nice day and I will be back."}
{"text":"By far the worst chinese we've had n believe me we have been to many! Lemon chicken was rubber basically fighting with every bite.. Never seen roastduck burnt drinks tasted like chlorine ... First n last! Never again!"}
{"text":"the food is always very good fresh and hot, service is so nice and prompt, and i do love the food very much i order frequently and its always good"}
{"text":"Simple Chinese food. Lunch specials are awesome and they give perfect portions at a great price. Staff was nice. If your looking for something quick and easy this is the place."}
{"text":"Quality has really gone down in the recent years.  Nothing is Great! It's decent.  Last resort kinda place when I want delivery. :/"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Chinese restaurant in town.  Very impressively large menu at great prices!  Everything was excellent!  Great service."}
{"text":"A good place to go if you're on a budget, but want some great Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap food that comes in generous portions, Golden Phoenix may be what you're looking for, especially if you're in North Las Vegas near Losee and 215.  They offer lunch specials from 11:00am - 4:00pm ranging from $4.50 to $6.75.  The lunch menu is extensive, with meals sorted by beef, chicken, seafood, veggie, etc.  Lunch meals come with fried wonton strips, and egg roll and either egg drop or hot & sour soup.  Unfortunately, it seems like all the food here gets its flavors by being heavily drenched in sauce.  The beef and chicken seem to have no flavor at all when eaten on its own.  The trend here is quantity over quality, so if that is what you're in need of, you won't be disappointed here.  Otherwise, it may be worth your while to skip Au PHX and seek out a nearby PX (http://www.yelp.com/biz/panda-express-las-vegas-18#hrid:x-Dbm3OICWzgfCRaX4kmyA)."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with family on a Sunday afternoon. Once we walked in we were sat down at a table immediately. Right away they kindly asked for our drinks and gave us complimentary chips and sweet and sour dip.  Menus were easy to read and they offer really cheap lunch specials. Lunch specials consist of their house soup and entry. I chose their egg drop soup and Mongolian beef.  Food came out pretty quick. The egg drop soup was delicious. I really enjoyed all the egg that was in the soup. The Mongolian beef entry came out surprisedly very generous. It came with some noodles, fried rice, egg roll and a decent amount portion of Mongolian beef.  Overall experience I am very happy. Our server kept refilling out drinks and taking away our dirty dishes. The amount and quality of food was spectacular and will definitely come back.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Never again! Noodles were good, but that about it. The rest of it was barely okay.  And it took way too long to get change since we paid cash. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Amazing tofu and fried rice. Affordable prices and they deliver super quick (and your food will be fresh and hot!). Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars. The service is relatively fast and the food might not be gourmet but I have to say that it's one the tastiest Chinese food places in N. Las Vegas.   I like the fact that the place is clean, and their Menu has a wide variety of options to choose from.  This is my second review on this place, and over all I have to say that at least they are consistent on the food and service.   Nevertheless nothing has changed much but still a nice place to get good Chinese take out."}
{"text":"The food here is always so tasty! It's the best Chinese I've had in Las Vegas. Sometimes a little slow due to shortage of personnel but the food is worth the wait. Honey walnut shrimp!!!"}
{"text":"I had the dinner combination from this place... Not the best i have had, but it was satisfying...  I have tried the mongolian beef, the pad thai, the sweet and sour pork, general tso chicken and the sesame chicken wings... I will eat here again..."}
{"text":"This place was trash!!!! The sweet and sour pork was awful!! I had to spit it out on a napkin! I thought maybe it was just a bad piece and decided to just try another, same outcome. The house fried rice was just so/so. Service was terrible, the Chinese lady w the short hair runs around like a chicken w their head cut off. They had the audacity to charge me for my sprite and when I asked for my money back for the sweet and sour pork she took the difference out of there. I won't be coming back here at all. I had to get up twice to get something myself instead of waiting. Very dissatisfied. I recommend Panda Express instead at least they're consistent!"}
{"text":"The food was bland. The vegetables could have been cooked down more as they were pretty raw and he shrimp didn't have much flavor. The sauce was also lacking in flavor so you couldn't use that to mask the lack of flavor."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick bite on Saturday with my husband, who has been CRAVING Chinese food for weeks.    The place was clean, although it did smell a little bit like eggs when we walked in.    Service was super polite, and very fast.   Golden Phoenix has some pretty great lunch specials.  We both got a lunch special, and had plenty of food to take home.   We ordered the Kung Pow triple...something...dish. (It was my husbands, with beef, chicken and shrimp), which was good.  Not too spicy.  LOTS of shrimp! I ordered the Buddha's Delight, which is all of the veggies.  Delicious.  Everything was flavorful, and cooked well. Lunch specials are served with fried rice, noodles, and an appetizer (one eggroll), and soup.   I'm not a fan of egg drop, but my husband absolutely loved it.  He ate both bowls.    The eggrolls were good.  More spring roll like, but they were crunchy, and not mushy inside, which is a nice change.    Its too far for delivery, I believe, but I definitely plan to return soon."}
{"text":"This was an OK place to go. The restaurant was clean, atmosphere was...unremarkable. I wouldn't say my food was spectacular, but it was plenty good enough to visit again if you just have a craving for standard, basic Americanized Chinese food. My waiter seemed very bored because it was quite slow, but I received my food in timely fashion and the prices were more than fair."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! It's waitstaff is super sweet and attentive! Their dinner combos are more than enough!! I always get the sesame chicken and it is always delish!"}
{"text":"Good food, but not any better than you might get at a fast food chinese restaurant.  I had the sesame chicken. It was pretty tasty, and I was pleasantly surprised when it came with steamed broccoli on the side.   The staff was pleasant and the service was quick.  The portions were generous and reasonably priced.    However, there was absolutely no crab or crab flavor in the crab rangoons.   Nothing special but I would probably go back because it's closer to my place than panda."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and delicious. I do not eat here often enough. Portions are generous, facilities are clean, and I have never had a problem with the service. The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for cheap, fast, greasy American Chinese, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The food here was great but the customer service is lacking. They don't refill drinks that fast, splitting the check was a pain, and they always act like they're in a rush even if the restaurant only has a few people in it. It made me feel very unwelcome and our waiter even forgot about giving us boxes, leaving us sitting there for thirty minutes, until we had to ask again. They also don't stop by the tables to check how everything is doing, you have to stop them if you need something. The only thing that makes up for the service was the food. The chef is great. I would recommend, just do takeout!"}
{"text":"This has been our favorite place to order out! They are always fast and food is good!!"}
{"text":"Loved it food was speedy and very delicious. I had the pad Thai noodles I got them med spicy but next time I'll get spicy. My husband got Kung Pao chicken which was super delicious, and he ate all of it. We'll definitely come back soon!!!"}
