{"text":"Great place for Chinese take out, fair price for a good portion of food. I've tried the sweet and sour pork and the pork & green pepper stir-fried, both are very good. Will definitely try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Tried the spicy fish, wait time was reasonable and the dish tasted decent but I'm not sure if it's really worth it at $16 for only a few pieces of meat."}
{"text":"My appetite was not good today so I really wanted some spicy food hoping I can eat a little.  I thought I will call to give it a try since they say take out only. Lucky me, they do delivery for a $3.00 charge. They said I can text to place the order which is absolutely convenient. Text order placed 6:26pm by 7:39pm, I finished eating. They accept cash and credit card.   I placed the order for the following:  1) Fish fillets in chilli oil (very good spicy level with clear noodle inside)  2) Sweet chilli dry tofu (this was good too but I find it a little on the sweet side. I guess after all, it does say \"sweet chilli\" I will definitely order from them again. I am a spicy food lover. Usually decent quality spicy fish don't do delivery!"}
{"text":"I just tried this place and I found it really really good. They have a limited menu with 7 items but I think that is a  good thing, it's like they just took the best 7 dishes from a bigger menu and just offered those items. I ordered their braised beef and you can tell that the quality of meat that they use is very good. I'm definitely going to be eating here again and I'm making it my mission to try all the items on their menu!"}

{"text":"Flavourful and delicious with the right amount of spicy. Portions of food is generous for the price. Service is very nice and friendly with prompt readiness of food. Got the fish filet in chill oil, very freshly made! Would come back."}
