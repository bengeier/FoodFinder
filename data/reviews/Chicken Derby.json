{"text":"Very good chicken, potatoes & cole slaw!  Actual place is a little run down & the service is rough but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from them.  Found a pornographic drawing on my bill.  Called the manager, was not helpful.  Will never order from them again."}
{"text":"This is the place where I had my first slice of pizza and its something i will never forget!!!! Huge slices and the best sauce in town. Not to mention excellent fried chicken and the best broasted potatoes!!!! Reasonably priced and great service!!! I wish I still lived in the area because this is the place to go for great picnic and party food."}
{"text":"Closed. They closed. It isn't there anymore. Thank god! Miserable people made you afraid to order!!!"}
{"text":"You've never lived until you tried the broasted chicken. It's the best in pa. may be the best in the country.. great pizza, really great hoagies,best coleslaw around. only high quality ingredients. Try them and see."}
{"text":"Excellent broasted chicken that is cooked to order.  So either call ahead or plan on waiting at least 20 minutes.  It's well worth the wait.   I opted for take out, and ordered the 2 pc breast dinner with the broasted potatoes and cole slaw.  The chicken was perfectly cooked and delicious. The potatoes are served 4 large wedges per serving and they were very good , not at all greasy. The cole slaw serving seemed a little small, but it was good.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Miserable man working at the register taking orders made my first experience very unpleasant. He treated the customers and employees poorly. I get the \"made to order\" in regards to freshness, but at noon on a weekday if you tell me I can't get grilled chicken instead of fried chicken because \"it will take too long\" something isn't right. Got the italian hoagie and it was actually very good. Avoid the gyro.."}
{"text":"Chicken Derby is a staple in our community and provides a great atmosphere for a good lunch or dinner.  They also have great catering services and take out food delivery.  Best chicken around!"}
{"text":"We have driven by Chicken Derby hundreds of times but have never tried it. We've tried other places in the same strip mall so I'm not sure why we've never tried it. Recently one of my Foodie friends went and raved about it. We decided to try it. That was a great choice. 
They have a huge menu. It's a little overwhelming. My thought was we should order chicken entrees since the word Chicken is in the name. My hubby ordered the Chicken Salad sandwich and I ordered the Chicken Breast Plate. 
As for the chicken Salad sandwich you can get items like lettuce, tomato, and cheese added. That's exactly what my hubby did. The sandwich was delicious. It was some of the best Chicken Salad I've had. It wasn't overly filled with mayo or fillers. I would definitely go back and order the sandwich myself or even pick up some to take home or to a picnic. 
The Breast entree came with TWO chicken breasts, coke slaw, and your choice of potato (mashed potatoes, French fries, potato pancakes, or broasted potatoes). The coleslaw was creamy and just the right amount of sweet and tangy. I ordered the mashed potatoes which were smoothe and creamy. They were very good by themselves but the gray was like the icing on the cake. The broasted chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Yum!!!
Inside Chicken Derby they have a deli. I will definitely going back to try some of their items. They also have a refrigerated case that holds milk, butter, and other items you might need. 
You can order whole broasted chicken or orders of 12 or more pieces. They also have catering. Inside the restaurant itself are tables and chairs where you can sit and eat. It's a great little place tucked into a strip mall."}
{"text":"Had to try some of CD's broasted chicken.  Has been a few years since my last visit.   CD was Voted \"Best Chicken by City Paper\".  But CD is much more than chicken.  Good homemade soups, a deli with hoagies, salad, sandwiches, and I hear the pizza is pretty darn good!

Really enjoyed the broasted chicken dinner.  Chicken was tasty, moist, tender and not greasy."}
{"text":"Food is ok although the service leaves a lot to be desired. The help there is miserable.  I'll probably go back and just ignore the grumpy staff."}
