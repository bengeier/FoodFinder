{"text":"The location is great! It's nice to look out the window and not have to look at a parking lot. The interior decor was welcoming, modern and clean looking. The hostess and waiter were pleasant; no small-talk, to the point but friendly. The food was awesome and reasonably priced for the high-quality. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Because of what I've heard I've waited till my 4th visit to write a review, one of the topics was inconsistency

I'm not really sure what these people were talking about, from the moment I walked in to the moment  I left not a thing was out of place 

appetizers we had:

Beef carpaccio with arugula and shaved parmiggiano 
Octopus carpaccio 
Rosemary focaccia 

All fantastically prepared and made to order, very fresh!!!!

I had the linguine with Lobster as a main and my guest had the grouper 

Again everything was perfect, delicious and freshly prepared 

The Waite staff was very courteous and checked on us regularly 

As I said above this was my 4th visit and don't have a single negative thing to say

If you haven't been and don't like going downtown for fine dinning, I would really highly recommend eating here, this particular visit was lunch, their dinner menu is much better 

Have fun and enjoy..... I know I did! And I'm sure you will too"}
{"text":"THANK YOU AVENUE!

My boyfriend and I will soon be moving to Kleinburg and thankfully we have already found a \"go-to\" restaurant.

Avenue has amazing interior designing inside and out. They have the large pana doors that open in the summer which allows lots of sunlight and \"summer vibes\" to enter the room.
The inside of the restaurant has a nice classy and elegant feel - i love it!

The waiter we had was funny, helpful and efficient!

I am looking forward to more future visits :)

{"text":"Horrible and rude service. My husband ordered an expensive bottle of wine and the waiter had the nerve to ask him whether he knew how much the bottle was. Also seated at a table right by the door - practically in the doorway - even though there were plenty of empty tables. And when we asked to move they told us no.

We will never go here again."}
{"text":"Rude waiter. Was rushing us the whole time to order our mains. Was asking us if we wanted more wine while standing at the table next to us. Horrible service.  Waiter ruined the whole night."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Service is ridiculously slow, prices are obnoxious for the portion size. Have gone a few times and every single time I leave gawking at how much I had to pay for such little food. And we often have to wait for what seems like almost an hour to get our food,

What is it about Kleinburg that these restaurants want to overcharge everyone? I live locally and wanted the convenience of eating out close by. From now on, just drive that extra 10 or 15 minutes into Woodbridge to get better service, food and prices."}
