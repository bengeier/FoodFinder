{"text":"The food is fair but the service is not even that good.  We used to frequent this restaurant once or twice a week but got tired of being treated as if our being there was an inconvenience."}
{"text":"Really good food, prices and decor. Meals are hot and served quickly. Staff has always been very friendly. Very good frozen margaritas. Tables or booths are available. There is a small area outside for seating.  We like the fact that the atmosphere is appealing and the place is always very Restrooms are immaculate."}
{"text":"This place has great margaritas and the food is good, but the service is slow and unfriendly. I have gone there several times because I like the drinks and every time I am disappointed with the service and the bathrooms are always dirty."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the shrimp tacos. The shrimp were large and I received a generous portion. As a first course I had the tortilla chicken soup which was delicious.  The servers especially Alejandra were attentive and pleasant. The bill was quite reasonable and we recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the price!!! I've never paid this much for Mexican food in my life! We can usually take our family out for $40-50, which is why we usually choose Mexican.  We got absolutely nickeled and dimed here!! No drinks came with kids meals, each drink cost $2.50. So that's $12.50 in drinks alone.  I asked for a side of lettuce, got charged $2 for that.  Asked for sour cream, they brought us 2 sides even though we asked for one, got charged $2.50 each!! I couldn't believe my eyes when my bill came, $75 for 3 kids meals and 2 adults!!! Food was just ok, no better than other Mexican.  Next time I guess we'll just go to Taco Bell. What a rip off!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tres Potrillos is my favorite Mexican restaurant, but this place is a close runner up. Probably one of the better Mexican restaurant in the Kent area!"}
{"text":"Before this place became La Terraza, it was this trashy place called Guacamoles. The walls were splattered and finger painted with all these tacky colors. And the waitresses were the MEANEST around. It was so bad that it was funny.   Then it got a major overhaul to become the classy, well-designed La Terraza!  This place has AMAZING food. Oh. My. Gosh. I got this burrito that had chicken, shrimp AND chorizo in it, slathered in white queso sauce. LAWDDD. I'm still thinking about how good it tasted. Ugh!   Our waitress and the other employees were friendly and kind.   The only reason I didn't rate five stars is because of their margarita pitcher. To be a top notch Mexican place you have got to have a solid margarita. I had two margaritas from this $20 pitcher and did not even feel slightly buzzed. Nobody wants to drop $20 on alcohol and not even get tipsy. Amiright?!"}
{"text":"So good! The margaritas are almost as good as the food. The staff is friendly (now) and the younger lady there is the best server I have had in a long time. I miss the rice they had when they first opened, but I just don't order rice anymore (the new rice without potatoes is boring and bland) and am always pleased."}
{"text":"Excellently presented and cooked Mexican cuisine. Prices are reasonable and the service is great! Highly recommended for all"}
{"text":"So happy that La Terraza opened up this location. Excellent Mexican food for the price! Our group had lunch fajitas, enchiladas, and one of the burritos. Generous portions and everybody was satisfied. If you like Mexican food come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Love it here! My favorite Mexican resturant in all of akron area! Great service, great food and great people!"}
{"text":"This place has come a long way from what it used to be. The previous business was called Guacamole and it was awful! The place was ragged, food was basic and the service was the worst of my life. But not this place has completely changed! The inside has been redone to be a little more up to date and the staff is on top of it! Our server was incredibly nice and our food came out quick. We had skinny margaritas, and I order the Mexican tacos. Which were great. The meat was well cooked and they gave plenty! Also I love the salsa verde they give on the side. Their chips and salsa is really good too, a nice sweet not too chunky salsa. I always say the chips and salsa is an important intro to any Mexican place. You just have to have that be a good start. It's literally your bread and butter, and this place passes!  We started off with queso and it's your standard white queso but that's exactly what I wanted! They have plenty of hot sauces on the table. My one complaint which I won't let it effect the score is the margarita wasnt that strong. It's almost $12 and it's huge but was weak. They should put atleast 2 shots in this drink and it's maybe one."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, awesome Margerita's and yummy food. We went in and sat at the bar for an afternoon and had really great service! I would recommend the corona-rita"}
{"text":"Love this place, great margaritas, food, and staff."}
{"text":"This used to be called Guacamoles, and that was good, but La Terraza is even better in my book.  The decor is updated and much better looking.  Great eye appeal.  The place, and the bathrooms, are clean and neat.  The host/hostess is always pleasant and the the staff is friendly and patient.  They always are able to answer our questions and they treat my sons wonderfully as well.  My oldest is Autistic and has learned how to order for himself.  I love how receptive they are to him and his limited abilities.  The food is wonderful.  Everything we have ever ordered has come out steamy hot.  The amount you get is worth the cost you pay.  The flavors always dance in my mouth.  I love the salsa that comes with the tortilla chips.  I was told they make it fresh daily.   You can't go wrong here.  You just can't.  I will definitely be a regular here!!"}
