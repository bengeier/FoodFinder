{"text":"The food was not bad for a buffet, I enjoyed what they offered. My expectations were not too high to begin with, so i was not dissapointed. However, the same could not be said for the customer service that me and my group of friends recieved. We were a group of 5 well-behaved college students who came in for the Friday evening dinner, and upon being seated, one of the waitresses questioned our ability to afford paying - she awkwardly reminded us the price per person, making us feel confused and unwelcome - terrible customer serivice on her part. While we were there enjoying our meal, waitresses kept standing around talking to each other and looking at us suspiciously as if they expected us to be unable to pay. Later, when I attempted to get a waitresses' attention to ask a question, she looked at me without saying anything, and then walked away. Although not every member of the staff at the restaurant behaved in this manner towards us, I will feel reluctant to come back here if this continues to take place."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch. The sweet and sour chicken balls are always good. The noodles have never disappointed me. I love the sushi."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants that i've been to, its part of the memories that i have in both growing up and in living in Toronto.   The food there, though mostly fried, is delicious, the quantities and varieties are a lot!  The price is also very cheap when you compare it to the amount and quality of food that you get.  best thing is, its ALL YOU CAN EAT!!!  Love it, if i go back to Canada, Mandarin is on the top of my to do list."}
{"text":"My job takes me all over the GTA, and the highlight of my road trips is always lunch at mandarin with my co-workers. I agree with the previous commentator - Mandarin's Erin Mills location does have a busy parking lot, so just an fyi when you are in the lot to be more aware of your surroundings."}
{"text":"We had booked reservations for 5:30pm for a party of 10 on a Saturday and we waited in a very crowded entrance of the restaurant  for over 20 mins (it was beyond crowded, people were bumping into us, we felt like we were at the airport!)  If weren't for my husband having to remind them that we were here, who knows how long we would have waited.  It was almost 6:00 pm when we were finally seated but then as we got up to get our food- someone had threw up right on the floor near the buffets. Needless to say, I lost my appetite and had no desire to stay but as I didn't want to make a scene as it was a farewell dinner for a family member going back to Europe.  I forced myself to eat (after the cleanup and the smell went away). The chicken balls were very stale and the food just wasn't tasting the same to me. Maybe it was because the place was so crowded that people were jam packed in the buffet aisles that we were almost rubbing shoulders together.  I think that Mandarin must have overbooked that night, how else would they explain the wait.  We had reservations, it's not as if we just walked into the restaurant off the street!  I always feel sick the day after eating at Mandarin, do they still use MSG in their food?  It seems that way to me.   To top off, they had a cotton candy stand right next to the food - just what we needed when we have a picky 10 year old with us.  He ended up getting 3 servings of cotton candy!  Was it any surprise that he hardly touched any of his food??  Why would they need cotton candy at a buffet restaurant??  I wouldn't recommend Mandarin, there are a lot better places out there to eat at."}
{"text":"The food here is okay, not the best I had ever had, but it's not bad.  I ordered food here for delivery and I wasn't sure if it was actual fresh food they were delivering to us or not but it certainly didn't have the \"I just cooked this\" taste written all over it.  The delivery is a relative speed I would say, as the food arrived warmish? I would probably say this would be a 3.5 stars restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about mandarin. It's a chain restaurant, to boot, which really isn't my favorite. The second shortfall is that Mandarin is a buffet, I've never liked those. The third is that it's Chinese food themed, which is unfortunate, because I don't particularly like Chinese. That's three strikes.  The decor is terrible. It's tacky to put it plainly. What can you really expect though, it's a buffet. The dining room/s are just crowded in tables. I find it quite uncomfortable.  There are a few good food options, but a lot to be avoided. I like the Torpedo shrimp, the sushi, and any fish options they offer. The rest tends to be less than stellar.   The service is non existent, as it's a buffet. Actually someone comes to refill your water every little while.   I don't know about Mandarin. I hate how it feels to be full. Mandarin is pretty expensive, you have to eat a lot to make it worthwhile, and I don't like that. I'd take one good plate of food anytime, over many plates of mediocre slop."}
{"text":"Came here again to redeem the free lunch coupons we had received from our previous visit, and the quality was just as good. Had a lunch buffet that consisted of sauteed green beans, baked salmon, salad, lots of salt-and-pepper calamari and a plate full of no-sugar cheesecake. So good.  Even my grandfather (who complained the last time that the menu wasn't up to his standards, and found everything to be \"too battered\") ordered a plate of chicken fried rice and loved it.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"While driving to Toronto, I went to a different Mandarin location. The place is packed at night, and they have more food to offer at Dinner. The service and food is fine and enough to let you fee satisfied for a guy from Chinese food desert city."}
{"text":"Avoid this place during diner hour.  They allow so many to people onto the wait list that it literally becomes a fire hazard for everyone in the lobby as people cannot even make it to the exits.  I'd comment on the food but 1.5 hours later, we gave up after never getting a table."}
{"text":"Love the food here and the staff is super kind and friendly. Not the best Mandarin I've ever been to but it is definitely still a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Avoid this like the plague. Awful customer service and just completely chaotic during dinner waits. The restaurant should be turning patrons away once they notice the building can't actually hold any more people. Worst mandarin I've ever been to."}
{"text":"I used to work at Mandarin as a teenager, but I solemnly swear that my opinion is not biased. Mandarin ALWAYS has a ridiculously long wait so make reservations, you'll end up waiting too lol. I don't, because I don't usually plan where I eat ahead, and usually just end up at Mandarin out of sudden cravings for crab legs. The best thing on the menu, and the only thing worth coming to Mandarin for. Crab legs are expensive so, whenever I'm craving seafood, I go to Mandarin for my fix. It makes it worth the $26 per person pricing, of course though I wont pass the desert table. Dinner foods, has the basics, but nothing outstanding. Lets be real though, the seafood is the best thing they've got to offer. Shrimp, mussels, oysters, crabs."}
{"text":"Great  place to go, but you should bring your appetite! They have great foods in the buffet for the whole family. They have Chinese foods and American foods, all you can eat buffet. great salad bar and an ice cream bar that kids just love! They is also more desserts than just ice cream and for a family gathering it is the perfect place to go."}
{"text":"If I could give Mandarin a 5 rating for their service and a 3.5 for the food I would do that.     Frightfully efficient and friendly service team provides an excellent positive experience constantly refilling your water, clearing plates, and making sure you have everything you need.  The food...  IMHO has been slowly declining  mainly in variety as well as a bit in quality. They still make a mean chicken ball, spring roll, chicken wing, and most of the staples but certain items that have higher food costs have disappeared off the menu to be replaced by cheaper items.  On a Friday night, a cuttlefish salad was not available, alot of scrawny crab legs and not many claws, and chicken dumplings that were not really dumplings but rather a wrapper that was haphazardly folded in half with a smush of ground chicken.  Desserts were mainly good but some of the cream pies tasted like edible oil products and not much else.  Having said that, it's still a decent buffet in comparison to others out there so when you want a huge variety and / or wish to be a glutton, just go for it."}
{"text":"Ice cream buffet!!!  This was my favorite part!  They don't have anything like this in Los Angeles.  They had 10 different types of ice cream to choose from:  Peppermint, orange sherbert, black cherry, lime sherbert, choco chip, strawberry sherbert, and others!  I can't remember them all.  The ice cream was super delicious too.  *happy*  Food:  The food was pretty good.  It wasn't amazing.  Better than average.  I'd probably give it a 3.5 for the food itself.  I do like that they had 4 different types of soup:  Clam chowder, miso, egg drop with mushroom, and wonton.  Lots of variety also with the solid foods.  Salad bar was pretty good too.  Parking:  Parking isn't too bad.  But getting into the lot is a little difficult since it's next to a Starsky, which is a super busy supermarket.    Entrance:  Really?  Just a rotating door followed by a normal swing door.  It does keep the cold out... but it's also a little difficult to get in.  Maybe 2 swing doors would have been better.  Apparently a popular chain here in Canada!  I'm visiting from LA and my aunt and uncle took me and my family here for lunch.  Pretty good with decent prices.  I hear it's cheaper when it's not holiday season.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from this location and it was very disappointing. We had egg rolls, wontons, soft noodles, and diced vegetables with almonds. The egg rolls and wontons were fine, but nothing great. The noodles were cold and very salty. They forgot to put almonds with the vegetables and there were only onions and some green pepper and mushrooms  in it with a few tiny pieces of carrot and corn. The sauce in the vegetables was slimy and we ended up throwing it out. I will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner, the lineup was so so long. I actually tried to call for a reservation but the line was always busy. So we ended up waiting for almost an hour. Weekend dinner price is 32.99 now which has gone up a lot over the past few years. And the food was the same food. Kind of disappointed with the food, not much to choose."}
{"text":"The desserts were probably the best part! There's so much of a variety of desserts here that I could eat for the days The decor was amazing which makes your fall in love with the place instantaneously!  Would go back again!"}
{"text":"It's Mandarin.  Its buffet.  Its gluttonous.  Its overindulgence.  Its tasty. What can I say?  I was very impressed with it not being salty like many AYCE can be.  The fruits and vegetables was fresh.  You cannot expect a huge buffet like this to be fine dining.  So keep your expectations realistic.    Ok you cannot hate on this place.  Yes it is a bit pricey , but its so good.     I loved the service though.  Amazing.  My table was always cleared, my soda was topped off quickly, and water glasses never empty."}
{"text":"This location is very busy but the staff do a great job of servicing tables and keeping the food fresh and available  Food quality keeps getting better and a wide selection of items to choose from"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and i can say that its just like every other Mandarin. nothing that much special then the others.  It has 2 long aisles of the buffet and apart from the grill aisle where you can your meats and such. I come here because its close to me and the service is good. The price isn't so expensive so that is indeed a plus. What i can say is that the staff here is very nice and helpful if your looking for something specific or anything.  i always try to come here as much as i can, as long as my stomach allows me too."}
{"text":"Avoid Manadarin Erin Mills location during Dumpling Festival.  They cut back and cut corners on the weekend by NOT offering ALL the dumplings as stated in their advertisement.  Talk about FALSE ADVERTISING.  Asked about the missing dumplings and all they say is \"it's not available\" (??)  What the ??  it's a dumpling festival, you should have it available. Complained to Manager and Head Office and all they said was \"sorry\".  What crappy customer service. Definitely not spending my money there EVER again."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!! I love how they always refilled my water because I'm a water freak LOL. the food is good. it would be nice if they had more choices. recommended :) !!!"}
{"text":"pretty great place. you can really make it worth your while if you love lobster & snow crab since that's often part of their menu.   otherwise, they have a pretty great selection of other Asian foods and they even serve cotton candy as you leave! :D"}
{"text":"I was not very impressed with this location.  When we arrived, we were told that it would be about a 10 minute wait for our table, but it turned out to be more like 30 minutes.    When I got to my table, I pulled out my chair and there was a dirty napkin on the seat, left behind by the previous patron.  Our waiter also was not very attentative as dirty dishes remained stacked on our table.    Overall the food was decent, except for the Boston \"Clam\" Chowder - there wasn't a single clam to be found in the pot, just a bunch of potatoes."}
{"text":"Erin mills is one of my favourite locations, and I've been to nearly every Mandarin location!  The staff are always fantastic!   I LOVE the prime rib (as good as the keg's honestly).  And who can turn down all you can eat crab?  I like the peel and eat shrimp too, and the lemon chicken.  I do have to say that I'm very disappointed that Mandarin chose to jack their prices up soooo much.  I mean from $26.99 to $30.99?  That's A LOT of difference in price.  In fact, that represents a whopping 15% increase in prices.  Don't get me wrong, with all they offer on the buffet, a price increase was justified.  Just NOT THAT big an increase.  Now, I can only justify going every once and a while, whereas I used to go a couple of times a month before.  Sigh.  Also, I can't wait for Chinese new year to start on the 20th.  I love siu mei and har gow and I guess I'm too lazy to drag my butt to dim sum!"}
{"text":"Your standard Mandarin, but I personally thought the service here was a lot better than other locations, and the food didn't taste as though it was left out all day. Granted, I also went in the afternoon so I'm sure the earlier the fresher, but I was definitely happy with the service."}
{"text":"All Mandarins are pretty much the same in my experience. Clean, efficient staff, lots of food, good about restocking. Food won't rock you to your core but here it's about quantity. So many choices, so much to taste. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad. It's just of the mass produced variety. Doesn't stop me from coming here and stuffing my face though. This one has jelly fish in the aquarium, which to me are so pretty and almost magical looking. So this provided endless entertainment and smiles for me. Kids seemed to love them too. Dessert? Why yes, I will have two of everything! It's not all fab, but again, it's a feast for the eyes so I end up having a bit of way too many things. Most is good. If all else fails, something about Mandarin jello is great and it's a wonderful fall back."}
{"text":"Came here on Christmas Eve last year and Christmas Day this year with my family, I don't have a lot of memory of the former, so I'll review this meal. Starting off we arrived and waited in the super fun line of other people who had made reservations, luckily there were lovely pink mints to keep me from starving.  We were seated and waited for the rest of our family, the waitress was pretty nice but when everyone arrived, my grandfather tried to order several different beers and was comically denied. The waitress kept avoiding his question for different beers and basically forced him to order the beer she recommended. It was kind of funny, but also not. I'm surprised my grandfather didn't yell at her.  Anyway, food time! So I started off with the Singapore noodles as they are my favourite noodles of Chinese cuisine (though mandarin isn't exactly real Chinese food). They were ok, I've definitely had worse, but they had too much cumin in their curry powder and not enough salt. However it was dry and not liquidy, which is a plus. The meatballs were pretty good, I think they had wheat in them, because I died a little bit after, though that might've been the onion rings, which were solid with red sauce, something I haven't seen in ages.   The BBQ rib was pretty great, I should've gotten a second one. But I was too overwhelmed and needed to sample everything. The curry wasn't curry enough, should've taken some cumin from the noodles. It was very lacking in flavour and creaminess. But again, it's Mandarin and I probably shouldn't expect things from it that it won't deliver.  The prime rib was amazing. I could've just eaten that, but I was getting full by the time I hit it. The mashed potatoes lacked salt and butter.  Finally the desserts, the NY Cheesecake was the winner in terms of cheesecakes. It was firm and delicious. The cheesecake squares felt like they didn't set? Does cheesecake set? It was runny.  The banana ice cream was very real in flavour, not artificial tasting, I just didn't love it too much. But the peppermint ice cream. That was amazing. I need more of it. A constant IV of peppermint ice cream. It was just perfect. It kind of made me think of green tea ice cream, but less matcha.  All in all it was a good time. 4/5"}
