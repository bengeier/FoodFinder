{"text":"Forget about dessert. Not that they aren't tasty it's just that you will not have room. I had the egg plant parm. Great taste and the side spaghetti was a full meal on its own. My wife had the chicken picatta she couldn't finish it. Again too big for us. They also have a nice draft brew selection. Will return and bring a few of my friends. MY meal for tomorrow will be tasty leftovers. Wish it was a bit closer."}
{"text":"We had a 70th birthday party for my girlfriend.  There were 15 of us.  When we arrived  arrived for our 5 o'clock reservation we were told we had to be out by 7 o'clock because there was another party at that time.  We just got done paying our bills at 7:10 and the birthday person was just starting to open her gifts and we were told we had to leave immediately because the other party was here.  When we booked we were never told that there was a time limit on how long you could stay. We had to hurry up and gather all the presents and leave.  This is very poor customer service and needless to say we will never be back and we will be sure to spread the word.  They rushed us through dinner .  The food was served in large portions {entirely too large} and the quality wasn't all that great. They lost several good customers. Just remember if you are having a party make sure you eat fast because you won't have time to socialize. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"We went to Olives & Peppers for the second time last night. Food was fantastic and so was our service. Place was busy but you would have thought we were the only family in the place. Our Server Ryan was outstanding. She was very attentive and friendly. We would go back and asked for her again. Food was like homemade, nothing from a box."}
{"text":"I live in the area and thought I was going to the previous resturant, what a wonderful surprise.  The food was amazing, true fresh herbs, wonderful flavor and large portions. The Village of Level Green and Penn Twp needs a resturant like this.  We will go back and highly recommend it to everyone. Neighbors have gone and given it thumbs up as well.  Need a little more organization but it is still new.  Go try it out for yourself."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite restaurant. Everything on the menu is great. The drinks made by our favorite bartender jen skiffen are the best in town!"}
{"text":"Wow. Words can't begin to describe the disappointment I had at this restaurant. The service was absolutely horrible. Our server took 20 minutes to bring our drinks, though that could be because the bartender was incompetent because when we got our drinks they tasted like koolaide. We didn't get our food for about 45 minutes and when it came it was not the great food I had read about from other reviewers. It was pretty average, nothing spectacular. We all shared at our table so I was able to taste quite a few things, including the greens & beans, pizza, and ravioli and a few other things. Really I will not waste my time or money going back there. From what I saw the management really doesn't know what they are doing and are doomed to fail. Large portions will not save you from mediocre taste, lousy drinks, and crappy service."}
{"text":"Best meal ever. Great atmosphere. Our waitress Laura was amazing. I highly Recommend this restaurant. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Same as the negative comments, and many of them..... We had reservations at 7 pm. I understand you will not get seated right away, 7:55 we walked out and went to Luccis. We saw 2 families there that did the same. I read a comment from a customer stating that they got \"kicked\" out  after their hour of sitting because others were waiting for a reservation.... A staff tried to explain why on here, so she basically confirmed that was true. Why didn't this happen for us?  This was our 2nd and last attempt there! DON'T TAKE RESERVATIONS IF YOU CANT MAKE THEM HAPPEN.... I was a manager at a restaurant for 4 years and you don't let this happen."}
{"text":"If your looking for delicious Italian dishes made with fresh ingredients and served in generous portions, this is the place to go to in Pittsburgh. Everyone loved the Zucchini Fritti we ordered as an appetizer and we were blown-away by the size of our entrees: a couple Italian Hoagies, an order of Penne Pasta in Marinara, and Beef & Cheese Ravioli. Everything was delicious and we'll definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Went here for Father's Day in 2016.  It was halfway between my parents house and my house and I really try to fight against the mentality to just go to a Darden restaurant because of their recognizable brands and the mentality that you know you are going to get something decent but probably not amazing. Ultimately ended up getting the same quality here. Three of four in party said food was decent but not amazing. Stromboli was huge and good! Service was nice. Atmosphere was also nice and decor recently updated. Would probably go again if I lived near the restaurant and the bar also looked like a nice upscale place to watch a game but not if the game was the primary reason you were going."}
{"text":"I had a burger from this place and it was one of the best burgers I've had in a long time.  I actually think I liked it more than Burgatory.  I would definitely come back to this place and eat again.    Everything else was great too.  The restaurant is very clean and the wait staff are great.  Happy to do business with a quality establishment."}
{"text":"Just ordered penne with vodka sauce  really got rigatoni with vodka sauce not to much for $15 thought it was Italian restaurant!"}
{"text":"4/5 stars due to the bad attitude, unprofessionalism and rudeness of the young hostess. Isn't the hostess supposed to be warm and welcoming as they are the first impression guests receive upon enter? Other people I know that went a different time as us stated the same thing about the hostess.   The food was great, huge portions at an affordable price. Definitely make reservations a couple days in advance especially for weekends.   Overall food was very good and would return again"}
{"text":"After hearing the hype about this place we had to check it out. Well I was disappointed from the beginning. Had reservations and still have to wait about a hour, waitress wasn't friendly whatsoever and the food wasn't worth the money."}
{"text":"Wow. Hoping they were just having an off night. They didn't have our reservations (placed the day before), the hostess disappeared for almost ten minutes and came back with no solution but to add us to the list of names. Folks ahead of us had reservations and had been sitting for a long time. People behind us had reservations as well and were told it was unknown how long the wait would be. It was chaos and the staff appeared to be in over their heads. Lots of tables with people clearly waiting for food or for dishes to be cleared. We were sent to the bar to wait but there was no room--lots of people complaining about service. This was our first visit and we were anxious to check it out. Can't comment on the food because we finally pulled our name and went elsewhere. Perhaps another time will be a better experience but we are not in a hurry to go back based on this situation."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a restaurant that was new for us today.  I was hungry for lasagna.  I thought the price was a bit steep, but ordered it anyway.  Came with a bowl of wedding soup and bread. Liked everything about the meal. Portions were very generous. I am not a soup fan but thought this had a really good taste. The lasagna was served nice and hot covered with a delicious meat sauce.  Also included was warm bread and butter.  Our waitress was very attentive and pleasant.  Overall they exceeded my expectations for a good meal eating out..."}
{"text":"5+ Stars for Tyler. Great Dining Experience   Very generous portions and excellent flavor.   I recommend the zucchini - chicken parm with alfredo"}
{"text":"HUGE portions and great food. I'm 100% Italian and don't usually like Italian restaurants because they're rarely authentic.  Olives and Peppers is like eating at Grandma's."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday at 3:30 to place a large take out order. Stood at the bar no one acknowledged me and I had to get my own menu. Servers/ Bartender standing around talking to each other obviously to busy to wait on me. Ended up leaving and ordering food from Lucci's.  I will not not be eating there anytime soon!"}
{"text":"We were promptly seated.  We had the stuffed banana peppers as an appetizer.  They were stuffed with hot sausage.  Very good.  The house salads were spring greens with olives, cherry tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers.  Very good.  The bread was at least a day old ... yuck  The spaghetti with hot sausage was enough for 2 meals.  The restaurant was willing to replace the cream sauce for a marinara for the shrimp ravioli with lump crab meat.  It was a great choice.  For dessert, we split a slice of almond torte. It was wonderfully moist cake and the icing wasn't too sweet.  Would definitely go back to try other menu options."}
{"text":"I'm not the type to give 5 stars, I enjoy nit picking, but damn this place is good.  Food is awesome, place is clean, staff is very friendly.  Been there 3 times and will be back again."}
{"text":"One of the best places I've eaten on the road! The chicken parm was off the chain good and I had more leftover than I could even eat the next day!"}
{"text":"The food is always excellent here. I love the chicken parm and the meatball calzone. I also love the fish sandwich but they only have it during Lent and even then they only serve it on Fridays. Best fried fish sandwich you'll get anywhere."}
{"text":"First time visit, but definitely will go back. it was my husband and myself; but we both took home leftovers. The fried zucchini was good but typical. The wedding soup on the other hand was very good; salad also very good. Portions are quite large.  My husband had the eggplant parm and when the plate arrived he immediately asked for a box and put half the meal in it. He raved about the dish and thought it was delicious. I had chicken piccata with the creamy risotto, and also put half my meal in a box.  This dish was also very good. We saved room dessert and had the almond torte, which was not too sweet but just right.  They serve their coffee in what looked like a soup bowl, but was nice because my husband didn't need to ask for a refill. All in all it was a very enjoyable meal and would definitely go back.  Reservations are a must!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow.  Steak hoagie served with no steak on it.  30 minutes to replace order.  By this time, all others in my party had finished their meals.  Server wanted paid before food arrived.  Manager begrudgingly removed item from bill and walked away with the check.  He didn't return so I left.  Server followed me out and said I still owed for my $2.00 drink. Behavior of manager and server reprehensible."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Olives and Peppers tonight with another couple. This was our first time here and we were impressed as soon as we entered the restaurant. The decor is welcoming and very well appointed. We had a reservation and were seated immediately in a large booth near a window. The hostess was very friendly as was our server, Laura.       I ordered greens and beans appetizer and it was the best I've had anywhere. My entre was gnocchi with bolognese sauce and the portion was huge! A salad comes with your entre My husband ordered chicken Marsala which comes with a salad and a large side of pasta. All portions are very generous. Our friends loved their dinners as well.       We felt that the prices were reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food. All four of us said that we can't wait to go back! It was just an all around pleasant experience."}
{"text":"We went in June 2017 and had a reservation made for a Friday night and got seated immediately. A reservation is a must on a Friday or Saturday, I watched people just walk in and wait a long time for a table. The service was very good and the food is excellent. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"O&P always serves big portions of their amazing dishes. You truly get what you pay for! My only complaint is the wait times - be sure to make reservations. I wish they had a larger space to accommodate everyone wanting to dine here."}
{"text":"I'm not often speechless, just ask my guy! But after having dinner at Olives and Peppers, I was speechless, at least for an hour or so! On a recent trip to visit friends in this part of Pennsylvania, Olives and Peppers was suggested to us. It is the best restaurant in this area, BAR NONE. We made a reservation because we had heard it was very popular. Our reservation was for a Tuesday night at 7 PM and it was jammed! Tip: make a reservation! We were seated immediately in a booth by the front window which was very welcoming. The menu was very vast: everything from pizza to hoagies to fancy Italian dishes. The woman at the table next to me had calzone and it looked so good that I just had to have it. But how can I choose calzone for my dinner when there were so many other delicious looking items on the menu? So I didn't. I ordered the calzone as an appetizer for the table. First time I've ever had calzone as an appetizer. It was the best calzone I have ever eaten. It was their spinach calzone and it had layers of spinach, layers of cheese on top of that, and baked in the most beautiful crust that was thin and crispy. Fantastic! Next up were our salads which were included with our meals and were a garden salad with our choice of dressing. Very very fresh. Then came the meals. I couldn't resist the chicken Parmesan and I'm so glad I didn't! They gave me three huge chicken breasts smothered in cheese and marinara. I also ordered a side of fettuccine with marinara. All I can say is wow! The best chicken Parm ever and trust me I've eaten it everywhere that I've been. My friend got the lobster ravioli and it was delicious and very tasty! My guy ordered the braised rib Ragu with pappardelle and he loved it! We all tried each other's food and we were so happy we did. All three were the most excellent dishes with the most taste! You might think we wouldn't have room for dessert, but we saved room. We decided to split a dessert three ways and ordered the toasted almond torte. I thought it was a taste sensation! My friend and my guy thought it was too dry, but that just left more for me! We each left with a doggy bag big enough for lunch and dinner the next day. If you miss this restaurant when you're in this area, it is your loss. Shout out to our waitress Megan who is fantastic! We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time at Olive & Peppers and happy to give this restaurant a great review.  This restaurant is situated in Harrison city and for this reason it gets 5 stars for atmosphere, service, and food.   If you are looking for a good restaurant in this area they are going to be hard to beat.  The new clean restaurant had a great atmosphere, however I feel they should dim the lights slightly for a more relaxing feel for dinning.  Debra was our server and she was very professional informative, all around great service.  The food did not disappoint on taste as well as presentation.  The mussels loaded with flavor ... Outstanding, wedding soup with chicken very good as well as salad.  Entrees pasta with vodka sauce ... Spectacular.  Sea Bass with risotto ...  Well the Risotto again spectacular, Sea Bass was way to fishy, something Sea bass should never be. We will definitely be going back to see what else the restaurant has to offer.  INTRIGUED !!!"}
{"text":"amazing! price is a little high for my budget but the food is flawless and the waitress was very nice!"}
{"text":"We have been meaning to try this place. We were celebrating an anniversary and a birthday. There were six in our party. Our server, Ryan was great! She recommended drinks, appetizers and food . She was very knowledgable about everything. We had three appetizers: calamari, which was tender and tasty, greens and beans, which was delicious and bruschetta, which had a tasty tomato topping. The portions are very large and could be shared or taken home. The entrees were wonderful! Chicken Parmesan was enormous, tender and the spaghetti and sauce were wonderful. The other entrees were also delicious . We will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Awesome!!! We ordered TOGO food last week. A steak salad and the bistecca hoagie. Food was fresh, hot, tasty & reasonably priced for the amount of food we got! We will be stopping in for lunch or dinner soon. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I rate this place 4 stars mostly because it's mostly crowed.Buttt,I do really like the pizza there because the sause is fresh and cheese is great!"}
{"text":"All I need to say is ... everything was 5 out of 5 ... great first experience... from the drink service to the entree... great job!"}
{"text":"We visited early on a Sunday evening. Our party of nine was seated quickly.  The restaurant is clean and decorated very festively for the holidays. The wine list and beers on tap are plentiful. We ordered the zuchinni as an appetizer. It was more than enough to share, hot and crispy. The accompanying sauce was delicious. Salads were large and fresh. Bread was brought to the table.  While nothing special it was hot and fresh.  Our orders came to the table a little slow but I think there are still a few kitchen bugs to worn out. The food however was worth waiting for. Everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed their meals. The large calzone was ENORMOUS! Enough for three people. The chicken Parmesan was tender and tasty and again a huge portion. The special of lobster ravioli was smothered in a sauce that made me want to lick the bowl .  The fettuccini Alfredo, spaghetti, and ravioli were all fantastic as well.  Our server was quick, friendly and attentive, what more can you ask for.  We will be returning."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Went here last night and had reservations for 7:00. We were seated at 7:55 after management pushed our original reservation back 15 minutes. Our drinks and food took forever and one member of our party didn't get their food at all (finally got it once everyone was done with their food).    BOTTOM LINE: The food is great. There is no denying that. However, management has a big problem on their hands. And their problem is themselves. The place is way to small to accommodate that many people. They are disorganized and that's not good. You can't seat people an HOUR AFTER THEIR RESERVATIONS!!! If you just sit back and watch the servers, they are rushed, panicked, and overall look stressed.   PREDICTION: I'll give it one more chance because the food is just that good. I will not go on a Friday or Saturday. I will try to go during lunch time on a weekend or wait until the summer and go on a weeknight.   ADVICE FOR OWNERSHIP:  Get your act together.  You are going to lose customers if it continues to be disorganized. Two members of our party already said they're never coming back and that's not good. I'm giving you one more try, O&P, one more!"}
{"text":"I went on the second night of their soft opening. I will wait to give a better performance review. The restaurant was all but empty at the time.  They still need to sort out some bugs. Our waiter was obviously very nervous and just learning the menu. the food on the other hand was excellent. There wine list was extensive. The worest part is they were cash only because their POS system was not active yet."}
{"text":"I really liked my eggplant Parisian here. Crispy, tasty, and cheesy. A bit different than what I'm used to in Europe but this was a really nice take on it. The sauce was also quite nice. My only complaint was that it also came with a 1/2 pound of spaghetti with sauce! The eggplant meal was huge and there is not possible way that anyone could also eat the pasta.  Everyone had absolutely gigantic (no exaggeration) portions. It is really a shame to throw away and very wasteful if you ask me.  Besides giving way too much food and being wasteful, the quality is really good and I would come back again for sure only next time I will ask to just not give me a side dish."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our first visit to Olives & Peppers.  The service was excellent. Our server was friendly and engaged in conversation. All the staff that we met were friendly.  I liked the cozy little wooden bar in the back of the restaurant. The decor was very tasteful and relaxing.  The menu was easy to read. The food was good and prepared quickly and hot.  We will return.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We do Sunday brunch often as well as dinners for special occasions! It's always packed which should tell you something. Always call and make a reservation for a weekend night! Have tried a couple different entrees and all were fantastic!"}
{"text":"First time at this gem, chicken parmigiana was very good (I recommend the marinara sauce which is a thinner version of the chunky house tomato).  The antipasto  salad looked  scrumptious!  Wedding soup was good. Had to request bread, they don't use bread plates here and on Friday and Saturday you have a 90 minute time limit. They are busy!"}
{"text":"Love their chicken Parmesan, Stromboli, and meatball hoagie!  If you get a sandwich you get a whole bag of French fries with it!  Their sauce is so good- you can taste the love put into it!  Definitely make sure you don't eat all day because you get a ton of food for the price!  My husband and I each got 1 entree and it fed us for dinner and lunch and dinner the next day!"}
{"text":"Stopped here one night after hearing rave reviews. First, you need a reservation. We were able to get a seat but took a bit (management and hostess were incredibly sweet!) The portions were huge, neither of us finished our meals so we also had lunch =)"}
{"text":"The pizza here is fantastic. Some of the best I've had in awhile. You really get what you pay for here. It's fresh and delicious. Only concern was that our server only came to take our order, drop off the pizza and then to drop off the check. We wanted water refills and hot pepper flakes for the pizza but never got it."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for dinner the other night for the first time. The place was packed, so we sat at the bar. Which we typically do anyway. Our bartender, Jen was awesome! Not only did she make a perfect martini for me, but she was so much fun to chat with. The food was great and the portions were large. Plenty of leftovers!! Overall, we had an great experience here and will be sure to return. I could use another martini i from Jen! Excited for the Greensburg location to open!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place as I was excited that the previous restaurant that was at this location was closed, and replaced by something MUCH better.  I was not disappointed.  Everything was excellent and the service was exceptional.   I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"We stopped in on Wednesday night debating on whether to sit at the bar or a table. I went to the bar for a glass of wine while I waited for the second party to arrive. Shortly after sitting I decided that we were definitely staying at the bar. Rian was so welcoming and attentive and very helpful when it came to ordering. While observing her attending to her bar guests it was very clear she has perfected the balance of welcoming warmth and professionalism. We ordered two salads a pizza and drinks. The pizza was outstanding. Banana peppers and sausage! The salads are impressive for a house salad. As a former restaurant manager, I'm slightly picky and it is hard to find places that have the food  and service completely on point, but with rian behind your bar you definitely do ! Cheers !"}
{"text":"Great good for Italian style  Good service. Big portions please consider sharing one entree as they are large.  Nice ambiance.  Only thing I would like is to have one or two vegetarian options for dinner other than salad. This is a need now a days. But I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Our waiter was very nice and kept our drinks full. I love the atmosphere as well. This is definitely a place we will recommend and will return to ourselves. We are hoping to have our rehearsal dinner there for our wedding and can not wait to bring our family and friends there for them to try this out as well"}
{"text":"First time visit for dinner, and it was amazing! Caramel Cider Mule was delicious, and the four cheese ravioli with creamy basil sauce was super good too. Their pasta portions are huge, enough to share between two people. Rian at the bar was super attentive, happy, and helpful, always keeping our drinks and stomachs full! The atmosphere is wonderful as well. Definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"The food was not very good. We had terrible service. We will not be coming back. Do not recommend olives & peppers."}
{"text":"SO DELICIOUS!!!  This is one of the best Italian restaurants I have been to in a very long time!! I was a little bit apprehensive after seeing the somewhat negative reviews, but we went for an early dinner so we figured we wouldn't have the problem that others had with the reservations/lack of seating/wait times.  We were thankfully right! Though when we walked in, their phone was ringing off the hook and they kept saying they were booked- validating previous reviews and I was happy I wasn't one of those people.   The restaurant is decorated well and very clean, including the bathrooms.  We were all given water and a hot loaf of bread with butter and then made our selections.   We decided on the fried zucchini appetizer; it seemed to be a bit over fried, as we couldn't really taste the zucchini, but the marinara sauce was absolutely divine so I didn't even care! The zucchini became a vehicle to pile a bunch of sauce onto!! I was so bummed at that point that I hadn't ordered an entree with red sauce; I had already decided on the Aglio Olio pasta with an addition of grilled chicken. My pasta was excellent and the portion was absolutely massive, though I could've done with a bit more sauce, it wasn't dry but the noodles themselves weren't the most flavorful if I didn't add a veggie or piece of chicken in there too.  I also got a side salad and my sister a Caesar salad with our entrees- both were fresh and delicious, and the shaved Parmesan on top just made the salad over the top delicious!  Everyone else in my party was  blown away by the food. My sister got the Lobster ravioli (the ravioli itself seemed to be a cheese ravioli but the sauce was loaded with chunks of lobster meat) and was in heaven, my brother-in-law got the Chicken Romano and almost finished the whole thing, and my boyfriend was happy with his Free Range Roasted Chicken Sandwich.    We will ABSOLUTELY be back!! - the food was downright amazing in my opinion and there was clearly so much care put into each dish. I also thought the prices were very reasonable, and almost a steal at how much food we got."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I recently met part of the family that manages this restaurant and they were great people. I've only been to the one in Harrison city, and had a great experience. I went three times so far and each time was a pleasure.   My family accompanied me and they were pleased as well with the quality of food, the quantity for the price, the friendliness of the staff, and overall atmosphere! I believe I ordered the lasagna the last time I was there, and it was delicious. Too big for me to finish. I forget what my family bought, but I remember it looked delicious.   This is a great hidden gem in penn trafford. I was told there is also another location in gibsonia, I think, and I've heard good things about that one as well. I would definitely go out of my way to eat at this restaurant. I speak for my family and I, and this place was amazing."}
{"text":"I was here twice, when it was Giuseppe's and twice was two times too many. I heard from several people that Olives & Peppers was now a go-to place - new ownership, new menu, new name!   My husband and I stopped in here on a Saturday afternoon. It was around 1:30, so I'm assuming that we missed the lunch crowd. We were greeted immediately upon entering and taken to a booth. There were a handful of people at the bar and three or four tables of diners. I saw two waitresses running around, cleaning and taking care of their tables. We were greeted warmly by our waitress and throughout the meal, she was friendly and attentive.  We ordered calamari for an appetizer...it was okay, but not the best I'd ever had. Looking back, I wish we wouldn't have gotten it, because it was simply too much food. For our meals, my husband chose the chicken parm, which came with a side of spaghetti and your choice of soup or salad (he got wedding soup). I got a steak salad, but asked if I could sub grilled chicken for the steak, which was not a problem. According to the waitress, all of the dressings are home made...I went with balsamic and it was delicious.   Although we were warned ahead of time that the portions were huge, I guess our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, because we could not finish our meals...which is rare for both of us. I mean, I couldn't finish a salad! We didn't even touch the bread! My husband received a decent sized bowl of spaghetti and three pieces of chicken....he said it was very good. I had a taste of the chicken and I have to agree it was tasty. The sauce was seasoned well and not too thick, not too thin.   My only complaint is that the meals are rather pricey. Sure, you get a lot of food, but it's way too much for one person to eat. Sure, you can split a meal, but what if you both don't want the same thing? The plus side to this is that you most definitely have left overs for later!"}
{"text":"Excellent food & service.  Staff & clientele extremely cordial.  I went there for my birthday, and had been wanting to try them for some time.  Great Find in the East."}
{"text":"Our favorite Italian restaurant!!!!  Marina is wonderful and the portions are huge.... an entire pound of spaghetti!  Best around..."}
{"text":"I am out of touch with other Yelp reviewers on this one.  Three stars (average) is all they get from myself with my husband being in agreement about the average status.  The good:  It's a nice looking establishment.  We came on a weeknight so reservations were not necessary on this particular evening.  Pasta dishes come with complementary bread that was fresh, warm, and oh, so soft.  The average:   Service was rather slow for it not being packed.  Our order was taken on the 4th trip to our table by our server.  Trip 1 was to get our drink order.  Trip 2 was to bring us water as our wine was not yet ready.  Trip 3 was to bring our wine with a  \"I'll be back in a minute\" statement.  Trip 4 finally was to get our dinner order.    I ordered the 4 cheese ravioli; my husband ordered some special pasta sheets and 3 ocean critters.  My order came with what I call fake cheese.  Fake as in powdered stuff with a shelf life meant for nuclear attack kinda fare.  No fresh grated cheese was offered.  Come on!  My bar for ratings occurs right here.  Even chain Olive Garden offers me fresh grated cheese and lots of it.  If you can't do that, ya don't deserve to be in business as a Pasta place with more than 3 stars from this gal.  Period.  End of discussion.  Husband's dish meant what it said -- pasta sheets wound around ingredients 3 or 4 times.  So much pasta that my husband discarded much of it.  Why they couldn't just fill some pasta shells instead.... who knows.  Both dishes came with a bowl of wedding soup.  I know wedding soup and like it but this wasn't very special and was certainly not very seasoned.  If my eyes were blind-folded, I would have guessed it to be Campbell's soup with stars and some chicken. (Sorry, Campbell's.)  Our second glass of wine ordered while we were dining on the entrée came way after we downed the last bite with an apology from our server about the bartender something or other.    As I said, I don't know what other reviewers that gave them 5 stars saw or tasted.  Our experience didn't match up.  Would I come here again?  Most likely not.  I like Olive Garden just fine -- they always deliver what they promise and it tastes fine, especially with fresh grated cheese galore as an option."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here with friends after I kept hearing about it from my coworkers. We were skeptical - wondering whether the food was truly great or if it was just the only place around. Now, we will definitely be eating here again. My husband declared that it was his favorite italian meal from any restaurant in the area. He had the Strozzapreti which was wonderfully spicy and I had the lamp pappardelle. The bread served for the table was fantastic as well. The service was quick and everything was perfect. I cannot wait to go back and try more of their dishes.   Be sure to call ahead and make reservations! Many walk-ins were turned away as we waited to be seated. The food is great and the space isn't huge so demand will certainly be high on the weekends, especially."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff.  Had the house salad which was fresh with great house dressing.  Lobster ravioli was amazing and the coconut cream torte was outstanding.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"What's great to me about this locally owned and very ambitious restaurant is its multiple levels of appeal. Craft brew folks, Italian culinary interests, lovers of unique ambiance and fans of the more than generous portion sizes this is your stop! O&P utilizes good service, great food, excellent selections in all supporting cast members (apps, wines and beer choices) and spins them into an experience...not just a nice night out. Try the calzone...I have eaten them all over the US and this place has them to die for (and their will be left overs! :) awesome."}
{"text":"I seriously couldn't get home fast enough to write this review. I've heard NOTHING but positive things about Olives and Peppers, their name was huge in Penn Trafford before they even had a sign up on the restaurant. We ordered pizza, take out for dinner today. Upon arriving to the restaurant, the woman who greeted me was so sweet, she directed me towards the bar to pick the pizza up. I had my son with me, my thirsty son, who asked the woman behind the bar for a drink... She unexpectedly made him a \"special\" drink (Shirley temple I believe) which made his day, since ya know, he was just dying of thirst. She also, was extremely kind, and super interactive with him in the 2 minutes that it took her to get his drink together.  I hadn't even tried their food and I already couldn't wait to give them more business and spread the word that I highly recommend them! After getting us home and trying the pizza, holy smokes!! Can I give them 10 stars? The pizza is hands down, the best in town. We absolutely will be going back to try more menu items and I'm willing to bet that Olives and Peppers will be our new pizza go to. I am so glad that we have a yummy, friendly restaurant in the area!!"}
{"text":"We love, love, love it here! It's such a quaint and awesome restaurant with only a handful of tables! The food is GREAT, the portions are large and the service is good! The mushroom ravioli is my go-to meal and the stuffed banana pepper appetizers are great! Call ahead for reservations if you go because if you don't, you likely won't get in!"}
{"text":"This is not where to go on a diet.   This is where to go to enjoy a fabulous meal that will make you happy now and later, because you'll have plenty for lunch tomorrow!  The small calzone is huge. And stuffed with goodness.   The steak hoagie had been pronounced BEST IN CLASS.   The pasta is perfect and however it is accented will not let you down.  The bread is crisp and tender.  You know exactly what that means...  pass the butter.  Don't hoard the bread, they will bring more!  We've been here several times.  Will be back, for sure.  It's not located in a prized area, moderate traffic... but make a reservation because lots of people know this food and make this trip.   And you'll love the staff because they are all happy to help you have a fabulous meal (and lunch tomorrow)."}
{"text":"We stoped here on our way home to Pittsburgh from Falling Waters. We were looking for something on Yelp with good reviews. I can definitely see why! Food was delish.  We were asked if we had reservations (Tuesday night) and we didn't, but they were still able to seat us. The place isnt huge and the food is good so seating is limited and I can see why you might need to make reservations. Cassie was our server and she was very informative, helpful, and attentive throughout our entire meal.  We got the calamari which was melt in your mouth tender. The house sauce that came with it was very good as well, so I'm sure their pastas are delish.   We both had the one special.... We always try to get different entrees so we can try each other's, but this one looked so good neither of us could resist.  It was a Pecan Smoked 16oz pork chop with an apple brandy sauce over top of aged cheddar polenta with bacon Brussel Sprouts. Um. Can you say, amazing?  It was actually two pork chops each as Cassie explained they weigh it out to make sure you get the full 16oz so depending on the cut, it may come out as one big one or two smaller. Two smaller were definitely welcomed by us because we both only ate half of our meal. It was huge. So for $24 we both basically got two meals.  (I'll post a pic, check it out)  I would definitely recommend this place and we will definitely be back. There were some pasta dishes on their calling my name, and the fiancé was eyeing those calzones that also looked epic!"}
{"text":"It would have been a three star but my wife's experience was better than mine.  My sea bass was just so so.  It could have been any fish in its place.  Not much flavor. The iced tea had no ice after my first glass (served in a rocks glass from bar) since they were refilling from a carafe that had warm tea in it.  Got to the point of being un-drinkable.  Wife said the calzone was great though, and calamari was great also.  Wait staff and hostess were super helpful and nice."}
{"text":"Went here this past Friday night with a party of 6.  The wait to be seated was well over a hour.  They messed up two of our orders.  One was a Stromboli which they didn't add the bacon to when it was requested.  The other problem was one of the pasta meals wasn't served a house salad when one should have come with.  To make up for their mistake they did take money off the bill.  Once the food did come it was good and the portions are huge."}
{"text":"Worst service I have had in a long time.  Here is the timeline of our eating experience.  Reservation 7:00 Restaurant pushed to 7:15 (no problem) Seated 7:55 Drink orders 8:10 My beverage arrives 8:25 (pretty thirsty) Food arrived for most of our party 9:00 One party members food 9:35 (apology but no compensation) Bread and butter arrives 9:45 (new to me)  Again, service was terrible.  This is unfortunate because the food once it finally came was good my calzone was big enough for 2 and was pretty tasty.  If you can overlook terrible service, the food was good."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! The portions are huge too. I took off a star because we have asked before if they took reservations and they did not, but the last time we tried to bring friends they could not seat us without reservations and the hostesses seemed very confused."}
{"text":"Since the new ownership took over, the food quality has improved.  It is a little on the pricey side for what it is, but you definitely get a good amount of food for the money.  You will likely end up taking home a portion of your meal.      I've had the hoagies and pizza so far and both were excellent.  The hoagies are huge and stuffed with meat and veg and the pizza was so good.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! No problems with waiting for a table, even though the restaurant was very busy at 7pm on a Monday night. We got a table right away, service was excellent, salads were fresh, bread was soft and good. I had the lobster ravioli and the sauce was delicious enough to eat alone. My mom ordered the Chicken Parm and it was delicious but enough for three meals. Great restaurant, nice interior, good for a family or a date. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch here today with a large family group after hearing many good things from friends and family about this location.   Service was excellent and the atmosphere was very nice.   Extremely large portions on the chicken parm, hoagies and sides of fries. The fries actually being large to the point of wasteful.   The Veal Marsala was $24, average portion size and the veal quality was poor being gristle filled and very tough.   Chicken parm was very good in flavor and preparation.   Wedding soup was also very good in flavor and substance.   This could have been a 3-3 1/2 star experience but unfortunately, 5 people in our party suffered stomach pain, diarrhea and nausea within an hour of leaving so we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was great service was even better. I look forward to going back. Very accommodating to large parties. Generous portions for the price and more than willing to work with a person who has a picky order.  Beautiful atmosphere, I look forward to going back."}
