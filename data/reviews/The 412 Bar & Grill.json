{"text":"Fruit flies everywhere at table and in bathroom... food below average... this place used to be awesome bar with great food and low prices.. over priced and food not that good"}
{"text":"Wings are big but not tasty. Service is friendly but not fast. Price is okay but not great. Essentially, a mediocre experience overall. I don't know many bars in the Glenshaw area but I'd assume there are better alternatives. If big, \"you can make a meal out of them\" size wings, are your thing, you want a nice selection of food and adult beverages and you care more about friendliness than prompt service than it's a decent stop, most people want more though so I'd go for an alternative."}
{"text":"I don't get why this place has such a low review. Wings are amazing, drinks are good, staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I usually speak very highly of there wings..good flavor cooked to perfection. Not tonight tho. Horrible. Dry on the outside soft and gooey on the inside. Probably pre cooked and then dropped in to crisp them up. Now i wouldnt normally write a review just because they have had one bad night but the service at this bar is horrible. Asked for condiments when ordered food not brought out. Asked again not brought out asked a third time and still not brought out and i was basically blown off like i was bothering the bartender . Maybe they were out of ketchup and ranch i dont know. Get up from my table to go to the bar and get a refill. Not a bartender in sight.  Im done spending my money at this establishmemt and i would recommend the same to anyone else"}
{"text":"Trying to give them the benefit of the doubt.  Crazy Friday night lights game night, super busy.  Burgers were just ok, no seasoning.  The fries tasted like they came from my microwave.  Wings were dull and had very little sauce.  We would have told someone , but they didn't come around to ask.  Please don't order the pizza with high expectations. Owner was running his ass off  It may be worth a try again."}
