{"text":"As good as it gets! Fresh, tasty, affordable food with quality service. I will drive the extra miles to eat here. Eat lunch or dinner and do a little shopping too. Yummy desserts to try out. A combination plate is around $8. *This is a small restaurant inside BAIZ."}
{"text":"We often come in to get take away inside Baiz Market.  If you haven't tried the garlic sauce you are missing out on life.  Get an entire lb to go with your food, you will thank me later.  If I'm honest the 5* is for the garlic sauce, which I get weekly and eat with everything.   I love running in here for a quick meal ( garlic sauce, hummus plate, fresh feta and olives). So yummy."}
{"text":"This is a great no-frills restaurant set inside Baiz Marketplace. The setup is similar to a food court in that you order at the counter, pick your food up and eat at one of the many tables set aside for seating. It's self serve so you can bus your own table. Aside from quickie inexpensive meals such as flatbreads and meat or veggie pies, they also have cold foods readily available such as hummus, baba ganoush and tabouli. All meats are halal and grass fed which provides for a high quality meal. As for drinks, there's no soda fountain but there's an open refrigerated case with various drinks.  I liked all the variety in the menu. You can choose from several combo platters, sandwiches, and they even had a small section of American-style foods such as burgers and hot dogs. I had the veggie platter ($8.99) and took a few bites of the chicken shawarma plate ($8.99). Both the meat and falafel were made to order and it only took a few minutes for our meals to be ready.   The veggie combo included grape leaves, tabouli, hummus, baba ganoush, falafel, pickled turnips, and came with a large pita. My favorites of the plate were the baba ganoush and the falafel. The slighty smoky baba ganoush had a light natural sweetness from the roasted eggplant and had a lovely balance of flavors. The falafel was so good! I think it's one of the best tasting falafel I've had yet. The filling was so fluffy and light and the spices were perfect. The interplay between soft filling and crunchy crispy crust was excellent. The other elements were more average. The hummus was decent, and while I think the grape leaves are made fresh they were served so cold that the rice had a bit of that refrigerated texture when they turn very hard and starchy.  The chicken shawarma was a generous platter filled with a lot of chicken. I liked the taste of the chicken meat itself but it was a little different flavor-wise than other versions I've had in the past. It was very lightly grilled with light seasoning. The star of the show on this plate was actually the divine garlic sauce. I would come back just for that sauce! It was so ethereal and whipped to a cloudlike consistency with tangy garlic flavor.  The cashier was friendly and prompt. Our total for two meals with two yogurt drinks was a little over $20.  So if you're in the area or are shopping at Baiz and want a bite to eat, this is a good option!"}
