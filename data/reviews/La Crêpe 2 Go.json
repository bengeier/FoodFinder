{"text":"We stumbled on this little tiny place on Rue de Bleury. It is always packed, probably because the ingredients for their crepes are so fresh and plentiful. I went there twice during my visit and ordered the fruitalicious. It was topped with a very generous portion of fruit and the crepe was delicious."}
{"text":"Probably the best find in downtown Montreal during my recent trip.  A very small and quant spot with not a lot of seating but it is a great spot to people watch from the window.  Crepes are perhaps the best way to start a day during a vacation.  My girlfriend and I ate here three times during our trip.  We tried the blueberries and honey crepe, the spinach, egg, cheese and ham crepe, the pear crepe, and the strawberry/nutella crepe.  Every crepe had fresh fruit put on it. Delicious  The business is maintained by two people everyday we walked in and it was the same crew everyday.  I would highly recommend going to this creperie.  It is a local establishment and I will always support these types of businesses over the corporate businesses.    This will definitely be a place that I will miss.    Merci!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite crêpe places in town. The restaurant itself is very small, but if you manage to get a seat it's definitely worth it. I always order the Fruitalicious crêpe and definitely get my money's worth. The owner is very sweet as well."}
{"text":"Crepe on point!  Just the way it is supposed to be. Owner very patient and has great customer service. Will return."}
{"text":"Do NOT miss this little gem. Didn't know if it would be open on Sunday or not but we rolled the dice and went there anyway- luckily it was. Quaint with limited seating but DEFINITELY worth the trip. My little family of 5 didn't leave a morsel on any of their plates. We tried the savory, hearty crepes (ham, spinach, cheese) as well as the sweet ones (Nutella, fruit, etc.)- everything was divine. The old man behind the crepe irons was really cute- he asked us if we wanted to cook our own crepes (pretty sure it was idle chatter but we didn't dare mess them up so we let him do the honors). We will definitely be back (but none-too-soon). Yum!"}
{"text":"Cute little creperie on the ground-level of Rue de Bleury.  It's basically one guy behind a counter making crepes--no frills, nothing elaborate, but they're tasty and pretty cheap.  I stopped in for breakfast and had a spinach and cheese crepe: simple but good.  It came with a side of fruit.  Contrary to what it says on their website, coffee costs extra.  The space itself is small and seats maybe eight people.  A good option if you're looking for a quick and simple meal."}
{"text":"Well.. Only the crepes are gluten free (not the waffles) and oh did they neglect to mention (before they rang my order through on my credit card) that NONE of the sweet crepes - CHOCOLATE & fruit - are gluten free? The owner was very angry at the girl who was at the register .. She didn't know how to cancel my charge - so he very aggressively gave me cash back. Then later in the day when we walked by on our way back to the hotel ... If looks could kill I would be 10 feet under ground right now.   I think the sign in the window translates well \"Sans Gluten Free\""}
{"text":"The best creperie in Montreal!!! This place is so cute, down a couple of steps looking towards the street. There are two tables and a counter along with a few seats up the window. The kitchen is open, so you can watch the owner make the crepes fresh each morning. It's so pleasant watching snow fall while listening to the crepes cook. They do have both sweet and savory ones and they are quite inexpensive. I got their strawberry crepe, which featured fresh strawberries and a little whipped crepe. The flavors were fantastic, not to sweet. We also had an egg and cheese crepe which was yummy and perfect for breakfast. Everything was so fresh and so perfect that even now, back in NY, I'm still craving them."}
{"text":"I just visited Montreal for a couple of nights and while I was there I wanted a real crepe since they just aren't as good in the US. On my last night in Montreal, I met up with a friend who has lived in Montreal his whole life and he recommended La Crepe 2 Go as his favorite crepe place. I am exceptionally glad that he did because La Crepe 2 Go did anything but disappoint. My boyfriend and I went there the following day, our last morning, for breakfast. For starters, La Crepe 2 Go is small, quaint, and a place mostly locals go to. I immediately loved it. We ordered two crepes. One was the traditional crepe with sugar and vanilla that we added bananas and strawberries to, and the other was a spinach, egg and cheese crepe. Both were phenomenal! We couldn't decide which we liked better. The strawberries and bananas were mounded atop the first crepe and the breakfast crepe was FULL of spinach, egg, and cheese and served with a little side of fruit! The owner was absolutely fantastic, and chatted with us about anything and everything while making our crepes. He checked with us a few minutes after we started eating to make sure we liked them. All of the ingredients are bought from a local market so everything is as fresh as it can get. The only thing ordered in bulk is the bananas because of the quantity they go through and the price point. Sure enough, while we were eating, a girl who works there came in to get her re-useable bags, and went to the market. Before we could finish our crepes, she was back with many bags that were FULL of fresh ingredients. I can't say anything better about La Crepe 2 Go!  The next time we go back to Montreal, we already decided that we are having every breakfast at La Crepe 2 Go!"}
{"text":"Non loin de la Place des Arts, quartier où de nombreux festivals et spectacles extérieurs ont lieu l'été, l'on retrouve une toute petite destination dessert aux couleurs vives qui plaît bien aux gens ayant à faire dans les parages. La Crêpe 2 Go, comme le dit si bien son nom, permet autant aux gourmands d'emporter leurs commandes que de manger sur place. La variété n'a rien de très exhaustive, mais les choix demeurent raisonnables et judicieux. Vous y trouverez essentiellement des crêpes repas (oeufs, fromage, épinards, jambon) et desserts (nutella, bananes, fruitées, bleuets, pommes et fromages, etc.) Aussi, quelques paninis (végé, jambon et poulet), des gaufres, de la crème glacée gelato et des smoothies.  Eh bien moi j'ai préféré prendre une gaufre maison aux pépites de chocolat et bananes. J'aurais peut-être dû m'en tenir à une crêpe, car malgré les efforts de présentation et la portion monstre, elle n'a pas su combler mes attentes. L'odeur de ma gaufre en préparation qui embaumait progressivement la place y a été pour quelque chose. Ça sentait franchement bon! Alors je m'attendais à manger une délicieuse gaufre maison faite au moule, saupoudrée de sucre, nappée d'un coulis chocolaté et ensevelie de bananes. Ce fut bien le cas, sauf que le goût et la texture étaient cartonnés (oui, j'ai déjà mangé du carton). Je ne l'ai mangée qu'à moitié, assis au comptoir donnant sur la vitrine, laquelle donne elle-même sur l'inclinaison de la rue Bleury, où d'ailleurs de nombreux passants curieux jettent un coup d'il rapide mais avide, à l'intérieur du commerce (qui est encastré dans le sol). Néanmoins, le café est inclus avec le repas. Ça m'a coûté 10$, et inutile de dire que ça n'en a pas valu la peine.  Certainement pas la gaufre 2 go en tout cas..."}
{"text":"This is a must stop place when visiting Montreal!!!  Forget the hotel breakfast and go to this place.  Amazing service, amazing crape and very inexpensive.  Truly a five start place.  It's your perfect local owned restaurant that is just about good food at a decent price.  The owner kept cleaning the whole time we were here..  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! You walk down into the shop. Crepes were so good. Fresh fruit with my ham and cheese crepe, and a heaping amount of bananas with my choco-banana crepe. Old man making them was humble and nice. The girl checking me out was wonderful, too."}
{"text":"Second Jeanie C. opinions on Crepes 2 Go.  The ingredients are fresh, plentiful, and delicious.  The Chicken Crepes is so fresh and delicious.  The Blueberry Crepres use a special kind of blueberries.  They are tiny and sweet!  The old chef/owner explains that regular blueberries sometimes taste sweet or sour.  Those tiny blueberries constantly taste sweet.  They are specially for cooking purpose!  My son can't finish the Fruitalicious because of its generous portion.  The only disadvantage is its tiny space.  Wait, it's a take-out restaurant!"}
{"text":"The crepes were pretty good but my 4 and 7 year old preferred the ones that I make at home. Service was good though and coffee was above average.  Breakfast for 4 came out to $47 which was  a bit much considering I spent only a fiver more for a killer dinner for four last night at Amelio's."}
{"text":"Excellent crepes.  Using fresh fruits and for those in the mood, lots of nutella.  We had the apple crepe (me), Starter with ham, cheese, egg and spinach (wife) and older son had the fruitacular with lots of fruits.  Younger son had a breakfast panini.  Everything was delicious for a non-heavy breakfast!  Ate here in late July 2015."}
{"text":"This place is so cute an quaint. The gentleman that owns the place is also the one making each crepe by hand. His art and passion is reflected in the delicious delicate crepe.   No frills. Very limited seating. Slow service."}
{"text":"This place is small and has local flavor; a must try when in Montreal.   We visited it this past weekend, after finding it through Yelp, and ended up eating there every morning for the length of our stay.   They serve delicious crepes; I recommend getting the \"starter\" ( eggs, ham, and cheese) along with the jam crepes.   My travel companions enjoyed the strawberry, banana, and Nutella combination, but they are two sweet for me.   To sum it up; excellent food, fresh, and an off the beaten path feel."}
{"text":"This place is the best place for crepes. I was there this morning and I had spinach cheese and egg, my daughter had egg and cheese and my granddaughter had strawberries and Nutella. The fruit was all very fresh and we even tried New Zealand honey dew which is much better than American honey dew. The coffee is also superb and perfect. When we were leaving the cook gave my granddaughter a chocolate marshmallow egg. All in all a great place!"}
{"text":"I was not a crepe fan until today. This was, by far, the best breakfast I have ever had. So glad my hubby found the great reviews here on Yelp that led us to this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I had the starter crepe with egg, ham and cheese. Someone else got the banana, strawberry and Nutella. Both were delicious. Very small place though. Maybe seating for a total of 12 people."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall that has a great selection of both sweet and savory crepes. Tight seating and would fill up quite fast at peak time (we dropped in at around 4 pm). I got a strawberry Nutella crepe, my hubs got a banana Nutella crepe. Both delish! Friendly and quick service. Would definitely come back when I'm the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This cozy spot near the McGill campus was perfect for a quick breakfast after visiting Mt. Royal. Being gluten free, I always have trouble finding food that is safe, and I was very impressed with what La Crepe 2 Go delivered! The cashier was knowledgeable of gluten free offerings and made me feel at ease knowing that my food would be celiac friendly. I got the ham, cheese and spinach crepe. It was delicious! Highly recommend this spot for a quick and delicious crepe in Montreal."}
{"text":"Ugh! SO GOOD! My guy got the nutella & strawberry, I got spinach & cheddar- both were so so so good! Love this little hole-in-the-wall!!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast crepes! Try the blueberry banana with honey and slivered almonds.   Folks here were super nice and delivered our crepes quickly."}
{"text":"Everything I wanted and more. I got the Nutella crepe with strawberry and banana, plus a chocolate drizzle. It was made fresh and fast by the very nice owner. So, so amazing."}
{"text":"Love this place. Tried every crepe (at different times, LOL), and each one was delicious. Friendly, cozy atmosphere in the heart of the city."}
{"text":"Great place for gluten free foodies!!! For the savory crepes he uses Chick pea flour!! He seems to know quite a bit regarding being gluten free because his wife is also gluten free.  We ordered the gluten free Pizza and chicken crepes + a Mango peach banana smoothie!  Everything tasted deliciously Fresh and there was  No preservative taste!"}
{"text":"Fresh and simple crepes that win your heart. Come here if you are homesick and are craving some heartwarming breakfast like your mama made for you. The colourful decor and plates and the owner's geniality will surely make you miss your gran-gran. Crepes are made quick with simple fresh ingredients. I've tasted multiple crepes here and ALL are great.  Recommendation: -blueberry banana almond  -chocolate ones -fruit basket  Coffee is from Union so you'll like/hate it depending on your taste.  This place has varied opening hours; during summer time it's open late but rest of the year it closes by 2pm.  Writing this review is already making me crave some crepe."}
{"text":"You have to go there!! 1. Everything is made from scratch and to order 2. Every single thing tases amazing 3. The owner is super nice and welcoming  We had banana, Nutella and strawberry crepe and the banana Nutella crepe. Simple, yet so delicious! Made right in front of you. Good spot for people watching if you have some extra time .  Seriously, go and have a crepe or two or three or four... because they are that good!"}
{"text":"I thought this was a good place but it was packed and a little crazy. The crepes are thicker than we usually like like 3 star but the smoothies were great 5 star and maybe the fruit crepes are better, we didn't try these. Decent place just not the crispy edge french crepes we were dreaming about."}
{"text":"Crèpes are always good, but here they are amazing!  The perfect amount of ingredients for a well balanced taste.  The crèpe chef very amicably let my daughters invent their own filling, even using an ingredient not on the menu!  The atmosphere is cozy and if you sit at the window, you're right at street level making the people (and dog) watching a fun addition. We'll be back before we leave the city!"}
{"text":"The service is friendly. It's a small, homely place. Great crepes at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I used to live next to here and never would have thought they would make good crepes here because of how the place is situated. It's on the bottom of a building at the corner of sherbrooke and parc. You can see the place from the outside, but to look further in, you would need to crouch. When my friend visited me, she wanted Crepe and dragged me here..Then we kept coming every morning for 3 days straight. This has to be the best crepe I've had! From the ingredients the the entertainment of watching it being made. Every aspect of this place is great! Their portion sizes are pretty decent well. It was hard to sit. But it seemed more like a takeout place anyways. Regardless, these are some seriously good crepes."}
{"text":"It's a one man show in this cute little joint. We were greeted by a display of fresh fruits and giant tubs of Nutella. I would like to bathe in the tubs of Nutella please. Decent selections of savory and sweet crepes with fresh ingredients sliced on site. I had the ham and spinach for savory and strawberry banana for sweet. Both crepes were on the lighter side, I could probably eat 3 in one sitting. Three words: simple, fresh, delicious. I highly recommend this place for your crepe needs!"}
{"text":"We walked out of our way for this place because of the great reviews. It's been a while since I was so disappointed.   We were greeted by a very nice gentleman who took our order. He suggested the chicken for my wife, as it is made fresh and not from a can, like the tuna. I got the ham cheese and spinach crepe. Both could be summed up in one word: bland. So bland that neither of us wanted to waste the calories on it. We ate a polite amount, asked for a box, and gave the box to a homeless person.   I hate to be harsh, mostly because the server was very nice, which is why I'll give it two stars. But I honestly can't understand why this place is so highly rated. Maybe the sweet crepes are better?"}
{"text":"A casual breakfast restaurant to go to, tucked away in a basement at a busy street corner. We stumbled across it because it was right outside our hotel. It had a family restaurant feel and was very welcoming and cozy.  Food wise there were many crepes to choose from, both savoury and sweet. The crepes were finely made, thin, and light. I must say though, that the filling tasted kind of bland and did not melt well with the rest of the crepe; I had the spinach, ham and cheese crepe with a coffee, costing around $10.  Still an overall positive experience though, with great service and atmosphere and very reasonably priced. I would go back to try a breakfast crepe, for the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Literally the worst crepe I have ever eaten. I got the thyme and sesame crepe. It was served with mealy tomatoes. The flavor just was not good. Service was fine but I seriously do not understand the good reviews on this place. These very positive reviews make me think Canadians are too nice to review food accurately. If you want to taste an amazing crepe, try Choupette Creperie and Cafe in New Haven, CT or Creperie Beau Monde in Philadelphia, PA. Both of those are amazing."}
{"text":"Cute little creperie! Delicious crepes, good coffee, and friendly service - what's not to like?"}
{"text":"Very cute little shop with great crepes and affordable prices. Not a bad place to grab a light breakfast or a snack. Staff was also very friendly. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I had a fruitalicious, there was a generous amount of fruit, and the gelato was very tasty; I thought the waffle was a bit too thick and doughy, just a matter of personal preference. It would be nicer if the owner had a helper, he was way too busy sitting people down, taking payment, cooking, and serving food all by himself."}
{"text":"La Crepe 2Go is a lovely little crepe spot right off the busy street of Sherbrooke.  They aren't very big, can maybe fit 15 people total (I counted 3 small tables and then 6 window seats).  It is definitely a warm and snug feeling being here.    The chef is very nice and will let you watch/gawk/stare as he makes the crepes one-by-one.  I ordered the Spinach Egg and Cheese Crepe as it was Sunday brunch, but I also sampled the Tuna Crepe.  Both were very good - I would highly recommend the Spinach Egg and Cheese crepe if you're coming for breakfast/brunch, and the Tuna Crepe is more for lunch/casual dinner.    We chatted with the owner and it looks like expansion into US territory is happening very soon.  They forecast that they will be in Los Angeles some time in 2014 and are looking at locations in New York as well."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and wonderful tasting crepes. Split the ham, egg, and cheese and the strawberry, banana, and Nutella. Cooked to perfection. The guy running the place was as accommodating as could be. Highly recommend this place, even though the construction around the street might chase some customers away."}
{"text":"Had a pretty fantastic breakfast here with friend. Everything was good especially the nutella and and strawberry crepe. I was not a fan of crepes but this can not be compared to the creperies found in back home in New York. Also, the coffee was great as well"}
{"text":"I did search on Yelp where is the best crepe in Montreal, this is come out number 1. And yes, it is 3 mins walk from our hotel. So, I said to my friend ,let try their crepe.   We were there late morning around 10 am. We order ham and cheese crepe , and strawberry banana chocolate crepe.  Food was ok, nothing special or impressive. Restaurant is a bit small, and need to step down to the basement. Decor is nothing, need to improve.   By the way , if anyone come to NYC , try this place for the crepe, \"Delice and Sarrasin\".  This is amazing."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant with fresh ingredients and very yummy crepes!  The service is fast and price range is quiet reasonable!"}
{"text":"Good, sweet crepes. I had the banana, strawberry and Nutella crepes. I ordered 8, and he made it pretty quickly as a one man show. Someone in the reviews said that he doesn't use real Nutella. Yeah, he does. He has tubs of Nutella on the top shelves and the crepes are tasty!"}
{"text":"Thought about giving this place 4 stars but then realized it was only because we had to walk so far from our hotel and had nothing to do with the place or food so revised to 5 stars...   Delicious crepes! Both of our kids had the strawberry banana Nutella and loved them - even considered ordering a second round.  I had the ham spinach and cheese- delicious! Beautiful crepe, great texture and just the right amount of ham, spinach and cheese inside. My husband had the spinach egg cheese and he loved his as well.  The gentleman behind the counter told us he was the owner's husband.  He made us feel at home.  Refilled all of our drinks and chatted with us about the sights and gave us directions when we were ready to leave.  Small place, very cozy and brightly painted. Made for a perfect breakfast! Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Just ate one of the best crepes in this city! First off I went here based on trip advisor & yelp reviews. I don't remember any reviews saying this place is super tiny! Holds maybe 15-20 people packed together! So consider takeout as your option so you don't miss out on this little gem of a place. I want to go back to try their waffles. Back to crepes now-the owner makes his crepe batter perfect; the right amount of thinness, softness & pull to the crepe. I had the \" starter\" crepe which is ham,mozzarella cheese & egg; delicious. My son had the \"Nutella, strawberry\" crepe- excellent! The  owner takes pride in his food & it tastes that way. No frozen crepes here people.  They also have fruit smoothies, waffles & panini sandwiches & gelato on the menu. I would probably give 5 stars but you do have to wait a while because it's only the 1 owner doing everything. But it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is really great. I stopped by for breakfast during a trip up to Montreal for Pouzzafest. I ended up ordering the Choco-Strawberry-Banana Crêpe and I definitely did not regret it. The fruit toppings were nice and fresh and the crêpe was made just the right way. My friends each tried some of the other offerings including the choco-strawberry and a couple of the savory options. All feed back on the food was positive.  The atmosphere of this is place is rather cozy and has a great small breakfast shop feel to it. If I find myself in Montreal again I will assuredly stop by again."}
{"text":"Great little place, friendly owner cooking us our crepes! We had the strawberry banana crepe and it was excellent. Nice fresh fruit."}
{"text":"Quaint little shop halfway under ground, colorful inside. Only two workers when we went. Lots of options, both sweet and savory. My husband got the thyme and sesame seed crepe, which was amazing. I got the spinach and egg crepe. It was quite boring, but the original had cheese on it and I had them hold the cheese, so that's my fault. I'd definitely like to come back for a sweet crepe or perhaps a thyme crepe all for myself :-)"}
{"text":"When I first had the Nutella crepe I knew something was wrong. Goddamn, the Nutella isnt fucking Nutella. Its that selection rip-off stuff and I can taste the difference.   The manager of this place seemed pretty grumpy as well. Saw him openly yell at one of his waitresses which was really unprofessional and left me feeling awkward. Don't understand the grand reviews for this place."}
{"text":"We made our way in here for a morning crepe during our visit and kept it simple. One fromage, one chocolate. They were solid crepes, although the cheese wasn't fully melted and the chocolate was cold. To me, the prices seemed a nip high. The propeitor/waiter/crepe maker was very friendly and quick. With any beverages, this would become a fairly pricey breakfast hit."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I was on vacation from NY and wabted a Gluten free option. The owner was a sweet heart! It tasted wonderful. When I go back to Montreal will definitely go visit again."}
{"text":"This was my breakfast spot during my short visit in Montreal!  The gentleman who runs the shop was super friendly and immediately remembered me when I returned next day morning and quickly struck a brief conversation with me.   The crepes are a good size and I was surprised I finished a whole crepe on my own.  This place is small (3 small tables and 1 breakfast bar seating area) but cozy.  Will visit again when I am in town again."}
{"text":"As a crêpe aficionado, I have to admit that La Crêpe 2 Go is very solid in what they specialize. While none of it blew me out of the water, it sticks true to the recipe for a good, homey crêpe in my opinion - not OD'ing on the fillings, the base being thin and not too sweet, and very fresh fruit toppings should fruit be included.  I got my standard order of the strawberry, banana, and Nutella crêpe. It was served to me very prettily presentation-wise, and it tasted even better than it looked. Since I tend to eat all of the components of my crêpe together, the sweetness of the chocolate combined with the fruit tasted almost like a banana split minus the ice cream. Overall, I liked how the dish wasn't too rich but had the right amount of sweetness to satisfy my sugar cravings.  The interior of C2G itself is pretty tiny, so don't be surprised if you can't find a table or window seat and have to take it on the go. Of course, it shouldn't affect the taste of the crêpe by any means, especially when it is well-made."}
{"text":"This is a great small breakfast option that is perfect for the area.  Crepes made here are done properly.  They come out nice and thin, not greasy or overcooked and burnt.  I've had too many doughy thick crepes and there's nothing more dissapointing, and that wont happen here.  I love the Epinard (Spinach) options and they go great with the ham and cheese for breakfast.  The sweet crepes with Nutella and fruit options are also quite wonderful and not overloaded with too much sugar like most dessert crepes I've had.  Chocolate and strawberry is a perfect combination.  Highly recommended, just wish they had an espresso machine and some better juice options, then we are talking near perfection."}
{"text":"Excellent crepes. Generous with the fruit toppings. Awesome little shop just off the beaten path. Feels authentic."}
{"text":"The best crepe that I had in my life.  We have tried different kinds with my family.  They were all superb!."}
{"text":"La Crepe 2 Go is a small little crepe shop that offers both savory and sweet crepes.  Owned by Monsieur Vartan, this place was one of our most favorites while we were in Montreal!  We tried a Pepperoni Pizza crepe (this was absolutely delicious!  I first thought it would be heavy with the pepperoni and overwhelming with the cheeses; however, it was actually a lighter fare, with fresh slices of pepperoni, sauteed bell peppers, and super fresh slices of ripened tomatoes, topped with some oregano; the crepe itself had a nice little crisp to it, and this was literally both my hubs' and my favorite!), and the Strawberry, Banana, and Nutella crepe (filled with super slices of strawberries, bananas, and the perfect amount of Nutella, this was a nice little finish after the savory crepe).  We also tried their orange Jello, and this was wonderfully-prepared and yummy.  There are some counter seats and a few tables, and I highly recommend in you dining in so you can converse with Monsieur Vartan - he is absolutely hilarious, has a great sense of humor, and is just as sweet as can be!  I highly recommend this place - now I know what a crepe should taste like, and this place is now my official benchmark! :D  +wonderful savory and sweet crepes, fresh made-to-order :D +ask for Monsieur Vartan :D :D :D +some seating available inside +can take crepes to-go"}
{"text":"Decided to grab a quick breakfast to start our day. Fast and efficient service. We were there super early, the gentleman was a tad grumpy, but he sure makes tasty crepes!   Spinach, egg & cheese crepe: balanced savoury crepe  Strawberry & Nutella crepe: delicious  Would come back again"}
{"text":"Nice selection of crepe dishes both sweet and savoury. Good waffle options. Prepare to spend over $10. Cool ambience!"}
{"text":"I think this might have been my very favorite place in Montreal. The only bummer was that Adam was working, so he wasn't able to join me. DAMN, he missed out!!  La Crepe 2 Go is a really charming little spot with amazing, gigantic, beautiful crepes. The restaurant itself is really pretty tiny, only a few seats. If you're there at a busy time you might have to take your Crepe to-go, duh. I went around 2 PM on a Saturday, an hour before closing, and was able to sit at the little bar which looks out onto the street. Nothing better than people watching while eating delicious food!  There are sooo many flavors on the menu, both sweet and savory. I was seriously considering the \"thyme,\" but ultimately decided on the \"apple\" from the sweet menu. Thankfully it wasn't too sweet - it was perfection. A huge fluffy crepe, perfect consistency and thickness, filled to the edge with warm apples and melted cheddar cheese. You gotta know that cheddar + apples is a phenomenal pairing, and with a little cinnamon and cranberries, I couldn't have been happier. A bunch of my favorite flavors all together. I even texted Adam the ingredients and he said, \"that sounds just like you.\" :)  Of course my crepe was gluten free! The chef himself showed me their gluten free flour (Pamela's brand) and told me all about it, and mentioned that he's the only person in the area with a gluten free crepe option. I promise it tastes incredible. The chef and waitress, the only employees in there, were so friendly. I had the best time sitting at the counter with a crepe and a can of coke, hahah. Of course they have coffee as well, but I was craving my beloved coca cola.  I also loved how I could watch the chef make the crepes! The whole restaurant is just one small room with the \"kitchen\" in the center, so you can see everything that's happening. All surfaces were absolutely sparkling clean, and the ingredients so fresh. They didn't even cut up the apple until I ordered. WOO!  Wonderful restaurant with incredible crepes. I would return in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"This place is near to metro, and the crepe is soft,  their food source is also fresh, but it is a little expensive."}
{"text":"What a gem! Tiny little place with delicious crepes! We got the strawberry Nutella and the warm soft crepe mixed with fruity chocolatey hazelnutty toppings really melts in your mouth"}
{"text":"This review is for the savory crêpes. The ham and cheese was not that great really. Nothing special to be honest. It's on the more expensive side. I love crêpes so I always try them everywhere I go and I was disappointed when I left the place.I feel like for the quality they are too expensive and I wouldn't go back again. I guess I'll never experience the same crêpes I had when I was in Paris. Such a shame. I suppose the sweet crêpes might taste better."}
{"text":"Amazing spot! Small cafe wth 5 tables and a counter. Crepes were out of this world. Made fresh and the fruit was hand cut as the crepes cooked. We had the Nutella strawberry, the Nutella strawberry banana and the pear crepes and we're completely satisfied. Worth coming here if you're looking for a genuine crepe experience!"}
{"text":"Montreal's best kept secret.  Go for one of the fruit crepes, some of them with a generous serving of Nutella, you won't be disappointed.  There are other options like omelettes, paninis, as well.  It's a family business not some chain..."}
{"text":"Easy to miss, this little below-ground crêperie is worth keeping an eye out for. With just 3 little tables and a window seat perfect for people-watching, you might have be prepared to take your crêpe to go as the name implies.   We came for breakfast on a rainy Monday summer morning and watched the world go by at foot-level, but when our food came, the world was watching us, to see what we were eating!   Don't be expecting a Starbucks or a patisserie in here. They have savory and sweet crêpes, a few sandwiches, smoothies, and coffee. No pain au chocolat, no Frappucinos.   We ordered 4 crêpes between the two of us! There are photos of all 4. The real standouts were the Thyme (savory) and the Apple Cheese (sweet).  The Thyme was beautifully presented with a sprig of fresh mint and an artful arrangement of sliced tomatoes. The taste was just fantastic. I think the spice used was not dried thyme and sesame seeds, as the menu stated, but rather za'atar; either way it was memorable. The Apple Cheese was a perfect balance of sweet and savory. The apple was slightly cooked, just enough not to taste raw but not so much that it lost its crispness. The cheddar was delicious and didn't overpower the apple, and the cinnamon and cranberries added some pop. The chef told us that they tried several variations on the recipe before perfecting it. They even found a cheese that didn't leave an aftertaste (I can confirm that it didn't!)  I recommend Crêpes to Go to experience an authentic little slice of Montréal!"}
{"text":"This place has decent crepe.  I got the blueberry and banana crepe. It's a healthier alternative to the strawberry Nutella one I wanted to get when I walked by this shop.  The crepe was light, tasty and perfectly balanced with honey and roasted almond. It was a very satisfying dessert for me.  The reason I only gave 4 stars is because they use frozen blueberry and I prefer the crepe to be thicker than what they have now.  However, in general, I would come back for more crepe at this place."}
{"text":"Delicious crepes! I had the Nutella, strawberry and banana crepe to go. The shop is small, so you can watch them make the crepes, which I liked. They are fast, friendly and worth stopping by."}
{"text":"What a great find. Tiny shop where you watch the crepes being made. We had the strawberry banana chocolate, the chocolate, and the banana blueberry. Soo good. We may even go back tomorrow, these were so tasty."}
{"text":"It's good but nothing too special, the crepe does have a little bit more taste than most places but still the toppings take away from it obviously"}
{"text":"La Crêpe 2 Go is a small shop near the McGill Music Building, just off the corner of Sherbrooke and Rue de Bleury. The crepes and coffee are very good.  We were here on a Sunday (it's open on Sunday, contrary to what the write up in Yelp presently says).  Great music (blues) and the guy behind the counter is down to earth. He was talking about setting up an ATM and going cash only because his electronic gizmo is so slow he has almost burned his crepes waiting for it. He is into his crepes.  The prices are very reasonable and the selection of crepes is large. For you Nutella fans, he has buckets of Nutella mounted on the wall.  For sleepy partners, you can get crepes to go."}
{"text":"Lovely little shop, what it lacks in decor it makes up for in spades with its yummy crepes and paninis."}
{"text":"The crepes were delectable and delightful. I've had crepes all of the world, which is why I'm rating four stars and not five because they are not the best I've ever had but they are certainly in the Top 3. I went to La Crêpe 2 Go twice during my 3 day visit to Montreal. Each visit I ordered the Nutella crepe with strawberries and bananas. I think I would have preferred the crepe more if I had just ordered a Nutella crepe with bananas as strawberries aren't exactly at their peak quality this time of year (they were a bit sour and I prefer them to be sweet). The crepes are handmade and the service is quick. The shop is so cute and was just a short walk from the hotel I was staying at. I highly recommend stopping at this shop if you are in Montreal! I would return here for a 3rd visit."}
{"text":"La Crepe 2 Go has a really cozy feel. I ordered the 'fruitalicious' crepe, and I was surprised at how much fruit they give you - variety and quantity! Their crepes are really good. It's also nice because you can tell they care about their customers just by how they treat you.   If you have a sweet tooth, I'd suggest getting one of their crepes with nutella! But if you love fruit, you can't go wrong with the fruitalicious crepe."}
{"text":"favorite one, surprised me every time. Starter and choco-strawberry are great choices. Surprise is great too!"}
{"text":"This place is everything a creperie should not be. I wonder how they manage to make such badly tasting basic crepes. I also tried their ham panini and it was filled with old looking vegetables and a load of green olives that overpowered the whole sandwich. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Extremely happy with the is choice for breakfast during my stay in Montreal. So good I came back the rest of my stay.   As some who allergic to gluten and corn, it is usually difficult for me to find places where I can eat without compromising. No compromise here. Full flavor. Full menu options  Chick pea crepes for regular food items, rice based crepe for sweets.   Quaint environment. Staff is super friendly and kind. Food was served fairly quickly. Great if you like mom and pop shops. Not a bad thing to say. Only good."}
{"text":"We had 5 hours in Montreal and were hoping to enjoy some crepes (and a gluten free crepe too!). We stumbled upon this place while walking around the beautiful city and I am so glad we did! We arrived about 30 minutes before closing and ordered 6 different crepes - each one just as beautiful as it was delicious. The service was wonderful and the owner was incredibly friendly. This Arizona girl will be craving those crepes for a long time!"}
{"text":"I ordered the crepes with nutella and strawberries and it was honestly so good. And I love the place as well, it's small yet cozy. My new go to breakfast place because it's so close to my house and pretty cheap for such delicious crepes."}
{"text":"I had the blueberry/banana crepe.  My daughter had the Nutella/banana crepe and my wife had the apple/fromage crepe.  Watching the owner make the crepe was fun.  He made it look so easy.  Overall, all our crepes were really good.  They were the right consistency and filled with generous portions of our toppings."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in all of Montreal. Amazing gluten free crepes and the man who runs the place is a sweet man. He always remembers me as \"gluten-free girl.\" I love the nutella strawberry crepe. Super filling and great price. If you want a crepe, go here!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh and good. But a little expensive for me. Around 7 dollar for a basic classic crepe"}
{"text":"They take MasterCard :) The staff is attentive and nice. The crepes are made fresh in front of you. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Cute spot, lots of options, great food! Crêpes were delicious and the servers were super nice! The atmosphere inside was adorable and very welcoming, this could not have been a better start to my day!!"}
{"text":"Tucked away on Rue de Bleury, you'd almost miss La Crepe 2 Go if you didn't see the faded red door and pale yellow sign or if you didn't have the nose of K9. My beau and I stand eagerly at the corner of Sherbrooke to cross over to Rue de Bleury and I can already smell deliciousness and scream like a fan girl \"I smell CREPE!\" We're both excited and clearly look like two tourist fools, but we don't care and neither does anyone else because we are all way too hot to care on this blistering hot summer day.  We pass by and the window is not at eye level because it's almost \"underneath\" typical store level. We open the door savagely only to be greeted with a line of people wanting crepes as eagerly as we do. I look around and think \"wow, this place is tiny\".   It's cozy and does the job and really adds character to the little nook it prides itself in being . I turn to my left and pour myself a cup of water from the cold pitcher that patiently awaits new visitors. The line took no more than 3 minutes and we  finally seat ourselves at the bar. Thankfully, we took the last two spots. Aside from the bar that houses about 6-8 hungry bodies, there are 2-3 small tables to the left of you when you walk in. Not much space to sit in but there is a take out option if WORST comes to worst.  We got both a sweet and a savory crepe.  Pizza crepe which was loaded with two types of cheese, pepperoni, red peppers, olives, fresh tomatoes and oregano. It was mouthwatering and one of the best things I ever ate.  I, of course couldn't deny my sweet tooth and love affair with Nutella and went with the Nutella and Banana crepe. The Nutella literally melted in my mouth with every bite because of how warm and fresh the crepe was. Loaded with fresh bananas and a drizzle of chocolate sauce and dusted lightly with icing powder, I felt at that very moment, that my life was complete.  We devoured our crepes within minutes, I mean, I practically inhaled mine. Overall I give La Crepe 2 Go 4.5 stars out of 5. If the place had more seating and wasn't as snug, it would certainly get the full 5 stars from me but since YELP doesn't have half star options they will get a full 5 from me.  :)"}
{"text":"Only one complaint: it should close later!  This little breakfast place is sweet and so sweet! Service is very kind! I guessed that encountered the owner who made my breakfast. The prices are really fair! You get big portions of sugary food! Nutella pots everywhere!!! The wait is not very long. Also, there are not that many seats but for the low number of customers when I visited, shouldn't be a problem at all! There are many choices! Keep in mind that it's a small breakfast place, so it may not have the capability to make every dish! Happened to me, he couldn't execute an order I wanted because there wasn't enough ingredient, but it's quite all right! He suggested me another one which was really enjoyable!"}
{"text":"What a great find! My family and I were staying around the corner on Sherbrooke. This place is small, but don't let the size fool you. The crepes were outstanding! Fresh crepes and fresh fruit. Delicious!"}
{"text":"No complaints.  We all loved our crepes, both savory (ham, egg, cheese and spinach) and sweet ( banana and Nutella).  It is a very small place, but we found it to be very charming and the service friendly. The owner/crepe maker took great care with each crepe. It was like watching a craftsman.  We went back two mornings in a row. On the second, his helper was late and we snuck in just before a large group of what appeared to be summer campers. He handled them as well as could be expected and everyone seemed happy to wait, knowing it would pay off.   And like another reviewer, my wife raved about the coffee.   We don't know when we will be back in Montreal, but when we are, we will be back."}
{"text":"We had a ham and cheese crepe as well as a Nutella, strawberry, and banana one, and they were great.  The crepe was tasty and chewy, as well as the fillings.  Each crepe also came with a since sized portion of fresh fruit.  Worth a try if you are looking for a crepe near downtown."}
{"text":"This place was good! Interior is pretty sparse, just a small window bar to sit at. Crepes weren't a revelation but got the job done and were tasty enough. We got the ham / cheese / egg, spinach / cheese, and Nutella-banana-strawberry crepes. The savory ones all came with a small slice of watermelon, cantaloupe and pineapple. Server was very pleasant. Chef glared at us wordlessly for most of our stay, either because we were American, or because he could tell by our auras we were from Boston."}
{"text":"Just as the reviews described, this was worth the 20 minute walk from our hotel The coffee was the best of all the spots we tried in Montreal and the crepes were our top favorites too We had the spinach, cheese and ham and dessert Nutella crepes with strawberries, ohhlala!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on our way to Parc du Mont-Royal and thought it was just ok. Crepe itself was a bit chewy. Filling was on the sparse side. It was a good morning snack but unfortunately don't think I'd eat another one of these."}
