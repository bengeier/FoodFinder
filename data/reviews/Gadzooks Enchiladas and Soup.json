{"text":"Wow, I didn't expect the food to be this good. Call me cynical, because I didn't think that a place called Gadzooks would make such good Mexican food. I had the enchiladas with the beef short ribs and tried the spicy potato corn chowder soup and it was delicious!!  Parking can be a little stressful if you show up during lunchtime, but I was able to find a spot right away during the noon rush. 

I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We got deliver from Postmates. The speed of deliver and ha selling of the food was fine. The food, on the other hand, was ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!!
The flavors were bad, there was no texture, everything was mush, and it was ridiculously overpriced for what it was. 

FOOD WAS TOTALLY GROSS!!!"}
{"text":"Christmas came early!!! 

Walked by today and decided to stroll on in and check it out. GREAT decision. Unbelievable service from the top down. Happy to have an establishment with owners like this in my neighborhood. And the food?? DELICIOUS (and gluten-free options). Im confident everything on the menu is tasty. We'll be frequenting this joint often. Can't wait to try more of their options!  

Thanks for the great experience and service!"}
{"text":"Awesome enchiladas. Guacamole was great. Sangria and margaritas were great. Can't complain about anything. Super authentic and yummy!"}
{"text":"Enchiladas are smoking hot. The beef is very tasty and I love you go online to order your food and choose all your toppings. But be careful some toppings are not free. Overall is so Delicious."}
{"text":"First timer and I loved it. I had nachos (so amazing), my boyfriend had the enchiladas (so amazing too) and def will return. Also met the owner super down to earth and polite. 10/10 forsure."}
{"text":"The Godfather, Terminator, Toy Story, Gadzooks..... believe it or not all of these things have something in common. The sequel is just as good as the original. I have been in love with the Ladas that have been pumped out on the corner of 7th st and Osborn for years. When I heard that a second location was happening I sat... I waited.... my anticipation was growing like it was the 4th of July and the next Will Smith movie was debuting. 
 
Finally it arrived, aaaaaaaand SHOW TIME!!!
 
The first thing I noticed about the new Gadzooks was location, location location, right on the canal on Camelback and 40th st. So why not take a bike ride down there?! The feel was very similar to the original Gadzooks location and I saw many similar faces behind the counter, which was refreshing, because I knew that my lada (*spoiler alert, I didn't get a lada) would match the consistency that I have expected from this establishment. As I step up to the line I notice right in front of me a Beer handle from Wren House, a great local brewer. I asked for a beer expecting it to be poured and delivered at the end of my production that will be my meal. But NO... the employee poured the beer and handed it to me as we started!!!! What a great idea, now I get to enjoy a drink as I make my way down this line.

Back to the spoiler, and one of the main reasons I am writing this review. I have heard rumors about a Taco, a taco so good that Humpback whales have been known to migrate down the canal of Phoenix just to get a taste. \"The Festival Taco\". Chicken, corn bread, slaw, cotija cheese, jalapeno ranch.... so simple..... so amazing. You can tell that no corners have been cut in the making of all of Gadzooks creations. The consistency of freshness, and overall product that they produce will keep me coming back over and over again. I am Glad to see that even in the second location no attention to detail was lost and they continue to produce hits.
**Redefining the Enchilada..... and now Tacos**"}
{"text":"Gadzooks is always delicious and the new location is as nice and clean as the PHX one, if not nicer. I went with a friend on a weekday and they were a bit slow, full staff but they seemed a bit out of it. The food was still delicious but we did have a 10 min or so wait to order. I had the short rib for the first time ever, it was delicious and smoky. For the other enchilada I went with my tried and true jack potatoes, cover in green salsa and cheese, plus more salsa and cheese."}
{"text":"Don't accidentally get out of line after you pay (you know, like you do at every other assembly line style restaurant). The server will get PISSED. Also, not good for people with Celiac. Enchiladas were ok, but not worth dealing with angry servers."}
{"text":"Ordered my food to-go, but I can't even imagine how much better it would taste if I ate it when it was hot, fresh out of the wood fired oven!

Gadzooks is an assembly line style of fast casual, delicious enchiladas and tacos.

Their tortillas are thick and chewy, I had the 50/50 corn and flour tortillas which, I think, is the key to these enchiladas. 

As for fillings, I got three enchiladas: 1 with braised short ribs, 1 with pork shoulder, and 1 with cornbread. 
I opted for the Christmas sauce (Half green sauce, half red sauce) and asadero cheese topped on my enchiladas before they went straight to the wood fired oven. 
Once removed, you get to choose the toppings for your beautiful, colorful, warm enchiladas. They have just enough salsas and toppings to choose from without being too overwhelming. Their arbol and Habanero salsas are nice and spicy! 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone with an enchilada craving. The enchiladas are stuffed, cheesy, gooey, warm, mouth watering goodness."}
{"text":"Ordered braised short rib enchiladas with red sauce. It was 6:30pm and I was the only customer at the Camelback location. Not sure if the girl that took my order is new or just lackadaisical but I had to repeat my order three times, asked for an egg over easy, didn't happen, asked for limes for my iced tea, that didn't happen either.  The meat was really dry and had zero flavor, sauce wasn't much better.  Not overly impressed, would try again with different selections next time and probably go to the original location.  Cookies were just ok as well.."}
{"text":"3/5 for food and 1/5 for service. I think that, because of all the amazing reviews, we were expecting to be blown away, but our experience was pretty mediocre here. 

As some other reviewers have mentioned, the line is long and the portions aren't very big. The service was what killed it for us, though. I couldn't hear half of what the workers were saying (the restaurant was really loud and they didn't make any effort to speak up), and they didn't explain anything, even though it was fairly obvious that we'd never been there before. They also talk to you from way down the counter, asking you questions about the food before you can see what they're talking about, so we were really confused. I feel like we would have liked the food we got more if we had been able to make choices while we were actually looking at the food in question. The girl working at the cash register was nice, and took the time to clarify some things we were wondering about. 

When we got to the salsa/dressing section, we asked several questions about which salsas were spicier than others, etc., and the guy working there just said, \"I don't know, I haven't tried them,\" and left it at that. He didn't offer to let us sample them or anything, he just kept looking at us until we blindly picked one. He also didn't give us enough salsa (half of a small cup) for the chip order, and my salad had the same amount of dressing, so it was dry.

As for the food itself, we got short rib enchiladas (Christmas style) on 100% corn tortillas (they also have a 50% corn & 50% flour option), a chopped salad with pork shoulder, and chips & salsa. The short ribs were juicy and decent, but somewhat lacking in flavor. The enchilada sauces paired really well together, and they didn't skimp on the cheese, so that was nice. The pork shoulder in the salad was the more flavorful meat, and I really enjoyed it. It was probably my favorite part of the food. The pickled onions are really good, but make sure to ask for extra, because they don't give much. As for the rest of the salad, the slaw and lettuce were left bland because there wasn't enough dressing. I would've liked pico, but the salsa guy just looked at me when I asked for it twice, and we had already had a weird experience with him, so I just moved on. I didn't feel like the salad was worth the price, because it just didn't have enough in it. The chips were really good and fresh, but the salsa experience was lacking - we didn't love the one we chose, and we had no guidance at all as to what would have been better.

Overall, this didn't turn out to be the new favorite we were hoping for. We'll probably give it another try on a day where it isn't so busy now that we understand the ordering process better, and hope for better service. So far, though, we haven't found anything \"crave-worthy\" in the food here, and the service definitely leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"Definitely one of Phoenix's culinary Crown Jewels. It's a convenient  location and a welcome addition to the original. Has been going to the original ever since it opened. We take people from out of town on a consistent basis, and there are always requests to return. I have also seen them used for catering, the food translates very well to a catering format. Went by the new location recently, just as good as the Original. The \"festival tacos\" are not to be missed. But The classic enchiladas are out of this world. Unique fun toppings, avocado Crema, pickled onions, great salsas, etc. I hear that someone is up at about 430 every morning braising the various meats, it shows in the quality. Glad there are 2 locations now!"}
{"text":"Great food and extremely nice/helpful staff. If you get there during rush hour, it may take a little while but just before that you get to order and your food right away. I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Food is flavorful but the portions are small. The enchiladas are about the size of street tacos. They have a variety of meat and vegetarian fillings plus a good variety of sauces."}
{"text":"New take on enchiladas. So many options that its a little hard to decide.  The nachos with rib beef and mash potatoes covered by cheese and roasted was delish.  The enchiladas were okay but I think it was just wrong choices on my part, i.e. the spinach and mushrooms as a filling sounded good but gets overwhelmed by the sauce - for my taste.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I had Gadzooks for breakfast. I ordered the tortilla soup with chicken tomatillo with shredded cheese and green salsa. Delicious! I will be back."}
{"text":"Just gave this new location a try. Had two enchiladas Christmas style with cheese and fresh crema. Had salsa and coke slaw added to the top after they came out of the oven (they cook it in like a pizza oven right in front of you). Had two different meats on the two enchiladas. Dish is served at the counter (very casual) piping hot! Will go back!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the 7th Street location for years and was so pumped Gadzooks was coming to my neighborhood.  Without fail, they're turning out the best enchiladas around at this location, too.  I'm there more than a couple times a week getting my fix.  The quality is repeated and the atmosphere is awesome.  I'm not sure how they do it but the flavor is so unique and I'm usually taking leftovers home with the portion sizes.  I'll definitely be back...maybe tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Really liked the enchiladas at gadzooks. Very similar to chipotle but with higher quality ingredients in my opinion. Ordered the pork shoulder and short rib. Topped it off with a red and green combo. Had a little sauce but I was able to tolerate it. Will def be coming back"}
{"text":"Standing in line for forty-five minutes and paying $13 for two enchiladas and a soda pop to go sounds a little outrageous and cannot be an every-day thing, but it's certainly a delicious treat.

I'm pleased they have a vegan option to begin with. It's a spinach mushroom sauté, with corn flour tortillas (some of the best I've ever had), and green sauce. The allergen menu isn't completely labeled, as they forgot to add it on a few items.  I added all the salsas and the deliciously pickled red onions. 

I half expected it to be dry based off of how long it took to pay for my food and wait to dress it. I think that the wait is a little too long right now to be a good lunch spot (45 minutes for two people to go through the line) but eventually it will die down and they'll find a better groove for the flow. It was a bit of a mess paying for my food before putting on the toppings? What if someone changes their mind and wants something on top that costs extra? 

My gripe is the amount food I got for the price. One thing that will cause me to go to chipotle over going here is the lack of free quac for a vegan enchilada. No cheese and no meat and I still have to pay $2 for quac? No thanks. Make the vegan potatoes an option during a week and I'd understand a little more."}
{"text":"Love Gadzooks. We kept coming so often that eventually I said that I would go someplace else. Try the chicken with cornbread enchiladas. Oro grapefruit margarita. So many different combinations. Love the nachos. Anyone can be happy here, vegan, vegetarian, dairy free. Gluten free. Can't wait to bring my out of town family here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. My husband and I both enjoyed the spicy cornbread enchiladas. He also liked the tomatillo chicken enchiladas. Lots of fun fancy toppings and great adult beverage selection. Plenty of seating. We can't get enough of Gadzooks!"}
{"text":"I would describe this place as \"Chipotle\" of enchiladas.. You make choices of what goes on your enchiladas from the scratch made corn or flour tortillas, endless options of meat or non meat toppings and finishing toppings. I was impressed that the tortillas where being hand pressed at my order. They  have \"50/50\" tortilla (half corn/half flour) which was good choice with the meat fillings to hold against the sauce that goes on top. There are so many fillings to choose from and you can choose two different meats. After my enchiladas were filled they were placed in wood fire oven to toast up a little bit. I would caution on putting too many salsas on top as it gets little soggy but have fun and explore the different options. Overall I was very pleased with the quality of food and will spread the word about this new place in area."}
{"text":"Love their jalapeno cornbread enchiladas with the Christmas sauce. $8 for 2 enchiladas is a pretty good deal considering the location. They also have bison as a special item and is worth trying as well"}
{"text":"Our food was inedible-it was so hot (Chile hot). We were told (by the staff )the green sauce was mild...it was not. The entire family had to throw their food out because it was so hot. We really wanted to like this place since it's in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This location flows so much better than the original location on 7th! Everyone was friendly and accommodating. The architecture is modern and fits great with the neighborhood!

The food is fast casual, picking each ingredient and topping as you go. Make sure to get a friend egg in top if your enchiladas! The chicken tortilla soup is more like a stew and is heavenly. 

Every day they do a speciality meat, but it's limited so you have to show up early! It's worth it. 

Great vegetarian options as well."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!  So glad they opened up there 2nd location. You have to try their short rib tacos. Some of the best food around the valley."}
{"text":"Gadzooks consistently has the best tortilla soup and enchiladas in town. The new location on Camelback is quickly training up a new crew, the line is moving well. For me, this is serious comfort food well worth the drive from Scottsdale (as is the original location). Plenitude of options here for a tasty meal and you can make it as spicy as you can stand or as mild as you need.  Try the cornbread for a sweet and spicy treat."}
{"text":"I am so happy this place opened up in Arcadia.  i had been to the downtown location (which is just as great as this one, just hated the drive). I got the short rib and chicken enchiladas with a fried egg on top. This place is known to have some of the BEST enchiladas in town. The interior is clean and modern and the staff were helpful and kind and very quick. HIGHLY recommend getting the fried egg on top. i saw that they have street tacos as well so ill be coming back for that. :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this restaurant and then they opened a new location on camelback and their service there was so poor. We were in a short line and the service took about an hour to get our food. It was so ridiculous and then they were out of corn tortillas so my mom ending up getting nothing. Not worth it. Cornbread is also getting spicer and spicer which I don't like too"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious!! I will be dreaming of the pumpkin brown sugar glaze cookies and the bison!"}
{"text":"I like the Gadzook's food, but ironically (for a soup place) this particular location channels too much of the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld for my like.  This is particularly true with large groups, of which my family (6) is constantly one.  Mostly the ordering process is relatively painful for groups - lots of choices but one at a time - and I thin the staff in turn are constantly stressed out.  I gave this location a second chance, and it was about the same as the first, with a particular worker asking with my 10 year old child 3 times with considerable annoyance to hurry up and because she was holding up the line.  Frankly she wasn't holding it up, because everything else was still queued up and there were only 2 new arrivals behind my party, but they have an inefficient amount of space to work with, and the lines can just blow out of control here in a heart beat.  First time we came in on a Sunday there was actually a crowd and we had almost a 30 minute wait to get through line, so I can imagine they must be standing on pins and needles behind the counter constantly worrying about whether its going off the rails.  But for $10 meals, I don't need to get in a fight or have my fairly sensitive kid harangued by adults."}
{"text":"Good food! Horrible service! They are always sooo slow..... This place is always busy - slow service doesn't help much! ?"}
{"text":"I had the street tacos with cornbread and potato. It seemed as though the cornbread and the potatoes had a ton of oil or butter???  I wish I had ordered the chicken or the soup. The chips and guacamole were very good. For meat eaters, it looked very tasty.  I ordered three street tacos, but I didn't need to, one would have been fine. There was a line to order. People were excited to be there. Many were regulars. It is set up sort of like Chipotle. I think my family will enjoy this place for a quick dinner. Next time I order, I will try to order something without so much fat."}
{"text":"Yeah!! A second location closer to my house!  Food is amazing! 

Love this place... New building is spectacular!  Well done guys!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! the cornbread stuffing is the BEST ever! I love Gadzooks."}
{"text":"This place is super delicious! My boyfriend and I get the street tacos and they're great but they got soggy pretty quick so they can't travel far if you order to-go. 

We've come here a few times in the last couple weeks because it just opened and I live in the neighborhood. We love the staff except for the short brunette with short curly hair, she's been rude and disrespectful every time. Idk what her deal is but she's not welcoming. She accused us of trying to steal another customers order after we paid our $40 order. I don't understand because the other associate had just put all of the fillings on our tacos and then the short brunette started packing them up and was grilling us about how many tacos we got. I let the first rude interaction go but four attempts going back later and she's still just as rude...I understand a bad day but that's just bad service. I hesitate to go anymore because I literally don't want to see her and deal with her attitude...I just want tacos."}
{"text":"After 30 minutes standing in line we were finally asked what we wanted to order. The server had on gloves, took cash and then rubbed his face and hands with the gloves still on before asking what we wanted. 
Once we ordered three people behind us had there food remade we were told and so ours sat idly while they made theirs. We got our food but they forgot half of it then begrudgingly gave us the rest of our food. We sat down and ate this one note, no real flavor slop of an enchilada. We are One and Done!  Awful food!!!!  Horrible service. Maybe there should be someone over the age of 16 managing the incompetence on a Saturday night. Don't eat here!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere! Friendly staff and seriously delicious enchiladas, tacos, and really everything on those heavenly 50/50 tortillas. Couldn't recommend it more!"}
{"text":"I'm being generous here. I thought the food was good and I really liked the meat options. I found it to be loud inside and that's fine but none of the girls were helpful. They expected you to know how to order and they had very soft tones. I thought they'd have more soup options and made it easier to order. The experience could have been better if I knew what my options were and how to order. I thought it was good over all, just disorganized and loud and no one taking the helm."}
{"text":"Great place to come for lunch and get some Mexican comfort food.  This was my first visit to this location.  Despite the tight parking situation, it was a very good experience.

I went with two enchiladas. I like their 1/2 flour and 1/2 corn tortillas that they make fresh to order.  The short rib and pork fillings were excellent.  Once you add cheese, salsa and sauces you've got a tasty meal for a fair price."}
{"text":"Yum! Our first visit to this newly opened gem in the neighborhood was great! It was busy so you had to wait in line for a bit but one of the staff came around with menus to pass out and ask if we had any questions. The food is very tasty and you can customize it the way you want it. Watching them make the home made tortillas, you know you are in for good food. The grapefruit margaritas are very tasty as well. I look forward to visiting this restaurant again soon to try something different."}
{"text":"Love this place! Have been here about 5 times since it opened and i love the short  rib enchilada and corn bread enchilada. Amaze!"}
{"text":"OMG.... sooooo good!!!  Impressive but a bit confusing on the assembly line for a first timer but the food was delicious.  Amazing guacamole, short ribs and the carnitas.... soooo good.  Such a nice addition to the neighborhood!!!"}
{"text":"Congrats on your new location! I had a wonderful experience here! Everyone greeted me with smiling faces from the moment I walked in!  The enchiladas are out of this world crazy delicious! (My favorite thing to eat)! Fresh and hot right out of the oven! Your staff was extremely helpful and friendly, which made my experience the best I could have asked for! Thank you Gadzooks!! You're just what Arizona needed!!! Kudos!!!"}
{"text":"So I originally heard of the Gadzooks in the downtown area off of 7th, this location is in the arcadia district  recently opened 3 months ago. Can't miss is as its just east of 40th st and camelback road. The invention of a enchilada pick as you create your enchiladas similar to chipotle is ideal! They do also serve tacos, salads and soups! 
Since it was my first visit had to go with the staple flour enchiladas with chicken and barbacoa(short rib). Once you select the tortilla, select the meat, then any topping mixed with a select cheese that then gets put into an oven for a quick bake. The end product is melted cheese with fresh flavors inside. They also have two style of margarita drink machines and a variety of Mexican beers. I went with a grapefruit margarita and unsweetened ice tea. Can't wait to visit next and try our the other varieties of meats and cheeses they have to offer !"}
{"text":"If you love salt with an undying passion, then Gadzooks is nirvana for you! I am fond of salt. But not this much salt. In fact, we used the chips as foils for the incredibly salty enchiladas. If you know anything about chips, then you know that their main properties are crunchiness and salt. And the chips at Gadzooks are no exception. So good. The best thing we ate there. But especially because they were a \"neutral\" and less salty flavor compared to the insane salt-bomb of everything else. To the managers I say, please, please stop with the salt. This place is gorgeous. We watched it being built all year. Arcadia is happy to have you. (But we here are a health-loving bunch-even if we're eating enchiladas!) The view of the sunset is gorgeous from here. But we can't go back. It was just too salty. I'm not a negative reviewer normally but c'mon, this was insane! I want to keep typing but my fingers are swelling from the salt so I'll have to stop here."}
{"text":"Food was really good, a bit on the expensive side but over all very good. It's very difficult to hear what they are saying on the other side because of the glass which I haven't had issues with at other places but oh well. It was a little busy and to be expected since they recently opened. 
One of the gals that works here (the one from Minnesota) was absolutely fantastic. She handed us our menu when we got there and explained everything, and after we sat down to eat she was doing something else and came by to see how everything was. She was personable, knowledgeable and working hard."}
{"text":"Great food. 

Too loud. Can't hear the Servers (check in w Chipotle & see how they did their acoustics).
Maybe label glass to show types of meat / sauce, as you can't hear the server.  

More Bike parking for canal biking access."}
{"text":"The service and food was great.  I got two enchiladas, one braised short rib and green Chile pork shoulder with corn/flour tortillas.  Both meets were great, but if I had to choose one it would be the braised short rib.  The toppings were great as well.  I really like the honey slaw and cream.  The lady that helped us was nice, the place was clean.  The chips and guacamole were very good too.  It is also very affordable. My wife and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing tasty lunch for family and my gluetien free member.  Habinero sauce  on my pork enchilada and then a tasty chop salid ."}
{"text":"Amazing food and people!  First time here and Candace was there to greet us with an amazing positive attitude and walked us through the menu and answered all of our questions!  Top notch service!"}
{"text":"Feel like the portions are a little bit smaller than the store in downtown Phoenix. But still it's yummy in my tummy and in my neighborhood. It beats the bill down the street!"}
{"text":"Usually when a brand says they are \"redefining\" something it's a lot of marketing speak garbage and their product is no different than anything else. So when I saw \"redefining the enchilada\" on the exterior wall of Gadzooks I was skeptical. But these guys are not messing around. I've never had enchiladas like this before!

My husband and I stopped in on a Sunday night for dinner. My first impression was that it's kinda like Chipotle for enchiladas. You pick out what you want as you go down the line. First time in of course we had to go with enchiladas, although you could get tacos or a salad or soup. I went with the 50/50 tortillas (half corn, half flour) and short rib in one, combo of chicken and cornbread in the other. Red sauce and jack cheese on top. The do not skimp on ingredients. The enchiladas were stuffed and they put a ton of sauce and cheese on top. 

Into the oven they go and then you wait for a couple minutes. I added crema to mine after (because why not?). 

First bite. OMG. So much flavor. Everything just blended together so well into a meaty, cheese, saucy mess of goodness. The cornbread is outstanding. Next time I'm gonna get one that's just all cornbread! And two enchiladas was plenty. We were both full after we stuffed our faces. 

I really enjoyed this place and will definitely go back. I hope they open up a few more locations!"}
{"text":"Sooo good! I love enchiladas and they made a place for enchilada lovers!! I got a chicken/cornbread(loved) + a beef/potato enchilada with both red/green sauce & all the toppings. Hubs got the pork/spinach red sauce, he would have done with the spinach. Their portions are very generous and I liked the green sauce better than the red mole sauce. Their chips & salsa is very tasty as well. Fun hip vibe with good music selection & friendly service."}
{"text":"So glad this location FINALLY opened! I've been going to their other restaurant on Osborn for years and the enchiladas and nachos and breakfast tacos (OH MY) are now dangerously close to me. I've been twice to the Camelback location and MAN it's been super busy each time but let me tell you - it's well worth the wait! Pro tip: order nachos to-go and eat them on your couch. Welcome to the neighborhood, Gadzooks!!"}
{"text":"Something I'd like to add to my original review (please make sure to read that as well) is that in my most recent visit, they had a new guy working the toppings area. After paying for everything (including $1.65 for guacamole) I moved over to him. I asked for the guacamole and he gave me something like half a teaspoon, which he carefully scooped from the container. I had to ask for a little more about 5 times until I just gave up and took my food (at this point I probably had less than a tablespoon).

I've never had problems here like this before, but this was kind of pathetic. I assume it's just a lack of training seeing as he seemed very new, but I still felt it should be addressed.


On another note, in the time since I first ate here and wrote my original review, I began eating meat again after a long time. Having now nearly all of the fillings, I have to say they're fantastic. 

Through all of this I have discovered that all of their meatless fillings (smashed jack potato, spinach mushroom, and cornbread) are not vegan as far as I can tell, which is unfortunate considering it would be fairly easy to make a vegan friendly filling to accommodate their many vegan options."}
{"text":"I have met the owners I work across the street and they are great people which shows in the food and the restaurant and how it is run. The flavor is there many vegetation options which I love and many different sauce choices. I love sauce! I love being able to choose just what you want. Great place too the patio is great and I love that they have a walk up window. Check it out. There are 2 locations I've been to both and they are consistent."}
{"text":"I love this place. So many options for an enchilada! Tasty food, fast service! Their salads are great, too! Basically a Chipotle type place for enchiladas."}
{"text":"If you like Chipotle, this is the place for you. I like the concept of an enchilada restaurant, but it's not for me. Not authentic at all and is Americanized for sure."}
{"text":"Customers stand in line and choose what they want on their orders.  Takes a lot of time just standing.  The food was not good and certainly not worth the wait in line.  Truly disappointed as this place to close to home and we were hoping for something better."}
{"text":"So we didn't know this when we got in line- but it was their soft opening. So it took over an hour to get our food. Candice was absolutely great and got the manager involved. 

The food was really good. I didn't much care for the read sauce. It's so customizable that you can get whatever you want. The margs and sangria are definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"The food was sooo good.   The short rib filling in the enchilada was my choice. This was my first visit. The make these to order.  Very fresh ingredients.  Plenty of employees. They serve coke products.  2 enchiladas for 8. You can add a 3rd for 3.  2 is plenty for anyone. Next time I may add 1 and split with my wife. One in our party got the nachos, they looked great.  We got the cookies, they are link in, made on site. Excellent.
On top of everything they serve coke products my fav."}
{"text":"Not even close to Mexican food. Disgusting American enchilada with powerful sauce. Expect heartburn."}
{"text":"I love getting the bison or beef and then topped Christmas style with asadero cheese. I can't skip the cornbread or potatoes, so I usually get those on the side. What's great about Gadzooks is it's extremely high quality food for a great price. Everything is made from scratch down to the tortillas. I adore this place, it's special to me and special to Phoenix.

I will say, I've had better customer service at the Osborn location than the Camelback location."}
{"text":"First experience was great! Tonight was not good. Everything was extremely salty and had to eat my tacos with a fork. Staff seemed very clueless and wasn't listening to what we were asking. Concept is for sure a five star. Love the idea. Love the ingredients. Has great potential. Might try again in the future"}
{"text":"So HAPPY we have Gadzooks in our neighborhood!!   What a great space and the food is delicious. The best enchiladas and gauacmole I have had in Arizona.   It just opened and we have been there twice already.  So many great items to choose from and everything is fresh and super tasty!   The staff is very friendly and helpful.   Especially Candice who is there to greet you with smile and very eager to answer questions and guide you through the menu.   How great is that?!   Not many places go the extra mile to have someone greet you and help you make the best choice for your meal~ especially someone as personable and friendly as Candice.   Walk~ Ride your Bike~ or Drive to Gadzooks!  You will be very happy you did."}
{"text":"This place is less busy than the 7th st location every time I've gone. The food is great and they seem to have streamlined the food ordering process a bit more than 7th st. Chicken enchiladas with red sauce is my go to. Just wish they had some nutrition info around. Oh well, I probably don't want to know!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best enchiladas and best fast casual food you will find in all of Arizona. These guys knocked their second restaurant out of the park with new and fun little detailed changes from the first place. The food is stellar as always, and its truly likely the best pulled chicken, short ribs and pork that you will find in the city. Whether you are there for a dinner or lunch, they always greet you with a smile and do everything they can to make it a great meal experience. 

Can't get enough of those award winning festival tacos!"}
{"text":"Love Gadzooks but this new location needs to figure out how to cook the eggs. Both my egg and my wife's egg were not done over easy (see picture). Overall a good experience with a friendly staff."}
{"text":"It's the best. Everything is fresh and well made. So for the cornbread if they haven't run out. And don't forget about the soups. Very friendly staff also."}
{"text":"Well, okay.  So I broke one of my cardinal rules about new restaurants.  Why not break the other?

Normally, I like to wait a few months after a restaurant opens to give them a chance to work out the kinks, but this time, my daughter insisted we go, so we did.  I also don't normally write a review after only one visit.  However, Gadzooks is worthy.

I was a bit unsure about going here, as I've been watching their construction progress for almost a year, anticipating an unannounced opening.  Well, I guess they did it, and opened about a week ago.  We rolled in about 6:00pm on a Thursday and they were doing a steady business.  Clearly the management knows how to start up a restaurant, as the line appeared to be staffed with seasoned, experienced people.  Everybody was calm, there was no confusion, panicking or running around.  People moved through the line quickly and efficiently.  This concept is a \"build your own\" enchilada or taco.  You start with freshly-made-before-your-eyes tortillas in a heavy stoneware dish.  You fill it with your choice of a variety of meat/vegetarian fillings, add a sauce, some cheese, and it goes into the oven for achieving a cheesy/melty/crispy consistency.  Moving through the line, you order beverages from a fine selection of Mexican beers, margaritas or sodas.  Then you add the garnishes like salsa, house-made crema, cotija, and a variety of spicy sauces.

You can eat there or take away.  We chose to dine on the patio, which was a bit noisy, being next to Camelback road, but we were able to carry on a normal conversation.  I had the 50/50 flour/corn tortilla, with a green-chile pork filling, green sauce and cheese.  garnished with cotija and crema, the presentation made for a tasty-looking treat.  It tasted as good as it looked.  I would have preferred a bit more spice in the green-chile, but that's just me.  Daughter had potato filling, and I got a taste of that.  Everything was clearly fresh-made and quite delicious. 

For me, Gadzooks is a welcome addition to my neighborhood and I look forward to leisurely bike rides up to the canal for a tasty dinner."}
{"text":"I literally just finished Gadzooks and ran to write my review. I was so excited to try this place as it was right next to my house and had a cool looking building. The location is great and the interior was fun/trendy. To my surprise I walked in and noticed it was chipotle style (embarrassed to refer to chipotle in this review because it blows chipotle out of the water). 

To start, the girl cooking the tortillas knows what she is doing, she was friendly, fun, and extremely knowledgeable. The tortilla was so fresh and crisp that made you want to just get an extra one on the side to eat.  The rest of the staff was seasoned and excellent as well, they explained everything and were smiling while doing it! I was shocked at the customer service at this place and will keep coming for the food and the service.

I got three enchiladas: pork shoulder, chicken/cornbread, and braised short ribs - literally excellent... I probably wouldn't get the chicken again and just do the cornbread... the pork shoulder and braised short ribs were outstanding. 

Excellent job to this staff and owner. Welcome to the neighborhood!!!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent as was the service. The prices are a good value based on how great their food is.  I'll be back for more"}
{"text":"Was excited to stop by this place for the first time.  3.5 stars.  A lot of options as you go through the order.  While I appreciate the concept which is similar to Chipotle, you sacrifice freshness a bit.  The chicken enchiladas with red sauce were fairly tasty overall.   Wouldn't mind coming here for a quick bit if I'm craving an enchilada or taco, but won't be rushing here on a consistent basis."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! We come here EVERY week. The potato enchiladas are a must! Their margaritas are pretty good and their pumpkin cookies are delicious! Great spot for a quick and delicious dinner!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with family. Great options, portion size is perfect, and good atmosphere. I will be back again to bring friends."}
{"text":"Went in today for lunch and had a blast, a gentleman greeted us at the door and let us know that they were still not officially opened and that they were working with the employees to get them familiar with the kitchen and the process.  The employees were friendly and seemed to be working through any trepidation with the soft opening process. There were lots of options available, and we figured out they would let us taste anything we wanted,  Everyone ended up with great tasting enchiladas, and being able to pay while the order cooked, really alleviated some of the dead time. I am rooting for this place and looking forward to coming back in 2018!"}
{"text":"Holy fuck-a-roonies. That's all. Yelp is making me write more, but that 1st sentance says it all. Blah blah blah whatever. Eat here. You're an idiot if you don't. Eat here!"}
{"text":"Amazing food can't wait to come back for more !! I didn't think I was going to like the food, but OH MY!!!! The only criticism is they don't have beef enchiladas"}
{"text":"So good!! 
At first I had my reservations about eating at a place that makes fast enchiladas, but Oh was I WRONG!! 
This place was delicious, fast and nothing what I had expected. We definitely will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"The food is superb as I expected knowing their reputation. They're definitely working out the logistics of the place and the staff is very clearly new, which is to be expected at a Brand new location. I followed some recommendations from other reviews and was very satisfied with the chicken and short rib enchiladas. The sangria was tremendous and the Wren House taps were a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Excellent service and really tasty chow.  I recommend you try the award winning taco but eat it there or right away when you get home."}
{"text":"The place was clean and for the most part the employees were real nice. However the one girl taking the meat order, I had to repeat what I wanted 3 times to her and it just wasn't me. So be ready to yell it out. 
I ordered the enchiladas which came in a small dish. The food was well presented. I had what they called enchiladas. I'm not use to chili being made this way. The red chili was powdered chili and tasted plain.  I couldn't taste the chili at all in the green chili. They do have all kind of side sauces you can pour over your dish.   So I did not care for the chili at all.  For two of us sharing a soda the cost was around $22.00  I don't know if I would consider this real Mexican Food."}
{"text":"Here we go. A new restaurant and it's not half bad. Let's start with the good stuff. The staff is friendly and and the presentation of the food is great given it's a quick casual restaurant. Generally I thought the food was good. But OMG on the saltiness. If they tone that down, I'd give this place four stars. Even at three, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Super yummy!! Tried the short rib taco with the honey slaw and the carnitas taco with the pickled onions. Side of guacamole and chips and was too stuffed to finish it. My coworker got the enchiladas with carnitas and tomatillo sauce, he ate every bite. Love the name and the food. Think a cross between authentic Mexican and chipotle. High quality, good flavors and quick service! Yummm!"}
{"text":"Great food, staff, and beer! Wren house on tap!  Make sure to try the festival taco. NOM NOM NOM."}
{"text":"Great quality and tasting food, good atmosphere, and helpful/friendly staff. I'd recommend for anyone looking to eat quick, casual Mexican food."}
{"text":"Definitely the WHOLE ENCHILADA!  Since you can customize your order you can address all of your dietary needs. We had the roasted tomatillo chicken, green chile pork and the smashed jack potato. I think the creamy potato was my favorite. Lots of complimentary toppings to cool off or add crunch to your zesty Enchiladas. They have lots of other options to include tacos, soup, nachos. An added bonus, they open early so you can satisfy your cravings in the morning and beat the lunch rush!"}
{"text":"Festival taco all the way! This location is awesome, a+ to their real estate agent or whoever is responsible for this spot because we love the canal access! The food here is so fresh for being so quick and reasonable"}
{"text":"Always a great place to come and get some food! They're cornbread enchiladas are amazing! I definitely recommend along with some of the pickled onions!"}
{"text":"Finally went, pkg wasn't as bad as I expected & food was as good as orig location. Arch & flow is well done & others concepts in area should take notice. Well done!"}
