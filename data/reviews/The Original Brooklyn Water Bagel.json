{"text":"Great breakfast sandwiches on a toasted bagel. I'm also a fan of the iced Cubsta coffee with the iced cubes made with coffee so it doesn't get watered down. You can customize your coffee, which I love. My only wish is that they had a size smaller than the 24oz."}
{"text":"Closest I've found to NJ/NY bagels in Charlotte area.. Bagels are pretty great, had a sausage egg and cheese and it was delicious.  A little neater (fluffy scrambled egg) and less greasy than a true Brooklyn bagel,but that's really not a complaint and I guess that's the Charlotte touch ."}
{"text":"Best bagel breakfast sandwiches in the Ballantine area. Good selection of flavored coffee."}
{"text":"I stopped in the other day with my entourage of devastatingly good looking friends and  of course my awe inspiringly good looking girlfriend. So naturally when we entered everything came to a screeching halt. A few women audibly gasped as I approached the counter and a grown man began to weep as my gang of filthy bagel hungry sluts sauntered bye.  I'm from NY originally, and you know how annoyingly snobbish we can be about our food. Probably most painfully arrogant about our pizza, and also bagels. I know I am at least. I suffered through a few bagel experiences in Florida that bordered on that scene from The Marathon Man....you know which one you coy little devil.  This place knocked my proverbial socks off son! I kid you not kid, this was legit NY style bagels, not even forgetting the obscene amount of cream cheese. I was also pleasantly surprised to see the Honeymooners playing on the TV. (Went home and pirated the series that night....shhhhh.)  Great food, and a friendly staff! I felt sort of bad for the poor girl who was making bagels behind the window. I felt like I was at the Zoo and she looked pretty uncomfortable back there. Also there was a mildly creepy old guy whose shorts were way to short. I mean why the hell should I have to look at that before I even have coffee? I expect them to fix this immediately."}
{"text":"These are just  as good as our favorite bagels in NYC!!  We are so happy to have great bagels in the area...finally!"}
{"text":"Stopped by again for another try. This time they didn't have any plain \"cold\" bagels, only right out of the oven bagels. This makes for a messy, melty cream cheese sandwich. C'mon guys, I really want this place to work, how do you run out of plain bagels.  Again, it all tasted great but its not what most people want."}
{"text":"Not a New Yorker but raised on Bethesda Bagels in Maryland. Tried OBWB today and played it safe with a 3 bagel in a bag to go purchase at 1 pm ( they close at 3pm). The bagel making was done for the day. I got onion, cinn- raisin, and poppyseed bagels. No extras. After opening my bag my onion bagel was covered in burnt onion chips. It smelled like burnt onions so I asked for a replacement and got one that was clearly smaller but only 1/8 burnt onions on it.  These bagels were extremely hard to chew! Toasting actually makes them slightly easier to chew. But the next day when I cut into the poppyseed bagel I found at least three large air pockets in the Bagel. Really? If you have never had authentic bagels made in a Kosher deli then you might not realize the difference. The staff member changed my burnt onion bagel for another one but clearly had no comment as in \"oh I apologize for that\". The owner or manager needs to be there at all times. Doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"OOF!  Do NOT waste your time if you're a native 5-borough + Long Island kind of New Yorker.  This place has... NO GRIDDLE!!!  If you like \"microwaved liquid eggs\" with bacon bits, this is your joint.  As a Massapequan, I did what I had to do, and threw my breakfast in the garbage.  You're welcome!"}
{"text":"NYer here.. This is far far far from a Brooklyn water bagel. We got egg sandwiches with bacon and cheese. It was inedible. Microwaved eggs with cheese that wasn't melted. The bacon was uncooked. The bagel was rock hard. My husband who eats anything threw his out too. We won't return."}
{"text":"I absolutely love these bagels . They are fresh, fresh (REAL) eggs, and they don't skimp on anything! Much better then Einstein! The canarsie (don't know if that's how it's spelled) cubsta is even better than Starbucks. I LOVE that they have simple syrup and flavoring you add to the coffee yourself. I also recommend the chicken salad bagel. Everyone there is also really nice and helpful :)"}
{"text":"The bagel was so hard it was impossible to eat our bagel sandwiches this morning. My daughter got the raspberry lemonade and she didn't like it at all. No lemonade taste, way too much raspberry. Big let down since our last visit was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! After moving out of NJ 8 years ago, we've had a hard time finding great bagels and had to settle for places like Brueggar's or Einstein's, which were average at best.   I keep getting their everything bagel, which is outstanding! I order it 'double-toasted' with their scallion cream cheese. I have also had their egg sandwich, and my husband loves their egg salad.  Not only does The Original Brooklyn Water Bagel Co have incredible tasting bagels, but their pastries are so fresh & delicious! My husband loves black & white cookies and this place is his new favorite. I'm not usually a fan of black & white cookies, but I LOVE these and end up eating half of his cookie! The muffins are great too - so tasty and fresh.  In addition to delicious food, the staff here is great! They are friendly, helpful and always make us feel welcomed! We've been there about 5 times in the past 2 weeks and will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 star because it does what so many others have failed. Deliver consistent and quick breakfast sandwiches. Their ice coffee is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Holding pizza and bagels close to my heart as a former Yankee.. This place blows away all expectations. I got one of their staple breakfast sandwiches and WOW! Tons of flavor from the bagel, perfect amount of chewiness. Only negatives I can find about this place is the noticeable lack of seating during busy hours, and mediocre coffee. Those things are not enough to keep me away from this place by any stretch, though. Amazing job bringing NY to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I work in the Ballantyne corporate complex across the street so occasionally stop in on my way to the office. I LOVE the bagels! Have tried several and have never been disappointed.   I gave 2 stars for the staff...there is one guy in particular (young ish, tall, dark hair and beard), who makes me extremely uncomfortable every time I come here. I can understand trying to be friendly, but this guy is intrusive and misogynistic. One time I went in and he started to ask how my day was, then proceed to ask if I had kids, if I was married, and how old I was...In what world is it okay to ask a woman those questions out of the blue? While she's trying to pick up bagels?! To make it worse, he calls me sweetheart which I think is completely inappropriate..Without fail, every time he is at the register he makes comments like this that make me so uncomfortable I don't want to come back.   It's a shame that I have to deal with such a negative service experience from a place that has such delicious bagels..."}
{"text":"I don't get all the good reviews...this place is nothing special. Their bagel sandwiches are extremely dry and very bland. The iced coffee was poorly made. I could get the exact same thing at a dunkin. They really should consider adding some flavor and maybe some extra training."}
{"text":"Best Bagels in Ballantyne!!!!! You can't get chocolate chip bagels here. Kids are disappointed about that, but they love the chocolate chip muffins and the parking there is okay. The staff is nice there and I will be back"}
{"text":"Great NY style bagels! Coffee is great as well. They provide simple syrup for the iced coffee so it will mix better than sugar granules. And the ice cubes in it are made with coffee so you get more coffee as they melt!"}
{"text":"Importing the water is big but somehow these bagels miss the mark. I am from up North and these bagels are not even close! Are they good? Their okay but not the bomb that some make it out to be. Go and enjoy by all means but you have not found the holy gmail here."}
{"text":"This place was nice. They are obsessed with their water and they have a huge potion of the place set up to make the water just like it is in NY. I'm not sure if it is a good thing or a bad thing because the bagels are so so. But, this a place worth going to."}
{"text":"A gimmick for Southerners! The bagels are overpriced and hard. Save your money and hit Bagel Bin down the road, they don't need \"Brooklyn Water\" to make a better bagel. Don't expect them to last long. Bad location and high rent will be their downfall."}
{"text":"Best bagel shop in south Charlotte.  Love the black Russian bagels.  Open on Sunday mornings, love it. We need more of that around here. Black and white cookies are big and great to share. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Love the bagels. The service is great.  Coffee not so great but I hear that the ice coffee is good."}
{"text":"The bagels are absolutely incredible. Not to mention the staff is always so friendly and nice. We love this place. Also, the iced coffee is my favorite. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Brooklyn Bagels has now reached 5 stars. Management has continued to eliminate the little annoyances. The bagel Sunday was top notch.  Coffee very good also. Plus the staff is friendly and diverse -- what you'd expect in a big city.  If you've not been by recently, try it again. Think you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"I need to start by saying I've never eaten here; this review is based on a conversation I had with my father today. Dad moved here 7 years ago from Long Island, NY; and he hates it here. He hates everything about Charlotte, the Carolina's and the south. He complains regularly about everything and anything and in 7 years, and has *literally* never liked anything he has tried here. Until today. He goes to all the restaurants that advertise they have NY Style anything, and is always disappointed. Until today. Today, Dad had a bagel from this shop, and loved it. He used words like exceptional and excellent and was genuinely happy and excited about the bagel. It's the first time in 7 years he's liked anything he's tried. I can only take this to mean the bagels are beyond authentic, and taste like bagels from NY. If dad likes these bagels, I'm certain you will too."}
{"text":"Love this place. We come all the time for the breakfast. My favorite is Asiago bagel. Kids love the juice choice. They serve coffee with twist. Try their ice coffee. You will enjoy making that."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, short wait time, and great quality bagels. I got a breakfast sandwhich with spinach, egg whites, and mushrooms. So yummy. I forget the name of it, but it was 5.19. I thought it was pricey but they truly pack on the fixings! I couldn't even eat the whole thing! I like that it has a NY vibe (my home state)...kinda loud and busy, but awesome food. I enjoy seeing them make the bagels (they have a little window you can peak into where someone is working). The workers were super friendly and kind. They even walk your order around the counter to hand to you--great personal touch! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"These are the one of the best bagles I have tasted. I have read some reviews and don't know what some of these people are talking about. I live in Brooklyn and have had bad bagles in Brooklyn these are are better then some of the bagles I have had in Brooklyn. Wake up people these are great and I know i am from Brooklyn and a New Yorker,  not like some of you that don't know what good bagles or food taste like. Coffee good great staff , all baked and fresh just what a New Yorker wants , We know we have the best bagles  and pizza in the world."}
{"text":"A++++ for the south. And iced coffee ice cubes makes it extra special ."}
{"text":"I may have been expecting too much. Went in for breakfast with the fam....all of us missing being able to have a good NY breakfast sandwich....bacon egg and cheese on a toasted bagel. Line was crazy long...but a good bagel spot is well worth it.... We tried 5 different bagels (plain had a 15 min wait); all very good...but not worth the wait in my opinion ....BUT the eggs, bacon, sausage, etc were all garbage....I asked for the typical salt pepper ketchup and the lady pointed to an area with packets ....I've had better at a gas station, and did I mention it was over 40$ with coffee? Go for the bagels, take them home and prepare yourself....but don't go thinking you'll be able to get a traditional NY breakfast sandwich because you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwhich place in Charlotte! They pile on the eggs and meat and the bagels and huge! The place is always hopping and well worth it!"}
{"text":"Seriously LOVED this place!! I got an asiago bagel with egg, bacon, tomato and a side of veggie cream cheese. It was warm and delicious. The service was wonderful and the cashier Kim was super friendly! They have frozen coffee ice cubes for your iced coffee so it doesn't get watery (genius) and the Brooklyn Infused brew was perfectly sweet. I will definitely be visiting again!!!"}
{"text":"Great bagels!  Biggest difference is the people. The manager really sets the stage, knows customers names, greets people and ensures orders are delivered well and meeting customers expectations. The team is terrific and Jason is the Maestro at making a great sandwich and providing service!"}
{"text":"I stopped in Saturday afternoon for a light lunch. After chatting to the staff I decided to go with the roasted turkey on an everything bagel (double toasted) and the Canarsie Concoction.   The bagel was very tasty! It's a nice size with a great crispy crust and tons of flavor. The heaping portion of roasted turkey was a nice treat and I loved that condiments are all self served. I added some deli mustard and my sandwich was so tasty!  I'd definitely get this again!  The Canarsie Concoction was fan-freaking-tastic!!!!! The coffee beans are roasted with kahlua, vanilla and caramel flavoring. The ice cubes are made from coffee and are a delicious treat once all your coffee is gone. Per the suggestion of the staff, always use the sweet syrup...never the sugar packets! Totally worth it! Oh and if you need more flavor they have self serve hazelnut, vanilla and caramel creamer!   I'd come back sooner if it was closer to my side of town! But I'll definitely looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I came here with Kelly C. when Pete made such an impression on how awesome this bagel place is, we just had to try it out.   A bit of a back story, my husband's family are all from New York, Brooklyn mostly, and Queens. Brooklyn water is kind of a mythical creature. Unless you've had it, you don't really know how to comprehend just how good it is, you only hear of stories how people bottle it, ship it, bring it back to NC, because the water here just does not compare. They've always said someone should market Brooklyn water and make a business out of it.   Well guess what? Someone finally did.   Aside from awesomely awesome bagels and sandwiches. Which are totally bargain priced. And huge black and white cookies (like dinner plate huge & for $2.50??!!??). They have a soda fountain for egg cremes and lots of mixing. I love mixing my own cherry sodas, and creating new concoctions.   They also have a water tank in the back. If you're looking for the story, ask an employee. They will explain how they take Charlotte water and make it Brooklyn water. How they then use that water in the bagels, and the soda fountain, and pretty much everything else they do. They call it \"Brooklynized\" water.   So please. All of the people who decided to move to NC from NY. Even those who are not. Do yourself a favor and visit this place. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I'm a huge fan! I was always curious about this place. I mean seriously, a place that ships their water from Brooklyn to make bagels? Only problem was I worked uptown but with a new job in Ballantyne I remembered that this place was nearby.  The bagels are any northerners dream. Sure they don't have the 30 bagel flavors you might want but they have all the essentials and they make them well. They add everything on their everything bagel just like they should, including salt. They extra toast my bagel making it crispy without burning it. When I ask for a light amount of cream cheese, I get just that... A light amount! The cherry on top is the customer service. Both time my service has been beyond expectations in terms of friendless. The bagels are done as fast as they possibly could be. Bravo, yall are doing it right! Best bagels I have had in Charlotte to date."}
{"text":"As a transplant from theNY/NJ area, I am jaded when it comes to bagels. BWB plays up the Brooklyn water concept more than it needs to since the bagels speak for themselves. Their Coffee is meh, but the bagels are the best I've had in south Charlotte. I drive past several bagel stores just to get here for my bagel fix."}
{"text":"Sadly, this place has lost it's mojo and lost me as a customer. A few years ago, I ate here three times a week. I loved the decor and it was comfortable and friendly. But the decor was changed and a couple of the bosses left and it just is not the same. And these days, the couple of times I have gone there, it was empty."}
{"text":"Okay so I understand that this is the holy grail for displaced New Yorker's but this southern girl loves it also.  I'll let ya'll eat my biscuits and gravy and drink my sweet tea if you let me eat your bagels and drink your Brooklyn coffee. Only thing that I ask is, please say hello, hold the door and smile at others- it's how we do it down here :-)  I have tried the Asiago bagel with veggie cream cheese and the Staten Island with egg white, spinach and mushrooms. Love them both!"}
{"text":"Found this place because I had an intense craving for some smoked salmon and an everything bagel.  This place definitely did not let me down. I throughly enjoyed my breakfast! The warm, gracious service we received was just the smear on the bagel. Hehehe.  I have never been to a bagel shop which provided so much visibility to the back of the house. I was equal parts captivated and impressed to see folks in the back rolling and proofing the dough. So cool. Not sure what gave their bagels more cred, the viewing window or the fact that they everything both sides of the bagel, which is absolutely essential, but not always guaranteed! The coffee was also very good as well. You could just tell these folks took a certain amount of pride in what they do.   My only slight qualms were the use of farmed smoked salmon and the seemingly previously frozen hashbrown cake.  Seriously folks, these bagels are so good, we ordered 6 to-go on Saturday and they only made it to Monday (wish I could claim there were more than 2 of us). Loved the pumpernickel too!"}
{"text":"These bagels were HORRIBLE. I am from NJ and these don't even compare. They don't even make fried eggs, they heat them up in the microwave. The staff was clueless! Brueggers makes a better bagel than this place and that's not saying a lot. Even the coffee was horrible. Just because you put BROOKLYN in the title doesn't mean it will be good. Huge disappointment"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. I go here as often as I can, the staff is so friendly and I love a place where people start to remember the \"regulars\" names. It makes a connection with the customers and the staff. The bagels are the best, I ALWAYS encourage others to start coming here rather than Bruggers and etc. The bagels are always worth the price and the black and white cookie is delicious! My favorite is the bacon egg and cheese on Asiago toasted or Asiago toasted with cream cheese, tomatoes and bacon. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Okay I'm starting a campaign to name BWB to have the best iced coffee in Charlotte. Ice cubes made of coffee - no watering down. And if that is not enuf, the 50% extra caffeine coffee gets my engines going in high gear!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit so my review will be \"a tale of two cities\". We dined \"in\" on our first visit ordering breakfast sandwiches. The first was an everything sandwich including fluffy eggs, ham & beacon and cheese. Messy to eat but very tasty. My Bride ordered the egg, beacon and cheese bagel, hold the cheese. Needles to say, the special order stumped the chef because it came with the unwanted cheese. The mistake was promptly corrected. The bagels were fresh and tasty!  Second visit was a take out order of of three different bagels. The Asiago Cheese bagel tasted more like American cheese and the bagel was underdeveloped; more like a doughnut. The cinnamon raisin bagel was equally underdeveloped and lacked a hint of cinnamon. The third was a wheat bagel and it consistently met the others...under developed.   Not sure if it's the simulated \"Brooklyn\" water or a bad chef day but the bagels today were pretty lousy.  Not likely to return as Poppy's Bagels reflect the NY we remember!"}
{"text":"This is reminiscent of the bagel shops in NY that I would frequent with my family. Fresh made bagels, egg sandwiches, muffins and a drink bar stocked with Fox's u-bet syrups. Instructions to make your own egg cream or cherry coke.   We took a while to decide, since my little girl couldn't decide between a muffin or bagel, but the employee was friendly and helpful. We ordered a sesame bagel with plain cream cheese, coffee, chocolate chip Their bagels were crisp and chewy. Perfect combination in my book. While we were eating, there was a flood of customers and each was helped quickly and efficiently. .  We will be back to try the different varieties of bagels. Hopefully it will be soon!"}
{"text":"Worst costumer service ever!!!! The attitude was so bad and at the same time rude!!! And the sad thing is that I ordered to go!! I don't imagine eating there!!! WORST STAFF EVER!!!  Bagels great! But I'm not coming back!!!! I prefer going to Einstein bros bagels!!!   Pero servicio al cliente!! La actitud fue malisima y súper grosera!!! Y lo más triste es que solo era una simple orden para llevar!! No me imagino comer ahí!!! El PEOR PERSONAL!!!  Buenos bagels, Pero no regresare!! Prefiero ir a Einstein bros bagels"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot in Charlotte.  Being a NYer I'm picky about my bagels and coffee.  This place gets everything right!!!  The best part of Brooklyn Water is the staff!!  They are so friendly and accommodating.  If you're ever in the Ballantyne area stop in for a true NY breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Three times food to go, three times order is wrong. The latest, no cream cheese on our salmon bagels (really), kind of like no tires on a car. Side of bacon....forgotten. by the time you get home and open your bag who wants to drive back. Food is good,  only if I can actually get it!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start.... I'll tell you a short story...  As a NY'er I go back at least once a year, if not twice. Although I've never been to Brooklyn (before you judge... I feel like EVERYTHING I need is in Manhattan) I get my breakfast bagel sammiches in the downstairs deli from my Aunt's apt. on the Upper West Side. I discovered the plain bagel with plain cream cheese, tomatoes and bacon on a warm sunny day about 10 or more years ago as I needed to break a $100 bill from my Aunt and needed something in my stomach before I caught the two buses to get to LaGuardia Airport (we all know airport food is expensive as sh*t).   That bagel sammich was like warm love in my mouth. I've never had anything made so quick and taste so good in the morning. So good even my Aunt got hooked on it. When I took my husband there for the first time, he got hooked.   Well fast forward to getting back to NC. I've tried Brueggers, Einsteins... I've even tried knock of \"NY\" bagel shops and none have been able to pull off what BWB pulled off today... All these shops make you feel like you got taken advantage of; paying around $6-$7 for a sammich with thinnest layer of cream cheese, ONE slice of tomato and a couple strips of bacon. I mean WTF dude. I guess people keep going back either because that's the only option or because they don't know any better. BWB pulled off what I thought was the impossible in NC...   A nice thick layer of cream cheese, not one but TWO slices of tomatoes, and some crumbled bacon; all on a REAL Asiago bagel. I'm told Einsteins and Brueggers freeze their bagels. No wonder why they taste weird. Not to mention my bagel this morning weighed at least 1 lb. NOW THAT'S A NY BAGEL!   Big ups to BWB for bringing my fave NY bagel sammich to the South! Chea!"}
{"text":"Love the place, bagels were so good, and I love the black and white cookie! What you also got to try is the U-bet egg cream."}
{"text":"Good authentic little NY style Bagel joint. Bagels are huge, loaded with eggs (when ordered) and are a great value. The place has always been packed the mornings that I have been there. Excellent coffee selection too."}
{"text":"What happened???? So sad this place closed! Our favorite!!!! Please tell us that it will come back? We just can't drive to Atlanta for it. :("}
{"text":"This company claims to have Brooklyn style bagels. I will admit, that they are some of the best bagels I have tried in the are, especially because the everything bagel is truly an everything bagel, but they are not brooklyn bagels. Their cream cheese selection is sub-par, and they don't even have lox. Great place to go for a bagel when you're craving one, but not exactly what they claim to be!"}
{"text":"SO happy to have a great, quick bagel place nearby! Growing up in NY I've missed great bagels living in MN for a couple of years, and these definitely hit the spot. Yes, there is a wait sometimes, and yes sometimes they run out of bagels, but that's to be expected. I also love the muffins and need to grab a black and white cookie next time I'm in!"}
{"text":"Best bagels in Charlotte.  Very busy as expected and friendly  staff. Brooklyn water I guess really makes a difference. I drank the water as well and it tasted like spring water. The coffee was better than some coffee shops."}
{"text":"Wow it's really hit or miss here. Came in about 2 or 3 times since last review,  and presentation was much better, got exactly what I ordered.  But just came in again, Monday March 21, 2016 about 12:45, and ordered the same thing, but got only partial coverage with cream cheese and the lox could have been spread out to cover but was stacked. Wish they were more consistent."}
{"text":"Best NY bagels in the area by far. Tastes most like the better bagels in NYC.  Crisp exterior with a chewy, hint of sweetness interior. Always go here for your bagel fix."}
{"text":"The staff is delightful. Everyone is always smiling and asking you what they can get for you. My friend and I usually sit outside which is nice because we can bring the pups along too.   I love the fact that the everything bagel is coated top and bottom so there is no favorite side. I like to ask for mine double toasted, one time in the toaster never seems like enough for me."}
{"text":"Best bagels in Charlotte. As a German I'm a bread snob but these bagels are a good substitute for German rolls."}
{"text":"I love this place. As you can see from my check-ins, and the way that the cook has my sandwich ready before I'm even done ordering... I'm a regular.  The staff is super friendly and helpful, always happy to see customers, and remembers specifics - like my dog's name, or that I get \"extra bacon, extra crispy.\" Let me tell you, I've created the perfect sandwich here, and while it takes me forever to order it - it's delicious every time. The only draw back to this place is that they microwave their eggs, making them crazy fluffy, and some of it will fall out of your sandwich. The coffee is fresh, cold or hot. And they have COFFEE ICE CUBES. That's right! No more melted, watery coffee for you!   You can sit inside, and chat with the regulars (mostly Italian New Yorker transplants, my favorite!) or you can sit outside, where you'll usually find me, my dog, my friend and her dog (my dog's friend) and chat with us.   See you soon."}
{"text":"I would be a regular if I lived near by.  My pumpernickel wasn't as soft as the poppy one, but had better flavor.  Very nice, outgoing staff.  Fun place to be."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  Every time I walk in the door they staff is always friendly and attentive.  The store is always clean.  Food comes out fast and delicious.. I get the bacon egg and cheese on blueberry bagel.  The only bad thing I can say is that the blueberry bagel is seasonal.  Great place to enjoy breakfast inside of outside. Go and enjoy."}
{"text":"Although the particular sandwich I ordered with lox, heavy cream cheese, tomatoes, red onions,  add capers (.29) on a sesame bagel was a little spendy  at almost $12, it was a masterpiece! The lox had some nice smoke, veggies fresh and cream cheese light and fluffy. I detest bready amateur bagels. THESE WERE AWESOME!! The bagel itself was crispy on the outside, soft but not bready just like they are intended to be. Yum! The bagels alone are priced right and worth every bite."}
{"text":"I have the plain bagel with cream cheese! Great place thank you so much close to home."}
{"text":"Picked up half a dozen bagels and a black and white cookie on Halloween morning around 8:00. There was one person sitting in the place and another person checking out. I thought this was strange as this should be prime time for getting bagels. We purchased our dough and went home  At home we at our bagels and were delighted.  My parents hadn't  had bagels like this in what felt like years since we left New Jersey.  They were nice and crispy not the outside and still warm and soft on the inside."}
{"text":"Great bagels and really good iced coffee as the ice cubes are actually made of coffee and do not dilute your coffee as they melt. Iced coffee seems to be more of a northeast thing. Maybe that's why I had a hard time finding good iced coffee in NC.  I have had bagels in NYC and these are a pretty close facsimile. Good breakfast sandwiches too."}
{"text":"The bagel sandwiches are almost $8.00! They don't use real eggs. If you want an Everything bagel you have to ask for it before noon, else they've run out. Other than that, they are ok."}
{"text":"I had a craving for a bagel & followed Yelp's good recommendation for BWB.. Was not disappointed. Their Greenpoint, whole wheat w/spinach, mushrooms, egg white & Swiss cheese filled the bill. Ample quantities of each ingredient plus being red hot gave my day a solid start. Having spent 23+ years in the coffee business always challenges me in food service establishments but these folks put that fear to bed. Their dark roast kick started my heart & a refill of their regular blend smoothed out my morning. A real plus for me was enjoying all of this on their wonderful patio, situated under an arch that seems to draw the morning breeze & cumulates at a gorgeous water fountain. Bagel, coffee & comfort for $7, such a deal! P.S. Their staff could not have been nicer."}
{"text":"Best Bagels in town. They are not skimpy giving crème cheese on the bagels. Also, they have great ice coffee and that is refillable. The coffee ice cubes are very cool. The bagels here are huge and better pricing than Bruegger's bagels. If you live by or work close this area please try this place. The staffs I encounter are very friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place! Super friendly staff, AWESOME iced coffee and the bagels are great too! The everything bagel with garden veggie cream cheese is my favorite. Sometimes the place can be busy but they are really fast at getting orders done. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"REAL NEW YORK BAGELS, and in our new neighborhood here in Charlotte! Bagels and owners I can relate to!! This is now our \"go to\" stop for all things bagel (better call in your order if you can't get there first thing - everything is freshly made and sells out quickly!!)."}
{"text":"May be the best bagel place in Charlotte. We've tried others and there is no comparison. The bagels are fresh, made on premises (you can actually view the baking process from the windows while you wait in line) and they're served warm with a crust to the outside. Reminds me of NJ/NY."}
{"text":"I have never dined in, just ordered bagels and they were great! Ordered plain bagels, everything bagels and cream cheese... all delicious! Will try a bagel sandwich next time"}
{"text":"The bagels are the best in town!  The egg sandwiches are different than most as they are freshly made and the exteas are scrambled in the eggs.  Delicious!  The iced coffee with the frozen \"Cubista\" coffee cubes is very good.  I do have one complaint.  They send out occasional coupons which have a very short window of expiration.  Eg. I received one on a Wed and it expired that Sunday!  I didn't realize it had already expired on Monday nor did several other customers.  The one cashier was VERY rude about it.  I really thought they should have honored them.  One customer walked out.  A bad business practice in my opinion."}
{"text":"Super yummy bagel!! Got an egg white, turkey sausage, on Asiago bagel with veggie cream cheese and it was honestly one of the best bagel sandwiches I've ever had! Definitely worth trying this spot! I will be back. Quick service as well!"}
{"text":"I give these places an A for effort but I have tried many a bagel in Charlotte and while these bagels are fine they are not NY bagels. The bagels are decent but when you order egg sandwiches they are HUGE and super messy. I sort of just feel \"meh\" about it."}
{"text":"Fantastic bagels!  We have tried several bagel shops on this side of town when visiting family over the years, but this one tops them all.  We visited 3 times in the 5 days we were in town.  Even though we came at all hours of the morning, they were never out of any type of bagel.  Bagels are crisp on the outside, but light on the inside.  Flavored cream cheeses were also very good.  To top it off, the ice coffee is served with ice cubes made of coffee!  Your drink never get's watered down.  Family has lived in Charlotte for 20 years and after we brought them these, they have decided this is now their go to place."}
{"text":"I've never had a New York bagel, but if this is what they are, I have been missing out in a lot my entire life! I love the everything bagel with plain cream cheese. The bagel has so much flavor and is salty! It's crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The iced coffee is also delicious. They have Ice cubes made from their coffee, so I never waters down! I always go with the flavored iced coffee-- it had Kaluah, hazelnut and all sorts of yumminess in it. The people who work there are super nice and very welcoming. If you have any questions, be sure to ask-- they will answer with a smile!"}
{"text":"Bagel was alright, but um.. I ordered a bacon egg and cheese bagel. Nothing too complicated, right? They forgot the bacon. We didn't realize this until we'd already gotten home, so I was pretty disappointed. I should have listened to the other reviewers that warned about checking your order before you leave. It was rung up correctly, so I trusted that it would be made right. They clearly have some quality control/order accuracy issues going on here."}
{"text":"After using another excellent HY style bagel shop on Providence Road for the past couple years. We moved to Ballantyne a week ago and discovered TOBWBC and what a treat.  Their bagels are even better (to our tastes anyway) than our previous favorite and they are slightly thinner which makes cutting for toasting and use of our toaster even easier.  The other shop's bagels are a lot thicker and hard a hard time fitting onto the toaster, but were very good as well.  Just a personal preference as both are as close to NYC as I think you can get here in Charlotte.  Staff is also great as are their assortment of cream cheeses and chicken salad.  If you are a displaced New Yorker anywhere near Ballantyne you owe it to yourself to give TOBWBC a shot"}
{"text":"I crave these bagels. I come here for two things.  The chestnut coffee and a toasted everything bagel. As a native born NYer I have a need for water bagels. We were born with a bagel in our mouth. These arent as good as a Bagel Train bagel from Suffern NY but they will do.  I must say, whenever I have gone here at about 10/11 am I have obtained a freshly baked just out of the oven everything bagel. Just what I want! Customer service has always been good.  Just try to avoid all the former NYers lurking around at the tables...I have always had my bagel TO GO!!. Oh, the reason I did not give five stars...my hubby asked for walnut raisin cream cheese, a staple in NY/NJ delis.  They do not have these or any other sweet flavors. So sorry Brooklyn but you lost a start."}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  High quality all the way around.  Friendly staff and well organized.  Much better than the other bagel places around.  These taste like authentic NY bagels.  Plus they give you bags to store them and make them last longer.  Sandwiches both breakfast and lunch are high quality as well."}
{"text":"Love BWB!! We go in nearly every weekend and see the same regulars - so that a good sign. The bagels are fresh and tasty and they'll accommodate and prepare just about anyway you can imagine. Our son loves the muffins (stud muffins rock) - the everything bagels hot and toasted are the best!! Coffee is always fresh and the staff is always friendly - that goes a long way when you're talking bagel joints .... Some in the same area are more representative of the \"soupnazi\" from Seinfeld! This place will continue to win our business for sure."}
{"text":"Bagels were good. Eggs not good at all - rubbery and processed tasting. Limited seating options. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"The best bagel in town!  Tried the Greenpoint and the Bushwick....both were awesome but my favorite is the Bushwick (I LOVE the fresh jalapeños on it).  The coffee is always hot and self serve, and they also have self serve iced coffee.  My next trip I am definitely trying the Williamsburg bagel with smoked salmon because it sounds so delish.  Love this place and so glad it's close to our new home...I will be here every weekend probably."}
{"text":"The nicest warmest most accommodating staff I have ever experienced! I love going here everyday because they treat you like family and everyone knows it!!! AND the bagels are very good too!"}
{"text":"Was excited to see this in town as I tried them on my last trip to Florida and loved their bagels. I ordered a pumpernickel with cream cheese... the bagel was disappointing, it was very chewy and a little tough to eat, I had not tried the pumpernickel previously so not sure if that's the style of it or I had a bag bagel, there was also a TON of cream cheese on it... enough cream cheese for at least another bagel, if not maybe two... I would definitely ask for it on the side or super light next time. My friend ordered a whole wheat bagel with egg and cheese.. it was huuuuge, TON of egg on it... (cant complain). We should have shared breakfast for sure! I will go back and give it another try and opt for a different type of bagel, loved this place in FL!"}
{"text":"Bagel review only (haven't tried menu items): Two words- Amazingly great!  Have tried before and thought their everything bagels were above average, but today's batch was as good as any New York/New Jersey bagels I've had. They were crusty on the outside and just right chewy texture on the inside. It's the way I prefer them- possibly these were baked a little too long to get them this way. Hope it was intentional they came out this way.  (Maybe those that grew up with soft, cake texture \"fake\" bagels would think the ones here are not real- but they truly are authentic.)"}
{"text":"I personally love that the bacon was cut up on my bacon egg and cheese bagel.  That made me happy for some reason.  The everything bagel was fresh and the bacon egg and cheese was done well!  The cheese melted into the egg perfectly!  There was a lot of egg so it was a messy breakfast but very tasty!!    I could have 100% done without the \"real new Yorkers\" that were in there trying to pretend this was a bagel joint in the Bronx but I'll get over that.    Overall, quick, friendly service.  Good quality items.  I will be back."}
{"text":"It's not like Brooklyn although I do like their shirts. Coming from living in Bed Stuy I know Brooklyn joints. The bagel was good but I asked for no tomato and they put tomato on it. Prices were kinda on the high side to me. I ordered the Brownsville but probably should have just gotten a bagel with creamed cheese and tasted that. They do make their own bagels you can kind of see how they're made. If I lived in Charlotte I'd go back to give it another chance."}
{"text":"Sunday morning, craving a sausage, egg & cheese. So, instead of the usuals I decided to head toward the Ballantyne area to check out The Original Brooklyn Water Bagel Co. And, boy was I happy. Upon arriving I checked out the menu board and was torn, because a few of the signature meals sounded great. However, I decided to stick with my original craving on an everything bagel. All I can say is fantastic. The egg whites were fresh, not a mold like others I have experienced. The bagel, fresh, chewy, and for an everything bagel it was covered with all the right spices/seasonings! The restaurant has a few two seated and four to six seated tables and a TV. The service was outstanding & they even checked on customers and took finished plates away. I cannot wait to get back."}
{"text":"Hey I think this place is great the bagels are fresh, the salads are fresh, and the Black and White cookies are out of this world. The people are nice and the everything is ready quickly. If you want, need, have to have a great bagel, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"the bagels are great! love the iced cubstas! do not order to-go for large group... had to put lids on all my cups. no to-go creamers. staff was not helpful with take-out!"}
