{"text":"We often stop in for a smoothie and cookie before or after checking out books.  Thank you to Ms. Andrea and Ms. Kim for an informative tour,  card making and tea party for our troop.  The girls really enjoyed the quesadilla, muffins, lemonade and peach tea.  We wish your shop and your community  continued success."}
{"text":"Was looking for a coffee shop and stumbled on this place inside Chandler public library. Small but quaint with a table and 3 recliners. All sales go toward helping survivors of domestic abuse. Definitely would be back if in the area."}
{"text":"This little cafe is located inside the beautiful downtown Chandler public library. I had the strawberry-banana smoothie. The smoothie was bursting with the co-mingled flavors of the two fruits, and it was rich and super creamy as well.  The atmosphere is small, but cozy, trendy and inviting. You can enjoy your meal inside the cafe, or there is a large, nicely laid out dining space, complete with outlets for you to work on your laptop.  The prices are affordable, my smoothie was yummy, and the nice lady behind the counter told me the profits go to help victims of domestic violence. You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite little places to stop and relax, have a bite to eat or just a cold drink.  A few years ago there was a little deli counter here that I loved and I was so disappointed when I found out they had closed.  Then when I came in to get my own library card in April I saw there was a new cafe again!  This is a non-profit business that benefits an organization that provides job training for women and helps them with domestic violence, sexual assault and substance abuse issues including housing, support groups, medical and legal assistance. All the workers are volunteers as I understand it.  There is even a gift shop to help raise money for the cause.  All right there on the library premises where you can stop by before or after you check out your materials.  Not only are the volunteers cheerful and helpful but the food is delicious! My favorite is the chicken salad sandwich, followed close by the tuna salad.  They serve a variety of coffees and smoothies, a few simple breakfast items and desserts, snow cones, Italian sodas (which I usually get) Frappes, etc.  There is usually a Daily Special and you can get a combo with  chips and drink.  Everything I've had here was wonderful.    There is another location of Cup O'Karma up in Mesa on Southern, too."}
{"text":"I believe the espresso shots are pre-pulled and saved in a giant bottle for the day. But because of what they stand for and the program they run, I frequent this shop often. All the workers are survivors of domestic abuse and this helps them get back on their feet and possibly run a business at another location or of similar style. I usually just get plain lattes which can be amazing or so-so depending on the day. Sometimes I want something sweet so I indulge in the mochalicious which is really,really good no matter the day."}
