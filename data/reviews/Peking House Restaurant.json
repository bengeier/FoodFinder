{"text":"This place is simply amazing. The nice lady that runs the place is so welcoming and humble, and the food is to die for. My fiance and I live in Wisconsin, but we've still managed to eat at this place five times in the last couple years. I can't recommend this restaurant enough."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I have ever had. Period."}
{"text":"I'm not from the area, so anytime I'm around this is a must stop.! I get the spicy-bugogli sooo good!! It's very spicy, or you can request for it not to be spicy."}
{"text":"Just passing through the area and saw good reviews at this place, so decided to try it, and was very impressed. The service is prompt, the bulgogi I had hot and fresh. Some of the best Asian food I have had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. I ordered the Kung Pao chicken and it was delicious. All meals come with rice and crab Rangoons. This place's crab Rangoons are to DIE for.  The restaurant itself is pretty low key and quiet. I'd recommend this restaurant to those wanting some good Chinese food in Mahomet."}
{"text":"Came through here on the way to a football game. Food was very good and fresh. Kids enjoyed the crab rangoon that came with their lunch portions. Good menu selection."}
{"text":"Best Asian restaurant in the area. Owner is very nice and works there daily. 

Food is delicious. Definitely the best restaurant in Mahomet and close to the interstate exit. 

Very good."}
{"text":"Beef broccoli and King pao veggies are awesome. Every time we go, we are greeted very nicely and she usually remembers our order!  

So happy to have this restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"The previous review says it all......best Chinese food, period. Visiting family and friends request Peking House every time, and I'm happy to comply! If they delivered, I'd do cartwheels."}
{"text":"It's awesome. Gina is super! She does call in orders ahead of time so my coworkers can walk in and eat immediately."}
{"text":"Got hungry and needed a little something so I figured I would stop here. 

Service: Great. The lady seemed to enjoy talking with me.

Atmosphere: Nice home like atmosphere. Traditional decorations hung on the walls/ceiling.

Food: I ordered some Chicken Fried Rice. Now you walk in and im gonna be honest I wated to walk out cause this place looked pretty run down and a little dirty. In fact the lady had to kill a spider that was right next to my foot! But, this was one of those dont judge a book by its cover things. I got my food and it was hot and fresh, the rice was perfecty moist, the vegetables where crisp and refreshing and it tasted great. This place has been around for years and now I see why. Just with a couple of updates, this place would totally be a five star resturant. Overall, my experience was fantastic and I reccomend this place."}
{"text":"Saw this on google maps after convincing my sister not to get panda express this time and since she wanted a cola from mc donalds in mahomet I told her about this place because of the good reviews. Best chinese I've had, better than \"The Wok\" Just a little ways down the road. You can even buy real chop sticks for $2 there. Not the cheap throw away wooden kind that panda express gives you for free. Sister got beef fried rice and crab rangoon and I got sweet and sour chicken and crab rangoon. Great place to go for lunch or even dinner."}
{"text":"Decided to stop at The Peking House Restaurant for dinner late Friday night after reading a review on Yelp. We shared an order of vegetable egg rolls to start and were not disappointed. The egg roll was the largest I have ever received at a Chinese restaurant and was very crisp, hot and tasty(5*).  My wife decided to go with her usual Chinese staple the Beef Lo Mein entree(4*) and I had the Beef Vegetable entree (5*).  Will definitely return in the future to this friendly family run restaurant."}
{"text":"We live in Mahomet and eat here often. The owners and the food are simply top notch! Every dish is consistantly flavorful and not too salty ! Service is friendly and wonderful! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We've ordered take out from this place 3 times now and its simply great. appies, main dishes, and noodles are all really good.  Top favorites so far are the Chef's Special Happy Family, Moo Shoo Pork, and Chicken Chow Mein (best I've ever had).  I've lived in Los Angeles for the past 15 years and had many great Chinese meals.  This place can certainly hold its own in flavor.  The lady who runs it is always nice and insists you come back again (I love that!).  Note that this is primarily a take out place.  I've seen people eating here before but the restaurant's dinning room is a little rough."}
{"text":"Read all the reviews and went here based on them. Not a good idea. The food was mediocre at best. When you order shrimp and Chinese veggies that is what is expected. No shrimp with broccoli and carrots. Could have done that at home for a third of the price. Will not go back. Also did not get any egg roll or free crab Rangoon"}
{"text":"Amazing Chinese food. Best around. Won't go anywhere but Peking House. The woman that runs the place is very courteous and makes sure you are happy with your food."}
{"text":"Good flavored orange chicken but meat was so tough! Called for carry out, told 30 minutes, and when arrived order was not ready!!!"}
{"text":"It seems as if every town in America has at least one Chinese restaurant. Supposedly this is an artifact from the mass immigration of Chinese workers in the late 1800's venturing eastward across the Pacific to mine silver and lay track for the railroads threading across the western frontier. These restaurants offer an Americanized take on Chinese cuisine. For example, chop suey is a domestic invention adapted to hometown tastes and the availability of vegetables and meats. Each restaurant has its own particular qualities informed by the local inhabitants and proprietor.

So it goes with the Peking House Restaurant. It is a modest storefront in a nondescript strip mall on the east side of Mahomet, sandwiched in between the dry cleaners and a Mexican restaurant. Once inside, you'll find a eatery infused with character, thanks to Gina, the co-owner with her husband. Gina is a sweet person with a huge heart, who'll come sit with you at your table if she has a few moments between orders. 

During one meal, the phone lines went out so the credit card machine was inoperative. Sitting near the counter, I noticed that there was a stream of carry-out orders that were waiting to be picked up. As folks came in to get their food, there was a moment of panic when they found the credit card machine was down. (Doesn't anyone carry cash anymore?) But Gina just told each person how much the order was and that \"they could just pay the next time they came in.\" No receipts. No writing down who ordered what. In many ways, Mahomet is a sort of real-life version of Bailey Park in \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" You couldn't run your business this way in New York or Los Angeles. But in a little Midwestern town, things are different.

The food? Well, it's pretty standard American Chinese fare, so there are no real surprises here. The execution is above average though: sweet sour sauce is freshly made and is not your typical reddish amorphous goo served at many other establishments. Food always comes out blazing hot, fresh from the grill. Chicken chow mein is my personal favorite. The one thing I miss here is they don't serve the thin, pan-fried noodles with the chow mein, instead using crispy won-ton chips. Egg rolls, Mongolian beef, fried rice, all good and at a reasonable price.

I enjoy Golden Harbor in Champaign, but lately I've been coming here a lot more often. Maybe it's just to hang out with Gina. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Always delish! Best kept secret. We drive from champaign, passing several other options on the way because Peking house has never disappointed."}
