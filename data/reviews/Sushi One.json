{"text":"Definitely not the worst sushi I've ever had. However it wasn't good at all. I would stay away from the tuna it tasted off and very mushy. The only thing good about this restaurant is the service. Lastly, it's very easy to order too much. Keep track of the quantity as they charge for every uneaten piece."}
{"text":"The all you can eat buffet is extremely good value for money. Considering most sushi can be pretty pricey these days it gives you the ability to try virtually everything on the menu. It incorporates deserts as well as beverages and all this for $22! Faultless. One down side is though that compared to most sushi hangouts in Toronto the quality isn't at the highest standard. Also there obsession with frying a variety of other items outside of tempura also confused me some what. The option of Chicken poppers made me chuckle slightly. But the sheer value for money the all you can eat stopped me revoking a star due to these factors. One must, get the mackerel samushi. Stunning."}
{"text":"Great service and good sushi for a reasonable price"}
{"text":"Sushi one's sushi is ok. I wasn't a huge fan of their spicy salmon roll but their spider roll (and soft shelled crab appetizer) were amazing. Their lunch bento boxes are quite large considering their reasonable price. I'm especially fond of their chicken teriyaki."}
{"text":"This was the first all-you-can-eat Japanese place recommended by local friends when I moved into the area.  However, I find it quite overrated.  The food is mostly decent, but the space is a bit cramped, the food is just average for restaurants of this ilk.  Their idea of \"all you can eat\" is to limit the number of sashimi pieces your *entire party* can order each time to just eight pieces -- and I don't mean eight pieces of each type, but eight *total* pieces of every type of sashimi.  I understand all-you-can-eat places that charge you for food you don't finish, but this place's policy is just cheap and automatically makes the customer feel like s/he is not trusted.  Most importantly, this place is two to three dollars more expensive for dinner than every other all-you-can-eat place I've ever gone to, while the food isn't any better.  One thing I do like is that their all-you-can-eat dinner opens quite early; we were able to get that dinner even before 5PM.  Other than that, however, I find no reason to go to this place; My Sushi, up a few blocks north on Yonge, has superior food that costs less.  I won't be going to Sushi One for its all-you-can-eat meals again."}
{"text":"Review on sushi takeaway food. Good quality sushi. It can get a bit busy on the weekend and then the service is a little slower but overall a great place.  Staff are helpful and the inside is clean."}
{"text":"best of it's kind. There is a reason Sushi one is always packed and its not that the food is out of this world or anything (in other words don't expect Kaji). It's always packed because it is solid and consistent. the sushi is good,  the prices are CHEAP and because the service is polite and fast. I don't think it competes with other places in the city and no one is calling it authentically Japanese, but if you want sushi in North York this place hits the spot. Far surpasses other places in the area for quality of sushi. Korean sushi places are a dime a dozen all over, IMO this is the best of them and judging by the business they do, others agree.   * should mention that sushi is definitely your best bet here. fresh delicious and brought to you immediately.  The cooked food is pretty good too but have ordered a couple cooked things that were kind of bland. for cooked food, sushi motto is better but also twice the price"}
{"text":"Went here around 830 on New Years Eve with my girlfriend. We were seated immediately and the service was great. The rolls were a little on the expensive side but they were extremely good. We ordered the giant dynamite and passion shrimp rolls. In and out in under 45 minutes on New Years Eve without a reservation is pretty outstanding. I will definitely return to this restaurant compared to the extremely bland and disappointing sushi moto across the street."}
{"text":"just finished a fabulous all you can eat session. We came in a little later and the staff did their best to accommodate us.   The food was very well made, they gave us exactly what we ordered and never tried to short change us. They didn't needlessly add too much rice to their rolls or sushis.  The price was very reasonable all you can eat was 25 bucks"}
{"text":"Love the lunch special! Service is pretty good, and fast too.   However, don't get their ramen, its a ripe off. That thing looks like instant noodle, tastes like instant noodle, but the price of $7 or so definitely does not fit the instant noodle bill.."}
{"text":"I was craving for ayce and i almost threw up cause i ate too much. I went there at 9:40 pm on Friday and they told me the last order is 10:15. I quickly ordered my first round and order the second Round once the food started coming.  My tip Is not to go too late.  Or else u will eat in a rush.  The dinner was $2 extra than the weekday price which is $21.99 +$2+tax.  Food was great but they don't hv vanilla ice cream :/ does it worth $27? I'm not sure because i know better places with a cheaper piece."}
{"text":"The sushi is great over here, especially the maki rolls. My favorite one is spicy tuna special roll.  I think the price is well worth it as the rolls are quite big! A must try!!"}
{"text":"Good sushi but prices have gone up significantly. Service isn't that great if you go alone. They forget that youre there."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Just average, a bit on the pricey side for the freshness of the fish. Came for lunch on a Friday, was quite busy but there's better options in the immediate area"}
{"text":"I'm officialy a fan of sushi one. This place is conveniently located right across my workplace, so I go here often. Their lunch special is very reasonably priced for a sushi joint, I'd rather go here to have the lunch special rather then having to buy fast food at sheppard center. Regarding the AYCE, I think this is one of the best that I've ever been in terms of quality and preparation (Tip: Go before or after lunch hour if you're going for AYCE since it tend to get overly crowded during lunch hour, and the food will take forever to come during that time span, making AYCE a bad option)  Overall, I'd definitely come back here whenever I'm having sushi craving."}
{"text":"Average, but decent place for all-you-can-eat or a la carte. Good prices for lunch specials too. Patio is a plus to enjoy the warmer weather."}
{"text":"The sushi is made beautifully and the portions are great. The customer service is even better. They're very welcoming and sweet. Id say one of my favourite sushi places."}
{"text":"Sushi is 8/10 with your standard fare of menu offerings. They have a good selection of bentos with good variety.   However, the customer service was subpar. They got our order wrong, we had to wait 20 mins for the redo. Once our correct order came, they forgot to exchange the sashimi as my friend was allergic. Not only did they not apologize, they charged us extra."}
{"text":"The AYCE here is very good, amazing service and if you love japanese/korean cuisine you won't be disappointed. Well deserved 5 stars."}
{"text":"This rating is for their EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.  If there is an option for ZERO stars, that is what this place will get.  We have dined here a couple times before, customer service was not the best, but it had been tolerable.  However, what happened yesterday completely pissed me off.  Since I was in a hurry and was running late for lunch, I googled up their phone number and menu online.  I called them to place my order before travelling to pick it up.  The place was on the way for me and I've been wanting to have some Japanese food the past few weeks so I decided to order from them.  When I went in to pick up my food, the order was ready. However, what shocked me was the price! The waitress said my bill was $20.32.  I was expecting it to be under $20.   I told the lady at the counter that I specifically placed an order for their Lunch Specials, and if she could double check that it was what I ordered.  She said yes, it was and I told her that the price on their website says $6.50 and she is charging me $8.99 (more than 30% more than I was expecting to pay)!  She then mentioned that they had increased their prices recently but that they have not updated the website yet.  I said, yes, understand that you did but you did not update that on your website and I ordered the items based on the information posted there.  The only response she gave was, \"I will inform my manager that the website it not updated.  We have changed our prices 2 months ago.\"  (Ok, so you had 2 months and you did not care to update your website??!)    I don't care when you changed your prices.  In this day and age, when you have an online  presence, it is your due diligence to reflect that accurately so that your customers are not misinformed.  A reputable establishment would have HONORED the website price because it is CLEARLY THEIR FAULT that it was not updated.  But that DID NOT HAPPEN.  If I were not running really late and have not eaten anything in the last 5 hours, I would have refused to pick it up.  (On hindsight, I feel like I should've done that - just to make a point).     I DON'T MIND paying $20 for lunch for 2 people once in awhile and IF I KNEW BEFOREHAND THAT I WAS PAYING THAT AMOUNT.  I absolutely HATE it when I am misinformed and you won't own up to your mistake."}
{"text":"I visited Sushi One on Saturday, September 24th at 10:10pm. I've never been to a restaurant so average. Generally, sushi restaurants have very good service and very good food but I've had better sushi service from grocery stores.  I was quickly seated and given menus. The waitress asked what I wanted to drink and I said tea. As she arrived with my tea I was ready to order. I originally wanted to order a sashimi dinner and a tempura dinner but she recommended that I order the sashimi dinner and a shrimp tempura appetizer instead. I went with that.  The tea was fresh and warm.  She quickly brought over my miso soup and a salad. The salad did not look appetizing at all but I tried it and I liked it so there's that. The miso was ok as well apart from the fact that it wasn't hot.  She next, before my appetizer, brought over my sashimi dinner and rice.   The rice seemed to have been sitting out for a while as it was luke warm and wasn't clumping like it should. Typically, rice from sushi restaurants is soft and fluffy and doesn't feel granular in your mouth but that wasn't the case. It was difficult to eat because of its texture.   Most of the sashimi was relatively fresh but not as fresh as other restaurants I've been too and was very chewy. It was thick but there wasn't a lot of variety on the plate. Most places that I've visited had these in their sashimi dinners: salmon, tuna, crab, hamachi, white tuna, octopus, clam, and more... I only got salmon, tuna, white tuna, and hamachi. Nothing positively stood out about it but the maguro sashimi was really bad. I had to fight the urge to shudder whilst eating it. It didn't taste fresh at all but musty. However, I am not fearful for my health.  She brought my appetizer about 10 minutes after my sashimi dinner. The tempura batter was really good; it was crisply and not very oily. The tempura sauce was alright but I decided not to use it as it didn't seem to go well with the tempura   One issue that not many people consider is hydration. Throughout all of this, my waitress was too busy talking to a coworker to find out that I had run out of tea. I stopped eating shortly after receiving my tempura to catch her attention and hopefully have her asking if I was ok. She never came. I attempted to call her over several times but she wasn't paying attention.  When I finished I pushed all of my plates to the other side of the table. I hoped that she would notice this and come over. It took her 15 mins and a bathroom break to notice that I was sitting around idle but, upon noticing, she quickly ran over with the bill.  It cost about $20 before the tip that I gave her anyway even though the service wasn't great.  It took so long for me to write this review because I forgot about this place because nothing really stands out.  I'll gladly go back again if anything changes. Maybe with my few pointers we can make Sushi One a more unique place to eat."}
{"text":"Oh sushi one! Great prices (especially their lunch specials), good sushi, hilariously bad service. I always get the same lunch special, but half the time the bring it after all my friends are already finished their food or they bring me the wrong one (and one that contains fish, which I don't eat). Staff is disinterested and standoffish. But this is one place that I don't mind the bad service. It's actually quite entertaining and part of the overall experience. My friends and I like to see whether they'll bring me the right order or whether I'll get my food at all. My one friend and I would randomly yell out \"Sushi One!\" in amused amazement throughout our meal whenever there was a typical bad service moment, with a loud one at the end in surprise when they actually brought us our bills in a timely manner.  The lunch specials are great - $7.50 for 2 sets of maki rolls, a salad and a miso soup or for teriyaki. The tofu teriyaki is tempura silken tofu as opposed to fried tofu (I prefer fried tofu in my teriyaki personally).  The decor is nice and in the summer they have a lovely patio with a fountain. They do get busy busy around lunch time so come early or late to avoid the rush or get takeout and eat in the nearby park (assuming it's summer time and you can order ahead from your office).  It's one of the few places in that area to eat where there are vegan options for good prices. Don't let the service dissuade you - if you're hungry and in north york, I recommend checking it out if not just to play the \"SUSHI ONE!\" game."}
{"text":"Sushi one is a great lunch spot. The lunch specials are good in terms of quality, quantity and value. It gets really busy so if you want a table then I recommended going before 12pm. I haven't been here for dinner but I did notice they have ayce. Seemed a little pricey compared to others. But I haven't been so maybe they have a better food selection."}
{"text":"Extremely good quality food for not just sushi but also meats and other dishes  (their kalbi and shrimp tempura is to die for!!) I don't normally like AYCE but this place is worth it for how good and fresh all their dishes are. The place loses 2 stars because of the limit for sashimi to order (only 10 pieces per person per order sheet) - which I find extremely stupid because why charge $30 (which is pretty hefty for AYCE) and have that type of limitation."}
{"text":"The sushi is great, some of the best sushi in the area. The service is fast and profesional.   As word of its quality has spread, it has become much busier. Unfortunately the prices have correspondingly gone up as well. The prices for all you can eat are as much as a fine dining restaurant. Resultantly, be prepared to fork out a lot of dough if you go here for dinner or even lunch all you can eat.  Overall, still recommended."}
{"text":"I have been getting take out sushi here for years and considered it to be pretty good sushi and thought, why not go for Father's Day and see what it is like to dine in.   The first upsetting incident, some of the people at the table wanted ayce and others with myself included wanted to order just a meal, well this was apparently not possible. I tried to say that due to dietary restrictions, I was unable to eat huge amounts of rice and wanted just one of their sashimi dinners but It is an all or none sort of place, so if one person wants ayce then everyone has to have it. So here I was forced to have all you can eat where the selection is limited to the cheaper fish or many of the unhealthiest rolls with lots of deep fried options.   The next odd thing was their ayce list, which  are literally 1 small piece rather then some personal serving size. So if I order 1 under salmon sashimi, rather then bringing some sort of one serving order, they bring me a small single slice of salmon which resembled a half cut of a piece of clementine or the funniest is the calamari, if you put 1 here, they will bring you out a single battered ring.   Then for our group of people, they took about 30 minutes to bring out each sheet we filed in. This meant we were waiting almost 45 minutes before we even saw any food what so ever.  We finally asked what is taking so long and they complained that there are other people in the restaurant they have to serve to. Why offer ayce if it is something you clearly can't handle. The best part to the time delayed service, you have a 2 hour time limit.   By about the 2 hour time, we were to frustrated to want to order anymore and quite honestly I think they gave up on even wanting to serve us as some from our table had to keep asking where is the food we ordered. We didn't even get the last order of stuff and basically said just wanted to leave, I feel everyone secretly want to go home just to have something resembling a decent meal still.   The only reason I give this place 2 stars, the food actually tasted pretty good but I think if I want to get sushi in this area again, I would definitely go across the street and have a regular meal at Moto sushi."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Great for take out food. The place is really small, but cozy and warm for a lunch date. Order the volcano roll - its really uniquely prepared at this place."}
{"text":"I have been here on a regular basis for AYCE, i can say this was one of my favourite places to go to on a friday or saturday, i never had to wait for a table as the waitresses all knew me and I know them by name. but i'm sorry to say this will be my last time.  The reason is not for the food, or the service as i think the food quality is great for an AYCE. The reason is that the the owners older daughter (who was in charge that night) decides she would charge an extra $5 to our AYCE bill because I refused to eat 6 pieces ( 1 roll) that was sitting on a plate when paying my bill.  that was not cool, so they decided that their $5 was more important than a regular customer that came 3 - 5 times a month with a party of 6 (minimum).  my tip to fellow yelpers clear the plates of food before asking for the bill."}
{"text":"The restaurant had great lunch specials, I was craving sushi so I went in without knowing the quality. I came here with friends that aren't experienced with Japanese food but wanted to try.  What to Expect -Lunch time wasn't too busy yet the service was a little slow. -The restaurant has a contemporary atmosphere, nothing special. -Most items on their lunch special menu is under $8.  What I Ate -Had S08 ($6.50) Spicy Crispy Roll and Spicy Avocado Roll. Rice was great, not too mushy yet flavourful. Spicy sauce wasn't spicy at all.  -Tea wasn't given to us, a little odd for me. -Miso soup was hot and the way it should be, salad was drenched in the orange dressing.   It's OK if you want cheap sushi, I'd rather pay $12 for AYCE sushi somewhere else which would be the same quality as their lunch special."}
{"text":"I love sushi, i love this place.  i always order the same thing, every other day, one red dragon roll. its $13 but you get what you pay for, the rolls are HUUUUUGE. it fills you up for hooours, its always fresh, always up to my expectations and the staff is very welcoming and sweet.   :)"}
{"text":"If you are an experienced sushi eater you might find this restaurant mediocre, but I like it because the sushi rolls are delicious and fresh for the price."}
{"text":"1. Nice environment but was too cold sometimes. 2. I always get Bento Box Deluxe, which was with low price but lots of food of all kinds (vegie, rice, sushi, soup, meat, fruit, etc.) 3. Tried something else the other day, tasted good too.  4. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"After reading some of the negative reviews, I was hesitant to visit Sushi One, but I'm so glad I did. The visit left a very positive impression on me!  We went on a Friday around lunch hour and the place wasn't quite full.  The All-You-Can-Eat was $17 per person, which was more than I anticipated, and I joked with my spouse, \"$17? It better be good...\" Let me tell you, the quality more than made up for it. First of all, the service was very prompt. We were halfway through our miso soup when the first *plate* of sushi came by, and we were stunned at the speed. Dishes streamed out quickly after that. The edamame was firm but well steamed and the tempura was really hot and orderable in single pieces. Throughout the meal, our finished dishes were quickly cleared, tea refilled, and at one point a waiter noticed we had a lull in our eating - no more than 5 minutes - and asked if we were missing anything. He got that udon out of the kitchen right away.  The sushi also came incredibly quickly.  There were 4 sushi chefs at the counter instead of the usual 2 or 3 I've always seen at similarly sized AYCE places, and the sushi was the right size: able to be consumed in one mouthful. The wasabi was extremely powerful and so delightful; at most places it's weak, and at worst mushy, but this wasabi had body and tingled my nostrils. What impressed me most was the fact that their nori (seaweed) was TOASTED for my handrolls. It was crispy, and had a faint warmth that gave my handrolls a satisfying crunch.  Most of the time when I order handrolls they quickly become a little soggy from the steam coming off the rice, so Sushi One gets full marks for little details like the toasted nori, it was just such a nice touch! The maki was pleasant too, as even a \"basic\" tuna roll was still complemented with avocado and crab meat in good proportions.   The only downside was that there wasn't any unagi (eel) sushi on the AYCE menu. Perhaps there is on the à la carte one. Still, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal there and am thrilled to live nearby. I anticipate a monthly visit from now until I move away, as sushi is my favourite but I haven't the luxury to drive anywhere in this cold weather. This is definitely the place in Willowdale to get your AYCE sushi fix - after an intense workout, on a lazy Saturday, or with friends who share similar enthusiasm for good fish and a hearty meal."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Sushi One this evening. The restaurant was cozy with a casual feel.  The restaurant is not very large, but the tables are well spaced out with an adequate layout that allows for easy conversation without having to listen to the tables next to you. Had the soft shell crab for appetizer which was well done.  It was hot and crispy with good flavour.  The accompanying ponzu sauce was a little tart given that there was a lemon wedge in it.  I would have preferred the lemon wedge on the side, but overall it was a fine appetizer. For dinner, I had the Deluxe Sushi combo (9 pieces of assorted sushi, a dynamite roll, and a hand roll) while my wife had the Gold Sashimi combo (15 pieces of assorted sashimi).  Both combos came with a salad and miso soup to start which were tasty.  When it came to the main courses, overall, the dishes were adequate.  Presentation of the dishes was quite nice.  The assortment and flavour of fish was reasonably good, but not great.  The size of the sushi and sashimi was also on the small side. Service was efficient although not very friendly. Prices are fair for what you get. Would I go back?  Hmmm.....tough question.  I had no problems with my dining experience and would easily go back given that the restaurant offers a casual place to get sushi within walking distance of where I live, however, there are numerous other sushi restaurants within the same neighbourhood (Sushi Moto, Ichiban, Nome, Sushi Bong, etc) which can make it difficult to decide where to go for sushi and which also offer compelling reasons to pick them as my default neighbourhood sushi establishment."}
{"text":"Had the beef teriyaki bento box lunch special for take out. It wasn't special. The service was fast though."}
{"text":"When we are in the neighbourhood visiting Cindy's Mom, @ Yee Hong up the street on Mavis, we head here to Sushi One. We like the little appetizers they serve. Very tasty. We usually order the Bento boxes. For the price, it's good value. The Japanese family that runs it is friendly and service is always pretty quick.  Overall, it's better value here than the sushi place up the street!"}
{"text":"Food is really good quality for the price.  They are very genorous with the portion.. which a lot of restaurant this days, are cheap. I recommend to come to this restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Korean owned sushi place on Yonge St near Sheppard.   We had tried the all you can eat menu for lunch one day but you know the AYCE menu wasn't presented up front nor did I see any mention of it anywhere? It's top secret it seems... if I didn't hear about it from Yelp reviews I wouldn't have known to ask about it.  Some notable dishes I had:  Chicken cutlet with curry Potato Croquette Agedashi tofu  I'd be back.. :)"}
{"text":"Our favourite sushi restaurant, always very fresh fish, extremely fast and courteous service, all you can eat is a little pricey close to 30 $ per person for dinner but you will be served the highest quality of sushi and sashimi and yet the quality doesnt go down as you order several times, you would have to park and pay on Yonge street for 3 $ an hour"}
{"text":"Really fresh!  Got the salmon lover lunch special and found it to be delicious.  Would definitely return.  Prompt takeout service too."}
{"text":"Normally these guys are great but after waiting 45 mins for a take out order and asking them why someone who ordered 15mis after me to reply \"oh, sorry\"....is totally unacceptable. They must have new management as lately, service has been terrible and I go there weekly!"}
{"text":"We started coming to Sushi One when we moved into the Willowdale neighbourhood. My experience has always been great there. The staff are friendly, you sometimes get a free appetizer on the house, the sushi is fresh, and the presentation is lovely! We've gone here many times and will continue to do so in the future."}
{"text":"Been here for AYCE dinner twice.   Service is slow as expected. They tend to push out the hot foods before giving the sushi/sashimi. The sashimi isn't the best, but the hot foods are pretty good, especially the kalbi. For the price (I think it's $22 or around there), there are better AYCE choices in the city."}
{"text":"The service was decent enough, never had a bad experience here after more or less five visits. The sushi tastes great for the price! They have a whole bunch of fusion sushi selection. I tried volcano roll and sweet shrimp roll and was amazed at how good it was. Will definitely continue to come back! Oh and they serve Kalbi (korean barbeque ribs) for their AYCE menu. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Not worth it and never coming back.  I came here once but Sushi One used cheap imitation crab rolls instead of those made-in-Japan crab rolls and never went back. Their All-You-Can-Eat seemed like a good deal and had good reviews online so I went today for lunch with a baby in a stroller.  There were 3 servers standing near the door but no one came to help me while I tried to maneuvered through the doors and finally a patron who sat far away came to my aid. Maybe that was a sign of the service already. I had arrived early and there were only a few tables seated so I thought I'd be able to get a good seat with the baby and stroller. They only allowed me to sit at the small table right by the door, which was windy whenever the front doors opened. They refused to let me sit at a 4-person table claiming it was for 4 people but throughout my entire stay, these tables near me all had only 2 people seated.   From the All-You-Can-Eat menu, I ordered rolls, sushi and the sushi pizza. To let you know, the All-You-Can-Eat menu has no sashimi and no BBQ eel (unagi) on it. The dragon roll that came looked nothing like the a la carte version or those you see in the pictures. Every piece of sushi pizza fell apart once I picked it up. It all became lumps, which was difficult to eat.   There are 4 other sushi restaurants across the street from Sushi One. There's no doubt I'm never coming back. I don't understand where the good reviews came from. I'd rather eat quality food with that money. If you have children or am in a wheelchair, you can forgo this place."}
{"text":"We went as a family for Father's Day today. I was so disappointed in the service. We ordered the all you can eat menu and when our food came the order did not have our amounts we ordered or all the food we asked for. The second sheet of ordering took 35 minutes to come and with complaining a bit of food started to come . Part of our group had to leave as we had to drive a long way home. We were there at 5:30 ordered food by six and we're still waiting for food at 7:30... We had two children with us as well. Not happy and we will not return! Expensive and poor service went home hungry still... We were a party of ten people they got their money from us !!! It was too bad because the food was pretty good.., could not even get water refills without asking three times ..."}
{"text":"Had a serious craving for all you can eat sushi so we decided to check out sushi one. Upon arrival, we saw a sign that said no ayce on the weekends due to short staff. :( We decided to stay anyway and ended up getting a bento box each.   For 16.99 we got bento box C that included miso soup and salad, 5 pieces salmon sashimi, 3 assorted sushi, japchae, rice, chicken katsu, and 4 piece dynamite roll. The dynamite roll featured what tasted like caesar dressing on top. Caesar sushi? Not a fan!!!! Salad was overdressed, the katsu was also too saucy. I guess everything was too saucy.   The sashimi was yummy, and the sushi was alright. For the price the box was worth it, I was too full to finish the japchae and rice. But if I go back next time I'd ask for no sauce."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a month with my co-workers since I work at Yonge and Sheppard.   The highlight is the price - $6.99 lunch specials with 2 rolls (they give you quite a few combinations), salad, and soup.  Their rolls and sushi do not have a lot of rice, I really like that. Service is decent, i've never had any problems and they haven't done anything extraordinary. They don't mind if we want separate bills, which is nice.  Their decor is decent, although some tables can be a bit small, but they would move them around to accommodate you.  There's a patio area which is nice in the summer.  This is my go to place for lunch."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick sit-down sushi place with incredible value, this is the spot for you. I come here with my girlfriend about once every couple of months when I'm craving a cheap bento box.   I usually come for their lunch-time prices. The best value, I find, is their combo-bento boxes where you can have any combination of tempura, teriyaki, sushi, or sashimi.   For the most part, you get what you pay for. The food isn't anything too exceptional, but it hits the spot when you're feeling hungry. They serve complimentary appetizers and green tea ice cream with your meal. I've never had a problem with their service but I only come during low peak time hours.  Overall, I would recommend sushi one to anyone that's looking for cheap sushi to fill their pallet."}
{"text":"Sushi one is my favourite sushi place to go in this area. Waiters are usually quick and friendly and everything I tried there was delicious. I can't recall one single thing that I didn't like. They're not too pricy and portions are usually pretty big."}
{"text":"I visited with my friend for AYCE sushi. It was a Friday evening so they charged us extra, for $30 per person. I'd say that we got our money's worth. We had a whole assortment of sushi and sashimi, as well as a set of tempura. They did not skimp on the quality of food, and I thoroughly enjoyed all types of food the restaurant offered. I especially liked the tako-yaki and kalbi. The teriyaki and dessert could have been better though. The servers were very friendly and prompt. I would definitely come back, but perhaps when it is not as expensive."}
{"text":"Went back a month later and the service was again not great.  Food was not satisfactory.  The salmon sashimi had a weird texture and the tempura batter was a little cakey!  It's nice that the place is very close to the Toronto Centre for the Arts."}
{"text":"The rolls here weren't rolled tight. At most average for ayce sushi.  I enjoyed the Kimchi more than anything else."}
{"text":"Best Japanese place in Toronto that I have been to.  Their all you can eat is top and they don't skimp on anything.  I usually get bento box c for dinner for delivery.  But I have eaten in loads of times and I have never been disappointed. I wish I knew the recipe for the sauce that they put on their giant dynamite roll. It's amazing.  I used to live in north York and would get my Japanese fix from this place regularly.   Would recommend to anyone who likes Japanese !"}
{"text":"I love this place. Its affordable, tasty and fresh. They have varieties of options. What i like is that they half some option of full/half portion"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch yesterday with a co-worker and it was very busy! Sushi One now has an AYCE lunch menu which I find has made this place busier. The food is decent for sushi and yesterday I had the S9 which features 6 cucumber and 6 spicy tuna pieces. The lunch specials also come with a big bowl of salad and miso soup. My co-worker had another lunch special which came with pieces of tempura (sweet yam). The lunch specials are very decently priced here ($6.99 on average) and you will be full. I didn't need to eat dinner afterwards. I paid for my co-worker as well so lunch in total came out to be $21 including tips which was not bad at all.  A couple of tips:  1. For those who work in the vicinity and want to take-out, you can always call ahead and pre-order. A great alternative if you want warm sushi lunch 2. Sushi-One also delivers dinner (not sure for lunch, but perhaps if the order is big enough) in the near area. Living near Bayview and Shep, I have had delivery many times in the winter 3. Service is pretty quick here so for people who work, it is manageable to be able to sit down and have lunch within the hour  Service is standard. Never had an unpleasant experience here. Our waitress yesterday asked if we wanted separate bills before hand which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"This place is near a federal government building... so you know it must have to have cheap lunch specials to stay in business. For $7.50 my typical order was the lunch special: a miso soup, a salad (chopped iceburg lettuce with tangy dressing), and I usually got either the spicy tuna roll or shrimp tempura roll and either avocado or cucumber roll. Nice and filling!  Lunch was good, filling, and inexpensive. The only downside is that there isn't much substance in the sides.  The miso is basically cloudy broth with a few cubes of tofu and the salad is little more than iceburg lettuce and shredded carrot.  The upside is that the sushi is consistently decent. Another bonus is a very sunny patio in the summer!"}
{"text":"Overall, this restaurant use less sodium compare to others. After eating, you may less feel sleepy."}
{"text":"3.5-4 stars  Their lunch and dinner combos are well priced for what you get. I quite like the Beef Teriyaki bentou. They don't have the best quality of sushi but the large selection of sushi rolls is perfect to satisfy a sushi craving for sure.  Service is always good. The waitresses are attentive and quick to fill my tea.   I go to Sushi One when I want to nom on sushi and also happen to be in the area. It does the job to fulfill my craving."}
{"text":"the outer appearance of this restaurant is not very appealing, but the inside is more more decorated. Prices for a roll range around ten dollars for one. Food took a while to arrive but it is very good and the salmon is quite fresh. Washroom looks very clean."}
{"text":"Sushi One located on Yonge and Sheppard has always been packed when I go get take out for lunch.  It was literally a zoo in there I had to go around 20 people to get to the counter to pick up my food and I had no where to stand cause I keep blocking the servers.  I wouldn't feel comfortable eating while 20 people is standing all around me. (You know this place is good if it is always packed like this). And the fact that parking in the area is terrible doesn't make the wait any better.  They have very good lunch specials for amazing price that comes with salad and soup for around $6.99.  Quality is good and they have AYCE for those hungry folks.  The place is very small so don't go during lunch hours to avoid and long waits. They also have a nice patio for sunny days.    Overall, Sushi One is a wonderful Japanese place in the heart of the busy city; but I guess I will stick to my take out for now as I am not fond of crowded places. I would like to dine in and maybe try the AYCE but I sure won't be coming anytime soon especially in peak hours.  Rating: (I only   Service: 3/5 Food Quality: 3/5 Comfort 2/5 Decor  3/5 Value: 3/5 Parking: 1/5"}
{"text":"Unfortunately with the raised prices all across the menu this place is no longer a good choice, considering that there are many higher quality Japanese establishments within a 5 minute walk. It used to be the best place for 'decently' priced cuisine, however now it is in the same ballpark with the competition which blow it out of the water in terms of both quality and selection.   Although the service has always been just 'OK' it was tolerable for the good prices, now that the prices are hiked its just a middle of the road restaurant which cannot compete with the big 3 Japanese restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Big disappointment!! Always eat AYCE Japanese restaurant in Mississauga area; tried to find a real and better quality Japanese restaurant. After checking the reviews, decided to try this place. We ordered the medium sashimi tray and the udon soup. There are only 4 different kinds of sashimi, they were cut into different sizes; some thick, some small, very unprofessional chef. The udon soup has no taste at all. I don't know why other people left good reviews for this fake Japanese food restaurant. Will not go back for sure, it is worse than AYCE."}
{"text":"Great sushi, extremely fresh. My favorite place to go in Toronto right now, and I've probably half the sushi restaurants in the GTA. Their prices are great too, especially the lunch specials. I've been here more than 5 times and their food has always been consistently good."}
{"text":"PROS 1. Good tasting, nicely presented food. Way above average for a restaurant with All You Can Eat (AYCE) 2. Good dining environment, nicely renovated 3. Exceptional service, always very attentive, polite and patient. 4. Reasonably priced (on the cheap side for non-AYCE)  CONS 1. For AYCE, the fried dishes tend to always come first to fill us up, a common tactic used by AYCE restaurants  OVERALL Highly recommended! If fried food comes first, just eat it slow until the sushi/sashimi comes : )"}
{"text":"We ate here on Monday for AYCE. We really enjoyed their sushi! What I really liked was the variety of their vegetarian sushi options. I pretty much tried every roll and everything was amazing. I have no complains about the food quality. And for the service, considering the fact that we went at 4:45ish and there weren't a lot of people in the restaurant, our food arrived quickly, and the servers provided good service. The only thing that holds me from coming back is the price. We paid $30 each for the AYCE. Which is insanely pricey compared to other AYCE. No regrets!"}
{"text":"This is for the sushi lovers, Arguable the best sushi in town, great service, excellent food, doesn't really get any better, come here at least once a month and if you haven't tried it you're missing out a great experience."}
{"text":"My friends and I were getting hungry, and craved sushi. We didn't know of any sushi places nearby, so but stumbled upon this place. We cam an hour before last call so we gobbled down our food quick. The food itself was pretty good, but nothing really stood out. I'm a big fan of spicy salmon sashimi, however this location added way too much of the spicy sauce. Other than that it was good and filled me up - all for $30ish after tax+ tip."}
{"text":"Love their all you can eat menu! In such a great location! A lot of variety l, the sushi is always fresh!"}
{"text":"this place is down the street from my building and whenever i have some extra money/time i always order from sushi one. my favourite thing to order is the special maki set which comes with 12 pieces of spicy tuna and salmon maki, 8 pieces of a dragon roll? (its shrimp tempura with avocado and cucumber), and soup and salad all for $13.50. ive never dined in but take out is super great."}
{"text":"Simply amaZing and awesome customer service. I eat here a lot to be honest  yelp wants me to keep writing but honestly it's just good food and well priced."}
{"text":"Not a lot of options for the lunch AYCE menu. Pretty decent service and their washrooms are pretty nice. They only have ice cream as a desert option. I prefer Sushi Legend; they have a lot more options for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"My friend was dying to bring me here for a while. Finally went today and I was definitely impressed. The waiters were speedy and friendly the moment we stepped in. Although sitting closer to the window would have probably made the restaurant appear \"fuller,\" they brought us to a \"warmer\" table inside. After coming here today, making the restaurant not look empty didn't seem to be a concern as it was busy and looked like a local favourite.  I was overwhelmed with the large selection of food ranging including sushi, tempura, udon, katsu, sashimi, bento boxes, etc. The waiters were very kind when they came to our table to check up every couple minutes to see if I've made a decision, as it did take me a while. My friend ordered the silver sashimi combo which came with about 10 pieces of sashimi, rice, salad, and soup ($16?) while I ended up ordering the deluxe bento (chicken teriyaki, rice, salad, miso soup, 6 pieces of maki, vegetable tempura ($10). The food came pretty fast.  Everything tasted fresh and not too oily.   Overall: + Tempura was crispy + Friendly and quick service + Wonderful atmosphere although a bit tight (take in mind the location)  Cons - Something aside from oranges (in the bento box) for dessert? Perhaps ice cream or another special Asian dessert?  I will definitely be coming back to try their super rolls! Especially with my friend, who happens to come here every two weeks or so."}
{"text":"nothing out of the ordinary, okay sushi. Lunch (weekday) specials are more worth it then the weekend specials which are way too overpriced."}
{"text":"Quality restaurant, delicious food.. kinda pricy (now).  Pros: The seaweed on the hand rolls are the Crispiest seaweed I have ever had anywhere. It's so crunchy. It's delicious! The spicy salmon hand roll is irresistible. Might make me come back, despite the cons I listed below.  Cons: 1)All you can eat price recently went up from $22.99 to 24.99 on weekdays (+$1 on weekends)  2)The menu has been updated -- it got smaller  3) The limitations for maximum pieces per sheet got more strict. -- Used to be 20pcs of sashimi per person, per sheet.. now it's 10. And now its 6pcs of sushi per person, per sheet.. that never used to exist."}
{"text":"We had \"All you can eat\"  Tempura was great, special rolls were generally good, some of them were disappointing, especially tamago sashimi and sushi pizza (salmon). Worst part was service. There were looooong gaps between dishes, some items didn't come but marked as served; we had to remind our order at least two times. This place was packed, it's not only their popularity but also their slow service."}
{"text":"Was craving sushi, and this place hit the sweet spot perfectly.  I recommend the Double Dragon Roll. Food is reasonably priced I sat on the cool patio bc the day is beautiful.  Looks cool inside too"}
{"text":"Tucked away in the corner of bustling Yonge Street lies a fantastic sushi joint!  Reasons why I will definitely return: 1. Selection, selection, selection 2. Ambiance 3. Quick Service 4. Convenient 5. Absolutely Delicious 6. Affordable 7. Appetite satisfying 8. Large selection of veggie options  I really could go on and on, but I don't see the need.   Sushi One - I will return."}
{"text":"The lunch specials here are some of best deals you can find around in the area.   Today, I got the chicken katsu bento box and with tax and 15% tip it still came under $10. The chicken was supremely fried, not oily at all and was moist and juicy. The katsu sauce was amazing with the chicken and rice.   The consistent quality of the food is why it gets 5 stars. If you're expecting large portions, this isn't the place for you - especially if you're not here for AYCE, but that doesn't mean you won't here feeling satisfied. A full dining area during lunch time is a sure sign they're doing something right."}
{"text":"Forgive me Lord for I have sinned. (yes gluttony is a sin)  I came here with my friend for AYCE buffet. We started off with miso soup then ordered the usual, makis, sushis, sashimis, handrolls...etc. A-OK quality, what you expect from AYCE.  Funny story, We ordered 2 Kalbis but the waitress served us about a dozen!! a happy accident. They were delicious so I'm not complaining. Service was friendly but slow.  I suggest that you stick to a la carte. If you are going for AYCE then don't get carried away as their portions are huge compared to other AYCE sushi restaurants. Stay away from the Salmon pizza!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's cozy, affordable and staff is really friendly. Food is always fresh and it never takes long to be prepared. I've been to other restaurants in the neighborhood, but this is still my favorite! Best Green Dragon in Toronto!"}
{"text":"stopped there for lunch today. All you can eat on Fridays are $14.99 - regular weekday lunches are cheaper. There is no wrong answer with that price... but no unagi?! The horror. I also learnt that Inari is a tofu thing... I did secretly hope it was another way of spelling eel though. hmmm.  Service was good. The order came out super fast. The rolls were good. No complaints but I wasn't blown away by it. The rolls and maki all kind of tasted the same to be honest.   I would go back but stick to ordering sushi (fish was fresh) and OMG Kalbi... It is located in Korea town so beef ribs make sense and they were solid. I might have consumed a small cow - like a mini one.  Everything else was standard - yakitori, teriyaki, salads...etc.  I did have two bowls of green tea ice cream. I was sad when my second bowl didn't have shaved chocolate on it. Although at this point, that might have been the \"please go\" signal.  Roll out!"}
{"text":"I have been here a  number of times - ordered off both the menu and all you can eat.  1) The rolls given in AYCE orders are ridiculous. I have tried AYCE here three times - the roll is essentially all rice. There is almost no fish or filling. The quality of the roll is definitely different when you don't order AYCE, which isn't stated up front.   If you are going to offer AYCE, have it be the same quality or don't offer it all. As a customer, its a huge turn off.    2) When we came last time, their was two people next to us who ordered AYCE (this time my party was ordering bento boxes). The server asked them twice rudely if they were sure they wanted to order that much food.  The customers looked kind of uncomfortable, as the waitress was loudly embarrassing them. They confirmed their order. As they received it, I couldn't believe that the waitress had been so critical. They hadn't even ordered that much. It was SO rude. If it had been me, I would have gotten up and left.   3) Getting your tea refilled or having your server come by takes a miracle.   4) The plain rolls are much better than than the more 'creative rolls' that are over sauced and salty.  I do still come here for a quick take out of bento box or bibimbap, mostly because of convenience. After a few negative experiences (the shaming of the customer being the last straw), i have decided to stop coming in - especially for dining in.  There is much better quality sushi and reasonable value in the area. Not sure why someone would choose this place over another."}
{"text":"I like this place l! One you walk in you get a warm welcome. The food is pretty good and the service is great. I order the hot sake and it's hot . Just the way it should be. Price is average for Yonge st. The atmosphere is makes me cozy inside. I will probably come again."}
{"text":"I went here this past Sunday with a few friends. Definitely don't judge a book by its cover. The outside and decor is a little tacky but the service and food makes up for it. My friends and I got the all you can eat for $20.99. They had a really good selection for lunch, some specialty rolls. What I really like is that the special rolls come in 4 pieces so you can try a lot of different rolls without getting too much food. The sushi had a great fish to rice ratio, not too much rice and the presentation of the food was beautiful. Great service here! Super attentive and patient. We had a really nice server who was really generous with the ginger. My only con is that there is a limit on some of the food items like Kalbi. I would definitely come back here again !"}
{"text":"*THIS REVIEW IS ZERO STARS*   I am extremely disappointed with this place. I choose this sushi restaurant over another one in my area based on the reviews and I am appalled at how bad the sushi is. We ordered delivery; a party tray and a red Dragon roll. We wanted to change all the shashimi to all salmon but they were gonna charge us 5 bucks so we didn't even bother and thank God for that. The fish is really not fresh and even taste like mush. The fish was so un-fresh that the tuna pieces weren't even the same colour, one was dark brown! Like it's been sitting in the fridge for a while. The red Dragon roll had this weird taste to it that I did not enjoy at all. I will never order form this sushi place again."}
{"text":"Updating my review. I normally go in to have bento boxes and they are not bad. Recently I went in to have AYCE buffet with my fiance. I have to say I hate it when they wanna charge you for wasting 1 piece of sushi, how cheap that is! I don't think I will go there again for AYCE sushi. The fish is not fresh, we had a salmon salad once and the salmon was so fishy. We couldn't finish it. Had to throw it out."}
{"text":"It used to be the go- to place but it got too heavy on the wallet and portions got smaller. If you want a great sushi place, go to sushi bong!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times.  They had groupons so I bought a couple.  i didn't find anything wrong with the place but there wasn't anything that stood out.  Sadly, it is in an geographic area where there are plenty of other sushi options to choose from and I haven't been compelled to go. I will certainly say that if I am with someone who chooses this place, there will be no objections from me."}
{"text":"Good sushi place. Sashimi is in nice big chunks which is my favorite way to have it. A little on the expensive side though."}
{"text":"They have this rule in place that the whole table should order from the same menu...either from the menu, or AYCE."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was good. I usually do all u can eat but left here full and with leftovers for less than I usually pay at the all u can eat."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try for some take-out, despite the fact that it's right across the street from my favourite sushi bar in the city, Sushi Moto, as I was heading south and didn't want to bother crossing the boulevard at night. The restaurant is clean and the staff was friendly, and it was busy, always a good sign for a sushi restaurant. It took longer than I would have liked to get my food, but it was definitely tasty. I tried the spicy tuna rolls and the spicy scallop rolls. The tuna rolls were the superior of the two. It was good, overall. I certainly wasn't disappointed, and I would go back. Generally, I much prefer Moto, despite the fact that Moto is a little pricer, but the bar makes up for it in ambience, size, vibe, taste, and the extent of the bar, especially the single malts and the sake selection."}
{"text":"I am extremely picky about sushi restaurants because I used to work at a Japanese sushi place and also had sushi and sashimi in Vancouver, BC for over 6 months.   First of all, I have admitted that this restaurant is always busy. Many of my friends recommend me to visit here since it's one of the best sushi places in the area. Their menu is well designed for different customers. Some of the photos posted here really display the look of the food well.   My co-workers and I were in the area for lunch, so we ordered 3 dishes from the lunch menu. The price related to the portion of the bento box is fairly reasonable. For average diners, one order of the bento box is enough for lunch, and the price including the tax and tips will be roughly around $15.   I wouldn't say it's super special in terms of the taste compared to the ones in BC, but in the area here, it is certainly a go-to place for lunch or dinner with friends."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for like 10 years, since they opened. I even had a little \"free meal\" card which I don't think they give anymore.  Anyway - over all I keep going to this place because they have a lunch special that is weekdays + weekends until 3 or 3:30 compared to other places that end a bit earlier. That being said, the sushi was consistently been a 4/5. Certainly you'll find better places in Mississauga or the GTA suburbs but Sushi one always has been consistently good. The rice is always the right temperature (my pet peeve is averted!) the fish is good. Their Korean-Japanese food is pretty good - I remember once the bulgogi wasn't good (but it was good most of the time).   The traditional appetizers are pretty good. Sometimes they give you extra - I'm not sure why? Haha.  The woman who serves you is really nice and been at it for a long time. They are open during civic holidays, so you know they're hustling all day, everyday for your business.  For lunch, you get a green tea ice cream which adds to the incredible value going here."}
{"text":"Love this place. We will usually get it delivered but I also like sitting on their patio in the summer. The bento box is great value, and delicious!"}
{"text":"This place gets busy dinner time Friday night. It's not like there's a shortage of sushi places here in K-town North. Sushi is decent enough, staff is friendly. Waitresses. Leggy. I'd go back."}
{"text":"My son and I come here sometimes. Awesome and comfortable place with friendly service and tasty food. They also have a very nice patio with large sun umbrellas. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We had ayce dinner. Food selection is kinda limited. Sashimi is good and fresh especially the butterfish. But they only allow you to order 10 pc sashimi per person on the same order sheet which I found very annoying. Korean kalbi beef is a must to try! It's limited 12 pc per person but it's enough to eat. they have many rolls so if you are a fan you will like there. I guess we won't go back because we love many kinds of sashimi and here is not for sashimi fans."}
{"text":"I didnt do the AYCE but amazing either way.  I ordered the white dragon which is a scallop sushi roll slightly grilled.  Sooo good!  Check this place out as a group and share their specialty sushis.  Great staff!"}
{"text":"The best sushi ever!! Especially their super salmon. I think I've tried all of their super rolls and am never disappointed. Course I have my favourites. And they have really yummy candy near the cash when I pick up my take out.  AYCE is new or relatively new. You don't have access to their speciality rolls but their sashimi is super fresh and good sized portions. Although they limit the number of sashimi you can make per order.  Prices went up lately which is unfortunate but I think that's everywhere lately."}
{"text":"Went around 5pm on a weekday for takeout. There was no one else in there and I really loved the vibe. The soy sauces were in cute little tea kettle looking things and the music playing was relaxing.  Also the sushi was really really great. I had the spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls."}
{"text":"I'd come back for the patio and a la carte. But definitely not for the ayce menu. There's not as many options on the menu compared to other restaurants."}
{"text":"I will be a loyal customer as long as you keep the couple dinner set meal with the app, wine, meat and sushi for the same price. Good value and consistency. Keep it up"}
{"text":"This restaurant is sometimes a 3.5 and sometimes a 4. I do like the sushi and sashimi here. They're pretty fresh, tasty, and priced for good value. They have great lunch sets and specials. Service is pretty good considering they are really busy during weekday lunch hours. They're not a fancy sushi restaurant but good for everyday sushi. Summer time the patio is open and it's nice to sit outside and enjoy some tasty Japanese food."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a Saturday night for the AYCE sushi. Although the place was crowded, we were seated immediately, albeit on one of the small centre tables. The staff was friendly and the service was prompt! That's good!  We ordered from all over the menu including soups, salads, teriyaki and tempura. The sushi rolls were very fresh and of decent portions. Unlike places where there is a thick coating of rice, here everything was portioned proportionally! The dynamite and the black dragon rolls were some of our favorites!   The prices were average for a weekend night AYCE and the experience was good! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  Sushi One, we can say, is Sushi Moto's competitor, located across the street from that restaurant. Sushi One has a large patio, and it was open for lunch earlier this week due to the (finally) warm weather.  The setup is a bit weird; you have to walk to the middle of the restaurant for the \"front\" desk, at least that's what I had to do. Either way I was seated promptly (and actually had one of the last seats in the restaurant), and was offered tea to start.  While the lunch specials were appetizing, I opted for the sushi silver, since I only wanted sushi and rolls. It came with a miso soup, salad, and a spicy salmon hand roll.  The miso soup and salad weren't anything spectacular, but a good start nonetheless. The spicy salmon hand roll didn't feel that spicy, but the avocado was a little bit on the bland side. The salmon was excellent though.  The sushi silver platter came with 6 pieces of california roll, and salmon, tuna, shrimp, yellow tail, and red snapper sushi pieces. All the fish tasted excellent as well as the rolls! My only complaint was that the rice was a little bit hard, but still chewable.  It was tough for me to give either a 3 or 3.5, but if I was talking about comparing to Sushi Moto (which I gave a 3), I like this place more, at least for lunch. 3.5 it is, plus the .5 for the excellent service I received."}
{"text":"Not my favorite spot anymore, prices shot up for AYCE and they only serve it after 4 pm now. As well, last time we had lunch there it wasn't as good as it used to be. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless they bring back the same kind of service they had before. The food was mediocre at best, why would I dish out $30 for something for that? Anyhow, it was good while it lasted, moving on!"}
{"text":"Sushi One gets points for having some nice decor and good service, but it didn't make up for the food.  The fried tofu appetizer was ok and I liked the sauce it was in - more than the overly salty soy sauce for my sashimi.  The sashimi itself was decently fresh but I was not impressed at all at the ghettoness of the salad which consisted flatly of lettuce and shredded carrots in a weak \"ginger\" dressing in a plastic bowl.  The miso soup tasted like something from a can.  It's a good bang for your buck though, and if I were to come back I'd try the kitchen food."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for years now but for some reason I haven't written a review yet =S. Here goes!  I always order the same thing every time I eat here...the sushi dinner 128. It comes with 6 california rolls, 6 dynamite rolls, and 6 spicy tuna rolls. I never end up finishing it up in one sitting so I end up eating the remaining as a late night snack haha. The sushi here is always prepared fresh and the raw fish is fresh as well (I hope!). When you order this dinner, it comes with 4 mini appetizers and the miso soup. The appetizers that taste yummy are the bean sprouts and the seaweed. I'm not a fan of the beans and salad. They also serve complimentary green tea ice cream after your meal.  The service here is pretty good most of the time. Since it's owned by a Korean family, the wife is usually the only one who is serving everyone. It doesn't get really busy here so it's not a problem having just one server."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town ever. Cant stop coming to this place its been five years im trying all sushi places but nothing cant beat this"}
{"text":"Pretty decent, lunch menu is great... Haven't done ayce yet but am willing to try!!!  Don't ask for substitutions it's 2.50 extra even if u just wanna change something to just Avacado when it's leaving out one ingredient ... Only issue  Miso soup is a bit salty lol"}
{"text":"Order Korean BBQ with salad and rice. Great combo with soup. The service is nice but a little expensive for dinner"}
{"text":"i love this place, One of my favorite place's in the area. I've been here 3 times now and each time i wasn't disappointed. I ordered the dinner bento box all 3 times. First time the chicken and the other 2 times were steak, The steak was good, The Cali roll that came with it was fresh tasting, I LOVE the fact that even though it says i think .... 4 pieces of Tempura, They always put EXTRA I love when they do that, the rice taste fresh and the dip that came with the tempura was good. Soup was simple and good. I also ordered the fried calamari which was really great. we've had the dumplings.... they were ..... okay. prices were okay."}
{"text":"First time visiting Sushi One for lunch, service was fast and friendly, portions are bigger then the standard, reasonable price. I had the chicken terriyaki bento box deluxe and other sushi dishes, I was not disappointed. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Nothing crazy,  it's okay sushi. I've had much better and it's little pricey. It didn't seem very fresh and rolls smaller than normal. Plus had some wierd smell. I'd try another sushi places since there are lot of places that are better"}
{"text":"The weekday specials here are good but there isn't much on the weekend. The menu prices are pretty high compared to places downtown like Sushi on Bloor. Unfortunately the quality and portion sizes don't really make up for that, but it's not bad.  If you're in the area, Sushi Moto across the street is more swanky, but Sushi One is slightly less expensive than that. This place is pretty average; I can't think of anything that makes it stand out. Sometimes location is all you need to survive."}
{"text":"I've been here a few time in the past, but decided to revisit it based on the reviews here.  Sort of a mistake!  First, as soon as I walked in, I got hit with this mouldy wet mop/soiled diaper/baby barf smell.  Gross.  Already a big hit to my appetite.  Upon review of the menu, prices are quite reasonable.  Lunch menu is available on the weekends, which is probably 1 of the reasons this joint was busy on a Sunday afternoon.  Another reason for its popularity is probably the convenient location.  Just down the street from Hinote, my fav sushi place in Mississauga, Sushi One offers more pieces for less $$$.  For example, lunch at Hinote 11 pieces (8 nigiri/3 maki) - $11.99, Sushi One - 18 (9 nigiri/3 salmon/3 cali) - $11.99.  Both come with soup/salad, but Sushi One includes Korean side dishes.    Keep in mind that the cuts of fish at Hinote are much more generous, whereas Sushi One, the fish are smaller, with a bigger chunk of rice in the nigiri.  Even though there are only 3 pieces of nigiri at Hinote, they are much bigger than the 6 tiny pieces at Sushi One.  Quality-wise:  I think Sushi One pre-makes some of their nigiri as certain pieces, like shrimp & surf clam as they were dry and fell apart from the bed of rice.  :(  The other nigiris weren't that most moist either.  (The sushi reminded me of T&T - not a good thing!)  Complimentary green tea ice cream was served after the meal, but it was pre-scoped and came from the freezer.  :(    Cleanliness:  The mildew smell persisted in the narrow hall leading to the washroom.  I didn't want to look too closely, but I saw a bucket (for a mop), bowls stacked on top of each other, a book that someone was readying, a jacket, all just sprawled to the side.  The grout on the floor of the washroom was black.  So one can only guess what goes on in the kitchen!  Honestly, I didn't really ENJOY my food.  I just ate it and left, so I don't think I'll go back even though you do get a lot of food.  (Maybe the Korean food is better??)  However, quality-wise, you do get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"I used to live in the neighbourhood so I've been to this place more times than I can remember. It's a small restaurant, and easy to miss if you don't live in the area. The sushi is high quality, and delicious, and you pay for this quality. They have some good combos. Excellent place for consistently great sushi. The service is average."}
{"text":"I ordered take out here last night, and was completely satisfied by the quality and freshness of the sushi rolls. I ordered the Special Maki Set, which included spicy salmon rolls, spicy tuna rolls, and shrimp tempura rolls, and all of them were excellent! Moreover, Sushi One has the best service I've ever received at a sushi restaurant. All the servers wear traditional clothing, and the decor is very pretty too :) Great experience."}
{"text":"Okay, I have only ever ordered food from Sushi One, never been to the actual restaurant. I've had pretty mixed service in terms of delivery time, but they usually tell you when you order the approximate time of delivery.   Anyway, ordering aside, we keep ordering from Sushi One because the food is consistently good.   We have been ordering from them for years and they switched management some time ago (over a year I think at this point). At first we weren't so sure. The food quality sort of lacked, but they've picked it up and I think the food is great again.   Yeah, so no complaints. Yummy sushi if you're in the North York area. Win-win!"}
{"text":"**3.5 stars**  Friday night's are busy at this restaurant. I was surprised to find that there was a 20 minute wait, considering there are plenty of sushi restaurants nearby. The service was decent and the menu looked enticing so I decided to wait it out and see what all the buzz was about.  I was pleasantly surprised by their unique variety of sushi rolls. We did not opt for the all-you-can-eat option (although still a good deal) because the Bento Box selection was what caught my eye. I ordered the Dinner Bento Box A and my friend ordered the Gold Maki set - delicious!   Considering I've lived in both Japan & Vancouver - cities with the best sushi - this place definitely gets my blessing and will be my go-to sushi restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The ayce here is good with a reasonable price  Salmon teriyaki is soooo good, the thickest salmon teriyaki I have ever tried in ayce, the sushi and rolls r good, service is nice But might not come here again coz its far from my house and there're too many good restaurants around it"}
{"text":"I grocery shop at the No Frills that's in the same plaza & I've seen this place a lot. One day my boyfriend & I decided to walk in.   At first the food was good - this was a year or two ago - the service was also good.   We've been noticing the quality has been changing. For instance, they give you little complimentary appetizer dishes before the main dish comes out: red beans, cabbage, seaweed, tofu & bean sprouts - more recently they've been looking old & some taste AWFUL.   Some raw fish dishes have left us with severely upset stomachs. It is pretty obvious the sashimi they are serving is not fresh.   Recently they messed up the order & the lady who was serving us - she's the usual one there - was RUDE. She was arguing with us & insisted we were wrong. At the end she THREW the bill at us & didn't give the green tea ice cream that's normally provided at the end of the bill.   I wouldn't go back to this place again. The quality of food has declined & the service is just not even there."}
{"text":"This was once a great place but over the years have gone downhill.  I had recently and I must say that all the portions have become super small.  We ordered two bento boxes for lunch, and when it came we were blown away how small the portions were.  Even the white rice, YES! white rice was a mini cupcake size, a two biter.  The noodle side dish that comes in the bento box was literally one bite.  I felt I we ordered a sampler. like we were at Costco but cost $18.  The physical structure of the Bento box is black and when our meal came there was more black space than any other color.  Went to McDonalds next door right after."}
{"text":"Closest sushi spot after gym and we went in for their ayce menu on a Saturday. Promptly greeted upon entering the place and service from beginning to end was wonderful!   Wasabi spice factor hit the spot! POW! Sinuses and colds felt threatened which brought justice to my sole purpose in opting for protein and kick ass natural remedy. Fack you winterrrrrrr!!  Sashimi was fairly fresh (huge mackerel slices YUM!), my fave is normally the green dragon roll but unfortunately did not enjoy this at Sushi One. It was made with sweet (teriyaki?) sauce drizzled on top and tasted like avocado dessert with rice.   Their dinner menu is not as extensive as other places, considering the price is $23pp.  Pop is included Fri-Sun if you like fizz with your sea creatures. Green tea is still preferred.  Ps. Don't order the calamari- tasted like rubber but do get the fried rice! It was fried perfectly with a garlicky kick."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, great quality for the price, excellent service. I think this may be the best budget sushi place I've been to in Toronto. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Didn't have any expectations going on but was happy with our order. Double Dragon was very good, beef roll was good but not amazing.  It was a bit pricer than I expected. Small space."}
{"text":"This is my sushi choice if I'm seeing a movie at the Shephard Grande theater. Amazing prices, huge portions. They have really good lunch specials.   It's not the best sushi ever, but it's probably the best or second best sushi place in the area.   3.5 stars."}
{"text":"material was very fresh and delicious. But the sizes were very big to have them in one shot! another point was that there was not a very big difference between the taste of different suchies! you could find the same overloaded material in each and every Suchi."}
{"text":"While the quality of the food has gotten better, it's still not as amazing as when they first opened. Oh well. They're a good option for cheap food. Plus they deliver!"}
{"text":"The place was okay the service was above average but the salad I asked for was the one you can get at no frills for 2.99, the one I got was spoiled, even the smell showed it was rotten, I asked for a new one because that one was bad and they charged me for extra because I didn't eat it and I order another one, bad experience"}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting this place to be such a hit. Don't judge a book by its cover! Interior is cozy and casual. 6 adults and 2 toddlers opted for the AYCE lunch menu. Service was excellent, and food was very good. They even gave the toddlers their own plate and cup set which they enjoyed. They served all our sushi on 1 massive plate which was very instagram worthy- too bad no one took a photo of it. Even with a big group, they were able to separate the bills for us. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I used to come here almost everyday after class - I looove Sushi One! So sad that I usually don't come back to this area anymore since I moved and graduated.   Stopped by again this weekend, and I was just reminded why I love this place so much! I always order the chicken yaki udon noodles - this is THE udon dish that started my crazy obsession with udon noodles lol! The portion is really big, and so worth the $11.99. I always have a hard time finishing it but it's so damn good, I force myself .   I also ordered the seafood yaki udon for my boyfriend. They don't put much seafood in this one, as there was only 1 mussel, a few tiny shrimps and very thin slices of crab sticks. For $13.99, this doesn't seem as worth it as the chicken. However there is still a tremendous amount of udon noodles to get my boyfriend full. I really recommend trying the udon noodles if you come here!   I always order the spicy salmon roll too - tastes so fresh and good. I never tried any other roll, but I probably will on my next visit :)  Though I ordered take out, I still saw other customers being served their yummy appetizers! Can't wait to go back and dine in to get the complimentary appetizers and green tea ice cream after my meal.  Service is also good. There's always just one server who is a very sweet lady!   Overall, I strongly recommend this place - especially for their udon noodles and sushi!"}
{"text":"The sushi here is definitely top notch. When I used to live in the area I would visit this wonderful little spot a couple times a month.  The quality of the sushi is great and the portions are fairly sizeable.  The service here has consistently been friendly, polite and informative.  I have since moved and will miss this place tremendously. 4 stars"}
{"text":"The quality of the sushi here is a step above your average sushi joint. The deluxe sashimi ($21.99 for 24 pieces) was very good. There was a good selection of very nice and very fresh fish. The slices were a good size. The beef BiBimBap ($11.50) was also very good. The house wine is not great (Kressmann), but at $5 a glass you really can't complain. Besides, I prefer the hot sake ($9.99 for a large.) The service is alright, even tough the servers seem to all rotate between the tables. They wear nice traditional-type cloths. The ambiance is just fine, albeit a bit on the casual side with the TVs on, and the cheesy rock playing out of a single small speaker. They do have an AYCE option for $27.99 or $29.99 on the weekend. It seems on the expensive side, but the selection seems diverse, and if the quality is as consistent it might actually be worth it."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Toronto I make sure to come to sushi one!! Soo soo yummy with good service! They're volcano roll and the curry udon is my favorite!"}
{"text":"My second, after a long time, visit to Sushi One. My first one was for a birthday party and it was decided based on being hailed as the best AYCE sushi at the time (and we had a great time). Coming back, I've seen they haven't been slacking. Plating, quality of the menu overall has also grown. They've also kept up with the torched/aburi trends, offering their own torched nigiri and oshizushi. I would say they need to go easy on the sauce (that blob of herb sauce, while was enjoyable to me, was scraped off by my friends who stated it was too strong---maybe moderate dots over the nigiri next time!). Service, despite being paper-order-driven was reasonably quick and accurate. As I've grown more accustomed to the higher quality of sushi of a la carte places, Sushi One is one of the few I can say gives their utmost, regardless of whether you dine AYCE or a la carte."}
{"text":"Great little Sushi Joint  Ordered take out and received great service along with good quality sushi. Avocado rolls were only $3.50   Walked in late this evening and it was pretty busy.  Xoxo thank u sushi one"}
{"text":"I order Sushi One for delivery all the time. I just had it for dinner again tonight and had to post this as it was amazing. Sushi sashimi, butterfish sashimi, spicy tuna hand roll, salmon pizza, black dragon roll - fresh, melt-in-your mouth deliciousness."}
{"text":"The portions are big, especially the Salmon Sushi Pizza. One is more than enough for 2 people. Good quality sushi, but the service is really slow. I was denied access to patio, simply because the waitress did not feel like serving the patio and wanted to make her job easier, by sticking to one spot. Also, they didn't bring Green tea until I ask them about it. Pretty much every sushi place I've gone to, I've been served with Green tea first. I might come back here, but would only order a la carte and not AYCE. The Korean beef was the highlight of dinner. One hand roll is a meal on its own and will fill you up."}
{"text":"In general, the sushi and kitchen foods are quite general with basic stuffs for AYCE. So I don't think it's worth the weekend price, but maybe because of its location so it has to be that high ($26). For me I could find another place with better foods for the same price. However, the sashimi is very fresh, especially the marinated saba (mackerel). It was really good as the taste of sashimi is more flavorful compared to other AYCE places. I just don't like the fact we can only order 20 pieces each time.  In addition, the service could be improved. The servers are nice but they need to keep it better by providing us order sheet regularly. We had to keep asking for it.   In general, it was a really decent meal although I don't think I wouldn't come back, maybe just for a la carte maki roll only."}
{"text":"I ordered a party tray for dinner in addition to a red dragon roll. I was not impressed by the quality of the food. I felt the fish was not fresh.  I observed that one if the pieces of tuna had a very dark discoloration and it tired like it was just sitting somewhere for hours not refrigerated.  Also,  the rice had a very weird taste to it.   The food we got did not reflect the previous reviews given by the other yelpers. The sushi we got in this instance was an atrocity to all things sushi and the food was definately not prepared with any love.   I don't think I will be ordering delivery from them again.  However,  since most of the reviews where based on a dine in experience, I will give it a shot there."}
{"text":"not sure how to rate raw fishi but it appears to be fresh? i come here often cause it's close by and they have friendly service staff. Not a very busy spot most likely because of its location hidden in a ghetto plaza near mavis and englinton. they serve complimentary greentea ice cream after meals but the ice cream is really frozen so its difficult to get at with a plastic spoon. This one is not all you can eat but def worth a try. Any of the specialty rolls are delicous"}
{"text":"Amazing! Love their Diablo roll, but everything I've tried so far is really good. Recommended hands down!"}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch and I had high expectations... I assumed because it was a small sushi restaurant that it would be a hidden gem. Nope.. that wasn't the case at All humans. They gave us green tea in the beggining.. didn't ask us for drinks or nothing but that was okay, since I ate the food and knew that I didn't want to stay any longer.. my seaweed salad was the worst I've ever had.. my tex mex roll had imitation crab in it.. Once again.. I dislike imitation crab very much and if I would have read it thoroughly I wouldn't have ordered it.. of course I didn't read it at all, so I didn't really feel to bad when I asked her to take it back.. the service was okay at first and then oddly rude.. non attentive.. the miso soup was a bit on the salty side which I love but this is the worst sushi restaurant and first time I've had bad sushi.. the sashimi seemed fresh but a bit stringy and I don't like that. The spicy tuna roll looked like mush and lacked flavor that I am use to in sushi. I don't reccomend this place at all and believe me.. it's not because of the customer service.. I did find her a bit caught off guard and what not but it's the food.. it lacks real flavor. The beef teriyaki was okay. My friend's chicken teriyaki was dcent but I've had better. I really disliked the food. I wish I got to like one thing but everything was bland and boring and didn't excite me at all. I felt cheated but I know better now"}
{"text":"Nice little place, service is always fast and friendly. Food is good, dinner portions are big. Ninja roll is a must try! Take out always ready really fast. They bring you free appetizer dishes and serve korean food too. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Meh, I work around this area, and I am a sushi lover and this is pretty much the only casual sushi sit down restaurant (other than sushi moto across the street) to go to. I find it overpriced for the amount and quality of food. Its always extremely busy during the weekdays lunch, and sometimes we end up spending half of our lunch just waiting to be seated! It is so small. So, I would not come here if I had a choice but if it were for a friend or just because its convienient, then fine."}
{"text":"I've mentioned before that this place isn't very consistent but they've really stepped it up in the last several months. The standouts here include most of the special rolls (especially the red dragon roll), the bulgogi, teriyaki dishes, chap chae, spicy salmon roll, and of course the complimentary Korean side dishes that they give you at the beginning of the meal. I also love the green tea ice cream you get at the end. The red Dragon roll again is probably the best one I've had anywhere. It's huge and delicious. The only dishes I didn't really like here were the udon and their Boston roll. The side dishes and rolls used to be inconsistent when the part time sushi chef because they would be smaller and fall apart but the owner really gets it right. Also the side dishes used to be fresh only half the time but it looks like they have some quality control now. The salad is still a sour mess and the miso soup overly salty sometimes so they could work on that. The prices are very fair for what you get."}
{"text":"We've only ordered delivery... and we're vegetarian. We usually grab the veg bento box with a mix of apps and rolls. Love the pan fried spinach and mushroom - great variety in both, not too salty. Croquettes, gyoza, lots of goodies to chose from, which is awesome for a veg. Their udon soups are very tasty. Their delivery time is consistently shockingly phenomenal! On Mother's Day they said they'd be about an hr and half - very unusual. We ordered anyways and they showed up in half hour."}
{"text":"There are too many sushi restaurants around for such quality. Sushi tastes slightly stale and looks like it was thrown together. What was more disappointing, is when I order a 16 piece sushi platter and end up with less than 16 pieces. I understand they're only humans and make mistakes once in a while (and it's honestly not the biggest deal), but when I pointed it to the chef, he gives me the most half-assed rice with fish eggs \"sushi\". Also, of the 16 pieces, six of them were the exact same fish. Not much of a variety."}
{"text":"Returned for a lunch here last Saturday, in a party of 6.  It wasn't busy at all (there were maybe 3 tables only), but we felt rushed by our server. She served us green tea ice cream without asking us early, and also before half of us had completed our entrées.   And she also gave us our bill soon after - before we were done. I can understand it if they were busy and needed the table. Or if some of us were leaving early and needed  the bill sooner. Her overall demeanour was very curt.  One new change we noticed too - also negative - is: ban chans (the small korean appetizer dishes) will cost extra after one refill. ($2 per additional refill) Everyone in our party was pretty shocked at this, as traditionally ban chans are unlimited.  In general, I may still come back but am disappointed to see these new changes at Sushi One. Will consider other options next time before returning for another meal."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a Monday night.  I had miso soup and two different types of vegetarian sushi.  I was really happy that this place offers brown rice for an additional charge ($3).  Both types were good, the tofu was delicious.  The other person dining with me also enjoyed his Dynamite roll and Crunchy roll.  Really great price for some decent sushi.  Service was decent as well as decor."}
{"text":"What to say about a place we tend to eat at twice a week? Well - my husband and I don't eat dairy so this place has become our 'pizza' joint. The price and quality match (low balanced with delicious) - the silver sushi never fails and the chirashi is great as long as the rice isn't right out of the cooker.   We remain hooked..."}
