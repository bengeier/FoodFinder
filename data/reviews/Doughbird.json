{"text":"I've been here twice now.. it's ok. A typical fox restaurant. Loud, overpriced, typically full of a younger crowd that has their lack of soul searching proudly painted on their faces.. there's much better pizza in the Arcadia Phoenix area if you have the disposable income that this place requires"}
{"text":"Pizza was incredible and the place itself was very cool. Unfortunately they didn't seem super organized. It's a newer restaurant so I get they're still working things out, but we had a reservation and still had to wait 15 minutes past our reservation time (on a Thursday) and then it was at least a half hour wait for our food once we ordered. The waitress kept telling us it was about to come out and then it would be another 10 minutes each time. When our food finally did come out the pizzas were cold. They remade my pizza but there was no offer of compensation for the massive wait to then be delivered cold food. The pizza (once hot) was really phenomenal and the only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 3 stars."}
{"text":"With so many restaurants available in Central Phoenix, it's near impossible to try everything Phoenix has to offer. I am familiar with the Fox Restaurants and wanted to give Doughbird a try. We ordered the buffalo chicken wings and BBQ chicken pizza. The pizza had a ton of flavor and the wings were saucy & cooked to perfection. Our server was Taylor and she provided exceptional service. She was attentive, cordial and really provided a great experience. One of the best servers we have had recently. We'll be back Doughbird!"}
{"text":"The salad was great and the pizza was good. Upscale lunch place for Fox and it was quite busy the day I went. The service was awesome. We sat at the bar and the bartender was there for anything we needed. The only complaint was it was pretty noisy."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've been here 4x in their first two weeks. Oh wait. Yes I can. It's super good. 

Must-trys: 

Shishito Peppers. Ultra simple appetizer but the most flavorful thing I've ever had. 

Brussel Sprout Pizza: Sounds weird but their expert execution of the unconventional combination with bacon, pistachio and sweet potato pur√©e is genius. 

Prime Rib Dip: Like a French Dip but 100x better. Their bread is amazing, horseradish creme fraiche is unreal and the meat is cooked perfectly. 

Overall, I'm so impressed. I'm having a hard time deciding what to try next since everything I've had is incredible. Well done."}
{"text":"Good food and enjoyable dinner. We came here with a toddler and the waiter was just great!"}
{"text":"Thanks, Sam. I was skeptical of how this concept would come together, but you pulled it off. Tonight was my fourth visit and the experience was on point. First let me say that I love the coordination of servers, and tonight Ryan gave a stellar performance. I wish I remembered the staff from previous visits to mention them as well.  Great job, people. I've had the prime rib, rotisserie chicken, and several pizzas including the Burrata, Aviator, Margherita, and Spiral Ham. Being from Chicago, I don't like people messing with my pizza but these are worth it. Not too doughy, not too saucy, not too cheesy. The rotisserie chicken has been moist both times I've had it. I love getting at least three sauces to go with it. The cauliflower mash is awesome. The truffle cheese Stromboli to start with is a great idea....ours was a little small for the price but the flavor was pleasantly surprising. I've also had the wings which you think would be typical, but not at all. They are very worth tasting. We'll be back again for another pitcher of Moon To go along with the smorgasbord."}
{"text":"Tasty food. Good vibe. A little pricy though.

I had the pastrami sandwich and it was very very good."}
{"text":"The service and ambiance are very good, but my food was disgusting.  I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich.  It had no chicken meat, no BBQ sauce, and the bread was so mushy that I couldn't pick it up.  The chicken was nothing but a thin layer of chicken fat and skin mixed with a lot of mayo.  The french fries were very good, and everyone else at my table enjoyed their food.  The manager was friendly, and comped my sandwich.  The restaurant handled everything well, but my dish should never have made it to the table."}
{"text":"This review is probably contrary to other reviews but the food was amazing had the Lebanese Hummus probably the best I have ever had. The problem is that the pita serving is not enough to fully enjoy the plate. As a matter of fact the waiter suggested an extra serving which we agreed upon then he neglected to input the order. Ok so we all can make mistakes but the food was served and no server provided any type of follow up. As a matter of fact I had to intentionally make eye contact with another server to request the extra serving of pita. The other downer is that there is no happy hour so the pricing was quite expensive for the serving. Ordered a glass of wine which was alright. Overall more than likely the service experience was such a turn off I have no plans to return. If you decide to give them a try I hope your experience is better. Be Humble my friends."}
{"text":"I've been to a few other Fox concepts and they've always been OK

The pizza here was way too oily. For the same price you can go to pizzeria Bianca in Phoenix for pizza that is 100x better. 

We also got the prime rib sandwich which was good and the only reason they are getting 3 stars. 

Doesn't seem worth the $50 bill for a pizza, sand which, and a tiny drink"}
{"text":"We went opening night and expected it to be a little rough around the edges while the staff was still getting into their groove but service was wonderful and the food was excellent! We got a pizza and rotisserie chicken - they did not disappoint - but the dipping sauces are amazing and should be ordered with everything!"}
{"text":"FRC is killing it with this concept. Been twice this week. Probably my favorite concept of theirs to date. Wish they had one in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"I've had better pizza from other spots and better rotisserie chicken from Safeway or Costco for much $$$$"}
{"text":"We had a pizza with Brussels sprouts. Really good. Great service. Only drawback was Kids menu is pretty pricey especially since is doesn't come with a drink. $2 for a kids drink. $9 total for a toddler meal is not working for me."}
{"text":"Came here with the family we ordered 2 whole chickens which probably can feed 6 people easily. We also ordered 4 sides and 2 pizzas. The pizzas were excellent and so was the brussel sprouts. The potato wedges, mac and cheese and tabouli were all good. 
The chicken was just ok, nothing special about it what so ever. Ambiance and service were excellent. Parking was annoying as the valet service took up all the parking spots. 
I would give doughbird 3.5 starts if I could and main reason is the chicken was just ok and if u take away the chicken this is just another fancy pizza place. 
Unlikely to come back here sorry to break to all you fox concept fans."}
{"text":"We went to Dough Bird for the first time on Mother's Day. The food was very good. I had the prime rib which was cooked perfectly accompanied by au jus and horseradish sauce. My wife had a salad with the rotisserie chicken. She said it was very good. Here's where they can improve service. There were 5 of us at the table. The server brought out 2 meals. A couple minutes later the 3rd meal was delivered and a couple minutes later the final 2 meals were delivered. I don't know why restaurant servers don't understand that this creates an uncomfortable situation at the table with the people who get their meals first wondering if they should eat or wait for the others. Please bring all the meals at once. The other thing I observed is the server bringing the dessert, served in a bowl, with his thumb in the bowl. I saw it at our table and at the table next to ours. Not a fan of fingers in my food."}
{"text":"The good is fresh and fantastic.  Service is great. I had the rotisserie chicken with the lemon and roasted garlic sauce.  OMG was my mouth singing!  Do not pass this place up anymore...... it is a must do!"}
{"text":"Visited Doughbird for the first time and I must say the food and service were excellent. When we arrived  the hostess told us it was a 1 hour wait. We decided to grab a drink at the bar and wait it out. 3 opened at the bar area so we decided to eat there. We were treated by Craig and his service was top notch. I usually don't do many reviews however it was imperative I recognize awesome service when it is conveyed. I highly recommend Doughbird and want to say don't hesitate to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"I don't typically get on Yelp and write reviews (obviously, this is the first review I've ever written), as I generally just read others... but after going and experiencing Doughbird, a rather unique experience for a Fox Concept (I mean, they're all unique, let's be real), I felt compelled to write one.

We absolutely LOVED the Apple & Goat Cheese salad, ingredients were super fresh; absolutely delicious. My wife and I then enjoyed Barbeque Chicken Pizza. Pretty basic, but you can't really mess up a BBQ Pizza, right? All in all the atmosphere of the restaurant as was expected, open concept, trendy fixings, clearly a Fox restaurant done right once again.

Our waitress Taylor was an absolute delight, which is really the reason my wife said \"we need to get on Yelp.\" Fantastic customer service from her. (Thanks Taylor!) We will be back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Doughbird, but it was really just \"okay\".  My waiter told me I could not go wrong with the chicken or the pizza, so I ordered both.  I was worried a half chicken would be way too much food, but I was surprised when the half chicken seemed small (especially for $17).  The chicken was good (juicy and not too salty) but not better than roast chicken at other places for less money. But, the chicken included a side.  The roasted Brussels sprouts and kale were delicious, except half were warm on the outside and ice cold on the inside.  Were they frozen going on to the grill?  Being a little underwhelmed I tried the Margherita Pizza.  It looked great but I found the sauce to be almost tasteless.  Maybe it was subtly seasoned? A second piece did not improve my opinion.  Overall I was very disappointed. Perhaps I caught them on an off night.  I give them an A for atmosphere and a C for taste and value."}
{"text":"We went the first week Doughbird opened. I ordered the Asian chicken pizza. The waiter was unsure how it came so I asked for breast meat. The waiter recommended the umami sauce for dipping. It wasn't a bad recommendation since the umami sauce had a very mild flavor.

My wife had a Garden Chop salad with rotisserie chicken. She was pleased with the taste.

Our waiter was prompt with service. For being only open a few days he had a lot of thoughts on the menu and was very aware of us and his other tables; he checked back in frequently, even asking how I liked his dipping sauce recommendation. 

Parking is a sparse; when we went they had a no charge valet there. It's an open space with nice visual accents. How does the ceiling float over the bar?

The only issue I have the point out is the metal dishware. It feels cheap to eat off of, sounds tiney when it hits the table or slides around, and reminds me of grade school service trays. If I'm eating a $16 pizza I'd like proper tableware. Overall we'll be back."}
{"text":"Went to dinner as a date night with my wife and service was really good the food was great as well will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I was there one day after opening day and it was crazy busy.  Had to circle and circle for a parking spot and then got cut off by some rude woman! I managed to keep my temper (mostly -- except for my middle finger).  Anyways, we had a reservation so there was no wait which was fortunate.  I had the whole chicken.  It was good, but it was just a roasted chicken.  Nothing outstanding.  Not much different than the cooked chicken you get at Costco.  The hummus was good, but also not more than one notch above many others serving hummus.  The mango (?) sauce that comes with the chicken was really good.  But that's about it.  Service was slow but in they're defense they just opened up so there are wrinkles to work out.
I won't go back to give Sam Fox more of my money any time soon until it slows down and gets some inspiration for the menu.  Speaking of Sam, doesn't it seem like all his newer restaurants are basically the same?  Thin pizza and salad.  BORING!"}
{"text":"Loved the prime rib sandwich! Mac and cheese was pretty delicious too. I also loved the Brussels. We got a dessert which was also amazing- something with Caramel I believe. Overall I was satisfied and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Great location. Quality food. Nice ambiance.

Very tiny menu. Overly expensive prices. Pushy staff.

I really wanted to like this place, but their menu was so uninspiring. It didn't keep me interested. Their prices are also a bit high considering what you're getting. Sure, it's well made, and I wouldn't mind paying extra to treat someone special, but I'd be concerned that they would be unable to find something that they would like on their very limited menu.

I also didn't appreciate how pushy the staff was when it came to asking if I wanted anything else, making suggestions on ordering additional items, asking again if I wanted anything else, asking if I wanted anything from the bar, asking if I'm SURE I don't want anything else, etc etc. I understand it's part of their job, but you CAN go too far."}
{"text":"The hummus was amazing with fresh pita. I had the pastrami pizza and it was perfectly crafted. The Gin and Tonic cocktail was made very well. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Sam Fox does it again. If you are reading this and a visitor to the valley try any Fox restaurant and you will see why they are all busy all the time. Doughbird is no exception. Every attention to detail has been executed in this new concept. Food was fantastic and service was superb. We went during off hours because his restaurants are always so popular and it had only been open a month. If you can go in between lunch and dinner on a Saturday you will be spoiled with the service. Don't miss out on the cocktails either. This is. Place you will want to come back again and again. New places can suffer from lack of organization or food prep but that is not the case. One giant YUM."}
{"text":"Listen, if this wasn't a Sam Fox restaurant it would be closed already. My only question is - do we really need a new restaurant that specializes in rotisserie chicken and pizza? If I am gonna get rotisserie chicken I can by a whole bird at Walmart that's pretty darn good for $5.99. Why in Gods name would I want to pay $17 for half a bird and a side and if I am going to pay $16 for a pizza I am going to Grimaldis. I had the prime rib dip for $17. First of all, the portion size of the prime rib was minimal and I got well done prime rib when I specifically asked for medium rare. The sandwich itself didn't taste like the prime rib dips I grew up with in NY. This sandwich was served in a pita pocket and the arugula just gave the sandwich an odd aftertaste. Even if it had tasted good, it would have not been worth the $17 I paid for it which I am sure will go to pay back the money that was spent to buy the land and build this place. If this place makes it then I will be amazed! I think Doughbird will suffer the same fate Modern Steak did."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of stopping into Dough Bird on Friday night. My friend and I were in rather early, so we didn't have to wait for a table. We ordered a pepperoni pizza and a Caesar salad. Initially, a margherita pizza with gluten friendly dough was dropped off and we weren't aware of this mistake, but it was FANTASTIC! When the pepperoni made its way to the table, it was even BETTER! We were served by Taylor, who took great care of us start to finish. All her recommendations were 100% accurate and she anticipated our needs before we even knew what we wanted. With her as your server, and a pepperoni pizza, you won't be disappointed at Dough Bird."}
{"text":"Food is really salty especially the hummus (good flavor otherwise). Pizza is pretty average and ours had a lot of cheese on it. Overall, might go back but not as good as the other fox restaurants."}
{"text":"The food was OK.  Nothing that I would say was so good that I want to come back here again just for the food, except maybe the vegetables which were very good.  If I am in the neighborhood and need to meet someone somewhere, I would go back here.  The chickens were very small and expensive.  The staff should be reminded that when they bring out take out containers for left overs, they should not put their fingers in the containers."}
{"text":"Of course, any Sam Fox restaurant is going to generate hype. Doughbird was featured on many TV shows and reviewed extensively. We had dinner here tonight, and here is my assessment. The interior is just stunning. You almost felt that you were by the sea with the light woods, beautiful floor and beadboard walls. The service is very, very good. Our server was just wonderful, knew the menu and was attentive. But the food is just average. After hearing about all of Sam's research on dishes to feature here, I was so disappointed. We started with the Garden Salad. It was fine, but too dry for my liking, thus tasteless. It was mainly vegtables, so at least it was healthy. Then our margarita pizza, half Italian sausag, came out and my first impression was that it tasted like Pomo, another restaurant in the Valley. Just average at best. The spots of fresh mozzarella is nice, but not enough to make this pizza really good. We had dessert, some peach strusel with a very small (not enough) scoop of vanilla ice cream. We won't be back unless friends want to try. Just not worth the drive or wait."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great, but food was just OK. I had the rotisserie prime rib for $27, and the meat was tender but the beef flavor was not quite right and the seasoning (maybe salt, garlic and onion powder?) struck the wrong note. I love prime rib, but I would not order it here again. We also ordered a couple sandwiches, a chicken caesar salad and some buffalo wings. The salad came out without chicken on it, and when we reminded the server the chicken came out later in a little bowl. One of the sandwiches came out 10 minutes after everyone else got their food. Wings were good.

Our server was very friendly and attentive, but the food and kitchen staff could be better."}
{"text":"Amazing food, drinks, and service! Our server was great, we loved the wings, pizza, and the margaritas. The only down side is it's a bit pricey ($15) for a pizza, other than that amazing!"}
{"text":"Love Doughbird! We've been here a few times now. You have to try the bbq chicken pizza, even if you don't normally like bbq chicken pizza. The flavors are exceptional! Since my first visit I've mastered the recipe to make at home but I still love coming here when I don't feel like cooking. The chicken Caesar salad is also very good."}
{"text":"Came here for date night and knowing it was a Friday we made reservations in advance. We were seated right away and the waiter was awesome. He was friendly and very attentive. The atmosphere is casual and not too loud great date spot. We ordered the half bird and pizza. Both came out great and tasted delicious. I was bummed about paying a extra dollar for sauce but we got the lemon garlic and the pineapple teriyaki and I would get both of them again in a heartbeat. We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and it was fantastic. Cant wait to go back and try a different pizza. All and all bang for your buck I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant. Food options are healthy and yummy. Decor is modern and fresh and the staff is some of the best we've ever had. This time we had their special...turkey dinner. Excellent!!"}
{"text":"Coming in with high exceptions, I'd say I was mostly satisfied. My friend and I split the chopped salad, which was very good. We also had a pizza -- which was also good. But I've had others (a sourdough crust pizza in particular) at another local business that I thought was far superior. 
For future it sounds like the chicken is worth a try. The atmosphere was super cute, and we got there early enough we had no wait."}
{"text":"Had lunch today at the Doughbird and....
Parking may be easier around the White House in DC. Awful.
Chicken Club was good but coleslaw was awful. Add a tea and tip and was out $23+.
Decor nice staff nice; overall I'll pass on a return visit."}
{"text":"Fox's newest concept specializes in pizza and rotisserie and doesn't stray far from the formula that has led to its other restaurants' success.  The menu includes a range of salads, sandwiches, veggies and sauces.  The food was definitely tasty, although the portions were underwhelming.  We ended up ordering extra sides of brussels and cauliflower mash (which was the best thing I tried).  The interior is sleek and comfortable.  I'll probably come back."}
{"text":"Went there Sunday afternoon and we will be back!

The chicken was fantastic and the prime rib was amazing, as were the sides of mashed potatoes and buttery corn.  Our meals were so good we decided to take out two other items for dinner...a prime rib sandwich and a chicken/avocado salad...both excellent.  

The prime rib sandwich was one of the absolute best sandwiches I've ever had...extremely flavorful and cooked to perfection.  Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had chicken and pizza to split. Aviator Pizza was underwhelming. Resembled frozen pizza from a box. The chicken was just chicken. Save yourself the money and get one from a grocery store. Probably worst Fox restaurant I've been to."}
{"text":"Way overrated.  $77 for a basic rotisserie chicken, basic pizza and a couple drinks.  I don't understand why this place is always so busy."}
{"text":"Looks like Sam Fox is half-a$$ing it again

I was looking forward to trying this place cause it looked good online.

I went with a friend on a monday night. Pretty packed.

I ordered the \"Asian Chicken\" pizza hoping to try something different that i couldn't find at one the 20 other pizza places in town. When it came i was extremely disappointed! Tastes like someone went across the street to Pei Wei and dumped their food onto a pizza before baking it. None of the flavors worked well together. Total mess!! Tasted like something you come up with after doing LSD. 

I only ate 2 slices, mostly because I was starving. Tried taking it home because i felt extremely guilty wasting food when other people in the world go hungry. but i ended up tossing it out because it was just so unappetizing I couldn't eat another slice. 

The crust however was decent so maybe one of their more boring/traditional pizzas might actually be okay. 

My friend got the chicken and he seemed to like it. So maybe try that. 

Just please skip the pizza i ordered. It made me question if anyone actually tasted the dishes before putting them on the menu? Or Maybe the Fox group was just in a rush to put out another \"restaurant\" ASAP and could care less about the food."}
{"text":"Another hit for Fox Restaurants. A great mix of chicken dishes with pizza and similar dishes. It's a little noisy but not deafening. I'd call it lively in a good way"}
{"text":"I had the wild mushroom pizza that was recommended by one of the employees. That pizza was very good and the dough was light sp it was not hard to finish the whole personal pizza. I will be back."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today and it was awesome. We had to wait about 10 min as it was busy. Service was great and food was delicious. Had the wings and the truffle pizza. Pizza crust was thin and flavorful. Wings were cooked perfectly. We are only here for a couple days but may go back. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"You guys took off the speciality pizzas. Your current pizzas I can get anywhere. Sadly I won't be returning now. Even worse, your staff told us they're disappointed in the changes."}
{"text":"This Sunday my family and I wanted to go somewhere different to eat and so we decided on Dough Bird. The restaurant is so cute and clean, and our sever Hunter was amazing and very helpful and helped me find something amazing to eat despite my food allergies. The rotisserie chicken was amazing and tender and the brussel sprouts were sweet and crispy. This meal hit the spot and I can't wait to come back soon!!"}
{"text":"The Garden Chop salad was delicious! We also tried the mushroom pizza and got a side of mac & cheese so we had a variety on our first visit. All three were tasty. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ummmm disappointing to say the least... 
Wow, so this is how it felt back in 1993 when CPK opened their fist stores and the public was impressed! The decor extremely canned and unimaginative, with food and service to match. It is now starting to get blatantly obvious that FOX is in the restaurant marketing business not the food business. I don't even really know what concept is still his? Sauce, North, Flowerchild and Trufood already is sold off. Doughbird feels like he had to come up with a concept fast. Very sad to see the \"local independent\" come to this."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Doughbird since it opened and boy oh boy was it a treat. My gf and I shared their buffalo wings and they were absolutely delicious. Not your average wings that's for sure- seasoned and cooked to perfection. Also, we each got pizza. We figured we better try as much as possible. I got the mushroom pizza which was fantastic (I'm allergic to tomatoes so my pizza selection is usually limited) and my gf got the pepperoni which I know she loved. They were both cooked just right and had fresh ingredients. We ended the night with their warmed cake (butterscotch I believe) and that was also pretty good. The only bummer is that it really didn't come out warm- but that minor detail didn't spoil anything for us. It's the great service that really keeps people going to fox's restaurants anyways. From the bussers to hostesses, everyone was very inviting and eager for us to be there. To recap: We will be back and we want to try more chicken next time!"}
{"text":"So I've have visited most of the Fox Concept's restaurants in the Valley and when I heard Doughbird opened up, I wanted to give it a try......and I was not impressed.  So I my wife and I wanted to get out and try something new.  I heard about this a while back from a co-worker, so we agreed to give this place a try.  So we stopped by on a Saturday afternoon.  The place wasn't that busy and we were seated pretty quickly.  From that point on, everything was a disappointment, from the lack luster service to the crappy food.

So we sat there for roughly 10 minutes before a waitress said..\"She'll be right with us\"  About another 5 minutes goes by.  She finally comes by.  She took down our drink orders and said \"She'll be back to take our orders\"  My wife and I reviewed the menu, wasn't really impressed, cause they mostly had pizza and chicken, with a few sandwich and salad choices.  If I wanted pizza, I would just go to the other FOX restaurant...North. So we finally flagged down the busboy to let the waitress know we are still waiting for our waters and we are ready to order.  So from first sitting down to ordering it literally took over 25 minutes.  Anyways, we wanted to give the food a chance, cause if the food is great, we can overlook the sh*tty service.  So we came here what they are known for.  We ordered the full rotisserie chicken for 24.00, since half of a chicken was 17.00 (wouldn't make much sense to order the half), we ordered the brussesl sprout with kale for 5.00 and the Prime Rib Dip for 17.00.  So after all that fiasco, the food finally came out........

The rotisserie chicken was cut nicely and looked amazing.  When you bit into it, the chicken was dry and had a weird gaming taste. It definitely didn't taste like the rotisserie chicken's I was used to. and I get them at Frys, Costco, Sprouts, and Whole Foods.  I would much rather eat chicken's from those places than coming back to here, and for 24.00 bucks, you can kiss my a$$.  The prime rib dip sandwich was a disgrace to its name.  It was dry and the sandwich fell apart.  It tastes more like dry roast beef than prime rib. Go to Stockyards or Charlestons or a REAL prime rib sandwich. The potato wedges were bland and cold.  Feel like they were out of the fryer for quite some time.  The side dish, brussels sprouts were decent and flavorful, but for 5 bucks, I'll pass next time.

Overall, what do you want me to say?  24.00 for a rotisserie chicken that you can spend 5.00 bucks at Costco, or 7.00 at Frys, or splurge and get a range free, organic chicken at Whole Foods for 15.00 bucks.  17.00 bucks for a wilted dried up sandwich?  What a joke.  That sandwich will probably go down as one of my worst sandwiches I've ever ate in my life.  Much rather gone to Fry's and get some Boarshead and cheese and made my own damn sandwich.  So combination of crappy service and overpriced chicken, this is a Fox Concept restaurant i will not be going back to."}
{"text":"Not a ton of vegan options here but it is amazing nonetheless. Even my non-vegan friends love the cauliflower and Brussels sprouts. The server was very sweet to make sure it was vegan too."}
{"text":"As the name implies, Pizza and Chicken - even if it doesn't.  Clean and fresh restaurant!  Kitchen is in open view right when you walk in, full bar on the opposite side.  Very spacious dining room, great for large groups, with outdoor dining space as well.

Staff is very friendly and helpful, greeted when we came and left, and our server was fantastic in helping us navigate the food and beverage choices.

We ordered family style; 4 Pizza's, 2 rotisserie chicken, side califlour mash, side corn, and 1 kids Cheese pizza.  That more than adequately fed 7 hungry adults and 2 kids!  

The pizza creations are very unique, and offer great flavor contrasts, with something to fit likely everyone.

The rotisserie chicken was juicy, and had a very delicious flavor.  In addition you have a choice of dipping sauces, we chose Umami and Buffalo - good balanced sauces to compliment the chicken (or tip - pizza crust!).

Kudos to the bartender for the great drinks.  Was a little hesitant to order the bourbon and bells in fear of the spice, had a good conversation with our server about it  - so had a great old fashioned.  The server came back by later and gave me a Bourbon and Bells to try and thought it was Ana amazing craft, definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic and the service was great!  Chop Salad and the MAC and Cheese were amazing! Sold!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic for a casual dinner with a friend or two. Our server was so friendly and super knowledgeable about the menu. I love that their menu is small - we always think we want more choices, but most often that's not really the case (think about the last time you had to look at a Cheesecake Factory Menu! Ugh! Wayyyy too many choices!!)

I got the half bird with a side of mac 'n cheese. Mac 'n Cheese tasted homemade. Rotisserie chicken was cooked to perfection. Added a lemon garlic sauce that was to die for.

My friend got one of the pizzas and said it was perfection. We also both split the number one listed dessert - so yummy!

Fox Concepts never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in today. We shared a Margherita pizza and prime rib sandwich. Pizza was super thin and could have been a little crispier on the bottom. It was just ok. The sandwich was good. Our server was polite and kept us taken care of. The overall look and feel was open and airy. A little loud for my taste. Maybe carpet or ?  To keep the echoes down. A bit pricey for just ok food."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place.  I came for lunch with 3 other ladies and shared two pizzas and two vegetable sides (the Brussels sprouts were amazing and the broccoli/asparagus was fresh but needed some salt and pepper). The pizzas were delicious as was the ros√©. Service was spot on and the decor and ambiance is beautiful! Super clean, sophisticated yet family friendly. Five stars for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Great place with a great atmosphere! Loved the pizza and the potato wedges. Only downside is that I was eating my pizza too fast and I bit my tongue and now it hurts. Oh well, it was worth it!"}
{"text":"We had the 1/2 bird rotisserie chicken and it was good. The stuffing was great with gravy. The sprouts were not seasoned just smoked and I did not care for them. My glass of wine was good but not $20 good. I am not a fan sorry"}
{"text":"Absolutely enjoyed my first visit.... 
Signature cocktails all looked amazing; I tried the Local and it packed a punch! A fresh and crisp beverage. We tried the hummus to start and couldn't get over how smooth and silky it was (I usually skip Hummus because it's gritty) The cauliflower mash was tasty and creamy. Also went for the  Margharita pizza; the burata was creamy and yummy, sauce on the pizza is a simple tomato, and the crust, 'The Dough' was some of the best I've had of late. The Rotisserie or 'The Bird' is just as it should be, well seasoned, moist and falling off the bone. We didn't try the prime rib but plan to soon!! Our service was stellar. We can't wait to go back. Enjoy!! It's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Another nice-looking Pizzeria that was a disappointment beautiful inside very hip update but the pizza was mediocre it wasn't bad it just was okay had the wild mushroom pie maybe it was a cheese that was too feet tasting not very many mushrooms to oily Maybe I don't know I will go back to try it the crust was decent that's probably the only reason I will go try it again the rotisserie chicken I rather go to Fry's why would you bring me cold chicken not good skinless slimy no good my server was good you know what was going on pretty quick to the table so he made it better may give another try not sure"}
{"text":"I called 20 min ago and they transferred me to the bar for takeout. I was on hold for 5 min and no one picked up. I hung up, called back and the girl on the phone said please wait so I can grab someone. After another 10 min on the phone I hung up again and called back. This time I told the girl I've been waiting 15 min to place an order and she laughed at me. I said \"this isnt funny, how hard is it to tale my pickup order?\" She said please hold while I transfer you to the bar and thats when I hung up. 

They've been open long enough to train and retrain staff on how to handle a takeout order. The way I was treated is absurd and I bet you'll have the same experience if you try. Fox and the fam need to get a reality check on customer service."}
{"text":"Very Unimpressed with this place.Went last night , Tuesday 9/26. First time there.
We did have a reservation and we were sat right away.
I guess the problem to me is this. The place looks like a diner, Denny's like, a little nicer ;)
Girls at the front desk, nice enough, but lack hospitality experience.
Cocktail so weak, I couldn't taste any liquor. I did ask server about it and was brought then , a crazy strong one. Which is better than not 
Server seemed medicated possibly? No personality whatsoever. Could barely hear her speak.
Food, the most important part ...right? Mediocre at best.
I had Pastrami Sandwich, not much pastrami there, a lot of cheese....pretty much tasteless.
My husband  had pizza, it was good, but then it was GF so, not much you can expect there, not the restaurants fault.
My one star review really comes form the standpoint , that this place is just another \"concept\" corporate kind of place. 
Mediocre everything, that we as consumers , I guess have become accustomed to.
Myself, I can come up with many other places to go , regardless the price, that are privately owned, much better vibes, better cocktails, better food , and better service."}
{"text":"Visiting from Cali and this place has some awesome excellent pizza. Had multiple choices and I had 3 different types; Very delicious and you won't get disappointed. Macaroni & Corn sides well tasty. IPA were on point as well. You will definitely get your monies worth here. They need to bring one to Cali."}
{"text":"Our first trip to Dough Bird. Cool vibe. Nice big bar that looks fun for drinking and dining. Our waiter Armand made us feel welcome and took great care of our party. Everything was delicious. Outstanding heirloom tomato and artichoke pizza was gobbled up. There was plenty of whole chicken for my wife and I to leave stuffed and too full for desert. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Deliciously fresh ingredients, wonderful selections of chickeny items, traditional & modern pizzas, fantastic sides & house made lemonade.... excellent service, excellent food, ... on the pricey side, but that is the trend here in Phoenix so I don't take off points for that as long as the food is excellent... the only reason for the 4 star instead of 5 star is the NOISE!  We were there for lunch, the place was packed, and my friend and i could not hear each other to have a conversation in a booth.  It looked like a false ceiling over the bar area... maybe extend that out into the dining area?  I don't know how to mitigate the noise level, but I won't be back unless I'm dining alone since you can't have a conversation anyway!  Otherwise, the place is great... they do have tables outside, but since it was 110 degrees outside, sitting outside is not an option for a few months!"}
{"text":"We came here with the family and fox did it again. Never disappointed in any of his restaurants. The kids all got little pepperoni pizzas and they loved them. The wife and I both got a half bird and it was juicy and cooked to perfection. I also added a side of the chipotle bbq sauce for dipping and that was hands down one of the best bbq sauces i have triedWe loved the decor and the place was kept spotless including the bathrooms. Another Home run for fox."}
{"text":"The pizza with bacon, sweet potato and brussel sprouts topped with pistachio was a unique combination of savory and crunchy. The Caesar salad was the bomb, garlicy with just the right amount of anchovy.  The halibut was prepared perfectly..The bourbon and bells cocktail was perfectly balanced with just the right amount of spicy pepper flavor.  A home run with this newest addition to the Fox family!!"}
{"text":"Best over priced rotisserie chicken I even bought! Delicious sauces to dip ( extra cost) 
Great pepperoni pizza. This is my special occasion or just got paid kind of reward! Two people with tip a bit over 42.00. 
But delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here with my dad for an early lunch when I was back in town. We were some of the first people in the restaurant at 11:30am on a Saturday but by the time we left there was a wait for a table. We both ordered drinks; my dad a Kilt Lifter (in a can) and I ordered The Local. Top marks for my drink - I'm not a vodka person but the drink was extremely fresh and not too bitter. We split the Crispy Pastrami pizza and the Prime Rib Dip. They were both fantastic! Our waiter also recommended the Jamaican Jerk Marmalade which complemented the pizza (and the fries, mmm) well.

The whole vibe here is exactly what I expect when I go to an FRC (and having just moved from Scottsdale I believe I've been to most of them): quality, trendy, delicious. Keep it up - and keep 'em coming to Irvine!"}
{"text":"I had resisted dough Bird because I thought their prices were on the high side. A friend wanted to meet there for dinner so I gave in.  I had a garden chopped salad...indistinguishable from their other salads. The portion was small and the added chicken was meager and some of it inedible: $15.00 and no bread.  compare that to what you get at Wildflower for $5.00 less with a bigger portion and quality bread.  With a glass of passable wine (not that generous) my bill was $25.00 leaving me hungry and disappointed.  As other's have pointed out it's expensive for what you get. Poor value for money spent. Pretty place though."}
{"text":"Came today for a late lunch with my family. Place was busy but thankfully,we had reservations. Our server was great with suggestions since it was the first time we've been here. Husband and son chose a pizza. Hubby had the pastrami pizza and my son had the pepperoni pizza. They both really enjoyed it. My daughter had the BBQ chicken sandwich with a side of mac n cheese. She is very picky with food and she was extremely pleased with her choice. I chose the 1/2 chicken with the lemon & garlic dipping sauce and the asparagus/broccolini side. Chicken was perfect and the dipping sauce was excellent.  It was probably the best chicken I've had in a long time. The broccolini/asparagus was cooked perfect. Finally we split The Elvis for dessert and it was delicious. I definitely would recommend Dough Bird. We had such a wonderful experience today!"}
{"text":"Been there several times since they've opened. Yes it is a typical Fox restaurant the shashito peppers are amazing I don't really get much else except the pepperoni pizza with Barada I just wish I knew how to spell Barata.

The section of the parking isn't huge and it's a little cramped however it's an amazingly large strip mall parking lot... If you have to walk 50 yards I believe that may be worth it. I had the prime rib the hummus the salads and the desserts and I have yet to find any issue wrong with any of it."}
{"text":"The service was great, the atmosphere was typical Sam Fox but I'm still trying to figure out why I spent $14 for a sandwich with mostly dark meat chicken. If I would've known that their chicken was a mix of both white and dark meat, I would have gotten the pastrami instead. Blah. 

But, the coleslaw and Mac n cheese were good. I just don't know if we'd drive to Arcadia for mediocre casual dining. (And let me stress CASUAL)."}
{"text":"The food here was great! The service was attentive and the decor was to die for! Such a fun trendy place to go for lunch! The pricing was appropriate for the quality of food we received and the servers seemed happy to be there. They had plenty of vegetarian options! And the location in Arcadia is wonderful! I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Clifford was GREAT! Ask for him! First time going for my friend Alexis and I absolutely loved it! I had a half chicken all dark meat! Absolutely amazing! Chicken cooked perfectly! Totally recommend! 5 stars hands down!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dining experience at Doughbird.  The waitstaff were attentive and friendly, service was fast, and the food was tasty.  My friend and I split the brussel sprouts pizza.  In addition to the brussels, this pizza also comes with sweet potatoes and bacon on it.  We asked for the bacon on the side since I don't eat meat and this was easily accommodated.  I thought the crust had a nice flavor and was soft without being too \"doughy.\"  Very delicious.  I'm not a fan of the Fox restaurants in general, but they did seem to get it right with this place.  Even their website is normal and not the usual over-the-top and trying way too hard marketing nonsense.  If you are looking for a good pizza, that has some unique topping choices/combinations, try this place out."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic dinner tonight; I started the night off w a margarita that had a three tequila blend and a honey syrup of some sort and tuxedo salt.  It was sooo good.  Our server was fantastic, one of the best I've had in a very long time!  He was very knowledgeable of the menu and frequently offered to match cocktail/drink pairings w the food we ordered.  It worked; we also tried a beer (grapefruit lager, I believe) and it was good too!  For dinner we each had the prime rib dip (the menu looked so good but I had been dreaming about this prime rib dip all day).  Had it w fries, thought it was all great.  Loved the au jus, though my friend was disappointed to hear that enough to take home w her leftovers would cost another dollar  I ordered a pizza to take home and opted for the Brussels sprout pizza.  I snuck a piece and it was sooooo good!!!  The bacon on top was seriously some of the best I've had!!!  Check out the pic.  And we also ordered the butterscotch cake to share for dessert.  It was pretty good too, though I thought the cake a bit dry.  Butterscotch was great.  

More than anything, I would return for the Excellent server!!  I was so bummed to hear tonight would be his last night.  He was attentive, knowledgeable, and really worked hard to value the product.  He even gave me a birthday candle w my cake!! 

Definitely recommend a visit; parking is tough.  Left turns are a challenge w the lights."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service was average. Prices are high for what it is...in my opinion. Honestly, probably won't be back since there are plenty of other places with good food, great service, and better prices."}
{"text":"We had such a great time here. And our server was incredible, so helpful and fun. The food was on point, I had the chop salad with chicken -- amazing, highly recommend it, though next time I'll get the dressing on the side because it was rather drenched."}
{"text":"I am feeling like it was just us that had an unpleasant experience reading all of the positive reviews. I have also dined at other fox restaurants including blanco tacos, culinary dropout, Zin Burger, north and flower child with all positive experiences. 

We ordered the three cheese Stromboli as an appetizer that we never received. The meals came out and we asked about the Stromboli and the waiter said it was being fired? We asked for it to be taken off the check since we had already gotten the meals. I ordered the prime rib sandwich. It was the thinnest prime rib slices I have ever seen on this very thin bread that was more like thin pita and it was $17. My fianc√© ordered the rotisserie chicken thinking that it was the signature dish. It was tasteless and even with the jalape√±o pesto it just was dry and gross. 

Other people around us seemed to be happy with their orders so maybe we just got unlucky but because it is 35 minutes from our house and there are 50,000 other Phoenix restaurants we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Yes - you can ruin a margarita pizza but these guys nailed it! Crispy, thin, salty, and cheesy. The sauce was deep and delicious. Good cocktails and all the other food out of the kitchen looked amazing. I sat at the bar and had awesome service. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful spot for dinner. We were sat immediately and served by the wonderful Hunter. He made sure our drinks were full and our mouths were fed! I enjoyed the Margarita pizza and a side of Mac n cheese. I would highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Another fox restaurant? 

This one might surprise you. Please note if you order any sandwich here it will not be what you might be expecting. However give it a chance. What a pleasant surprise especially for a fox concept. They went out on a limb and it pays off. This goes for the salads as well. 
Pizza was good and has buratta cheese on top. 
This place does gets busy so be prepared or eat at the bar. 
I will return to explore some more."}
{"text":"Pizza was very good. Flavor was lacking a bit in the chicken and sides. The dipping sauces were a little disappointing. The drinks were outstanding as was the service. Would probably return for only the pizza next time."}
{"text":"Party of 7 on a busy day but we're seated within 20 minutes. Service was timely and attentive. Food delicious. Roasted chicken was perfect"}
{"text":"I liked the decor and location, but I found the food to be very mediocre.  

We had a large party, and nobody really liked the food despite getting a wide variety.  The prices were a bit on the high side for what you actually got.

Also, I found the service and people working there to really be a cut below what you should expect."}
{"text":"For years I've watched this space go from dingy apartment complex and gas station to gorgeous plaza. I've waited with anticipation for months for this chicken and pizza Fox outfit and I finally got to try it last night. My wife and I shared a half chicken with Chipotle BBQ and Teriyaki Pineapple dipping sauces with Caesar salad, potato wedges and a pepperoni burrata pizza. All of it was top notch delicious. 

When we put our name in, they told us it would be an hour wait so we walked a block down the street to The Little Woody to play skeeball while we waited. Twenty minutes later our table was ready, so don't fret if your estimated wait time feels \"too long\".

Cant wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"We ate here today for the first time. The interior is very attractive, light & airy. Our initial server was friendly and helpful. Turns out he didn't have our table, it was another server's. When the other server finally appeared, we ordered a pizza. We wanted 1/2  margherita and 1/2 barbecued chicken. Waiter announced they do not allow people to split orders for pizzas. He said the kitchen staff refused to do splits. So we ordered the margherita.  Imagine our surprise when the pizza ordered by the people seated next to us arrived. Half pepperoni and half margherita. I asked them if their server said they could not place an order like that. They said no, no problem at all. I then asked our server when he reappeared why they could split a pizza and we couldn't. He at first was going to deny that happened, but then he saw their pizza.  He then responded \"They're special\".  Oh, ok. The initial server came by and we let him know what happened. He asked the manager to stop by. The manager was very nice, listened to us and said that should never have happened. Some specialty pizzas cannot be split but what we wanted to do was no problem. He removed the cost of the pizza from the bill, which we appreciated, as we didn't ask for that.  He was very professional.  The pizza was good, very flavorful.  But the server's attitude was not good. Really soured us a bit on the experience. Just goes to show that the public faces of the restaurant are as important as those behind the scene. 
 We went to No Que No on Scottsdale Rd. thereafter and had caramel filled churros that helped assuage our feelings."}
{"text":"Boy was this place crowded. Grabbed the last 2 spots at the bar and it was on. Took them a while to take the orders, both drinks and meal. The service was nice but not engaging. Specials were not volunteered or advertised visually before being asked what we want. I like to know what's available in order to make a decision. Shared a chicken Caesar salad, cauliflower mash, and potato wedges. The potatoes were not warm, the cauliflower was bland and the salad was a good Caesar with some rotisserie chicken added. All in all so unremarkable with the flavors. A beautifully trussed open ceiling acts as an amplifier for all the noises in the room. Not pleasant when crowded. I'll likely try again, but not for a while."}
{"text":"Amazing! We tried the two salads, Ceasar with chicken and apple with goat cheese; both were great. We also had the shishito peppers and Stromboli for apps both of which were amazing, the umami sauce was insane. I had the pastrami pizza, a buddy had the bacon and truffled egg, I finished mine, this place is doing pizza right. My other friend had the rotisserie chicken and said he loved it. Our server was great and drinks were good. No pictures this time but I'll be back for sure, I highly recommend coming here they are sure to not disappoint."}
{"text":"Being from Philadelphia, the reviews on Yelp and the interior motif of this place gave us a Steven Starr kind of vibe. The food itself didn't give off a Steven Starr vibe, however it was exceptionally good for the area.

Don't get me wrong, the pizza was awesome! We had the pastrami & kale pizza which really delighted our tastebuds. The bread was thin, but not too thin as to fall apart and feel like you're depriving yourself on some sort of restrictive diet-- it was just thin enough to not overwhelm the flavors of the pie with the presence of the bread. Unique combinations of flavors, nothing too daring, but still well thought out pairings that are absolutely not found at your average pizza joint.

The rotisserie chicken we ordered was juicy albeit bland, even though it was all dark meat. For a place that advertises itself as \"pizzeria and rotisserie\", we did expect the chicken to knock our socks off and it didn't really impress. The side sauces we ordered were buffalo and jalape√±o pesto-- definitely recommend these both. The pesto was so different in the best way possible. 

The macaroni and cheese side was to die for, but I am also a complete sucker for any mac and cheese dish anywhere and will always order without question. I'd like to consider myself a mac & cheese aficionado in that respect. And the mac & cheese here was ON.
Oh we also had shishito peppers as an appetizer and they were good (especially dipped in the sauce they came with) but they tasted like the ones we pan sear at home in canola oil and salt, so they weren't uncharted territory so to speak.

The beer selection was limited, but the IPA my SO ordered did not disappoint. The gin & tonic I ordered was done extremely well and they did not skimp on the gin. Respect.

Last and far from least (actually it was the BEST part of our meal) was dessert: The Elvis. Just order it. Do it. We were so full before we ordered it, but it sounded too good not to order and we devoured it in less than 2 minutes and everything was just kind of a blur and I think maybe we blacked out because when it was gone we looked at each other like \"where did the dessert go?\" So yeah. Order that or deprive your sweet (and peanut butter-loving) tooth. 

So in final: pizza worth experiencing, underwhelming chicken, good cocktails, great service.

We will for sure be returning here to see what other unique dishes they have to offer and we're looking forward to it. Can't wait to write another review for Doughbird!"}
{"text":"Was so excited for this fox concept restaurant to open, have been super happy with the ones they already have! Got here and had a wait, understandably so, when we were seated there were 5 of us, we were brought water, and I had asked for a Diet Coke and one of my girls a Dr Pepper. That took 15 minutes, ok well we were still looking over the very odd menu... our server started out very high energy but used the phrase, fur sure fur sure, about 10 times per visit. Lol finally he gets our food order in 45 minutes later, and mind you we are a larger table and by now people are leaving, but he's babysitting a two top which is great, but we had been out of drinks for 20 minutes and our food still hadn't come. Some other really nice server ended up refilling our drinks and dropping off our food. Now it's been an hour. Food not so good. I ordered a Brussels sprout pizza and it was like the rejected lettuce pieces that you throw away before you cook them, and everyone else's food wasn't that great, let's just say we had leftovers for days but didn't even bother getting to go boxes. Our waiter checked on us never, but the gentleman who dropped off our food did. We are really big into tipping and the tab was quiet hefty so had the server been more attentive, and checked on our food and kept our waters at least filled up he would have had a great night with us! My husband tipped minimum 20% and gave the waiter who actually helped us a cash tip as well! We appreciate good service wherever we go and the service and food was no good for us here. It's so close to our house too! So 2.5 hours and some pizzas later we hit a fro yo place that was open still! Lol"}
{"text":"After learning that one of our other favorite spots in Arcadia totally switched up their restaurant style [talkin' about you, LGO], we had to search for a nearby place for a late lunch, then we remembered driving past Dough Bird and we figured we stop by, I am so glad we did!

When the weather is more enjoyable, they have a cute & cozy patio with misters, looking forward to going back in the fall when it's not melting hot outside! 

The service was really good, or waiter was really nice, asked if it was our first time and so he took the time to walk us through the menu and point out some of his recommendations. 

We ordered the Aviator, Half Bird with Mac and Cheese and Lemon Garlic sauce. I ordered the Afternoon Tea cocktail - very refreshing! Almost dangerously refreshing!

Our drinks came out really quick. But the food took a lot longer. It was almost to the point when I was going to say something because our waiter hadn't been back to check on us and we didn't order any apps so it was starting to linger too long. But just then a manager stopped by to let us know that they accidentally burnt the pizza, she said that they didn't want serve us an overcooked pizza and asked if we'd be okay with waiting another 5 mins and they'll bring it all out at once. We were fine with that and appreciated that they stopped by, only wish they had stopped by a little sooner, our tummies were growling. 

When the food arrived, it smelled and looked great! The mac and cheese is as classic as it can get, which is great! The chicken was juicy and tender, the lemon & garlic sauce was very zesty, but I really enjoyed it. But I will say the pizza was wanting. It had a bit of a soggy bottom. I think they over-compensated for the burnt pizza and this one came out a bit undercooked. But we were hungry so we enjoyed it. 

I'll def be back and bring some more friends. Overall it was a really good experience!"}
{"text":"Sooooo good!!! Fun vibe and great food. The Elvis is heaven. I usually order the salmon for dinner, always delicious!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Ordered the prime rib sandwich and it was horrible.  For 17.00 you would expect it to be pretty amazing. The steak was fatty and over cooked. The pizza was just okay. The Mac and cheese was too salty. Never again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Period. End of discussion !!!!!
Got the wild mushroom pizza and the pepperoni pizza. Also got shoshito peppers. Everything was spot on!!! Only negatives - the long wait AND that they don't do take out. The food is worth the wait. Outstanding"}
{"text":"Really enjoy the food and drinks here.  It is also kid friendly so a spot we can go for a date or as a family"}
{"text":"Phoenix is a great pizza town (fight me), and I wasn't sure if Doughbird would have anything to offer in a saturated market. FRC gets it right yet again. The restaurant produces some crave-worthy pizzas plus many other dishes.

On my first visit, our party of four split a couple pizzas, the cauliflower and a couple desserts. The pizza was delicious, and we loved dipping the yummy crust in the lemon garlic sauce. Please make that your first choice if you're unsure about which sauce to choose. The cauliflower was pretty good, but I prefer smaller pieces that can boast more charred surface area rather than the larger slices they serve.

I came another time with my sister, and she got the seasonal Thanksgiving plate. She loved every bite and returned with one of her friends the next week.

During our most recent visit with fellow pizza loving friends, we got the cauliflower with mac and cheese on the side with jalapeno pesto. The mac and cheese needed the extra oomph from the pesto, and it was another great dipping sauce for the crust. My husband and friends all agreed the chicken was very tasty.

Wino tip- get the Day zinfandel on their wine list. It's a little pricey due to regular restaurant markup, but it's going to be so much better than the supermarket bottles that sell for $30 but retail for $10."}
{"text":"Love the brussel sprout pizza! It's amazing! Also, our server Hunter did such a great job serving us tonight for our friends birthday dinner. Definitely above and beyond excellent service and food!"}
{"text":"We finally had a chance to stop by Doughbird last night (Monday) for dinner, after hearing much buzz around town. We love all of the other Fox Restaurants, so we had high hopes for this one - and they didn't disappoint! 

*First bonus - They take reservations.
*Second bonus - We had no trouble finding parking at all. We didn't even need valet. Perhaps it's different on a Saturday, but I would recommend trying to go mid-week, if you can! 
*Third bonus (most important to me) - They were wonderful with my food allergies. I called ahead of time AND spoke with the waiter when we first arrived, and I had no trouble finding gluten-free and dairy-free options, outside of just gluten-free pizza.

I ordered the wood-fired \"Rocky Free Range Rotisserie Chicken\" and got to choose a sauce and a side. The waiter was really helpful in finding a side that was gluten-free and dairy-free, and made sure to double check with the kitchen if he didn't know. I ordered the \"Jamaican Jerk Marmalade\" and the \"Crispy Potato Wedges.\" The chicken was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was a great accompaniment! The only think I would recommend is perhaps they bake/fry the potatoes a little longer, as they weren't crispy.

Nonetheless, the meal was delicious! My dining partner ordered the Bacon and Truffled Eggs Pizza and ate the whole thing - it was THAT good! 

Final word? Food was awesome, atmosphere was on point, and the staff was super friendly and accommodating. I would definitely recommend Doughbird to all of my #glutenfree friends and acquaintances in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. I know it can be far for those who live in Scottsdale, but it's worth getting outside of your bubble for establishments like Doughbird.

Gluten-free, dairy-free friendly restaurant that offers us more than 1 option for dinner? YES please!"}
{"text":"Eh not the best of the Fox restaurants - the chicken is just fine the pizza choices are odd but the prime rib was great"}
{"text":"Overpriced and loud but good food and good service. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah because yelp makes me type more."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I'm still obsessed! 
We went for my fianc√©s birthday for a party of 16. 
First, they were able to take such a large reservation without hesitation. Next, they even added people to our reservation last minute when our parents invited more people. The table was even ready early so when we go there it was all set. 
The food was amazing as usual!
But the service is honestly the best I've had, and I've worked in the restaurant business before. 
I can't remember the servers names, but you both were great! 

Thanks doughbird for making the experience amazing!"}
{"text":"Very solid place. They do chicken and pizza extraordinarily well (which would make sense). The crispy pastrami pizza is a must try. It sounds odd but its something you have to try. Service has been great. We have sat at the bar before where you can watch the kitchen and it seems like there is serious quality control going on, and you can definitely tell in the food!"}
{"text":"Honestly this place gets 5 stars from me because of the hummus. It's honestly fantastic and the best hummus I've ever had. But I digress..

We tried Doughbird shortly after it opened and we were very impressed! We were curious as to how much we would like it as the concept of Pizza and Chicken was a bit weird to us. We decided to go as a date night and ordered hummus, pizza, chicken, and a bottle of wine. The hummus, as stated above, blew my mind and was fantastic. The pizza was really good and well cooked with toppings well distributed. The chicken was good but what really makes it are the sides (omg, the brussel sprouts) and the many dipping sauces you can choose from. The wine selection was also good and affordable. Loved the open kitchen concept and I appreciate that this restaurant was built in the \"Arcadia\" style as well. We've gone back multiple times since!"}
{"text":"Went here on a business meeting. Now ever time we go out we come back here. I had the prime rib with the sour cream/horse radish sauce and all I can say was it was incredible. I need to try their pizzas and chicken however it's hard to eat anything besides the prime rib."}
{"text":"I knew this place was always busy but I don't normally seek rotisserie chicken when I want to go out to eat. I was in the area and hungry so my friend and I decided to give it a try. The decor is nice, it is bright and has plenty of room. I wasn't sure we would get a seat, as it was of course busy. We walked in and were promptly greeted and asked if we had a reservation, uh oh, no we don't, but that was ok, the hostess found us a nice booth, YAY. We were quickly greeted by our waitress and offered a beverage. She asked if we had dined there before to which we replied no, she then began explaining the menu and answered our questions. We decided to share a salad and a pizza. Normally salads are just that, a salad and nothing to write home about, but not this salad. The rotisserie chicken was moist and flavorful, fresh avocado, the tomatoes were delicious. The pizza had sausage and pepperoni and was big enough for us to share. The sausage and pepperoni were spicy, which was ok but unexpected. The greatest part of the pizza is that dough. It was delicious and addicting."}
{"text":"The name says it all, cause you better have doe that you don't mind flying away.  Start with the + side.  The food was tasty and they carry one of my fave beers on tap, local San tans moon  juice.  Now the reason they get 3 .  I have had many wings in my day, some great and some not worth even mentioning, I've never had $12 wings and then be charged $1 for each dipping sauce (I got 3 cause the wings were naked), in fact McDonalds is the only place I've ever been charged for dipping sauce, they should make that known because I got 2 sauces that came with it, I didn't even eat.  I will chalk that up to the service and a lost star, there were other issues with the service as well, like it took them about 15mins to ask if we were thirsty, and when we got our pizza it was not made how we ordered it.  The food was a bit salty as well, not salty to were it tasted funny, salty as in when we left I needed to drink about a gallon of water so I didn't shrivel up, the additional star lost.  This place seems kid friendly although it wasn't busy so keep that in mind!  Pretty modern but the decor is also cliche, I live in the east valley and drove about 30mins to check this place out, I will not be doing that again, but I may give them a second chance if I'm on that side of town.  And remember this place is a bit pricey so be prepared to spend that bird doe!"}
{"text":"We've been watching and waiting for this place open. It did not disappoint. Sam Fox did it again. The chicken was delicious. The sauces were creative and so yummy.... Especially the umami sauce and the Jamaican jerk marmalade. The pizzas were also very interesting and delicious. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The service was stellar. We only ordered the aviator pizza. It was so greasy that we had to ask for bar napkins to blot it. For a new restaurant specializing in pizza I would have rather had Dominos. It was tasteless. Possibly the worse I've ever had."}
{"text":"We are devoted fans of FRC restaurants,  so my family expected and wanted to Love Doughbird!  As typical for Fox restaurants the space is beautiful,  bright and cheery.  The service was wonderful,  all staff were professional and friendly = 2 Stars.  Sadly, the meals we ate during our 1st visit missed the mark.  My husband was looking forward to their prime rib sandwich.  He was disappointed that it came out very dry, while relatively plentiful,  the meat was overcooked,  laced with fat and gristle.   I had the barbecue chicken pizza.  The pizza looked good,  but it was lukewarm and very very greasy.  The outer crust was good but the inner crust was so soggy it was difficult to eat without using a knife and fork.  The pizza had okay flavor but the whole texture threw me off.  Our daughter had the quarter chicken kids meal.  It came with a very small leg and half thigh with wing attached.  The chicken was good,  she liked the leg portion and the chicken I cut off the thigh.  The wing portion got set aside.  The corn served with the kids meal was alot of broken kernels that resulted in a mush texture she didn't like.  We shared the Elvis parfait and butterscotch cake.  Those were okay,  but not anything we would want to order again.  We may try Doughbird again,  but with so many other options,  it is not likely."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the service was great!  Hunter was our server and he was friendly and a spectacular server!!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, nothing really stood out as being great. Service was incredibly slow. Waited 45 minutes to sit which is expected, but took 15 minutes to put drink order in and another 15-20 to get said drinks. Drinks were good but pricey. Overall just a over over-hyped Fox restaurant that just isn't worth the cost and hassle."}
{"text":"Really excellent pizza. Haven't tried the chicken. Neat concept. It was super busy. Another great Fox restaurant."}
{"text":"Had two different pizzas..very good.  Chicken wings were amazing well flavored.  Cocktails were ok, nothing to write home about.  Granted we attending their first week open.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"First of all, I would like to point out how clever this name is. Soooooo the main two dishes they serve are chicken and pizza. Dough (pizza) and bird (chicken)! Too clever. 

Now for the food. This place has a great menu and the staff is extremely friendly! I ended up getting the half bird rotisserie chicken with the lemon garlic sauce and fries on the side. The chicken was super well done and the sauce was really tasty. I was a little disappointed it only came with one sauce cause all of the sauces sounded so good. The fries were tasty as well. 

They also seem to have a pretty good reward program that offers some free food and deals from time to time. Be sure to sign up with the bill! 

Excited to return!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Apps. Chicken.  Dessert. Everything was awesome. Will go back. If I lived here...it's a once a week visit."}
{"text":"Another great Fox Concept restaurant! Food was delicious and service was good. Interior decor is beautiful at this location. I had the BBQ chicken pizza and it was superb!"}
{"text":"My rating is a 3.5.  The atmosphere and decor of the new Dough Bird are great and we were excited for our first visit.  The food is solid and we look forward to trying more menu items. The cauliflower mash was delicious and the margarita pizza with burrata was simple yet tasty with a yummy well done crust.  Their signature sauces were good, but not as spectacular as I imagined.  The shishito peppers were good, but I prefer the same dish at Windsor.  Here's the slight downside beyond the slight disappointment with the sauces- the price of drinks. 4 draft beers cost us $25 which pricy for mid-day happy hour time.  Overall, the service and food are reasons enough to come back."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place, as it seemed to be quite popular. Pizza was just OK- nothing really spectacular, but nothing to write home about. Salad was meh. Chicken tasted like the inexpensive rotisserie I pick up from Costco when I don't know what else to cook for dinner. We didn't hate it, but we definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Doughbird lived up to my expectations and I was glad that this was our first stop during our visit to Arizona. I've been waiting to try this place and finally we were seated in this beautifully decorated restaurant. The decor is just so inviting.

For starters against my kids wishes I started with the hummus and had to ask for more bread as my kids devoured it. The hummus was delicious and flavorful and the heirloom tomatoes they added complemented the hummus perfectly.

The pizzas we had was the pepperoni and the aviator. Both so yummy. The dough was perfect and crispy and the sauce and ingredients were plentiful. Literally not a piece was left and at this point not a complaint from my boys and trust me they are picky eaters.

Last but not least the chicken and boy as a parent I was grateful that this place has both chicken and pizza. My teenager loved the chicken which was juicy and moist and was being greedy with his brothers and ate most of it himself. And believe me between me and my youngest the Mac and cheese did not stand a chance. We actually ordered more.

Great concept, great service, great food. Until
Next year when we return to Arizona."}
{"text":"Yummy! They make their own homemade gluten free pizza crust! It was super tasty!! Yummm."}
{"text":"Garden chopd salad was so fresh and tasty, never thought to put fresh herbs in my salad - genius!  Pizzas came out piping hot, soft and chewy and so flavorful. Sat outside with the dog, by the fireplace, great great great restaurant. Massive thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here last Sunday.  The service was excellent. The restaurant was clean and bright; very welcoming.  The kind place you walk into and just feel the good energy.  The food was simple and delicious.  

Although we will not be back till after our summer trip, we will be making this a regular stop after!  The bread is so delicious and soft I wouldn't be able to not cheat on my diet ;).  

Service is what makes this place great!  I would come back even if the food wasn't as good."}
{"text":"Doughbird was awesome. We sat at the bar which is what I'd recommend because watching the executive chef quarterback the kitchen was a ton of fun. We had the pepperoni and buratta pizza and half chicken we loved both along with great wine selection. We've multiple times and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood doughbird! I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I saw this place open up, but I was definitely happy with my decision to check it out. 

1. Parking - This place is popular, so carpool with your friends or take a Lyft because parking is sparse. You're going to a cool new hip place, so take some cool new hip transportation while you're at it. 

2. Alcohol - I picked the \"Afternoon Tea\". It had peach sake in it! So delicious and I want to drink it again. If you like sake, you'll like this sweet sake cocktail. 

3. Food - You've probably read the other reviews but OMG the Brussel Sprout pizza. Get it, savor it, and then wonder why you didn't order two. The cheese Stromboli as an appetizer was sooo delicious but I wouldn't recommend if you're also ordering pizza. 

4. Ambience - The interior design in this restaurant took my breath away. All the details from the plates to the seating, to the windows, it's all tasteful and very beautiful to look at while here. 

I want to go back to doughbird with my friends and share a chicken! You should grab some friends and head here soon!"}
{"text":"Our family ordered the rotisserie chicken, pastrami sandwich, roast beef dip sandwich, and a pepperoni pizza. All were very well prepared, presented, and all tasted fantastic.  Enjoyed several craft cocktails as well.  Service was very good and the restaurant is very family friendly.  Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a small celebration of moving into town from Florida. We were excited to try the place because of the reviews. There was a pretty hefty wait when we got there (45-60 minutes). We ended up snatching a quick seat outside though. 

We tried some of our favorites at any restaurant and that started with the Hummus. It's pretty good but only comes with a 6\" piece of pita. If there is more than one person eating the hummus you are going to have to buy more pita bread to use the hummus. 

I got the prime rib dip (Try and say that 5 times fast lol). It was pretty good, not crazy but the fries were ! 

The drink prices were around $6 a beer so I refrained from purchasing any. Wine was about $8 a glass. Both a little steep for the cheapest drinks.

My table mates got the pizza and they said they were delicious. Maybe I will try those out next time and maybe I'll have a higher rating to give, but for now, 3 stars is fitting."}
{"text":"I'm officially obsessed with their hummus, it's the best I've had and the bread that comes with it is freshly made and a perfect pairing with the creamy hummus. Their chicken is consistently good and all of the dipping sauces are amazing, my favorites are the buffalo, jalape√±o pesto and the cucumber feta yogurt. Plus they always have great beer on tap and awesome service!"}
{"text":"Overpriced food although tasty small portions for the price. Service was good except once the foos was served I think they forgot about us."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! The chicken was amazing, especially with the umami sauce. All of the sides were great and so was the pizza! Super yummy stuff and the atmosphere was fun. I will say the drinks weren't great, but that's an easy fix! Wish they'd come to Austin where I live!!"}
{"text":"Good gluten free pizza but would be nice to have more options featuring the chicken. Service was amazing. Everyone was incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"Great pizza and chicken! However, it is so hard for me to order a chicken when  I loooove pizza.......so I ordered it to go and took it for lunch...it was great. I am going to go there and order the chicken to eat there though, but that will be tough for me.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is great, nice and open with modern flare. The staff was very attentive each time we been there. 

We had the Brussels sprouts pizza and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Unfortunate experience tonight. One would think that the server would have noticed when she was delivering a second round of drinks (20 mins after we placed our order) that no appetizer had been delivered, but she didn't. Then, when our entrees arrived  (30 mins after ordering) the wrong sauce came out and the namesake chicken was cold. After inquiring about the correct sauce, and the appetizer, it finally arrived but no real apology, no visit from the manager. In fairness, they did deduct the appetizer from the bill, but I was left less than impressed by my first visit..."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Great space and concept. Required valet and no call-in take out. Food is the same as North--mediocre on a good day! You are paying for the real estate. Empty tables and a 45 minute wait?"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for date night last week and had an INCREDIBLE meal! We live in the neighborhood so were waiting for the newness to wear off a tad {due to long wait times} before giving it a try and i'm so happy that we finally made it in. They also take reservations which is a major plus - I highly recommend doing so, even for a party of 2! They were packed on a Wednesday evening.

To start, we ordered the Heirloom Tomato and Quinoa salad and it was one of my top 5 fav salads ever. I LOVED that it had two dressings - a feta yogurt dressing and a champagne vinaigrette. They went so well together! The salad had sweet heirloom tomatoes, quinoa, olives, pine nuts, and more goodies that were just so tasty. I would get this for a meal with chicken and be the happiest camper. 

For dinner, we split the heirloom tomato {apparently we have a thing for heirloom tomatoes} + artichoke pizza and added fennel sausage to it. It was also extremely delicious. I loved the chewy crust! We also split the half bird with cauliflower mash and the umami sauce, horseradish sauce, and jalapeno pesto. Oh man, 3 sauces may have been overkill but I absolutely loved every one of them. The horseradish sauce is SO good on the cauliflower mash. 

Of course we couldn't leave without dessert! We ordered the Elvis and practically licked the mason jar. I wasn't super fond of the bacon cookies though. That is just a personal preference. 

We will definitely be back. My only complaint is that prices are a bit high. I feel like the pizzas could be reduced by a few bucks to compete with surrounding pizzerias but that is just my two cents! Yet again, Sam Fox knocks it out of the park!"}
{"text":"There's been a lot of talk among my friends about Dough Bird. Expectations are high because Sam Fox is brilliant and his restaurants are amazingly popular.

This one is, I believe, succeeding early based on his reputation. I just wonder if people will come back? There's nothing really wrong about this place.  The food is good but unremarkable. The service is really good. 

Hubby and I arrived at 6:45 on a Saturday with no reservation. The place was hopping and the wait was 40 minutes for a table. They take a cell number to text you when your table is ready, so you could walk around the strip mall, I guess. However, we were very lucky to snag a spot at the bar. A friendly wait person greeted us quickly and brought water, then wine.  I think the option of a carafe of wine is nice rather than buying a whole bottle.

She was back shortly to take our food order -- she hit the right notes of friendly, genuine, and helpful. 

I can't describe the food at this point because it took a l-o-n-g time to be served. However, by sitting at the bar, we had an entertaining and educational view of the staff.  Boy, do these folks work hard. They move with efficiency, smile most of the time, and fill in wherever needed.  Any time there was a lull in orders up (maybe twice over the course of 90 minutes), they were refilling ingredients, restocking plates and stretching out more pizza dough. 

When our dinner finally arrived, it looked good.  We wanted to try both dough and bird so we got the pepperoni and burrata pizza and the half roasted chicken with the umami sauce and mac &a cheese on the side.  The pizza was quite good -- tiny slices of pepperoni scattered across a 6-slice, thin crust pie. Little dabs of creamy burrata and tomato sauce with a just a tiny bit of spice to give it warmth. I liked it but I didn't love it.  There are much better pizzas in town of that's what you crave. The chicken was nicely roasted but the skin was not as crispy as I would have expected.  They do excellent roasted chicken at Chelsea's Kitchen and that's what I expected. The umami sauce was actually a citrusy (Ponzu?) sauce with nice depth. The mac and cheese was so bland they could have forgotten it and it wouldn't have mattered. We had a lot of leftovers and the server happily boxed it up for us. Our bill was $60-something for 2 including wine but no dessert.

One other note -- the restaurant is very noisy. People were having a good time.  If I was with a group where some wanted pizza and others wanted chicken or salad, this would be a good place. But with all the awesome restaurants in town to choose from, I'm not sure I would make a second visit here. You should go and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to try great rotisserie and pizza as I pass by daily. Got 1/2 rotisserie chic. At $17 would expect the best ever- - was on the dry side and small.  The Brussel sprout pizza was just ok according to my friend.  The beautiful chopped garden salad was a bit disappointing.   Any chef knows that you have to  season as you go to elevate the flavors of all foods; I think this step was forgotten. All those beautiful ingredients were crying for that punch.
Nicole, our waiter, was awesome.  She knew the menu inside and out.
The restaurant itself  is clean and sleek.
Been there, done that."}
{"text":"We went specifically for the GF pizza and it did not disappoint! The crust was tender around the outside and slightly crispy bottom. They definitely get an A+. The servo e was really good too our waitress was friendly and attentive. 
We also ordered two sides brussel sprouts and the asparagus/broccolini while very tasting the portion size was soooo small literally 4-5 brussel sprouts and 8-10 two inch pieces of asparagus/broccolini. I'd go back for the pizza!"}
{"text":"Add this to your your must visit restaurants! 
The gluten free pizza was delicious.  The crust was crispy and cooked to perfection. 
The cauliflower mash was very flavorful as well. 
This restaurant was very busy on a Thursday night, so we opted for immediate seating at the bar. We later learned that they do take reservations. 
The bartender; Daniel, provided us with quick and friendly service, despite being very busy making drinks. 
We will definitely be revisiting in the near future."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal here.  We took advantage of the 25% off on July 4th to try a meal here.  At first I was disappointed there was no Chianti on the menu.  We were presented with tastings of two alternatives and I fell in love with Dolcetto d'Alba.  Once settled on our bottle of wine, we went with sharing the Chicken & Avocado salad and an Aviator pizza.  If the chicken on the salad is the same as what they serve from rotisserie, then I absolutely recommend it!  It was delicate, moist, fresh and flavorful.  The Aviator pizza was delicious too!  Well prepared and executed!  What set it apart from other fired pizzas was the crust was a bit soft around the edges.  While a prefer a crispier crust, this wasn't a big issue--just presented another style option of pizza for me.
Next time, I want to try the Pastrami pizza!!"}
{"text":"Cocktails were perfect, recently opened we got lucky and grabbed a spot at the bar.  Otherwise was an hour wait.  Wings, stromboli and pizza we had all were fantastic and great service!"}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch multiple times and it never fails to impress me! The vibe here is great and every server I have had is kind and hospitable! One of the managers named Antonia is my favorite! Definitely always makes our visits worthwhile! The menu is vegan friendly which is a huge bonus! I have had most of the salads there & they are delicious! And the hummus appetizer is a must!!! Ps- my non vegan friends are obsessed with the pizza here! Can't go wrong with anything on the menu here. 100% recommend to anyone looking for a delicious guilt-free meal"}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit to this place. Not a fan and won't be going back. First visit was packed and we were told if we didn't have reservations then we wouldn't be seated that night. To my curiosity I thought this place must be that great! 
Second visit was during the weekday/noonish. We ordered the Cesar salad and BBQ chicken pizza. The salad was ok, not the best I have had. The pizza was over powered by the sauce. You couldn't taste the chicken. 
My Third and last visit I figured I would give them another chance. Since this is an upcoming restaurant and by now they should have all their kinks fixed. I made reservations for a Friday night for 3 people. We arrive 15 mins before our reserved time. We were told to wait for an open table (I could spot 4 empty table) but I waited. This restaurant was not design for customers to wait for an open table. You lean again a wall, as you watch others enjoy their meal and hope one gets up and leaves so you can be seated next. 20 mins pass our reserve time and we finally get seated. We ordered wings, the taste was over powered by a sweetness and sauce. We ordered 2 pizzas, they were meh. 
I give this place a 3 stars because they cook from scratch."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic spot for pizza and chicken. Has a very nice patio, open when weather is good. Service is great. Get the Brussels sprouts and the BBQ chicken pizza with marinara sauce instead of BBQ sauce. I also would not reccomend the mashed potatoes, but the cauliflower mash is superb. It is amazing if you love good pizza and chicken. Definitely recommend dough bird."}
{"text":"Another great Fox concept.  The salads were fresh and tasty.  The pastrami pizza was unique and delish.  We are looking forward to going back and trying the bird.  The service was fast and friendly.  We will take the whole family for the next visit."}
{"text":"Doughbird is part of the Fox Restaurant Concepts and for that my expectations were high. Unfortunately I was disappointed.

Came in for happy hour on Easter Sunday. The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful. It is exactly how I want my home to look like, with the natural sunlight and gorgeous furniture. Wish I could rave the same about the food.

Doughbird specializes in pizza and rotisserie chicken so I opted for the Halfbird with a side of perfect potato puree. The potato puree was delicious and creamy. I thought the chicken was dry. The flavor was good but it was underwhelming. I picked the lemon and roasted garlic sauce on the side and it was okay. My boyfriend ordered the margherita pizza which was on the happy hour menu (4$) and he thought it was undercooked. He also ordered the buffalo chicken wings which we all thought was delicious. 

The drinks were great. I ordered the watermelon daiquiri from the happy hour menu ($7). The servers were attentive and efficient."}
{"text":"Love this place they have the best margarita pizza, their Cezar salad is delicious. I have also tried their bbq chicken pizza and it was great too."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE. Fox just keeps the pace going and I'm so happy about it. I ate here last night and I immediately fell in love with the interior. It was really had a home style feel. Even to sit on the patio would be nice. The lights were dimmed and the staff was really sweet. We had a bottle of the Malbec which was great to set the  mood. We started off with the goat cheese and arugula salad. Super refreshing. We also had the truffle Stromboli, which i mean... you can't go wrong with truffle!!! So SO So good I want about twenty portions of it. Then we had the asian chicken pizza and it was amazing. I would recommend the pizza because they have multiple dipping sauces and our waitress said that they can go with every single pizza. I will for sure be coming back for the chicken because it looked and smelled phenomenal. Will for sure be back!!"}
{"text":"Fresh atmosphere, friendly to our 3 month old (lunch time 1pm on Saturday with no wait) but there's no changing table in the restroom. Food was excellent aside from a mixup with my order which they fixed quickly.  We had the Caesar with chicken, pizza and prime dip. Loved he crispy potatoes, homemade croutons and pink lemonade..the small things add up. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Great food, great service and whether you walk-in or make a reservation, the wait usually isn't bad at all."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed ourselves here! The interior is beautiful and the service (with Jill) was awesome! I love a place where there's too many good things on the menu to confidently decide what I want to eat. My fiance had the rotisserie chicken and I had the Aviator pizza. This is oddly specific, but they use those small pepperonis where the tops get just a little crispy in the most perfect way...it's delicious! Also the butterscotch dessert was amazing."}
{"text":"I really don't think this place is all that special. I think that after the fuss of a grand opening and a long time waiting for the new Sam Fox concept, people were packing in but now it's slowing down. I really wasn't impressed at all.

First off, they take over the parking lot at this little shopping center like they are the big elephant in the room when there are other stores and businesses in the area that need parking space as well. Who needs that! And you can't just pull up and park -- you've got to use the valet! That's a needless hassle right there. 

When we got in, we were two of us, looking for a booth and we got seated out at a little table in the middle of the room. The lighting is bright and honestly, the place reminds me more of a Denny's than anything. It's NOT a date night place. There were tables everywhere with little kids yelling. The place is too lit up and too noisy to be the kind of cool vibe that I was looking for that night. 

I won't comment on the food, because after waiting for service and it didn't come, we got fed up and left. And we won't be back."}
{"text":"I give this a 2 due to the cleanliness of the place, atmosphere and the staff who were nice and efficient.  We split the Apple & Goat Cheese salad for $10.00. Nothing special and a lot of  arugula in the salad not much else.  Did like the fennel in it.  The BBQ pulled chicken was a panini maybe? Just plain gross. We both ate only half of our halves. No BBQ taste, but you could taste the Mayo(?), soggy. Very little chicken. 

No we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Overpriced hipster joint, food is nothing special. \"Service manager\" contacted me via yelp and straight up lied to me in a very bold, strategic manner."}
{"text":"Just when my faith had been lost that Sam Fox could create a restaurant with flavors that live up to the restaurant interior and service level, I have been reborn. If Fox were to start a cult based on Doughbird, I'd be the first to drink the kool-aid. Finally, flavorful dishes have found their ways into Sam's heart and consequently my mouth, multiple times now. I can only pray that soon lord Fox will bless us with some additional locations, preferably one near me so that I can worship daily."}
{"text":"I do like this new Sam Fox concept. While i'm not a huge fan of the cafeteria style layout, the food does make up for it. I ordered the rotisserie cauliflower with the umami sauce and potato wedges. This dish was delicious! My husband ordered the prime rib dip and he found the meat to be quite fatty but still tasty. We will be back to continue checking out additional menu items. Be sure you make your reservations far in advance. This seems to be a hot spot in Arcadia at the moment."}
{"text":"Can someone explain to me what I'm missing about Doughbird? I have read spectacular reviews on this establishment and even had personal friends tell me it's a must have. Is this place run by a cult and brainwashing's on the menu? 
I visited Doughbird with a party of 4 and we ordered almost everything on the menu and we literally were in shock that anyone would return here after their first experience.
First we ordered the $25.00 whole chicken and we all agreed it was not any better then Boston Market for a quarter of the cost. The chicken came with one side which we choose Mac and Cheese (very dry and tasteless) we ordered additional sides as well. The beans were very good and the potatoes were average but enjoyable. 
Second we ordered the BBQ sandwich. Once again, I describe this as mediocre at best. Certainly nothing to go back for. The side accompanying the sandwich was coleslaw. The coleslaw was fabulous. 
Finally we ordered 2 pizzas. Bacon and truffled egg & BBQ Chicken. They were good but nothing to get excited about. Certainly not something you would have to go to Doughbird to get. Unique gourmet pizza joints are popping up on every corner. Even though we were full we still were trying to understand why this place was getting the raves it was so we thought maybe the desserts are the star. So we ordered the warm butterscotch cream cake. And once again we all fell down from the high pedestal of expectations to the boring low spot of nothing special. The dessert was dry and completely unexciting. We truly sat there looking at our hefty bill in confused astonishment. 
In conclusion, most of the time, the reviews on yelp can guide you to some amazing culinary experiences but in regards to the Doughbird, DON'T believe it. SKIP IT!!! You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Another Sam Fox debut & success.   We engorged on the truffle cheese Stromboli, Margherita Pizza  whole bird chicken  which was absolutely amazing.  I had no room for dessert but I will be back 100% thank you!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I, big Fox concept fans, had an event cancelled and stopped by Doughbird on the fly. We had a short wait on a Saturday night. (Exactly as estimated.) The large room is noisy - a little too noisy for us. We had to raise our voices to be heard across the small table. We both wanted to take pizza home so we over-ordered and got to try a few things. NOTE: we only had the gluten-free crust due to a food allergy. The GF pizza crust was very good. We ordered the mushroom pizza which was excellent and the Brussels Sprouts pizza which was okay. We also ordered the caramelized cauliflower with small salads. So... The pizza came before the salads, then the cauliflower, then the salads. Our server, who had been nice and helpful, stopped coming to our table about that time. The Caesar salads were excellent. The pizza - especially for GF - was hot and good. The Brussel sprouts were fairly raw - I expected them to be,  at least, browned a bit. We were never checked with once we got our food, we were never offered a second drink, we had to flag down the hostess for water. We sat for a long time waiting for our plates to be cleared - a long time. The restaurant had emptied by the time we (finally) got our check, but it was still noisy. I would probably go back especially if with a person who had to eat gluten-free. But I wont be rushing back."}
{"text":"Excellent food - chicken with cauliflower really good.. 

Bar BQ chicken salad was solid!!"}
{"text":"I honestly didn't want to eat here because the mashup of a chicken and pizza place seemed weird AF to me.  Actually, it is still crazy to me.  I mean what's next?  A marshmallow and rib place?

All that nonsense aside, I actually really enjoyed this place.  The atmosphere, service, and food were all great.  Especially the food.  It isn't fancy and there aren't an overwhelming number of choices.  Basically just a few unique (but nothing crazy) pizzas, salads, and rotisserie chicken.  I tried something from every category and every item was delicious.  There is not a bad choice on the menu and I hope to return soon."}
{"text":"Went to this place for dinner with my husband. Were seated quickly on the patio. It was inviting and well decorated. We had high expectations given the FRC places we love so much... the Henry, North, True Food and others.  The food was fine but not as good as I had hoped. I had the mushroom pizza and my husband had the French dip sandwich.  Not my favorite FRC restaurant, I think we will go back to our favs."}
{"text":"Went in last night with some good friends of mine who enjoy food as much as I do.
We found the place nice, not too big.
The staff was excited and knowledgeable. The menu was on the smaller side but I like that. Do a few things well, is my motto.
The food came it was plated well and was inviting.
Wings, pastrami sandwich, Dip, and a pizza. We all ordered separately but all sampled each other's.
All of our choices were \"good\" not \"GREAT\".
Teetering on the verge of \"Really Good\" just not making it up over the hump. Fear of too much spice may have been a factor. Our service was \"Great\" meeting the Manager both as we arrived and as we left. 
The experience was nice enough but the food does not give us enough reasons to return.
To be fair, none of us tasted the Chicken."}
{"text":"Another great Fox Restaurant Concepts restaurant...he truly has the magic touch!  We made a reservation on a Thursday evening pretty early and the restaurant was already packed.  The atmosphere was lively, the decor was beautiful (as always), the service was good and the food was tasty.  We shared a bowl of the chicken soup and shared a Brussels Sprouts pizza with sweet potatoes and a Spiral Ham pizza...both delicious and unique!  I will definitely try the rotisserie chicken next time as it looked delicious too."}
{"text":"Shared the Caesar salad & a pepperoni with burrata pizza. Good was very good, but I'd pass on the burrata next time. The cold cheese & unusual texture just wasn't to my liking. Service was good & the restaurant is clean. It is pricey for what you get. Salad $9, pizza $17, 1/2 chicken $17. The pizza would probably be considered a small/medium size."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to coming here since I first heard about its opening.  So I was excited to be dining her with some friends.  The food was excellent.  Lots of great options and everything was filled with delicious flavors.  However I was a bit disappointed with the service that we received.  I made a reservation and when we arrived, we were seated outside.  We were not asked if that was OK, we were just seated there.  It was a bit cold so we asked if they would turn on one of the heaters.  After asking several times, twenty minutes after we were seated, they were finally able to get a heater tuned on for our table."}
{"text":"Yet another Sam Fox gold mine. Not so sure about the concept, but Saturday night there was a decent crowd at 7:00 PM to have pizza and rotisserie chicken. Restaurant is beautiful both architecturally and decoratively-sort of a more formal Flower Child. Hostess was friendly and our party of 4 were seated promptly at our reservation time. 
Our server was full of personality and knew the menu up and down and made several suggestions on how to sample the fare. We ordered 2 pizzas-a pepperoni and sausage and a wild mushroom, and a whole bird with a side of mac & cheese. The pizza was quite good-at first, excellent crust, but then the salt overload hit. I understand the saltiness of the pepperoni & sausage but the mushroom pizza after several bites was too much. On to the rotisserie chicken-$24 with one side-it was just, fine. I wasn't blown away, it wasn't the best I've had, just okay. For $24 keep the cheese-less, tasteless mac and cheese and give me a crave worthy rotisserie chicken! 
We ordered all three desserts-The Elvis-peanut butter, banana, chocolate pudding in a jar, it was okay, the warm butterscotch cake, absolutely delicious and the peach tart, also an incredible winner. 
Return visit? Probably not. Nothing offended or overly impressed me, but for the prices, I was hoping for much more."}
{"text":"Omg my new favorite place for lunch or dinner!!!!! Beyond excited and pleased with the quality of choices on the menu. The Brussels sprouts and kale is delicious. My favorite pizza is the pastrami is to die for. They only have one tv so for those of you who will like sports go somewhere else. Those of you who have woman outings must have. They might have a long wait but definitely worth the wait. Bar seating is fun as you get to watch all the action."}
{"text":"First time will be my last. Space is nice, bright, spacious but loud.  Hubby and I shared Caesar salad, 1/2 a bird with cauliflower mash, lemon garlic sauce,  buttered sweet corn and a carafe of white wine. Our companions shared the Cobb, 1/2 a bird and pepperoni and sausage pizza.  Salads were excellent, birds were ok, nothing special, dipping sauce a bland disappointment. Sides were good. But the noise level made the entire dining experience extremely unpleasant.  Service was prompt, efficient and friendly. Our server was very good and knowledgeable about the menu.  But none of that compensated for the noise."}
{"text":"High priced and mediocre.   The chicken was so so and $24 for a \"whole bird\" it was plenty for two people since neither of us thought it was very good. The sauces were pretty good ... pineapple teriyaki and the jerk. The cole slaw was tiny for $5. The wings were the best part and the sauce was different and tasty. The pizza was so so as well. Overall, will definitely not come back which is too bad since I work right down the street and thought this would be be a good place to grab take out."}
{"text":"I often review based on inspiration, coupled with impression.

After the initial dining experience, I review the pictures that I have taken; and really ponder how I can best convey my dining experience. 

Sometimes, my muse appears and I am inspired to write some epic narrative. And sometimes, I just go with \"meh.\"

This particular Fox Concepts restaurant has me teetering. I can't quite grasp the ultimate point of the various offerings of this restaurant.

I ordered the Rotisserie Chicken with Jamaican Marmalade sauce and Sweet Corn. 

The corn was a hit. It was sweet, juicy and rich in flavor.

The Jamaican Marmalade sauce didn't do it for me. I like my Jamaican sauce to be spicy, as it should be. I like my marmalade sweet and tangy. However, this particular concoction seemed confused and made no lasting impressions on my palate. To top it all off, the chicken was dry. Dry enough to the point that the meat below the skin surface was near flavorless. I am not sure if this simply stayed out too long under some heat lamp. 

But, it just didn't do it for me.

My wife's Aviator Pizza was passable. Although, there are so many more superior options in town compared to this offering. This particular dish was too salty, and the pepperoni was entirely too crispy. Again, it may have been overcooked in the oven. After all, it was a very busy evening.

Overall, it was a good attempt at a mixed concept. But the execution's end result did not quite live up to what we normally expect from this franchise."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the pineapple and ham pizza. The Elvis dessert is freaking amazing. I like to just come here by myself and read the paper and have a nice solo dinner at the bar. There is a really cool aesthetic. 

The best part about this place though is the service. Typical of a Sam Fox restaurant. I never get good service anywhere, and Im not looking for something fussy. Im just looking for some friendly people who are somewhat attentive. This restaurant always has staff that have easy smiles, smart, clean cut, and good natured. Where do you find that these days?

I spoke with the manager Ruben who was super friendly and seemed really professional. I would come here just to avoid the terrible service in other restaurants, but there is so much to like at Doughbird."}
{"text":"Only open a week and the service was flawless!  Love the ambiance. Love the friendly staff, just a welcoming sensation as soon as you approach.

Seated promptly on the shady side of the patio. Good menu offerings. Bummed I had to bypass the interesting cocktail offerings but nobody Drinks Lunch anymore, such a shame!

Pastrami & Gruyere on What?  what IS that awesomeness?  It like a cross between naan and pizza crust and it held up to the moisture from meat/cheese/sauce!  Fabulous!   Coleslaw is a Must Try - napa cabbage so lightweight and crunchy.  Kudos to the Kitchen."}
{"text":"Excellent Service and Excellent food. They were very pleasant and clean. I had the the pepperoni & barrati pizza and it was amazing. Im from NYC and that pizza was next level."}
{"text":"Here we go on my first time here. Amy is the best. Requesting her every time. She was what made our experience right. 

The ambience of this place is actually really nice. I didn't know it was a Fox Concepts but it all makes sense once I heard that. Open kitchen, specialty cocktails and simplistic get great food and overall great time. 

Ordered the Aviator and the Half Bird. Both fantastic choices to get and try for the first time. The aviator was full of meat and tasty. I would order it again for sure. Make sure if you want ranch, ask because they have it and it's homemade like the rest of their sauces. The half bird was full of flavor cooked perfect and was another great choice. 

Definitely left full. Check my pictures for the drinks we ordered and the bourbon and bell was the best out of the 4 we had. 

Amy was really good. She was personal, related to us and just had fun serving us. She was also in a great mood which helps. 

The manager even came by to say hi and check in with us to make sure we had a good experience. We actually had two sauces that maybe with the dishes we got didn't excite us. The umami and pineapple teriyaki sauces were ok. Again this is probably the dishes we had but the ranch topped it all off. We even said it wasn't the great and although it is a $1 a piece they took it off the bill which we didn't ask for. So our experience was to the nines with picking up cues that we didn't demand. 

My only thing that doesn't deserve any negativity for stars is there is no happy hour. Having one would entice me to come more too. Just a thought. 

I will definitely be back and order something new. This place is awesome and so was Amy."}
{"text":"So glad we finally came to try Doughbird! I always love the atmosphere and design of Fox Restaurants, and Doughbird was the same. Such a pretty interior. 

I also love that they have Stella as one of their draft beer choices, and the food is amazing as well. We got the Aviator pizza, and it was so good! My sister and her boyfriend got the rotisserie chicken and Margherita pizza and thought those were great. 

Considering how popular this place is, the wait time really wasn't bad either. I'll definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place and it did not disappoint. Super cute decor excellent service and good food. We had the chicken salad a pizza a half chicken with jerk and BBQ sauce and the cauliflower mash and a dessert. Everything was good except the cauliflower which was just plain and flavorless. We also had 2 specialty cocktails which were delicious. I'll definitely go here again if I'm in that area."}
{"text":"Our 3rd attempt to eat here was a success! Had to make a reservation through Open Table though because it always had a 45+ min wait when we'd try. 
Table of 8, bday dinner with kids and friends. We appreciated the trendy bright decor, open space, and the complimentary valet!
Appetizers were the wings and just simply delicious! Very savory and enough for all the adults to share. :) 
Pulled pork sandwich, the prime rib dip, half rotisserie chicken and pizza for the kids. Kids ate the pizza but weren't fans of the crust - but kids are kids. Tasted yummy to me! 
The coleslaw was more of a salad, guess I'm used to the shredded cabbage. It was good but still too tough? .... not sure if that's the right word though. It's just we know cabbage has a certain after taste and it was pretty prominent. I'll give it another try though.
I wasn't a fan of the pita pocket style of sandwich. The pita bread was bland, the prime rib was okay. I can't say that I'd pay $17 for this plate ever again. It just got too soggy from the coleslaw juice and didn't really grab the Au jus like other style of breads. 
If I may, one thing that is greatly appreciated by many families with small children is to please at least Offer to bring the kids food out first. I couldn't enjoy my salad because many kids (like mine) get too cranky/restless especially if they're hungry and watching the other adults eat. Even our entrees came out before their tiny pizzas. 
I noticed other tables w/children being offered sketch pads too. No one offered our table the option either.
So, most likely won't be back with the kids again. I May go back for a happy hour...TBD..."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is outstanding Sam from Fox concepts out did himself again! Rotisserie chicken and pizza! Great cocktails great desserts great service! I am a huge fan of this place now. Outstanding service truly very well coordinated with everything."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Doughbird and the staff seemed pleasant, bar service prompt food was fresh and good. What bothered me was watching the cooks prepare food with their bare hands and no hair nets or hats while making pizza. I watched them handle cheese, then meat and pick up other utensils all while handling the food. I would give a higher rating, but this bothered me. I will go back again because I always give second chances to newly opened restaurants, but this management being Fox should know better."}
{"text":"The pizza here is incredible. They also have amazing sauces that you can order to go with your meal. I haven't got to try the chicken yet but I am planning on it next time I go. It can get insanely busy so make your reservations well in advance. Very cool place and concept though."}
{"text":"This was my first time at DoughBird, and I was extremely impressed. I've been trying to go here since it first opened, but it was difficult to get a reservation. The restaurant is beautiful and spacious inside, reflecting gray and white tones, and modern decor. I was lucky enough to have a great group of friends to accompany me in the experience. 

To start we ordered a couple of appetizers. I highly recommend the Lebanese hummus; its so delicious, I can't compare it to anything I've ever had before. We also had the buffalo wings and they are also a must!!! They come with a homemade herb ranch that is so tasteful, you'll want the recipe. 
For entrees, we ordered various pizzas: the aviator, the margherita, and the pepperoni/burrata. The pizzas surpassed beyond my expectations. No one complained about any of them. We also ordered the prime rib, which melted in your mouth, and it's nicely paired with great sauces. We sadly didn't order any chicken, but I'm definitely coming back.

Honestly the best part was the service!! My server (whose name I can't remember) was so attentive and kind. He definitely made my experience memorable. Everyone at my party could not stop raving on how great he was. You definitely don't get service like that anywhere. (He was the one with the gold glasses.. super laid back guy.) 

What are you waiting for, go try it for yourself!!"}
{"text":"Another win for the fox restaurants! Was super excited about the opening of Doughbird and was not disappointed when I dropped in. 

I started with a bourbon & bells cocktail made by William, which was sooo good. Don't be thrown off by the bell peppers, give it a try. 

We ordered a half chicken with asparagus and broccolini as our side along with the jalape√±o pesto for the sauce. The chicken was cooked perfectly! So juicy and full of flavor. We also ordered the Bacon & Truffled Eggs. The pizza had scrambled eggs on top and it was AMAZING! 

Waited on by William at the bar and he was very nice and had a lot of good recommendations. I'd try to make a reservation ahead of time, it was packed when we dropped in."}
{"text":"Caesar salad, brussel sprout pizza and an Elvis for dessert. OMG. Great friendly service, Fox Concepts kills it again."}
{"text":"Nope. Nuh uh. Sorry. All of the awesome pizza places in the valley, (Cibo, Bianca, Parlor) this one just doesn't even compare. The pizza was undercooked, sausage truffle pizza had scrambled eggs on it (weird) and zero flavor and pretty sure they forgot the truffle, pepperoni was wayyy too salty. The crust was so bland and had a cardboard texture. Was here with a group and ordered 3 pizzas and a whole bird. The chicken was good, but not at all any better than the rotisserie you can get at Safeway for 5.99. I did like the chili oil on the tables, but to get any out of the bottle, you have to beat the hell out of it. The Stromboli app was actually pretty good and my fave thing we had. Not one person at the table of 7 raved about anything. We all decided it was just \"eh\". Took leftover pizza home to the hubby who ate 2 of the three slices and said he didn't even want the third. Service was great, though."}
{"text":"The concept is simple - great pizza AND chicken under one Sam Fox inspired roof. And, they nail it. 

I've dined at doughbird on several occasions and always leave satisfied with the food and experience. The hummus is very tasty and is quickly devoured if shared. I've enjoyed the Aviator pizza, which is basically a meatlover's, adorned with pepperoni, Italian sausage, and bacon. Alternatively, check out the creative Brussel Sprout pizza with sweet potato, and yes, can't forget the bacon. Each pizza creation is loaded with fresh tasting toppings and enough food to share between two people, while also splitting an appetizer. 

Then, there's the bird. Rotisserie free range chicken that is served halves or wholes. The meat is juicy and tasty, but it wasn't particularly unique. What really stood out was the selection of sauces - I tried the chipotle bbq and pineapple teriyaki. I thought both were terrific. I need to go back and check out the horseradish creme fraiche, maybe even on the prime rib. Ok, now you've got me hungry again!

Finally, both the salads and desserts were surprisingly good. I would pair the delightful chicken and avocado salad with a meatier pizza for a nice balance. Then, finish it off with the \"Elvis.\" It's a delicious blend of peanut butter, chocolate, banana, and yes, again, candied bacon. It's a dessert that will certainly leave you all shook up...

Bottom line: Doughbird is a neat new addition to the Sam Fax restaurant lineup. Great food and ambience. I was not blown away like I've been at some of his other establishments, but Yay, I'm a fan, nonetheless."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong food was amazing and the green tea cocktail was delicious!! However good food is not worth AWFUL customer service from multiple levels. To start the bartender was rarely seen and we were sitting at the bar ...to add to this my friend paid for the bill using her card and I left a cash tip was made very clear to a bar back. Well my friend got her statement and he bartender went out of her way to charge an additional 20 percent tip to the credit charge even though we wrote cash in the tip section of the bill . When my friend called to fix this small problem the manager we talked to was extremely rude saying we were wrong until we got a phone call back ten minutes later admiring their wrong doing. I understand mishaps happen but everyone was very rude when we tried to fix this. 

Update : talked to owner and problem was resolved. A promise was made to speak to staff to ensure this does not happen again. Would recommend to friends food and drinks were tasty and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"This place has delicious pizza, salads and desserts! No wonder they are always so busy! The food is well worth the wait. If you are dining alone or it's just the two of you, try sitting at the bar. You get quicker service and if the food is taking long, then at least you can keep ordering drinks. #lifehack for you right there! The staff is very friendly and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Staff is awesome, design is great, but the menu is very limited if you don't eat bread.  Options are salads and chicken.  I figured the chicken has got to be great since they market themselves as a rotisserie. Nope.  You can get better chicken at the market.  I also shared wings with the table and their wings have a weird flavor almost like sprinkled parmesan and rosemary on them.  I'll stick to a dive sports bar for wings next time."}
{"text":"Very good food we will be back.  Chicken was delicious and cauliflower mashed were too.  Try the shishito peppers you won't be sorry.  Bridget did a ver nice job as our waitress."}
{"text":"Doughbird Restaurant serves mostly Rotisserie Free Range plump Chickens and Organic Pizzas. They also offer appetizers, salads, sandwiches, oven roasted fish, prime ribs and side orders. They offer a full bar and have indoor and outdoor seating. The decor looks similar to the decor our local Ikea Store sells...Looks sort of Farmhouse Swedish with Retro Touches to me.

We started with the Truffle Cheese Stromboli.($12.00 +$1) It had a crusty crisp crust and was stuffed with oozing Truffle laced Italian Cheeses. It was molten yumminess. We added the tomato sauce for $1.00 more but it wasn't needed and took away from the truffle and cheese flavors. Also the sauce was served ice cold. It was like stepping out of a warm bed and jumping into a cold shower....I didn't think it went well together but the Stromboli was delicious on it's own.

We went with the whole chicken because value wise it made sense. (at this time 1/2 was $17 and whole was $24.) Either the 1/2 or whole chicken comes with one side and one sauce so we added an extra sauce ($1. ) and one extra side ($5.)

The Chicken is pretty darn good!.......but mine wasn't served not as warm as it should be.

The chicken is very meaty and moist with just the right seasonings. A whole chicken is a lot of food here and could be enough for four people but you don't get enough sides for four people........

We tried the Jalape√±o pesto and the Spicy Buffalo Sauce....Both sauces were good but the Buffalo was really Delicious and mustardy and maybe apple vinegar. It was just really good!

 Non-Traditional Quinoa Tabbouleh was made with these amazing tasting tomatoes....that were so sweet and fresh tasting. 

The Macaroni and Cheese is good and tasted like macaroni with melted American Cheese to me. Sort of like a childhood Grilled Cheese sandwich.

I got a bunch of my order packed up and I saved room for dessert.

Tried the Butterscotch Cream Cake. It was topped with Vanilla Gelato that was loaded with Vanilla Beans. A cake that reminded me of corn cake sat in a pool of butterscotch. It wasn't too sweet and was just right. It was delicious all together.

At the time of this review this is a newly opened restaurant..for the most part things went well.
 
....Everything I tried was Delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place! I'd never thought I'd say that. Prices are a little higher than expected but definitely worth the price. I got the Margherita pizza and I can't wait to come back and order again. I also want to add their customer service is excellent, they make you feel welcomed and make sure everything is going well! I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"LOVE Doughbird. The truffled egg pizza is a must-try. 

My bf and I went for our 2 year anniversary and the service and food were both exceptional. We'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Holy Mother of Bird! Fox does it again!

Went here with the fam for dinner and was not let down. My wife and I split the chicken avocado salad and heirloom tomato artichoke salad. So tasty. Little bits of chicken in the salad were so juicy! The pizza was really good, but not the best I've had in Phoenix - see Base, Pomo, Barros, or Bianco. Reasonably priced too. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great venue, good value and delicious food! Pizza with pastrami. Wings and a slice of lemon meringue pie"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, fresh quality ingredients. It is a little pricey but you get what you pay for. You leave feeling good, both service and food is on point. You don't feel like a overindulged slob, if your looks for a sloppy pizza joint this isn't your place. Kids meals are perfect size and the salads are beautiful. One of our favorite spots."}
{"text":"Exquisite for pizza place. The parking was a little intense on a Thu night. Strolled in for some food to go. Great space. Friendly staff. I rarely eat pizza but when I do moving forward, I want it to be from here."}
{"text":"Yet another wonderfully executed Fox concept, These people do no wrong. We had a margarita pizza, which is our way of telling if a place is legit. If they can get the basics right, they'll be ok.

We very much enjoyed the vast beer and wine selection. My better half had a half chicken with the lemon garlic sauce and I enjoyed a whole bird with the horseradish creme fraishe and OHMYGOD that sauce was outstanding. I think we'll have to come back and try out the prime rib. 

The desert was delightful and not too sweet, it was a sort of buttered rum cake with a scoop of vanilla gelato, whats not to like. 

We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Another great Fox restaurant.   Great open atmosphere with even better food.   The concept is simple and straight forward.  

The menu features the best Rotisserie Chicken you've ever tasted along with some fantastic wood fired pizzas.  My wife had the White pizza and it was somewhat mind blowing!

There are some nice looking sandwiches on the menu and others have raved about the prime rib but I haven't deviated from getting the Rotisserie Chicken each time as it's that good! 

PS.  Try the umami sauce with your Chicken.   If only they bottled it for consumption at home!   OMG!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was very good an it is easy to eat here on a paleo diet. Love that they use local ingredients and the server was able to answer all of my questions and make the changes I needed. We went for lunch and were seated right away but it still was a long process of over an hour so not good on a lunch break."}
{"text":"Pizza! Pizza! Pizza with freshly rotisserie(d) chicken on top with BBQ and jalape√±o pesto (is your mouth watering yet?). I'm considering eating there again after writing this review. My husband and I shared the BBQ chicken pizza, green chili chicken soup (that bomb in house chicken again), and the side of broccolini. The pizza blew us away, dough was so flavorful and salty. The soup was good and had blasts of different spices. The side of broccolini was eh not the best, lacked a little ummmf. We will be back and we might even go right now! Do yourself a favor and check out this Fox restaurant (Fox concepts never lets me down)."}
{"text":"Pizza is tasty. I tried the pastrami and mushroom. The cicken is dry and would rather get rotisserie from a local grocery store. The french dip is in a pita bread form and is flimsy.  Would only go back for the pizza."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and so was the desert, prices are average however food is not really large portions so I would recommend eat something before"}
{"text":"I had the aviator pizza and the Cesar salad. Both were very delicious. When we went there Saturday afternoon the whole place was packed. Personally that doesn't bother me and honestly it gets me excited to be at such a happening place where everyone wanted to eat. I would definitely recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"This place, like the majority of the Fox Empire is style over substance.  Doughbird is to the restaurant experience what Megan Fox is to acting. A lot of manufactured beauty that garners clicks but not on anyone's shortlist for real accolades.

The interior and design are superb.  FRC really has a top notch aesthetic.  The staff is very professional and we found our waiter to have a great balance of personality and attentiveness.

The rub is the food.  You know when you go to most Fox restaurants that you aren't going to get anything bold or new; everything will be safe within   current dining trends.  That was certainly the case here.  There was nothing special about the chicken, especially when you consider that it is only a tad better then the Costco chicken that is 1/4 the price.  The pizza was fine but there are so many options now in Phoenix that our pies did nothing to stand out from the pack.

All in all it is at the lower end of the Fox spectrum.  It has all of the 'scene' that you'd expect from the group but the food doesn't merit the fuss."}
{"text":"Went for Easter Sunday lunch. We picked a great time and were sat down right away. The ice tea is amazing! They just need more ice on refills! I ordered the prime rib dip. It was so delicious! My daughter (3.5) got the pepperoni pizza she loved it and that says a lot as she is very picky. My parents shared a pizza and salad, they enjoyed both. Can't wait to go back to try the chicken.
Service was great! Wait time for food was just right. Overall very impressed and will be returning again, hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"Got there at 5:30 on a Tuesday night with a reservation and the place hadn't gotten crowded yet. Complimentary valet makes things easy. Loads of staff so plenty of attention.Loved the atmosphere, decor and vibe.Lots of room between tables so neighbors aren't in your lap.

Food arrived quickly and we had ordered a bunch of items to try. Truffle cheese stromboli is listed as an appetizer for good reason. It is tiny, maybe 8\" long and 2\" wide at the most. Heavy on truffle oil not real truffle shavings. It was ok but I wouldn't order again.

Brussel sprouts pizza was a nice size, very thin crust, but not a winner for me. The edges of the brussel sprouts were charred so there was a bitter taste. The glazed bacon topping was a surprising yuck for me but my friend enjoyed it. The sweet potato ingredient made for a pasty mouth feel that I found unappetizing but again, my friend was very happy with the pizza in total.

I have no idea where all these reviews on the rotisserie chicken come up with \"crispy skin\"! We ordered a whole chicken, which arrived in cut portions, easy to handle and divvy up between us. The flavor was good, it was evenly cooked but sincerely it was no different than a $6 rotisserie chicken from Costco. And the skin was exactly what you expect to have happen in a rotisserie -tender flavorful well seasoned but certainly not crispy. For $24, although I enjoyed it I wouldn't order it again.

The caramelized cauliflower was the biggest loser. Caramelized? No. Charred? No. Burned beyond eating was more like it. the top was beautiful but the bottom had each floret clumped in burned blobs that were inedible.

The mac and cheese was good but was made with zero love....just pasta in cheese sauce, no cheesy crust from baking. Just a on-the-stove-top average dish.

The peach pie was dry and lifeless -a definite fail. Our server comped us on this because we were so disappointed.

I would still go again but would try different items. I think a second chance is a good idea."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Doughbird today, everything was top notch!! All the months of watching it being built and waiting to eat there was sooo worth it!! A beautiful place, stellar service, and that rotisserie chicken was the BOMB! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Love the service, food, and overall decor. It's a great spot with some unique dishes. Brussels sprout pizza is super yummy!"}
{"text":"We go to Doughbird regularly and always have a great experience.  Tonight the food delivery was very slow, but the manager went above and beyond to make our time enjoyable.  Thank you to the amazing staff!  We will be back again and again"}
{"text":"Lots of light and good energy!   So many windows!

I got the chicken salad sandwich and kids cheese pizza.  Both were excellent!  Fun place with lots of kids and families."}
{"text":"Nice looking place, but very noisy lunch time! 
Had lunch here twice and both were ok. Got the 1/2 chicken with the asparagus/brokkolini side. The veggies are a little on the oily side. Wish they would have a more healthy option as a side since I am on a diet. The chicken was good."}
{"text":"First let me say I love love love the food and the cocktail menu is amazing.  I have been to this restaurant several times, thought it would be great to take my parents out to for Fathers Day, since they have never been.  Unfortunately, we had a waitress that you could tell didn't want to be at work.  Her attitude was horrible and she was very snippy and didn't talk when she should have.  ex. food was brought out by other servers she came by the table and just glared at us and kept on walking, didn't check to see if we needed anything, didn't see if we got everything just kept it moving.  Also when I asked for a straw for my kids because they ordered hot tea she challenged me by saying it will melt the straw and didn't think I needed one. Yes, ma'am u are right if my children drank piping hot tea it sure would, but they pretty much order the tea and wait for it to get to room temp hence they wanted straws, hence why I asked for them.  For a fathers day lunch and me telling him what a great place it was I felt bad we had such a rude waitress, bad first impression for them.  We both tipped 15% & I left a note that said \"have a blessed day\" because maybe she wasn't having a good one.  But remember to smile and be kind it will get you much further in life."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere! Feels like a house that Joanna Gaines designed. 
Very busy and were told we'd have to wait 30 minutes, but we only actually had to wait about 5. The staff were very attentive and friendly. The food was DELICIOUS. I recommend the BBQ beef pizza. The sides were all delicious. The roast chicken was good. I still prefer the roast chicken from LGO, but this was was good too. Overall, a great experience!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places to eat! The interior is very cute and the food is scrumptious. I can't wait to go back. Great food and service! Will be planning another date night here very soon."}
{"text":"The food just isn't great. Pizzas are unremarkable, you can get chicken just as good at Costco for $5. We tried the bacon truffle pizza, with scrambled eggs on top. It was gross, the  bacon is sweet with truffle scrambled eggs, not tasty. The Margarita pizza was flavorless. Caesar salad tasted too strongly of fish. The wine was so warm, it tasted terrible. The service was very good however and the atmosphere is nice. Doesn't make up for the sad food and $100 tab for two pizzas, half chicken, side salad, and wine."}
{"text":"I am a loyal Fox Restaurant patron and I feel so guilty saying that Doughbird was really forgettable. The service was pretty bad but this is what I've come to expect from this family of restaurants. Overworked servers with mediocre work ethics. It didn't upset me since I knew to expect it. 

We ordered chicken wings and a Brussels sprout pizza to split. Both were eh.

Federal pizza has a to die for Brussels sprout pizza if that's your thing. Go there and have it instead because this one is disappointing. 

The chicken wings were not crispy, greasy and drowning in wing sauce. I've met few wings that I didn't like but these made the list. 

 I will try this place once more but I won't order those same things again. Maybe it needs some time to get on its feet. The ambience is stunningly decorated and it is a lovely place to hang out, as are all of the restaurants in this concept."}
{"text":"We had a great date night! There was a 15 minute wait when we arrived, so we pulled up to the bar and enjoyed watching the assembly and pizza oven behind the counter. Food came out a little slow, but the drinks were perfect the wait staff was top notch and we got to meet some fun neighbors that pulled up next to us. The Brussels sprout pizza was unique, tasty, and recommended. We shared some bites with our fun neighbors, they ordered some rotisserie chicken and that was all about the sauce. The night concluded with singing happy birthday to our waiter and enjoying the caramel cake together."}
{"text":"Yum! Today was my first visit and I was very impressed. Amy was our server and she was great. I ordered the cauliflower. It was delicious! Everyone at my table enjoyed their food as well. The manager, Antonia, even stopped by to check up on us. She was very friendly! We were all very pleased with everything and will definitely be back soon and more often!!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Great food! Reasonable prices! Fox Restaurant Concepts created another winning spot. Love this place! So might you."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good service, and all around trendy. I've been here once, and it was a good experience, but I am not dying to go here again....The food was decent, fairly interesting with all of the sauce options, but overall pretty salty and bland. I have a theory that all of the Fox restaurants are really the same food, just presented differently and tweaked a little bit. Oh, and you need a reservation. We waited about an hour for a party of 3 on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"We went for late dinner and had a nice experience. Great Shishito peppers appetizer. Chicken wings were good. We had a All meats Aviator pizza (good), rotisserie half chicken (little dry, average flavor), grilled cauliflower (first time to eat this and enjoyed very much). Friendly service and nice experience."}
{"text":"The first thing you'll notice about this latest Fox Restaurant Concept facility is how LOUD it is inside.  Like a lot of other Fox RC locations there is no attempt to cushion the ambient noise with any type of acoustical device.  With an open wood ceiling, bare floors, and minimal cushions on the wicker chairs all you can hear is the background din, which quickly becomes uncomfortable.   I would imagine employees who spend a good deal of time here will need a good audiologist in just a few years.  I thought Zinburger in Gilbert and Olive and Ivy in Scottsdale were loud but this place takes first place.

The schtick here is pizza and roasted chicken, an unusual combination, for sure.  My wife had the aviator pizza and I had the 1/2 chicken.  She thought the pizza was OK, but nothing special.  The crust was soft and sloppy, so its not a New York-style pizza where you can pick up a firm-crusted slice, fold it in half length-wise and eat it.  You'll have to eat it Trump-style, with a knife and fork!

My bird was just OK, too.  Again, nothing special.  For $17 you get a breast, wing, leg, and thigh.  For $5 I can get a similar tasting whole ready-to-eat chicken at the grocery store and be just as satisfied.  I could not get excited about this bird.  If you are going to base half your restaurant on roasted chicken, and get nearly $6 a pound for it to boot, it should be memorable.  It was not.  It tasted just like chicken.

The d√©cor is nothing special, providing little in the way of ambience. There is no warm, cozy feeling, at all.  In fact, it replicates the coldness of Zinburger with the high tops and tables and hostess station.  I understand repeating this design model is probably cost effective, but for nearly $50 for lunch this place is no more or less pleasant than a Denny's.

Service was good; our server was certainly attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I had pretty high expectations for Doughbird being a part of the Sam Fox restaurant concepts, but I left the restaurant feeling a little disappointed. First off, the ambiance and decor is great, as are all of the Fox restaurants. In the beginning, I thought the the combination of rotisserie chicken and pizza sounded really strange but I figured that it could somehow work. We started with the Lebanese Hummus which had a lot of flavor, but the cooks must have dropped the salt shaker in this thing because that thing was way too salty. The bread they served it with was good but they literally only give you one small bread and we had 4 people at the table? A little stingy. 

Now, the entrees. I ordered the half bird which was $17 dollars and I chose the crispy potato wedges and I got a side sauce of jalapeno pesto and the Jamaican jerk marmalade. While the chicken was definitely moist and delicious, the sauces were a huge let down. If you are going to charge me for sauce then it better be some damn good sauce, which it wasn't. The jalapeno pesto was just average and it lacked flavor and spice and the Jamaican jerk marmalade was way to sweet for my palate. I came with my wife and my parents and they all ordered different pizzas from the aviator to the wild mushroom to the crispy pastrami. All of them were pretty decent, just nothing really special stood out to me. I wish there were more mushrooms on the wild mushroom and their use of \"black truffle\" was basically nonexistent. The aviator with all the meats on it was good but the meats made the pizza really greasy. 

Luckily, Doughbird was able to redeem themselves with the desserts. We ordered two desserts, the Peach Streusel Pie and the Butterscotch Cake. Both of these desserts were so delightful. The butterscotch cake was probably my favorite, so warm and buttery with a creamy scoop of vanilla bean ice cream to top it off. Overall, I think my expectations were just very high for this place, and it didn't really meet them which kinda let me down. I think they need to make a few changes to menu to make it seem more appealing. I won't be begging to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Whenever I have a friend come to town and want to try some local cuisine, I immediately think of the Fox Restaurant Concepts.  So many creative concepts, and Doughbird is one of the latest.  Ironically, my two favorite cuisines are pizza and chicken.  What do you get when you combine the two?  Doughbird, of course!!  I just went last night to Doughbird for my second time since it had opened, and to be honest, I'm not sure why I don't go on a regular basis.  Great concept, easy parking, short waits, good service, and delicious food!  

During my first visit, my guest and I both shared a truffle cheese stromboli appetizer, I ordered the free range chicken (half) and she ordered carmelized cauliflower.  My chicken came with macaroni and cheese as a side dish.  We then ordered pie for dessert.  Last night, we shared a pizza and a caesar salad.  Note that you can have a pizza personalized as you wish.  You do not have to stick with the options given on the menu (though they do sound pretty good).  All the food tasted delicious!  

My only thoughts were that the prices are a bit high for pizza or chicken, and again, as a fan of both foods, it would be amazing to have a combination of pizza and chicken in one dish.  Perhaps a slice of pizza and some chicken?  I'm sure the restaurant can think up something more creative than that.  Also, the menu should mention that pizzas can be personalized.  Those were just a few of my thoughts.  

The restaurant is one of many that can be found on the corner of 44th Street and Indian School Road (southwest corner).  Both times, I found myself with many options for parking and only a short wait upon arrival.  Waiting for food took a little while during my first visit but was pretty quick during yesterday's visit.   I did learn after the fact that you can make a reservation on their website or on OpenTable.  When you sign up for their e-mail list, you can get $10 off a $20 purchase during your next visit."}
{"text":"Awesome food!
We love doughbird and so does our 2 year old son! Cute patio too! We've had several large gatherings with family and friends and service has been great, kid friendly and yummy pizza"}
{"text":"I have to fix my review.  There was an issue with Postmates orders before getting lost in the shuffle but now that they have upgraded to a tablet, things are running smooth as silk!  I do love the food and the atmosphere so it pained me to have to leave a bad review.  Thank you Doughbird for addressing my concerns and fixing the problem.  Shows how much you care about your customers!"}
{"text":"Another good solid offering from Fox Restaurant Concept. We ordered the Margherita Pizza and half of a rotisserie chicken. Everything was really good especially the side of asparagus and broccolini as well as the pineapple teriyaki sauce that I chose for the chicken. My husband and I shared our entrees and my only wish would be the pizza crust be \"crispier\".  We will definitely go back and like to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"We had the pepperoni and burrata pizza and the chicken and avocado salad. The pizza was tasty. It had a nice crust that had a good chew to it. The space is nice and open, good for groups."}
{"text":"Laid back, hip casual food joint. Homemade pizzas are awesome. My favorite is their roasted cauliflower with Jamaican jerk sauce... Delicious! The salmon is to die for too. 
A bit on the pricey side, but well worth the unique taste!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I have had in a while!! The service was super fast and the atmosphere is really fun. The rotisserie chicken is also amazing, we got it with the Jamaican jerk sauce and it was really good"}
{"text":"Second time here.  Gotten better each time.  Really good food and service.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I would rate this place 3 and a half. The extra half star is for the space. I really liked the feel of the space with glass all around and a simple openness to it. Being from NYC I am slightly picky about my thin crust pizzas but we will try to put that aside for this review. I am on a lookout for the best pie in Phoenix and have been seeing this place under construction for a while so had to check it out once they threw their doors open. 

They have decent options, but a limited selection for vegetarians. On this visit I tried the shishito peppers and mushroom pizza. The peppers were oki but I loved the umami sauce they came with. The pizza was nice the crust was slightly thicker but I actually preferred it as it did not get too soggy. I loved their house made chilli oil not sure if it went well with my pizza but I am sure I could add a kick to the basic margarita . Will come back again to give it a fair chance. Hope they have some daily specials or more veggie options."}
{"text":"The service was amazing. The food was good, but I can't justify spending $95 on pizza, 1/2 chicken and 2 glasses of house wine. This place is overrated and over priced."}
{"text":"It's another Fox winner. The place was already packed at 5:45 on a weeknight.
We ordered the whole roasted Chicken. It was juicy and flavorful. But it is not a very large Chicken. And there lies the rub. JK.
We started with 2 salads. An Apple and goat cheese and a chopped. Both were tasty. Service was good. Easy to park in their lot."}
{"text":"Amazing food for a great price.

This place has chicken and pizza down like no other. When I first heard about it, I was speculating as to what I should expect from a place that serves chicken and pizza. Now I totally understand; they go so well together when shared with friends. I love how when I sit at the bar I can watch all of the pizzas being made from scratch and you can really notice how much detail and care they put into each one. The noice level is nothing that will get in the way of a nice dinner, and service is fast and servers are very friendly. Well worth the price as well, the prime rib is to die for. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Lynyrd Skynyrd - Freebird)

And if I ate here with you Yelp
Things just couldn't be the same
Cause I'll eat a half bird now

And this bird you'll split and roast, oh.......
And this bird you'll split and roast,
And this bird you'll split and roast,

Yelp knows, I can sing
Yelp, help me, I can sing......
Yelp, I can sing
Won't you review, Doughbird, yeah!?



Mr. Fox has done it again with Doughbird; a pizza and rotisserie chicken restaurant.  The restaurant itself is as always beautiful like most Fox restaurants.  It has a open and farm to table look with a brunch-like atmosphere.

I came with a friend and sat at the bar and started with some cocktails.  For our appetizers we ordered the Lebanese Hummus, Heirloom Tomatoes, and Heath Bread.  The bread was warm to the bite almost like it was freshly baked; while the hummus was smooth and creamy!  The tomatoes provided a sweet texture; I went two rounds of the bread!  For our entrees with share the Rocky Free Range Chicken, but only half of it.  For our sides we chose the Cauliflower Mash along with the Horseradish Creme Fraiche and Jamaican Jerk Marmalade sauce for our chicken.  We also ordered the Bacon and Truffle Egg pizza, yeah I know what you're thinking; that's a lot of food!?  Yes, indeed it was!  

The chicken was done to perfection; crispy skin and warm soft chewy meat within.  The horseradish stung my sinus, but was subtle enough to ease onto my palates.  The marmalade with sweet and spicy which I like with my chicken.  The cauliflower mashed was one of my favorite bites of the night with chunks of cauliflower still available giving it a texture along with the creaminess.  Our pizza I thought was okay since it was more of a breakfast pizza because of the chunks of eggs and bacon.  I didn't really get a taste of the truffles, but definitely needed some more truffle oil.  

In the end, Doughbird is a spot worth trying.  The food here is pretty solid and you can't beat a Fox Restaurant atmosphere! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time and at 2:30 in the afternoon on a Thursday, only a few other people in there. We ordered the chicken Cesar salad and the apple and goat cheese salad. Both had a decent flavor, portions could have been a little bigger. We both added chicken to our salad which was almost not there. Bit into a piece of chicken and nearly choked on a bone in the chicken. This bone was about and an inch and a half long and as wide as a fettuccine noodle. When we told the waitress, she seemed concerned and said she would be back. The manager then comes over and said he was coming to check on us and how things were since the waitress saw a chunk of chicken on the table. (Ummmm.... What?)  The manager then excuses it by saying, \"Well, it is rotiserre chicken.\" He asked if he could take the chicken out the table, he picked it up with his bare hands (gross- half chewed chicken) and walked away. I guess asking for a bone free salad is too ask. He knows all chicken is originally on bones and someone has to remove it right? I give it two stars because the salad seemed pretty fresh."}
{"text":"Doughbird does it right! I'm glad to have been able to try the latest and greatest Sam Fox concept this past Friday. The interior is reminiscent of the Fox's other locations, most similarly North and The Yard. Luckily we got there early enough to grab a seat at the bar for some Happy Hour. 

I ordered The Local {strawberry | arcadia grapefruit vodka | lemon} as my first cocktail and it was just the perfect amount of tart and refreshing.  My friend ordered the Bourbon & Bells {buffalo trace bourbon | smashed bell pepper | clover honey | ancho reyes poblano | lemon} the drink was perfectly balanced with the spiciness of the peppers with the sweetness of the honey. 

The bartender recommended we start with the Lebanese hummus, served with heirloom tomatoes and hearth bread. The hearth bread is actually the same as what they use for the pizza crust and it was perfectly soft and warm. The hummus itself was smooth and creamy. The tomatoes acidity added a great flavor making this probably one of my favorite hummus appetizers I've had lately. 

We decided to order way too much food and also got the Bacon & Truffled egg pizza and half a rotisserie chicken. The chicken comes with a side and a sauce.  We got the cauliflower mash and two sauces: horseradish cr√®me fraiche and the Jamaican jerk marmalade. My favorite was the horseradish, perfectly spicy and creamy. The Jamaican marmalade was wonderful as well. The cauliflower mash inspired me to make my own at home- but I still see myself coming back for more here! 

The pizza was stellar, as expected. It was basically a breakfast pizza with the bacon and egg. The truffle oil wasn't too heavy or overwhelming like it can be sometimes. If I didn't show some self-control I would have eaten the whole thing! 

I was very surprised at how great everything was considering this is a newer spot, but they seem to have worked out any kinks and I look forward to many more visits!"}
{"text":"Tried this cool and trendy place for lunch. Had the 1/2 free range chicken. Great flavor. Will be back for sure to try the dough part. Only bad thing was that parking is a bit difficult.

One more thing, a place like this should NEVER serve Pepsi. What a sellout. Usually B and C rated restaurants do so to save money, but still, I can't dock them a full star for that so just know this is really a 4 1/2."}
{"text":"Great and easy going atmosphere. The brussel sprout pizza is amazing and packed with flavor. If you're in the mood to trying something different mid-day, come here!"}
{"text":"The parking was great and we got seated right away..at 330pm on a Sunday so that was good. It wasn't crowded yet so I asked the hostess if I could have a booth s I didn't like the table she sat us at in the middle of the restaurant. She had an attitude and said the booths were for reservations. It was funny since there were 8-9 open booths. She then went back to the hostess stand and was talking about us to the other hostess and they both looked my way. It was so unprofessional. Drinks took a bit and they were out of a few beers on the menu. Food was good but I would not go back. Could have gone to many restaurants for the price and will not be back. I do frequent most of the Fox restaurants and have had much better experiences."}
{"text":"Ok ANOTHER Sam Fox concept in the Arcadia area!  C'mon man!  You just can't keep churning out concept after concept and not think that at some point its not going to live up to expectations...well Doughbird...YOU ROCK!  Now this is a artisan pizza place with rotisserie chicken as the two main players.  Me and the wife had the stromboli appetizer.  Its a 3 cheese stromboli it was fantastic!  A simple albeit small calzone-like dish.  A little pricey but tasted very good!  We had the mushroom pizza and that was freakin' awesome!!  Crust was light and airy the mushrooms actually tasted like mushrooms, very fresh!!  It also had arugula as well as truffle oil...wow what a great pizza!  We also tried the side dish of asparagus and broccolini and even that was a great side dish.  Needless to say we will be back to try other dishes sich as the prime rib dip and the pizza with pastrami.  The wife did get dessert which was the peach pie with vanilla gelato and she throughly enjoyed that.  It has oats as a topping and it was very delicious!  That wraps up this review so if you're in the Arcadia area near 44th and Indian School stop by however fair warning, make reservations since this is a new concept and in a very popular area.  And oh, the service was EXCELLENT!!!  Conner was our server and he was unbelievably fantastic!!!!!  Can't wait until next time"}
{"text":"very pricey for the product. Chicken ok but trying to foo foo up other
items like a basic sandwich...na...use normal bread ...just not really
appealing."}
{"text":"Cute name great place to have a great meal.
Just make sure to call in for a reservation.
Fifth day they were open a friend of mine and I decided to check it out. We had to wait almost 1 hour for a table and there must have been 10 tables available.
But no one would give a table. Finally we got to try it out and we split a pizza and a ice tea.
Then on 7/8/17 I made a reservation for 2 @ 4:45 we arrived and there must have been 15 tables open and within 35 minutes every table was filled with happy and hunger patrons. 
I sat at a table looking towards the kitchen and was amazed on how well the waiters and waitresses keep from running into each other. I complimented Martin Granillo the restaurant manager on how his staff had impressed me. 
Now on the food review the Free Range Half Chicken was very tasty. I ordered mine with the Greek yogurt feta sauce and my friend had the garlic one and OMG they both were very yummy.
I really like this place because it is very family friendly and so is the staff.
Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and excellent tasting food. I love the menu concepts they've come up with. Love the roasted chicken!"}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for a while and am really glad I decided to stop in for lunch. I came just after opening on a weekday and it was already starting to get busy. By the time I left, there was a wait...for lunch...on a weekday! 

I sat at the bar, really nice seating and enjoyed watching the line cooks prepare the food. I ordered the margherita pizza and a side of mac and cheese. The pizza was delicious but the mac and cheese for me was just OK. Their prices are a lot too...$3.50 for a regular sized soda and $5 for a side of mac and cheese. With tip, I walked out at just under $30.

I saw many things I would order though so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Another Fox Restaurant success. Would recommend to any and all fans of pizza and rotisserie chicken. 

The shishito pepper appetizer is amazing, the BBQ pizza is fantastic, and the Reuben and Chicken sandwiches are wonderful. 

Advice: Make a reservation ahead of time to make sure you avoid the long wait as it is so popular that it's extremely busy."}
{"text":"We are visiting from California and I wish we had a place like this to go!!  Love, love everything about it! Service, food, ambiance. It is a must!"}
{"text":"We live in the area and we are always trying new restaurants. You can tell it is a Fox Restaurant Concept, as the restaurant itself reminds me a bit of North (which I love) with the openness of the space and natural light. I loved their booths and their bar. I really liked the use of space and decor- well done! 

We went with my in-laws on a Sunday (2 weeks ago) at about 5pm- there was a 30-40 minute wait. You see a lot of families with their kids, which I think is great. The service is great, friendly servers that have good knowledge of the menu. 

When it comes to the food- We were not impressed with the food. We ordered two dinner salads, pizza and half chicken with cauliflower mash as the side. It cracks me up that usually they offer cauliflower instead of potatoes because it is supposed to be healthier, but it would had been healthier to have regular potatoes judging by the amount of butter, cheese or whipping cream that the cauliflower had- whatever it had (which was delicious) was very, very heavy, which defeats the purpose. We just had a bite. So, food was ok, nothing to remember. The prices felt particularly high because of the \"blah\" dinner. I honestly wouldn't go back to this particular Fox Concept Restaurant, there are others that we like better with the same prices, but delicious food."}
{"text":"Went with some friends for Galentines last night and had some amazing food. The truffle stromboli was so good!!! The brussel sprout pizza my friend got was like a taste explosion in my mouth. Sweet from the sweet potato, salty from bacon, your taste buds were awoken when you first bit into it. I had the prime rib dip that was good as well, but nothing special. My other friend had the crispy pastrami and that was good as well. Good service and good food. I would go back to try other items."}
{"text":"I like rotisserie chicken when it's cooked properly and here they cook it ot perfection.  I had the very tasty red curry chicken special and it didn't disappoint.  Normally the chicken is half or whole with a selection of sauces.  The pizza is good but nothing special.  The desserts are pretty good and the cocktail list is decent.  

For some reason whenever I come here my meal gets forgotten or lost or whatever by the person expediting.  My friends call the doughbird jinx.  I thought it was because I was ordering appetizers but of course the tables next to me order apps and get their meals in a reasonable amount of time.   So if you're not unlucky like me, it's nice casual place to eat."}
{"text":"Get the whole bird! Delicious, tender and moist!  Excellent service too. Pizza was good, but the chicken was really good."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and atmosphere. This is a favorite for group dinners and girls nights! The pizzas are to die for."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great pizza and a very interesting take on guacamole. If you're ok with mixing up a tradition, it's well worth a shot. Everyone working there is very friendly and the crowd is usually lively. The industrial ceiling and the awesome floor are a good view when chomping on pizza and chugging drinks"}
{"text":"Super awesome atmosphere at this place. Not too loud and tables are spaced out nice. My sister and I shared a whole bird along with two sides and we were stuffed by the end and unfortunately were too full for dessert. Waiter was very nice and helpful, giving us some good suggestions."}
{"text":"So my brother and I, who are both vegan, just ate here. The staff is amazing and helping us find something that fit our dietary restrictions. We got the mushroom pizza with olive oil instead of sauce. It was absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"First visit to DoughBird and despite it being open for only 30 mins there was already a 20 min wait so we grabbed so bar seats instead (great place to watch the kitchen!) Anyways the service was great per usual at a Sam Fox restaurant but the food was just ok/good nothing that we had to write home about. We had garden chop with chicken that could have used a few more pieces of chicken and half order of chicken with umami & mac and cheese. The chicken was good but the skin was star- super tasty and flavorful!"}
{"text":"Love the chicken and pizza. Very busy though. The dipping sauces are great. Fantastic patio when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Super Delicious! Place was packed even at 2pm on a weekday and I can see why. Rotisserie chicken melted in my mouth. Only complaint is the pricey food but I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very close to my house so I was extremely excited to get to try it so my husband ordered takeout. The chicken is pretty good and had great flavor, the pizza was just OK and very greasy and the broccoli was not cooked and so salty I threw it away. I know they are fairly new and because of the convenience I will give them another try. They are a new restaurant so hopefully with some small tweaks the food will be amazing."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic! The pizzas here are great and they have many options for vegetarians and vegans. I wish I could've tried the rotisserie chicken, but that's for next time. Quite expensive I must say. Very busy but good service and the food came out quickly."}
{"text":"I was so excited to give his place a try and when I finally did, it wasn't what I hoped it would be. The atmosphere is beautiful and natural lighting all around. They have an awesome menu and are pretty much known for their pizzas and chicken served in different ways. 

We ordered the tomato & quinoa salad and the pepperoni pizza. The salad was so good!! It had fresh toasted pine nuts and a beautiful yogurt creamy dressing.  I asked for fresh mozzarella for the pepperoni pizza because that's what differs this place from others. When we got the pizza it didn't have any fresh mozzarella. I was disappointed but didn't want to say anything; just let it slide and we enjoyed our pizza. It was more on the salty side. 

I give this place a 3/5 mainly because of service. Our server seemed to be a bit annoyed and made us feel uncomfortable. 

When we asked for straws for our drinks, it wasn't brought to us until 10 minutes had passed. I hate drinking straight from the cup and to wait that long for straws seemed so utterly unprofessional and tacky. 

We also didn't even ask if we wanted to try any desserts and were given the check right away. 

The owners of this place also own north Italia and Green House and I know that they have amazing dessert choices and I felt like we were being rushed to get out of there. 

It definitely disappointed me because like I said, I was very excited to try this place!"}
{"text":"This place is so hip! I loved the decor.... Clean and stylish! We went here with some friends. I got the chicken and avocado salad and a side of the potato wedges that I heard so much about. I let the waitress know that I didn't want cheese on the salad, and she was really great about making sure that there wasn't cheese/dairy on any of my food due to an allergy. My husband got a pastrami sandwich and potato wedges as well. Our friends, got another salad and a pizza. Everything we ordered came out perfectly. I love the freshness of the rotisserie chicken on my salad! The potato wedges were everything! Crispy and soft in the middle. I loved them! My husband really like to sandwich, especially the bread which I'm assuming was their homemade dough. Service was excellent! I just wish this place was closer to home! I would be there all the time!!"}
{"text":"As others have said, the large windows allowing sunlight to spread across the entire restaurant is REALLY nice! The ambiance here, is on point. Despite a small hiccup with our wings coming late (Manager kindly took them off our bill) the service was impeccable. However... next time we come, we'll skip the dough and go for the bird. Both of our pizzas were overcooked to the point where the toppings were hard and chewy. The avocado chicken salad was one of the best salads I have ever had. Same with the wings. Ah Mazin!"}
{"text":"this is a great place to eat if you have any desire to order pizza and chicken at the same time. The chicken was awesome the drinks were even better, this place has sort of a rustic feel to it and the inside is beautiful. Plenty of seating which is great. I would suggest ordering the chicken."}
{"text":"the local cocktail needed something...basil? carbonation? not sure but felt incomplete
stromboli appetizer is just cheese and dough, skip it. the marinara dipping sauce is a dollar extra
pizza was greasy, nothing particularly special about it.
Service was great, our waiter was really friendly
Hostesses wearing coordinating denim skirts and similar tops and booties and their hair done exactly the same way gave me sorority flashbacks- seemed out of place and weird 
50 bucks for 1 pizza 1 cocktail and 1 app was not worth it"}
{"text":"Super trendy, super hip, decent service, decent food, way too expensive. We live in the neighborhood and love their sister restaurant The North. We thought we would give it a shot. Lucky day though, they were giving 25% off your bill. Since I saved 25% I didn't feel as bad. Chicken is good but not $17.00 good. The prime rib sandwich was good too, but not $17.00 good.  Servers are typical hipsters, friendly but awkward. It's just chicken and pizza, but it feels so serious. Lower the prices and the pretentiousness and you might have something here."}
{"text":"So, I finally made it to Doughbird. I live in Chandler, so I planned to meet my son, daughter and son's girlfriend. The decor is lovely. My son and girlfriend live nearby so they were the experts on this visit. Lots of chatter about the pizza. I wanted chicken. So did my daughter. She's also a newbie. We shared the 1/2 chicken. She ordered mac and cheese and cucumber/feta sauce. I had asparagus side dish and lemon garlic sauce. My son had 1/2 chicken. His girlfriend had the pepperoni pizza. She wants us to try it. Pizza was good but lukewarm at best. Asparagus was good, my lemon garlic was amazing. Again, my food was not hot. My daughter ordered a side of mac and cheese. She received French fries (never ordered). They brought the mac and cheese I swear it was nothing more than something I could make at home from a box. At one point, our waiter brought someone over who appeared to be a manager. She approached my son and started apologizing for something. Waiter cut her off mid sentence and she walked away as she was talking to the wrong table. No, sorry about, how are things here. Just an abrupt departure. So sorry she wasn't talking to me, I would have given her an earful about all these issues related to my visit. Chicken was good with sauce. My daughter was sure her chicken was undercooked. And to wrap up the night, my stomach has not the same since my visit. I want to go back but I don't think I can.
I love Sauce. My daughter worked at Sauce at the airport. I love several other Sam Fox restaurants. Not sure I can pay for another $70 stomach ache."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch to try it out. Perfect except a bit on the pricey side. Passion fruit iced tea is delicious and subtle and unsweetened. Small Caesar salad freshly dressed with homemade croutons and garlicky dressing. Fresh crisp sweet romaine. Got the Pastrami-kale-gruyere Pizza. Wood fired crust thin and crisp with good crusty edges. Also contained pickled whole mustard seeds for that hint of pastrami on rye!!  Fabulous servers, too."}
{"text":"Awesome food and drinks! We came in with a table of 8 for a graduation celebration and Taylor was great. Excellent service and super accommodating! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ehhhh. I was super excited for this restaurant and it was just okay. Some what expensive for food that's not great. Also get more beer selection! Can't be a pizza place and have so few beer options. Go to Chelseas Kitchen instead, better food, great patio."}
{"text":"Ok, just had dinner and I was pleasantly surprised. I had the 1/2 chicken special that they donate $2 to St Mary's food bank. Chicken was good and juicy and they paired it with sage dressing and cranberry sauce. Very good. Not too fond of the Brussels sprouts, if they're too charred, they tend to become bitter on the char. But it was an enjoyable meal. Husband had a pizza with too much salty meat...almost too salty for him. Probably best to get a pizza with maybe a vegetable and meat, instead of all salty meat. But cheese was good and crust was yummy. Glad they had a 6 and an 8 oz wine pour. 6oz is \"standard pour\" but the 8 oz is more like you'd poor at home. 6 oz not enough, 12 oz(2 glasses) maybe too much. I'm appreciative that a friend gave me a $25.00 fox gift certificate, otherwise it would have been a little too expensive. So a gift certificate would be a great gift idea for Xmas. Not sure we would spend so much money to eat there often, but nice for something special. Nice atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"Doughbird is my new found love! You walk in and the restaurant is beautifully decorated with lots of natural light. The food was delicious! We ordered the Brussels Sprout pizza and the half bird rotisserie with corn and the lemon and garlic sauce. The Brussels Sprout pizza was pretty amazing. I brought some home to my hubby and he said the same thing. The service wasn't bad either. This restaurant is definitely a place worth visiting again and again."}
{"text":"First impression. Not impressed. No parking unless valet has a spot (have tip money) so don't plan on driving. 

Hostesses were busy talking to each other and didn't acknowledge us for several minutes so we opted for a spot at the bar. 

We ordered a salmon dinner and drinks and an app. Plates were left out and we had to ask to have someone take them. My drink wasn't refilled and another server actually filled our glasses and took our plates. Thanks Shaina. 

There were two gals in the kitchen area (later found out they were from corporate) were loud and one was dressed very sloppily. No tucked in shirt. Bad shoes and messy hair.  Definitely didn't look like she belonged. And if this is corporate leading by example then they need some training  

The other gal had a huge pine sticking out of her jeans and not sure if her dark hair ended up in my salmon. But that was pretty gross. And salmon was dry. 

Can't say I have any desire to return."}
{"text":"Freaking awesome. Freaking Awesome. The Indian Style Chicken was amazing. The honey ham pizza was on point with the pineapple and the Truffle cheese bread was awesome."}
{"text":"We loved it!   The place just has a great, open feel with a pleasant, modern d√©cor.  Not too noisy... good energy but could still enjoy good conversation.  Service was enthusiastic, friendly and professional.  Fun menu, delicious food (we had pizza and cole slaw, but will try the chicken next time!), and bathrooms were spotless (to us, that indicates good management and attention to detail)."}
{"text":"This was recommended to me by a friend and I was finally able to try it tonight with a buddy of mine. First impression of the inside was awesome, it has a very welcoming and homey feel and cool set up outside with firepits and a modern look. We were seated immediately and greeted by our server Arvand who was very polite and attentive, refilling our drinks like clockwork and multiple, multiple times which I've never had happen outside of a fancy steakhouses. 
We both had the cream soda which was by far the best I've had, they apparently use a combination of Stevia and cane sugar and it just tastes amazing.
For our entree we split half a rotisserie chicken and got the wild mushroom pizza at the recommendation of Arvand as we we're between that and the margherita. We got a side of potato wedges and two sauces (comes with one sauce included, additional sauces are $1) with the chicken, a lemon garlic sauce and a Jamaican jerk sauce. Lemon garlic was good and a classic sauce for chicken, but the Jamaican jerk was even better with a sort of sweet and spicy taste. The chicken itself was fine, nothing to write home about.
The pizza was so good, literally. I would go back just for that mushroom pizza (well and the cream soda). In the future, I'd come back for the pizza but the chicken isn't that special unfortunately."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! Amazing food, drinks, and service! Thanks for taking awesome care of us Craig!"}
{"text":"Another huge success for the Fox Restaurants group.  We tried 3 different pizza's and the rotisserie chicken.  Oh yeah we also split 3 desserts that were great"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The chicken with pesto jalape√±o sauce is to die for. I even went home to attempt to make it. Plan for a wait when you go to this place. Sometimes and hour, it might be because it's just opened but it seems all fox restaurants have wait times... but don't worry, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"A recent visit to the area brought us to Doughbird to try this fox concepts restaurant. We shared an appetizer of the truffle cheese Stromboli which was very good. Hubby enjoyed his 1/2 chicken dinner with cauliflower mashed potatoes and horseradish dipping sauce. I had a Caesar salad and was able to add some of his chicken to my salad. They also serve pizza here which we will try at another time. 
The restaurant is beautiful with indoor and outdoor dining. During the busy dinner hours they have complimentary valet. 
We both enjoyed the food but found it to be on the pricey side at $17 for his chicken and $9.00 for my salad. Appetizer was $12.00. 
Honey is the \"chicken connoisseur\" of the family and said the chicken was moist both dark and white meat. I wish they had more options as far as chicken goes, but a solid performance."}
{"text":"Went here for the second time on a Friday night. I'm really glad I came back as I was a bit underwhelmed with my first visit. My boyfriend and I split the veggie salad as a starter. It was good but missing \"something\"...a pistachio or something would really complete it. Regardless, still enjoyed. We also ordered the BBQ chicken pizza. I'm traditionally not a fan of this pizza other places as the sauce often is too sweet. That is NOT the case here. The BBQ sauce is subtle and balanced so nicely with the spicy pesto sauce. The crust was cooked perfectly. We absolutely loved it and look forward to coming back for it again. It was definitely crowded, as expected on a Friday, but we nabbed seats at the bar within about 10 minutes and the service there was great. 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time. Service was excellent, food was excellent and to watch an open kitchen is quite a show. Sit at the bar and see what a fine tuned machine this is. Executive Chef Zach was amazing to watch. Christina was an amazing waitress. She recommended the perfect wine and desert. We will definitely return here when we visit our kids in college!"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of pizza places and I've done a lot of reviews for yelp and let me tell you something!!, this place is five stars, their service excellent food and reasonable prices, the crust is a 10 plus!!! Its the way you make the crust, crispy and very tasteful!!! Best pizza i have had in a long time!!!! You have to try the try the pastrami pizza!!! Never seen that before, its great, this place got it right!!!!"}
{"text":"Had so much fun sitting at the bar! The food is great, so are drinks. Pretty similar to the other fox concepts but great nonetheless. Usually a wait."}
{"text":"Have been here twice; once at the bar and another time with guests at a table.  Was not disappointed in the food or service either time.  Had two different varieties as well as appetizers; nothing disappointed.  Service very attentive, even when crowded.  One weird observation: this is the third restaurant in the last month that I have ordered a \"vodka tonic with a squeeze of lime\" and received a vodka with lime juice (tastes like limeade with a kick).  Even the manager cam over to explain how the bartender makes them.  WRONG!  It's simple; vodka, club soda, squeeze a lime wedge and leave it on the rim of the glass.  From now on I'm asking for a vodka soda with a lime wedge on the side."}
{"text":"We had such a great date night here! The salads were yummy, the sandwich was good, and the pizzas great! 

The server recommended the Brussels sprouts pizza but we didn't think it was that great. The BBQ chicken was so good and the table favorite was the Spiral Ham pizza! That is where it's at!! So good! We sat outside and I love it because the atmosphere wasn't too loud and it was easier to visit with our large group."}
{"text":"I liked Doughbird, I think that there is better pizza around the valley but it isn't bad. The best part of the meal was the chicken.. so delicious, and the mac&cheese side was great too. The pizza was good but it wasn't the best... I thought it was a little soggy & not crisp enough, you had to literally use both hands to keep the toppings on, but the taste was great. Also, I'm more of a wine person, but the cocktails were great!"}
{"text":"First off, our waitress is amazing! Our first trip to check it out and the wait wasnt long, the food is wonderful; the staff and vibe are perfect! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome employees. We had a large group and our waiter was super helpful and knowledgeable. The restaurant was clean and open. Lots of light and cute decor. I got the oven roast fish and broccolini as well as the peach pie for dessert.
Everything was so delicious. My friend got the prime rib and it looked so delicious! I will definitely go back and it is family friendly. We went on a Tuesday night and it was pretty busy. I would definitely make reservations!"}
{"text":"Once again, Sam Fox nails it with Dough Bird. I have yet to go to a Fox Restaurant I didn't like. I'll admit I'm a total fan girl!

My husband and I stopped into Dough Bird on a Thursday night around 7 and the place was packed. But luckily we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.

We decided we needed to try the dough and the bird so we got a pizza and a half chicken. The pizza was pepperoni and burrata. It had great flavor and the crust was done perfectly. The pepperoni made it a little greasy but not too bad. It certainly didn't stop us from devouring it. The chicken was delish. Really juicy and the skin was nicely browned. We had the pineapple teriyaki sauce which was awesome. I could eat a whole bunch of that stuff. And for our side we went with the mac and cheese which was super good. I could eat a bunch of that stuff too. 

Friendly staff, comfortable atmosphere and great food. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Pretentious! And as one person put it Style over substance.

Ok I have that out of my system so how was the food actually?

I had the pepperoni and Mozzarella and it was delicious, OK wonderful. The crust was thin but not cracker thin, the pepperoni was about dime size but there was lots of it. I had to ask for cracked pepper but it came fast and overall I really enjoyed the pizza. BUT - for lunch and the area way overpriced - pretentious remember?

My associate was not impressed from the git go and only ordered a house Caesar salad which they did not eat. They used Romain and then only the bottom part where the leaves are like celery. I know, I know, that is how it is supposed to be made but I tried it and would have sent it back, he didn't. The dressing was too heavy and had too much ground up cheese in it making it grainy. 

Bottom line - the place is very open, very clean, service is on time and efficient, and the food  seems to be well done. However as I am not a millennial or a Yuppy it just seemed over priced and pretentious to me. 

Just for comparison so you know my proclivities - I like Sierra Bonita, Lon's at the Hermosa, and Rosy McAferty's for comparison.

Glad I went once but like the Buck and Rider - never again."}
{"text":"Okay, so by now you may have heard this place is about chicken and pizza. That's correct, but it's more than just chicken and pizza. It's tender, fall apart in your mouth perfectly seasoned chicken, with beautifully crafted pizzas that are pretty phenomenal. But not only that, the prime rib. Oooohhhh the prime rib . Ridiculous. Although this place is a bit pricey, it's quite the experience and definitely worth it. 

Here's what we tried.

1) the whole chicken - with jalape√±o pesto 
Solid choice. 

2) the 14oz prime rib - with horseradish cr√©me fraiche 
Beautiful. The bite with the salt peppery crust and a chunk of the fat with the tender meat...  tears in my eyes. OH and the potato pur√©e. Oh man. Delish. 

3) the black truffle pizza ? I think that's what it's called. This one was pretty interesting... when it comes the first thing that hits you is the smell. Like BAM. Truffle in face. If that's your thing, it's solid. If not, look somewhere else. 

4) the aviator - a very solid meat pizza  very delicious. It was the first thing to go on our table. 

5) a \"stubborn\" root beer - it's like regular root beer except it's made with cane sugar, a little flatter, and leans a bit towards cream soda. Interesting. 

Service was very friendly :) and the place is hip and beautiful. Come and try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"The best way to describe our experience for dinner was average. The salad was good, but small. The pizzas sounded amazing but we're okay and not packed with flavor and crunch. There are many other options not far like humble pie, parlor and more much better. The chicken is like a rotisserie chicken from Costco (which is pretty decent i must say) but with good sauces. Desert menu limited. Service seemed disorganized but it's still early being one month open. This restaurant group has some winners like the Henry, but unfortunately this may not be one of them."}
{"text":"Typical underwhelming, overpriced food of a fox concept.  Except the hummus was awesome.

Hummus - 5 star.   A pleasant surprise 
Stromboli -4 star.  Needed some marinara to dip it in
Pizza -3.5 star.  Good but can think of a dozen places I would rather go within 10 minute drive.  We had the pepperoni.  
Chicken Caesar 1- star  the chicken on it sucked. Half was Fatty dark meat scraps that went uneaten. 


Service was a train wreck but place is new.        I'm sure it will improve.  Just get back to basics like not letting a customer wait for 30 minutes with an empty glass of water, and not giving us a hard time about splitting 130 check between 2 couples."}
{"text":"It has taken me a couple months, but I finally got around to trying this place and it totally exceeded my expectations. My wife and I are on a ketogenic diet, so we tend to struggle finding restaurants where we can eat without cheating, or sticking to the salad menu.

We ordered a half chicken, mashed cauliflower, with lemon garlic sauce. It was cooked perfectly, and carved in such a way that made it very easy to eat with fork and knife. The white and dark meat were both moist, skin had lots of flavor, and the portion size was perfect for 2 modest eaters. The ability to add on sides makes it scalable for hungrier folks. 

Service was excellent as well, and the decor was very cozy."}
{"text":"-hey yelp!--
the name of this restaurant is not Doughbird.   
It's Dough Bird. Sorta like calling a Suzanne, Susan. It's not correct. 

11/31/2017--

Did the whole she-bang: 1 whole chicken, 2 sides, 2 sauces, Chardonnay...$60 for me, 1 person, that is w/ tip. 

The chicken is excellent. There is no way around it, no reason to try and find a way around it; the chicken is excellent. 

Sauces: The boys in the band--which is to say the guys behind bar--they like the jalape√±o sauce the best -- I thought it was good, nowhere near great. The cream fraiche sauce is just fabulous. Maybe my severe acid reflux has so badly jaded my taste buds that only things with horseradish taste good...?   But I'll tell you this: I think that sauce is terrific!!

Mashed potatoes: somebody somewhere is going to say they've had better mashed potatoes but I'll tell you this much: these are pretty good. And while you're eating these mashed potatoes you can't eat anybody else's mashed potatoes so these these will do just fine. 

Note: restaurants nowadays I notice far too frequently people touching their face, their hair, their person, and the first thing you learn in any food handlers situation is that ¬°hands! are the number one method of transmission of colds and flu. So it freaks me out when I see people doing touching their person. The restaurants
know better, Mgt too, personnel has been instructed better, hell! they had to pass a test just to work there!

Having said that, Dough Bird get a really good grade, nice job, on behalf of the employees PROPERLY following simple food handlers protocol. 

I LIKE THIS SPOT. I don't know if it's a good value but it's good food."}
{"text":"Wow... just wow!  I had a feeling this restaurant would be delicious and a fun experience, but I was blown away.  We were greeted with genuine warmth by the two hostesses.  Our server was attentive, fun, and excellent.  The FOOD IS SO GOOD!  Great wine list too!  Clean, fun, great people, delicious food, and happy customers.  We can't wait to go back and try more!  Fun concept!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I have been here twice and probably won't be back again.  Very poor effort by Sam fox on this one. The building is brand-new but really boring and square. The inside is like a cafeteria and very noisy. The outside patio is just a strip of concrete and the traffic is super loud.  I thought the food selection was poor. The only thing that was halfway decent was the Stromboli.  I ordered chicken BLT and it was terrible. It was basically chicken salad with shredded lettuce. Other people in my group had pizza. The consistency of the sauce and cheese was very poor. Within minutes, the pizza was cold and clammy. Lots of good restaurants in Arcadia. I would be surprised if this one lasts very long"}
{"text":"They have a great gluten free pizza, one of the best I've had! I really like the pepperoni and burrata."}
{"text":"This place was super yummy! Been wanting to come since they opened not so long ago but it was worth the trip from East Mesa to Phoenix today. We had the shishito peppers with the umami sauce which paired very well, those peppers were charred to perfection. We ended up trying half the chicken and next time we will get the whole because it's full of so much flavor. We asked our server how it's made and they brine it and use a dry rub to make it and the chickens are free rage so it's not a huge bird like everyone's use to. They let you choice a side and we went for the califlower mash and it was good, the texture threw me off since it's nothing like mashed potatoes. Last we got something completely different and out of our comfort zone. A pizza which had Brussel sprouts, sweet potato, bacon, smoked mozzarella, and pistachios. It was surprisingly tasty, all the toppings blended well and we can't wait to go by and try the rest of their items!"}
{"text":"Within this review, i'll try my best to summarize the good & bad in relation to my 3-out-of-5 star rating... I'll just cut to the chase & say that I finally tried this place after much anticipation (I live in the area)... 

FOOD:

Chicken can be hit-miss depending on how fresh it is/etc, & I guess we came at a good time because the chicken was very moist & flavorful. The Apple & Goat Cheese Salad was AMAZING (as was the mac n cheese & the \"Elvis\" parfait I had for dessert), & although the pizza is different it is tasty. I got the gluten-free crust which did remind me of cardboard, but standard crust tends to leave me bloated these days, so in my case it was a tradeoff. Opinions on the pizza will vary, so i'll say this: Think of the pizza at Doughbird as an option for you to get pizza & chicken at the same spot.. Don't think of it as pizza you'd get at a dedicated \"pizza joint\" because there indeed are FAR better options in the nearby area/abroad & you will likely be disappointed if you come into Doughbird with that mindset/expectation. I wasn't too worried because on my current diet I really can't eat alot of pizza to begin with, so I knew that if I didn't like the pizza i'd still have the chicken at my disposal. 

SERVICE:

While there are DEFINITELY some winners working here (even up near the front), it seems like there is some disorganization amongst some (if not all) of the waiters/waitresses. In addition, some of the waitresses (one of which i'm praying I never have to be served by) are somewhat rude/snobby... Had to wait up front for somewhere close to 30 minutes for a booth, followed by a pretty long wait for our food & it wasn't THAT busy when we arrived... Hopefully all of this will be ironed out in time. Nonetheless, in my eyes, your waiter/waitress is the face of the restaurant, so when they're rude/snobby it can create an absolutely terrible first-impression & possibly cause first-time customers not to return for a second visit. 

PRICING:

I won't recite all of the pricing, but I can say that the salad was $10 & to add some chicken to the salad was an additional $4... What kinda irritated me was the fact that the amount of chicken added was probably less than an ounce... So you're paying $4 to add less than an ounce of chicken meat to your salad... With that being said, i'm definitely not a fan of the portion size of chicken with relation to how much you're paying just to add chicken to your salad. It should AT LEAST be a good 2 ounces of chicken at that price, but $4 is a bit obnoxious for what you're getting & i'm not quite sure who came up with that type of pricing. Across the board the place definitely isn't the cheapest, but when the food quality/portion size is adequate I think most of us are willing to splurge every now & then. The \"powers that be\" at Doughbird should take note of this & adjust accordingly. When people feel like you're quietly overcharging them for certain items, it becomes a turnoff & can slowly drive them away from your restaurant.

THE VERDICT:

Will I be back? Very good chance that I will... But i'll be back expecting a long wait, overcharging for certain menu items/add-ons & a couple rude waitresses. If none of the above improves, I may eventually write the place off completely. But for now, we'll see how the next visit goes."}
{"text":"We were excited to try Doughbird.  Tried to get in once with over an hour wait.  We came back another day.  This time we made reservations.  Were seated on time.  The place has a great decor.  The staff was friendly.  The place was not very busy as we ate around 430pm on a Saturday.  The food took a long time to get out.  This is especially tough as we have two small kids.  When the food came it was all cold.  I think they forgot about us and our food.  We didn't have time to send it back as we had already been there 45 minutes with kids.  I would have to say the roasted chicken and pizza were slightly above average.  I will probably just stick with LGO for this combo.  Doughbird is kind of pricey for what you get as the other reviewers have stated.  I love Sam Fox restaurants, but will stick with our other favorites like North and the Henry."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been planning to try Doughbird since they first opened in late-March of 2017. However, due to the far-out location and consistently average reviews I've given most Fox Concepts, we kept putting it off, before finally deciding to bite the bullet on a Thursday night.

Going in and taking one look around, the restaurant looks and feels pretty much like I expected. I'd describe it as sort of a modern-take on a southern-inspired dining area. It's clean, it's sleek, it's lively, and it reeks of that \"hip-corporate\" vibe that urban crowds seem to be an absolute sucker for. Personally, I find it almost too meticulously perfect, to the point where it feels sterile and somewhat fake - but it seems to work for them, so who am I say otherwise? The place was pretty packed on a Thursday evening, requiring a 15-20-minute wait time. Clearly, they're doing something right.

Initially, we started with their truffle cheese stromboli, which is self-explanatory. Even though I have major issues with using fake truffle oil over legitimate truffle shavings, this was actually a respectable starter - as none of the other options looked too appetizing, in my opinion.

We decided to order one pizza and a half-bird of rotisserie \"free range\" chicken (gotta be sure we get those buzz words in for those millennials, right?). The chicken comes with one-side and one sauce, so we opted for some mac and cheese, along with lemon and roasted garlic sauce, in addition to pineapple teriyaki. For pizza, we chose the pepperoni and burrata, which is your standard pepperoni pizza with a bit of burrata spread throughout. 

The pizza, which I usually judge very harshly, was just okay. Topping quality was fine. The burrata was better than a lot of places we've sampled, but nowhere in the league of some of our more exclusive favorites. Crust was pretty basic, offering a bit of flavor (but not much) and a spongy texture. It's not the charred wood-fired style, but traditionally baked pizza (at least that's what it seems like). I've never considered the pizzas at Fox-owned North Italia to be all that great, so my lack of enthusiasm was to be fully expected. 

Now, the chicken. This is something that they definitely do well. Although rotisserie will never be my preferred way to eat the bird, the meat quality was juicy and full of flavor. Sauce flavors were a bit subjective, so you might have to experiment, but the meat itself was lovely and moist. The best we've had? Not by a long shot, but still done quite well!

The mac and cheese, which uses shells similar to the boxed Velveeta my Mom would make, was kind of lame. It was very dry and rubbery, which I imagine was the result of the mac just sitting around in a pot for far too long. Flavor was okay, but it is probably not something I'd order again.

For dessert, we opted for \"The Elvis.\" These days, pretty much anything that incorporates peanut butter and bananas is named after The King. You're getting a peanut butter and chocolate parfait, with bananas, whipped cream, and bacon sandies. My girlfriend points out that Fox absolutely loves selling deserts that they can pack into a jar and this is no different. She liked it a bit more than I did, just simply because pudding-based desserts have never really been my thing. Nevertheless, quality was fine and it's probably something that a lot of people would enjoy.

Like all Fox restaurants, servers were very friendly and prices were reasonable for the amount of food that you receive.

So, the question is: Would we go back? Possibly one day. While their pizza isn't anything to shout praises about, they do offer very decent quality pollo. So I guess when us \"fried folk\" are in the mood to eat something a bit less heavy, Doughbird is a respectable option.

Recommended to try out."}
{"text":"I ordered to go.  A young girl was very friendly and said she would get a bartender for my order.  After standing at the counter for 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging me a very rude and condescending woman came to the counter.  After rudely asking me if I was picking up for a delivery service I told her I had called an order.  She said it wasn't ready yet.  I explained that I had called 30 minutes before and was told 20 minutes.  She stomped off saying she would check ( sorry to ask you to do your job).  She came back with my food and immediately turned around and walked away.  The food was ok, but rude nasty service.... there are so many new places with friendly staff."}
{"text":"I like the food and ambiance here, don't get me wrong. The chicken is moist and tender, I love the variety of sides (fave is mashed cauliflower), and sauces (although none of the ones I've tried have been that great, I just love dipping sauces). Just went back today for the second time and my husband ordered a pizza. The pizza was yummy! I asked him how he liked it and he said, \"It's good, kind of like Blaze Pizza.\" Which made me realize... why didn't we just go to Blaze and spend half the money? And why didn't we just buy a $5 Costco rotisserie chicken? 
The reason I can't love this place is that it's the most basic American cuisine items of pizza and chicken except at fancy restaurant prices. Half a chicken and side is $17. Yeah it's good chicken but have you tried Costco's chicken?"}
{"text":"As the newest restaurant of the Fox Concepts, Doughbird has a lot of potential. They have really friendly staff and quick service. The environment itself is fantastic too; I loved the vibes and decorations inside the restaurant. 

In terms of food, they lived up to the \"Dough\" portion of the name, but could improve upon the \"Bird\" part. The Barbecue Beef pizza was my favorite item from our lunch. They nailed the consistency of the crust, and the corn and cilantro toppings really finished the pizza. They also balanced the sauces (BBQ, pesto & creamy goat cheese) so nothing was overwhelming. 

I also enjoyed the Pastrami Sandwich, which looked like a torta. The pastrami was thinly sliced and flavorful -- I added some Jamaican Jerk Marmalade to it, which made it even better! 

Finally, the whole chicken was good, but not very consistent. Some pieces were cooked evenly, yet still juicy, but other pieces were still undercooked. Apart from that, they had really zesty sauces to add on top -- I really liked the Jamaican Jerk, but wasn't a fan of the Umami Sauce (it was too citrus-y for me)."}
{"text":"This restaurant is overpriced. We were upset when we saw the menus and had the option of spending $15 or more for one entree. We split a pizza and it was enough for the both of us. I ordered a soda (no coke products) and they charge me $3.50. Not satisfied."}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza in the area!!  The bbq chicken is awesome and everything tastes so fresh.  Our new Sunday spot."}
{"text":"Typical Fox restaurant, right down to where the hostess says \"how is your day going?\" three paces away from the host stand. Fox Restaurants are generally good, rarely great, but with a nice atmosphere and efficient service. 

Doughbird is none of those things. The atmosphere is like a cafeteria. Or maybe a daycare center. During each of my three visits (lunch and dinner, both early and late) there were kids everywhere and messes on the ground. Apparently the Arcadia Mom's Club has decided this is the clubhouse.  That'd be OK with me and I wouldn't fault the restaurant much, aside from the mess, if the prices weren't so out of line with what they're serving and the service you get. Service was once too fast, twice way too slow, and dinner for two with a couple of drinks will easily reach $100. Not the price to pay when it sounds and feels like a school lunch room. The food is ok (but again, not great). Creative woodfired pizzas that don't stand out from the abundance of woodfired pizza places in town.  I will admit the rotisserie produces delicious but expensive chicken and prime rib--$24 for a chicken, and way more than that for the beef.  I'd recommend this place if you're in a group where the kids outnumber the adults and you want some decent food and a drink while not worrying about the racket your kids are making. I'd not recommend this place if you're adults, no kids, looking for a more mature dining experience commensurate with the price."}
{"text":"Sam Fox knocks it out of the park yet again! Watching this building as it was being built intrigued me because it was clearly being constructed with quality materials. The windows are big and beautifully made. The exposed beams and wood high ceiling add to the ambiance. There is a patio visible from the street, so people driving by know this is a place to go!  We shared the Brussell sprout pizza and loved it."}
{"text":"I thought the food was great, but it was way too expensive. I paid $25 for my gluten free pizza, drink and tip and it was just as good as my $12 at Fired Pie! The atmosphere is better however. It is a sit down restaurant with great service. I would give it 4 stars,  but I am more a fan of saving money so I'll just give it a three."}
{"text":"Meh. Kind of looks like an upscale IHOP dining area, and the pizza is just so-so....nothing to go back for. We didn't try the chicken because we decided to share a pizza instead, and sadly we won't be going back to try it because of the quality of the pizza, barely chilled prosecco, etc."}
{"text":"Average menu, overpriced for chicken and pizza. I love the Fox concepts but this one is not the best. I gave 3 stars because the service was good."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of coming to Doughbird on opening night, and I must say that I am happy to welcome it with open arms to the neighborhood!  The food was great, the service was spot on, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting.  

For food, we decided to go with the rotisserie plate instead of the pizza, and I am so glad we did!  The skin on the bird was crispy and the meat was juicy, but the star was 100% the side sauce.  We ordered the jalapeno pesto, and oh my lord.....I would bathe in that stuff if it wasn't frowned upon.  The jalapeno pesto was fresh, bright and had just the right amount of spice to it.  We asked out waitress if they would sell us a jar of it, and unfortunately she couldn't, but if they ever start bottling that stuff I'm picking up a few and putting it on everything.  Seriously, get that sauce...it's amazing!

And the atmosphere is what you've come to love about Fox restaurants.  It's comfortable yet hip, and not stuffy in the least so everyone can feel comfortable to come dine here. Definitely a great place for a dinner out with friends, or a casual date night.

All in all I am psyched to have Doughbird to add to my restaurant rotation, and cannot wait to go back and dine again!"}
{"text":"Food was good (3 stars) but takeout experience was terrible and probably the worst organized I have seen. Called on a Thursday around 5pm and was told 20-25 min. We gave them more than  25 and when we came in the order was not even put in yet. Took over an hour and not sure why we even waited. They had one girl taking takeout orders on the phone, walk in orders,  ringing them up, and bagging the food.......yet they had three hostesses standing around  and telling the one girl she has to go orders on the phone. Manager not apologetic at all and lacks customer service skills. We won't be back and the others who had the same experience that night (which I talked to 3 others) will not be back either.  Very disappointing!!"}
{"text":"Really bad food and highly over priced. Didn't try the pizza but had a BBQ chicken sandwich that was unpleasant and other guests had pastrami sandwich and some other sandwich that wasn't memorable.   The cauliflower appetizer was ok, best thing about it was the pesto side sauce.   Also upon entering It took a few minutes for one the 4 girls standing there to address us which felt uncomfortable.   First and last time we'll try this fox concept.   horrible parking for the plaza as well.   This one may have too many strikes against them to sustain"}
{"text":"First time in it was awesome great pizza love the pepperoni and got the Caesar salad with chicken"}
{"text":"We are big fans!  Picky kids loved their pizzas. Hubby and I had the pastrami. Everything was fresh and quick. I tried not to eat all my carbs but I. Just. Couldn't. Stop. It was sooooooo yummy!
Everyone was very friendly. Loved the open concept and decor. Bathrooms were very clean. We will definitely go back even though we came from the opposite end of the world (far west valley)."}
{"text":"I've had the chicken, the stromboli, the hummus, the pizza. I think I've been enough to review.  Sounds odd, but my favorite thing here is the Lebanese hummus. I've been ALL over the Middle East and I'm picky as hell about hummus. And yes, there is a difference between Lebanese and israeli hummus (and they both will say theirs is the best).  ;)     Their hummus is the sh*%.   Creamy, fresh and CLEARLY made with fresh garbonzo beans rather than canned.  I noted the sumac on the bread as well. I just wish we could get more veggies to dip with, I always have to ask for more; which they accommodate.

The chicken is amazing and if you ask , they will remove from the bone.  I have loved both the mashed cauli and the brussell sprouts sides.    The chicken is fresh, tender and oh so juicy.

The truffle stromboli?  OMG  this is actually a perfect size for one person.  Think calzone with truffle cheese!!  If you're really hungry or split with someone, get the pizza. I recently had the BBQ chicken and it was amazing.  If you don't like cilantro (which I love), then you need to note that you shoujld ask for that OFF.  

It's always packed so call ahead or hope for a spot at the bar. Once it cools off, the patio will offer more seating space."}
{"text":"Awesome! Chicken, pizza, drinks and dessert all amazing! Along with the great food, atmosphere was great and staff was very helpful and friendly! Will definitely be back to Dough Bird along with the other Fox restaurants!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Portions of the protein were a little small.  Chicken was good.  Kids loved the pizzas. A little overpriced for portions."}
{"text":"Had the Prime Rib Dip, an ok sandwich, but charging $17.00 is crazy.  It's an $8.00 sandwich. Don't order it. Not enough prime rib and what's on sandwich is skimpy amount.   I have had the chicken too.  It doesn't stand out.  So far typical Fox Concept.  Great atmosphere, cool design, menu \"seems\" inspiring but end product is average."}
{"text":"I loved my meal all the sauces I ordered was fresh and add full flavor to my moist chicken even though I enjoyed the chicken on its own too.  
It was so nice that our server was very helpful in our choices to the menu."}
{"text":"Tried this nearby restaurant and it has a very nice atmosphere. The pizza was very good. The aviator has great pepperoni and bacon. The rotisserie chicken is a strange concept for a restaurant when you can get great (and cheap) roasted chicken at Costco and really any grocery store. We had the half chicken for $17. Just seemed like a waste of $$$ so I'd suggest sticking with pizza or maybe a sandwich at DoughBird."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great peach pie.  Overall the food is good.  Stick to the chicken and the pizza-prime rib is just alright."}
{"text":"So glad this place is finally open! Phoenix was due for another Fox restaurant. The inside is so so adorable, but I wouldn't have expected anything less! Wait time was long but that was also expected. Pro: they do take reservations! Just make sure to do it far enough in advance before they stop taking them (understandable). The service and food was really good too! Very yummy, but ugh a little on the expensive side! I will say though, I would FOR SURE come back and try some of the other things on the menu. The pizzas, salads, and other side choices all look so amazing. For my first visit, my friend and I shared a caesar salad (really really delicious), a full bird, and side of mac and cheese. For a fun occasion or girls night I'd pay the extra money because I know it will be a good experience! See ya soon again Doughbird!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Doughbird and was not disappointed.  Our waiter Ryker was very knowledgeable and helped us to make delicious decisions.  The pizzas are so interesting - we tried the Brussel sprout and 1/2 a chicken... Yum!  The grilled cauliflower side dish was fantastic.  The butterscotch cake was amazing-  again our server had wonderful suggestions and the food followed through! Great food and fantastic service!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful server Brigid. They specialize in pizza so I ordered a Pepperoni Meat combo pizza & my friend ordered a Marguerite pizza. We both agreed- both pizzas were absolutely awful. The crust was hard & like a frozen pizza. We both agreed Pizza Hut is far better & I haven't eaten Pizza Hut in 10 years. Really bad crust, awful toppings. We won't be back. How is this place in business still? Pictured are the leftovers for take-home but thy will not be eaten. If the management is interested in offering pizza, they should dine at the best valley pizzerias then compare it to their product. For starters, check out the crust, sauce & ingredients used at Pizzeria Bianco. I can't teach you anything but your competition can."}
{"text":"We are in town for a quick visit and are TRYING to stay healthy while on vacation. And when I picked Doughbird for dinner I hadn't actually planned on doing that... I was eyeballing that pastrami and goat cheese pizza. But when we got there I did an about-face and went with 1/2 bird, Cali mash, and quinoa tabbouleh. SO FREAKING GOOD. Our waitress Jill was very helpful, knew everything about the menu, and about the other restaurants in the Fox Concept Group. (You guys are nuts if you don't make her a manager!)"}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in Phoenix. We go there at least once a week. Food is very fresh tasty and service is excellent. Probably the best Caesar salad I have had in Phoenix."}
{"text":"So it's down the street from where I work and a few blocks from where I live. My business partner and I love to for lunch.  Food is fantastic!   The servers are great!   Try everything!"}
{"text":"I'll admit, I've passed dough bird dozens of times and have been skeptical. I didn't understand the link between rotisserie chicken and pizza. And the link is just that this is a savory hotspot. The decor and ambience is breathtaking, like what I see in most Sam Fox restaurants. I really just wanted to sit there all day.

I usually don't like bbq pizza. Mainly because my hubby and I order it often since it's easy to get cheeseless (hubby is lactose intolerant). But the jalape√±o pesto on Dough Bird's bbq pizza peaked my interest- and it was worth it. This pizza is covered in fresh herbs, spicy bbq sauce, rotisserie chicken, cheese, and roasted corn. I love the jalape√±o pesto. Can I buy that and put it on everything please? I get the link between pizza and chicken now.

Only downside is I feel like this place is pretty pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"like most of the Fox restaurants - well executed, great food and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is another great Fox Concepts Restaurant. Came in expecting great food and I was not disappointed. We got a Half Chicken and the Crispy Pastrami pizza. The chicken was very moist and seasoned well and the sauce is a great bonus. Can't say enough good things about the pizza. One of the best pizzas I've ever had. From the crispy kale, pastrami, and the garlic butter sauce, I wanted to order another. Only bad thing was the wait and how busy it is."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place out, being a Fox Restaurant and all. I used to work for them and had heard about dough bird. My friend and I ended up placing an order for two pies. One was the mushroom arugula one and the other was their margarita. The pizzas were cold when we got there and they had to warm them back up for us. Not many options of food and no vegan options."}
{"text":"Looking for a great date spot? This place is definitely a worthy choice. Waiting for a table is worth it or better yet grab a spot at the bar (like we did) and you won't be disappointed. We started with the chicken avocado salad and were both very pleased. Order it with light dressing unless you're ranch obsessed like me. I had to take a side of ranch to go it's that good. To accompany our salad we ordered out of the box and went with the crispy pastrami pizza. It was fantastic but not on the healthy side."}
{"text":"Doughbird was the absolute best! The staff were all incredibly friendly, making my last meal in Phoenix one of the best. We ordered the Lebanese Hummus & Tomato and Quinoa salad for appetizers which were fresh & amazing. My one takeaway from the Hummus is that it needed more pita bread. I shared the Bacon & Truffled Eggs Pizza with a friend & it was delicious. For dessert we had the Lemon Meringue Pie, and the marshmallow fluffiness of the meringue so dreamy. I highly recommend Doughbird, it's super friendly, cute n chill & delicious."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place out...I was let down! As an avid rotisserie consumer the bar was set high. Don't get me wrong the half bird was good but, it wasn't amazing, I also got the cauliflower mash (which was really good) but cold! And for the price? Eh. My husband got the chicken Cesar salad and at $14 I thought it would be a decent size position but it was on the smaller side. My daughter got the kids cheese pizza and of course she loved it (you can't really go wrong with pizza). 

Despite the let down of amazing food and pocket grabbing check the restaurant is super cute, no detail was left untouched. I love how you can see your food getting made and the openness is very inviting. My favorite is the tile throughout!"}
{"text":"Pizza- my husband said it best, \"it's no LGO.\"
Wings- eh..just alright
Mac and cheese- pretty good :) but just as good velveta boxed
Caesar Salad with rotisserie-Really good!
Potato wedges-no good
Brussels sprouts and kale side- ick
Service- really good, very friendly
Cream soda-very good
Root beer-tastes like too much carbonation 

Probably won't come back"}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon and our dining experience was less than par. 
This weekend has been filled with trying out new restaurants and Doughbird was on our Sunday night pizza list. 
I ordered the Raven & Geary margarita which was not horrible just not a terrific cocktail. 
The appetizers that followed our drink order left a bad taste in my mouth. The $10 hummus appetizer was EXTREMELY salty and didn't meet standards compared to other major Hummus restaurants I've enjoyed.
The chicken wings were crunchy and warm but it's also EXTREMELY annoying that Fox Co. restaurants nickel and dime anyway possible in adding $1 to every dipping sauce ordered. 
We asked for the wings naked so we could try out the pineapple teriyaki, buffalo, BBQ and jalape√±o pesto. (Womp, womp)
Pizza came out incorrect which our server immediately took back the moment it hit our table but it just added an additional 5 minutes to our time, no biggie but our crust was extra crisp. (?????) 
I wanted to order dessert but realized we were already close to a $70 bill! No thanks.
Doughbird is overly hyped, underwhelming and 25 minutes out of our way. 
Fire&Brimstone was our last 'WOW' pizza and recommend trying them out next time your in the mood for brick oven. 
As for me tonight, I'm sipping ice water to cancel out my sodium toxication."}
{"text":"It was date afternoon with my hubby and we've been waiting to try Dough Birds.  He's a pizza buff and me, I always want to try something new.  We were both happy with his pizza and my prime rib sandwich.  Perfectly orchestrated to delight the culinary senses.  Our wait staff was efficient.  The atmosphere is relaxing.  Good job Sam Fox"}
{"text":"Doughbird was our final food stop on our trip to Phoenix. We arrived around lunch time on a Sunday and were seated at a table in the center of their very spacious and airy dining area. The two large brick ovens can be seen from anywhere in the restaurant.

My wife and I decided to get a salad and a pizza to share. While many options looked enticing, we opted for the Garden Chop Salad and the Barbecue Chicken Pizza.

I have had Barbecue Chicken Pizza at many places, but this was easily the most creative and best tasting one I've ever had. I loved that they utilized the tender, juicy rotisserie chicken on the pizza. The sauce was piquant, smoky, and complex. The crust was cooked perfectly. I was sad when the last slice was gone.

The Chop Salad did its best to not be considered an afterthought to this amazing meal. The wide array of ingredients complemented each other surprisingly well. My favorite parts of the salad were the brussels sprouts and the heirloom carrots. 

Even though there are many pizza restaurants in the Phoenix area, if we come back to Phoenix we will definitely make sure to visit Doughbird again."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner.  Atmosphere and decor was great when we walked in.  We were greeted immediately and service was good.  Menu was very simple so we ordered a little bit of everything.  Ordered the Spiral Ham and Bacon & Truffled Eggs pizza.  Both were great but wished the crust was a little bit more to my tasting.  Ordered the whole bird with the jalape√±o pesto sauce.  That was good as well but I must say it was slightly overpriced.  The mac and cheese and potato wedges were just average and nothing special.  Overally, fun place to hang out and grab a couple pizzas."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend to treat her to a birthday dinner. I was excited when I read they had a mushroom pizza because I love mushrooms and love a pizza that is simple. This pizza was a solid 7/10. I do wish there was a little bit of sauce, even if it was a tad bit of white sauce, because the truffle oil became a little too much at one point. Also wish the crush was thicker because it was so weighted down by the toppings, even if the toppings were only mushroom.
My friend got the barbeque chicken pizza and we were really surprised when we bit into it and it was spicy. I guess I don't think of a BBQ chicken pizza as spicy (because BBQ sauce is sweet and tangy...?), but to each his own. Also the pizza was very hard to hold. Again, the crust being thin and all you can't really expect anything different from it. 
We also got the guacamole, which was awesome! I would never get it again solely because it was $10, but it was sure yummy. One thing I was SO confused about though was the random orange chunks in it? WHO PUTS ORANGES IN GUACAMOLE???? Like I get it but I don't get it. It was one of those things that you're like \"Okay I like this but I actually don't know if I like this\". The chips they made, which you could clearly tell were made in house, were SO GOOD though. 
Overall, I liked this place. It would probably rank 3.5 stars with me but it wasn't bad enough to give 3 stars."}
{"text":"Really great pizza!!! Must try the Brussels sprouts pizza. Sounds weird but it's amazing!! Great service and location!"}
{"text":"This place oozes in trendy charm. The atmosphere and staff are friendly and inviting. This restaurant specializes in both pizza dough and chicken. I have yet to try the chicken, so cannot provide a review of that... Yet... But I am sure I will be back. The pizza was delicious and the pizza crust exceptional. Who would have thought brussel sprouts would be good on pizza? Well, they were not only good, but I would rate as excellent. I had the apple and goat cheese salad and sampled both the brussel sprout pizza and aviator pizza. The aviator is simply the meat lovers pizza and I would rate as good. The brussel sprout pizza has roasted brussel sprouts, melted sweet potato, glazed bacon, smoked mozzarella, pistachio. Would recommend and will certainly return."}
{"text":"I loved my experience at Doughbird!! My husband and I went for an early dinner on a Wednesday evening and were sat right away. My husband had the Bourbon & Bells cocktail and I had the Local. Both delicious!

We ordered the Bacon & Truffled Egg Pizza and the Half Bird with Chipotle BBQ Sauce and Spicy Buffalo Sauce with a side of mac and cheese. It was all delicious! We split the entire meal and had 2 slices of pizza to take home. 

Friendly staff and great food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our first meal at Doughbird on the 4th of July.  My family instantly liked the ambiance while waiting for our table.  We had reservations, so the wait was minimal.  For starter, we had shishito pepper and chicken wings.  Both were delicious! The sauce on the chicken wings are very special and was not too hot.  We had two pizzas, Margarita and Bacon & Eggs, followed with a whole rotisserie chicken.  Pizzas were very very good and the chicken was tender and juicy!  Every item was great!  Then we topped the dinner off with Butter Cake and Peach cobbler.  Sorry to say that we will not order the peach cobbler again.  

I must also mention that the service was wonderful! 

However, we will definitely come back to Doughbird soon.  Fox Restaurants offer many different style of foods, several are not our favorite, but Doughbird is definitely on top of our list!  I did not use their rest rooms, if they have gender neutral restrooms, then I will not return."}
{"text":"We've been dying to try this place and couldn't pass it up when Fox Restaurants sent me a 25% off email for the Fourth of July. As I presumed, it was packed! I recommend making a reservation, they do have open seating at the bar which we were lucky enough to snag two seats as soon as we arrived. 

I did some research before to see what others have tried, so we decided to go with the hummus as an appetizer and it was delicious! The pita it comes with was cooked perfectly and the hummus has great flavor, was fresh and extra creamy. For our main dish we split the Margherita pizza...amazing! The crust is thin, but not super crunchy and their sauce has a little bit of sweetness to it.

The service was a little slow, it took a few minutes for someone to come say hello and get our drink order. If you sit at the bar you get to watch the magic happen (the making of pizza). Overall, the atmosphere and food were great. We can't wait to go back and try out other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"This is the type of restaurant where the manager (Antonia) greets you at the door and immediately treats you like family. Then, the servers (Michael, Amy, etc) are friendly and attentive and you can tell that they are foodies who love their job. Finally, the food is excellent.  The pizza dough really is the best.  And, the salads are great."}
{"text":"We have driven by many times but I was a little hesitant to try Doughbird.. Honestly, how much can you really do with rotisserie chicken? 

We went on my boyfriend's birthday since we were staying in a hotel that was only ten minutes away. We were seated immediately and were handed menus. I noticed that the menu was fairly small- apps, salads, pizzas and rotisserie.. but there was so much variety!

They offer pizzas for any palette. Their rotisserie chicken comes in half or full and comes with a side and a sauce. There were at least eight sides and about ten sauces to choose from! I am so indecisive; it took me a while to get it all figured out but our server was so understanding. 

I settled for the half rotisserie chicken with teriyaki pineapple sauce and a side of Mac and cheese. Their chicken was moist and tender unlike your local grocer's. Their Mac was awesome! My BF ordered the Spiral Ham pizza which was also amazing. They have a chili oil on the table that goes great with their pizza and chicken. I expected the portions to be small but surprisingly they were a good size. 

I asked our server if they did anything for birthdays and he informed me that they unfortunately did not. But toward the end while we were waiting for our check, the brought out a dessert to surprise my bf and I was so so grateful. Thanks for the awesome service. 

This restaurant is definitely on the more pricey side (as are all Fox concept restaurants) but we left sooo satisfied it was definitely worth every penny. Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"This place is a great place for family, friends, social gatherings, and delicious food! If you sit at the bar you can gaze into the kitchen, lots of in door and outdoor seating available, and you can reserve a space on open table. If Pizza is not your thing there are lots of other options on the menu: Salads, Chicken dishes, and healthy sides. I highly recommend the hot wing appetizer as these are the best wings I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Fox restaurants since they opened their first SAUCE in Tucson 12 years ago or so. Don't love Zinburger, Blanco, or North much... Their menus don't do much for me. But Doughbird is different. Simple menu, traditional pizzas and rotisserie items. Excellent ambience, bested only by the Henry in the Fox  Family... Wait times are understandable for such a new restay, service is good. But the FOOD... Oh my good Lord, the food... Pizza has excellent blend of savory tomato sauce, perfect? melted and gooey cheeses and properly proportioned meats. I've tried three pizzas now and I couldn't pick a favorite. They were top notch pizzas, some of my favorites in the valley. Mac and cheese and shishito peppers rounded out the meal nicely. Both being excellent versions of dishes I've had many times. 

One final note... Umami sauce. Get it"}
{"text":"I wanted to like the place more but the food was just Ok. I'm a pizza lover and I would have it every day if I could. We drove by this place and it was cute, had a nice vibe and so we gave it a shot. I stick to the basics and got a cheese. It was average. Others in the group got some of the specials and gluten free offerings. They seemed happier with their selections."}
{"text":"Went with the Beau for date night. 20min wait to sit even tho we could see tables available. Ordered a salad to split, wings as an app, pizza for me ,half a bird for the Beau and a side of mac and cheese because I've been wanting a really good mac and cheese but can't seem to find one....they were nice enough to separately plate the salad for us but the wings showed up before it. Waited about half an hour before they finally said something about burning the pizza so they left us kinda staring into space wondering what was taking so long with the food and watching people that arrived after us leave. They brought out the chicken and explained but a new pizza followed right behind so I'm thinking they just avoided us til they had food to set down. Manager was super nice and whole meal was comped without us complaining or even asking which was nice and appreciated but I would have much rather just heard what was going on as a courtesy. Beau said chicken tasted like chicken, was nothing spectacular and he wouldnt be back which I guess sucks for me if I want to try something else on the menu. Mac and cheese reminded me of Velveeta stuff and the pizza was decent. If I go back it will be for salad, wings and something new to go because even tho I liked the overall decor it was super loud....like at a club or bar loud and we couldn't hear each other that well so that's why we weren't talking much and staring off looking for food. Which is by no means the staffs fault but it's just not something I was expecting with my dinner."}
{"text":"I just want to give a shoutout to Justin, love your ink bro, you gave us exceptional service today and were especially adept at dealing with my typically ornery grandfather. Thanks for everything"}
{"text":"This restaurant was hands down, the best place I've eaten in forever. Our server Arinn was the best, and finding out it was her first day solo off training, well done. 
The food was incredible   We were there as they opened and within an hour the place was packed. This didn't interfere with the service either. I highly recommend this place.  A bonus , it was my birthday and was treated to an incredible dessert as well. 
I will return again and for sure will ask to sit in Arinn's section. Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"So my first experience at Doughbird was during their opening week and left much to be desired. However, I later talked with the manager (he couldn't have been more attentive and wonderful) who assured me that my next visit would be different, and to please try them again to restore my confidence and palate in Doughbird and Fox restaurants. 

Tonight we went back and our experience was fantastic! We were greeted warmly and seated at a comfortable booth in the middle of the restaurant. Soon thereafter our waiter arrived, got us drinks, and took our orders. We had cesar salads, bread and butter, salmon, chicken with jalape√±o pesto and potato wedges, brussel sprouts and kale, and the prime rib dip sandwich with potato wedges. Every single thing we ordered was flawless! The chicken was tender, moist, and full of flavor, the salmon was cooked beautifully, and the prime rib sandwich melted in my mouth; absolutely delicious! This was my first introduction to jalape√±o pesto, but now I am quite sure my life has been forever changed because of it! It was a complete turnaround from our previous visit. 

My only knock is that the food comes out pretty slowly, so hopefully you enjoy the company you are with. They just opened however, so maybe this will improve with time. 

Thanks to the wonderful management and the incredible food I will be back many times to come!"}
{"text":"We live in Arcadia and with the frequency of new restaurants opening in the area, I believe we had appropriate expectations going into this new FRC. Dropped in on a Sunday evening around 5. Parking was open in the shopping center at this time of day but valet is available as well. Wait for a table was 40 min but there was space available at the bar for two. There appeared to be a lot of servers on shift and they seem to rotate customers based on workload, which is fine and we had no delays at the bar. 

The cocktails were very good. I had The Local and my boyfriend had the Gin/Tonic #22. We ordered the half bird and quinoa/tabouleh side with Greek yogurt sauce and Brussel sprout pizza. 

Much like other FRC the experience and food is good, not great."}
{"text":"The best thin crust dough I have had in Phoenix was at Doughbird. My vegetarian friend and I grabbed dinner here after a nearby Elite event. We ordered the Grilled Brussel Sprout pizza with the bacon on the side and sweet corn. The pizza was spectacular but what really stood out to me was the flavor and texture of the dough. Super flavorful dough, crisp on the bottom and chewy on top, but not soggy.

She took the leftovers home to her husband who also commented on the quality. I can't wait to comeback to try another pizza, probably the wild mushroom!"}
{"text":"Came here twice and I have to say that it is such a lovely spot for lunch or dinner. What I like the most is probably the decor. Its spacious and well lit and has this nice but casual feel to it (if that makes any sense). Came here with one of my friend who is hmm a \"picky eater\" and she even really liked this place. The pizzas and the salads are delicious. The pizza size is great for one person who is hungry or enough to share with a salad or appetizer. One of my friend had the watermelon cocktail and it's the perfect summer drink: lightly sweetened and refreshing. 
Have not tried their roast chicken yet but will come back for more."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered the Bacon & Truffled egg and the Barbecue Beef. Eggs on a pizza?! Sounds weird right? Surprisingly, it was really good. I actually liked it better than the barbecue beef. 

The Bacon & Truffled Egg pizza is more of a breakfast pizza, but I'm the type of person to eat breakfast for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. So if you don't have any issues with that, then this is for you. The crust is really cripsy and warm and the arugula complemented the pizza well.

The sauce was really good on the barbecue chicken pizza and the pesto sauce on it complemented the beef very well. The corn, red onions, and goat cheese was a great addition to the pizza. 

Overall, the pizza is very flavorful, but it is not my favorite type crust. 

The drinks are okay. I got the local and it tasted like watered down vodka. My boyfriend got the raven & Geary margarita. It was strong and delicious. You could taste the three tequilas that were infused.

Note: They also have a great rewards system for birthdays or if you sign up with your emails for specials."}
{"text":"Over all the food was great but would have been nice to get our appetizer before the meal not when we were already eating our main course. Will be back but will wait 10 or 15 before ordering our main dish."}
{"text":"We saw this place passing by to go to the Henry few weeks ago.. my boyfriend and I both ordered the half rotisserie chicken with corn and Mac and cheese as our side.. the sauces we chose were pineapple teriyaki, Jamaican jerk, jalape√±o pesto and horseradish.. all the sauces we chose were pretty good but we both like the teriyaki and the pesto the best.. we would defin be back to try out their pizza along with the other sides and sauces they have to offer.."}
{"text":"Second time since they have opened and is always great. The rotisserie chicken and pepperoni and burrata pizza are can't miss. Next time we will have to start with dessert cause we are always to full when the time comes."}
{"text":"We were super excited about the newest FRC restaurant but our experience left much to be desired. The one star is for the chicken soup we had to start which was AMAZING but then the pizza (pepperoni & burrata) and  whole chicken (with corn, mac & cheese, and potato pur√©e) took a long while to arrive and was barely warm to the touch when it did come. Additionally, we did not receive all the chicken pieces we should have received with a whole bird - our tray was short a breast piece, which is my favorite so when my husband ate the only one I was devastated!! We were so hungry we did not immediately say anything to the waitress but as we continued to eat and our food went from barely warm to down right cold in a matter of minutes we had to say something! The manager came over and listened to what we had to say and comped us a dessert but offered no remedy to the fact we were shy chicken we had ordered in the whole bird tray. We were disappointed with the food, the service, and the value for money mostly because we spent over $80 for two people to eat mediocre food...  We love other FRC places and are frequent customers but don't think we will be returning to Doughbird anytime soon! Really disappointed and let down!!!"}
{"text":"Doubhbird totally lived up to my expectations. We ordered the pepperoni pizza - which was light and fantastic. I didn't feel like my stomach was on fire after eating it, which is so nice! We also ordered the entire bird with a side of buffalo sauce. WOW. This is seriously mouth watering good. We also got a side of Brussels Sprouts and Kale but they were freezing cold? Not sure if it was suppose to be like this or not but I would try something different next time. This place is totally worth trying and I look forward to having it again."}
{"text":"Awesome! I've eaten here twice and I love everything about this Foxx Concepts restaurant. The decor is really interesting, the staff are happy and we'll trained as usual, and the pizza was AMAZING!  Foxx comes through again!"}
{"text":"My son and I love this place! We always get the rotisserie chicken with teriyaki dipping sauce and the hummus. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here for my nana's birthday lunch and it was disappointing!! 

The inside is beautiful and very spacious! Big windows, beautiful curtains, wooden tables with comfortable chairs or booths, gray and blue tones all around, with accents of wine bottles and wine holders. It was comfortable and classy! 

The menu doesn't leave a whole lot of description for simplistic items such as the ranch chicken salad sandwich, which is something my nana was interested in. When we asked the server she explained that it was shredded chicken, tossed in a ranch dip with bacon, avocado, fontina cheese on a ciabatta bread, served with a choice of fries or coleslaw. Sounded delicious! My aunt and Mom ordered the special of rosemary rotisserie chicken with stuffing, Brussels sprouts and kale while also splitting the prim rib dip sandwich. I too got the prim rib dip sandwich! 

The chicken salad sandwich was not shredded it was almost a full chicken breast with random chunks seperated into the salad mix and the bread was too hard, possibly even stale for my nana to eat. She also got the coleslaw which really wasn't coleslaw but rather a small side salad with chunks of cabbage and a sweet dressing. 

As for The rotisserie dressing was really dry as well as the stuffing, and the Brussel sprouts were very few. 

I will say that the prime rib dip was delicious which is the only thing that saves them 1 Star. 

For being as classy and high priced as this place was you would expect there to be better quality of food. It's not a place I would come back to or recommend."}
{"text":"Just what the neighborhood needed!! This is a fun place for any social occasion: a date, dining with friends,family dinner or a fun, casual celebration. I've enjoyed the pizza, salads, sandwiches, sides and desserts. The Staff are friendly. The parking is glitchy/limited, so be prepared to take advantage of the complimentary valet. Also, Open Table or other resrvations are a must. Fox Concept Restaurants got it just right with this one. However, it's a little loud. The patios are fab when the weather cools off, but too warm in \"summer\".  Check out the menu and I am sure you'll find something you like!! I think even the pickiest eaters will like this menu!!"}
{"text":"I keep calling this spot Dough Boy... you remover Ice Cube from Boyz n the Hood!!! Ok, cracking jokes isn't my strong suit, but I will say this place was all the buzz on a Saturday night. The wait was 30-45 mins but we managed to grab a spot at the bar... don't be afraid to ask people to slide down a seat to make room as it happen 3 or 4 times to everyone sitting around the wrap-up bar that night. 

Walking by other tables I caught a glimpse of some of the delicious items... the pepperoni & variety of pizzas reminded me of my trip to Italy... fresh ingredients & 'delectable' pizzas!! 

Started off with the Apple & Goat Cheese Salad, Raven & Geary Margarita, Pepperoni & Mozz Pizza and a few Moscow Mules. We decided to split the Salad and the best thing is that they know that's the plan so they will literally split it for you into 2 plates. That way you get a nice balance. Our seats at the bar gave us a 1st hand look at the work that went into making the salads, sandwiches and more. 

The salad was fresh, light, yet filling and a good starter as we waited on the pizza. That part... you know the waiting... took a long time... When it did come, it lived up to the expectation... flavor, dough, sauce and ingredients were all good. Did I want another pizza... yeah (just being greedy at that point, but honestly I wasn't willing to wait that long again. 

looking forward to returning. WOuld suggest not bringing the kids as the vibe is more catered to adults... which was a welcomed change up!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on recommendation of one of my coworkers and honestly this place is so nice. Our server Hunter was super great. We had some of their cocktails where were superb! I am not  a huge fan of liquor drinks but I would recommend these. We also got the hummus which was very good. I really wanted to  say thank  you to Hunter and the manger that was there for being so accommodating when we didn't 100% love what we ordered. We tried to just get a box and take it, but not only did the waiter ask if we're wanted something else, but his  boss insisted and had our pizza remade and it was amazing! Generally I don't have a problem requesting something be fixed, but the pizza was not made poorly in the first place, we just didn't know the bbq pizza would be so sweet. But it is one of there most popular pizzas so we decided to go for it. So this has got quite lengthy; YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME"}
{"text":"Bright atmosphere and clean. Was far better than expected. Service was fast and helpful. Would gladly eat here again. Had a margarita pizza. Appears to be fired in brick oven."}
{"text":"Went here with my mom for a quick lunch. The caramelized cauliflower with the coleslaw and the Umami sauce was to die for! The simple Cesar with chicken was perfect, had the right amount of dressing. Will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.  I would give it more than 5 stars if I could.  It was REALLY good!  Two of us shared the Barbecue chicken pizza and Buffalo chicken wings.  There was enough left over for a 3rd person.  My only criticism would be that it was a little pricey.  Maybe rate it $$$ and not $$.  $44.53 for lunch for two people and we drank lemonade.  Oh, but we did share a dessert.  The lemon meringue pie was sooo delicious!"}
{"text":"I had the aviator on a gluten free crust which was mediocre and not sure worth dealing with the negative hostile environment that the staff conducted in. I had a seat at the bar and some of the female servers were gossiping about another female server and one said, \"I hope she gets a flat tire on the way home.\"  She then proceeded to complain to the male servers at the serving bar about the other girl and what to appear as the manager never stopped the gossip nor banter. After coming here for my first time, I don't recommend this place because the quality is not of high importance, but the bantering and negativity seemed to be the highlight of the night. Sad to say I had to see the employees conduct in this manner in front of customers with no regard."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza!  We ordered the Truffled Egg and Bacon pizza and the Pepperoni (the most familiar to a \"regular\" pizza) and both were really good!  Never thought I would like scrambled eggs on a pizza...  They make their own chili oil to put on the pizza which was also really good.  We tried the chili pepper appetizer which was roasted peppers and 1 out of 10 were supposed to be spicy, but we never did get one.  They come with a sauce to dip in.  I'd recommend an Open Table reservation if you're planning on trying this anytime soon, people that came in to wait on a table were waiting quite awhile.  They also have bar seating if you want to walk in and sit there.  Worth a try!!"}
{"text":"Everything was so great from the moment we walked in, until the moment we left. We came on a not so busy Saturday around 4pm in which they were running happy hour so we sat at a high top. We only ordered the wings off the happy hour menu, they were pretty tasty just wish they were fresh. I know it's hard to not prebake or fry wings because it takes longer to make but they just taste so much better. We shared the chicken avocado salad which was AMAZING. I have been craving it since. Between the bacon, the chicken, the avocado there was enough of everything (and a very generous portion). We got the pepperoni and fresh Moz pizza which we also enjoyed. We were so full but just kept eating and eating it was just that great. We will definitely be back to try more of the menu items. Since you can see the whole back counter we did notice some other things weren't fresh. For instance the prime rib dip looked great but it was previously frozen so once again, just misses that freshness taste. We have been to many fox restaurants and haven't noticed that so maybe it's just this one."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and service. Kim was awesome and well versed with the menu, Kolin made great recommendations with the menu, and we loved everything we had. Artichoke Pizza was the best!"}
{"text":"Not a very good place to go eat.  Service was horrible. We came in party of four. First waitress took out drink and food order, then 10 minutes later change to a different waitress.  Our salads came out. Ok nothing great simple Caesar  salad.  Then we wait for more than 30 min for a pie and a chicken sandwich.  Which the 2nd waitress wasn't aware of our dinner order, thinking we only had the salads for dinner.  No one apologize management never came over to say anything.  Food mediocre service need a bit more training.  Won't be returning back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The food is great and the staff is very nice. Its just a fun dining experience! Another Sam Fox success!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! We had a bottle of great malbec and then split a great cesear salad and had the whole chicken with the jalepeno pesto... Delicious...We will be back... Fantast service as well!!!"}
{"text":"Downfall is that this place gets busy! So I would definitely recommend making a reservation ahead of time!! But it was worth the wait, so DO IT!

The Local drink is DELICIOUS and is a fabulous, refreshing summer drink!! For food we ordered the cheesy, truffle bread appetizer. The dough was delicious and it was the perfect amount of cheesy goodness-- I only wish there was more. For my entree I ordered the half bird with lemon garlic sauce & a side caesar salad. Obviously they dont mess around with their rotisserie chicken and the sauce to go with was yummy! The salad was cool, but nothing out of the ordinary.

Service was good, good vibes, nice atmosphere! Ill definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Avocado chicken salad was AMAZING. The perfect salad in terms of ingredients and flavors. Wish there was a little more chicken though. 
Pizzas (we tried a traditional pepperoni and one loaded with meat toppings) were tasty, albeit a little overdone for our taste. 
Overall a good experience and good service. Our wings were delayed but the manager did a great job in making it up to us. Plus they ended up tasting bomb and the dipping sauce was amazing too. 
We definitely will come back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place since I first saw the sign during construction. Finally got around to checking it out this past weekend and was not disappointed. It was steadily busy for the hour or so I was there but we were seated immediately and our server was excellent. She never let the glasses run empty and any dirty plates/silverware were cleaned away quickly. Tried the shishito peppers, caesar salad, roasted chicken and pepperoni and burrata pizza. Everything was really good. The chicken in particular had a very good flavor and I would go back for that alone. Also tried a couple of their desserts and they were also definitely worth checking out. Very nice place and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is a great example of why Sam Fox is so successful. Just a cool concept that won't leave you disappointed. The chickens are good quality and prepared well. Delightfully not over-salty. The sides and sauces offer a range of choices. My negatives are first the noisiness; sounds seem sharpened as they bounce around the room. Second, the priciness; this is primarily a family type place, but much to expensive to bring the kids. I liked the cleanliness and quality of service. I certainly suggest you try this place."}
{"text":"Nice place to go for a quiet meal for two. We usually get a pizza and a salad to share."}
{"text":"My husband and I made reservations on a Friday night for dinner and we were happy we did because it was very busy. We ordered a beer, margarita, Stromboli and we both ordered a half rotisserie chicken. The bill came up to $85 with tip. Our meal was good, but we will be revisiting other restaurants before this one for sure. First of all, we thought the service was spot on and the staff was very attentive. We decided not to try the pizza because we already have some favorite pizza spots in the area. Our Stromboli was good, but it was missing something. We requested marinara sauce on the side and we were thankful we did. I personally think it needs thin slice of meat like salami to give it more flavor. We got a little adventurous with the side of 5 sauces for the rotisserie chicken. Our favorite was the jerk sauce and the buffalo sauce. Our least favorite was the jalape√±o pesto.  The chicken was good, but I didn't think it was anything spectacular. Overall, I'd rather go back to Sam Fox's other restaurant, The Henry."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant! The service was outstanding! My friend and I unknowingly showed up 20 minutes before they closed and we were immediately greeted with a smile and sat to a booth. Our server was extremely attentive, friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. We got the shishito peppers and the pizza with bacon and egg which tasted great at the time but we both woke up feeling nauseous... would definitely give it another try based on the service alone!"}
{"text":"The newest Fox Concept restaurant did not disappoint! The interior and atmosphere was grade \"A\" as all of his restaurants are. No detail overlooked, the place to sit and have a bit but also feel like your sitting at the cool kids lunch table. No bad seat in the restaurant, the patio looked great but a mid afternoon visit in June does not permit the use of the patio. 

Overall the food was good. We ordered a few items so we could basically have a taste of all parts of the menu. The restaurant boast their pizza and rotisserie chicken.  The pizza was okay, the chicken was outstanding. I got a side of the cauliflower mash and kale and Brussel sprouts both were average. Finally we ordered the pulled BBQ chicken sandwich and it was out of this world tasty. The flavors were so well put together and out performed the pizza by leaps and bounds. 
Order the \"local\" cocktail and it was refreshing but lacked a vast amount of flavor. Their beer selection was great. 

Service was good, food took a little longer than I expected to come out for a party of three. Again went on before the dinner rush and after the lunch crowd so expected a bit of quicker food to service. 

Overall good experience and will defiantly be going back to try a few more items that caught my eye."}
{"text":"$165 and we left hungry!

Just left an early dinner at this new Fox Restaurant concept in Arcadia. From the service to the food this needs work. Our family of four ordered 2 pizzas, rotisserie prime rib and the rotisserie \"fish\" which was a river trout from Sweden that looked like Salmon for $27 including a side. 

The cocktail menu was pretty good at $10 each, but the wine list was not great. I started with a Sauvignon Blanc, which was not great. I switched to a red blend for my second glass, but it was not great at $15/glass. 

I'd say this is weak. The restaurant was crowed at 5:30, but I would not waste time or money here again."}
{"text":"Very fun environment and atmosphere.  We loved the decorating.  The restaurant is completely open, which creates some noise, but it's that perfect level that you can still talk.  The food was amazing.  We had to try a pizza and chicken, both are worth getting.  The side mac and cheese is a must.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Loved it. Cool vibe, great service by Conor, great food. Will return many times...I think probably better for lunch than dinner. Great to take home too. Great new concept from fox"}
{"text":"Yayyy another fox restaurant. Love the decor and atmosphere of this place. Literally obsessed over the plants, so airy and clean feel. The bathroom was nice and the rustic sink was super cute. 

The waiter wasn't that friendly. She came to the table three times just because I had to flag her down. 

The Mac and cheese was really good. Creamy and it taste just right. 

Boyfriend had the half bird and fries. He said the seasoning to the chicken was perfect and the skin was the best part. 

Margherita pizza with good. You can't mess up a perfect cheese pizza with basil on top. It was delicious! I asked for the black truffle sauce on the side to dip my pizza in. It taste even better!!!! Don't forget your chili oil and crush peppers."}
{"text":"I recently took my four kiddos to Doughbird while my bride was at a women's event. They were able to work me in on a busy Friday night. There was not a single open spot in the parking lot and I had to park in the \"pick up order\" parking spot but fortunately didn't get a ticket or request to move. The atmosphere in Doughbird is electric! The lighting is nice - too many restaurants are too dark. The space is big and open and I found myself just looking around to take it all in. The staff were all very friendly but not fake. They had old school etch-a-sketches for the kids and they loved them! I'm not even sure if my kids had ever played with one or not. The chicken I got was delicious! You can order different sauces to dip it in and I got three different ones and they were all amazing! The kids got pizzas and enjoyed those. We got deserts and those were just average. If you are really craving desert it should hit the spot, but if you can do without, save your pennies on those. I can't wait to bring my wife back for a date here - seems like the perfect date spot!"}
{"text":"This place is my new addiction. The food is so fresh and delicious! Service is great! On one of our most recent visits had some chicken wings that weren't cooked completely. They rectified their mistake with a nicely cooked order, took them off the bill and made sure that we were happy with the replacement. The Manager even made her way to the table to speak to us! They are definitely about good food and great customer service which is rare these days! This place doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal. Five stars for the food. But the service was sloooow. We were seated on the patio, and I guess the server just forgot we were there. We never got our drinks refilled, and it took an eternity to get our check."}
{"text":"Our first time at Doughbird was a very good dining experience.  The restaurant has the usual professional style of most Sam Fox Restaurants.  The dining room is comfortable and contemporary.  The service staff is young, energetic and well-trained to properly attend to the customer.  Sam Fox Restaurants are great at attaining the highest level of customer service in their hiring and training.  The combination of pizza and rotisserie chicken is a great concept.  A nice approach is to order both items at your table and share them together.  The side dishes are perfect and the salads are fresh, chrispy and delicious.  The desserts are creative and satisfying.  Prices are a bit high - $17 for a half chicken, $15 for a pizza and $8.25 for a IPA draft beer.  With this price structure we won't be back as often as we would like, but we will return again."}
{"text":"I went on a date with my awesome, incredible girlfriend and we got the buffalo wings and the BBQ Chicken Pizza. It did not disappoint - we gained 5 lbs, but I would gain 5 more to eat there again!"}
{"text":"Doughbird has the vibe of a modern farm that's open and welcoming. With amazing drinks, pizza, dessert and service - they give it all."}
{"text":"We went for dinner and the food was so good !!!! We ordered two pizzas a pepperoni & cheese for the kids and the Aviator. The aviator has a good kick of spice in it but think I actually preferred the pepperoni and cheese the crust was crispy yet flakey and lightweight while still making you still feel full the pizzas are on the smaller size is my only complaint. The chicken and salads that came out to other tables looked so good. The service was fabulous very attentive and friendly made great recommendations. They have a good selection for kids menus. The atmosphere is very cute and trendy and I loved the open concept and feel of it's lots of young families. We live over near Kierland and  are hoping that they will get a location  closer to here or even desert ridge so we don't have to drive so far. But for now it's worth the drive"}
{"text":"It is a pretty nice place. Decent prices. The staff is really nice and attentive. I like curry and they have really good curry. Some of their pizzas might be a little bit dry but they are very tasty. The establishment and restrooms are really clean."}
{"text":"Make sure to get a reservation on weekends. 
This place far exceeded my expectations. I was assuming it was going to be another \"high priced/average food in Arcadia\" kind of place but I was blown away. Everything about it was top notch. The service was really fast and friendly, the cocktails were quite good and decently priced, and the food was excellent. If you haven't gone yet or are hesitatnt... stop thinking too much and get over there! If its a weekend, make sure to get a reservation because the wait can be quite long."}
{"text":"Ok so I didn't know what to expect based on the last couple reviews but I am an equal opportunity eater and don't really care if its a chain or who owns the joint, but how the food tastes and if the service is good.  If those two things are excellent, price isn't really a concern, as I don't mind paying for a good experience.  A couple of friends and I ate here last night and the food was excellent, the service was fast and prompt and they even gave my pup a bowl of water.  

The chicken was tender, well seasoned, and the portion was big for the price in my opinion.  You can either get a half chicken or a whole chicken and the half was more than I could finish. I got the Jalapeno Pesto for the sauce and it was really good and had just the right amount of kick.  The side was mashed cauliflower, this is something that is not always done right, but it was done right here, I really enjoyed it and the sauce and side complimented the chicken well.   

We also got a pizza and it was excellent.  The place was packed the entire time we were there, and still had a small wait when we left around 8:30.   They have valet which is a good thing because otherwise the parking is non-existent.  There is not enough parking at this complex period, I am not sure how the other businesses deal with it.  

Great service, great food, gave me a drink to go, DOG FRIENDLY patio.  5 stars... We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I am originally from Portland, and until today, had not been to a restaurant that could rival anything in Portland.

The Doughbird is so far my favorite place in all of Phoenix. The food is obviously fresh. It seems that everything they can make from scratch, they do. The menu is so diverse. The atmosphere is adorable. The service is outstanding. So incredibly impressed. Our waitress was incredibly attentive and kind. I will be back, and I plan to tell everyone I know."}
{"text":"Fox RC does it again. So good. We tried the Brussel sprout pizza with a side of the jalape√±o pesto and the hummus. Both were delicious and will definitely be reordered. We sat at the kitchen bar top area and enjoyed watching all of the other menu choices as they were prepared. Service was attentive per most Fox restaurants. Menu seemed to have a lot to offer to everyone. Definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! Yum!
I expect nothing less from a Fox restaurant. 

Table of three of us and our side pal on a leash under us! Patio is dog friendly which is awesome.

The decor looks really nice. Modern farm house look to it. 

Im a big pizza fanatic so I had to try. I was wondering if it was going to be the same as North or different. North is probably my 2nd favorite pizza in the valley so i was hoping it was similar! It was actually different but still very good. 

My two other guests got the chicken and said it was amazing! 

Cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I went to Doughbird with the husband for his birthday. We made a reservation (which was necessary) and were seated immediately upon arrival. We ordered a pizza and chicken. The chicken was by far the better dish. We ordered a pizza with barbecue beef and some kind of spicy pesto and thought it was ok, but nothing special (and the people at Doughbird must have a greed because I don't see it on their menu anymore). The chicken, however, was awesome. Perfectly cooked and juicy. We ordered two sauces- the pineapple teriyaki and the Jamaican jerk.   Both sauces were awesome! For our side, we ordered the mashed potatoes..... these things are insane. They must be incredibly bad for you because they were the creamiest, most buttery mashed potatoes I've had in a long time.....decadently delicious. I would definitely recommend Doughbird!"}
{"text":"A little birdie told me about Doughbird- and I flew over there to give it a taste.  Daniel was our Server-and what a delight he was!  He offered input on our selections and he was spot on.  My  friend and I split a whole rotisserie chicken with 2 sides, coleslaw and the Caesar, and the Jalapeno Pesto and Umami Sauces.  Chicken was tender and the zippy side sauces added a nice punch.  The coleslaw and salad added a much needed crunchy complement.  We got there as it opened and were seated immediately.  In a matter of minutes the restaurant was hopping.  Our service was nicely paced-and Daniel made our day with his hospitality and charm!  Ask for him- he is something to crow about!"}
{"text":"My initial post was deleted by Yelp, apparently I violated the rules by posting that I was at a special engagement. Went back a second time when it was open to the public and the food was great. Welcoming atmosphere. Polite staff and somewhat trendy. It's nice to see that the Arcadia area is getting some much needed upgrades. The only complaint I have about the experience is the parking situation. At peak hours, there is virtually no parking at all."}
{"text":"Probably would have been a 4 star rating if it wasn't a San Fox restaurant... But, my expectations are deservedly higher.  Lots of anticipation for this concept.  Just feel a little short of those expectations"}
{"text":"We made a rezzy for a Friday night and was surprised that there were tables open since we came around the same time a few moths ago and there was long wait so we went to another restaurant. 
The crowd was a mix of cool kids, young families, cool adult kids with their parents and couples on date night like us. The service wasn't as good as I expected which is a bummer but I understand it was close to close etc. All the workers were nice just not as attentive as we needed. 
The place is nice inside -very open feeling and they have a patio with misters. 
I got fairly dressed up but seen people in tshirts and jean shorts which I thought was too underdressed. I guess whatever you feel like wearing is fine. 
The food was a meh for me as a vegetarian. We ordered the hummus and I got the margherita pizza as my entree. The hummus was good -nothing special in the realm of pita jungle etc and the pizza was ok again nothing special to note. I probably won't be back since the prices were a little high for the food quality I had."}
{"text":"Good food.  A bit pricey.  The very good chicken is more like a very good Cornish hen.  I also really like the design, with lots of windows, but a bit too loud due to too many hard surfaces."}
{"text":"The pizza was very different than other pizzas in a good way and had nice crispy potato wedges. Nice atmosphere and very aesthetically pleasing. Good service"}
{"text":"Cutest restaurant! I absolutely love the decor here. It just feels relaxing and \"homey\". 

We tried the mushroom and pepperoni pizzas, which were both delicious. I got a side of the BBQ chipotle sauce to dip the crust in and that was tasty too."}
{"text":"The menu is short and that means the food is carefully crafted and delicious. The servers were quick with recommendations and they did not lead me astray."}
{"text":"This place takes damn near forever to do anything whether it be seat you, get you drinks, get your order, etc. Took us almost 40 minutes even with a reservation to get a seat. Food wasn't bad but won't go back for the service."}
{"text":"My new favorite gourmet pizza spot! 

This spot is a huge open restaurant with an open kitchen, where you can see the kitchen staff making food. The restaurant had a cute chic bakery feel with amazing tiled floors, the floors are my favorite. 

The staff is so friendly and very helpful. The host greets you with a smile and my waitress was the sweetest ever. 

On to the food.... We ordered the simple Cesar salad with the rotisserie chicken. For a simple salad it was very tasty with just the right amount of Cesar dressing. If you love brussel sprouts you have to try them here! The brussel sprouts are mixed in with a maple syrup. Not too sweet. The best I've ever had! The pizza here is mind blowing! We ordered the Barbeque Chicken pizza. This pizza has a lot going on but all the ingredients ness well. This pizza is a wood fire thin pizza with bbq sauce, rotisserie chicken, corn, cilantro, cheese, and a jalapeno pesto sauce. The jalapeno pesto does give it a spicy kick. So if you don't enjoy pizza this isn't for you. 

The dessert wasn't anything too special.

Over all the experience was great! The prices are too bad if you're sharing. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Beautiful space and delicious food. I ordered the half chicken with Mac and cheese. The chicken was amazing, juicy and well seasoned. Perfection. The mac and cheese was good but a bit salty. 

I also tried the pizza. It was very good but to me, I would come back for the chicken. 

The service was good. The hostesses were not very friendly but otherwise my experience was great. I'll be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Fox does it again..Thought it was a strange name at first but makes sense now. Menu is primarily pizza and rotisserie chicken. A few entree worthy salads one of which I had but the only thing I didn't try was any of the appetizers. Ill bring friends and definitley have the 4 cheese Stromboli. This was a lazy Sunday night dinner but I still wanted to try everything. I had the spiced bourbon cocktail (twice) . They close at 930 but the place was packed at 9. Original plan was grabbing a drink while waiting for a pie but all the food was being prepared on the other side of the bar and I wanted to try everything. Ended up having the apple goat cheese salad. Sipped on my bourbon ancho Reyes combo and had a few slices of the pizzas. Generous portions, the combo could've easily fed two. NIce mixture of crisp apple slices with sliced grape and roasted pecans or almonds. Plenty of non- traditional pizzas to choose from. I had the Asian chicken which was on a bed of cabbage  cilantro and jalape√±o.The sauce wasn't heavy but hit the spot. Just a heads up it was a mixture of dark meat and white meat on the pie. Not shocking but different. The pizza variety and cocktails reminded me of The Parlor but with a twist. I'll try out the rotisserie chicken and some of the sandwiches in the near future. The staff was are all very friendly. The hostess even noticed my card fell across the counter and walked all the way around from the front just to pick it up and put it back the in the glass. William was one of the bartenders that covered diners at the bar and definitley was on top of his game. Both managers on staff for the night paid close attention to dishes as they came out and definitley multi tasked dealing with customers and servers. Good meal money well spent!"}
{"text":"I am soooo glad the place we went to go to originally was closed! We ended up here and Im so happy! We started with the shishito peppers in a miso lemon sauce. Delicious and not spicy. We tried the prime rib dip and a ceaser with the rotisserie chicken. Omg....dressing was fantastic and the chicken was so tender and juicy. The dip had sliced prime rib, carmelized (I think) onions and cheese on a roll with arugula. So..friggin...good. It came with our choice of side and we chose wedge fries. Arinn was our server (got it off the receipt so I think this is how you spell it) and was adorable. She took great care of us and even offered us to put our drinks to go. When its 190 degrees outside, thats a pretty amazing offer. Cant wait to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place and I'm glad I did! We went in a group of four on a Saturday night. We got in right away with our reservation.  This place is a little noisy but it was also very busy.  We shared two pizzas and a whole chicken with maple Brussels sprouts. The food was delicious! The pepperoni was curled up and had burnt ends which I love and I can never find! Brussels sprouts were amazing.  The chicken had a really good flavor and all the sauces we tried were yummy.  The only negative is I wish the skin was crispy on the chicken and at first I thought the price on the chicken was a little high but I still thought it was worth it.  Service was great!"}
{"text":"Lovely; just what the area doesn't need:  more pizza n chicken?! How bout more burgers too!! Over-priced & as frc typical NO pkg & really nothing new or special. '80's looking bldg & menu...update:  one word Gino's...!!!"}
{"text":"This place is different from what I expected. I initially was thinking it would be super fancy but I love the ambiance and my waiter was awesome. The service was pretty great and the pizza was ok. The salad however was AMAZING! I had a Chicken and Avocado salad and to die for. I def will be a frequent just because of the salad."}
{"text":"People seem to rave about this place and I cannot say why. The interior reminds me of an upscale sandwich joint. Service was friendly and helpful. The menu is compact for sure, with a handful of choices for beer, wine, cocktails, and eats. My cocktail was delicious and that's about it. The hummus appetizer was decent, but only one pita for four people? Not nearly enough. The chicken wings weren't bad to start. The roast chicken (which I was greatly looking forward to) was bland and no better than something from Fry's or Safeway. No crisp on the skin at all, and not that moist either. Sauces were a big miss for me as well. The pizza was sold as thin crust and came with about a 2\" crust all around. It was fair. I wouldn't seek this place out sadly... as I actually love the other Fox Concept dining establishments. Kick it up a notch and I'll return."}
{"text":"If you're looking to eat the chicken, don't come here. It's basically a Costco chicken with dipping sauces. Yes, the chicken is free range, but it is not restaurant worthy. Also the whole bird will fill not up one person. I repeat DO NOT split the whole chicken. I had to order a pizza to fill myself up.  If you want to try this place out maybe come at happy hour :)"}
{"text":"I wish they would offer a chicken breast for those of us that do not like dark meat!  

It is cute and the service is great!

The sauces are yummy and the sides are very tasty.  The pepperoni burrata pizza is fabulous.  It is pricey, no happy hour deals here."}
{"text":"Another typical Fox restaurant.  Over priced, subpar food that costs twice what it should, because it is in a sold in a hip, trendy restaurant.  The pizza sauce has the flavor of generic ketchup and the chicken was dry and lacked any flavor whatsoever.  If this sounds good to you, then you will love it."}
{"text":"More like D'oh Bird.  Truly meh.  

Three things I thought you could always count on: death, taxes, and that Sam Fox restaurants openings are perfect.  Well, now maybe just the first two.  

$12 dollar stromboli for an appetizer.  I thought maybe that would be enough to fill me up so I could take most of my pizza home.  

Nope.  5 bites.  It was good, but $12 for bread and cheese, really?  No big deal, because if they make pizza anywhere close to the way North makes it, we're good.  

Nope.  My brussel sprout pizza ($14) was overloaded with greasy cheese and the crust was soggy because of it.  

My daughter's mac and cheese tasted store bought.  The potato wedges were average at best.  The cauliflower side was probably the best thing I had.  My wife said her chicken and rice soup was outstanding, but I sensed she was just trying to cheer me up.  

I had really high hopes for this place, but you can't charge like The Henry and serve food like Panera.  Kitchen was also inexplicably slow at 4:45 on a weekday.  The servers tried their best to placate the customers, but when the food's not ready, they have a tough job on their hands.  

And the ambiance?  Again, like a fancier Panera.  If it was priced like a Panera, it would be the greatest version of Panera ever and it would earn 4 stars here.  

And the tea was lousy.  But I think that's just the same tea all the Fox restaurants have.  I always have to get pop instead."}
{"text":"We have had awesome service and food every time we have frequented this joint. The atmosphere is perfect in every aspect, layout, design, space, noise dampening, etc. Most importantly the service is dialed in, as well as the food and menu, prices are spot on for what you get in this dining experience. This has become a go to for us, so don't hesitate and give it a try, and you might just become a regular."}
{"text":"The burrata caprese pizza is amazing! The sauce was perfect and the only reason why they don't get five stars is because the crust became soggy faster than what I expected for consuming my pizza within 20min."}
{"text":"1st time tonight. Great place. Decor is contemporary and comfortable. Service is excellent and our waiter very helpful discussing menu items. The food was great. Our party had the 1/2 chicken, chicken club sandwich, a pepperoni pizza and a pumpkin and Brussels sprout pizza. Also had a fantastic cheese stromboli appetizer and cocktails. Everything was first rate. Reasonable prices and a place we'll definately return to."}
{"text":"I experienced great service in speed, response, time till food,etc. The food itself was sub par for the cost. I dont mind paying for food if it is a cut above the rest. If I could find the filet mignon made like it was from Circa 1900(closed now) again I think I would pay 200$ and not bat an eye because it was that much better than anything and that includes Capital Grille,which makes a pretty good one if you order it right.

I ordered the prime rib sandwich. It was low on meat, high on onions and if it were sold at Arbys for 4$ I still wouldnt order it. This however was 18$ with some pretty good coleslaw. I dont see how anyone could justify the price for something so mildly ok. I wont be back, but the plus side is that they are fast and have enough staff to get you in and out quickly."}
{"text":"Restaurant has been open for a week and the service by Hunter was impeccable, our waiter was by no means new. One of the better servers I have had in quite some time.

Had the Margherita Pizza, Pastrami Pizza, Prime Rib Dip Sandwich and the Peach Streusel Pie.

The Margherita Pizza was very good according to my daughter and she loved the fresh mozzerella and she is pretty particular about pizza. I ordered the Pastrami Pizza with roasted Kale, it does taste alot better than it sounds. This combination was pretty good and enjoyed each slice. We shared the Prime Rib Dip Sandwich and forgot to tell them to place the horse radish on the side, it was too overwhelming for her, but not bad for me. The meat was plentiful and the au jus was a good temperature.

It was my birthday and I have been wanting to try the restaurant, so when our waiter Hunter found out it was my birthday, he told me to pick a dessert on the house, we chose the Peach Struesel Pie with Ice Cream and I must say you can't go wrong with that choice.

We will definitely be back to try the Prime Rib and Rotisserie. Our server Hunter definitely made this visit attain the 5 stars"}
