{"text":"Concord Cafe is a really nice small venue for local bands, and with a very diverse mix of shows going on at different times of the month, you're likely to find something you like if you keep a close eye on their schedule.  I will admit that many nights I'm just as likely to skip a stop in the CC when I see herds of young goths smoking out front, or if the crowd looks a little more tamborine-bohemian than I feel like mingling with.  But the beauty of it is that it's a place for all kinds of people.

The main bar area is pretty small, although the front windows open up like doors bringing a lovely fresh breeze in the warmer months.  The staff is always friendly and attentive, although they are the first to admit to the somewhat limited choices on the menu.  But if you're looking for a small snack, a cheap beer or a hot coffee, don't be afraid to give the cafe a go.  I've also heard good things about their brunch, although I have never been.

The stage in the rear is in a seperate room which is great for events with cover.  The stage is small but the room is modest for this type of venue.  Bands have enough room at their disposal to spread out a little, and with the cabaret style seating you can fit a reasonable seating of guests comfortably.  I'm pretty sure for more upbeat shows they can also clear the tables and chairs for dance room only.  A fun, intimate venue with little pretension and a lot of heart."}
{"text":"Is this place ever open during the day any more? I recall getting morning coffee and the occasional brunch there just two years ago. The coffee and espresso were superb by 'hood standards and the brunch was decent enough with solid menu of choices.

Now it seems to be only used a music venue and bar for special events and I have to endure the incompetence at Nova Era or the total mediocrity that is saving gigi if I want a coffee in my neighbourhood.

For now I think I'll stick with my bodum until Concord starts being a cafe again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each time I'd have to say the experience rated as 'ok.'

It's been a while since I've been there for breakfast, but I remember it being just alright.  I can't remember specifically what it was about the breakfast that left me unimpressed, but I remember that something about wasn't very good.

The times I've been there for drinks at night have been cool.  It's a nice, tight venue with a great bar staff that is always friendly.  There's isn't any waiter service for drinks at night, but the bar always has a quick turn around.

There's a venue area/dance floor in the back which plays different things depending on the night you're there.  It's always been something different the times I've been there, so if you're looking for something specific, call ahead and find out what's going on."}
{"text":"The place is nice and the staff are friendly -- though a bit frazzled. The food looked quite good, though I didn't try any on this visit. (The people I was with all enjoyed their meals.) The free WiFi provided by wirelesstoronto.ca is great and worked perfectly. This is definitely a nice place to go for a drink and some food."}
