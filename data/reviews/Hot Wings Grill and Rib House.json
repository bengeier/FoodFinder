{"text":"Service was fast and friendly.  Always some type of drink special.  Typical sports bar atmosphere.  Found the wings to be a touch dry.  I like crispy skin and juicy meat but didn't get that here.  Too much salt in everything.... the batter on the deep fried pickles the fries and the wing dip.  I know it's bar food but the salt was overwhelming.  Might go back for a beer."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the food at this place, as the service was so terrible, I couldn't even order any.   Went to Hot WIngs to watch some NFL playoffs and have some wings one Saturday in January.  My boyfriend and I were the only two people in the entire place.  We ordered a pitcher of beer, and that was the last we saw of our waitress for 45 minutes, when we walked up to her to get the bill.  We tried to flag her down to get appetizers, turn the TV to something other than poker, like PLAYOFF football, but she was more concerned with texting on her phone and eating her cereal at the bar.   When it was about 15 minutes into the game and 45 minutes since we had seen her, we decided to leave and go somewhere else.  I did mention we were the only two people in the place, right?   Don't come to this place if you expect to get any service whatsoever."}
{"text":"I was quite surprised how quiet this establishment was when I visited on a Tuesday wing night. I of course craving chicken ordered wings but they were nothing special, good flavour and very meaty but the actual wings themselves were VERY DRY. With the dill dipping sauce, they did become better, but some pieces were slightly overcooked with noticeable burnt marks on them. My highlight was probably the fries as I agree with my fellow yelpers that they were similiar to Swiss Chalet's but better - seasoned and cooked perfectly crispy, :)"}
{"text":"Attention chili-heads.  I think their 2nd hottest sauce is hotter than duff's hottest, and that's saying something.  I'm scared to find out what the ghost chili sauce is all about.  The 911 had me in an awesome world of hurt, and it's been a while since that has happened.  I did the BBQ wings tossed in the 911 sauce and it was really good, a nice surprise.  The sauce wasn't vinegary, salty, or greasy... just some great tasting pain.  Service was about average but really friendly.  I think next time I will try the suicide.  Oh and the place is pretty cheap too, 30 dollar bill with booze isn't too shabby."}
{"text":"OMG I love this place. So glad that a wing place that does day delivery has opened. Dennis is right about the fries, very like Swiss Chalet which I love. The staff are friendly, haven't gone during a big game so not sure what it's like when crazy busy, usually pretty quiet when I've gone and they have decent deals on pitchers and wings and various midweek specials worth checking out."}
{"text":"I have ordered Hot Wings maybe 4 or 5 times, through just-eat.ca ... it is probably the worst delivery food I have ever eaten. EVERY time we order it, the food takes at the very least 1.5 hours to show up (and i mean every time!!!). Tonight my food took 2.5 hours to come!!! We called the restaurant to check what was going on and the woman on the phone said the driver left an hour ago. wtf. I would also like to mention that they have never once offered a free meal or even a discounted meal due to this constant problem.   When the food does come, it's still good but VERY soggy and the fries taste like absolute crap. If it wasn't for the fact that they offer deep fried pickles i would NEVER EVER eat here.   Maybe going into the restaurant would be a different experience, but in my opinion it's not worth it to order for delivery. I wont be eating here again. Save yourself the headache and a good chunk of money and order from DoubleDouble."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to  write a horrible review, but not only was the food horrible but this establishment also treats their employees atrociously. The food took an hour and a half to arrive and the delivery man was made to pay out of his own wages for the discount we were to receive. The fries were the stale, flavorless, cardboard type and they forgot to include the drinks we ordered and the sauces we were promised. The wings were cold and the sauce hardly covered a third of each wing. I suggest you order from somewhere else."}
{"text":"Different menu deals 7 days a week, always something new to entice you but we usually end up having the wings because they are some of the best in the city. Cheap $10 pitchers and $3 mixed drinks most nights add to how awesome this place is.   Service is hit or miss depending on the server working, sometimes they insist on playing loud R&B Top 40, like its a Sunday afternoon and its a sports bar atmosphere, just put on something we can ignore.    Also beware of the heat range from Hot to Hot Wings 911, its way too wide.  I wouldn't recommend getting anything delivered. The company they use, Just Eat, brings food that is barely warm and soggy. Probably leaving it in the heat bag for too long.   I'd give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the hit or miss service as the food is awesome every time we go."}
{"text":"Logic would suggest that if a place name implies they are some sort of Hot Wings professional that their hot wings would be hot!   Maybe because it was a Sunday evening and the sauce was from the day before but the wings were neither hot or great.   I ordered a pound of hot and honey or was it honey and hot, none the less it had a 3 chilli rating but I would give it a one. Maybe that is just the Punjabi in me talking with my superior spice tolerant genes.  The beer on tap was good although I was having a sissy moment and asked for a half pint to which the waitress laughed and said they only do pints so I adjusted my pants and asked in a more manly tone for a pint.  Interior of the place is not too shabby, standard formula of lots of wood. A few high tables by the window and 4 booths along the wall.   One of the TVs had 'two and a half men' showing so that made the experience slightly better considering the other tvs were showing poker and American softer Rugby."}
{"text":"This place closed a few months ago and Rush Lane is expected to open up, soon."}
{"text":"It took a while but it appears Hot Wings has gone out of business. In a competitive market, even on busy Queen St. W., service has to be a top priority and I would guess that could be the reason for its downfall. The burgers were ok there, along with good fries too, but with the many burger joints popping up, and outdoing each other the competition is fierce. This location has had a few failed businesses start up in it, so let's see who will be the next in line..."}
{"text":"This place is gross. I'm sorry. :( it was empty the whole day Sat. (and Sat. night).  We walked in and it smelled gross, like wet towel combined with unsanitary bar smell (a restaurant shouldn't smell like that).   There is no waitress or check-in person. You walk in and the bartender all the way at the back will yell Hello and tell you to take any seat. We were ignored for a while, took a look at the menu and lack of server/lack of proper seating. We left. Thank God we did- I didn't want to be so prissy but it really smelled in there. Clean up your act, guys!"}
{"text":"The place is alright, I came here to try their Mon-Fri wings lunch special for $7.99 (with a purchase of a drink -_-), my boyfriend got their thursday special: 4 wings, ribs and fries for $9.99.  The food was good, I liked their lemon and pepper wings! However, the service was pretty crap. I had the blonde waiter who wasn't very attentive, we had to flag her down for the bill and when it came, she charged my boyfriend's special double!   The second time I came here was with friends for dinner because we all wanted wings and it was the closest to my work. The restaurant is small, so the two waiters were nice enough to join tables together. The only problem was, one of the waiters threw the menu in front of me. I thought I might've been exaggerating, but my friends also agreed that she did."}
{"text":"We got delivery from this place through Order it.  They were late, the fries were cold and the ribs sucked!  They were not fall off the bone as claimed!  My boyfriend said that the PC frozen ribs are better!  But the pulled pork sandwich and the coleslaw were good."}
{"text":"I'd been here once before and loved how we got the food piping hot and boatloads of fries with our very saucy wings. They were very accommodating about asking us about extras, types of wings, etc. They have a lot of sauces (try ghost chili if you dare) - hot & honey was a bit sweeter than the average place, but I stuck with buffalo style next which is a great amount of buttery hot! We ordered take-out which took about 10 minutes.  However last night we ordered from them from JustEat.ca to be delivered. They're about a 10 minute drive from our apartment and we were told they'd be here in 45 minutes. Half an hour late, I called and ask what was up - due to 'inclement weather' (there was half an inch of snow) and their JustEat.ca sale (20% off $45 or more), they were concentrating on having their orders shipped out so they would arrive hot, rather than put a bunch in the car and have it arrive cold. I appreciated this and waited for another 15 minutes when my stone cold wings and fries arrived. Without the delicious buttermilk sauce that is supposed to come with each pounds of wings (I'm a condiment person, so this kind of took away the whole point for me). The food was good after being in the oven for 10 minutes, but waiting an hour and a half for delivery with NO update on when or why it was late was unacceptable. And to be promised it was late so it would be hot and in fact arrive cold was infuriating.  Definitely won't be ordering delivery from here again. Too many good wing places in the city to wait an hour and a half for chicken."}
{"text":"Come for delicious ribs, stay for the free music video jukebox.   I've been to the wonderful city of Toronto twice and each visit I was sure to stop at this joint. I first came here because I had a bloodlust for ribs and I saw that they had a Sunday deal for ribs and a pint. The ribs were great and plentiful. The sauce is good, but the pulled pork sauce is the better choice. The wings were decent. Next time I'll try another flavor. I don't know too much about Canadian beer, but the beer I had there was average.  I was extremely delighted to discover that the bar feeds the jukebox. While there I was able to watch music videos from Korn and Limp Bizkit while I chowed down on a good meal.  The service is decent and friendly. I highly suggest coming here for ribs or if you want to watch an Evanescence's Bring Me To Life on every TV at the bar."}
{"text":"#YELP #WINGS #TORONTO  Understaffed - this place is pretty much one man run. The guy who took our order was the same guy who went into the kitchen for the next 25 minutes and then brought our food out. Then, instead of checking in on us, he spent the next hour or so cleaning up the page and waiting other tables. My glass of water did not get refilled. #disappoint  My colleagues and I chose to stumble into this place because it looked cheaper than the other restaurants in the neighborhood. Primarily chosen because we'd already spent $$$ on drinks that evening.   PRICE This place is fairly cheap, but then again, for a place that charges as much as any other popular wing place (i.e. Wild Wings) could probably do a better job.   FOOD Despite the name, they do offer mild wings. Some of the menus have an added sticker that say \"New Flavor - Butter Chicken\" ... Piqued my interest and that's what I ordered; definitely not worth it. They came dry, unsaucy, with a wierd curry masala taste.    ONE DAMN THING The fries were embarrassingly good. Hence the 2 star.  ONE OTHER DAMN THING When I ordered a glass of water for my \"drink\" the server totally looked heaven bound and let out the longest sigh. #rude  SPACE Surprisingly big. But fairly run down.   Verdict? I'll remember not to come back."}
{"text":"Wings are not grilled...I repeat NOT GRILLED!! Just another middle of the road deep fried wing place."}
{"text":"The fries are like if you took Swiss Chalet fries and spiced/salted them up a bit so they tingle on the tongue as they melt. I had the pulled pork sandwich and am just wowed at how amazing it was. The pork was tasty, succulent and juicy, covered in delicious BBQ sauce. Felt like a simple but amazing meal.  Beer was great too - what can be said about beer though? - they keep the glasses in a cooler until they pour it so it was nice and cold.  The owner was nice and I got to sample some of the sauces while we talked- some amazing flavours in there! Next time I'll try the wings!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Cold food. Cold service. Even the plain white rice had an awful taste. Do not eat here. Take heed. If I could give less than one star I would."}
