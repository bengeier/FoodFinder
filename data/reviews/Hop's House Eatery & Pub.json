{"text":"I meet up with a cousin at Hop's on a Sunday afternoon.  What a pleasant surprise!  I had the portobello burger and beer cheese soup.  Just great!    I mentioned that I had found the restaurant via Yelp.  And I asked how long they had been open - only a couple of weeks.  They are doing well and were asking for input to improve themselves.  Nice!  One interesting thing is the building.  They are a ways back down a corridor.  It adds some character to the place.  I liked the way they used the space.  Good luck!  I will definitely visit when passing through."}
{"text":"Good beer with a lot of variety, good service, average food.  I like the bar, even though it's fairly small. There are a lot of tap beers that are rotated frequently. Lots of micro-brew and local items you don't really find in bars generally. There is not a large stock of liquor, mostly rail items. There is some seating in the bar area, but an additional dining room as well. The acoustics are really lively, so if there are a lot of customers, it can get noisy.   I've eaten here once and the food was ok, but nothing spectacular. The chicken sandwich I had was served on a brioche bun. It would have been better on ciabbata or something a bit more sturdy as the juice from the chicken and spread soaked into the brioche and made it soggy and crumbly. I needed to finish up with a fork because the bun fell apart. I will say my son's Chicken nuggets were  great! it seems like they were fresh made from real chicken, not frozen compressed chicken. It was a generous portion and they weren't overcooked. Perfect for a toddler!   The desserts here are pretty good and that was the redeeming grace from my meal. They make a root beer cheesecake served with a root beer reduction that is quite fantastic. For not being open very long, I think they are on their way to creating a solid establishment. Definitely a good stop for a few brews and dessert."}
{"text":"We went on a quiet Tuesday night and really enjoyed our time there. The staff was very friendly, and you could tell the food was from scratch -- there is an open kitchen where you can see that the cooks aren't just opening bags from Sysco. We really enjoyed the onion rings, the side of cabbage and bacon, and the burgers and flatbread were all great. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Loved the buffalo chicken dip, at least when we ate it at the restaurant. Hearty, steaming bowl with just enough chips surrounding it (but we could have asked for more). Wasn't so crazy about it when we ordered pick up one day:  I'd say we got about 1/3 cup of the dip and a small box of chips. Definitely not worth the $10 it cost. Same with the taco salad...Why am I paying $14 for a bowl of romaine and ground beef? We'll be back once more to give it a try, but definitely won't be ordering out anymore due to inconsistency. Bring back the little Italian place that was once here."}
{"text":"Visited 3x before writing this review.  Upshot:  OK food and service for a small town, but misses the mark on some key points of restaurant experience  The good: 1. friendly service 2. house salad seemed to have fresh, possibly local ingredients 3. beer selection is good (~20+ microbrews on tap) but prices are a bit high relative to other places nearby 4. separate dining area that's good for groups of 10-12  Areas for improvement 1. service basics: forgetting to bring you napkins/utensils, handing you glasses with servers hands touching the top of the glass, where you drink,  2. prices of specials not matching your bill ($4 Wisconsin beers showed up as $5or $6/beer on bill) 3. ambience and lighting in back room could be warmer.  That said it's nice to have another restaurant in town. Seems they are improving... despite the negative reviews from others, my companions enjoyed their burgers, and my plate wasn't cold!"}
{"text":"Sliders consisted of 2 very small overdone chicken sandwiches. Expected 3 for $12 sliders. Portobello appetizer was overdone. Burger was so-so. Bar was small and hot. Even though the kitchen asked first our feedback, which was incredibly awkward, they still charged full price for food that we literally couldn't eat. Flies all over. They are new. Maybe in time things will improve. Just go to the reliable, good quality, good service Grumpy Troll in town instead."}
{"text":"Awesome pretzel bites. Good beer selection. Friendly bartenders. Worth the stop will be back"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Rustic atmosphere.  The Hop burger was a wonderful burst of flavor and was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Stopped in two weeks after they opened.  Burger was tasteless and below average.  Not sure how a restaurant can screw up a burger.   We want this place to be successful and we will go again but if the food all sucks we won't be back.  Owners. ..do you actually taste the foods you are serving?  Cook/chefs credentials?"}
{"text":"Very cute place with great ambiance. We sat in the bar which was very cozy with a fireplace.  The service was excellent.  Our server, Becky, was great and very attentive and the owner also checked in on us.  They have some fun signature cocktails and a great beer selection.  Our food was very good, especially the trout.  I'd definitely recommend coming here for drinks and food."}
{"text":"Our group of 7 ate at here for first time tonight. We found atmosphere very comfortable and homey.  Night was busy as people poured in after the beer fest but staff seemed prepared and our service was excellent.   Appatizer round was beer balls and potabella sticks, both very good but think bet balls were best. We'll seasoned flavorful meatballs. My wife  and I got a hop  house burger and the deconstructed jambalaya. Burger was a good combination of flavors. cooked to order very enjoyable. But the jambalaya was awesome! Shrimp pork belly combined wonderfully with the spicy risotto cake and sauce.  A creative take on one of my favorite dishes that I will go back for.  A great dinner in a comfy place, will be back many times  and I didn't  even go into the bloody mary an d special bacon pancake cocktail."}
{"text":"Best damn burger in town!!! They are new right now so help the staff out. Great people that love to serve you! The owner is wonderful and will meet you at the host stand. Delicious fresh food!!! Come check it out. Great atmosphere of an old building from a former Italian run restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place, wonderful fresh ingredients from the local farmers market, friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, nice drink selection and great food.   I got the jambalaya etoufee and it was a delicious approach to the classic. Shrimp and pork belly were cooked beautifully. My only suggestion for improvement would be temperature, it was a little cool (the plate was stone cold so it was probably what cooled sauces, etc down so fast)   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous experience tonight! The service was wonderful (THANK YOU BECKY!) and the food was delicious. We had the Jambalaya and 8oz Sirloin Steak with Stout Mushroom Gravy. Both dishes exceeded our expectations! Thank you, Hop's House for a great \"Date Night\"."}
{"text":"Ate there yesterday. Good Beer cheese Soup. Great variety of craft beers. Owner was very nice, friendly and personable. 2nd time there and pleased both times."}
{"text":"After anxiously waiting for this place to open up, I got my chance to try it last night... and it did not disappoint!  Hands down, best pub food in town and highest quality kids menu.  The food was very good, and the service was excellent.  Their selection of beers is the best in town, and they source many of their ingredients from local farmers, etc.  We need more places like this!  Both my husband and I had the portabella burger, which came with an excellent aioli.  He had a side of mac & cheese; I had the rosemary garlic mashed potatoes.  Both were very good.  My kids had the chicken tenders; one had a side salad (yes, they actually let kids get a side salad if they want!) and the other had fruit (fresh fruit cut earlier that day).  Flavor on all was excellent.  One tiny, tiny negative - because the food is served on white, large dishes, a beige burger and beige potatoes or pasta kind of get lost on the plate and it makes the portions seem small.  When I first got my food, I felt the portions weren't very big - it was my husband that pointed out the plate sizing - but I was satisfied when I was finished.  If they had oblong or smaller plates, coupled perhaps with a slice or two of their house-made pickles, that would really round it out.  And sides are cheap; just pile them on! :)  However, I'm not looking to take pretty pictures of my food; I'm there to be served in a reasonable amount of time, and to eat good-tasting food that's \"real\" and preferably local - it's a rare find to find all of that in one package.  Just may become our go-to restaurant in Mt. Horeb!"}
{"text":"Outstanding meatball slider and grown up mac-n-cheese! Bartender really knows the menu and his beer assortment. Fantastic find!"}
{"text":"Tried Hop's House for the first time tonight and I was very impressed. The service was excellent. The bartender, Jack, was attentive and made sure we were taken care of. I ordered Hop's Burger and it did not disappoint. The bacon remoulade was an incredible addition to the burger. They have a nice tap list which has a variety of styles (I had a hefeweizen and a porter). Overall Hop's House is a welcome addition to the neighborhood and a restaurant I will certainly be visiting again."}
{"text":"Lots of beer to choose from.   Beef balls flavorless cooked well.   Cheese soup good but small cup for the money.   Portobello mushroom decent not the best but not the worst."}
{"text":"Great experience today! My husband and I are road tripping for our 7th anniversary.  Had Caesar salads with shrimp and chicken.  Fantastic.  Beer choice is awesome.  A great little restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I like what they are doing. I've had a steak salad and the chicken caprisi sandwich here on these occasions. The steak salad was very good, the chargrilled steak was properly done sirloin and served with a nice vinaigrette. The chicken sandwich was also very good except for the bun choice. Again a very good chargrilled chicken breast with a nice tomato and mozzarella and a proper amount of aioli. However a croissant bun isn't hearty enough to hold up to the juiciness, I would suggest a nice chewy hard roll if they read these reviews. It was served with some very nice seared brussel sprouts cooked with a couple of apple slices.   Service at the bar was very good when I sat there. The dining room service was OK but they are new and seem to still be figuring it out. I expect it should improve as they mature.   They have 22 beers on tap and a couple of ciders. A bit heavy on the pale ales, which is my favorite style, they could use more porter and a lager or two. A good sampling if WI beers though.   Pricing is OK, $5 for a beer and food prices are appropriate. You can an get a Hopilicious or Fantasy Factory for $0.50 less down the street at Main Street or the Firehouse though.   I like the spot and there is potential. I've heard some of their deep fried grub isn't that good. I guess it is good I try to avoid that. I would like to see a few more healthy choices on the menu. It is a bit limited but they are still learning."}
{"text":"This is a great location and easy to get to. I ate here on a Tuesday evening. Very few folks here. The service was excellent. The restroom clean.  I ordered the sliders and on a recommendation of a review on here got the side of mac and cheese. Delish. The sliders were fine. The mac n cheese is definitely a 'grown up' version. It was wonderful.  I also had Spotted Cow on tap. Yummy as always.   I would definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Good beer selection  Not good planning for seating groups - we are a couple put in a room with families and a large group and had a hard time having a conversation above everyone else and had walked by another room with just one table   Food was fine but nothing worth coming back for - dry brioche for both of our sandwiches  If we return, it will be to visit the bar only"}
{"text":"I live in the area and paid this place a visit.  They have an excellent beer selection which made me happy since I consider myself a beer connoisseur.  Beers are $5 a pint and some high gravity ones are $6.  I think those prices are slightly high but not the end of the world.  However, my girlfriend ordered 2 glasses of white wine that she recognized and they were $9 per glass (and the glasses are very small - probably 4oz pours).  She said the same bottle at the store is around $8.  So we got our bill and it was $29 plus tax for two small glasses of wine and two pints of beer.  After tax and tip, It was $36 for two drinks each.  My girlfriend and I both agreed their prices are too high.  It shouldn't cost almost $40 for a few drinks.  We didn't try the food but I'm guessing the prices will be similar.  I'll come back and try the food, and I will change my review if I feel differently.  But for now, I think its overpriced for Mount Horeb.  I definitely won't be coming here for guys night out with these prices."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very nice in the bar area and the bar keep knew his beer! Our waitress was fantastic and the food was good too! You can tell the food is fresh and from original recipes. There is no reason not to give this place a try for a change of pace from the others in town. Overall great place!"}
