{"text":"Very cozy restaurant. Although it's located at the very end of the street, it's worth the walking. The interior design is beautiful and you can just sit down and enjoy the dinner and conversation."}
{"text":"Great low key restaurant, not too busy. Food are fair, decent price and good quality. Fried soft shell crab are amazing."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good.  Miso was a cut above the usual salty fare, they dropped off a little tempura shrimp with it, nice touch.  The lunch combo A was nice.  The tempura shrimp roll was crispy and fresh.  The sushi sported a generous amount of fish to rice ratio. All in all a nice meal.    The decor is cute and clean.  They seriously gotta lay off the crappy pop rap though... Left some Picts.    Very friendly with good prompt service.    I'd come back, with ear plugs. ;)"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Maki - nice and fresh fish, and the specialty rolls are very well done. We had the kamikaze and the lobster roll, both of which were great. Good amount of fish on the rolls too. Nice and quiet atmosphere, but the service was a little slow."}
{"text":"It used to be very good, but the last time I went, they started using cheaper ingredients, and skimping on ingredients as well. There was no balance of sweet and salty as there used to be. I felt bad for suggesting that we go here, after I had hyped it up."}
{"text":"My all-time favorite Japanese restaurant! Excellent food and service! Super fresh sashimi! Recommend Uni sushi and seared fish sushi! Creative and delicious deep fried rolls. Recommend beef sashimi and hamachi Kama for appetizer!"}
{"text":"So disappointed! Overall quality is about 3 out of 10. Sushi rice is raw and has no vinegar taste. I miss the old time when it owned by Jason."}
{"text":"Another good lunch spot. This place is around $10-13 for lunch which is a little pricier than other places around but its worth it. I got the chirashi and it one of my favorites. Comes with around 9 pieces of sashimi, a tempura shrimp and some seaweed salad. They put a sweet sauce on the rice too kinda like the sauce on the eel). The sushi lunch b is good too. It comes with 3 pieces of the aburi sushi which is a very nice surprise. The only down side is, I did go when there was only one server and the service was really slow. But another time I went there were two waitresses and it was better. So I guess they've improved."}
{"text":"Decent food here. I like the booth I was in. Very comfortable and spacious. The food itself was passable but not great.  Green dragon roll did not seem like the traditional way. It was way more crunchy than usual and had a creamy sauce on it. See photos.  Also the maki rolls were falling apart. It was very difficult to eat them."}
{"text":"Really good lunch deal! 9 pieces salmon bento only for 10 bucks. Good quality. Serving with miso soup and 2 side dishes. We are three ppl ordered a full table dishes. 3 bento boxes, appetizer, hand roll, sushi and sashimi. And only need to pay $58 plus tips. They changed their menu 1 month ago and I am sure I will go to there more often than before!"}
{"text":"Had a dinner for two. The food was excellent. The appetizer we ordered was a sizzler which was a pleasant surprise. The service was fast and courteous. The plum wine was a bit expensive and more ice than wine. The main course were their two dragon rolls and the Kamikaze roll. All of which were well served and delicious. Over all a good dining experience though the decor could use some updating."}
{"text":"3.5 stars rating.  For the price and quality, they have done their job. Service is not the best and surprisingly the waitress wasn't in a very good mood today. We had Chirashi donburi lunch and for $11 it has met my expectations, not the above average quality but able to deliver it at that price range. Miso soup is too salty for me (please note I'm.not a fan of miso soup that comes free at Japanese or Korean restaurant). Salad was OK. We also had the salmon teriyaki with shrimp tempura roll bento,  it's alright for $10. I say there are better options in the area but as our first time visiting this restaurant, it isn't too bad."}
{"text":"Last Saturday, my friend and I went to this place for a dinner. I've been to many sushi places in this area and downtown Toronto as well, but this was the best experience for a fresh sashimi roll ever!! Truly, my friend and I became big fans of this place and we will visit again this weekend.   My friend tried the raw fish for the first time and he liked it very much. I also let him try the tuna sashimi, yellow tail sashimi, mountain roll (has the spicy salmon inside and salmon on top). We also had a bento box combination. The sashimi was the best sashimi I have ever tried in Toronto area. It was so fresh. Presentation was great. The waiter was very helpful. He knows the stuff very well. He even explained everything patiently and recommending those stuff.   Well, I can't wait to go back to this place again on the weekend. I definitely highly recommend this place to any sushi lover!"}
{"text":"One of my most favorite sushi restaurants, fish is always fresh and I enjoy the speed of the service. Always recommend to friends or family."}
{"text":"It's saving grace is the tempura. Best I've had in the city. You'd have to try it. Big pieces, coating not heavy or greasy, taste was excellent!  Everything else like the sushi, sashimi, chicken terriyaki were terrible in my bento box I had for lunch they didn't look or taste fresh.   Saw a special that may be noteworthy for some cheapos, $2 California Rolls every Tuesday, limit 2 per customer :D"}
{"text":"Just an update to my review. Although I enjoy their sushi, their cooked dishes are TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place in North York! Ordered Osaka sushi boat and raw shrimp sashimi, they are amazing! Prefect size for 2 people. Sushi can be made seared lightly here, I love them! And they have parking space at back so you don't have to park at street."}
{"text":"Good value for the lunch combos. They have a bento with only sushi, neat!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on a side street, we almost missed it. It is quite spacious inside and was not very busy during  lunch time on a weekday. The servers were friendly, we got our food pretty quickly. I got unagi don, it was good and had a nice presentation. Really liked the appetizer which were some deep fried potato noodle wrapped in seaweed. The food were decent and reasonably priced. I would come back again if I am in the area to try the sushi."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this restaurant because it has parking in Sheppard and Yonge area. It's a very cozy restaurant with great service. My boyfriend ordered a chicken terriyaki dinner; and I ordered Mackerel and Salmon sashimi. We also shared a spider roll. After we ordered the dinner, the server told us there's a Sunday special - if our order is over $30, we will have a free appetizer. So we chose Goyza.   The food were great! For the teriyaki chicken, we could see some nice char marks on it!My boyfriend really love the chicken breast. For the sashimi, they were really fresh and tasty! The mackerel were exceptional!   I would definitely revisit this restaurant in the future!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful discovery! We got the Tokyo platter, which was beautiful, bountiful and delicious. The quality of the product is great for this price range. The dragon roll is also fantastic (for those who digg a little soft shell in their lives). The only reason I didn't rate them a full 5 stars is because they use regular soy sauce to season the sushi on the Tokyo platter and the sodium level was much too high for my liking. But other then that, this place is great and I look forward to eating in the restaurant soon (we ordered take away this time)."}
{"text":"We come here every weekend, the salmon and the tuna are always spectacular.  Always exceptionally fresh and very tasty -- I am extremely sensitive when it comes to fish not being fresh. This is the only place in Toronto which has fish that can compare to that from BC.  You have to ask what fish is good -- they always have something special which has never failed to be impressive.   The service is excellent.  For the quality of the fish the price is, by the way, beyond reasonable."}
{"text":"Great spot! Very quiet on weekdays. We went on a Wednesday and the place was dead.   Anyway, I ordered a roll set (2 rolls, plus salad and soup)! :) I couldn't finish everything. I think the regular roll was great but the deep-fried roll was over the top. I couldn't finish it. I think they make great sushi and it was $18 for everything. It is a bit pricey but the quality is there.   They also have cute booths for couples and a somewhat hidden seating area near the entrance, it's nice."}
{"text":"Kiyomizu is my destination when I'm looking for high quality Japanese food in the Yonge/Sheppard area.  Atmosphere: My favourite seat in the restaurant are the wooded booths. Each booth has a short hanging curtain that provides priavcy and an intimate feel. The restaurant is also quiet, with low ambient music that makes it easy to hold a conversation. It's a good date night spot.  Service: The servers are very friendly, lots of smiles and soft spoken. Each dish arrives quickly and is plated with care. They also have daily specials and other promotions for returning customers. Last time when I got my bill, they had a spinning wheel with prizes. I landed on a free appetizer coupon, pretty cool.  Food: Of the string of Japanese restaurants on the street, I would say Kiyomizu offers the highest quality. This does come at a steeper price but it's a worthwhile indulgence. Their rolls are light on the rice and their sashimi is very fresh. Their cooked menu items are also well done and you can tell they were thought out, not just added to the menu to follow the \"izakaya\" trend."}
{"text":"Not just because the owner is friend of my dad but the food there is pretty good.  Sushi and sashimi were awesome. As another reviewer mentioned, tables were separated well for private dining. However it is not recommended for large groups of people, b/c seats are not moveable and tables are set for only about 6 people."}
{"text":"Hey guys,  First time here and I was totally impressed with the great quality of sushi for the price.  My mind isn't totally made up about the service as one of the servers was great and the other was a bit of a tool.  The fish was amazing, portions are huge and prices are very reasonable, especially for how good it was.  I totally recommend it, not much I've had that could beat it in this area.  Thanks"}
{"text":"The portions were more than generous, and the rolls had a great rice to filling ratio. Further, the ingredients were clearly fresh. My only concerns were that my chicken teriyaki was slightly dry and the prices were relatively steep. Overall, I would eat at this place again."}
{"text":"First time I went with my boyfriend, it was a pretty good experience so I went back to take more of my friends this past weekend and I was kind of disappointed by how slow the service was. We ordered a love boat and it took almost an hour to get. We ordered another roll but had to get it to go because it was taking so long... Not that bad of a place if you are not in a rush to get anywhere after.  It wasn't even super busy which is why I was even more frustrated with how long it was taking...  But it is a decent ambience and the sushi is pretty decent."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday. Sashimi was very fresh. Tempura is good too. Kinda of pricey for dinner, but you get what you paid for. I would definitely come back to try their lunch special."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend and it was okay. The sushi was decent and average. Some of the rolls were definitely better than some others. I really liked how the waitress brought us hit towels to clean our hands before our meal. I thought that was a nice touch.   I would recommend this restaurant for an affordable sushi meal at Yonge and Sheppard. :)"}
{"text":"In the sushi lovers' haven that is the Yonge & Sheppard area, this is a hidden gem. Tucked into a little street branching off of Yonge, Kiyomizu is a restaurant with thoughtful service, fragrant maki, and tempura that pleases. I have tried other sushi locations in the area (Sushi Moto, Ichiban, etc.) but none compare. I came for dinner at about 6pm and ordered the sweet potato tempura, harumaki (spring roll), crunch roll, green dragon roll and red bean ice cream. The harumaki was a bit average, but all else delighted! The server was helpful in accommodating dietary restrictions of others at my table, but sometimes became a bit busy with her other customers, leaving us to ask another server at the restaurant for occasional assistance.   Kiyomizu itself is decorated beautifully - there are small strings of lights placed across the restaurant which create an elegant ambiance (think quiet and intimate, relative to the sports bar feel of Sushi Moto), and the booths are cozy and comfortable. Sushi quality is wonderful (probably close to Sushi Moto, although I liked this place better!).   Four stars instead of five only because of the small service lapse mentioned above, as well as the high price for veggie tempura ($8 for about 6 pieces of yam seemed excessive - Hockey Sushi will give you 8 for $3!). Great experience overall."}
{"text":"Went there a year ago, first and last time being there. Food was good. However, besides another group of 2, my gf and I were the only ones in the restaurant. It took 20 minutes to get a menu and 1 hour before our food arrived. We felt invisible to the server and when we didn't tip him, he seemed to be offended, you could tell by his facial expression when he looked at the receipt and how he quietly hurried us out. Seriously though, how long does it take to serve an empty restaurant? It wasn't busy that evening at all."}
{"text":"A really cute place in the neighborhood, better than sushi moto. Came here a few times. Usually pretty quiet since there are two adjacent Japanese restaurants. I really like the traditional decor and the service. And they have little booths inside perfect for couples.   The rolls are really good here. I ordered the crunch roll and red dragon roll, both delicious. The beef yaki udon wasn't that good, I don't recommend it. It does seem a little pricey but I'm usually satisfied with my meal.   They also have great lunch options that I have gotten for take out before. The lunches are more economical. I come here when I don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"that's one of the few places in yng/sheppard area where I go for lunch.  I like the decor - feels authentic. not the music though. every time we get there it's a collection of oldies... still listenable... but why not japanese classical music?  anyway. none of my friends every complained about the food.  they only have one veg bento box on lunch special but it's pretty good and very filling.   tea+miso soup +orange at the end = included.  they also introduced discount cards - collect 4 lunch stamps and get 5th one with 13% discount. collect 9 and get 10th with $10 discount. sounds as a good idea.  the lunches end up costing around $12 with tax+tip."}
{"text":"Spring Garden Ave has more Japanese restaurants than the TTC has delays. The only one I find worth going back to is Kiyomizu - especially if you are a sashimi person. Fresh and melt in your mouth - and always excellent quality. I would say it is around 25% more expensive than the other Japanese places on Spring Garden but the difference in quality is stark - truly stark. And the sashimi boats are always accompanied with miso soup, salad and a small dolop of green tea ice cream. When I want to go cheap, I go to Ichiban on the same street but if I want quality, I go Kiyomizu."}
{"text":"This is one of the better sushi places in Toronto and I'd say it's the best in the Yonge/Sheppard area. The prices here are a little steep, but it's worth it. I've seen some places that jack up their prices just because they spent a lot on decorations and hired a Japanese waitress, but still serve the same stuff you find elsewhere. You'll be greeted by waitresses dressed in kimono. They are Korean by the way.   What sets this place apart is the attention to details on the food, and the freshness of their fish. Their salmon sashimi is definitely the freshest I've had in a while. It's so fresh, and I don't detect ANY signs of it being frozen before. The rolls are nicely decorated. Even the tempura is better than other places. Portions are nice and the \"stuff\" to rice ratio is perfect.   If you're price conscious, they have lunch specials offered at slightly better prices ($12+). But this isn't the kind of place you should come to if you're sensitive to prices. Most rolls are above $10. Stick with the fish items because things like chicken katsu or teriyaki can be obtained elsewhere for similar quality. A good sushi place is defined by their sushi quality first. Kitchen stuff is secondary. Definitely come here for the sashimi/sushi.   Is it the best sushi place? Probably not. But it's a step above most places. When you consider that a lot of upscale sushi places are charging you an arm and a leg for superficial reasons, it actually makes the prices here seem worthwhile."}
{"text":"It is a bit pricy but the food quality is good. My friend and I had the maki roll combo, it was delicious! Combo comes with the soup and salad. The waitress was super nice and the tea was really good too! It is a nice environment, not a lot of people, good for business lunch."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place was nice and quiet although we did go at an odd hour so no one else was inside. But it seemed like a lot of people were ordering take out as it still took about 15 or so minutes for us to get our sushi rolls. We ordered two rolls each. I noticed the chef has his hat on but did not tie it up so his long hair was waving around and partially covering his face. I was very careful whole eating my food. The food however was good. Average I would say but not bad. The location was convenient and quiet as it isn't along the Yonge strip but on a side street. The waitresses seemed to continue to converse amongst themselves and were on their phone with their backs to us but I guess seeing as the place was completely empty, they had nothing else to do. I don't think I would come back especially because there are so many other sushi joints in the area and I've tried a couple that I enjoyed more."}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch, only cost me $11 for noodle and California rolls as lunch combo, the waitress also served a fired fish, so that is a good deal. I ordered nabe/chicken noodle, really like it, the California roll is also very tasty, they got plenty of food on the menu, I'm goona try the teriyaki next time. The decor is typical Japanese style but with a lot of private space, each table is separated and there's no noisy music so that you can have conversations, or enjoy lunch/diner by yourself like I did:)"}
{"text":"Came here tonight at around 10 pm. The restaurant was empty but it was clean and cozy.  We received very attentive service and good food. Ordered chicken teriyaki and pork katsu, as husband does not like sushi. Both dishes tasted great. Pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"We came here after moto sushi had a 40 hour wait time. So like any experiences yelper, I pulled out the app and saw this place within 150m. Done deal.  The food here was yummy for also a great value. I got the chicken Bento box and my total was under $10. Maki set A was also about $10 and came with 3 rolls with 6 pieces each, more than enough to fill you up. The portions seemed smaller than other places however. Most other places give you 3 pieces of a sushi roll at least and tempura, which was missing here. My chicken teriyaki came with a small portion of glass noodles, some garlic marinated zucchini, some rice that was slapped into the box, and salad. Wasn't too impressive.  Service was okay as well considering it was a lunch rush. Would be interesting to try it at a time less busy. The chef's kept shouting, seemingly to themselves, and that was quite irritating. We're trying to have lunch, talk, and catch up. No need to yell like that.  The atmosphere was nice and cozy with an area with a lot of natural light near the front, but the rest was quite dark with some string lights everywhere.  Overall, I'd probably be driven away from coming back because the value you get is not up to par with other places in the area. Gotta keep up, the competition in North York is intense and this place seems to be falling behind."}
{"text":"I'm here right now and haven't gotten my food since my order AN HOUR AGO.   The servers are not attentive and rude.   No apologies for the wait and their excuse is \"other people ordered before you\".  Okay, that means that it's acceptable for me to wait an hour before anything but tea arrives?  There are plenty of Japanese restaurants in the area. This is not one I'll return to.   Some of my sashimi came frozen.   The sushi rice was hot for rolls. It cooked my raw sashimi.   Will not return."}
{"text":"Spring Gardens Avenue is lined with Japanese restaurants. It's hard to tell them all apart. Kiyomizu is the last and furthest (east) restaurant from Yonge Street.  It's a cozy little restaurant, that serves pretty good food.   The nice thing about this restaurant is that they have a lot of booths and their tables (non booth ones) are all separated, giving each table a somewhat private dining experience.  Their service is quite fast, I've never experienced a problem dining here.  They have a lot of bento box and combo selections so you're sure to find something you like. I order their veggie bento box, which comes with tempera, rice, salad, soup, a roll and a side dish (different ones, depends on the day).  It's more than filling, and reasonable priced!   At lunch time (which is when I'd usually go), it's busy but never to the point where you have to wait for a table.  The lunch crowd are usually business workers who work in the corporate towers close by."}
{"text":"For a small Japanese/Korean mom and pop joint the sushi was pretty fresh. Ordered the boat with 2 other girls. Would def go again for their sushi."}
{"text":"Spring Garden Avenue in the Yonge and Sheppard area, specifically just East of Yonge has a few sushi restaurants. Kiyomizu is the most east but also the most expensive... not by much.  That said, the quality can certainly warrant the price. I've only been there with larger groups but each time, we got some salmon teriyaki on the house which is always nice.  Atmosphere-wise, I do find the place the most comfortable when compared to the others."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner for on a Tuesday around 7.30pm by just walking around the area and was recommended by the complex's landlord. The restaurant had plenty of tables available at the time. We got a booth seat which was nice and comfortable, the place is quiet enough for conversation with cheesy pop holiday music playing in the background which provided some giggles. The waitress was nice but seemed a bit clueless and always had to go back and forth to the kitchen when we asked questions about their menu and daily selection.   We wanted to get some a la carte sashimi, but it seems like they were out of all the higher end fish. We got the uni sushi which was good again felt fresh and didn't have that bad taste you get from uni sometimes. We split the assorted regular sashimi which came with salmon, tuna, surf clam, and some sort of white fish. The fish itself was good and felt fresh. The plate came with white rice, a salad and miso soup. However the plastic miso soup bowl had such a strong bleach/chlorine taste and smell we couldn't even drink it, it felt like pool water. Would not be returning anytime soon with all the other sushi options in the area."}
{"text":"Unfortunately when I walked by there today, the restaurant was closed and out of business.  I'm sorry to see this place go as they had great food, wonderful staff and a nice atmosphere.  The place next door was more of a bar and had people outside smoking, along with loud noise, I guess that may have stopped regular folks from going to Kiyomizu. But I'm not too sure.  Another great restaurant in Willowdale bites the dust."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time now and I finally got the chance to. The overall look of the restaurant is very nice and cozy and I was greeted almost immediately by a friendly face. I ended up getting the Unagi Don or Grilled Freshwater Eel with Eel sauce on rice (forgot to take a picture of it but it looked beautiful) and can say I'm pleasantly surprised. Although it did seem a little lacking in quantity, keep in mind this dish is $15, it more than made up for in its quality. Other Unagi Dons I've had were pretty subpar and drowned in sauce, however this one was very tender/soft and the sauce not too overpowering. It also came with a good amount of rice to go with the Unagi and a delicious bowl of Miso soup. Also there's free parking in the back and open late which is always a plus."}
{"text":"For someone that has tried both takeout and AYCE sushi, this was a great improvement. Although pricy (about $20 with tip) and not exactly filling, the quality of the sushi goes unmatched in my memory. I ordered \"Take\" which includes 12 assorted types of nigiri sushi (sashimi on rice) w/ 3 California rolls. Honestly, skip this deal and get more nigiri sushi, you can get the rolls anywhere. Came with a salad but no miso soup, which was disappointing.   Had the seafood pancake as well (too much Mayo/bad filling-to-seafood ratio) and the dessert (ice cream - red bean/green tea/black bean) is great, although an additional price. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"My hunger drove me to walk over to Kiyomizu tonight, alone!  I ordered four dishes, a lot for my tiny frame.  Nothing went to waste!  I ordered Sapporo beer and a bottle of Organic Nama Sake.  Half the bottle was adequate for me so I gave the other half to a couple who had just arrived and thought they'd love the experience of drinking beer and cold sake alternately.  Agedashi Tofu around the world is pretty good, but tonight's Agedashi Tofu is probably the best one so far in Toronto recently.  Usually the batter is too thick and sometimes the broth isn't quiet as good, but this one really did it for me.  I hanker after a certain Agadashi at a hole in the wall place in Sydney, Australia, where a local food critic treated me to dinner last month.  This one is the closest, the broth not quiet as good, not gingery enough, but the deep fried tofu batter was almost parallel, frail, the fragile stringy bits a little gooey (how I like them)!  I also ordered the Hiyashi Tofu, a cold tofu with green onion, ginger and sesame oil, a real treat on a hot summer's day.  Nasu Dengaku, grilled eggplant with sweet miso and sesame sauce was beautifully seared over the barbecue and finally the Legend Dragon stood up to it's name, avocado, cucumber, deep fried shrimp wrapped in spicy salmon with sauce and fish eggs. Suddenly being back home in Toronto after a great deal of traveling and eating Japanese in Paris and Sydney, isn't that bad.  I'll definitely go back in a hurry to my neighbourhood bestie and try some other dishes soon! In the mean time, if you like any of the four dishes I tried, don't wait!  Genmaicha was all I could handle to round things off but Black Sesame Ice Cream caught my eye. Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"The best Japanese restaurant around North York area.  The food: 10/10  Their sashimi are always fresh. Specialty rolls are unbelievably delicious. I live around the area, I tried both Kiyomizu and Moto Sushi. I know Moto sushi is a hot spot in town. But surprisingly, I prefer Kiyomizu. There food are tasty and fresher in my opinion.  The service: 9/10  Servers are friendly and super nice here. However, during busy dinner time, I think they are under staff The ambience: 10/10  The restaurant is very dim which I like. It is clean and cozy. Nothing to complain.  If you are in the area, you should give it a try. You'll love it !"}
{"text":"As the Yelp star system suggests: \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  I came here for dinner because I saw the awesome reviews, but after ordering their oyako-don, I was pretty disappointed - the flavour was subpar and the rice itself was non-traditional. Their maki rolls (we had their spider roll) tasted pretty good, but again, meh, I've experienced better. *cough* Inaho *cough*  As a bonus, though, they have free parking behind the building, so yay for convenience!"}
{"text":"Nice place! It has a good vibe, I really felt like I was in a restaurant in Japan.  I'd definitely come back later in the evening as it's a nice joint to have a nice drink and a few sashimi!  The food was clean and tasty...woukdnt say It outdid an AYCE but I'd come back here again and try more of their special rolls."}
{"text":"I had no idea this restaurant existed until my friend and I decided to yelp for sushi near his area!   Friday evening, and I was craving sushi -  the only problem was that we only had half an hour prior to our movie that was going to be on soon.  Decor is like a typical, quaint, Japanese restaurant.  Service was friendly and great.  We told them that we were catching a show, and they were quick about it.  They served us an interested soup with enoki mushrooms in it.  Loved it.    Fellow yelper, Chris T., ordered a temaki set A - which was a bunch of handrolls together - filling and delicious.  I ordered the Legend Boston Roll - it was pretty good, but I think it had a bit too much mayo in it.   The only problem about this place is that the place is pretty pricey comparatively speaking to the other sushi restaurants that I've been to!"}
{"text":"Fairly sizeable inside compared to the small street just off of yonge street. I was there for lunch by myself and had the Sushi lunch B for $12 CAD. The food was great, I was full afterwards and I didn't feel like there was too much rice which seems to be a common issue with most sushi places. One thing I did notice was there was only one waitstaff in the entire place during lunch time (1200-1300) and some of the patrons were understandably befuddled."}
{"text":"Went here with a large group last week - delicious!  We tried a wide selection of appetizers including the fried tofu with something on top (I forget what that is called...), kalbi ribs, gyoza, yakitori. Everything was very good.  Also had the maki rolls which were very big portions and also good. Good value for money.   Service was attentive. It's a quiet restaurant but they do tend to fill up.  I will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed by Kiyomizu because there are numerous Japanese restaurants around the area. This restaurant is run by Koreans but are extremely friendly and attentive in regards to service.   They offer lunch specials until 3pm and an extensive menu. The price is average, a little higher for some but I felt it was worth the quality of sushi I received. I got the spicy salmon rolls and lunch bento (chicken katsu) with salad and two sides (deep fried japchae roll and salmon). I forgot the prices but I think this is my favorite for spicy salmon rolls.   My friend and I also got complementary calamari. Overall I would definitely come back and try the other items on the menu. Worth checking out again! :)"}
{"text":"+.5 for service  I liked this place! I stopped by here for lunch a couple of days ago, deciding between here and Moto down the block. I decided to try this place first and Moto at another time.  The prices are definitely reasonable for lunch specials, averaging around $10. The Sushi Lunch A had a couple of seared salmon and tuna sushi; a bit more unique than the regular salmon/tuna/butterfish most restaurants use for lunch specials. They also put the wasabi in the fish, as what most restaurants should do unless otherwise requested.  It also came with 6 pieces of california roll that also tasted quite good!  Miso soup was not too salty and not too bland; just the way I like it. The salad had quite a lot of stuffings though lacked a bit of lettuce. The sauce was decent as well.  Service was great. I was attended to the whole time and the waitress refilled my tea without having me to ask her, and they didn't try to rush me out once I finished my meal.  Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Quality sashimi balanced by tasteful cooked plates, beautifully arranged plates,   beautiful ambience,  extensive ETOH menu,  and charming chef and waitress. Brought an out of town friend here and couldn't be happy having shared our limited time together at this dining experience."}
{"text":"Loved this place few years ago, not anymore. Tried couple of sushi (lunch combo B) that includes 3 sushi rolls, miso soup and small salad. I did not like any of the sushi, Kiyomizu roll was my least favorite. It had way too many fish roe on top and it tasted way too fishy for me. I think other people might enjoy it, but I will order another combo for my next visit."}
{"text":"Have been there a lot and have never had a bad experience.  Don't expect a \"budget meal\" because it isn't.  It is a relatively peaceful and serene dining environment which is nice when you are savouring well-cut, well-prepared sashimi.  Their nigiri sushi can sometimes have a bit too much rice but its hit and miss depending on who is behind the counter.  Fish is fresh, fair amount of variety.  Not disappointing."}
{"text":"The rolls were amazing! I wish i could just sit here and eat to my hearts content!   Whenever I visit a friend, we will always order take out or visit Kiyomizu. No matter what you order, the food is always fresh and perfect to taste. Service is always excellent. Price wise, it is on the high side (yes i love my deals) but once in a while... you must indulge!  I highly recommend the Krazy boy (fried on the outside) & Kamikaze Salmon (slightly spicy but bloody good).  Whenever you order takeout, you will receive a 10% off coupon. Make sure to use it!"}
{"text":"We came across this restaurant completely by accident. The service was excellent and the atmosphere was pretty good. We ordered the Osaka boat which was advertised to serve 2 people but I thought it was a little small. However the food was fresh and very tasty. We'll be back for sure but next time get something bigger."}
{"text":"Nice hidden space tucked in a side street. The space is dim and quiet. Great spot for date nights.   We tried the Unagi Kabayaki ($12) and the Kamakazi Roll ($11). The Unagi had very little eel in it. There were 3 maybe 4 (at most) broken pieces. Was served on a hot sizzling plate and completely hidden in onions. For the roll, we were unable to taste the assorted fish (as described). It was again buried in more tempura crumbs than fish. The food was not worth the price we paid.   Maybe the food quality was better for other Yelp reviewers, but our first visit was not good.   Overall, space was great but the food lacked a balance of essential ingredients."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant at the suggestion of a co-worker. And I must admit, I really like their sushi. It's very tasty & well made. I've had some sushi from other restaurants that as soon as you touch the sushi it falls apart. But their sushi is a tad more expensive than some places. Their Tofu dinner is also very delicious & a more reasonable price for the amount of food you get. The great thing about Kiyomizu is that they deliver & they have a loyalty system where if you buy X amount of meals you get discounts."}
{"text":"This place hit the nail on the head in every way. First of all, decor...I felt like I was in Japan. I have never been to Japan so this is probably not what it looks like at all, but this restaurant embodies what I, as an American, think it looks like: Bamboo colored wood, those paper window doors, paper lanterns, coi fish, etc., the servers even wore cute kimono inspired outfits. It was beautiful and really provided some serious sushi ambiance. Also, it was made for a date night, because all the booths are so private.   Second, service...both of the girls who helped us were super friendly. Our orders were accurate and came in a timely fashion. So that brings us to the sushi itself...it was great! Be warned that there is extra wasabi on the tuna sushi for some reason, I didn't mind, but it was a bit surprising. Everything we ordered was tasty, but the Sockeye salmon sushi special was the hands down winner for yumminess!   Icing on the cake: Complimentary ice cream in orange or green tea flavor. Hooray!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Koyomizu very often when I lived in the neighbourhood. I visited this place again after a decade; the management seems to be changed because I remember they used to serve banchan and not anymore.   Two stars mainly because of the poor service and average food.   My group arrived way before two other group, but they received tea and even salad way before us. The staff only left us the menu and left; we waited for at least 15 minutes before we waived to get the staff attention to make our order. One girl told us to wait and another girl came to serve us. We told the waitress we didn't get any attention and she didn't even apologize for the slow service. The restaurant is half full and understaff with two servers. The service was very cold overall: they never asked how everything was.   Food also came pretty slow. We at least waited 10 minutes in between the Miso and salad. The sushi sashimi boat portion is small for $45 compare to other places. Fish's freshness was okay; the sushi rice was too hard. I enjoyed the special rolls among all the sushi.   We also order the Katsudon; the rice was hard as well and the pork Katsu was dry and hard. My child didn't really enjoy it.   What an disappointment tonight and definitely will not come back."}
{"text":"Alas, Spring Garden Avenue. I wish I lived in the building across the street to have sushi whenever I pleased.  I've only been to Ichiban a few years back and from what I remember it was good as well.  After walking into Kiyomizu, it was decorated.. how you say Japanese? Very cute, and it was even cuter getting greeted immediately from a server dressed in a kimono. The selection was awesome- we opted for 2 maki and temaki sets (A & C), and the Tiger Roll (Tuna, Avocado, Cream Cheese, wrapped in Salmon). I'm always hesitant when it comes to cream cheese and fish but I've got to say the very subtle touch of it in this roll worked amazingly.  My set included california rolls, avocado rolls, and a salmon hand roll. I should've taken a better picture of the hand roll. It had the biggest portion of salmon. With each bite, came a huge portion of salmon. It was scrumptious!! Im used to those AYCE places where they stuff a mere slice into the handroll which is difficult to finish since 90% of it is rice.   We were so full that we declined the free ice cream dessert, and opted for sliced oranges.  Friendly service, and even more amazing food. I'm always a fan of leaving a restaurant and the entire staff thanks you. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite since three years ago.  Nice sushi and good udon.  With mu fiancé tonight, we had sushi menu c and a udon and it was enough for us.  All together around $38."}
{"text":"I came for takeout and their sushi was alright. The seaweed that wrapped around the sushi was a bit chewy and some pieces were quite big to fit into one bite.  The service was quite good and polite, but the wait was a bit long."}
{"text":"Just had some delivery from this place. If you order above $35 they don't charge delivery fee. What I had: Boston roll, Philadelphia rolls, Tempura rolls, miso soup, wakame salad and edemame. The delivery guy got lost, but after calling my cell a couple of times he finally made it to my door. Was the food good you ask? yeah, it was alright. It wasn't fantastic, but just good enough to leave me without any  complaints. Miso soup and wakame salad are pretty much the same anywhere you go. Their edemame had no salt surprisingly. The rolls were just what you expect to get at almost any decent sushi place. I think next time I'll just go there in person to pick up, so I don't have to order extra."}
{"text":"DO order the rolls and the sashimi, the fish tastes fresh and you get good value for the price paid.  DON'T order the salmon teriyaki, it was underwhelming and dry. You're better off ordering something else.   Overall a good experience since the sashimi was done really well and the staff there were so friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I was told once that a sushi experience happens at the sushi bar. Here the delicate cuts to the fish can be seen and the recommendations by the chef can be made. KiyomiZu does not provide this experience.   Kiyomizu won me over by having good reviews and while their service and fish quality was excellent I would rate this place 3 stars as the Toro sushi I ordered wasn't spectacular.   Would I return: Yes Bill w/tx&tip for one: $40"}
{"text":"Kiyomizu is another Japanese restaurant that owns by Korean in the area.  Lunch specials on Monday - Thursday starting at $6.95 for sure is a great value.. Fridays are $1 more ..which I don't mind paying! :)  Sushi Lunch A ($7.95) - 6 pieces of nigiri sushi and 6 pieces of avocado roll and a chicken yakitori - The fish is really thinly cut with a little ball of rice.. I don't expect much for $8 so I am not complaining - the chicken yakitori served steaming hot! fogging up my camera.. the sauce is a little sweet, but the chicken was nice and moist  Kiyomizu seems to be really popular with the office workers in the area during lunch time, every tables were occupied by the time I left. And a lot of people ordering takeout too!  Service here is A-OK... Though I was seated at the sushi bar but far away from the 2 sushi chefs who were so busy the whole time I was there!"}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place in Toronto. Authentic, fresh, DELICIOUS, friendly.... This is where I go when I want good sushi, and it's at sheppard !   They have incredible special roles, and their normal maki rolles use extremely fresh fish. When you order a piece of sushi, you get a huge piece of fish with a TINY piece of rice.   I can't say enough good things about this place. Prices are a little more than average but it's because the quality is so much better. Special rolls are on average $12.00 but they're very filling so for some people one is enough.   I know my sushi...   Trust..   GO HERE ! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! Been there 3 times and I am pretty happy about their food and service! Staff are super nice and polite! Especially the sushi Chef! When you enter the restaurant almost all of the staff great u which for me is impressive!  The restaurant is cozy and well decorated!  I ordered Green Dragon (8pieces) and their special Kiyomizu roll first time! I was pretty happy about them which I order them again next 2 times ! Moreover the design of food is nice also!"}
{"text":"Hands down, without a doubt, the BEST tempura in the city. The rest of the food is great too, but if you're having any trouble ordering, get the tempura. JUST DO IT!"}
