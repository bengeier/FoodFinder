{"text":"Great unexpected discovery! We were looking for a quaint little resto in the area tonight, and happened to stumbled upon this place. Super happy we did! 

The pho hit the spot with its delicious broth, tasty grilled chicken and fresh ingredients. We also tried the imperial rolls as well as the spring rolls, both excellent! 

I'd have to say what really stole the show though, was the lovely owner who went out of her way to make our experience delightful. She noticed I couldn't eat the raw sprouts, so she offered to cook them for me. She also offered me extra broth with my doggy bag. 

We'll definitely be back next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"We order from here all the time! The pad thai is amazing!!!! Also im a big fan of the chicken pho, it comes all separate so I usually make 2 meals of the medium size. My favorite asian restaurant in the area by far :)"}
{"text":"I've only tried this restaurant once and it was a very good experience. 4 stars after one visit is high, but I gave it because it is new and it is worth trying. It seems very family run, then kids sit in the restaurant and the waitress is passionate by her food offerings. I didn't try the Pho but I had the spicy Hoa soup and enjoyed it. The spring rolls we're very fresh and the service was very good. I will return and I will try the Pho and the Banh Mi sandwiches. And so should you. Enjoy."}
