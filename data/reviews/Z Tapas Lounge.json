{"text":"we found message of this restaurant from the website of foodfestival in Montreal and come from Quebec by coach. but  this restaurant dont open, while the billboardin the frontdoor still said it open from8-23h today
we are so annoyed and disappointment."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 8.  We had a great meal - lots of variety.  The atmosphere was cool and mod.  Chic bathrooms.  Service was very good and friendly.  I'd go again."}
{"text":"Went a few months ago for a friends birthday. I wouldn't return or recommend this place. The food ranged from merely fine to poor. Cocktails were poorly made and really weak. Service was really amateurish."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch as a work group.  The interior is well designed, with purple tones.  Chairs are comfortable.  
The waiter was polite and efficient and staff was pleasant in general. 

I sampled the beef tartare with toasts and a salad. The meat was high quality filet mignon,  very tender although it didn't seem freshly made.  Seasoning included relish which gave it an overly sweet taste. 

Salad was ok but nothing too write home about.  Dressing was bland and leaves were not the freshest I have seen. 

We didn't have dessert or coffee so i can't comment on that. 

Considering the taste and the freshness of the ingredients,  I think that the 21$ price tag was a little too expensive for this lunch time meal."}
{"text":"Terrible experience!! My boyfriend came here for birthday and it was completely ruined because they advertised for the free birthday meal deal and we have brought the cake and finished singing. Waiter came and spoke in very rude manner like \"What are you doing? You are not supposed to eat what you bring here!\" We were all surprised and bf just had a really birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Honestly, the perfect place for a girls night out dinner. The ambiance is quite stylish and they have different specials every night (check out their website). It's mostly tapas style dinning and I find I get full when I order 2-3 dishes. The prices are moderate and the quality of the food is excellent. For me, the must tries would be the tartare and tomato soup."}
{"text":"Found this place online because we bought a coupon for oysters. New spot that opened up about 2 months ago.

Inside is gorgeous it as designed by a woman I was told by the waiter and you can tell with all the purple and sparkles and va va voom look.

Huge purple piano which is amazing.
The music is perfect 
And the waiter even Better.

The best part was the meat platter. I had loads of meat and a bunch of cheese. I was extremely happy with my
Pick. 

Everything we tried was awesome.
Not many places can make a great old fashion but they nailed it.

A must try :)"}
{"text":"Très bon accueil et service.
Tapas délicieux, mais un peu cher en terme de quantité/prix. Les portions sont très petites pour des prix autour de 10-14$. Les verres de vin sont autour de 8-10$.
Il y a une chanteuse ainsi qu'un piano, ce qui rend l'ambiance cozy et agréable.
Nous y sommes allés dans le cadre de Tartarefest, il y avait quand même pas mal de monde.
A essayer mais prévoir un budget.."}
{"text":"I was staying at Hotel Zero 1 in downtown Montreal and was a bit hungry and felt like a drink so I came down to the lobby to check out the tapas bar and wow it was great the food was Awsome as the drinks and service was pleasant I'd love to come back and definitely will !"}
{"text":"Food was really good, great tapas place. Awesome home made desserts. But the service was way too slow. My friend and I showed up at 5:15pm, the restaurant was pretty empty on a Friday night and it took over 2hrs to eat and leave. About 30 min passed between the end of our meal and someone coming by to pick up our plates and ask us if we wanted something else. Plus, they forgot to bring my dessert so we waited another 15 min after the manager realized it. He was very pleasant and apologetic, even brought some home made chocolate ice cream to say sorry. 

Based on food alone, I would go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Well.. 
Isn't tapas supposed to be bite sized 

Quite a nice decor. It's beautiful and cozy. 
The evening started with a tartare duo (duck and salmon) the duck on being way more refined. This alone was quite the copious entree. Next was a sopa de tortilla which was tasty but the avocado in it didn't quite work. Then was a croquette de bacalao and empanada picadillo. Again way better one (empanada) than the other. 
The next plate was a risotto. I was not as pleased as the rest. The risotto was grainy and hard.
Main plate was duck with beets and hazelnuts. The amarillo and feta mousse as accompagnement was fantastic But the duck was undercooked and quite greassy. 
The dessert was a good comeback with the delicious tres leche cake and creme brulee served on big plates."}
{"text":"Impressive cocktails, delicious oysters, tartar and carpacios to die for, this is an unbelievable find. Highly recommended and a fair price for what you get. Oh, and there's a dj :)"}
{"text":"Pros: great food, fresh, great service, reasonably priced, good atmosphere, clean. 

Cons: none"}
{"text":"Vendredi après-midi, début du printemps que de mieux pour un 5@7, malheureusement, la terrasse du Lab était full donc, nous nous sommes rabattus sur le plan B, essayer le nouveau Z Tapas Lounge dans le QdS, juste à côté. Bel accueil, y'avait du monde, une belle ambiance, décor chic avec ses chandeliers et fleurs exotiques, on a bien aimés. Clientèle 450 des bureaux d'à côté. Au niveau service, un peu confus et désorganisé, y'a eu pas moins de 5 personnes du staff qui sont venus pour nous servir et poser des questions pour simplement, notre commande, 2 verres + 1 plateau de charcuteries. La carte des cocktails signatures présente sur la table n'était au final pas encore prête pour être présenter pour les clients et a été retirer alors qu'on en avait commandé deux. Avons été terriblement déçus du plateau de charcuterie où on cherchait vraiment les morceaux car pour 16$, on s'attend à un peu plus. Y'a du avoir un problème avec la cuisine car une yelper (Amber) m'a fait remarqué que son plateau de charcuteries d'il y a quelques jours était vraiment rempli contrairement au notre (*voir sa photo et ma photo en comparaison*). Pas de modèle de nourriture et de stabilité ici ? Total de l'addition avec service/taxes pour 2 verres&plateau de charcuteries à moitié vide = 48$. À savoir, y'a une terrasse intérieure / Hôtel Zero 1. Je peux comprendre que ça vient d'ouvrir mais non, désolé, malheureusement, ma copine et moi, ne reviendront pas au Z Tapas Lounge. 

2/5 visité en mai 2016"}
{"text":"Service gentil et ambiance de bar chic. Musique forte et lumières de neon pour une soirée lounge avec des amis. Bouffe correcte."}
