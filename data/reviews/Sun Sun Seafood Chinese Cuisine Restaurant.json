{"text":"My trip to Toronto was a blur for the most part, since it mostly consisted of eating, shopping, eating, shopping, repeat 100x. Sun Sun Seafood particularly stood out because it was our first meal there and the worst dining experience during the days I was there. SSF is conveniently located inside the Mississauga Chinese Center, although it's pretty easy to overlook since it's on the top floor.

Dim sum was offered, but dim sum at 9pm on a Friday night just seemed rather inappropriate, so my parents and I opted for the regular menu instead. Seeing how seafood is part of the restaurant's name, both the seafood soup and a lobster were musts. The soup was flavorless, and a thick layer oil sitting at the top of the broth stared back at us. Needless to say, that pretty much was left untouched. Stir fried and with the right amount of sauce and spices (but drenched with oil), the lobster would have been decent had it not been a baby lobster. The same can be said about the duck that we ordered. The last time I checked bones and exoskeletons are inedible, so how the chef expects us to actually make a meal out of the aforementioned dishes is very well beyond me. The only a-okay dish of the night was the salt pepper pork chops.

As if the dining experience wasn't horrible enough, there was a huge party gathering in the dining room area for karaoke. The same guy was belting out tunes the entire time we were there. I still can't quite figure out if he's the only one singing because his buddies were vocally challenged, or if he was up on stage so his people could make fun of him. Seriously, if I were to get a dollar each time his voice cracked, I'd be a millionaire... all within a 60-minute time span. (There's a reason why Andy Lau's good at what he does. Just don't friggin butcher his songs like that. It's quite insulting, methinks.)"}
{"text":"So I'm a little Dim Sum obsessed.  It's hard to find Dim Sum around here, and we will drive all the way to Mississauga from Burlington just to get it. The restaurant is huge, and I have never had problems being seated right away.  It is the kind with the carts rolling by, which is handy for getting your food quickly, although when we go in the afternoon there is not always the selection (that is, the specific items) we want. I love the food, my one big complaint would be that the Dim Sum is only available until 2 or 3 in the afternoon, and sometimes it's hard to get there by that time on a busy weekend, so we don't go as often as I'd like.  The prices also seemed to have gone up recently.  The servers don't all speak English but you can generally point at what you want. I have never witnessed Karaoke as the one poster did, although I was impressed one year when we happened to be there around Chinese New Year and they had a \"dragon\" and drummers come through, that was a cool new experience for me.  This restaurant is one of my favorite places to go.

UPDATE - the restaurant is closed."}
