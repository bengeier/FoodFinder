{"text":"The menu items are great, I am just disappointed the main chef left. It's a good little deli & cafe though."}
{"text":"Saffron Deli and Cafe is closed. At this location there is now Alladin Mediterranean Restaurant. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I had the Gyro special and the portion size for the Gyro seemed pretty weak. I'll give this place another try since they just opened and are working out the kinks."}
{"text":"I tried the koubideh kabob..the seasoning was excellent and was very filling...im looking forward to trying the chicken kabob next time...there's quite a variety of gyros to choose from."}
{"text":"Now they separated the restaurant from market and both under new ownership  I walked in and walked out of the restaurant called Aladdin Mediterranean.  Gyros are grilled processed meat not from a real spit. Soda machine tasted awful.  Such a travesty that Caspian left us this."}
{"text":"Yuck -- the owner and everything else changed - it's called Alladdin or something like that now. Walked and right back out -- foods no good anymore..."}
{"text":"Lumpy hummus made with jalapeno & cilantro.  Very lumpy.  They were out of diet coke, and apparently I wasn't the first to discover this because they had the alternative of cans of Coke zero lined up for when customers complained.  Falafel were good, nice and green inside and filled with flavor.  Prices reasonable.  Close at 7pm though, so I guess they're aiming to be a lunch place."}
