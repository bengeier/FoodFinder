{"text":"Worst place I've ever been to in my life. THIS IS A GENTLEMAN'S CLUB. I took my wife for her birthday expecting a classy place with good food and got a gentle men's club with cold, nasty food. We left with Togo boxes 2 hours after we arrived. The only reason this has 1 star is because the manager TIM gave us a lift back to our hotel.  PLUS THEY DID NOT HONOR THE YELP 50% OFF. plus we paid a 70$ cover just to enter this establishment."}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent staff await you at this oasis in the desert. From the pick up to the drop off you will not be disappointed at how the staff goes above and beyond to ensure you have a true experience worth talking about with your friends."}
{"text":"Incredible Bone in Rib Eye. Potstickers. Mixed Veggies. Arguably the Best Steak I've ever tasted. Quality of Meat. 5 Star. Flavor. Texture. Temperature Delivery. Cici the waitress was so in tuned. She was the best waitress I ever ever experienced. We were having a business meeting and she flawlessly moved around important conversation with seamless n productive interaction.. Everyone should eat at this steak house. Age limit 21 plus tho lol"}
{"text":"Hmmm. Where does one start. A steakhouse attached to a strip club. After hearing about this place for ages, my friend was finally able to prove t me that the food  was actually pretty good. 

The steakhouse is a tiny little room. One does not see the dancers unless they are working the tables around you. Since their were three women at the table our table was not approached. 

Now to the important stuff. Cecilia was our
Server and she made the experience amazing. The food was amazing from the bread to the chocolate cake at the end. At our table we had steak, lamb and chicken. No one left the table hungry. The sides are huge and served family style. 

The doorman saw the books in my
Sister in law's bag and they had a nice discussion. Cecilia knew the others at our table so we were able to talk about families and how everyone has been. It was just an all around good experience."}
{"text":"Dont be afraid that the steakhouse is attached to a gentlemen's club, the dining room is in a separate area and this is a very legit steakhouse. Great steaks and sides await those who are willing to give this place a chance. Everything we had was phenomenal would recommend the ribeye and creamed spinach. 

Note there was no cover charge for the steakhouse and a great locals discount on the food and drinks."}
{"text":"Hands down this is the best lobster I have had.... EVER. And CECE... she is fantastic! Still here ... WOW! And free transportation so why wouldn't you come here? Stretched excursion limo... need I say more.  And if ur lady had issues... the \"club\" is in a separate area."}
{"text":"First the bread was AMAZING, we had the lobster bisque as an Appetizer...and it was DELICIOUS...Service was as expected in a steakhouse Great...we had the steak and lobster and salmon...Delicious and yummy, cooked the way we wanted it...Thank you!!!!! Will be coming back"}
{"text":"We literally come here for the lobster bisque and the badass service!..we love CeCe. The steaks are pretty good too!"}
{"text":"I love the design and Devore. Very comfortable.  Prices are comparable to Golden Steer but I think chef Patrick edges them out . I had the chicken Francese and it was the best breast I've had in town. The Steakhouse is separate from the club so you can relax. The bar has a big screen so I had a private showing for MNF. Great hideout if you find the right roads"}
