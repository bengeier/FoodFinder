{"text":"We agree that this is really good Mexican food.  Nothing fancy....just the way authentic Mexican food should be.  We had carne asada and carnitas tacos and a green chili beef burrito.  Excellent.  Very friendly (and fast) service.  Wish we lived closer but will definitely be back next time we need to go to Food City for their awesome house-made tortillas and salsas."}
{"text":"There breakfast burritos are so good ! The employees are so friendly!  Great customer service and great food"}
{"text":"Scum City around here. Burrito had a bunch of grisly food in it and seemed overpriced. Area is disgusting and people smoking on every corner, begging for money, etc."}
{"text":"Would've gotten 4 stars if I wasn't trampled when I entered the building. It's so cramped, I had to move around people 5 times just to order. I've tried most authentic mexican food places in the valley, and the burrito I got here was a bit underwhelming. I have lived in AZ my entire life and have had probably over 1000 burritos, this one was a 3/5."}
{"text":"Food was good, we ordered breakfast burritos, steak and eggs, and it was all tasty. The inside only has 5 tables so it's probably better for takeout. Staff was friendly and on top of things. Nothing really stood out for me that would make me go out of my way to come back here but it was good, glad I tried it."}
{"text":"Omelette ranchero is delicious. Chilaquiles are also really good. Prices are great, food is great. Wish they were open a little later. Great for breakfast and lunch!"}
{"text":"The food is so good here! It's authentic Mexican food. The staff is nice. It's a tiny place. There wasn't a lot of standing room but luckily no one else was ordering to-go except for me."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I always get the Arizona Burrito for breakfast. It is amazing. This place looks a little sketchy, some of the best foo comes from places like this. You have to try it!!!"}
{"text":"Thought we'd give it a try..... It was GREAT!!..... Can't believe we've been missing out all this time"}
{"text":"As Gabriel notes, don't let the trailer park in back fool you... 

It was a small restaurant with a few parking spots. I tried the barbacoa which was a first for me. \"About Food\" describes barbacoa as \"Traditional Mexican barbacoa is completely different. It essentially steams and smokes the meat at the same time resulting in a moist and flavorful meat.\" Excellent choice which included beans, rice and tortillas. Complementary hot sauce (red and green) and chips was included. The red was tasty with some kick, but the green was our favorite. 
The waiter was the son of the owner. He was extremely helpful in describing the different items on the menu. Also, the owner stopped by our table to talk about the history of the restaurant and her love of cooking."}
{"text":"I had to check this place out due to my absolute obsession with Mexican food and the overwhelming positive reviews it has received. Although it is a rather small establishment with few places to seat and the location seems to be questionable, don't fret for Adrian's is by far some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. The chile relleno is to die for!!! I'm definitely coming back again and again and again and again. The prices are very affordable as well!"}
{"text":"Alright East Siders! If you need beans on the fly and nanas not available.....Adrians is the spot! Most definitely the best beans in the east valley. Elmers can't swing a stick at Adrian's beans! I just drove all the way from Gilbert to get a 32 ounce cup of beans."}
{"text":"Everything I have ordered has always been amazing.  Staff is friendly.  Very small inside with a total of five tables so I usually order to go especially on weekends to avoid a wait time."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the valley IMO. This place is legit. Even the refried beans are amazing. The family that runs this place is super friendly and the service is always prompt. The cheese enchilada is amazing and I've never gotten too excited about a cheese enchilada."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here a few years back, and I have to say I was a little skeptical at first. There is very little seating inside but don't let that deter you from ordering! Staff is friendly and the burritos...Oh the burritos! I have not had a better breakfast burrito anywhere else but being a creature of habit I have yet to stray from the 'Special Burrito' (it's just so dang good!) Not to mention their salsa is to die for! Five stars all around, do not pass this place up!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food at a reasonable price. Family owned and operated, Andy, the waiter provides excellent service and their green chili burrito is awesome! Try it out next time you're in the area."}
{"text":"Love their food.  I had the Mole chicken and flan for dessert.   Both we're homemade and tasted incredible.  My son loves their Chile Relleno with rice and beans.   The portions are large and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This is definitely some of the best Mexican food this Texan / Californian / Arizonan has had anywhere. The green chile beef and chicken mole were outstanding. Even the coffee was scrumptious! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Hubby said, the enchiladas and beans remind him of  Nana's\"!  Tiny hole in the wall, great, friendly service!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to this little restaurant for years now. They never change! The food is always great and the service is exceptional! Definitely try the Agua de Pina (Pineapple juice) and the Chorizo con Huevo! Its sooo good!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and the food is always amazingly good!!! The menudo is bomb every single breakfast plate is delicious and the pancakes omg so good! I highly recommend this place definitely real Mexican food. What I love the most is that everyone there is very friendly."}
{"text":"Had the chorizo, egg, cheese and potato burrito. Really good! Came with red and greed sauce. Guys even brought out some of there there red and green verde for me to try. The Arizona burrito seems to be one of the biggest hits here. Got here with only one other patrons sitting inside the small five table establishment, left with a line out the door. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Oh wow. That's real Mexican place. The food I had was great. The salsa was hot enough to burn through the table, since I specifically asked for the extra spicy one - was not disappointed :-)"}
{"text":"We read the reviews decided to give it a try this sure wasn't a disappointment... great customer service the food was outstanding. Not a fancy place but it was clean and authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place has awesome food! The owner is the nicest guy around and takes a lot of pride in what he does! Can't believe he's been in business here for 19 years and I just discovered this place. So far I have tried the green and red burittos and both are very delicious. Every time I come in he gives me a sample of something else. Carnitas was the last sample and that is going to be what I will have on my next visit! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"While in Phoenix visiting from Fort Lauderdale, I went with a friend to this terrific Mexican place. She was unaware of it and not surprising since you could easily miss it if you did not know of it. The food was really delicious. I had the chicken flauta which was perfection. My friend had the bean and cheese burrito. She really liked it. We shared an avocado and bean tostada. Delicious. What was so impressive was how the waiter took time to really accommodate us. My friend has some food allergies that had to be considered and I wanted a flauta that was crispy on the outside but also moist and flavorful on the inside. All issues satisfied! This is well worth going to for in or out ordering. Friendly service and delicious food."}
{"text":"what a hidden gem in downtown mesa.I'm from Mexico and this food tasted just like my Grandma's.I have the birria plate(goat  stew) and the flavor was just right. Beans are goooood  and the rice was perfectly cooked. Definitely will be back. Muchas gracias estuvo muy rico !!!!"}
{"text":"awesome spot.  was in town on vacation.  had breakfast here 5 days in a row!"}
{"text":"I visited this place while I was staying with my inlaws.  I just had a breakfast burrito togo and my 2 year old daughter had a burrito with nothing in it.  AKA a tortilla.  It was solid and hit the spot.  The salsa was also good.  This is coming from an Albuquerque kid that knows his breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Great food!  Hot and full of flavor!  We had the chile relleno burrito and the chicken mole. Both were excellent!  Prices were great and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Small place that's great for take out. The staff was really nice! I ordered a potato, egg and cheese burrito. The tortilla was really fresh which was a nice surprise! The burrito was full of flavor and both red and green sauces are on point! I will definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"Very good authentic cheap mexican food. Great hole in the wall type of place. Only 5 tables. Tacos and carnitas were very good and the wife loved the relleno. Will be back."}
{"text":"Iv had a lot of breakfast burritos in the valley but nothing touches Adrians hands down the best in town."}
{"text":"Great food!  Their chicken flautas are the best.  They have really tasty beans, unlike most places.  Their tortillas are good too.  I've also tried their mole which is really good but it's a whole piece of chicken which you have to debone so it gets messy.  The chorizo and enchiladas are good too.  Actually, I've never had one bad thing here.  A definite must go.  The building and area is off putting but they're clean inside.  You park at the entry of a trailer park.  Oh, they also have weird hours and close at 5pm most days."}
{"text":"Entered a freestanding shack with posters & coolers in front of the windows. Opened the door to a cozy & clean dining area with folk photos on the walls & 2 fans thrumming the comfortable air. 
Ordered my preferred breakfast burrito: Chorizo, Egg, Potato, & Cheese from a smiling man who jumped to making it. Less than five minutes later he returned & offered hot or mild sauce, I went hot all the way and took the substantial burrito to go. We chatted about the summer season when business lags due to the heat. He wished me well with a smile. 
Sat down with an Iced Coffee to ingest this Mexican delight. It was way bigger than a hotdog in a bun & weighs at least  1/2 a pound. The fresh tortilla was slightly crispy & well wrapped. The Chorizo & Eggs were perfectly cooked together with home made potatoes mixed in. It tasted rich but not greasy. The hot sauce was & I used both mini cups. It was so tasty & filling that I am amazed that I had to add a tip to spend $5. I will find a reason to return to Adrian's for breakfast or lunch, soon!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat - area a little dicey however the food and service are great!"}
{"text":"Amazing my husband and I both got Arizona burritos! It was fresh and delicious. My kids shared a quesadilla and they loved the green salsa. For once my 2 year old finished her food! My 4 year old finished off my husbands burrito and he loved that too. 5 stars"}
{"text":"Love this place, great home made Mexican food in a place that is quant and would be considered a hole in the wall that you would pass up because of the neighborhood and the looks of the place. Don't pass it up,stop for the breakfast burritos, yummy or the chili rellano and of course the tortilla chips and salsa. Be sure to try the homemade flan and the horchata."}
{"text":"I've eaten in expensive Mexican food restaurants all around the valley as well as hole in the wall places. And nothing compares to Adrian's. Hands down the best Mexican food and for the price. I come here all the time. Super small but has that authentic feeling to it. If your a sucker for a good breakfast burrito come here. Love this place and will continue to come here until I move."}
{"text":"This little family-owned and operated Mexican restaurant is not fancy on the outside - but will make your tummy VERY Happy on the inside!!  
The food was incredibly delicious, and home-made on the spot.  
The family members are gracious and warm, and make you feel like you have been invited into their home kitchen. As far as I'm concerned, It is their home kitchen!   :-) 
I found the preparations very different than typical, and the taste was the best I've had.  
I will go back whenever I am in Mesa, AZ - and plan my hunger accordingly!!  
Breakfast and lunch only - they closed at 4 pm when I was there in February."}
{"text":"Great service, quality, and price!  Will definitely be back!  We tried the carnitas plate and Barbacoa burrito.  Both were delicious."}
{"text":"This place lived up to the hype and the ratings. The owner was friendly and let me sample the green chilli and red chilli witch were amazing . The barbecoa was really really good too might be my favorite .  Next time im trying a deep fried arizona burrito enchilada style though lol  ill be back sooner than later !!"}
{"text":"If you like delicious tortillas and well priced breakfast burritos, then this is the place for you. My wife, daughter and I found this spot and we stopped in for breakfast burritos. Not large in size, but filling, tasty and great quality. This place is run with love and it comes out in their food. The beans are out of this world and you can't go wrong with any choice of burrito. By the way, did I mention that the restraint was clean and tidy and the staff was incredibly nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor. Drive past fili b's and come here. It's homemade and fresh. The food is great! The staff was really friendly and attentive. Really a wonderful dining experience all together. If you can't appreciate the adventure of visiting a restaurant that's in an old building around the wrong part of town, then you're missing out on the some of the most authentic food out there."}
{"text":"We've been in the area visiting and just found this little jem, the food is awesome the wait staff and cook are especially welcoming. The place is easily passed up it's  a small place but well worth the time. well definitely go back before we leave. Try the asadas"}
{"text":"We visited Adriana after searching Yelp and seeing the great scores and reviews and it did not disappoint.   I had the carnitas and the meat was roasted to perfection,  flavorful and moist. My husband had the tamale, enchilada and Carne Asad taco combo.   All wonderful and well done.   So glad to fine tune place of we lived here we would be regulars."}
{"text":"Just had the chorizo breakfast burrito, so good! He makes the chorizo in house. Must get the hot sauce with it"}
{"text":"I opened the door and a saw a fly in the kitchen. The utensils used to prepare the food for lying on a dirty table. I wasn't about to try their food."}
{"text":"C & E
A 20 seat tiny place.  You better be ready to hear everybody else's conversation and them yours .  Yum yum yum!  Breakfast burrito egg, potatoes, bacon awesome.  Tortilla freshly made.  Both green and red salsa great."}
{"text":"1st time visiting... amazing food!! Most everything (even rice and beans) is home made.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"This is as authentic as it gets, family run business with Adrian himself cooking up truly awesome Mexican dishes for you to enjoy. Just as he's been doing for over 20 years.  Service was prompt and attentive, delivered by the son. 
Where did I find this original?  Thank you Yelp !"}
{"text":"I had the Birria de chivo(goat) in stew. It was so good hit the spot I hadn't had that in years and it's not easy finding places who serve this. Oh and they serve it 7 days a week not like other places who only make certain things on weekends only. The place felt at home reminded me of my mom cooking in the kitchen when I walked in so it was truly comfortable. The guy who takes your order is great as well as the rest of the staff. Friendly service overall. I will definitely be going back to try all their other dishes. Only thing is that it's a small place so if it gets packed there might be a wait to get a table to sit but you can always get to go!"}
{"text":"Adrian's is a hidden gem. I've been working in Mesa, near this restaurant,  for nearly 20 years and only recently dicovered it. Family owned and operated with amazing food. Authentic Mexican. The owners are super friendly and really appreciate their customers. They also put a lot of pride in their food. If you are going through Mesa or live nearby and have not tried them, I highly recommend them. I especially like their breakfast plates. The machaca and eggs are great!"}
{"text":"Ambiance - crowded on a Sunday morning, but it was a very short wait to get 3 breakfast burritos and a horchata. Tortillas were amazing, we got chorizo, eggs, and potato with sour cream and guacamole. The burrito was very big and filling. Horchata is creamy and delicious. Only drawback, there is no where to sit if it's busy, however, the food came out fast so that's not much of an issue. Green sauce is lacking spice but the red sauce was bold and spicy, just the way it should be. Definitely coming back here to try more off the extensive menu!"}
{"text":"We chose Adrian's for breakfast because of the great rating and it didn't disappoint! The food was authentic and delicious! I ordered the chilaquiles and it was amazing. The sauce was tasty. I would definitely go back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Continuously impressed by this establishment.  Whether you come for breakfast or lunch, the food is always fantastic.  As it turns out Adrian's has been at this location for quite a long time, it was yelp that brought us in there for breakfast one morning.  We have been back 5 times since in the last 6 months.  Its quite a drive for us, but well worth it when you have a craving for some good Mexican food.  I would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Authentic as Nana's cooking!
The tacos come with tortillas made from scratch and while speaking with the waitress she stated that every sauce, salsa, and dish is made from 100% scratch and by hand!!!
I will admit I was hesitant because of the appearance, but the food definitely made up for it 100 times over.

  The place is small, quaint, but I am telling you the food makes up for it all.
 I tried the Barbacoa tacos and chicken caldo/soup and recommend them both.
  OH the beans are delicious and rice is very good as well!"}
{"text":"This was excellent Mexican food.  Was iffy at first, parking lot was empty, seemed like a dive, but walked in and place was full.  Only has about 8 tables, but service is quick.  My wife and I split 5 tacos (asada, barbacoa, chicken, lengua, carnitas) and a tamale.  Served with cilantro and onion on top, simple, but great depth of flavors from slow cooking meats."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Definitely a home in the wall, but the food was great.  They also had homemade horchata, very tasty. Service was fast, as I was on my lunch break.  I will be going back.  Need to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent place, nice owner.  Came by here yesterday after thinking about the good reviews I had read here.  The owner was super nice and friendly and I had me a delicious carne asada burrito and some chips to go.

It was like a home cooked meal and very simple and fresh.  Inexpensive and delicious, what more can you ask for.  I don't like the construction on Main Street but what can you do.  It's not going away, and somehow businesses are still able to keep going.  

I would like to try the breakfast menu and will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"The food was awesome. We had carne asada burrito, chicken enchiladas and tamale. All were superb. The chips and salsa were hot and fresh. Don't let the location dissuade you from stopping. You'll be glad you stopped."}
{"text":"Good food, had the chili rellano, was very tasty.  The red table salsa is nice and spicy.  Small inside so don't plan on bringing 20 people and having seating.  Best suited for take out. ."}
{"text":"Small place. I has second thoughts when I walked in but decided to give it a try. Best decision ever! I loved the food and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We got the special, number 1 (cheese enchiladas,  tamales, and a taco) and everything was absolutely amazing!!! The place is small but we didn't have to wait for a table and the service was fast."}
{"text":"The best I have had in years. Been here all my life and really have neen discouraged over all the bad Mexican food. Finally!!!! Great, polite, and yummy. Don't be turned off by the exterior.....and the small dining area. Alot of people picking up carry out and all looked and were treated like regulars. Can't wait to go again. Large varity on the menu too! Seafood also."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 20+ years - since high school. I now live on the other side of the country but STILL come when I'm in town. Family-owned. Amazing food. Fantastic."}
{"text":"Verry good. Small family place. Excellent service. Excellent value.  Had a combination plate that was a winner.  Would have liked onions in my enchiladas, but overall very good.  Beans (a great indicator) were spot on.

Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Had the Machaca with eggs for breakfast. It looked like a hash, and tasted great! Small dining area and they close early, but the staff is friendly and the food was good. I particularly enjoyed the refried beans and the seasoning on the breakfast potatoes. The salsa was also flavorful. I spooned it on everything."}
{"text":"I'm preaching to the choir on how great this place is!  If you like flavor as I do, then this is your place.  If you like a personable owner who's been in business now for 20 years, then this your place!  The Carne Asada is top notch, the beans have a wonderful Smokey flavor and creamy texture!  The Red Salsa is definitely hot, but in a very good way!  This place has stood the test of time!  If you really have a clue what true Mexican Food is supposed to taste like, then this is your place!"}
{"text":"great value. i left stuffed. everything is so authentic and affordable. i especially loved the horchata and the meat was all incredibly cooked"}
{"text":"What a find! I stumbled across Adrian's when I Yelped \"homemade tortillas\". I was looking for a good breakfast burrito. This place is small and tucked away but the food is amazing! More importantly, the staff is fantastic. The owner kept bringing samples of food for us to try so now I have a list of things I have to go back and try. I have never been a menudo fan despite my love of Mexican food, but I left there with a to go bowl of menudo. They clean it super well so it doesn't have that smell, and if you're anything like me the smell is what kills it for me. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Small hidden treasure off of Alma School and Main St. . Don't plan on eating here as it is quite small and this place packs in a crowd
 But completely worth getting the breakfast specifically burritos to go! Machaca buritto flavor and tenderness unlike I've ever had. Fresh, homemade tortillas and each burrito made to order on the spot. Just fantastic! I'll need to go back to try their lunch options next!"}
{"text":"Took one bite of my breakfast burrito and knew I would be back. Best horchata I've had around here. Great prices!"}
{"text":"Breakfast.  Chorizo and egg burrito was great.  Mucho Grande.  You can really see and taste that they make there own chorizo.  There hot salsa is one of the best I have tasted in a long time.  Stop by and check out this little shack in Mesa."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place we look for when we are in a town we aren't familiar with.  Based on Yelp reviews, and in the mood for Mexican breakfast late in the morning, we drove from East Mesa to Adrian's and we weren't disappointed.  My husband loves Hoeuvos Rancheros and is difficult to impress but he was very happy with his breakfast and cleaned the plate.  I had a carne asada tostada and rice and they were great.  The carne asada is flavorful with lots of grilled char and the rice was fluffy and melt in your mouth good.  The tostada came with two crispy tortillas instead of the usual one and they both stayed crispy till the last bite.  We split a homemade flan to top off the meal and it was fantastic.  
I had a bottled in Mexiico Coke and it was icy cold and so much better than the stuff in cans...I think it's because it's made with cane sugar.    
It's a shame they don't serve beer with their excellent menu but that's no reason not to eat there.  
The restaurant is small but quaint and clean and just the kind of place I hope to find again and again in our RV travels."}
{"text":"Found this place near our hotel and have a great dishes in the chocolate eggs for Charter in a piña nice and clean lovely service come back soon. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Smallest hole in the wall I've seen. They have 5 tables, and if order to go- you wait outside. Food took a while, but it's cooked to order. It's like going to a friend's house for lunch, if your friend was Mexican and his family was making the lunch. Tried the huevo's rancheros and the chorizo, potatoes, and egg burrito. It was excellent! 
There is no place more authentic and traditional than this place. I just wish it was bigger and had more tables. Next time I'm going to call ahead to cut down the wait. Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Super tiny but super delicious. Feels like you're in your great aunt's kitchen eating the best home-cooked Mexican food. Seats less than 20 people at a time, so be prepared to wait. It's worth it, though."}
{"text":"My sister turned me on to Adrian's years and years ago. We've been going ever since. Typically I order ahead and just pick up as they only have 5 tables for seating."}
{"text":"Don't blink or you'll miss this little gem. It's tiny inside but the staff is very friendly and the food is delicious. I ordered the Arizona burrito dairy free and it was huge! It had carne Asada, rice, beans, cilantro, potatoes. It was like it was homemade the quality was excellent!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food!  The Green Chile is homemade and the reason I drove 6 miles.  Breakfast is also stupendous.  The prices are so cheap I typically tip 50% because they deserve it.  Literally hands down best mexican food I have had in Arizona. Dont judge a book by its cover.  The outside is no ritz but the ritz could learn a thing or two from the chef."}
{"text":"First time here, definitely coming back! I had the machaca with corn tortillas and red sauce, very tasty."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this little spot. Took my daughters for lunch takeout. The Burrito  and tacos  hit the spot. The red salsa is nice and spicy . I will try it again hopefully for breakfast"}
{"text":"I seriously wish that I could add a sixth star.   The place is certainly nothing to look at, and, as others have mentioned before, it is located in front of a trailer park.  

Don't let the outside appearance fool you.  The food, service and overall experience is out of this world.  

We had the Enchiladas swissas, chile relleno, enchiladas regulares, and several types of tacos.  The food was outstanding.  

I will definitely be back many times in the near future."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years! Absolutely love it! Best menudo in town, best breakfast burritos in town. Best everything! Even for such a small restaurant, they certainly know how to create amazing dishes and they are very nice! They are always welcoming. Try the menudo! It's so good!"}
{"text":"Cheap,friendly,clean and awsome food. Carne asada burrito was awsome. The beans had por kfat in them. Just like mom use to make."}
{"text":"Tried a chile verde breakfast burrito with potatoes and scrambled eggs and refried beans. The chile verde was VERY dry, no sauce whatsoever and if it's even possible the beans were dry. The potatoes weren't potatoes, but fries that were old tasting even though the entire burrito was very hot. Tortilla tastes very good like it was homemade, but still very disappointing. I rather have a Bobby Salazar's burrito or stop at Zamora's Mexican Food."}
{"text":"Love this place. Everyone is very friendly, the food is fabulous, and it is a quaint place.  Don't be put off by the exterior. We go for the food. Definitely worth trying"}
{"text":"Not sure why haven't done a review on this place. My wife and I have been ordering and picking up from here for about a year now. So often she is getting tired of burritos. But not me!!! I LOVE this place. Just pick something, anything!! It's all good. My favorite is the special burrito for breakfast. We have ordered it probably twice a month for the last year. We get it with rice and beans on the side and they are both delicious as well. I love their red salsa too. Compliments the special burrito so well. Just go here you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Had the special breakfast burrito and horchata. Burrito was great and the horchata was some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Awesome little place with authentic breakfast burritos.  Went here because of the ratings - they were right.  Worth the effort!  Chorizo and egg was perfect!  A great little place!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and my boyfriend and I just found this place this morning. Our new breakfast burrito spot. We just got a basic breakfast burrito with, eggs, potatoes, bacon, and cheese. Our burritos weren't greasy at all, which is a big plus. Their red salsa was spicy and addicting. Glad I found this place, for a tasty breakfast burrito on a nice weekend morning."}
{"text":"Just great food.  Their red chile burritos are so good I can't bring myself to order anything else .  Got to stop doing that..."}
{"text":"I was in the area for work and was craving Mexican food, so I went on here to look for a place near by. I saw the reviews and decided to check Adrian's out. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They let me have a taste of a couple different meats so I could decide which I liked the most. Once I had picked out my meal the food was delivered almost immediately and was absolutely delicious. If you are in the area, I would definitely recommend checking this place out!!"}
{"text":"This place is a whole in the wall with fresh fresh fresh made food!!!!! Saw the reviews and had to try it out. Its now my favorite Mexican food place in the valley now!!! Good job"}
{"text":"When I'm driving through a town and see a hole in the wall Mexican restaurant with over 100 five star reviews, I gotta go. We got Arizona burritos with carne asada and chicken mole.  Perfect with a Mexican Coke. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"The green chile beef and machaca/eggs were both outstanding! It's a little dive hole that you could easily miss but once you walk in, you know that you have arrived at the right place for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"I Love Mexican Food comming from California I grew up enjoying Mexican food and when I tell this is best I have since moving to AZ. Four years ago. This place is by far the BEST! If you haven't stopped by you're mos definitely missing out."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food. Mom and Pop hole in the wall. Inexpensive and super delicious. Best chicken tacos I've had!"}
{"text":"This place is a total hole in the wall, but the food is really good.  The carne asada burrito is excellent and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"What a great place!! Wonderful family serving wonderful homemade food. Huge portions and great prices. You're missing out if you don't give this place a try. Boyfriend and I got an Arizona burrito enchilada style and machaca with eggs, both were insanely delicious. Fresh horchata is excellent too."}
{"text":"I can't believe I found this place after I moved to the east coast:(. This is exactly what I was looking for: affordable, simple, standard Mexican breakfast options including chorizo plates and burritos, huevos rancheros, and great American breakfast deals. The tortillas were great! I loved the salsa. They also have horchata and piña that looked yummy. I'll have to come by next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This place has a little bit of a sentimental value for me since I have been eating at this establishment since I was sixteen years old.  Adrian's is a tiny little piece of Mexican food haven right off Main St. in downtown Mesa and if you're driving to fast you might just miss it.  You walk in and there is maybe eight tables to choose from but well worth the wait if there is one.  I used to go in on Saturday mornings after a rough Friday night and have their chorizo burrito to make me feel all better.   The service is fantastic and the owner is a true artist in the kitchen.  Sadly a little while back I moved far away from Adrian's but I still catch myself dreaming of their amazing green chili and Mexican coke-colas.  Adrian's is an inexpensive treat and I miss it so much just writing this review makes me want to travel across the Valley to go get some."}
{"text":"So, looking to grab some lunch after a class at Mesa Arts Center today - spotted Adrian's on the local search - 85 reviews - 5 stars - sounds promising...

We navigated our way to the restaurant (a little challenging thanks to the light rail, but well worth the detour!). 

We spotted the sign, and pulled in, parked, and walked in.

I decided to try the Chile Rellenos, while my son went for the Chicken Mole.
The rellenos were really good - lightly battered, cooked to perfection, and tasty as all get out!
I'm not usually a fan of mole, but I snagged a bite off my son's plate - it was also really great.
And did I mention the savory refried beans???

This is a great place to grab some Mexican food - worth the journey - give them a go!!!"}
{"text":"Burritos no son aburridos
This is one cheap burrito place. For $6 you get a carne asada burrito. What else can I ask. The place looks sketchy but those are where they sell good food. Plus, there are customers. I wouldn't come to a sketchy place without customers

Taste? The burrito has extra beans in it. I like how it is not spicy because I'm not a spicy person. There isn't a condiment bar though, what if I want onions, extra salsa, beets, I cannot get them here

Price? Like I said. Cheap is what matters

Service? Nice service. Asked me what I wanted in my burrito instead of assuming. Food is served fast"}
{"text":"Decent food not worth the hype. Location of restaurant is a little odd but not a deal breaker, the decision to not do anything about the appearance inside is a deal breaker. Food and prices are standard, in an area with a ton of options for Mexican food not sure how this location makes it to the top."}
{"text":"Little place with authentic Mexican food, only 5 tables seating 20 guests. Great carnitas burrito, carne asada tacos, refried beans are very good too. Try homemade flan for desert. Mexican sodas and canned pop for the gringos."}
{"text":"Recently went here I enjoyed it highly it's a little hole in the wall but worth it.
Very limited sitting but if you call ahead you can take it to go! 
As a Mexican this is pretty right on!!"}
{"text":"Another 5 star review.  This was a great authentic meal.  Great service.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This us the best Mexican food I have ever eaten. Its authentic and the staff is wonderful as well. Definitely coming back and recommending to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Found this place this morning wanting some home made-style mexican breakfast.  Best chilaquiles in town. Big portion of chilaquiles, eggs, beans and steak. Also had carne asada burrito and taco de barbacoa. Tastes just like home. Price was reasonable,  paid $21for the whole meal including 2 drinks, horchata and pineapple."}
{"text":"Best hole in the wall place for authentic Mexican food in Phoenix! It doesn't look like much when you drive up (Goolgemaps actually says it's closed, and it does look like they're shut down but they're not!), but everything on their menu is incredible! They don't have much seating it's so small, but they are fast for take out. Their busy hours are actually in the morning if you don't want to wait. Really friendly staff who make amazing food, love it!"}
{"text":"I'm from Virginia and 2 out of the 3 times I have been to the Phoenix Mesa area I have stopped at Adrian's, a place highly recommended by the locals. Great food every time and staff is extremely friendly! Great things come in small packages! Make sure you get a large glass of horchata!"}
{"text":"friendly service, awesome atmosphere, and rocking food. 
friend had lengua taco and#5 chicken enchilada.  quote \"delicious\"
i had chile relleno burrito: mild taste inthe come (someone chiles area bit bitter. not here. just good), but a bit of a kick"}
{"text":"Heard about this place through an email I received from Only in your state.  It was titled 10 restaurants  under the radar that are Scrumdiddlyumtious.  Decided to try it and was not disappointed. I had a shredded beef burrito and it was delicious. The best one I've ever had. My friend had the taco, tamale, enchilada plate. When she was finished the plate was clean.  Service was great. Talked with a gentleman I believe was the owner.  He and everyone else we spoke with couldn't have been nicer. We are going back to try breakfast and would definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"The food is good and yes if people look at the outside and get turn off for not being up to par then this is not your place. It's like the old saying never judge a book by its cover. I recommend trying something different. Don't go in there ordering a breakfast burrito and expect to be the best you ever tasted. Go outside the box and try a new food."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service and the fact that the place was full was a good indication our dining experience was going to be positive...And it was."}
{"text":"A little dive in Mesa. Small dining room, even smaller staff, but AMAZING food! The owner is the chef and he makes authentic Mexican food. The huevos rancheros are to die for and worth eating for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Not a great to go option. But their burritos are great too. Not HUGE like some other places do. This burrito is a regular reasonable one person size burrito! Carne Asada with some guac on the side!"}
{"text":"This place has never let me down. Good food, good price. Don't let the location fool you, and if you have a large party get the order to go. This place is a favorite on days off for lunch together. I've never had a bad meal here. When you walk inside, you may be thrown off by the interior, but honestly, I've seen worse."}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap. Rice was the exception - kind of bland - but the chicken burrito I had was awesome as were the beans.  I would stop here again."}
{"text":"I haven't been back to my good ol' hometown of Mesa, AZ for a while now. I always make a point of visiting family-owned Mexican food places to get the most authentic Mexican food I can. After a quick Google search, I found Adrian's and was not disappointed. Their breakfast burrito with egg and beans was less than $4 and blew me away. My favorite parts in order were: the hot sauce (of which they gave me 3 small cups for my one burrito), the tortilla, and the beans. Next time I come back home, I'll be visiting Adrian's again."}
{"text":"Dive place on dive street in dive area.  Surrounded by cheap motels, thrift shops, and mobile homes.  If you go out of your way to come here - you are a fool!  Food is ordinary.  Red chile beef burrito, rice+ beans = $7.87 incl tax.  No freebie chips.  Owner's family (a man plus three little kids - who all walked in/out of the kitchen and helped themselves to whatever) occupied one of the five tables when I arrived circa 11:30 am.

My shredded beef burrito was okay at best.  If you rave about this coffee-shop style cooking - you have different standards than I.  I found both this place and the general area unpleasant.  Pass."}
{"text":"Finally found what I was looking for. Had my fav weekend breakfast spot in Texas, and now found it in AZ."}
{"text":"Absolutely, positively do not judge this eatery by it's outward appearance or surroundings! This place is incredible. Had attempted to stop in twice before, unfortunately they were closed. The 3rd time was definitely the charm. I had the chicken mole, by which I judge most of my Mexican restaurants. It was so flavorful, with a perfect blend of chocolate and cinnamon for the mole. And, the mole is made from scratch, no package mixture used here. My wife had the chicken soup which was incredibly flavorful. The soup was full of chicken and fresh vegetables. Everyone was incredibly social and warmly received us. We shall return!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now. 

I must say this place is pretty good! I've always done take out for lunch (carne asada burrito) and my co worker gets the carne tacos (which she says is bomb) lol. 

The cashier is always friendly and the business seems to always have customers. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for some Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Good spot for breakfast burritos. As others have stated parking is very, very, very, very tight lol I have a truck and it was difficult to say the least. However they are located near (practically in) a mobile home park so perhaps you can find parking there? The restaurant (I hesitate to call it one) is SO...small... like I had to go back outside and sit in my truck to wait for my order, kind of cramped. 
Now on to the food (: the burritos really hit the spot! Knowing Mexican food well I have to give this place a solid 4 stars for their breakfast. I knocked off a star because when I took a glance at the kitchen while paying I noticed they had 3 - 4 big plastic freezer bags full of pre-cooked potatoes and other different foods. Initially I was a little discouraged to eat there due to this, and just generally my not so good first impression of the overall cleanliness of the restaurant. But I was like really hungry so I thought to myself what the fudge. I liked their tortillas, my husband enjoyed their chorizo burrito, I really enjoyed my burrito as well, and it still tasted freshly made, their salsa is very good, and the service was good too. 
I would go back....someday. There are a lot of other places to try first but I don't hesitate to recommend it."}
{"text":"I've now been here at least four times and can say say that each time was great. They make simple Mexican dishes but each item they make is great. They're breakfast burritos are the best and the beans they put in are just awesome. I would recommend this to anyone that is interested in real Mexican food, jus beware parking can get rough sometimes"}
{"text":"All I can say is that this little hole in the wall is the BOMB!! IT'S HARD TO FIND GOOD MEXICAN FOOD!! 

IT is tiny get a menu and pre-order
Enjoy"}
{"text":"They have the best breakfast tacos and the tortillas are home-made. The potato, bacon and egg burritos are amazing! The area is a little sketchy looking but it's worth going for their food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Found it in a serendipitous accident (because taco bell closed down) 

Been a loyal customer for almost a year now. You can come in, spend any amount of money and enjoy something amazing. Owner Fernando is very friendly. Try their green chili and goat birria!

Support true small businesses!"}
{"text":"So I went based on the reviews. Got a pick up order of a carne asada burrito, Arizona burrito and an order of chicken flautas. The burritos were good, but not like \"holy crap I need this inside me\" good. The flautas were actually really good though! I dipped them sh*ts in the guacamole and they went down my throat like it was prom night! If you go here and want it to go, call ahead or you'll be waiting awhile."}
{"text":"This place has the best breakfast burrito, the Special Burrito!!! The chips and salsa are made in hosue and always good. Not the best looking but has the best home cooked food!!! Owners are always the ones cooking and customer
Service is excellent!!"}
{"text":"When we arrived we we're a little bit hesitant because the place looked really small and old. We stayed because of all the great reviews and I am happy we did. Food was good. We had the chilaquiles and chorizo eggs and they we're very tasty. Liked their home made salsa and flour tortillas. I was excited to see menudo, barbacoa and machaca. I will definitely be back to keep exploring their menu."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Adrian's for the past year and every time I eat here it reminds me of my grandmothers cooking. It's a little hole in the wall restaurant with only 5 tables but the wait is worth it. I usually call ahead for pick up since they are super busy and you'll see why. Their food is made fresh to order and the homemade tortillas are bought locally. Try their breakfast chorizo burrito or chorizo  and egg plate with beans and potato. Also the Arizona burrito is crazy good!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant ever.  We live in Tucson and whenever we are on that side of Phoenix we go.  The restaurant is very small with only 5 tables. It can be a little loud but totally worth it.  The food is made fresh when ordered. The folks that work there are hopping busy but very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"This place is such a little hole in the wall dive but the people there are very nice and the food is authentic and amazing. Might I add this is 100 times better than Filibertos and should be given a chance!"}
{"text":"I just love this place.  The owners are friendly and welcoming Mexicans and virtually all the patrons are Mexican.  It's small, not all that clean but it's cute as a bug's ear and the food is so good and genuine.  I have had the huevos rancheros and the cheese enchiladas.  Both were superb with a capital S.  It's fun, cheap and delicious.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"After reading the great Yelp reviews of Adrian's Mexican Food, I was convinced to give them a try.  The shabby, run down building inside and out, along with the adjoining sketchy neighborhood didn't deter me one bit.  We all know of a shabby place or two that has the most delicious food imaginable.  
I was expecting Adrian's to serve me some awesome food, but was very disappointed.  The food was just barely average.  I ordered the carne asada burrito, light on the beans.  It came out with at least 2/3 beans and 1/3 carne asada.  The tortilla and beans were fine.  The carne asada was the true test, and it was bland without any discernible spice or flavor.  I had to pick through the burrito to find the meat because I wasn't able to taste it.  The whole deal tasted like a frozen burrito from the grocery store. 
Adrian's served the burrito on a plate with a small side of plain green lettuce and chopped tomatoes.  I was told the green and red salsa that came with the chips was intended to compliment my burrito.  Both salsas were watery; the green was bland; the red was super hot.  I love pico de gallo, but that was an extra $2.25.  I didn't think it was worth the money when I saw the rather small portion size at another table.  
Living in the Phoenix area, top notch Mexican food is readily available.  I won't be going back to Adrian's and certainly can't give them my recommendation."}
{"text":"You always get the best food from a tiny little place that doesn't look like much. We came to Adrian's today after reading the Yelp reviews and the food was truly incredible! I have a really hard time finding truly authentic Mexican food in Mesa, mostly because the food caters to the tender palettes of the snow birds. 
This place packs a powerful punch of flavour into everything they make. 
It's a tiny little place with only 4 tables in it, and a constant flow of patrons. Be prepared to take it to go if you can't get a table, but don't leave without ordering food if you're disappointed about not getting a seat. 
My husband had the carne asada burrito, and for the first time, I tasted what a carne asada SHOULD taste like. Man was it good! Excellent grilled flavour with amazing herbs and spices built in for layers of flavour. 
I had the green chile burrito, enchilada style. Full of meat, and the sauce was worthy of plate-licking. I added jalapeño to mine, as I love the heat. It was the first time I felt I had satisfied my inner craving for truly authentic Mexican food. We had it for lunch and I am still wonderfully full and it's almost dinner time. 
We will absolutely be back. Probably sooner than my husband knows! I can't wait to try the other dishes. 
They also make killers breakfasts. Large portions and low prices. 
These are the little shops we need to keep supporting! You won't regret coming here."}
{"text":"Had the chilaquiles today and the boyfriend had a bacon egg and cheese burrito. The food is so delicious!! I talked to the lady when i picked up our food and she said they've been there 21 years and it looks like they get rave reviews for their delicious grub over the years. I feel like everything tasted authentic and my idea of Mexican \"soul food\". Definitely cured a bit of a hangover! The inside is small and quaint but i feel like they could take a day and clean it up real good. Still five stars because it was just that good."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite type of restaurant! Excellent food, friendly service, cheap, and NOT a chain! This little hole in the wall is just wonderful. The owner is very personable and makes his own mole. Everything we had was great.  This is a must when we are in Phx."}
{"text":"I have been in search for a perfect breakfast burrito. I have tried several places. I finally stopped when I found Adrians. Most places the egg to potato ratio is too high to the bacon but this place has the perfect mix. If you want a good spice, the red salsa is to die for. The only downside is that they are closed after 4 but this place is the perfect stop for a heavy lunch so you can eat a lighter dinner. The workers are there are very very reasonable. I can't wait to go in and eat there. Keep in mind there are only a couple of small tables but the food there is totally worth it. I can't even try to like anywhere else anymore. Best mexican in the Valley Yet!"}
{"text":"The green chili burrito was sooo good.  This is real mexican food!"}
{"text":"I have ventured here twice with two different groups of people and each time everyone raved and left me coming back. Its old school and of you are pretentious in any way you will complain but its a dive Mexican Restaurant where the food is made the right way with care. This is the kind of small town place you would find in Texas and the Horchata was to die for. I left off one star only because free chips and salsa is a Mexican staple and they lake that and sodas are in a can other wise I find it perfect."}
{"text":"Almost didn't. Wanted authentic Mexican for lunch, and this place popped up as the highest rated. Almost didn't stop because the place looked schetchy as heck. So glad we did. The sever was great, smile on his face the whole time. Food was the best mexican I've ever tried. def coming back."}
{"text":"I stopped here because the local ethnic crowd had a line around the building.  It was a good move!  My father said they served him the best liver and onions he had ever had...I was insulted then realized I'd never made him that dish...So I'm better now!  I had Mole Chicken.  Excellent, juicy chicken and great sauce.  I will be back.  Please comment and follow me for more reviews!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited this place based on the reviews. I was hesitant at first because of the lack of parking and the trailer park in the back but that should not deter you. We walked in and immediately were welcomed by the man at the cashier and the service was nothing but friendly. My boyfriend got the lengua burrito and said it was the best lengua he has ever had. However the show stopper was the chili rellenos burrito (vegetarian). It was absolutely to die for and was not too spicy but wasn't exactly tame either. We will be back over and over again. One of the best Mexican joints I have ever been to! (Even if it looks like a hole in the wall joint)"}
{"text":"Do not want to judge this book by its cover.  Had I not read the other Yelp reviews I would have passed on his place.  Small unique place. Quick service and friendly. Good eats too for a nice Mexican breakfast."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food...ever. And I come from a border town. Don't be scared by the surroundings try this place and you won't be disappointed! I had the chorizo plate and my husband had the huevos rancheros both were so good and big portions. The hot sauce they give is pretty spicy but addicting! Will definitely come back! Prices are low!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good breakfast burrito in the area. After the reviews I read on this place, I still hesitantly decided to check it out (hey - I'm white, I am weird when it comes to Mexican breakfast and there aren't many reviews on breakfast.) I called this morning and placed an order for myself and my coworker. The guy who answered the phone was very friendly and then professional. 

Got there and I was less than impressed with the parking area. Trailer park behind doesn't help. I walk in and not sure what to think. Tiny dining area but fairly busy. Place is run down, your less than average hole in the wall. I get my food, noticing the size of my order, and leave. $11 for 2 burritos. (Again, the guy at the front was very nice. Asked if I had an order to pick up - probably because I was the only girl in there.)

I get to work and bite into my burrito. It was a food explosion in my mouth. The potatoes were perfectly cooked, the eggs were fluffy, the bacon was delicious, the cheese was tasty and didn't overpower the burrito, and the tortilla was flavorful. My coworker said it was the best burrito ever (except that it had a bit too many onions). The portions were huge. I ate 1/2 for breakfast and the other 1/2 for dinner. 

Biggest complaint? Parking and ambiance. Also, the red sauce is good but will burn your tongue. The green sauce is phenomenal. I like my sauce more chunky but since this is a Mexican joint I get it. 

Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"YUM! Adrian's exceeded our expectations! The food was delicious and the service was outstanding! This is a family owned restaurant with a very small but cozy atmosphere! Would recommend to anyone looking for true authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food has always lived up to my expectations for good wholesome Mexican food. The breakfast is awesome and they have menudo everyday there. I will continue coming here."}
{"text":"What a find!  Amazing food.  Family owned, service oriented small restaurant.  Been here twice.  Loved it twice.  Best chilaquiles I've ever had."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Great service. Nice hole in the wall Mexican Food place, easy to pass by but hard to leave. The special breakfast burrito is delicious. The chilequiles are amazing. Best horchata I have had. I would come back every day, if I could. Will be recommending to all my friends and family!"}
{"text":"Such a nice guy who owns the place. Delicious breakfast burrito. I plan on making this my new go-to spot for Mexican food cravings."}
{"text":"NO WAY this place should get high rating on Yelp!
Nothing special or extra ordinary.  I commend them for a good service but as far as the food quality goes, 3 stars is fair in my opinion.  I ordered Carnitas plate and my wife ordered pork tamale and chicken tostadas.  None of them were above average.  I admit that we who live in metro Phoenix area are spoiled with great Mexican restaurants but for the same reason, it must have extra ordinary food quality to claim high rating and this place was not one of them.  I will NOT come back here."}
{"text":"You HAVE to give this place a try. I went for breakfast, had the breakfast burrito with egg, chorizo and potato. Amazing! It's not a fancy place to be sure, but it's clean and quite reminiscent of my grandmas' homes."}
{"text":"Don't usually leave reviews, but this place is amazing, I had a couple of street tacos, wonderful flavor! Thinking of moving into the trailer park just to be close to this place! :-)"}
{"text":"My absolute, definitive #1 spot for grabbing a breakfast burrito. These guys are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Ever since we found we were moving to this area I've been craving some really *good* mexican food.   I found this place on my trusty Yelp app and figured we'd give it a try.  

Its a tiny little shack of a place, with 6 tables.   I liked it immediately.   It has a little charm and style that fits the faire.   Its small, but clean.   I wasn't in the mood for Mexican food out of a strip mall..

The management is very friendly and personable.    So far, so good.   My wife ordered the chimichanga and I'm always a sucker for carne asada platters.    They were excellent!   Everything tasted home made and built for flavor, including the beans and rice.   My wife, who is usually pretty picky loved her meal as well.  

They did a steady stream of lunch take out orders while we sat and ate, and I can see why.   This place is doing EVERYTHING right, and we will definitely be back.  

I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"It's my first time and thank God the experience was really great. Tiny place but BIG food. Right along the light rail. Their breakfast burrito are phenomenal for the price. Adrian's is a true gem, may look like a hole in the wall but the service and food are top notch. Be back for another delightful experience."}
{"text":"This place is small but yummy. Order to go is recommended it gets hot fast. But the food is yummy and staff is nice and attentive. If you want good mexican, Go here! Not too pricey for the quality of food. Located near light rail."}
{"text":"By far the best and most authentic Mexican food in the valley. Amazing and friendly service too, every time! I'll never eat breakfast burritos anywhere else again. Oh! And their carnitas... are on point. I highly recommend stopping in!"}
{"text":"Oh my god, best breakfast burrito ever. I was so happy we decided to go try this place this weekend. its very tiny inside, but we managed to get a table. the tortillas were SO fresh & the salsas were delicious. also only $3.50!! cant wait to come back."}
{"text":"Yes!! Yes! And yes... BEST chorizo, egg & potato burrito I have ever had. I will most definitely be back for another breakfast burrito. The employees made me feel so welcome, it was the best. OH and their red salsa is amazing and had the perfect spice! New favorite :)"}
{"text":"This food is just like going to my Mexican grandmother's house. If my grandmother was still alive and if she was Mexican! So good and authentic. Definitely a place to keep in mind."}
{"text":"Small, unassuming restaurant. Best chorizo and eggs in the valley. The beans are tasty, flour tortillas are fresh and the potatoes are seasoned perfectly. The owners and their family members are the only workers. Don't expect anything fancy. Parking is a pain because of light rail construction but well worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Had the special breakfast burrito, sadly it was not that great. They are super crowded in the weekends I think I will try them again for a real breakfast but not breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem! Stopped in for a quick snack before church and it was sooo delicious!! The outside looks like it's actually closed... But don't let that stop you. When my husband walked in, he said \"Now this is an authentic Mexican restaurant.\" He felt like he was in Ensenada! We bought about three burritos and it came $12. You can't get that price anywhere! We got the bacon-potato and the Green Burrito! That Green Chole Burrito is awesome! My favorite!!! Sooo tasty!! And the tortillas are so light and buttery. We ate it all!!!"}
{"text":"I think I just had the best breakfast burrito I have ever ate.  Hands down.  Seriously go check this place out.  Tasted fresh, not greasy, even though had bacon.  Coworkers that also ordered from there (we picked it up to go) loved it.  Tortilla was awesome.  Staff at the restaurant was very friendly and you get a whole lot of food for your money."}
{"text":"Despite the reviews, I was skeptical when I walked in, but service was friendly and fast, and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Just wow. This place is authentic to the fullest, love the atmosphere here. Just a hole in the wall gem. I will be back.  wish there was more sitting but who cares when the food is that good. I had a carne asada burrito, tongue tacos and homemade flan. off the charts. See you soon"}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews, it rarely happens. I know how hard it is to run a business and how much sacrifice it takes to make customers happy. With that said, I gave this place two stars because the staff is friendly and attentive otherwise it would be a one star review. The food is some of the worst I've had. It was our first time visiting and upon first impression we were excited to try it because everything added up: hole in the wall - check! Owners and staff including cooks are Mexican - check! Customers at every table, all Mexican - check! Must be authentic! So we tried a variety of items on the menu and split it: carne asada burrito, cow tongue burrito, barbacoa taco and carnitas taco. The meat tastes like it isn't marinated so there is no flavor, it was dry and the ingredients didn't come together. It wasn't inexpensive either. I'm leaving this here as honest feedback for the owners so they can make adjustments. I really hope they do."}
{"text":"Perhaps one of the best Mexican restaurants in the valley.  Not a lot on ambiance, but makes up for it with the food.  Enchiladas are great and the tacos are really good.  I've also heard breakfast is really good there.  I believe they close at 4, so breakfast and lunch only."}
{"text":"This is our once a week treat. Going to Adrians is my way of having a happy indulgence. My favorite potato bean egg and green sauce burrito is so filling and satisfying. The tortilla is perfect, the filling is cooked just right & I get my Mexican food fix without having something smothered in cheese & sauce to the point that you can't taste the core ingredients. I really love this place.
We always just call in our order to go because the space & seating is so limited. It is in a sketchy side of town, but it's still safe. Also the owner (that is who I think it is on the Mondays that we are there) is so super kind! Which is the extra bonus of going there each week."}
{"text":"So I have know about this place for a few years now but have never tried until today. Little to no parking and 5 tables to sit at. I ordered the carne asada burrito enchilada style with beans. My wife ordered the arizona burrito with beans as well. For drinks we ordered one water with lemon and one large horchata. Ford came out hot and fast which was great. The water tasted great not like some places where you get sink water. The horchata was ok but it had a taste like some other places I have had which is of soap. The good tasted good only complaints I have is I did happen to get two pieces of fat in mine and when I tasted my wife's I got a piece of fat as well. Other then that my burrito came only with carne asada and beans nothing else. No Pico or anything. Will I go back yes to try other stuff."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall restaurant with cheap prices and great food! I'm not a fan of the Mexican options I've tried here in Phoenix. Having lived in Mexico and being from San Diego (taco shop capital of the world) I have high standards when it comes to Mexican food, this is a place I can easily recommend. 
The one downside is a lot of people already know how good it is, so expect to wait for a table. I noticed a lot of people calling in their orders might be a good idea if you want to take avoid the wait and enjoy on the go.
P.S. I never say Mexican food is authentic because it varies so widely from region to region within Mexico, but if you want \"real\" Mexican food you'll find it here!"}
{"text":"Adrian!! (In your best Rocky Balboa voice). The food here probably won't improve your boxing physique but it's comforting and filling. The restaurant itself is in a more run down part of Mesa right next to a small mobile home park. The restaurant is pretty small too, I saw maybe 5 tables for dine-in guests. 

I had been craving chilaquiles all weekend. Since I was in the area after an appointment, I figured I'd try them out from Adrian's since it had been on my bookmarks list for a while. The chilaquiles is probably one of the most expensive things on their menu at a little over $10 after tax, but they pack a lot of food in your order. I got 2 eggs, refried beans, a generous serving of tortilla chips with red sauce, some pieces of thin steak, tortillas, and salsa. It didn't take too long for them to make it and I was ready to go back home and enjoy my breakfast feast!

When I opened up my to go box it looked like a hot mess but it was a delicious hot mess. The eggs were perfectly cooked, with a lovely runny yolk. The tortilla chips were lightly crisp, and while the steak was fairly tender and I saw seasoning on it, it wasn't as flavor-packed as the rest of the meal. 

Service was cheerful and friendly."}
{"text":"I was in Arizona with my son a few weeks ago for spring training, and I wanted a chance to try something that was a little away from the standard places near Sloan Park, and through the magic of Yelp, I found Adrian's, and we loved it.

My son is just 5, so he's not exactly an adventurous eater, but he's at least willing to try new places, even when he's not going to venture far from the kids items on the menu. He got the pancakes and was very pleased, and I got a breakfast burrito, and was more than pleased.

Great, great place, and I'll find an excuse to get back to spring training in the coming years and come back here for sure."}
{"text":"What everybody else said!  Great food in a little hole in the wall cooked and served by really nice people. An interesting cast of characters (in a good way) to interact with as well. The egg, chorizo and potato burrito was tasty, filling and a major bargain. Heartily recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing service and breakfast burritos. The owner was very sweet and personable. He came over to greet us and offer us some samples of different food options. They also allowed us to eat with our dog! Love love love this place."}
{"text":"Oh holy cow! Their horchata and piña are delicious! We had a couple of really good burritos too - carnitas and barbacoa. The red and green chile sauce are super flavorful. The best part? Their service! The lady there is so sweet - she kept offering us samples of different foods they'd made, all of which was fantastic."}
{"text":"I LOVE this authentic mexican food!! My family has been coming here for over 20yrs! The staff are like family now and are always so friendly. The food is AMAZING and very resonably priced. You are really missing out if you don't add this to your list restaurant rotations."}
{"text":"I live about 3 minutes from Adrian's, and finally gave it a try today! I got a Machaca Burrito, and it was super great!  The place looks like a total dumpster fire from the outside, but inside, while super aged, and worn out, is clean, and cute.  I did try the Horchata, which was nothing special, but the burrito was incredible, and I can't wait to head back, and try other stuff :)"}
{"text":"Green chile burrito. Comes with chips and salsa for under $5. Still eating it now. Pretty hot temperature-wise, so slow going right now (but nothing wrong with that). What I've been able to eat so far is amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing. Truly. Don't let the location fool you, this place has unbelievably delicious mexican food. Super authentic, affordable, and the staff was super friendly. Definitely gonna be my mexican spot to go to."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall!!! The place is small, like tiny, no AC and sometimes no lights. But the food, THE FOOD, so good! I got a breakfast burrito with egg, cheese, potato & beans. Omg the beans are to die for. I got pico on the side so it didn't make the burrito soggy. The freaking tortillas are made from scratch and are to die for. I was full the entire day. Yes I'll be back."}
{"text":"Very very tasty.  Wanted to try something new and we were happily surprised.  We are both Arizona natives and this place is truly authentic. Quaint would be an understatement, only 5 tables.  Keep in mind before you head that way, they close at 4 everyday."}
{"text":"Walked in here for breakfast and it is this tiny place sitting on the lot of trailer park. The building is small and seating is very limited. Don't let the looks fool you. The food was amazing and it was pretty close to what I would find in Mexico. The Chileques came with a slab of steak and the scrambled eggs. The meat was very well cooked and the even though I drove home with it, the tortillas didn't get soggy from the beans and these cheese. Definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Mexican food. The staff is very personable and strive to make your visit enjoyable. I had enchilada, taco, tamale, and a tostada! So good, will definitely be back if I come back to Phoenix Metro area."}
{"text":"The reviews brought me in. The two burritos we got bean and cheese and carne asada will bring me back. Some things are very subjective to ones own tastes and preferences. 
The tortillas while quite good and complimentary to the food are missing the tenderness and melt in your mouth texture i was hoping for. 
The meat of the carne asada was like home made tender perfectly seasoned and tasty. It didnt have the guacamole or pico de gallo most add but stood strong on its own
The beans.... these are home made beans refried. Slightly mashed with some whole beans left in. Sorry ma... these guys somehow magically copied your beans. Perfect.. and with apologies to ma.. i will return for the beans alone. 
Tiny is an exaggeration... so plan on togo... but try the place"}
{"text":"I was looking forward eating here and when I saw the place needs to be condemned, my mouth started to salivate. However, the girl behind the counter seemed unhappy serving a gringo and I'm not even sure my carne asada burrito was cow meat and possibly not even meat at all. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Try the Arizona Burrito and make it enchilada style with green sauce! You won't regret it! It had carne asada, potato, beans, rice and some veggies. Omg so good. My husband just got the normal carne asada burrito enchilada style with red sauce and he likes it because some the carne had burnt tips and he likes the crunchy ends. I'm guessing it's family ran which I love they were all super nice. And I almost forgot try the Piña water it's soooo good. It's not so heavy like other piña waters I have tried and  it actually had chunks of piña in it!"}
{"text":"Even the pancakes are especially good but I come for the chorizo and eggs with Papas and beans. Just like my mom used to make."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast burritos! This is a huge step above Filiberto's type places. It was a total dive nestled right in by a trailer park. My burrito was delicious with eggs, bacon, and potatoes. My wife ordered one with machaca that she loved as well. You can not beat the price for how amazing these burritos are. A must try if you love breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"I have been looking for somewhere that has great tortillas and horchata. I finally found it and will be going here as often as my wallet can handle! The prices are great and the service is also very good. I recommend the carne asada because it was marinated well."}
{"text":"Great food all around, but not necessarily good for you.  If you eat here enough, you will surely pack on some extra pounds.  Yes, it's located next to some dingy trailer park ghetto. No, I haven't been mugged...yet."}
{"text":"Tried this after reading the reviews here on Yelp. I wish we had tried it sooner-it was one of the best places we've eaten at in a long time! Service was awesome and we were even offered samples to help us narrow down our choices (we couldn't decide between the green or red chile). Both were amazing. We also had the carnitas, carne asada & Barbacoa tacos as well as the bean and cheese burrito. It doesn't look like the most appealing place from the outside but I wouldn't let that deter you. It's clean and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Really good hole in the wall spot..the burritos are huge for the price..Chorizo not too greasy. Fresh tasting flour tortillas..wow! I will be back to try more food here! The chorizo, beans, potato and chorizo was the bomb!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in the whole state of Arizona thus far. Fernando (the owner), knows exactly what I want when I come in and wastes no time in preparing my meal. I recommend the fried steak, or the pork ribs in tomatillo sauce. This place has THE BEST hortchata I have ever tried in my life (they also sell it to you by the gallon to take home). DOO ITT!"}
{"text":"Fresh food, good coffee. The breakfast plates are delicious. They have a shake that's really good too (add banana). Great service and prices can't be beat! Solid."}
{"text":"I had the Chorizo and Egg Burrito. It was dry and tasted bad. Hardly any egg in it. The pork was real dry and seemed spoiled. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food.  We had a barbacoa burrito & a carnitas quesadilla.  Yum!  Only 5 tables, but friendly, attentive, speedy service.  Named one of 100 best restaurants in the U.S. by USA Today.   We stop here every time we're in town."}
{"text":"Don't let the fact it's in front of a trailer park fool you, this place has some delicious Mexican food."}
{"text":"This space is so cute and feels like eating at grandmas old house. Awesome, attentive service, and you can really tell that the owner cares about his customer. Food surpassed my expectations and portions were larger than I expected. Coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the exterior.   Fresh corn tortillas filled with carne asada, barbacoa and carnitas topped with cilantro and onions.  Well worth the stop."}
{"text":"This was probably the best Mexican food I have ever had in Arizona.  I visit Mexico often, so I do have some standards when it comes to Mexican food. I tried a variety of their dishes today from the 7 mares soup to cheese enchiladas, and they were all phenomenal.  If you are a down to earth person who feels comfortable going to the dive bar, you will love this place! Everyone who worked there were super nice as well. I will definitely be back here again!"}
{"text":"Yummy food and good service. Super yummy breakfast burritos!!
Typical hole in the wall Mexican place. The food is so yummy; don't judge a book by its cover!"}
{"text":"Very nice little breakfast and dinner place. We ordered carne asada dinner plate. There's a lot of meat, mild spicy and very different. Would definitely go back again. The owners were very welcoming and nice."}
{"text":"FIRST!  Hot damn this place is GREAT!!  This place defines the term \"hole in the wall Mexican\".  It's across the street from a thrift store, and literally sits on the street in front of a trailer park.  Their breakfast is amazing and out of this world!  For $4-$6 you can get a DELICIOUS Mexican breakfast.  The service is friendly, food is the bomb, and price is cheap.  You will not be disappointed with this place, unless yore a total retard douche."}
{"text":"Hands down best Mexican food in Phoenix. Their beans, corn tortillas and horchata are magical. Oh and so is their green sauce. I can't say enough good things about this place. Their wait staff are very friendly as well. My only negative comment is the place is the size of a postage stamp and can be quite a wait if you get there later. But that still hasn't deterred myself or my husband!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem. The service was great. Little mom and pop shop with amazing food. The tortilla was to die for. I have had a lot of breakfast burritos it this was by far the BEST!!"}
{"text":"Just went to Adrian's for the second time. I was happier the first time. I ordered a carne asada tostada and literally could taste the meat 6 hours later - and not in a good way. Son had the Milanese (steak breaded and fried) and it was pretty greasy. Only giving 3 stars because the food was better the first time."}
{"text":"Definitely the BEST authentic Mexican I've had at a restaurant! Delicious spicy hot salsa!!! I could eat here everyday! The cheese enchiladas are AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food!  We are from Tucson, and found this place on Yelp.  It's a hole in the wall joint, that serves really yummy food.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good place to eat. Everything was fresh and the service was great. The piña water was perfect!  I order the special burrito and it was worth the 5$ price 2x. I definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Nothing really to add - just piling on. Fresh off airplane from MW and had this great find. Thanks Yelp community!  As noted, don't be bothered by the trailer park. And don't be intimidated trying to order. We weren't the only ones here that didn't know what to order. Awesome green chili beef. Funny how authentic Mexican food is flavorful without being ridiculously hot."}
{"text":"That was soooo... good. Just a few tables in a small space but, wow, great variety on the menu and super friendly people. We had the Barbacoa triumvirate of tacos, burrito and tostada. My burrito may have included the best flour tortilla I've ever eaten. Amazing meal!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. The guy at the counter gave me a sample of the green Chile which was fantastic. The chips took a minute to come out because they were literally frying fresh tortilla chips. Fantastic food and really good personable service. Authentic dishes like birria and lengua and food to satisfy the gringo like carne asada. Go there!"}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior stop you from trying this place.  As other reviewers have said,  the place is clean inside,  the food is delicious and the folks running it are very welcoming and friendly. We had a group of five people. The interior is pretty small but they immediately moved a couple of tables together to accommodate us. We also saw several people come in for take out which might not be a bad idea in the summer months since there is little to no air conditioning. The service was quick and we were asked several times if we needed anything and if the food was ok. Oh it was. Nearly everything we tried was incredibly good. The highlight for me was the tacos (especially the carnitas), but I really want to try the carne asada burrito next time. A friend had the lengua burrito and said it was really tender and flavorful."}
{"text":"What a delicious little secret... We stopped in for a late breakfast, but you can order from breakfast and lunch/dinner at any time. The green chile beef burrito was very good, although I felt like it needed bit more spice. I added pico de gallo and it was delightful.   Their chorizo is homemade and so flavorful. No weird red grease like regular chorizo. It was exceptional! We ordered the chorizo, egg, bean burrito because we don't care for potato in burritos. It was really good. They are healthy sized burritos. They will fill you up!  We also had a pancake, which was SO tender. I rarely eat pancakes, but I am still thinking fondly of that one. Prices are crazy cheap too. I almost felt guilty, because I have sure paid a heck of a lot more for a heck of a lot less. We are excited to go back for dinner and try some tamales, rellanos, carnitas, etc."}
{"text":"The location and look of the place may seem a little shady to some but don't let that fool you. The food is delicious, fresh, and the portions are generous. I had a chorizo burrito and it was a good size and had plenty of meat, not full of potatoes and eggs like some places. I will def be back!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location or appareance inside/outside fool you. The food is authentic and service is superb. The coffee is good and fresh. The coke is served in a glass bottle (so delicious) and the food delivery is fast. Its very small but very efficient. First comes drinks then a basket of chips with two different salsas. Next is the main meal you ordered. The tacos are so damn good, as well as the fajitas. Free refills on coffee and attentive service with great prices! We will eat here again."}
{"text":"Wow I love this place! The people are always so sweet that work there! The food is fresh and always so good! Brought some friends with me and they loved it as well! If you love Mexican food, come here"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem !!! Most people will just drive by it by based on looks of building. Everybody is missing out. Great Mexican food!! My son and I pickup to go orders. We have gone 3x in last 2 weeks. Food is amazing everytime. Homemade and family run. Items we have indulged in

Bean and cheese burro --10 stars
Chorizo and egg burro--10 stars
Bean and potato burro--10 stars

{"text":"Amazing breakfast burritos, great vegetarian burrito! Authentic atmosphere, felt like I was in Mexico! I would definitely go back every time I am at work looking for breakfast which is often."}
{"text":"Authentic, just like having breakfast at my Nana's house growing up. Had chorizo plate with beans and potatoes. The tortilla alone was something I don't get back on the east coast. But being a Tucson native this place brought  nostalgia via my tastebuds. Glad j read these reviews, from the exterior I would have driven right past. Truly a hidden gem."}
