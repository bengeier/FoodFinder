{"text":"The service was excellent but the food left a lot to be desired. 

I had the linguine carbonara and it was more like scrambled eggs and noodles. Bland noodles. I really wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"All right, people.  Can we all please finally shake off the illusion that Bloomfield has amazing Italian restaurants?  Granted, I haven't been to *all* of them, but I've been to most of them and for the mediocre Pleasure Bar to be the best of them is just sad.  

The real problem here:  This is food for fat people.  Lots of fried stuff.  Lots of oil.  Yeah, those potato balls were delicious, but dear god were they heavy.  I guess I should have expected fried balls of mashed potatoes to be heavy, but of course there wasn't just potato in there.  There was cheese and I think I even detected some mayonnaise.  This is definitely a \"sometimes food.\"  A delicious, heavy sometimes food.

Now, full disclosure:  I'm a vegetarian and restaurants are always a completely different experience for vegetarians.  So if you're not veg, you may want to take all of this with a grain of salt.  They may do meat dishes spectacularly.  But vegetarians, take note.

Italian restaurants aren't really known for making decent veg food and this place is no different.  I had the portabello mushroom sandwich.  First off, the sandwich would have been better had the bread been toasted.  However, it was very soft and airy - not something I'd expect from ciabatta.  The mushrooms tasted like they had been marinated in Kraft Zesty Italian, cooked in more Kraft Zesty Italian and then topped with Kraft Zesty Italian.  This was by far the oiliest sandwich I've ever had.  To make it worse, there was too much cheese - two thick slices of provolone.  Am I the only who has noticed that too much cheese on things is a real problem in Pittsburgh?  

On the positive side, the bartender was very attentive and very polite.  Also, the beer selection was good.  I'd definitely drink here, but eating here, eh, not so much for me."}
{"text":"ROACH PROBLEM 

3/12/2013 
I walked in sat down, greeted by friendly staff and great decor. I ordered a tortellini dish with a type of meat sauce. Everything was going great, the food was delicious, when I and 4 other patrons noticed what seemed to be THE LARGEST ROACH in existence climbing up the wall. I alerted the staff and management and at which time sick to my stomach I left.......... Never to return.. I cannot think of eating there again. That experience was my first and last at the pleasure bar... not a great first impression."}
{"text":"The food is awesome, but is definitely \"Pittsburgh Italian\" - large portions and everything is thick and covered in cheese.  The wedding soup and bread are phenomenal! 

The place has a large, older TV in the side dining room (which sort of smells like cat pee) - but is pretty good for watching any sporting event.

Service here is always iffy.  Do not request Molly as your server.  While she is quick to get your order, she is otherwise completely inattentive and unfriendly to the point of borderline rudeness.  I have had much better service here from other servers.

I give the food 4 stars, but the service and decor brings it way down to a two.  The place is worth the price for a lunch portions (to-go, of course), but probably not worth a sit down dinner."}
{"text":"Eggplant Parmesan was delicious.  Portions are huge.  Great place for a family to go to get some Italian food."}
{"text":"Its ok. Ive had wrose.......ive had better. I had their baked ziti. Kind of expected more food. My daughters plate looked full mine really looked half full.

Not sure i would go back. Id probably try another italian spot."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now.  I think it ranks better than Dell's if you enjoy their food.  I ordered the eggplant parm and loved it.  My group of four all enjoyed their dishes and one of them is straight up italian (shocking to us she said it sufficed-in my book win for pleasure bar).  I have sat at the bar both times so I cannot speak to actually service otherwise but the bartender was attentive and our food came out quick."}
{"text":"Solid Italian food time and time again.  Great Romano.  We had a great waitress as she was attentive but not annoying.  Will return."}
{"text":"We were here to celebrate my son's graduation on a Sunday afternoon. Our large group was easily accommodated on a quiet day. The service was excellent as the waitress was personal and very attentive. The bread is very fresh. the Italian rolls,ordered as an appetizer, were very delicious. The pasta pomodoro and chicken Marsala were excellent. The kid's pizza a large potion and quite delicious.The chicken madiera was very disappointing, as it contained minimal spinach and was lathered in a tasteless brown sauce."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in the door we were greeted with kindness and enthusiasm. The staff here is incredible, they have a wide variety of brews, and I got tortellini with shrimp and it was absolutely dynamite. One side of the restaurant has a big square sports bar , and the other has a very classy and traditional Italian feel to it, almost like you're at your aunt's house for Sunday dinner. The best of both worlds! I just moved to Bloomfield 2 months ago and would highly recommend Pleasure Bar to anyone who wants a safe option when it comes to good service, food, and beer."}
{"text":"The appetizers were great. Stuffed mushrooms, but my seafood pasta just came up bland and too oily. The broccoli in it was overcooked and the shrimp were undercooked. Italian wedding soup was okay--tasted like it came from a can. For the price though, it was pretty worth it. 

Would only go back for the stuffed muchrooms"}
{"text":"Ive been a fan of the Pleasure Bar from it the 60's ...it's current owners have kept some of the classic PB dishes,  along with their outstanding new menu.  
My only complaint is that service is sketchy at best.  Having to ask for set ups, for water, for bread, for menus.....just turns me off.  Our party of 4 had a variety of entrees, all were good, but were missing 'something'.  Salad dressing was incorrect, soup was given to wrong person, cheese for pasta came after the dish was almost finished.  We were told that the larger beer glasses were dirty and we had to take a smaller glass!  The servers were frazzled, and surly....not a great combo.   So if you want a great meal in Bloomfield, and don't mind service that is sub par, try the PB."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. We were told it had the best food. Ha! The only good thing was the potato balls. 
Our waitress was rude and slow. She never brought our soup or salad. She got our order  wrong and blamed it in \" being alone\". We could not get a drink refill. When I asked to return my dish she said everyone likes their food and taste is subjective and nothing they can do. 
The decor is bad , but was willing to over look it if the food was good. Bad experience 
Very disappointed :-("}
{"text":"The dining room is on the small side with tables placed just a little too close together . Conversations at nearby tables could be here heard so clearly that I felt compelled to respond on several occasions. A bit of Italian music in the background would have gone a long way toward setting the mood and preventing some serious mastcation irritation. I ordered manicotti and my wife ordered the eggplant parmesan. Serving size was just about right. The food was good, the sauce was excellent. The service was great. The main point of the irritation for me came when we received the bill. The food prices were fair...$12 for the parm and $14 for the the manicotti, but my wife had also ordered a glass of house Pino without asking the price. $13.75!!  I thought surely that it had to be a mistake. I mean it wasn't even a big pour, not even a decent wine glass. Not sure what kind it was but I'm thinking Woodbridge or the one with the kangaroo on the label, certainly not top shelf. I asked the waitress about the price (appearing quite the cheapass since im sure that the entire dining room could hear me despite my attempts to the contrary given the aforementioned acoustics) and she said \"nope it's not a mistake\". So I guess the moral of the story is to ask the drink prices before ordering ......or maybe just have yourself a nice glass of iced tea"}
{"text":"Well to be honest this was one of the worst dinning experiences of my eating career. We sat outside and the service was VERY SLOW. Then my purse gets stolen right from my hand by what I can only describe as a gang of thugs. As if that wasn't bad enough the slow wait staff took about ten minutes to call the police and then proceeded to charge us for our mediocre meals even as they saw me telling the police how my wallet had been stolen under the waitstaffs not so watchful eye. Save your money and your wallet and go to wendy's the quality is far superior to this place."}
{"text":"Very meh, ordered a steak and cheese hoagie and fries and a stuffed mushroom app. Fries were unseasoned and clearly not very fresh, sandwich was unevenly toasted with super thick onion and tomatos piled on. Asked for a side of Italian and a side of mayo didn't get either of those but did get a side of  mustard...very odd choice for a steak hoagie. Mushroom app was ok, drowning in cheese tho. Probably won't order from here again."}
{"text":"Summary: Diner-quality Italian

We attended Little Italy Days a few weeks ago and noticed Pleasure Bar. We were looking to start visiting more restaurants in Bloomfield, and went last night. We always use Yelp reviews when finding a new place to eat, and ordered the potato balls. DELICIOUS! We also ordered the greens (which, in Utica, NY, is a signature dish), which had absolutely no flavor to them. The bread they served us looked unappetizing (stale). The marinara sauce for the app and raviolis tasted like it was from an industrial can. Pesto gnocchi okay, tiramisu okay (except for the canned whipped cream)."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh institution. Solid food, without frills or pretense. It is just what you would expect."}
{"text":"Located in the Bloomfield neighborhood (little Italy) of Pittsburgh, this is an Italian restaurant that stands on it's own.  The atmosphere is not the most ideal, but the food is great.   If you are there for lunch, I would highly recommend getting the Italian sampler to get an idea of their cuisine.

Many of my Italian friends consider this \"The Italian Restaurant\" in Bloomfield."}
{"text":"Some friends and I were here Friday, August 22nd. It was very crowded due to Little Italy Days in Bloomfield. I didn't mind waiting 45 minutes for a table as it was busy, but they seemed really understaffed which was strange since it was Little Italy Days.

Once we were seated, we waited 15 minutes for our waitress Misty to greet us and take our drink orders. She complained about how busy they were and how this was the second double in a row she was working. She told us she was thinking of getting wasted that night and coming in the next day hungover... I can not stand when waitresses/waiters see that we're younger (I'm 25, my friends are in their early 30s) and assume that they can drop all professionalism and talk to us like we're their friends. I sympathize with you being slammed but I don't want to hear you complaining nor do I want to hear about you getting wasted. We should have requested another waitress at that moment.

Two other tables who were seated 10-15 minutes after us got their food about 20 minutes before us. Two other waitresses were working the room and seemed fast and competent. We were the only table with Misty, who was working both the bar area and us. She never checked on us, took forever to get our food to us (which I'm assuming was sitting back in the kitchen for quite some time) and after we finished, we sat there for 20 minutes before we finally flagged down the hostess for our check. From the time we walked in to the time we walked out was a little over 2 hours. Would never consider going back.

The food was good."}
{"text":"Good food. I ordered the seafood alfredo. The sauce could have used more salt but my addition of red pepper flakes was enough. It also came with the choice of french onion soup (can also get italian wedding) or salad. I had the french onion soup; tons of cheese which i love. We also ordered fried zucchini strips as an appetizer. I normally don't like zucchini but they were so thin and the breading was just right"}
{"text":"First off, and I'm sorry, but Pleasure Bar is the most ridiculous and stupid name for a restaurant ever. It sounds like it should be a seedy, crude night club - and it makes it even more absurd when you walk in and find out this is an old school, old man bar with grandma's Italian dining room in the back (ruffles and floral fruit curtains included).

Aside from that (and it's a significant that) - the service was great. The food was warm and filling and homestyle just like we hoped for. A friend and I split the stuffed mushrooms appetizer, so yummy. And our salads (no iceberg - yay!) and dinners were just as good. I'm glad we checked it out. Basic Italian family dinner status, if that's what you're looking for.

But can i mention again how ill-fitting \"Pleasure Bar\" is."}
{"text":"During a recent visit with a friend we stopped here for dinner before a night out. The decor looked a little outdated and in need of an updating but it was cozy none the less.

When it came to their menu I would say that there may be a few too many options. We had trouble choosing. Our waiter was very friendly and gave a few recommendations. He was very attentive when we were ordering, and why wouldn't he be there were a total of 6 other people in the restaurant. 

Starting out with a few apps we went with the crab stuffed mushrooms and the Italian egg rolls. Both were delicious! We both got a side salad, nothing to write home about. and then there was the main Course. We shared a dish of their Malfalda Pasta which is a Mixed Red and white sauce. I couldn't stop eating.

Once it came time to get checks our waiter was no where to be found and it took longer then one would expect again with now only 1 other table present in the dining room.

I left stuffed and happy and so many menu options I would stop in again."}
{"text":"Take a quart of wedding soup home with you.  There has to be a little Italian mama in the back making sauce.

Traditional Italian cooking .... you know what is for lunch tomorrow. ... leftovers from dinner ... huge portions.  I took a 300 lb football player (lean mean fighting machine) there for dinner he couldn't finish the lasagna ... it's that big.

[Parking is an open metered lot behind the restaurant ... people walk their dogs on the sidewalk and through the lot ... watch your step ... there is always a pile.]"}
{"text":"Ugh this place was good years ago ...ate there tonight food was close to horrible...nothing taste fresh or homemade. Bread even tasted old...then to top it off very sick like 4 hours later...our family won't be returning..."}
{"text":"The Pleasure Bar is a great option when visiting Pittsburgh's own Little Italy.  I say they have one of the best meatball sandwiches in town.  The front section of this restaurant is your typical bar with great draft beer options. The back section is home to a fairly large dining room area.  The menu has your pasta and meat entrée options but you can also ask for the bar menu which has many sandwich options.  On our past visit during Little Italy days we were lucky to get a seat in the dining room fairly quickly and had great service. My husband and I started with a Summer Shandy followed shortly by a bread and butter basket.  For my dinner I asked for the sandwich menu and got the meatball sub.  It comes with one side and for a small upcharge I went with the wedding soup. I was a bit disappointed with the wedding soup as it was mostly spinach and not a lot of pasta or meat. My meatball sub was terrific on a fresh roll with 2 huge meatballs topped with marinara and melted provolone cheese.  My husband ordered a pasta entrée with sausage. All of the entrees come with your choice of soup or salad which is a nice bonus.   This is a great family restaurant and good for kids."}
{"text":"Pasta was watery and very limp. The noodles were practically swimming in a pool of warm water.... Presentation was so so and the taste of the food was mediocre. While the food reminded me of home cooked meals, it was pricier than what I would pay for \"homey\" meals. I will not be returning. People seemed to be having fun at the bar area, but I would not return here for Italian food."}
{"text":"Great casual Italian.  The first time I tried (4 years ago), it was very average.  Since then I've tried several times and they have an updated menu and new chef.  My favorites - the meatballs are great! The italian bread pizza appetizer is delicious.  Potato balls and Italian egg rolls are famous.  Wings are average to ok, but that's my fault for ordering wings at an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place in the heart of Bloomfield. I've never eaten at the restaurant, but I've frequented the bar and it's always been serviceable. The bar in the front is very open with four sides and a bunch of TV's for game-watching. There's always some cute girl behind the bar looking to catch tips from young or old single guys from the neighborhood. Had some food at the bar once that was alright. Good for a stop-in at some point."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  This is by far the best Italian food that I have ever had!  So far this was my first time there and I hope to be back again soon. I live a ways away so it's a little difficult to get there often. I had the lunch lasagna. The best most amazing sauce ever. Had the wedding soup too. Also fabulous. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love this place very casual and laid back,the bartender rowe is the best when it comes to LONG ISLAND ICE TEAS...something to die for. The food is great also, it is a place worth trying it."}
{"text":"The main focus here seems to be the bar. I'm not a dri ker so that doesn't appeal to me. The food here isn't terrible but also not really something to write home about."}
{"text":"Incredible food. Their side salads always taste fresh, the pasta sauce is clearly homemade and out of this world. Can't come without eating a full basket of bread. Love. This. Food."}
{"text":"Good Italian food at a reasonable price..........some of my family don't like the Pleasure Bar, but they're just snobs."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Liberty Ave Italian restaurant. The food is above average for a very reasonable price.

I've tasted almost everything on the menu and haven't been disappointed yet.  They have the best fried mozzarella in the city using fresh cheese and hand breading it on site.

This is a great place that everyone should try at least once."}
{"text":"We went for a weekday lunch. The actual dining room is small and was only about half full. Lunch was served with Italian bread and butter. The lunch menu is about half the size if the dinner menu and had all the traditional Italian dishes. They don't have an official children's menu but they can name some dishes for you if you ask.
I had lasagna which was quite good but the potion was small. The sauce however was the bomb. Very good! It also came with a salad. A friend got gnocchi with the same sauce and the portion was a kettle better. My spouse got mafalda with penne. It was \"eh\". Noodles were overcooked. 
I would recommend this place for lunch but make sure to get an app to share BC lunch portions are small."}
{"text":"Great food great prices and wonderful wait service! We went today for the first time because we wanted to try somewhere different. Our waitress was awesome and quick. Our food portions were huge and the price was great. We will definitely be back for another dinner soon."}
{"text":"First time here for Lunch time. Seated fast, waitress was very pleasant and was pretty fast as well. Service of food was great and to top it off ... the food was Excellent!! My wife had the chicken parm and I had baked ziti .. food was hot. Plating was pretty nice too! I've eaten lots of Italian food and this is one of the better meals."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here with another couple a few weeks back for a round of birthday drinks. Kyle had heard good things about Pleasure Bar from several people, so he was anxious to try it. It was a Friday night around 11:30 and this was our first stop of the night, so nobody in our group was intoxicated in either appearance or reality. (This becomes important later.)

We walked in and were greeted by a rowdy group of three men hitting on a female couple nearby and playing lots of country music on the jukebox. So far standard bar behavior for a certain demographic and nothing to be too concerned about. There was one lone female bartender and she seemed sweet enough. One friend ordered a Blue Moon and the other a Yuengling. The Blue Moon seemed super overpriced, but my boyfriend and I were undeterred and ordered up with two Dogfish Head IPAs. Score! They were significantly cheaper. (I love whoever this bar buys their beer from at least.) Around half an hour later our friends wanted a round of whiskey shots and ordered two. They handed the bartender a $20 and told her of our intention to leave immediately after. They received their two shots and nothing more. We waited fifteen or so minutes, the shots were consumed, etc. Everyone was thinking hmmm $10 shots, pricey but okay...it felt odd but we were just going to roll with it when my boyfriend stepped in and politely asked if we had any change coming. The bartender smiled, turned on her heel, went back to the register and produced the change we were owed. (I believe it was $7 total.)

I have two problems with the way things are run at Pleasure Bar. One, that bartender was all by herself and was being horribly harassed by the group of men next to us. (As in they were screaming at her, calling her a bar wench, and using sexually derogatory language.) I saw one other female staff member floating around somewhere in the back, but overall she seemed deserted. I felt terrible for her in that situation. Two, not giving polite patrons change is understandable on crazy busy nights on packed out bars, but in our situation it felt suspiciously like she'd planned on pocketing the change and I don't think that's professional. The bar had a capacity for about forty people and she only had eight or nine individuals to deal with. Nobody else even ordered drinks while we were there. With the behavior from the other group I could see her being so upset that she simply forgot our change, so I mentally tried to give her the benefit of the doubt but it still seemed pretty off. We had already tipped generously after our first round, so she had no reason to assume we wouldn't do the same for the shots. If I ever come back here I just know I'll be watching my change a lot more closely!"}
{"text":"The name originally scared me, but the food was good. Not the best Italian, but I am from Boston and picky. The service was very good and I would return. If you are in the area, I would give it a try."}
{"text":"This place does not have good italian sauce it tasted like chef boyardee and my crab cakes were not cooked in the middle it was cold. I wont be back."}
{"text":"1 star for food, GROSS!
5 stars for plate glass window people watching!!!"}
{"text":"You want people to keep coming back here?  Keep doing what you are doing here.  A comedic performance will definitely keep me coming back.  I'm not even sure if the lady I saw behind/by the bar even worked there, but she definitely entertained me.

The atmosphere is light and fun inside making it feel like you are possibly at somebody's house party rather than at a bar.  I only came to partake in libations, so I cannot speak to the food here.  

This place seems to be a favorite haunt for the locals that live nearby as everyone seemed to know everyone.  It was like one big family get together.  Kind of like Cheers meets Central Perk."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I've lived in Pittsburgh for 6 months now and I've heard SO much about how Pleasure Bar is the greatest Italian in Bloomfield (aka the entire city, since Bloomfield IS the Little Italy here). I finally decided tonight that I had to try it for myself.

While the food is above average, the ambiance does leave a little to be desired. The evening started out with a bread basket, which was (oddly) comprised of three somewhat bland pieces of white bread and about 20 little squares of butter. Very strange. Even in my most gluttonous days, I find it impossible to average 6+ squares of butter per slice of bread, but maybe that's just me.

My dish, the linguini with house-made cream sauce and mushrooms, came with a soup or salad, of which I chose the broccoli and cheddar soup. As a vegetarian, I was pleased to see plenty of options on the menu for me to choose from. The broccoli and cheddar soup was rich and creamy, albeit a bit salty for my taste. The linguini however, was great. I could immediately tell the sauce was homemade - it had a certain fresh and rich flavor that pre-packaged sauce tends to lack. (Unfortunately, I'm sure the amount of calories I consumed in that dish reflected the amazingly rich flavor, but I'll just ignore that.) As pleased as I was with my own menu luck, I found my boyfriend's dish - the gnocchi with pomodoro sauce - to be a tad bit lackluster. The pomodoro sauce and the gnocchi itself were forgettable. While I loved my own dish, the lack of consistency throughout the menu makes ordering a bit difficult.

Overall, this is a pretty good neighborhood Italian restaurant that is priced rather decently. If you aren't adverse to a bit of cheesy mom-and-pop restaurant decor, I recommend it."}
{"text":"The Pleasure Bar is absolutely not a 5 star restaurant, but it gets 5 stars from me bc every time I've dined there I've left happy, full of delicious food, and not broke.

Everyone in Bloomfield knows about the Pleasure Bar, but I'm not sure anyone outside of Bloomfield knows about it.  It's a small neighborhood restaurant, the main dining room is small and it looks like you're in the banquet room of a Holiday Inn in 1985--but somehow the atmosphere is warm and friendly instead of dated and depressing.

I have never called ahead for reservations and i have never had to wait for a table and I believe this is only bc I've got lucky every time I dine there.  The restaurant is ALWAYS busy and for good reason--the food is great!

Is this authentic Italian food?  I have no idea.  I have an Oma and a Nain (german and welsh grandmothers, respectively).  Many dishes were served at our house growing up, nary a Pasta Pomodoro among them.  So while I do not know if this is authentic Italian food, I can tell you this food is the real deal.  It's really, really good.

Heres what we had to eat last night:

the tomato and mozzarella salad.  Its a real pet peeve of mine when restaurants don't use very ripe roma tomatoes for these kinds of salads.  The tomato NEEDS to be very ripe and acidic and I was initially disappointed when I saw just regular beef steak tomato's in the dish.  These were no ordinary tomatoes!  They were marinated and amazing.  The mozzarella came out in large slices, and the waitress had recommended I dress it with balsamic vinegar which I did and it was excellent.

My friend ordered the Italian wedding soup and I found it a little bland but he loved the soup.  It was the perfect ratio of pasta to broth and it was not heavy on the salt which is a good sign--you know the kitchen staff TASTES the food before serving it!  (not your food, they taste the food as it is prepared.  you know what I mean)

I ordered the Salmon del Mare as my main course, it was the special of the night and it was very good.  Broiled salmon topped with tomatoes, spinach, mozzarella cheese, and shrimp scampi. I asked for my shrimp on the side and I am very glad I did because I think they might have overwhelmed the salmon.  I thought they'd just put the shrimp on the side but instead they brought out a delicious shrimp scampi which was good and savory and garlicky...  mmmmmmmmmm i just had a moment.

the salmon was cooked just right--where it flakes but it's still moist and it was seasoned perfectly.  All of the ingredients were cooked so well I ended up deconstructing my dinner, and I had the salmon without any of the toppings, and then ate the spinach and tomatoes as if they were their own side.  A side of broccoli came with the entree and it was good but kind of unremarkable.  I mean, it's steamed broccoli.  It really didn't have a chance, considering it was brought out with the shrimp scampi.

My friend ordered the Pasta Christopher which had red peppers, chicken, and sausage mixed in with penne.  Full disclosure:  I'm freaking hate Italian sausage.  I'm german (American by way of Stuttgart, my German claims are legitimate!  Stimmt!) and I HATE spicy sausages.  I like sausage bland, covered in Senf (mustard), and made of ingredients you don't want to know about.

My friend found the Pasta Christopher delicious.  You're not going to leave the Pleasure Bar hungry, where he usually cleans his plate he asked for a to go box. 

We were too full to have dessert.

Our check came to $50, but $14 of that was beer, we each had a beer with dinner.

this restaurant is reasonable, and delicious.  If you bring a date here, they wont be impressed but they will be relaxed, have a great dinner, and you're not going to go broke.

I highly recommend this place and I wish more people knew about it.  it is one of my favorite dining options in Bloomfield.

{"text":"The Pleasure Bar has been in Pittsburgh forever.  My dad wanted to come here one day because he remembered coming here years ago, and we have returned a few times since.

I could not believe the prices on the menu the first trip.  This place is CHEAP.  We started out with the bruschetta, which was ok.  Not my favorite, but I think it was four huge slices of bread and covered in garlic and tomatoes.  It was a bit greasy for my tastes but still yummy.  Then, we split the stuffed shells ($8.50) and gnocchi ($9).  Both were fantastic, I'm guessing homemade.  Other trips we have tried manicotti, deep-fried zucchini, and all sorts of other things.  The portions are a good size, and you might even have a very small portion of leftovers.

The service is slow considering we are often the only people on a Saturday at lunch time, but who cares?  We are there to talk and hang out.  This place is great, and I'll come back soon."}
{"text":"..stopped by for comedy sauce last night to get out of the house. It was a nice time. The bartender was extremely friendly and nice. They had cool specials too. $2 domestics. I stuck with pop since i was driving. my bf ordered a couple Hoegaardens.. which i was so excited to see that they offered that. I sipped some of it and it was enjoyed! I didn't try their food but im sure we'll head back. The bar had a relaxed vibe.. loved it."}
{"text":"Awful. Just awful. My boyfriend and I went to dinner here last Saturday. We were craving Italian so we agreed to try somewhere in Pittsburghs little Italy. We looked around Bloomfield and decided on this place. With a menu boasting Italian favorites, we thought this would be great. Nope. He ordered the veal parmigiana and I got the seafood Alfredo. His entree came with a wedding soup that was ok...but when the server brought it, the crackers fell to the worn, dirty carpet and she picked them up and put them on the table...gross. Our food took forever and when it got there I was highly disappointed. My Alfredo was tasteless. No salt or cheese, just a bland béchamel. The shrimp were clearly previously frozen as well as the \"scallops\" that were tiny and rubbery. The veal was soggy and chewy and the sauce was sub par. We tried to push through but couldn't. We should have turned around when we saw the dated less then clean looking decor, but didn't. We will never be back and I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Don't expect anything special here. Most home cooks could outperform the food you'll get at the Pleasure Bar. Fortunately for them, I don't cook...but I can still recognize lazy cooking when I eat it. These guys are definitely lazy! The pasta is precooked, and the sauce is probably bought-in. Nevertheless, the food is edible, but definitely not worth $20."}
{"text":"I'd like  to comment on the food, but i couldn't get service. Came in waited 5 minutes to be seated, sat down waited 10 minutes for service trying to hail the waitress, went to the bar and waited for service with no luck. I guess my money isn't green enough."}
{"text":"This was really disappointing. I went out with three others on a Friday night to grab some dinner. Unfortunately, we were all pretty underwhelmed with most of the dinner. 
I'll open with the highlights. The potato balls were yummy. Crispy on the outside, creamy and cheesy on the inside. There were easily the highlight of the meal. Also our desserts  were good. We had a chocolate cake, tiramisu and the lemon berry mascarpone cake. The desserts were all flavorful, sweet and yummy.
The entrees, however, left much to be desired. The table order a penne Alfredo, penne malfalda, and the putenesca. I ordered the amanda pasta, which was a special. It was sauteed broccoli, zuchinni and sundried tomatoes in their aglio olio sauce.
Everything tasted like nothing. I'm positive the pasta water wasn't salted. Even the putanesca, which didn't include any tomatoes, had no seasoning, which seems like an impossible feat considering its historically a salty dish. Everything was just bland and disappointing. It literally tasted like the place has given up.
I likely won't go back, except maybe for some dessert, but even then, it won't be any time soon."}
{"text":"Top of my list for a late lunch today. While  attending the Italian festival in Bloomfield last September I tried the polenta and meatballs, with a meatball sandwhich! I love meatballs and these ones were well seasoned, juicy, and soaked in a great marinara sauce. I occasionally get cravings for these meatballs and today was the day. 

A couple of months ago I tried to go on a Sunday and they were closed. It was a cold, snowy Sunday so I thought they were closed because I showed up pretty late plus the bad weather. I attempted to go again today but to my dismay they are always closed on Sundays which I would have seen if I had checked my yelp app. BOOO! 

Three stars so far... because of the great meatballs! Points lost for being closed on Sundays. Who is closed on Sundays?? Crucial Lazy Sunday dining revenue is being squandered! They must be busy enough and don't need the extra business day. Wait for an update because I'LL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"After my first time at the pleasure bar I just say \"meh, it's ok.\" 
To begin our evening I called ahead to get our name taken down I asked how long is the wait for four people would be to which he answered \"it's going to be quite a while.\" then I proceeded to ask if he could put our name down and the  man on the phone sounded frazzled and hung up on me...rude.
After arriving we entered a fun atmosphere including a party of people wearing mustaches at the bar! Between arriving and being seated the wait was ten minutes tops! So much for \"quite a while.\"

Upon seating we decided to order a round of potato balls which were amazing! Be sure to order these of you make a trip to The Pleasure Bar. 

Unfortunately, the food went down hill after the potato balls. Combinations 1,2, and 3 were ordered and everyone had the same kind of reaction toward their dish \"it's not bad\" I think would be the most accurate sentence used towards the meal. All of the sauces were kind of flavorless and boring along with the pastas all being over cooked adding to the \"meh\" effect of the meals. 

At the end of the evening I gave The Pleasure Bar three stars for not necessarily being bad but not being good. I am willing to give it another shot and hope that it improves before that."}
{"text":"The BEST Italian food in Pittsburgh. Yep. I said it. 
Free comedy every Monday night at 9pm! $2 domestic bottles and well drinks."}
{"text":"Very bad all around. The service was very very slow, it took us 40 minutes to be seated when there was multiple tables available and no others waiting. There seemed to only be 3 people working in the entire restaurant including the bar so everything took extremely long. We had to ask to get drinks, utensils and menus. The waiter never checked on the table once. The food took too long. The food was awful as well. We asked for bread and it was extremely stale. We tired paying the check but no one would help us for a while. Never will I return, it was very very bad experience."}
{"text":"My daughter,  sisrer,  nephew, and I were in the mood for some Italian food so we decided to give the pleasure bar a try.   We arrived at 7:20pm and were told there would be a 20 to 30- minute wait; we finally got a table after almost an hour.   Over the course of the next 90 minutes we received some bread,  some cabbage water with a few little meatballs,  one odd- smelling cloudy iced tea,  and numerous claims that the food would be \"right out\".  After a two-and a half hour bout of frustration we had enough and went home hungry.   

I will never go here again.   The little bit of food that we had was awful,  and we never got or entrees.  Yelp need to have a zero rating for places like this."}
{"text":"Ah, Pleasure Bar. Yes, this place looks like it hasn't been updated for many decades. However, I find that kind of charming -- I imagine all of the steel workers of yore, boots dirty and hands ragged, gathering at the local watering hole after a long day's work to unwind with their neighbors and enjoy a cold pint and some good food.

Anyway, I digress. I've been to the Pleasure Bar several times, and I have always left relatively satisfied. I've never encountered any service issues, and the food has always been decent. Now don't get me wrong -- the food isn't super modern, light, amazing Italian cuisine. It is, however, good \"Pittsburgh Italian\" --  and by that I mean that many of their dishes are heavier, richer, and more dense. Yes, I just made up the term \"Pittsburgh Italian\", but for a city that puts french fries on its salads, I think it fits. For example, one of their more popular and delicious appetizers is their potato balls -- as the name suggests, these are deep fried balls of mashed potatoes. Delightfully crispy on the outside, and warm, smooth and creamy on the inside. Their gnocchi is delicious, but very dense -- it's not the light, pillow-y type of gnocchi that some other Italian restaurants serve. That being said, I have no problem with starchy, dense gnocchi. I often get it tossed with mafalda sauce, which is one of their signature sauces that is a combination of marinara and alfredo. Sinful!!  So yeah, their food is the type of food that is rich and delicious, but you're definitely not going to be running a 5k after eating it (then again, running a 5k is overrated anyway ;) ) 

So for what it is, I think Pleasure Bar's food is actually pretty good. However, the last three times that I've visited, I've had -- hmm, how to say this politely? -- \"intestinal issues.\"  The first time it happened, I thought maybe it was a fluke, but then I went again a few weeks later, and once again it was a gastrointestinal race to the finish home. I gave it one final try, but met the same fate.  So there is clearly something about their food that doesn't agree with me (and for the record, this doesn't ever happen anywhere else). To be fair though, it's very possible that my body is just weird, because in all cases my dining partners have not gotten ill.

So I'm kind of torn -- my brain wants to give Pleasure Bar 4 stars, maybe 4.5, because I really do like their food. But my GI tract wants to give them a 1 or a 2. So I'll split the difference and go with 3."}
{"text":"Not overly impressed with this restaurant for how much everything cost.
My beer was $10, which is crazy, even for a craft beer. I got a filet for dinner, and asked for it medium rare (the waitress said that wasn't going to be that bloody). It came out and basically looked like it had barely been cooked. The waitress was nice and fast though."}
{"text":"We just got back from our dinner at the Pleasure Bar. I ordered eggplant parmesan, starting with wedding soup. The soup was pretty good, although a tiny bit oily and a tiny bit salty. The eggplant parmesan came in a hearty portion with penne and pomodoro sauce. Their sauce is just the right amount of sweet and I enjoyed it. The eggplant was tasty and well seasoned, but a bit chewy around the edges. The prices are very reasonable, and the wait staff was friendly and approachable. The decor is a little PIer One but that's forgivable. 

I didn't deduct any stars for this since it's *technically* a special circumstance, but the only downside of the night was that the servers sat down to wrap silverware by turning the TV on really loud right behind us to the series finale of Lost, which I had planned on watching at a later date. Talk about a spoiler alert! 

Is this the BEST Italian food in the area? Probably not. But I'm also no expert on Italian food. In all, I found it tasty and a definitely a good value for the price."}
{"text":"had the potato balls.. sort of plain... lazagna was your typical lazagna... would go back if i had too.. but more places in the 'burg to check out first.  and kate our waitress was awesome.."}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid family run Italian place.  It isn't fancy or trendy, and the ambiance is very out of date.  But I love the old school local vibe.  They seem to get a lot of locals coming here.  The menu is extensive with a wide variety of pasta and other italian dishes.  I had a tortellini special which was delicious and portions were generous.  I wouldn't call it amazing but it was a solid good dish. Our server was fantastic, and prices were quite reasonable.  With all the super trendy modern places in town now, it's nice to have options like this still around."}
{"text":"When I lived in Bloomfield, Pleasure Bar was one of my staples.  They have a decent size bar, and two dining areas.  I've sat in all, and have had excellent service.  Honestly, I don't' recall ever being displeased with service here.  It's very Pittsburgh, so if you sit at the bar you can definitely catch a game.  The dining areas can accommodate groups, and I've seen many a family in here.  When they're busy it can get noisy, but not excessive. 
I have sampled just about everything on their menu.  A few of my faves:  Italian Eggrolls...mmmmm...i'm hungry just thinking about them.  Stuffed mushrooms are pretty bomb as well, and the Bruschetta Bread.  When it comes to entrees you can't go wrong with the pick your own pasta. Their sauces are homemade and oh so good.  My go-to is the pesto with angel hair.
 
If you're looking for a nice place, with good homemade food, this is it.

Bonus: During little Italy days they have a stand out front.  Do it."}
{"text":"The food here is very good.  I did find the service a tad slow but of all the italian places in this area I would go here first.

I had an italian hoggie that was very good and yes they do have excellent meatballs."}
{"text":"Don't get confused. This place is NOT fancy. NOT trendy.  This is NOT authentic Italian.  However, it is damn good Pittsburgh Italian food.  Sometimes you just crave the American version... 

The ambience is , old school, has not been updated in 30 years.  Walk through a bar to get seated. But it's part of the charm! 

They have solid bread to start, very tasty.  I always get a salad because the ranch is really good.  The bread dipped in the ranch is even better.  I generally get the chicken parm with fettuccine Alfredo instead of spaghetti.  Their chicken parm is super tasty and I like the mix of their tomato sauce with the Alfredo."}
{"text":"Wow! If I could give negative stars I certainly would for this place. I wanted it to be decent because they have an ok draught selection and seating outside in the summer. That is where the positive qualities end. Food tasted like it came from a microwave - but that is actually generous. This is an excellent candidate for kitchen nightmares, the place looks straight out of the 80's and not in a cool hipster way either."}
{"text":"My parents have always talked about the Pleasure Bar and how they used to go here when they were younger, but I have never been.  I have got to say that after going, I am defitiley a fan.  Nice portions, good food, and classic Italian enviornment.

When we got here, it was a pretty long wait, but luckily they have a pretty rocking bar here equipped with many TVs and plenty of booze.  Once we sat in the classic Itlaian looking dining area, our waitress came over, and we were starving.

The greens and beans were delicious.  I was suprised to find out it was only made with lettuces rather than traditional escarole, but it was delicious.

Entrees were also great.  I ordered the half portion of salmon, so I can account for portion size there, but it was great!  Asparagus was delightful.  My parents both got a pasta dish, and there was plenty to share because these plates were packed.  

I would definitley suggest this place.  You know it is a good deal when my dad gets the check and his first words are, \"That's all?!\"  So with that being said, it is pretty affordable too."}
{"text":"Very solid. Great portion on pasta and well prepared.  Best prepared pork chop I've had in a long time and sides were great.  Chris was our server and did wonderful job.  Nice location and very clean.  Decent decor. Would recommend."}
{"text":"In our travels back to Pittsburgh to see family whenI grew up, we would always go to the Pleasure Bar for dinner at least one night we were there.  I am sure that's where my love of Italian food came from.  Even going back farther than that, my parents went there in the 50's all the time. They knew the (owner?) Johnny Collinger and spent many a night having a good time there.  I remember Johnny still worked behind the bar when I went there as a kid in the 70's and he remembered me when I went there with my parents and would always make me a Shirley Temple with extra cherries in it.  (Good customer service is important to kids too! LOL)  So know that you know my family history with the PB, I will tell you that we just recently went back there with my mother who is now 84 on a recent trip back to PA.  The food was still very good but maybe not quite as good as I remember.  Nothing was bad and to be fair, we only split the eggplant parm sandwich and the meatball sub between the table.  The meatball sub was good, but I think the meatballs could have had a bit more flavor.  We also ordered an order of potato balls which used to be the family favorite back in the day. They were still good, but MUCH less cheese in the middle than in the past.  Pleasure Bar - add some more cheese to the potato balls and they will be a standout favorite on your menu and you could be famous for them.  I'd also like to see them bring back a past favorite sandwich called the PB Special. It was nothing more than a hamburger with Italian sauce on it and mozzarella cheese but the combination was outstanding.  I remember ordering that many times as a kid.  I like that fact that the bread is still made fresh (you can tell when you eat it).    The Pleasure Bar is still worth checking out for sure."}
{"text":"I have really good food here in the past (try eggplant rolatini) and the local bread is fantastic. Tonight, however, was just awful. Linguini Alfredo was supposed to be \"homemade\" but it was a far cry from the simple butter/cream/parmesan classic recipe. It was way too thick and absolutely tasteless. Also, my diet coke tasted funny and lack carbonation. My nephew ordered a grilled cheese and I thought they would use the local Sancholi bread, but no. ;(. It tasted like that yellow spray they use on grills. The waitress didn't take the coke off of the bill until I asked. I think of this restaurant as a staple in the neighborhood. I hope that my experience tonight isn't repeated."}
{"text":"Hosted a comedy event on short notice. Despite the short notice, service was great and the draft was even better!"}
{"text":"This little place has a surprisingly cozy upscale dining area in the back.  Serving traditional Italian dishes, it may be worth the splurge since the menu is a bit pricey.  I enjoyed the Fried Ravioli."}
{"text":"It had been 8 years or so since I last found myself in the curiously named (Mariani's) Pleasure Bar of Bloomfield, and that last dining experience was rather flat. With nothing to make for dinner, I brought Kay here one Friday afternoon for a post-workday meal and to get on with some unfinished business.  The peevish reviews the restaurant has received recently would not keep me at bay. 

I'll own up to having dealt with slow service, which was inexcusable considering that the dining room was no more than half-occupied. That notwithstanding, the above average food and familial ambience made up the deficit. 

Exhibit #1: The Italian Fried Greens. Amazingly, this was my first encounter with the traditional side dish. Embellished with chunky medallions of juicy sweet sausage, the wilted cabbage, chard, onions and heaven knows what else, made this a steamy salad that Kay and I shared ravenously. Adding some noodles would have turned it into haluski. 

Exhibit #2: A house salad. Dressed with a properly zesty house vinaigrette, I found it cleared my palate well for what was to arrive next. 

Exhibit #3: Gnocchi. Arriving at the right balance betwixt doughy and delicate, the alabaster, oval bombs of love, labor, and starch were coated with a fiendishly blood-rich tomato sauce that came close to conjuring mole, parsley also being added for effect. Customization entailed the inclusion of a mammoth of a meatball made from the purest of ground chuck with minimal filler. 

Exhibit #4: Spumoni. Served sundae-style with whipped cream, it made for a delectably creamy, pistachio-hued, and generously scooped ending to what was fine Italian meal. 

Kay and I basically ignored the so-so complimentary bread and the somewhat dated decor, relishing our dishes and the entertaining clientele aIike (the family sitting across from us would be good candidates for a reality television program) without a care. I suggest that my readers do the same and appreciate this venerable neighborhood eatery for what it is and for as long as it lasts.

P.S. The restaurant was clean during our visit, and we saw not one roach."}
{"text":"The food here was really solid - fresh, hot, yummy - everything you would expect from a decent Pittsburgh Italian joint. Had it not been for the excruciatingly slow service, I might have given the restaurant four stars."}
{"text":"i went to this restaurant saturday for the first time. my fiance and i went with a couple who live in bloomfield and go to this restaurant every two weeks or so. We walked in and there were already some people waiting for a table. We stood near the host area for 10 minutes. Several employees including the host walked passed us over a dozen times and never said anything to us. Finally my friend asked how long the wait for a table would be. The host looked at us rudely and said \"I don't know, 20 to 30 minutes.\" He was so rude and huffy. We left because of how unhelpful the staff was. I was excited about dining at this place before 10 minutes of frustration. We left immediately and went to the Thia restaurant down the street. It was excellent and they actually valued us as customers."}
{"text":"Great place for excellent food and outstanding service.  Don't forget to save room for desert and time to have a conversation at the bar.  Recommend this place for a pleasurable experience."}
{"text":"Food is great but the service at the bar is horrendous. 

Last few times we have went the bartender was unable to cope with even a half full bar. Went back in August on a Friday and asked if we could sit outside at one of the tables in front,  bartender told us yeah but we would have to come inside to order things because it's too busy. There were nine people in the bar section. It was nice out so we sat out there anyway. When our food was ready she knocked on the window and I had to go in to the bar and bring our food out to the table,  so it's got a nice authentic touch of waiting your own table yet paying someone else to do it. Eventually realized that she was doing this because she was screwing a waitress out of the table and didn't want to be seen. Classy. 

Same one was working the last time we went,  it was dead and she still couldn't keep up. Everything she said to anyone was prefaced with \"give me a second I have to get this for these people first\"  and then she would look at her phone. I mean I don't expect the best service on a Friday night somewhere but when it's dead and you can't even come close to keeping up what the hell are you doing. 

On the bright side we got bread with our meal for the first time in the last four visits this time so....  progress I guess. The food really is great especially the mafalda but man the service has gotten to where it isn't worth it."}
{"text":"I feel like it's kind of hit or miss here with regard to the food. There are times I've been and the food was so good I'd felt like I was inhaling it. Other times it's been bland and boring."}
{"text":"I've been making an effort to try more places in the city, and I had a chance to try Pleasure Bar last week. A friend of mine is a regular there and it came highly recommended. 

I have to be in the mood for Italian, but it was really good. Friend had the chicken noodle soup, which I had a taste of, and it was delicious. Ranch dressing is my default condiment, and theirs is to die for. I was dipping bread in ranch after I had finished my salad. Speaking of, the Italian bread was fresh and delicious. Even the butter was great, despite coming from those little containers with the peel off top. Then we had the potato balls. Come on, you can't go wrong with balls of fried potatoes and cheese. They were really good. I had chicken parm and couldn't believe the size of it. After bread, salad, and potato balls, I was only able to eat about 1/4 of it. While it was good, I thought that my friend's carbonara was better. That's what I'll be getting next time. 

I ordered stuffed shells with a meatball to take to my mom. She used to frequent Pleasure Bar in her younger days and said the food is as good as it was back then. I also got her a slice of chocolate cake, which she loved, although it's more of a dark chocolate. 

Service was great, but to be fair, it wasn't busy at 6pm on a week day. I agree that the decor is a little dated. It definitely has an Old Pittsburgh feel, which I don't mind at all. 

I'll be back the next time I'm in the mood for Italian!"}
{"text":"It's aight. Not too exciting, but not bad, either. 

It's a bit like going to Olive Garden to me (pricing included)... if Olive Garden had a sports bar area. The restaurant seating is fairly comfortable (and I like the lamps). 

I ordered the gnocchi, and, although it's OK, I swear I've had it better in at least 5 other restaurants. Note to self: Order something with meat next time. The hubby's meat pasta really was a lot better... and, thank goodness, he let me have a bite or my entire view would be based solely on the gnocchi.

With all the other rave reviews, I'm gonna have to take down names (of menu items) and be armed and ready to enjoy what others have before. But, for now, you have 3 stars in my heart."}
