{"text":"It was a cold Autumn night when a friend and I decided to meet for a long overdue dinner at Urban Restaurant on King St.    Located amidst the 'tourist strip' of restaurants, Urban is pleasantly not 'touristy'.  There's a lovely front room, but if you venture towards the back, you can step down into their more rustic 'fireplace room' - a cozy, more private setting, perfect for cold nights (...although there was a musty smell that hung in the air!).  They offer a prix fixe menu, which is somewhat limited, but their main menu is fairly extensive and true to the 'American Cuisine' the restaurant bills itself as serving.  I had the striploin, medium and it was cooked perfectly, with lovely roast potatoes and buttered spinach - a fabulous and much-needed dose of protein.  This meal, accompanied by a delightful rioja, definitely satisfied!  And to top it off, a decadent, but not heavy flourless chocolate cake - mmm....  A rather too attentive waiter made me feel rushed, although in fairness to him, I was having a bit of an indecisive day!  All in all, a good experience - I would return."}
{"text":"Are they still alive? I had a dealfind voucher for Urban, and tried meeting up with a friend who works in the area at Urban for lunch. I couldn't make a reservation. Their voicemail box was full. I couldn't reserve through OpenTable: their internet service was apparently down. Went there anyways, and a sign on the door said \"Closed Today.\" Anyone know if it was just Thursday or if it's about to hit the deadpool?"}
{"text":"The Hilton Hotel concierge recommended this restaurant.  He told my colleague to mention his name to the maitre d.  All it got us was a table pressed against a cold wall right next to the kitchen...thanks Hilton!  Anyway, the bread was promptly served with a very mild, somewhat watery hummus.  Definitely not impressive.  The service was quite slow even though the restaurant was not filled.  The staff was very responsive (except when I ordered my soda as we had to ask for it a second time).  The dinner prix fixe menu has several options.  For the appetizer, there was a dumpling dish that I wanted, but, of course, they were out of it.  I got the french onion soup instead.  I also ordered the beef bourguignon as the entree and cream cheese spring rolls with strawberry compote.  The beef was well prepared and the perfect serving.  A little more pancetta for the flavor contrast would have put this entree off the charts.  The cheesecake spring rolls with the compote had an excellent flavor; however, the spring roll wrappers were quite tough.  Overall, it was a good experience, and I would go back."}
{"text":"My fiance and I had dinner at Urban Restaurant on a Saturday night in August this year.  I had been there before but only for drinks.   When we arrived, we were greeted by two friendly staff.  It was a nice night so we chose to sit on their rooftop patio.  My first impressions were not what I remembered from my first visit.  The patio wasn't anything special.  The linens were worn and the plastic chairs looked like the ones in the back of my parent's garage.    We waited a good 10 minutes for our server to take our drink order.  I was getting a little impatient by this time but we didn't have anywhere to be so I didn't let it get to me.  When she brought my wine to the table, there was something floating in it.  It looked like dust or dirt.  I'm not sure.  Anway, I told her about it and she apologized and took the glass away.  I waited another 10 minutes for a new glass and when she finally arrived, there was something in that one too!     We ordered off of the Urbanlicious menu.  We both ordered the steak and frites.  I had a salad to start and my fiance had the soup.  For dessert we ordered something chocolate and something sweet.   The food was delicious!  However, the service has left me unwilling to return."}
{"text":"We walked into urban on new years eve and the first person we saw at the host stand appeared to be the manager. He was talking on a cell phone and blankly staring at us. We approached him for a table and he gave us no recognition whatsoever. Keep in the mind the restaurant was basically empty (the only empty one on the strip on new years eve).   We looked for a waiter or someone and eventually we sat ourselves near the front. We sat there for about 10 minutes and no one checked in for a drink order or simply just to welcome us. We felt very unwelcome and the vibe was quite cold and awkward.   When we had got the waiters attention the service did not improve. Throughout the night the waiter was very rude and inattentive (keep in mind it was the only table he was serving). At one point I was in the middle of speaking a sentence to him and he just walked away without a care.   The food was okay- definitely not worth the $200 bill we received for dinner, drinks and dessert for 2. There was a distinct lack of love and care in the cooking which any food enthusiast would notice.  The only saving grace was a cozy area in the back with a nice fireplace and Christmas tree.   All in all I would never return to urban and I would strongly advise against going there. I think they're a relatively new player on the restaurant strip and I wouldn't be surprised if they're gone very soon, unless they seriously change their customer service."}
{"text":"Stay away from their Kobe beef burger.  I got food poisoning from it.  I will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"Urban is a great spot located along a tacky strip of the Entertainment District.  Happily, during warm weather there's a roof deck that serves as a haven from the busy streets below.  The food is decently priced and decently tasty -- it's a reliable option for lunch."}
{"text":"They have some good dishes. Good for groups.  Trendy nice ambiance.   I always get the Indian salmon. its delicious. it's a little sweet and perfect."}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch with a couple of colleagues because we were in the neighborhood and was pleasantly surprised. For a restaurant in a row of tourist traps, this place was a few steps above the neighbors.  It was pretty crowded at lunch but our server was very attentive and friendly. They have a $20 prix fixe at lunch which had three or four choices for app and entree and two desserts. As the other two ordered that, and I didn't need a dessert I ordered soup and salad. The soup was pumpkin soup and was really tasty, if a little too hot. I had to wait until my colleagues finished their crabcakes before I could enjoy the soup. Probably the biggest problem with lunch. I survived! The salad was greens with beets, nuts and a mushroom filled pastry. I expected pears instead of the beets, but maybe I was confused? Regardless, the salad was amazing! I LOVED the dressing and devoured the whole thing.  Because my two lunch mates had ordered the prix fixe, they each chose a different dessert. One was pumpkin cake or bread with ice cream and was so freaking good! The other was a raspberry mold or something. It was good but nothing compared to that pumpkin.  We sat in the back of the front room, right next to the stairs to the other room, and I was facing the wall so don't have much to say about the room. I did try the washroom (down the stairs near the front door) and I must say they should invest in some air freshener. The toilets were so close to the ground I felt like I was in kindergarten! It was clean though.  All in all, a really surprisingly good meal. As every other restaurant in Toronto does, they do have a focus on local in season food (blahblahblah just feed me) and both the food and service were very good."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant designed for stupid tourists to overspend on crappy food and lackluster service.  The only thing this restaurant has going for it is that it is located on the 'idiot tourist strip' of restaurants where people who live in this city will never eat because they know exactly what they'd be getting into.  I've been to a few restaurants in the area (unfortunately) and Urban is by far the worst.    The manager of the restaurant is a total d-bag.  Our waitress couldn't get our order right after we sent back the wrong dishes twice.  When we complained, the manager said he'd look into helping us out on our bill and then took off in the opposite direction never to return.   TWO THUMBS DOWN!"}
{"text":"My steak was over cooked!!! For typical American food, it's over priced.  They also had trouble accommodating our group of 10. We had difficulty reaching the server. I didn't mind that we were sitting at the back of the restaurant, but service was poor.  You will find better options nearby."}
{"text":"Was chosen for our business team for a group dinner, and we had a large group so we were placed in the back of the restaurant (in the converted garage - but it was a nice garage :D).  I arrived a little bit late, so I sat down and ordered lickety-split, that was nice.   Picked the spinach salad with poached pears (good), the 'striploin' (just OK) and the grapefruit sorbet (a little too light in flavor - very little citrus taste).  They overcooked my steak, and they brought me the wrong dessert.   There has to be other contemporary steakhouse options!"}
{"text":"Urban uses extremely high quality ingredients in their very tasty recipes. The decor is pretty upscale and the service was fast and friendly!"}
