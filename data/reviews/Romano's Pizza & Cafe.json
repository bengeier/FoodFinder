{"text":"This place never disappoints. So the best hoagies in town and their pizza doesn't taste like anybody else is around they use different sauce I think it's homemade recommend anybody going"}
{"text":"Recently came here for a pizza.  The place is very quaint and they have a small deck outside where you can enjoy your food.  Looked very promising.  However, their pizza is rather bland.  The dough is like the cheap old Italian White Bread that they serve at mediocre Italian restaurants.  Overall, the crust is just soft, and not worth eating.  The pizza sauce is very slightly sweet, and not bad, but once again not really all that flavorful either.  The cheese was OK.... but nothing outstanding, definitely needs improvement.    I would be willing to give this place another try.  Maybe a hoagie, just because the place has some great small time charm.  The pizza desperately needs a makeover though."}
{"text":"Being born and raised in NHT, my family has always struggled to find that staple pizzeria where you can get a great, classic American pizza. Sure, there are plenty of places in the area, but they all seem to miss the mark and always leave something to be desired. They're always too greasy, flavorless, poor quality, etc.....   My wife and I have finally found that \"go to\" pizza place. Romano's is a place you can get a reasonably priced, classic American style pizza, and you'll never be disappointed. Every time we've gotten pizza from here, it's been tasty, not too greasy, cooked perfectly, and served with a smile!  We've always ordered out, and always just got pizza, but they sport a rather large menu of all your classic American take-out joints, and do accommodate eat-in patrons. They actually recently renovated their dine-in area, making additional room and adding a deck for outdoor seating.  Romano's is not trying to push the limits of culinary artistry, they're just trying to provide good Italian-American food, at reasonable prices. And in my opinion, they do this with flying colors."}
{"text":"Great service, great prices. The food was tasty and affordable. Friendly staff. I will definitely be back. We had the lunch special, 2 slices and a drink for $3.99, order of bread sticks and an italian sub. Everything was delicious and no I didn't eat it all by myself! Lol."}
