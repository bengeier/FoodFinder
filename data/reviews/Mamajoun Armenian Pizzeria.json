{"text":"This place is amazing. The breads are made daily in a variety of flavours. The sandwiches can be filled with your choice of fresh veggies. The staff is very kind and generous. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food. The owner was very friendly, and the food is amazing. We found the restaurant through blog.to and it lived up to our expectation. Definitely going back again to have some amazing thin crust lahmajouns....or mamajouns."}
{"text":"Great food at a decent price. I had an Armenian joun with some veggies (olives, tomatoes, onions on a half half zatar upon chefs recommendation) folded into a wrap and pressed as a panini, it tasted amazing and I had a meat lovers pizza, perfect in size, Armenian sausage had just the right amount of spice and the bacon was crisp on a thin crust. You don't expect something like this from a small shop in the borough. The staff were friendly and the place is clean. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Our favorites were the zaatar half and half joun (with suggested toppings: tomatoes, red onion, mint, and green olives) and the lentil balls. Owner was very nice and helpful with his customers. Wished we lived closer--we would come back all the time!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've tried the mamajoun, papajoun, soujouk joun, zataar and half and half but I think the soujouk joun is my favourite. Try it with scrambled egg  The prices are really good and you can take away a half dozen or dozen manajouns to eat later too. They also have this delicious imam bayildi for sale that I always pick up in my way out"}
{"text":"This place is great! My husband and I were very happy that we decided to check it out for lunch. He had the half and half (cheesy/zaatar) joun and I had the Popeye joun - the flavours were very different but both were very tasty. We also tried the bean salad, which was excellent. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Never had an experience like this at a restaurant before. I'm Italian, so I'm picky with my pizza and a friend of mine that lives in the Warden and Ellesmere area brought me here to try. It was a different pizza experience all together, and all I can say it was absolutely fantastic. Different flavours that I've never experienced on traditional Italian pizza and it was made into a sandwich with some good fixins. Trust me, give this place a try and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place online and decided to drop in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Ordered a meat lover pizza and bacon pizza with small lentil balls and eech salad. I was definitely enjoyed the food here!  We were given free pickled turnips and chili since it was our first time there. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Pizza's amazing and fresh! It's a small but neat place. They even make their own pita here! I tired their mushroom pizza. It's unbelievable!I love their variety! I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is delicious, fast service, big variety of dishes!! Great place"}
{"text":"Our first time here , the owner was very friendly and helpful and the pizza was great, we ordered the mushroom pizza simple yet flavorful Will come back again !"}
{"text":"Called the Papajoun its like eating a thin crust pizza with beef with your favourite toppings then flipped into a shawarma-like sandwich. It made for an interesting sandwich for only $4.   This place has some limited seating and is the second Armenian place I have eaten with the first one being on Victoria Park called the Armenian Kitchen. Both are equally located in deserted strip plazas so are a bit hard to find when driving by since you never think there would be anything good in those plazas.   This place is definitely brings a new taste to sandwiches and pitas since I had not eaten anything like I did here although the taste overall was average I am still looking forward to eating out here since its in my old neighbourhood that I frequent a lot."}
{"text":"The Armenian pizza was delicious and the service was fantastic! This was my first visit and will not be my last. Well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Our first time here - ordered take out and everyone enjoyed it, even the kids! We ordered 2 pizzas - meat lovers and cheese and papajoun wrap. Very generous with the toppings and loads of cheese! The dough itself is perfect as it's not too heavy with too much bread. The wrap was amazing as well with enough stuffing. Will definitely come back to try the other dishes and different types of pizzas."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday evening and it must be a popular place as most of the items at the front display counter were done... But not an issue if you're there to get pizza.   The space is small (about 4 tables to dine in) and the owner is very friendly and welcoming!   We ordered a goat cheese pizza and one that has jalepenos, cheddar, olives and tomatoes (can't remember what it's called... Both pizzas were delish and so thin and cheesy. Also ordered a side order of lentil balls which were okay but will definitely go back for the pizza!"}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place after reading some good reviews about it. Maybe I had too high of expectations knowing how well it was suppose to be but to be completely honest it was just...meh.   We ordered a Not-Yo (Nacho) pizza, Popeye Joun and lentil soup for 2 to share.   The pizza toppings included olives, jalapenos, onion and cheese. The outer crust was decent but the bottom layer under the toppings was kinda soggy.   The popeye joun was made into a wrap. It wasnt grilled well so it was still lukewarm inside. We were hungry and didnt care so we ate it anyway and didnt bother to get it reheated.   The lentil soup was bland. Kind of tasted like plain white congee mixed with cumin.   The prices are decent.. But I don't think I'll come back."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here and it was great. The food was innovative not afraid to deviate from authenticity mixing Armenian with Mexican and American. The place was a little small but very clean and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Armenian pizza!!    I was doubtful about this place in the beginning. The largest pizza is 10 inch. I wanted a large pizza walking in. But somehow the owner convinced us to give it a try. We ordered a eat lover pizza + their signature wrap. The owner even threw in a free beef wrap. The crust of the sandwich is thin and flaky. The pizza was packed with flavour. The owner was friendly.   Will be returning in the future !"}
{"text":"First time trying Armenian pizza and I like it!   The staff is super friendly and patiently explained the different menu items to us. We ended up ordering a Pomajoun (only available on weekends) and a mushroom pizza.  If you like thin crust pizzas then you'll enjoy Armenian style pizzas. Ratio of cheese to crust was 1:1 and it was loaded with four types of mushrooms.  The restaurant is very clean and the staff makes an effort to wipe down tables when customers leave.   It's located in a small plaza but we didn't find parking to be an issue.  I'm not in Scarborough very often, but I'm a fan of Armenian pizza and will be back!"}
{"text":"|| Must Try: Half'n'Half, Original Mamajoun   || Rating: (8/10) Food, (10/10) Service, (10/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (8/10) Presentation, ( 10/10) Cleanliness  || My Experience:    Note: The oven was broken when we went, so we were unable to try the pizza's in which the place is known for. Will update the review once we get the full experience.   Found this on Yelp, a great little shop that serves authentic Armenian food. We tried out a couple of Joun's during our visit. The owner was very friendly in explaining the most popular Joun's and the best toppings for them. He grilled them to a perfect crisp and offered an array of toppings to with them.   The restaurant is take out style, but has a decent seating area for small groups. The overall set up is very clean and straight forward, with everything labelled with the ingredients and components.   Overall, great experience, amazing value for what you get. Will return for the pizza!!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. We had two jouns and asked the owner to garnish them for us so he dropped mint and turnip all up in there - such unique flavours you don't usually get. We also got an eech salad with bulgur which is this dense, tomato-y pepper-y deliciousness. Everything was delicious and the owner is good vibes. Wish this was a chain!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations because of the good reviews but sadly did not enjoy the food. I ordered The Caesar Pizza with chicken and The Pepperoni pizza.   The Pepperoni was ok, but too salty. Why is my Pizza salty...   The Caeser was the grossest pizza I ever had in my life. I thought it would be interesting to try but MINT with pizza just does not work. The mint was so strong and overall it was just a weird combo of ingredients. Why is this on the menu? How could anyone eat this. Yuck."}
{"text":"first time at this place as a long time Scarberian. Converted upon first bite. The store owner made recommendation based of popular choices. Laid back atmosphere with cheap, yet healthy food."}
{"text":"The owner is so incredibly nice and the food is fresh even before closing time at night- tastes amazing! Great value for the price, I would definitely come back here and try all the different pizzas they have to offer!"}
{"text":"stopped in for a snack, well worth it.  Friendly service, takes a bit of time to get your order, at time of our visit only 1 person behind the counter.  This our first visit here, Mamajoun was listed in Scarborough Mirror as recommended places to eat.  Food : I would likely say most of the \"jouns\" are good for a snack for 1 person, 2 is likely more than plenty for 1 person to eat unless you're super hungry.  My wife and I were only looking for a snack so we had 1 joun each (1 ham & cheesy joun and 1 half zataar and have cheese).  If you are really hungry I would say consider their Pizza offerings.  Can't comment on the pizza's as of this writing since we haven't ordered a pizza here yet.  Will update of course when we do.  Drinks : If you are a diabetic beware of the Jarritos drinks.  Even tho the ones we got (mandarin and mango) tasted good, the sugar content is really high.  Note for foodie's with Gout : \"soujouk\" is a beef sausage made in house.  If you are managing your Gout flare-ups I'd recommend avoiding the items with \"soujouk\".  Would definitely come back for tasting other Joun offerings along with trying out some of the pizza offerings."}
{"text":"The \"Pizzeria\" term is misleading. It's basically Armenian flat bread.  They simply call it Pizzeria to cater to mainstream Western appeal. If you want a \"Italian\" pizza pie you will be be disappointing. Come with an open mind to what pizza could mean in another culture. Overall great food at fair prices with excellent service. I'm making this place my regular."}
{"text":"I was very pleased after my first visit to Mamajoun Armenian Pizzeria. After reading so many glowing reviews here on Yelp, I simply had to go out of my way to get me some.  I arrived at about 3pm and I was lucky to have the opportunity to speak to the owner Raffi about my first-timer selections since it was not busy at this time. Based on my cravings, my wife's allergies to tahini and Raffi's careful suggestions, I left with 4 Mamajouns, 1 Goat Cheese Pizza with Sun Dried Tomatoes and Mint and 3 Lentil Balls. Since I was bringing my order home across the city, I had two Mamajouns heated so I could enjoy them on the way and Raffi kindly instructed me how to prepare the others at home (he also provided me a separate bag with the condiments to keep them cool until I go there).  Everything was as delicious as I expected and each item was thoroughly enjoyed by myself, wife and kid.  I was happy to have experienced some authentic Armenian flavours in the Mamajouns and Lentil Balls and also familiar flavours in the pizza (although the mint really added a wonderful, unique touch to it). I'd like to suggest to those that might be apprehensive about Armenian pizza having too many exotic flavours, that if you stick with the \"Pizza\" menu here, you'll only get really, really good Italian-tasting pizza with quality ingredients.  The establishment itself is very clean and inviting with nice decor. You can see into the kitchen through a glass partition which was nice.   I look forward to returning to Mamajoun and trying several other items from the menu (although I'd order the same things again in a heartbeat).  \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" Five stars."}
{"text":"This is a true hidden gem. Must try! I live 5 mins from the place and didn't realize that I have one of the best middle eastern bakeries in Scarborough!  The owner is always working and makes you feel welcome. Try the red pepper pizza or the zaatar/cheese! Both are so good.  The only problem I noticed was the lack of staff. He needs to hire more people to keep up with the demand but that is a good problem to have as an owner!"}
{"text":"Yum, I can't wait to go back! Who knew Armenian pizza was so delicious?  On a recent trip to the local Home Depot we decided to stop at Mamajoun for lunch and wow, I'm so glad we did.  It's was a little confusing at the beginning but we told the lone employee that it was our first visit and he walked us through the different options.  We each had a signature Mamajoun (2 for $5 w/pop), sprinkled with lemon juice, yum! Seperately I had a spinach covered joun (I forget the name), this one I customized with my own choices, it was then wrapped and pressed like a panini. Topping choices included, fresh squeezed lemon or lime, mint, pickles, black/green olives, cucumber, lettuce, tomatoes, I'm probably forgetting some. My husband had the half and half joun. He usually requires meat on anything he eats, but was really pleased with all the flavours. Lastly, I had the lentil soup $2.50. It was delicious and I'm now craving it enough that I might need to find another excuse to drive out there for lunch.  Mamajoun is vegetarian friendly, quite a few of the jouns do not have any meat."}
{"text":"I came here to grab dinner, but would recommend it instead for lunch as it may be a little light for dinner.   Shared a few things: -meatlovers pizza. This was okay, but probably my least favorite of the lot. I'm not exactly sure what was \"Armenian\" about this. Maybe the bread was different, but the toppings  were pretty standard. It was $10, which was okay. -cheese pizza ($7). Preferred this to the meatlovers. They added some spices that complimented the cheese well.  -the joun was tasty and great value (around $5.5). I can't remember which type I got, but it had a good combination of flavors. The guy working there said that this is a similar size to the pizza, so this was the best value imo   Overall, I was pretty happy  with the food. I think I'll stick to the jouns on future returns."}
{"text":"Yum. What a tasty pizza they make. I got the one with cheese and beef sausage and it was delicious. You get to add whatever topping you like so I added some tomatoes, onion, olives and pickled beets with garlic sauce. They then fold it and grill it like a sandwich. What a great lunch, not super heavy but very satisfying. Looks like they had some nice salads on the side too, so will have to try those out."}
{"text":"This pizza place is really really good I got the Armenian sausage pizza and it definitely hit the spot The cheese was soft and the crust was thin. The sausage was really flavourful and the onion added a perfect balance to the pizza. The quality was there!  5 stars for the customer service and food!  I will be back here again!"}
{"text":"I love small businesses that focus on fresh food and customer service. Mamajouns is a good example of one.  The jouns (made fresh daily) come in several flavours and are all from $2.50-4.50. You pick a joun and you can make it into a sandwich if you want at no extra cost. They are grilled after, making a perfect snack for such a reasonable price. I enjoyed the lentil balls and eetch salad as well. Because I was eating in, the person working there added olive oil, green onion, and some spices, as well as free pickles on the side. The tahn drink was delicious! My friends who tried it as well had mixed feelings about the whole savoury yogurt concept but I found myself enjoying it quite a bit. It reminded me of kefir but with a slight savoury richness.   I was also a walking mess that day and accidentally spilled the tahn drink and the person working there was so friendly about the whole situation. He also came and replaced my drink afterwards cleaning it up. I came here with my friends and we were all blown away by the level of customer service that was provided here."}
{"text":"Mmm, who doesn't like thin crust pizza. Here, they can even make a crispy thin pizza sandwich for you. You can choose between a variety of fresh vegetables and condiments to go along with your pizza wrap. One notable ingredient is their spiced beef topping. It reminded me of a thin/crispier version of a pide. The Armenian apricot juice sold here is perfect to wash down your Armenian pizza wrap! Clean and friendly service."}
{"text":"If you like pizza as much as I do, and you want to try something different, come and try this place. Try the \"Half and Half\"! Half cheese and half zatar. Perfect balance! You add toppings and they toast it up for some crunch to the wrap. I added tomato and pickle. The owner recommended fresh mint with it and no sauces as it would take away from the simple flavours. I thought it was strange, but it actually worked! It paired well with the zatar and added a freshness to the wrap. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great fresh homemade food, Mehran ( the owner) in such a nice welcoming person,  I tried the Popeye joun and went with his suggestions for toppings( you can never go wrong with that),  pretty unique taste, they also have a lot of homemade condiments and saladsand breads that you can buy, will definitely go back to try their pizza"}
{"text":"Tried this place and absolutely love it. Price was amazing. The food was exceptional, the owner very friendly and an easy to park plaza location. The cheese and zaatar as well as their pizzas are amazing and very filling. Tried the lentil balls which was phenomenal too. If you haven't tried this, do so! You will love it."}
{"text":"Omg! So awesome. Get their zaatar and cheese and turn it into a sandwich. Fresh, healthy and delicious. Get the tahn drink. Also excellent and goes with the meal."}
{"text":"My Armenian friends say this place is really authentic!  Jouns are these tasty Armenian pizzas.  You can buy a personal size or minis for take home later.  They sell fresh and frozen.  The toppings can be somewhat different than your typical Italian pizzas, but the ones we tried (mamajoun and an Armenian sausage joun (forgot name)) were excellent.  The owner is very friendly and will recommend the toppings  Also, try their imported bottled cold pressed apple juice. Amazing juice and haven't found it anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Amazing Place.  Frequented this Spot, When working in Scarborough.  Very friendly guy and nice food.   Love the Zaatar"}
{"text":"HIDDEN GEM! mamajoun is literally the family run restaurant that I'd be willing to eat at on a weekly basis! This hidden gem is family-run, and the owner is the most nicest sweetest person ever.  On our first visit there, he recommended the favourites on the menu and what were the truly authentic Armenian dishes on the menu.  Personal favourite- the papajoun wrap (ground beef based) with the soujouk (Armenian sausage) filling!"}
{"text":"Awesome fresh healthy food. The salads are amazing.  The go to place for a healthy wrap.  I always go for the house toppings but you are free to choose your own.  Some of the wraps can be quite messy but tastes so good."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure trying an assortment of items. Mamajoun (topped with ground meat and spices), half and half cheese zaatar (herb) joun, red bell pepper joun and meat lovers pizza joun. For those who have never had a joun before, it tastes like a cross between naan and a thin crust pizza dough. The meat lovers was by far the best. On it is bacon, pepperoni and armenian sausage. What set it apart are the delicious spices that they use. I have no idea what they are, but they are delicious! The bf and I had lunch there for the first time and after finishing one meat lovers, we got a second one to go.  All the jouns (not the pizza jouns) have an option to be used as a wrap with fillings at no extra cost. The prices are pretty good too at $4 for a 10\" joun or $2.50 for an 8\" joun! :) The meat lovers is the most expensive item at $10.  The bf and I have already been back once and plan to eat here many more times. :)"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of their cheese pizza, which is super thin and tasty! One pizza can be split between 2 people, or if you're super hungry, you can have the cheese pizza for yourself.  I have tried their mamajouns and they are all delicious. Service is quick and the owner's always friendly.   One thing I wish is that they would have longer hours. Right now they are only open til 7PM."}
{"text":"Small, but lovely.   This place opened 4 months ago, according to Mihran, the owner. He explained that the tradition he is carrying on was started by his grandfather, although his grandfather's place was in Syria. He makes the jouns from scratch everyday, and there are limited quantities. As soon as those are sold out, that's it! Get there before that happens, people, cuz you don't want to miss out.  Decor is quaint. They have a counter where you can see all the various types of jouns for sale that day. Beside it there is a counter with all the salads and dips. At the register, they have preserves (blackberry, pumpkin, apricot, walnut) made in Armenia for sale. There's also some kind of music CD I did not investigate. Their salad option counter has a number of options (green olives, black olives, lettuce, pickles, hot peppers, pickled turnip, etc., and a bunch of the sauce options are made in house).   Had:  Tahn ($2.50) - I hope I didn't switch the h and the n in the spelling...This drink is a salted yogurt drink. It's not for everyone. I shared it with other people who likened it to drinking sour cream or drinking white cheese. It's not milkshake thick, but it's thicker than milk. It goes well with the mamjoun, adding almost a cheeselike element to it.  Mamjoun (1 - $2.50, 6 - $7.50, 12 - $15) - We bought six. We had half spicy and half not spicy. Usually, this is not doable because he makes them in half dozens, but his numbers worked out yesterday so we were able to try both. The spicy is not particularly spicy. It's a tad spicier than pepperoni. This tastes like a spiced pizza sans cheese. The dough used as the base is delicious and crisp. The sauce is extremely flavorful (did I detect a hint of cumin?) There's ground meat on there as well. You definitely want more than one of these. Mihran told me they also freeze well, so I bought some to go. Those I shared with enjoyed them as well.  Ham and Cheese joun ($5.50) - I ordered this one for my dad. I was surprised how much I didn't mind eating it after trying it. I'm not into ham and cheese. I don't like the taste of ham. After adding lettuce, black olives and tahini, this one was surprisingly good. I prefer the mamjoun and the spinach and cheese joun, but this one gets a solid 3/5 from me (I was expecting a sad 1/5). After adding salad options, Mihran folded this joun like a wrap, then put it onto the panini press to crisp it up. Crispy it was. Good amount of filling too.  Spinach and cheese joun ($5.50) - We ate this one like a pizza. We did not add salad options and sauces and fold like a wrap. At $5.50, it's not particularly cheap, nor is it expensive, but it's delicious. There's lots of spinach and lots of cheese. I'm not sure which I liked more, the mamjoun or this. Both I'd eat again in a heartbeat.  I've been told it's very busy Saturdays and Sundays around lunch, but on a Friday night for dinner, it  was fairly quiet. It was lovely. There aren't many tables, and not much seating, but it's a really good (and I'm pretty sure fairly nutritious) grab and go food for cheap!  Final thoughts: This place makes fresh food and fast. There's nothing deep fried (to my knowledge) and although i like meat, I appreciate that there's a lot of veggies here and Mamajoun's makes eating my veggies easy! I hope Mamjoun's is at this location for years and years to come, because I think I might just end up becoming a regular here."}
{"text":"Having read many good reviews about Mamajoun on Yelp, I have had it on my list of places to try for a few months now. I had originally thought it would be well out of my normal travels, and had also read that they tend to sell out of some choices early, so only made it there about 2 weeks ago when I was in the area. They were actually sold out of most of their jouns, so I had a bacon and cheese pizza as my first try, and it was very good. Thin crust, good size for one person to eat, everything seemed fresh. They also have an assortment of salads prepared, so I tried the Eetch, a very tasty mixture of bulgar wheat with tomatoes onions and red peppers. And the owner was very pleasant and helpful. So overall, a good first visit, with a total bill of $13.  Then I decided to stop in again this week on my way home from some errands on a day-off. It was only mid-day, so there was a good selection of jouns, sort of like a pita wrap with your choice of fillings which is then grilled in a press. I had a Zaatar joun, which starts with a thyme and sesame topping, to which I added extras such as pickled turnips and peppers. It is then folded and pressed right in front of you, leaving it very warm and flat when ready to eat. I was deciding on whether to have either the lentils balls or the couscous salad with it, but then got distracted and ended up with neither. So just $4 for my lunch.  Prices range from $4-7 for jouns and $7-10 for pizzas. Overall, definitely a solid recommendation, but better to go during the day for their best selection."}
{"text":"Such amazing food and even better service. The people who work were so great and friendly. We ordered mishmash joun and spinach cheese joun, as well as amazingly loaded pepperoni pizza and surprisingly flavourful lentil balls!"}
{"text":"I'm not a food scientist, but if you want a life changing food experience, look no more because these guys ARE food scientists. Get in your car, start driving, you'll have no regrets, then order some to go for the rest of your family; don't be selfish!"}
{"text":"I tried Mamajouns based on all the great Yelp reviews and wasn't disappointed.  Fresh ingredients, clean and tidy seating area and friendly service. I had a joun which was delicious. I'll definitely be back to try the pizzas!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and super friendly owners. Try the mamajoun, meatlovers pizza and mushroom pizza."}
{"text":"This my food, i know it, i grew up with it & i love it! I kept hearing from so many friends & family how delicious Mamajoun was. To be honest, i already had my \"go to\" place for (lahmajoun) Armenian pizza, so was quite reluctant to try it. After months of hearing about it, that quickly changed. Recently i was downtown & heading home with my hubby and kids just after 5pm. We were hoping to stop in to our go to place to place an order, but found out they were already closed. I suggested to my hubby that we stop in to Mamajoun and check out their Lahmajoun since we had already seen their menu online and to be fair everything did look quite good. We got there just before 6pm, so they were already sold out of 12 packs of Lahmajoun. While we were waiting and trying to decide on a pizza to order, the owner was kind enough to make us 1 fresh to enjoy while we waited for our pizza order. OH MY!! Super delish and seasoned to perfection! His dough is thin enough that it crisps perfectly and has just the right amount of meat, tomato & seasoning added on top. I was in heaven!! We placed an order for Lahmajoun to pick up the following Saturday as well as a pizza that we ate there with the kids.  You can eat there or get take out and they have more than just Armenian pizzas on their menu. They also offer vegan options, salads, hummus etc.   Make sure you call ahead when ordering 1 dozen or more. To reheat at home i set my oven or small oven to 300 degrees and place  2 Lahmajoun together meat facing in and heat on a baking sheet with parchment paper for 7-9 minutes. That way the toppings don't dry out and the dough tastes as fresh as it was right out of Mamajoun's oven!  It's best to call the a few days in advance or even the day before to place your order when ordering a dozen or more and you can arrange pick up time. This is the norm in most places that sell large orders of Lahmajoun.  In case you're wondering, i don't go back to my previous go to place anymore. Yes Mamjoun is a bit more expensive at $15 a dozen - but taste it and you'll see that it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Always up to trying new kinds of food. Walked into this bright and clean eaterie and was greeted warmly. I liked that everything was well organized and labeled with the name and ingredient list of the item. Tried the Popeye (spinach) joun with tomato, onion, black olives with the house dressing and hubby had the Soujouk (sausage) joun plain. They were both tasty with lots of strong spices and cheese. Definitely an affordable and filling midday meal but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who likes their food mildly spiced."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, well lit location with large windows. The music is usually blaring top 40's or rock, I would expect something more unique from a place like this. The menu includes interesting pizzas you won't find everywhere. However, I think the zaatar and cheese is the jewel here as well as the Sujuk (Armenian sausage a bit spicy). The also have a good selection of imported products, teas and drinks from Armenia/Russia. The food is delicious however, like many Toronto restaurants the portions are on the small side for what you pay. Bigger portions would have resulted in 5 stars from me. Still worth trying."}
{"text":"First time trying jouns and I loved them!   Came in around 7:30pm and there were only a handful of jouns left. This was party attributed to the fact that they're so damn popular but also because the oven wasn't being cooperative that day.   Ordered the Popeye (spinach) half and half ( half spices, half cheese) and the Philly ( beef, onions) jouns. Three jouns was just right for 2 people with big appetites. The Philly was the best by a mile. The beef was plentiful and the sautéed onions so sweet. I love my meats what can I say?  The way it works is that you pick a joun (thin pita like bread with pretopped toppings)then you choose from a mixture of veggies to put inside and finally it ends up in s panini press and comes out hot and crisp.   The ingredients were very fresh and I later learned that the beef is sourced from the next door butcher every morning.   Also tried the Tahn drink. It was Interesting. Salty and tart with a very intense yoghurt taste. I didn't love it at first but I think it grows on you! We were told it goes best with the mamajoun (topped with ground beef and various spices) It's their most popular joun so no surprise that it was sold out. I will fo sho be back again to try that pairing.  Apparently people buy the mamajouns by the dozen and it's a time consuming process to make so it always end up selling out. If you want guaranteed mamajouns do go early in the day or even preorder!  Last but not least, the service was excellent. Owner was very friendly and patient when we were indecisive choosing what to order and gave us lots of good recommendations."}
{"text":"I still go here a lot, I'm still in love with that hummus but he is always trying something new which is worth a try.  Whenever I drop by I always get something new on the side and have never been let down.."}
{"text":"Biting into ooey gooey cheese my heart skipped a beat.  I decided to try this place after reading the rave reviews about it and the fact it's in my hood.  It's a small place with a few tables where you can eat in, but more of a takeout place.  Not being familiar with Armenian food I can't say anything regarding the authenticity of the food, but it's good food and that's what matters in my book.  You can get pizzas or smaller jouns here - they make a limited number of jouns and my lunch time some were already sold out.  I got a half and half - cheese on one and then zataar on the other.  You can then have the option of adding toppings (onions, hot peppers, tomatoes, olives...etc..etc).  There is no charge for these toppings but I believe if you want to add chicken pieces it's an extra charge. Jouns are meant to be eaten like a wrap - it's a really thin crust (think thinner than naan bread).   I added some toppings on the cheese side and left the zataar side alone and ate it like pizza slices.  I didn't particularly care for the zataar one only b/c it felt like I was taking big bite of pure spice in my mouth, but I liked the cheese one.  The jouns are pretty cheap - all under $5 which makes a great snack or lunch.  They have bigger pizzas that are still decently priced - I believe depending on the pizza in the $8-10 range.    The staff are so friendly  and helpful in answering any questions.  Just don't ask them if they know the Kardashians!   They also sell some preserves/pickled items in the front but I didn't really investigate what they were or prices.   I can't wait to try one of the pizzas they look so mouth watering.  The only con is that I believe they close early - around 7 or 8pm."}
{"text":"If you love thin crust pizzas, this place is for you!  I tried the Goat cheese pizza and the Meat lovers pizza, they were both delicious.  I particularly love the spices on the pizzas. The goat cheese was really light, not too pungent for those who are not into goat cheese. The joun on the meat lover pizza made this meat lover pizza extra special.  Not much seating unfortunately. It's more of a take-out kind of place. It could do with a few a side table with bar stools along the window."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food.  I tried a few different pizzas there and one was better than the other.  Everything was fresh and made right in front of you. And of course it doesn't hurt that this place is owned by the cutest couple with the friendliest service."}
{"text":"love love love their lahmajoun pizza sandwiches! oh man, i found this place last spring when i was pregnant and then i moved to etobicoke but now we are back in scarborough I definitely need me one of these again! The owners (husband and wife) are super friendly... The man was usually there and you can definitely feel the pride and love he puts into all of his dishes. He will tell you all about his homemade dips and salads which are all also delicious!"}
{"text":"Good service from the second you walk in. Owner is super nice and will walk you through the menu.   Going in - the food is super tasty. We ordered the cheese and the ground beef. Super delicious.   Going out - look after an hour I felt super dehydrated and thirsty. Drink lots of water with your mama joun pizza.   All in all was a great experience but do stay hydrated cause the pizzas are quite dehydrating."}
{"text":"Dropped in here, for my first time, after a 2 hour Rouge Park ramble with a close friend, so we both had good appetites raging. He and his wife had discovered this gem a couple months prior. He thought it would make a good alternative to our usual Scarborough post-walk budget restaurant venues, ViPei on Kingston Road and Johnny's Shawarma on Kennedy. Well, he was right, this place is dynamite! We both had what I would describe as a generous, personal-sized ultra thin crust pizza, his a meat-lovers with bacon, pepperoni and Armenian sausage, mine with Italian sausage, both perfectly baked (well done), ready in a few minutes and delicious.  Those pizzas are at the upper end of the price range, at $10 each, but there are two sizes of joun (thin flat bread, like a small pizza - $4 for a 10 inch, $2.50 for 8 inch) and an assortment of ultra-fresh toppings, mostly vegetarian, to make into a wrap that is finished on a pannini press, to eat out of hand; or to have as a pizza-style meal or snack, depending on your appetite. Or you can go with the prepared joun, all made in-house, with zataar, mixed cheese, cheese and spinach and many other options.   There are a few tables and a counter with stools, to eat in, or you could opt for takeout. As pointed out in another review, at the moment they are only open until 7:00 PM. Well, do what you need to, to get here when they're open! The food is that good."}
{"text":"Being a big fan of pizza and reading all the great reviews I definitely had to try this place.  Not a hard place to find as the building and plaza are very noticeable regardless of which direction you take. The interior is small, but clean and well organized. It has the overall look and feel of a great restaurant.  I've never tried Armenian food before so I had no idea what the menu items were besides the pizza. Don't get me wrong, it isn't hard to read, but I had no idea what was in them. Noticing I was lost and confused, the owners greeted me and walked me through the items. As I placed take out and began to wait, they gave me a sample of one of the freshly baked joun....it was amazing to say the least. Once I got my order they shoved a bunch of coupons into my bag and thanked me. Now onto the food!  The spinach and cheese papajoun is great. Light, crispy, fresh, and not overwhelmed with too much of everything. Good balance of cheese, spinach and spices. None of those weird middle or end parts with nothing but dough.  The meat lovers pizza is my ideal pizza. Full of pepperoni, bacon and sausage. The dough was thin with a little chew. There was little crust, which I like, that was crispy and added a new texture to the pizza.   PS. the couple/owner must be really good at charades."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night. Their famous half and half zaatar joun was sold out. But I did try the one with the sausage ( forgot the name) the owner is very nice. He suggested which topping would be best suited for the joun. Going in I really thought it would be like pizza but it was more of a doner. Don't get t wrong it was very good  I was looking at the packaged joun and asked what the ones to take home was and he was nice enough to let us try half of it.   Over all more like a snack but good to try out. Would go back if I was in the area. However one would not be filling and I'm a short Asian girl..."}
{"text":"Me and my gf had the papajoun and the newly established popeye joun. I must say, I love the dough, it makes for thin and crispy delicious pizzas. The salad I had was something different, but I liked it. The owner suggested I wrap the grainy salad in Roman lettuce for extra crispness. The prices are very reasonable, the owner is cheerful and friendly. All in all, we are looking forward to our next visit. It's worth trying it out. You can buy a dozen of those mamajoun pizzas for $15 and warm them up at home in the oven."}
{"text":"The pizza is very good . I thought it is America pizza but actually it is from Armenian pizza . The owner is super friendly . I like this place very much!"}
{"text":"I was amazed by how well the pizza tasted ! My favourite was the goat cheese with sundried tomato & mint. A unique combination which was delicious. The owner was friendly with great customer service.  A definitely a must go to!!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, great tasting pizzas. I can  see why this is a Scarborough staple. Would gladly return for seconds (and thirds...)"}
{"text":"Pepperoni pizza was really good not the best I have tried though. Rice pudding was amazing."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times now and I'm torn on my star rating.  Negative -nice looking store but food displays don't look appealing.  -pies are too oily I believe I comes poorer quality cheese -no good drink options -flavours are a little too strong for me  Positive  -I respect the effort - staff are very friendly and seem passionate."}
{"text":"This food truly tastes like its family made. The owners jouns are delicious and fresh and you can really see the care he puts into his business. This is a great place if you are also looking for vegan options!"}
{"text":"I could eat these all year - January to Joun to December!  Lahmajouns are 10\" flat pieces of dough with various toppings added on it. They're then rolled to make a sandwich and consumed. This is usually followed by moans of pleasure and satisfaction.   The key thing here is they make everything fresh. The owner says he wakes up extra early to make everything fresh each day. He usually runs out by the end of the night so you have to be quick! There are always different specials and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.   I've tried a number of different items and I've always left satisfied. I think my favourite are the Philly Joun and the pesto pizza. The Philly Joun is what it sounds like - a Joun with all the components of a Philly cheese steak. Load it up with some other toppings and you've got yourself a meal. Try it with the yogurt drink - it can take some getting used to but it really compliments the flavours of the Joun.   The pesto pizza is delicious although the taste can be overwhelming. This is probably not a huge concern for most people because I sat down and ate the whole thing in 5 minutes.   All in all, 5 stars. The trifecta is present! Taste, cost, and portions. The service is great as well. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I really like the lahmajoun's, they are one of the best i've tried in the city. My hubs is Armenian, so i've tried a lot of Armenian food & pizza. If you have the chance to get one fresh & warm straight out of the oven, you won't want to eat these anywhere else. (sprinkle a little bit of fresh lemon juice on it - so delish!). Yes they are small and not a meal in itself, but who can eat just one? lol! We usually have them with a salad.  Pizzas are out of this world and must be eaten at the restaurant. Ingredients are so fresh and everything is made with such care but....  My hubby picked up an order a few weeks ago of 2 dozen. I had a couple of issues with these little discs of heaven. First thing that bothered me was the parchment paper between each one. it is SO thin and so small that it was nearly impossible to separate them the next day after putting them in the fridge. They were very glutinous and each one fell apart when i tried to separate them, they became shredded. I also froze 1 dozen and had the same problem once they were separated after defrosting. I even tried when they weren't quite defrosted and couldn't even separate them at all. Not sure if they stacking & bagging them while they are still really warm? That would explain them being so glutinous.  Haven't had that issue with other places i buy from. They cut the parchment the same size as the lahmajoun's. No tearing, no shredding and no issues. Wish they would do the same at Mamajoun at $15 a dozen.   That was the 2nd time in the last few months that we've had that problem. It makes it not worth even buying anymore. Especially if i buy them for guests coming over. I'll give them another chance but if it happens again, i'll be buying my dozens from somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great Mom and Pop lunch spot in Scarborough. Think what would happen if a sandwich and a pizza had a baby. Thats Mamajoun!!"}
{"text":"We loved it here! Armenian food is hard to come by and our cravings for lahmajoun were finally satiated. The service was so friendly and accommodating and they even have wifi here. We got a few extra pizzas to go so that our friends could partake as well."}
{"text":"Exactly what I picture great tasting pizza should be. Greasy with alot of cheese and that fresh taste of tomato sauce in between with a little kick of pepperoni and a little bit of whatever oil that is on the pizza is so good. Definitely recommended for sure taste better than most franchise out there."}
{"text":"Very delicious pizzas and jouns (flatbread wraps. We also enjoyed the salads! The owner is friendly and nice"}
{"text":"Best Armenian pizza in Canada!!! Better than Montreal. Love it. I love telling my non Armenian friends about it to showcase our style of pizza. Very friendly staff. Great prices. Highly authentic and yummy twists. Very accommodating. Love it"}
{"text":"Dropped in here for lunch after seeing the great reviews.  Let me say this will not disappoint anyone looking for an awesome change to the normal 'pizza'.  The jouns are just awesome and with the toppings and crisping on the sandwich press.... oh man, my mouth is watering again just thinking about that delicious tasty food!!  I was lucky enough to find some homemade rice pudding they sell to follow up the star of the meal and it was perfectly made with just the right amount of sweetness and rice cooked properly.  We'll be coming back to this gem!"}
{"text":"Daughter had a soccer tourney in Scarborough on Canada Day, most places were closed but found this gem in the rough.  Eat in or take out counter.   We ate in 6 of us at a table.  Amazingly good pizza and the rest of the food looks fantastic as well. Can't pass up on the Meat lovers pizza.  The Armenian meatball toppings give it a sensational sweet-spicy kick that makes your taste buds beg for more. Crust is perfect and toppings are plentiful.   Also had the mushroom pizza which was incredibly delicious.  Picked up a jar of eggplant on my way out to try on my own homemade pie.  If you have a love for the pizza pie You won't be disappointed at MamaJoun Armenian Pizzeria."}
