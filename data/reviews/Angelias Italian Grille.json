{"text":"Good local pizza shop. The food is good as long as they fully cook the pizza. It seems to me that they raised their prices recently too. I'm not complaining because they are the most consistent of the local pizza joints. Good wings but they need to have more than one size hoagie."}
{"text":"Pizza is way to soggy like old poop that been sitting in the rain for far to long and also tastes like rotten broccoli"}
{"text":"Ordered some pizza from there tonight. Very, very tasty. And delivery time was quick."}
{"text":"Love to eat at Angelia's. Very good food!  Great service. A very comfortable family friendly place to have pizza, hoagies, pasta, wings, etc.  The Calzones are the best in the city!  Also they have a large variety of beers!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Especially Wing Nite! They are fabulous!  Pizza is awesome! Servers are quick and friendly. All around good atmosphere. And the prices can't be beat!"}
{"text":"The food is always very good and the service is super friendly. Not always the fastest service, but who goes to a pizza/Italian place when they want a quick bite to eat?"}

How could there not already be a review for this place?

Angelia's Italian Grille is not in a place that's really convenient for me.  Yet it is still a place to which I return almost religiously every Tuesday night, with a good friend of mine.  

\"But why, Dave? Why is this the best wing night ever?\"

  $7 all-you-can-eat wings.
+$2 Yuengling.

  $9 ticket to happiness before tip (and make sure you tip well!)

Their wings are above reproach.  They're not those annoying, hard-to-pull-apart, full wings, but they're also not those tiny little how-will-this-ever-satisfy-me wing dings either.  They're separated for your convenience, and meaty for the protein-hungry caveman inside you.

The flavor selection is not wide, and there's nothing there that even comes close to satisfying my need for sheer burning spiciness, but all you really need are the hot garlic parmesan.  Never have I had a wing with a better blend of full, cheesy-spicy-garlicky flavor than the hot garlic parmesan.  If you actually find a way to tire of those (sometimes it's all I order,) the barbecue and cajun flavors are nearly as orgasmic.

Of course, what I like the best is the cost.  Even on the tightest recent-graduate budget, Tuesday night at Angelia's is affordable.

Normally at this stage of the review, I list downsides.  But I can't think of any.

And then the \"downsides\" part is followed by a call-to-action.  I'll see you there next Tuesday.

No really, I'll be there.  You should, too."}
{"text":"Went to this place a couple times. The first time the pizza was undercooked. The next time we got a pizza, we asked for it well done. It was burnt and tasted horrible.  After that we gave it another try, we got the hoagies and they were horrible. Will never go back"}
{"text":"I hate to be a jerk and usually will keep my mouth shut if I have nothing good to say but the price you pay for a \"medium\" pizza is outrageous.  The average size of the slices were no bigger than a chicken wing, I'm not even being dramatic, check out the picture.  

We ordered a medium spinach pizza and 12 garlic parm wings.  The wings were ok but slightly over cooked and didn't have much flavor.  Like I mentioned before the pizza was pretty much personal sized.  The only reason it's getting two stars is because the flavor was actually decent."}
{"text":"You guys just suck. Waste of money. I will let everyone know.
Can you please send warmer beer?"}
