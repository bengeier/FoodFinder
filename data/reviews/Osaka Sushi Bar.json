{"text":"Been a faithful client for more than 10 years. very good food. Consistent quality, freshness and creativity of sushi dishes. Try the specialties, the \"ocean gratine\" as an appetizer and the \"delice Osaka\" for desert. Ok service and ambiance but very good sushi experience! And it's a bring your own sake/wine..."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, a bit pricey but the quality is beyond compare! The people working there are super friendly as well."}
{"text":"Excellent variety of sushi prepared to perfection. Beautifully layed out in eye catching colorful arrangements. So good. Really and truly delicious. Service is friendly and warm. Always perfect and very reasonable."}
{"text":"Sushi was sub par in every way. Cost 96$ for two people and I could have eaten better at an all-you-can-eat sushi place like Kanda for 45$. Service was very slow but expected since there was only one waiter working, and only 6 clients in the entire place (on a Thursday night, mind you!). If you've ever eaten at a top-tier sushi bar then you will not like this place. Would avoid."}
{"text":"The sushi was fresh and delicious. Many choices. We arrived late and could not have the Table D'h√¥te so we had the shrimp tempura. The avatar roll was so amazing we will definitely go back for that. It's a byob and very cozy restaurant. Just a little pricey."}
{"text":"Super slow service when there isn't that many people. Expensive prices for average quality hot food and sushi. Servers never came by, had to keep getting them. Avoid like the plague if you value your time and good sushi. There are much better sushi places out there (Mikado, Fuki Sushi, Sushi Do...)"}
{"text":"Great service, great food and awesome company!  Very polite no rushing and we were able to enjoy our meal.  Will be visiting again!"}
