{"text":"My friend and I stopped here when our other 2 restaurants nearby were full. They were very accommodating and found us a table even without a reservation on a very busy evening. The food was a bit sparse for the cost, but the food was absolutely exquisite! The harmonious flavours complimented well the visual aspects of the plate. The carrot purée was my favourite part of the lamb dish. And The Maple dessert was heavenly. Fine dining at a fine restaurant."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed by the food. Not exceptionnal. I ordered the burger and it was not bad but not very tasty. The fries were good but the red coleslaw was weird... The service was good, the waitress nice, however I found the owner cold... What a pity"}
{"text":"Funky cool ambiance. Outdoor terrace available. The Piri Piri chicken was perfection! Loved it. The entrees were delicious too but if you have them as your meal take three as they are small. Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Midi tranquille à Saint-Henri. Quoi de plus réconfortant que d'aller manger au 3734. Accueil chaleureux, service impeccable, nourriture excellente. Notre menu : accras de morue, poulet portugais, morue et beigne maison. Un délice qui tient en éveil nos papilles gustatives, léger et fondant, surprise et présentation exceptionnelle. 
À la prochaine"}
{"text":"Super cute brunch place. Really spacious. I tried their salmon and latke brunch. It was delicious. The salmon is almost raw but it goes beautifully with the perfectly fried potato latke, poached eggs and mustard sauce. The eggs are soft and so perfect! The dishes look as good as they taste. Definitely returning to try their benedicts."}
{"text":"Since its opening, I have been wanting to come here. It's a nice and spacious restaurant which serves brunch and supper. We got a nice spot to sit by the wall on the couch. One wall is decorated by a large water paint, another wall has beautiful photographs of different world's objects.

The service was very amiable, cordial and helpful. Our waitress answered all our questions with good knowledge. 

My sister had pain perdu (French toast, chocolate sauce, vanilla whip cream and mix berry fruits) with fresh squeezed orange juice. I had piri piri chicken with arugula salad and breakfast seasoned potatoes with a cup of cappuccino. Both of us enjoyed our dishes tremendously. In the end, the courtesy of the restaurant we had a mini fruit salad. It was delicious! 

Lovely place; great service and excellent food!"}
{"text":"Une perle à découvrir sur se bout de rue moins fréquenté qu'à l'est d'Atwater. Tout est impeccable et la bouffe est simplement succulente. Allez y sans hésitation!"}
{"text":"Quel bon repas! 

Accras de morue et rémoulade excellent !
Loup de mer sur nid de purée d'artichaut à s'en lècher les doigts
Poulet au Piri Piri, juteux , tendre et surtout savoureux
Tomates de saison 
Couscous de légumes au cumin très goûteux

Et que dire des frites croustillantes !

Service courtois, aimable et avenant

Vin abordable

Rapport qualité prix excellent,

Y aller c'est l'adopter!!!

Nous étions 11 personnes et avons toutes apprécié!"}
{"text":"Decevant. Le décor, la musique et l'ambiance sont bien. Mais ce qui s'est retrouvé dans l'assiette m'a laissé sur ma faim. Le poulet piri piri était ok mais la quantité était famélique (ne faites pas un détour, il y en a du meilleur ailleurs à Mtl) et les frites de type cheveux d'ange goutaient la mauvaise huile et étaient trop graisseuse.
Ce resto n'a pas grand chose de portugais, même pas de poisson au menu."}
{"text":"We came here on a Tuesday night and to our surprise, it was empty 1 The whole night we were the only table there which, I'm not complaining about since we had the restaurant, the waitress and the chef to ourselves. The service was definitely perfect considering that factor, and so was the food. It is on the pricey side for the small tapas you get, but the flavor is definitely there. The piri piri chicken is unique, didn't taste any like this one in Montreal. t's good that they change their menu often because being 4, we ordered almost all the 10 tapas that were listed."}
{"text":"Ancien local du Henri Saint Henri maintenant nommé plus sobrement le 3734 !

La carte est simple dans le bon sens, les produits sont de bonnes qualités et viennent d'artisan et c'est ca qu'on veut sérieux. De la bouffe du terroir un peu sophistiqué pour satisfaire nos papilles ainsi que nos instincts primaires venant de la terre !
La guedille de homard était bonne, le pain superbe, les frites assaisonnés à la perfection avec la paprika. 
Le thé glacé maison est un vrai thé glacé maison, pas un truc avec 10 blocs de sucre. On sent le thé et on en redemande.
A priori les brunch sont du même acabit, de la qualité en veux tu en voila.
Que demande de plus ?
Va chercher bonheur au 3734 dans ce quartier en plein développement."}
{"text":"Récidive au 3734 et plus satisfaite encore. Cafe Americano  est bon et chaud la salade du jour et légumes grilles sont un délice."}
{"text":"Vraiment une nouvelle adresse complète; bonne bouffe portugaise, service souriant et professionel, proprios sympas.

Une belle découverte cette semaine pour nous.

Le poulet est un must! 
Belle carte des vins.

Ils servent des brunchs le week-end également.

On y retournera. :)

P.S. Petite épicerie juste à côté leur appartenant, le poulet à cuire chez vous est disponible :)"}
{"text":"Very tasty lunch! 
The place is very cute and the menu is highlighting a variety of original ingredients in an original way. They have a little shop right next to the restaurant that sells rustic products. Love!"}
{"text":"Awesome brunch, great portions, really good prices. We tried the grilled cheese, the casserole, and espressos, everything was really tasty. We're lucky to have many good brunch spots in St-Henri, and 3734 might be the best of them."}
{"text":"I wasn't flattered by the lunch menu of 3734, but I heard that they offer amazing brunch. The waitress told me that the restaurant specializes in Portuguese food, but I didn't really like it because it is really too different from the Portuguese food I tried in Portugal. Their portion is decent but overall their dishes are not wow."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Sunday morning. Me and my friend were basically the first ones there (we arrived 5 minutes before they opened). 

It was a snowy weekend so we were told they weren't expecting many people to come since it was snowing (apparently people in Montreal don't go out when it snows). 

I have to say, the service was excellent. The waitress was extremely friendly and very helpful. She accommodated my dietary restrictions and made sure there was no pork in my brunch. She came back to check on us various times like you would normally expect back in the States. 

The food itself was really good. The meat was delicious and the portion was just big enough to fill you without feeling nauseated. 

I would definitely recommend this place. The menu was big enough to satisfy different tastes and the price was excellent. 

Only reason why I'm not giving this place 5 stars is the intense smell of smoke/meat that stayed on my clothes and hair the whole day after coming here. They should maybe invest in a better filter system or whatever it is that restaurants to not have the patrons smell like a barbecue."}
{"text":"Ambiance casual, service aimable, propriétaires chaleureux, et bouffe impeccable! Mes recommandations: le potage de chou fleur, le steak avec sauce hollandaise et les desserts en général!! Leurs beignes maison sont sublimes."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch! Our experience in Montreal is that the food here is better than Paris. 3734 is a nice neighborhood restaurant. The grilled cheese and hamburger were fantastic! Everything is reasonable in price. The service is personable and friendly, just as you would expect from a neighborhood place. This is very close to the Atwater Marche, good place to linger for a simple lunch."}
