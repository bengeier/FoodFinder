{"text":"I had read a couple negative reviews before going for dinner last Tuesday night, so I was pleasantly surprised with my experience.  The menu is great - quite a bit of variety, and some interesting items. I had the \"All Canadian Burger\" with fries. The portion was huge. I actually had to cut the burger in half, as to not have it make a big mess - this is a good thing. Admittedly, it was a tad greasy, and was lacking a bit of flavour, I thought, but it was overall a decent burger.   The service was fine. We had a very friendly server, who checked up on us periodically, and continued to refill our water long after the meal - no pressure to leave. It wasn't very busy, so perhaps we had better service as a result, but either way my experience was good.  Beer wasn't as over-priced as I expected - $6 for a pint of Heineken.   I might check this place out again, to try some of the odder stuff on the menu. The only annoyance from the evening was that they didn't take Interac/Debit, but there was an ATM (with $2.50 fee) in the connected Thompson Hotel."}
{"text":"Terrible service and bad food. We asked about our drinks and water 15 mins after ordering and was told \"We are busy, you will have to wait\". The poutine has been sitting on the counter the cheese was solid and cold when it got to us. The grilled cheese hamburger was just a bad grilled cheese with a bad hamburger patty. We asked for onions rings and the server substituted it with fries without first informing us, claiming they are out of onion rings."}
{"text":"Pretty solid burgers for late night snacks,but also killer breakfast. Eggs benny is the way to go.  Lil' pricey but once you start eating you have zero f**** to give."}
{"text":"I like the Counter! Chic decor, friendly wait staff. The chunky pretzel sticks on the table was a nice touch. I ordered a burger here the first time I came. It stylishly arrived on a wooden cutting board, and was delicious. The fries were ok, but nothing to write home about. After taking a bite of my burger, I put it down on the cutting board, where it promptly rolled off the table and fell apart on the floor.  After laughing with my friend for half an hour, my heart broke a little. Because now I had no burger.  I told our waiter what had happened, and he was awesome. He offered to make me another one, on the house. I had already eaten half of the burger, so I declined. He offered me some soup, which I accepted. It was mushroom soup with two toasted pieces of bread. Pretty good!  I've been back here since, and am always way careful with my burger."}
{"text":"An extra shout-out to Christina for sorting out the confusion about the bill charges. It turned out to be more complicated than it seemed, and I appreciate her making sure it all worked out properly.  Great service, even after the fact !"}
{"text":"First off, the service was excellent. Waitresses were very pleasant hand helpful.  I decided to go with the 550 Club sandwich with a side of mac n cheese. Having seen the Cheese Boutique truck pull in for a delivery, I knew immediately they used only the top and best ingredients (no kraft cheese) for their menu.  I agree with Kelly, the portions are huge, I never doggy bag my meals, but this time I had no choice. The sandwich was made perfectly, with tender turkey meat and the lettuce and bread perfectly crunchy. The mac and cheese was served in a cast iron skillet with bread crumb sprinkled on the top. It was almost a meal in itself, so delicious. Comparable to Trevor Kitchen and Bar.  In this type of restaurant / diner, you get exactly what you pay for, and that is perfection. It is a hidden gem, and I will definitely be going back to try the grilled cheese."}
{"text":"Since there are already 65 reviews of this place, I don't feel like I have a tremendous amount more to contribute!  I only wanted to say that I think that $17.50 for an omelette and $17.00 for the donut burger - both on the brunch menu - is way overpriced.  After a late night, me and friend went to have brunch because it was one of the only places in walking distance.  I was happy with everything except the bill.  After tax and tip, $45.00 for brunch really soured my experience!!!"}
{"text":"Great onion rings and good traditional margaritas (not the American slurpee verison) http://omnomtaro.blogspot.ca/2013/05/review-thompson-diner.html"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night, was fairly quiet and service sucked.  Food was great, good milkshakes though the staff told us they had to figure out how to make them cause they weren't quite sure. Everyone I went with had burgers. Great but my friend's was missing alfalfa sprouts and mine the crispy onions that were listed on the menu description. Best onion rings I've had in my life were had here. Must try."}
{"text":"An interesting place to check out but the food is consistently disappointing, especially considering how pricey the menu is."}
{"text":"Gone twice. Bright n early (think party nights) order eggs benny. Served cold. Sauce was hardening. Asked to have it replaced/ heated up. They still didn't get it right. Breakfast is the easiest meal to make n considering we were a group of tipsy ppl we weren't picky. Honestly, id rather eat mcdonalds - at least u get what u pay for. Not a good experience, do not recommend. Go to Frans or else wear for break-y."}
{"text":"The food here is horrible and the service is not much better.  \"Best Mac N Cheese\" in town?  I don't think so.  That nasty pasta was watered down and required tons of ketchup to make it halfway edible.  The salad had definitely been in the FREEZER for far too long.  This was my second try at the Thompson.  I will not be giving it a third shot."}
{"text":"The Thompson Diner is a convenient option for a late night meal.  Traditional bar food but a bit on the expensive."}
{"text":"Double Mac & Cheese is the Bomb.com and our waiter Kevin was GREAT!! Must eat if ever in Toronto! We will be back to get the Chicken Fingers, thx for the sample Kevin..."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible everything since it has become The Thompson Diner.  Pretty sure the staff while it was under The Counter name is not there anymore.  My friend and I went to the diner around 2 pm for some late lunch.  The waitress was absolutely useless.  Took well over 20 mins to ask for our drink orders.  I had to ask 3 times for water.  3 more of our friends showed up and that was when the first friend and I finally ordered our food.  At this point, I had to ask her a FOURTH time for some water.  All she did was say \"Oh, okay.  Right back with the water.\"  As if this was the first time we had this request.  No apologies or \"Oh my God!  I totally forgot!\"  When the food (Me - Classic breaky, over easy, bacon; Friend - Mac & Cheese w truffle oil and pancetta.) finally came it was COLD.  They served the food on an iron skillet, which is supposed to retain the heat and when they come to the table, you should not be able to touch them.  I was able to white knuckle the hell out of the handles.  My eggs were terribly runny -- which is suspect because they went cold.  Bacon was floppy.  The Mac & Cheese was good ... would have been amazing if it was hot and came with the pancetta.  The rest of the group got burgers ... nothing too special from their end.  The diner was not busy at all so there was no excuse for the terrible service.  The waitress seemed clueless as she messed up the bills and had to have 2 other employees help her fix the issue at the computer station ... having us wait another 10 mins.  She dropped the bills off and (we knew to have our cards out and ready to pay right away) she scurried away.  My other friend, fed up, decided to just approach another waitress to process the payment.  The waitress, being busy just standing at the hostess table, refused to do anything about it.  Terrible terrible service.  And the food was just disgusting.  Considering the menu and resto vibe is the exact same as The Counter's, they must have put complete dumbasses in the kitchen and front of house."}
{"text":"For a 24 hour diner this place is ok. The service has never been good but I don't really think the servers really care about that either. One thing they never get wrong is the grilled cheese and Caesars."}
{"text":"Delicious! Has an old school diner feel but updated. Staff is exceptional, efficient and quick. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Attached to the swish new Thomson Hotel, \"The Counter\" is open 24 hours, a welcome addition to a neighborhood where the only previous late-night choice was McDonalds. While the food has been consistently good, the service has swung between excellent (on our first visit) and neglectful. Prices are a little high for the quality of food, but I guess you pay for the place being open 24 hours. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you are drunk and looking for a 24 place to go to then this is a great spot to get some greasy goodness in your system, the service there is horrible though, waited there for almost 1/2 an hour after I was finished until I even saw a waiter to ask him to get my bill.  Not good for a place that had 1 other table at 4am in the morning. They do also have a tendancy of mixing up your order as well. I ordered the double deck grilled cheese when they had it and a ceasar and they came out witha  single layer grilled cheese and a garden salad and the waiter said it was texas style toast so just as much bread as a grilled cheese. Sent it back after a minute or 2 or arguing.    I never do that because of years of working in kitchens, but seriously penny pinching that much because you ran out of the wrong cut of bread.  It was the difference between putting a smile on a customers face for just a few cents extra food or going the cheaper route and ending up wasting a full sandwich in the end anyways.    Great location, and a place like that is definitely needed, but they need to learn customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! The food is terrible and over priced. They charged me $3 bucks for a side of toast and when I asked for it to be buttered they refused (rude wanna be hipster). No self-respecting Torontonian would EVER put up with the crap in this place. It's a COMPLETE waste of time.  Thompson Diner, get your SHIT together! Or stop calling yourself a \"Diner\"."}
{"text":"I have such a weakness for diner food, but you know what?  I'm a great big snob about what I eat.  The Counter is the perfect solution: comfort food that's elegantly presented, perfectly cooked, and absolutely delicious.  The sandwiches are big and messy--I had my hands full with the shrimp po'boy.  (So good!)  And the sides!  They've got the usual fries, salad and onion rings, but they also offer wilted spinach or macaroni and cheese, which you can swap in for no additional cost.  It's a shame this place is so hidden away, because it deserves to be better known!"}
{"text":"Went there for late night breakfast.  I would not recommend going on a Friday or Saturday night if you drive because parking is approximately $20 if you are not lucky enough to find street parking.    The service was fabulous, however the food came out slowly.  There is definitely a premium on the food as I could have found better eats elsewhere and for a lower price.  Nonetheless, it wasn't unreasonably expensive, only if you add your parking cost to your bill.  The food was average, nothing spectacular, I probably would have had equal or better food at Franz.  Note that I did go around 11pm."}
{"text":"When i went to the Thompson diner i was impressed by all the different food selections. They had burgers, poutine, pancakes, nachos, wings and chicken fingers and many more. Me and my family ordered chicken fingers, the fat american tomato bisque soup, and a cheese burger with peameal bacon.   The chicken fingers were really delicious. They had a good portion and it came with delicious jalapeno cheddar sauce.  The burger was pretty bad. It was so dry and was hard to swallow. The cheese was barley melted and stuck to the bread and i could barley taste it. The peameal bacon was ok but was also very dry. It was so bad and i would rather eat a big mac.   The fat american was amazing,  It was an generous portion of pancakes with peameal bacon in between.  Finally the tomato bisque wasn't my favorite. The dill was too strong and there was really nothing standing out or exiting about it.  Overall the experience was ok but hopefully there are better diners in Toronto."}
{"text":"I've given the Counter & the Diner a try and I have to say both times I left disappointed.  The prices are above \"diner\" and the quality is sub par.  In fact, the last time I visited both myself and my dining partner received food poisoning.   Save your stomach & wallet and head elsewhere."}
{"text":"Horrible. It takes them 55min to make 4 sandwiches (a sad excuse for manager \"calls it\"  25 minutes and than offers you a free coffee). Food is mostly blend and tasteless. Grilled cheese they have as their \"image\" is absolutely horrendous. Management is incapable of managing the restaurant (they do not realize that you can not run an after midnight restaurant on a skeleton crew, especially on a weekend night) Fran's food is just as bad, but at least you get it in half the time."}
{"text":"Went for Saturday brunch.  Their $17.50 breakfast looks and tastes exactly like the $5.99 special anywhere else.  Right down to the brown Wonder Bread.  There's waaayyy better dining experiences out there folks."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover. This is true for the Thompson Diner. The cover looks great but the book is no good.  Part of our order never showed up, the order that finally showed up was wrong, we never received a refill on our coffee and my seat at the bar was right beside a massive pile of dirty cups which were not taken care of during the entire duration of my visit.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews I agree a lot with their quality service.  I went to the Counter when it first opened and I thought it was a huge rip of for what they charge.  But, they have gotten better in the past year since opening, but nothing spectacular.  I have heard that some of their dishes are hit and miss.  I think their menu is slightly over priced for most of their items.  But, I can recommend to try the Deep South Burger, its pretty damned good, with fried pork strips on it.  It is expensive but one of the cheaper main course meals on their menu I believe.  If my best friend didn't live in the condo above, I probably wouldn't end up at this place, but convenience trumps in the winter."}
{"text":"Best Mac & Cheese in Toronto! Perfect for that post-bar hunger."}
{"text":"Went here Saturday night with a few friends. Everyone was very pleased with their food + fast service. I ordered the Mac and Cheese with goat cheese and bacon - delicious! The portions are a good size (had enough to take home for the next day!)   It gets rowdy after 3am with people looking for a bite after the bars/clubs but it was entertaining . Plus you may have to wait in a line outside if all the tables are taken.   Overall good comfort food ;)"}
{"text":"I originally went there back in 2012 and the food was awesome.  I had the steak and shoe string fries, my friend had the fish & chip and it was so light and delicious.  I just went back 2 weeks ago and I get that menus change but was surprised by the changes.  Now the items are just regular items that can be found any other burger joint, the food wasn't fantastic it was just ok. Really disappointed they no longer have the fish & chips.  I won't go back due to the high prices for regular type burgers.  Too bad I thought I found another go to place."}
{"text":"Have been 3 times now. First experience was great, good food, good service.   Second time, good food, terrible service.  server immediately came to our table mistook me for a previous patron hed had a problem with a month prior, i corrected him and said it could not have been me, he insisted it was, very rude. Came back to our table a second time, a friend asked him what happened between him and the other person, again the server insisted it was me. I asked \"if he was stupid or what?\" Since he couldnt seem to comprehend hed made a mistake and was agitating me. Anyway told him to stay away from our table the rest of the night, at least he listened to that. Dont make it so clear you think all black people look the same, asshole. The host on for the night saved our dining experience, did a better job than the server.  Third time, great food, terrible service.  Took over 20 mins for our order to be taken. The drunken table beside us got their food, argued abt their food, had it sent back, remade and brought to their table all before we even had our order taken. My food was good (alpine burger with side order mac n cheese, vanilla milkshake), my partner complained of burned chicken fingers, less than stellar fries and orange juice that tasted as if theyd added grapefruit juice to it. Food came in good time. After we were clearly finished the server took another 20 mins to pay attention to us asking for the bill. We yelled \"Yo\" 'cos nothing else would get his attention and he got offended haha. Then shoved my change at me insisting his bad service... not cool. Quietly take your tip, apologize and do better next time.  The night staff clearly arent people persons :/   If you live close or are in the area and youre hungry before going home from drinking its not worth the wait outside in line for this. Cab somewhere else..."}
{"text":"I have only eaten here once, it was a lunch with my work colleagues since it is located quite close to my office.   Decor had some cool retro vintagey looking bits but then was mixed with some cheesy 80's lounge patterns, it didn't feel unified. But I don't really care about decor, I care about mah belly.   The food was good. A tad on the pricey side for \"diner\" food, but hey the boss was paying. It didn't blow my mind however, nor was it titillating enough to entice me to return. Very limited options for vegetarians. My meat-eating coworkers enjoyed their orders but weren't mind-blasted by the food either.  And the dishes were these awkward board-like thingys that made for tonnes of sloppy spilling and made eating awkwardly difficult, especially in front of bossman.  The service, was lacking... and slow. And I'm no high-maintenance facestuffer. They weren't even busy. Granted, this was when they had just opened so perhaps, to give them the benefit of the doubt, they were still working out the kinks.   But then a server dropped mustard and ketchup all over my pants and shoes. No big deal, I reassured them it was ok and asked for a cloth... and then waited. and waited. Finally 15 minutes later I got up and asked for a cloth again. She said \"oh you didn't go to the bathroom?\" Um no, I asked for a cloth doofus.   No apology, no discount on the bill, no complimentary anything. Wasn't impressed.  I'd recommend Sneaky Dee's over this place. For reals.  I don't really often write negative reviews... so maybe you'll have better luck?"}
{"text":"Love going to the Diner for brunch.  My attitude at Sunday brunch is that I'm there to relax. Last Sunday they were the busiest I've ever seen them. Food took quite a while but server was courteous and kept refilling coffee, water etc. Once we got our food, it was great and still piping hot. Staff seems to have fun when they're working."}
{"text":"I went to the Counter (since renamed the Thompson Diner) not too long ago and was frankly underwhelmed.  Where to start?   My fried chicken was decent but the beyond the decently crispy batter I felt that the chicken lacked flavour, which is a problem I would chalk up to inadequate (or non-existant) brining. The chicken was served with a buttermilk dip (which was decent), but no hot sauce (noting that it took a couple of asks to get a bottle of Tabasco). The cheddar mashed potatoes were flavourful if a little overworked.   My wife's Nicoise salad was solid but salad is arguably a table stakes kind of thing and I'm reluctant to get too excited about it.  About the best thing about this place is the aesthetic which I would call darkly modern and vaguely Asian. The waiters look super hip too with their short sleeve button-ups and funky bow-ties but unfortunately their too cool for school personas seemed to seep into their general service levels, which were indifferent at best despite the fact that there were about as many staff members as patrons in the restaurant.   In conclusion, this is probably a 2.5. I might go back if I was in the area and needed a late night meal, but other than that I was expecting a little more from the place given that it comes attached to the Thompson name."}
{"text":"A lot of hype went around for this place as it was the first restaurant attached to The Thompson Hotel. I honestly give them a lot of credit for the concept, you know higher end diner food accompanied higher prices. I admit they do a great job dressing up the food but in all honesty I prefer the cheap greasy diners in and around the city (albeit none open 24 hrs). Although food is dressed up nicely, the taste of it don't compliment the looks. We ordered the Cobb Salad and the Mac n Cheese. The Cobb Salad was nothing more than a wedge of lettuce with dressing on top. Having lived in the US we were use to the toppings accompany the salad and it being a meal in itself. The Mac n Cheese look pretty with two flat bread sticking up and making a triangle but after first bite the bread was stale. The Mac n Cheese was alright but nothing spectacular.   If you are in the area and desperate for a meal in wee hours of the early morning then you got no choice otherwise you're better off elsewhere."}
{"text":"hahhahhahhahah...you are stupid if you eat here.. dry tasteless hamburgers.. greasy omelets, mashed potatoes that have the texture of cream soup shall I continue.. no methinks not..if you are hungry and stoned late at night ... good choice ..otherwise stay away"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this 2 stars because it's not the chef's fault that our waitress was the worst server I've ever had (no exaggeration). I could understand if the restaurant is busy (which it wasn't) or even if person is just a bad server, but still has a good attitude. Our server was not only terrible at her job, but she was also the rudest server I've ever had. I've never received such attitude and neglect from a server before.  Aside from having to wait for 20 minutes to simply as for tea, here are some quotes from our experience.  \"Everyone's fine here!\" - She said as she sped past our table. All of us were still waiting to order our drinks and I was trying to get her attention.  \"Ya, k. One sec!\"  - Trying to get her attention  10 minutes later   \"Ya. I got it. You want tea. One sec!\".  - Still hasn't taken the drink order   5 minutes later  \"Whatever. Ya, ok\".  - After she gets the drink order wrong because she kept interrupting us  \"Is there a problem here!?\" - After we had to ask another waiter if we could pay...we'd been waiting for 15 min  I could rant on for days, but I'd hate for anyone else to suffer through her. I'll just cut to the ending.  I had a ton of leftovers, but I was too exhausted to ask her for a takeout container ... for the third time. I just wanted to get out of there. I left the food behind to avoid any more exasperated sighs or eye rolls."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and haven't been disappointed either time.   The first time I went, I ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken with Cheddar Mash and it was delicious. The chicken wasn't overly greasy and the mash was creamy--just the way I like them. The service was fine, nothing to complain about. I couldn't finish the meal, so I brought the leftovers to my boyfriend, who proclaimed it \"might be the best fried chicken I've had in this city.\"   The second time, I tried the fish and chips. The tartar sauce provided with the fish wasn't great, lacking in a certain zesty je-ne-sais-quoi, but the fish itself was quite nice: light, fluffy, and nicely cooked.   It's a bit pricey, but the atmosphere is lovely and personally I'd much rather sit in a nicely-lit, friendly atmosphere than your usual dingy old diner."}
{"text":"Went to The Counter for a late dinner on a Saturday night.  Service was good, the restaurant wasn't that busy for a weekend night.  I ordered a berry mojito and the Pastrami Reuben sandwich with fries and it was a pretty big portion and the mojito was quite large too.  The menu is quite large, and I think there is something for everyone.  I will def come back to eat here again...and its great that it is open 24 hours."}
{"text":"It was alright. The food was nothing outrageous. We came here late one night and were just glad that they seated us and fed us. For the price, I would have rather went to a McDonald's though."}
{"text":"Went back again for burgers with a group of friends.  We were not disappointed....great burgers, nice presentation on the plate, and huge portions again!  No shellac smell this time so it was even better than the first time."}
{"text":"So I guess it would be unfitting to have 24 hour greasy spoon like say, the Vesta, open among your ultra-hip, chic and modern condo buildings.  Instead you get an upscale diner in a 5 star hotel that attempts to recreate a greasy spoon without sticky tables, scuzzy plates or badly worn forks and knives.  When you review the wine, beer and $12 cocktail options you realize this is a diner-style diner.  And that's fine, but can your food and service keep up?  Diner service is no frills and fast - here forgetful and slow.  Diner food is simple but amazingly tasty using few ingredients and spices.  Here they seem to use plenty of ingredients but flavours are lacking.  Fried chicken had a batter that was 3 times as thick as any I've ever eaten but it was low on taste.  If you're going to use that much batter why wouldn't you season it with pepper or maybe salt.  Chicken fingers had more flavour and were a better option.  Burgers looked good but between the huge buns is a simple patty that can be dressed with higher end items.  I was told it tasted like any other burger except it was $12 or $13 which kind of throws off the taste.  Anyway, seems like a fine place for the upscale bar crowd that just came from nearby King West establishments, is wearing designer jeans and happily paid $8 or $9 for pints - visiting a true greasy spoon would kill the mood."}
{"text":"Love this place as a go to for any meal :) Always open, food is always fresh and so delicious. The only reason it is missing a star is because the serves can be a little cold and tend not to check in often enough. Otherwise this is our go to brunch joint! Try the brunch burger - the donuts it is on will not disappoint :)"}
{"text":"Meh, hardly a diner. Over priced trying to be made home made but end up with a non diner trendy place for people that need to things in jam jars and pay fine China prices. Was there for breakfast and it was fine."}
{"text":"nothing special about this place. Got the burger and girlfriend got the mac&cheese. nothing special at all. Mac & cheese was bland. Service was good though.   Wont be back. Too many better places to choose from in the area."}
{"text":"I discovered this as I was heading down to a hot yoga class (Moksha Yoga Downtown) on Friday night.  From the outside, it seems like a modern looking restaurant with your typical downtown crowd (stylish, urban, potentially snooty).  What made me initially question whether it was in fact a restaurant or not was a 24 Hour sign posted on the side.  it is a rare sight to see a restaurant with a modern looking interior that acts as a 24 hr diner.  24 hour diners typically resemble that of Fran's Diner, Markham Station, and the list goes on and on.  I'm in no way disrespecting these diners as I have frequented them on many occasions and appreciate the 24 hour accessibility.   So in this review, some things to keep in mind is that I am judging it based on it's restaurant typology (24 hour service venues) and the other general characteristics of a restaurant.  Decor: Firstly, in comparison to other 24 hr diners out there, this \"Trumps\" the rest in terms of cleanliness and \"modern-ness\".  It reminds me of the old buildings back when the floors had patterned mosaics and tiled walls.  I personally love it when a restaurant presents itself as an old meets new style.  I personally think that it's a welcome breath of fresh air to find a 24 hr diner that is clean.  Don't get me wrong, I'm no snob and would enjoy a late night meal at Fran's any night but from time to time I'd like to mix it up.  Food/Bar: Alongside with the decor, the food is also a bit more elaborate and not too expensive.  I would definitely recommend the Turkey Burger.  In my mind, it was one of the most tender burgers I've ever had!  Accompanied with that was their gourmet Mac and Cheese which seems to be an ongoing menu addition to most hip joints. This Mac and Cheese definitely did not disappoint with it's cured pancetta crisp and truffle oil. They have a bar counter there so people can come after lunch for a drink.  **Best [I've ever had] ONION RINGS segway**  OH MY, these Onion rings are spectacular.  It seems like they batter it with the same stuff they use for the Butter Fried Chicken or something but definitely out of this world.  They're a good size and are crispy and crumbly enough to give you a constant crunch in every bite!  They only gave me 3-4 pieces with my burger which totally bummed me out.  Next time, I'm ordering an entire side that comes in a bucket.    **Best [I've ever had] ONION RINGS end**   Service: The service was kind and attentive.  If it wasn't for our waitress, I would have never ordered the turkey burger.  I know it's important that service remains unbiased with their opinion on foods because everyone's taste is different but I value it...that's why we're all on yelp after all.  Location: As someone who has worked in this area before, this place appeals to another niche market of consumers who have been somewhat denied until now.  The bars and restaurants in this vicinity are either uber casual or uber pricey.  This is a good median.  So overall, for the sole reason that it this is one of the few restaurants that are open 24 hrs, nice decor inside, and the food can be greasy enough to satisfy those late night snackers, I give this a perfect score."}
{"text":"Nice place for brunch, just a few steps from our apartment.  The eggs benedict were great.  Also the bagels with cream cheese, plus the lovely jams."}
{"text":"This is one good diner open 24 hours really good food really good service The staff is really good and kind of laid-back I used to live in Toronto until a few months ago and I miss Thompson's!!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Thompson Diner for breakfast, for a lunch sandwich and now twice for dinner. Their service is certainly \"Hit or Miss\". When attending last week at around 8 pm with another person in my party the service was good. But when attending this evening the service was terrible because I was dining alone. When I came in many tables were free but the waiter wanted to seat me near the door in the middle of the aisle. I pointed out a booth instead. After I ordered my meal nobody checked how my meal was and when I asked for the cheque it was practically thrown at my table from a distance. I left a good tip regardless, but I will never return to the Thompson Diner again.  Regarding the food: veggie burger hockey puck size mushroom-small, not what I expected. The bun was stale, the onion rings, four only, however, were amazingly good and not greasy."}
{"text":"Worst food ever. The waiters and hostess were nice. The food? Not so much. Me and my significant other came in for a late dinner and as being here before we knew what we liked and what to expect. I ordered the \"famous\" fried chicken sandwich. I wouldn't call it famous as the taste was ridiculously awful. The chicken tasted like it had been sitting for awhile. So I politely asked for a substitute, which was generously replaced. From here I ordered a classic poutine. Thought I couldn't go wrong there...nope. No taste to the gravy and the fries tasted like they were old. Probably not going back there ever again. Don't waste your time or your money."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I had been wanting to try this place forever as we always drive by it. I guess we had high expectations since we had been putting off going here for so long and unfortunately it didn't live up to our expectations. I had a roasted turkey sandwich which was actually really good but other than that the meal was pretty average. My girlfriend had the goat cheese and beet salad and it wasn't great. Probably won't go back for dinner but their breakfast selection looked pretty awesome so we might have to go back for that."}
{"text":"For a 24 hour place, the food is soooo good. Buttermilk fried chicken...yum."}
{"text":"Nice room with cool floor and furnishings.  Acoustics pretty good, so not too much ambient noise.  Ordered the all day breakfast and got: 3 undercooked eggs, undercooked hash browns,  hard and lousy sausages for $12.50.  Complete rip off.  If you are going to charge \"premium\" for bacon and eggs, at least pretend to give something for that.  Service was good, which salvaged the bad food."}
{"text":"I haven't dined here in quite some time (since it was called The Counter), but ate here recently on a late Saturday night and was surprised there was a roped lineup to get in.   Is this a restaurant or a nightclub?   Waited about 10-15 minutes so it wasn't too bad and luckily it wasn't too cold outside.  I knew the food was quite decent and they have good burgers, BLTs and make a tasty poutine, therefore we didn't mind the wait. If the wait time was any longer, we probably would have gone elsewhere.    Prices are fairly reasonable and decor modern with a very casual ambience. Although just a little loud because it was the late night crowd.   Service was a little slow because it was extremely busy, but server was efficient once they appeared even though they didn't check on us once we got our food.  I ordered the BLT which had a good amount of bacon that was cooked to a nice crisp with fresh lettuce and tomatoes. The BLT was served on ciabatta bread and came with a side order of fries which were fresh, crispy, and lightly salted.    My friends both had the fried chicken which they said was good, so I'll take their words for it as I'm not a big fan of fried chicken, but will try it next time since that seems to be another favourite of the diner.  Overall it was a good experience,  but I will probably avoid going when the late night crowd is out, unless you don't mind the loud chattering and drunk people around you.  A bonus of Thompson Diner it's open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Came here last night. Food was pretty good but service was BAD. My friend and I were the only customers when we came in and it took the server more than 10 minutes to give us water and take our order. Extremely slow and not efficient. I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre.  The food isn't that good especially at the prices they're going for and the service is slow and terrible.   I've tried a few of their dishes: Their breakfast is horrendous even early in the morning. Their deep fried buttermilk chicken is very good (best item on the menu) Everything else I've had is rather mundane and forgettable.  I really hate the service.  Some really douchie hipster type assholes and inattentive overall.  I only keep going back because it's 24 hrs."}
{"text":"It's been two weeks since I had breakfast at The Counter and I am still thinking about the blueberry pancakes.  They were light and fluffy and just phenomenal.  They were so filling.  I tried my hardest to finish them but the delicious delights beat me.  In fact, my husband is making eggs for breakfast as I type this review and all I want are pancakes.  But fear of being disappointed by our homemade version means I'm eatin' eggs.  My husband had a goat cheese, spinach and asparagus omelette.  He thought it was good, tasted fresh and the bread was excellent.  My father-in-law had a meaty breakfast which he also enjoyed.  I mean, eggs, potatoes and bacon - if you muck that up, you're in the wrong business.    A word about our waitress - she was lovely.  Friendly, attentive and my husband liked her tattoos!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great service, amazing food, and good prices. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a simple casual place to grab lunch, dinner, or a late night bite. While there is nothing unique about the items offered on the menu, they certainly know how to make traditional foods right. I had the chicken fingers with fries and they are simply put, the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"The food is good - my omelet was excellent, but since I was there for breakfast, the coffee is important. And the coffee is terrible. It wasn't just a bad day; this is my second visit in a week and the coffee is consistently bad. They've either let their beans rot, or they don't clean the machine, or they're getting the cheapest robusta beans - I'm not sure why, but the coffee has a very bad taste. Avoid it if you can."}
{"text":"Apparently the Turkey Burger is good, I wouldn't know though as they brought me a chicken breast on a bun when I ordered it...."}
{"text":"Great comfort food. I ordered the grilled cheese burger, which was absolutely delicious. It was a lot of food though, so being your appetite!   Classic diner environment, nothing fancy but it is a refreshing change from other restaurants in that area.   It is open 24 hours, so come for dinner or a late night snack!"}
{"text":"After the STP concert last night, we were hungry and too lazy to go home and cook something for ourselves. So instead I checked on yelp for 24 hr diners in the area, as we didn't have the car with us and wanted something close enough to walk to.   It was rather empty when we arrived, with maybe another 3 tables occupied. Our server greeted us with a smile and took our drink orders right away. Everything in the menu is your basic diner food, but at reasonably higher prices than most other diners. Then again, The Counter does not look like your regular greasy diner, instead, it is sleek and modern, and attached to the very trendy Thompson Hotel.   I got the three cheese melt (grilled cheese sandwich) $9.00, with poutine as my side. My bf got the Reuben $12.00 and mac and cheese as his side. The three cheese melt was delicious! So cheesy and impossibly gooey. The cheese oozed out of it with every bite I took. The poutine was a disappointment. It needed much more gravy than it had, and the fries were clearly the frozen variety. It was dry and hard to eat and they totally cheaped out on the cheese curds. My bf's Reuben was yummy. Piled high with meat, sauerkraut. The mac and cheese was creamy, cheesy and had a nice crispy golden layer at the top. It was so much better than my mediocre poutine, that I ate half of it and made my bf eat my poutine instead :)   Our bill came to $29.00 ( we didn't get any booze), very reasonable for the ammount of food we got. The service was fast, and our waitress was pleasant, not very engaging but she always had a smile on her face, which I appreciated.   I'll definitely come back next time I'm the area and looking for a bite late at night."}
{"text":"The new menu is Ass, chicken fingers look like shit I can buy at Nofrills.. Super disappointed cuz I use to like the food, I guess new management is a cheap fuck..."}
{"text":"Overpriced, Fried chicken is horrible Popeyes is better! However the nachos are good ! Service is quite alow even though we went during midweek and it was not very busy. Thanks but wont be back"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place and last night...we decided.. why not?  It's great to know another place (besides 7west) that's open 24/7.   The decor is very nice for an all nighter sort of place. Forgive me, I have only Mississauga's Denny's to compare it to. :p  Suffice to say, this place is fun after a happy drunken night. I met up with a few friends and was pleased to see it was big group friendly.  I adore the uniforms. Bowties - WOOOT WOOT. THEY HAVE MY VOTE ANYDAY!!!  I uploaded the only 3 pictures (I wasn't capable of anything beyond eating ).   The bathrooms are nice, drunken friendly. The crowd is so so. Our server was the loveliest flamboyant boy ever!.  He was just so lovely!. So courteous and catering to our needs.  ^_^  order:  Med. Dip. - yumm. The bread was a bit so so but the hummus was very garlicy. This is a good sharing app. Crab cakes - a bit over done? - I can't be sure. I had a bit and wasn't feeling it.  Fries & onion rings - SOOOO delicious. Mostly the onion rings. The fries helped me pace the deliciousness of the onion rings. Like a savoury bomb attack every consecutive 3 minutes.  Santa Fe Salad w chkn - this was delicious. Unexpectedly delicious. The avocado was cut so neatly.. i had to take a picture of it. It was fresh, light and really tasty. I highly recommend this for a lunch or light dinner option.   Chkn fingers - can't go wrong. The mayo dip was BOMB! I also used it for the onion rings. Which turned from a regular 32cc bomb into an atomic type of bomb. (I have no idea why I'm using bombs as my metaphors today)  classic poutine - the cheese was weird. It tasted different. Not a fan. There really was no \"classic\" here. Blaah.   Long hot dog - when your craving street meat but your friends wont let you. Delicious. Think carnival fair type of hot dog.    It was a delicious late dinner. tendered to my every craving. Sweet, salty, greasy, fatty, salad-y and fresh.   I cannot say anything bad about this place. Albeit, my taste buds were a bit biased within these hours.   All in all, good to know another 24/7 with a good menu selection for every taste bud. I will def be coming back.   xoxo M."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times already at different times during the day/night.   I must say the huge sign out front that says 24/7 is alluring, especially when its 4am and youre starving.  The food and service is nothing special. In fact I would even say that its underwhelming. The menu is bland, the items are generic, and the presentation/decor is dated.  The first time, I ordered a veggie burger and it was just wrong. Not only was the bread stale but the patty dry as well. The toppings included were really funky (bean sprouts, bell peppers, egg plant, zucchini) and just not made well. The second time I ordered a chicken Caesar salad and it was basically lettuce with a tub of dressing and an overcooked and dry (non-sliced) chicken breast sitting in the middle (again, presentation: awful). The third time, the quesadillas were greasy and made me feel nautious (couldn't even finish the entire meal this time).  The wait times are not proportionate to the amount of customers in the restaurant (its as if the chefs prepare the orders arbitrarily and not in sequence). And the servers always seems to rush to ask me how the food is like right after they bring it to my table, its as if they already know the answer and want to get the pleasantries out of the way asap.  Plus, the servers never really look happy or smile. It genuinely Makes me feel miserable when I'm there.  Definitely wont be visiting again. And recommend you don't either.  Overpriced, overiced and overrated."}
{"text":"Been here for breakfast a few times now. Love that the place is always fast, food is simple but really well done, and is a mix of traditional diner/all day breakfast stuff with a modern funky twist. Service is great. As a shift worker, being able to find a bite to eat at all hours is always a plus! Will definitely be taking friends to visit"}
{"text":"It was a bit of a wait - 40 minutes or so - to get seated but that's our fault for deciding to do brunch in King St West area on a Sunday at 11:30 am. My back was starting to hurt from standing so long (no seating available) and right when we were about to give up and leave we got seated. Our waiter was very charming and engaging and thankfully, unlike the wait time, the kitchen got our orders out to our tables in reasonable time. I had the basic eggs and bacon with a side of turkey. It was simple but well done fare. I would have preferred steak and eggs but red meat was not on the brunch menu which is too bad. One friend ordered the chicken waffle and it looked delicious. If it came with a side of egg it would have been perfect. The ambiance was great, the company awesome, the coffee was endless and the food pretty good for diner food. I do recommend that you either arrive earlier like 10 or 10:30 am or later like anytime after 1 pm., in order to avoid the excruciating wait time. I also would love it if a steak and egg option was added to the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers. Friendly service. Place is really nice and comfy. Ketchup available at your table  Not that comon in Canada."}
{"text":"A few friends and I headed down after a night on Saturday.  We got there around 2:45am and the place was packed.  We waited in line for a good 15 minutes till we were seated.  My friend and I shared a strawberry milkshake and mini poutine.  The milkshake was pretty good, good balance of ice cream to milk.  The poutine was sub-par, and really mini.  We paid $11 for our meal.   Another friend ordered their burger with onion rings, he said he has made better burgers elsewhere. His burger was $15.  The atomsphere is quite interesting, it is like a dressed up diner.    Value for food, you can get better late night eats elsewhere to more moderate pricing."}
{"text":"This hotel attachment seriously lacks in the flavour department, which is a letdown for the kind service and elegant décor. My friend and I came at midnight on a Saturday to mend our empty stomachs, ordering Hot Chicken Wings, Inferno Burger, and Double Mac & Cheese with Truffle Oil.   Hot Chicken Wings: Slightly heavy on the vinegar and not spicy enough; they came with a watery blue cheese dipping sauce and a \"ration\" of only three carrot sticks - c'mon now!  Inferno Burger: Quite average in taste with the overall composition falling apart.   Mac & Cheese: I find it difficult to understand how this would be one of their \"signature\" dishes, because it was sent back after a couple of bites. Simply put, there was not nearly enough cheese nor was the sauce even tasty - strangely yucky!"}
{"text":"This diner is legendary for late night dining for good reasons.   Fried chicken and jalapeño waffles. Aw yeah!  Crispy, juicy, chicken available 24 hours a day!   The Peking duck poutine with hoisin gravy was freaking delicious.   -It's like two of my favorite foods frankensteined into a beautiful Asian-French-Canadian cheesefry bowl.   Love this place!! :D"}
{"text":"I've come here once or twice really late at night and the best thing is probably that it's open. I've had burgers both times and the meat was always really dry. I feel like I should give it a shot at a reasonable hour to see if it's any better but my general sentiment has been \"well, it's food.\""}
{"text":"Went here again last Friday with my friend, had a drink and some great apps. Spinach dip was good, onion rings were okay. I had the montreal smoked meat sandwich, a bit too salty for my taste. but i still liked it. i'd go back."}
{"text":"Updated review:  Recently visited and must say a big improvement from the last time.  Food is a lot better.  A decent choice for late night eats."}
{"text":"Came here after a night out with some friends. We left the place completely satisfied and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a quick bite to eat. Everything was quick, service was great, and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Painfully overpriced breakfasts. Just because you serve your 2 eggs, bacon and home fries in a cast iron skillet with a wooden board underneath it does not mean you charge nearly 10 dollars more than a place that simply plates it.  The servers are irritating, and they don't accept debit. However, they will happily point you to the in house ATM that charges 2 dollars for withdrawal.   Don't bother. If you're in the area, just go to UFO."}
{"text":"Worst Mac and cheese ever, don't know why it made BlogTO list, my friend as well as my boyfriend both agreed it was bland and honestly horrible.   Do not order this if you go there.  Save yourself!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast joints in the city.   I had the El Beneticto with home fries/potatoes. It was unbelievable, and the potatoes are some of the best I've had.  Considering the restaurant was full, the food came to our table in a timely manner and the service was excellent.   Our server Trish and another young lady were super friendly and accommodating.  I would highly recommend this place and look forward to returning.  Oh, and the milkshakes....amazing!  I'm now heading for the treadmill."}
{"text":"This diner is awesome! I am a bit disappointed by their lack of vegetarian/vegan options, but that makes sense with the theme.  As a vegetarian, I enjoy their Three Cheese Melt (Grilled Cheese). They do not offer it in the AM, and a few times I went early in the day and could not find any acceptable meals, and no exception would be made to making this (Even though the restaurant was not busy). A grilled cheese sandwich is totally an acceptable breakfast option!  Otherwise, I have been satisfied. The beer selection works great for late nights, and the convenience of being open 24 hours (+online delivery options) can't be beat."}
{"text":"After a few late nights (*cough* early mornings *cough*) and lunch-hours at The Counter I can offer a fairly reliable approval of the establishment.  Diner food, done right, with a gourmet flare.   Grilled cheese?  Yes, but with 3 cheeses.  Mac & cheese? Yes, but with crispy bacon and garlic cheese cause.  Hot dog? Yes, but 12\" long.  Breakfast sammy? Yes, but with peameal, kaiser, swiss and egg.  You get where I am going here - The Counter offers the staple of the diner menu but with a more refined environment and approach to the recipe.    Oh, another great thing - it's open 23h per day (with breakfast served at all times)."}
{"text":"Wow was a great establishment! I really enjoyed my vegetarian meals with my friend eating the veggie burger and grilled cheese! The grilled cheese was decadent and the service was great. Thank you for the wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"I was told this place had the best mac & cheese in the city so I was very excited to come here for the first time. I was massively let down. Might have been the hype but I just didn't think the dish lived up to what everyone had been telling me.  I went there last night again and was once again disappointed. I asked for the poutine not even realizing that there was two options Classic Poutine $5.25 or Poutine Quebecoise $8.25 (I am looking at the menu again now) and I don't my bill. Anyhow, our waiter who said he was from Montreal ASSURED me that I would love it. I didn't, I barely touched it, it was pretty bad, in fact. I am also disappointed that he didn't bother to ask me which of the 2 poutines I wanted and must have just chosen for me - in my books that's BAD SERVICE.  I am so very disappointed by this place which is in the base of a very swanky hotel I don't ever want to go there again. HOWEVER, my friend got the Fat American: Sausage  & Bacon stuffed pancakes, topped with crispy battered onions & Fried Egg and while I find the name mildly offensive being an American (and not fat) it was very tasty (he couldn't finish it). The price on it was STEEP though - $15!  What I learned from this place: Just because it's high priced in a high priced location doesn't mean the food & service will actually be any good."}
{"text":"Ordered via ubereats  First order came quickly but was the wrong order. Had to phone uber for a refund and we re ordered. The second time we ordered the food took forever to arrive and it arrived cold  Food was awful. Chicken wings were soggy, the burger was severely Overcooked like a hockey puck and the Mac and cheese was bland. Highly disappointed will not order again"}
{"text":"Popped in on a Tuesday mid-morning and as previous reviewers say, service was great - were seated and had coffees almost immediately (noted it was a Tuesday so the place was empty).   Unfortunately the food was TERRIBLE, the good service couldn't save this review. The \"best chicken burger in Toronto\" batter had zero seasoning or flavor at all. WHO voted for this. V curious."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say the food lives up to the wait. The wait was long I was SO hungry when it finally came an hour after ordering. We only got two small things. The eggs Benedict was OK the bread was dry and stale tasting which I didn't mind because I don't eat bread. The hollandaise was eh. The egg was poached longer than necessary. The smoked salmon was a bit fishy. The home fries were good but like kind of old not freshly fried. Kind of weird to have a diner like this attached to the swanky and upscale Thompson. My husband liked his omelette but he likes everything and it looked average to me. The filling inside seemed a bit under seasoned. Def wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"Came here today for brunch and really enjoyed it. The service here was one of the best I've seen. Had the prosciutto croissant eggs benny and it was decent.  In terms of food quality, it was pretty standard; I've had better eggs benny before. Nevertheless, this place is decent. And the service is incredible! You don't have to ask for a slice of birthday cake, or ask for a better glass of orange juice. They listen to you and serve you without you having to ask. Totally appreciated that."}
{"text":"The most dry burger on king street. Everything else is good. The burgers suck. Make sure to have a cup of water next to you if you decide to eat one or you might choke."}
{"text":"me want food-dinner....eat, in my mouth.....chicken....Barbara Streisand ....blagghghhhhhhhhhhhhh *hiccup*  *hiccup*  This is how an intoxicated version of myself lets his friends know, \"Hey, I believe that I've had a little too much to drink this evening, and in order to avoid vomiting, I shall require sustenance immediately *hiccup* *hiccup*\"  Following my incoherent ramblings (which only a select few can make sense of), I was tossed into a cab from one Night club and arrived moments later at what appeared to be ANOTHER night club (at least to my drunken shifty eyes). Neon signage, suited bouncer at the door, long line up, people greasing bounders to get in... inside wasn't much different, lounge-y, dimly lit, progressive house playing in the background (or in my head... either way). Apparently this is a diner?  We were seated swiftly, although I can't recall how we avoided the line up and were presented with the menu. I couldn't read so I inaudibly requested what my server recommended (which came out as \"me, eat...help.... reco! RECOOO!!!!!\") She'd likely seen my type before and suggested their Fried Chicken with a side of mac'n'cheese. OH MY-LANTA!!!! You glorious woman you!!!!  As I'm told by my friends, at the mere mention of Fried Chicken I responded \"YES.. THAT\" and attempted to point at my server with my menu...which also failed as the menu was nearly thrown at her... sigh... Kris, you're better than this old boy, you're better than this.  Time passed quickly and when the stainless steel cup filled with 5 pieces of fried chicken armed with a baked side of mac'n'cheese, arrived I made little conversation, and quick work of the meal. My suit jacket is ruined I'm sure, covered in cheese, grease, and hot sauce. I have no regrets...  From what I recall the meal was unbelievable, and sobered me up/put me out right away. I passed out on the table the minute I was finished (thanks to my friends for moving my plate out of the way). Not ashamed.   For gourmet-gastro style after bar food and excellent handling of drunk waste cases like myself, I award the Thompson Diner:  bbiG...ponts...with a star.... la la la... extra good... LINDSAY LOHAN..... (5 stars)  Eat *hiccup* crest.. Out"}
{"text":"We used to be regular customers in the past 3 years but service and food has gone downhill BUT price has increased at least twice or 3 times in the last 6 months.  Very disappointed and we will remove this place from our favourite brunch place..."}
{"text":"This place gets 2 stars... 1 for the food, 1 for the location in the gorgeous hotel.  I cant believe what a beautiful job this did on the inside and outside of this building, bravo!  I ordered a burger and a milkshake and it took about 25 minutes to bring me the burger, which was delish! So Im waiting and waiting and the milkshake never arrives, so I ask for the bill and the waitress had the nerve to charge me for the milkshake and not even bring it to me, and when I asked about the milkshake the other serves had no idea I ordered one. If I was the manager, I would have him take this seriously with her. The waitress wasen't pretentious, but I felt that she did it on purpose 100%.  On a side note, they have these digusting rock hard bread pretzel stick thingys, they were so bad I didnt know if they were edible."}
{"text":"i have come here so many times with friends who insist on hanging out here. i would never return of my own accord. overpriced. dry and unseasoned food. on several occasions ive heard the staff saying some off the walls shit that i would think people are too embarrassed to admit aloud in 2017 but i guess thats not the case for the staff here. yikes indeed"}
{"text":"Server with horrible hacking cough. Send her home for her sake and ours please. Disappointing, over priced for what you get. Eggs Bennie not good. No flavor in hollandaise, eggs hard and you can taste that the English muffins were frozen. Home fries cold. Service odd, hipster servers are trying but they miss the mark. Had to put coat on to get the bill. They offered a 50 cent discount on my breakfast."}
{"text":"A 24 hour diner in a swanky upscale hotel with a wall of vintage porcelain statues, colourful booths, marble and tile, vaulted ceilings, and flat screen televisions. I still don't know what to make of it which probably means I don't really get it. That's okay. I'm only here for the food.   Eccentricity aside, the menu is - in most ways - your typical diner fare. They have macaroni and cheese but with pancetta and truffle oil. They have fries and onion rings but served in two metal grid bowls on a wood cutting board with a fancy dipping sauce (course you only get one, extras will cost you).   Late last night my friend Minnie and I popped in for a pre-holiday Christmas feast full of fried fatty goodness and carbs five-ways.   We ate more than I'm prepared to tell you about; here are some highlights:   Buttermilk fried chicken + Cheesey mashed potatoes:     Let's congratulate this chicken for having just been added to my list of favourite dirrrtyy eats. So bad, but so good.   Let's skip the mac n cheese I've heard so much about. To those that say it's the best in the city, I would say, you're wrong.  It looks good, but again, you're wrong.        The poutine is delicious. As were the fries and onion rings with garlic aioli.   In my opinion, every city can always use another 24 hour eatery, so I'm a fan. But in the end, no matter who designed it or where it is, The Counter is mostly average comfort food, only glorified."}
{"text":"I love brunch, but I hate lining up -- this place gets points for being able to seat me immediately no matter what time I show up. The service is always on point and and food is pretty good. My only complaint is that the prices have gone up significantly since the first time I ate here!"}
{"text":"The Counter is a lucky find. Coming back from Beerfest looking for some grub we spotted The Counter out the Streetcar window. This place hit the spot.   I'm talkin about upscale diner. Fantastic onion rings, fish and chips, pountine, grilled cheese threesome!! Awesome decor and service and a bunch of sexy 20 something patrons... I highly recommend venturing south of King on Bathurst and check out The Counter."}
{"text":"I came here for the sole purpose of drinking but I ended up nibbling on a few appetizers. First of all, the entrance on Bathurst is confusing. I'd like to think of myself as average intelligence but geez, it's hard to find the door handle when it's so sleek and hidden behind a thick black curtain. I felt like a mime in box, looking for the door handle. The service was really slow. It took a long time for me to get my pint of beer. The waitress seemed friendly but it's not like she had to milk a beer cow. I don't know why but the floor tiles are offensively ugly. Why would they choose such a hideous tile? It's like an old person's basement.  We ordered the fries/onion rings and the spinach/artichoke dip. The spinach/artichoke dip comes in a iron skillet with these triangular shaped crisps that were delicious! The onion rings reminded me of a&w onion rings. thick and crispy. I'd be willing to eat lunch here one day but if I do come, I'll make sure I've got a lot of time on my hands and I'll bring a cardigan because man, it was drafty!"}
{"text":"Literally the best pancakes I have ever had in my entire life.  I really enjoy the idea of the Thompson Diner. It's fun, it's cool, the food is unique and really good. Bit on the pricey side for breakfast but for what you get it's worth it.  Kind of far from me but love making the trip down for occasional weekend brunch.   I definitely recommend this place for anybody who's never been."}
{"text":"I guess every popular place has haters and this place is fairly popular so it's fitting that there is a 3 star average. Not the case in reality.  We'd been wanting to visit for a long time and following a prog-metal concert, at 1am, seemed to be the perfect time. We were greated by a great waiter and seated perfectly by the window in their old school booths. Food is reasonably priced for the King West area and there is a wide range of favorite diner items. We had the pastrami reuben and their famous fried chicken burger. The food arrived in what seemed like a minute and a half. Beautiful plating, everything warm and fresh. Will surely be back to taste more of their items."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for awhile to try their famous Mac and cheese, and it did not disappoint! I personally loved it, very cheesy and the first bite into it was so good. The size was pretty big too, my friends and I had trouble finishing it all. I've seen in pictures that it usually comes with bread on the side but for ours, it didn't. Came here on a late night during Halloween weekend, so it was pretty busy and there was a line to get in. However, didn't have to wait very long and once seated, the server was quick to take our orders. The place is very cute and old school. I would definitely come back if I'm ever craving Mac and cheese or to try something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"While I was in Toronto for work, a handful of my fellow work colleagues took me out for the night. While we were sitting back at one their condo's we began talking about the best burgers around. Low n behold they all immediately said well you're in luck! Curios, I proceeding to ask why, it was almost midnight what could possibly be open and have a banging burger.. Sure enough one call to the downstairs diner and 15 mins later this amazing beautiful traditional steak burger shows up covered in what appeared to be a special sauce. Hands down would put many of the burgers I'm used to calling the best to shame!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a midnight milkshake, but end up ordering the Thomson burger as well. Music was great. Service was a bit slow, guess it was expected on a late Friday night. The girl that was serving us was nice.  The cheeseurger was juicy and delicious. You could see the juice falling on the plate with each bite you take. The fries weren't greasy, but it was missing salt. We don't mind since you can control your own salt. I rather have my food blend than too salty. The strawberry milkshake was delicious. It completed the massive portion of the cheeseburger.  Perfect way to end a Friday night!"}
{"text":"Previously known as \"The Counter\" the Thompson Diner is a terrific place for breakfast/brunch, lunch, dinner and drinks 24/7. The expansive menu includes great tasting selections(sandwiches, salads, grill options, anytime breakfast) and the kitchen is very flexible to accommodate modifications or off menu special requests. Cocktails are great and well priced. I eat at the Diner often and have always enjoyed my meal and overall dining experience. The waitstaff are friendly, energetic and very attentive.  If you're looking for a sure thing, go to the Diner!"}
{"text":"When I waited 10 minutes for somebody to offer me water this afternoon at The Thompson Diner, I thought perhaps the service was so poor because it is family day. The restaurant certainly seemed understaffed with servers taking on bar-tending roles or vice versa.  Now that I am leaving, still hungry after being served a wilted beet salad with chewed up looking pink beets, I have concluded that if The Thompson Diner can't handle being open on a holiday, it shouldn't be.   The service was awful. The food inedible. I will never return, and advise against going here. Even if it is 4 am and you are starving.   This isn't even good drunk food."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've eaten here and I was left with much the same opinion as the first time: This place is not as great as it wants to be. I am all for a greasy grimy diner. but The Thompson (likely because of it's location in the swanky Thompson Hotel) feels like a tarted up, glossy black malt shop. I fully expect the food to be much better than diner food. But It just isn't. In fact, it's not nearly as good as placed like the Patrician Grill or Vesta Lunch, Or New York Cafe (the latter, I've heard is in transition, so it may not be the most accurate comparison), but you get my drift, right?  I had the eggs and bacon. Super simple. But everything tasted sort of like cardboard and was uber-bland. I could get through the breakfast here with lots of hot sauce, salt and pepper but even the bacon tasted like nothing but salt. Any not really that salty, either.  Service was decent. Fast and friendly.  The food was piled on a plate that was far too small, which made eating it a chore. There was no colour and few inviting qualities as far as this plate of bacon and eggs was concerned. For a place that is so dressed up, the food certainly isn't.  It wasn't inedible, but definitely not the best breakfast out there. Any place that is open hours like this makes me doubt cleanliness and culinary inspiration. I can get on board with a down and dirty diner, but the Thompson just ain't down. It's the King Street late night tart who looks really awesome when it's dark and you're drunk, but in the stark light of day, she's just on a walk of shame complete with mascara running down her face and her hair extensions falling out.  Sad."}
{"text":"The food has no flavour..servings are ok and service is great but food lacks the character..quite overpriced with respect to quality of food they serve"}
{"text":"I gave two stars because the people that work there are really nice, it's not their fault that the food is so horrible.  Maybe it's because they are open 24 hrs?   I had poutine to go and it was awful. The gravy was cold and the cheese weren't curds.  The scrambled eggs were dry and bland, and the potatoes were soaked in oil - it was clear they weren't properly seasoned or cooked.  The toast was not toasted. This was kind of amusing. And while some may argue this is a good thing- they gave me 7 pieces of bacon that were unevenly cooked and strangely thin.   The next day I ordered a bagel to be safe but this bagel was like eating cardboard."}
{"text":"I love the decor and atmosphere. For a diner that is open so late or early into the morning(came here after a party around 3am), this place is a nice spot to  sober up and chit chat. As opposed to your usual dingy greasy spot....hey, I love them too, but it is nice to have choices. The food was ok, poutine a little salty and the chicken noodle soup had very little noodle. But since it is 3-4am in the morning, I am just happy to be eating. Mac & Cheese was yummy I must say....creamy and cheesy just the way it should always be."}
{"text":"Where do I start.  Wanted to try the Thompson for breakfast.  Not terribly busy but the service was terrible.  Waited 15 minutes for a cup of coffee.  Had to flag down the waitress for refills.  She totally ignored us. Breakfast arrived.  Toast was not toast.  Just warmed-up bread.  Eggs over medium were cold and very runny.  Potatoes were the only decent thing on our plate.  All this for $40!!!!  Really???  Will NEVER return..........."}
{"text":"Came to The Counter tonight to check out the latest edition to my building and the King West area.  It has only been open for a day, so I was hoping they had brought their A game.    I was not disappointed.  This is a strange place, decor wise.  They call themselves a diner with a modern twist.  It had diner-banquette seating with wrought iron, leather and velvet damask.  The bar featured portraits of Napoloeon, Marie Antoinette, and Louis XVI.  There were French revolution figurines, and colourful Spanish floor tiles.  A bit strange, but they did play some great music - Arcade Fire, Rolling Stones, Blur and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.    The service was great, with helpful recommendations.  Apparently they even will deliver room service to my floor!  How great is that?!  This place is also open 24hs.  Mill St. and Tankhouse ale is on tap...bottled beers run you about 8 bucks.  Now the food.  THE FOOD!  Traditional bar fare, burgers, sandwiches, fried chicken.  Also all-day brekky (sadly, no pancakes or french toast though).  We ordered a grilled cheese with a poutine upgrade, a cheeseburger with peameal bacon and a side of fries.  The grilled cheese was literally BURSTING with cheese...it was all melty all over my plate.  Oh challa bread....OMG. So good!  The poutine was also excellent....delicious gravy, curds, and even the fries had a nice spice to them.   The burger was great too..tasted very meaty and moist.  A definite contender for best burger in the area, for sure.    That and 4 beers = 70 bucks.  A bit dear considering the portion size.  Had we skipped on the booze and poutine upgrade ($6 yikes!), it would have come in at affordable.  All in all, delicious food, high quality ingredients, 24 hour service.   I can't wait to go back and try the Club, which looked AMAZING...though I might skip the $8 peanut butter and jelly sandwich!"}
{"text":"honestly, I did not expect the food to be so good here. I was skeptical and an unbeliever. I am so glad I'm wrong tho. They had Nashville hot chicken on their newly revamped menu and I had to try it (i had just watched a documentary on Nashville hot chicken lol) and it was really good. The shell was super crispy and crunchy and just a good amount of spicy. For me, I hear authentic Nashville hot chicken is super spicy and I was looking to getting my face burned off so I'm a tiny bit disappointed but I guess also relieved . The other major item I didn't expect to be so good was their mac and cheese! So cheesy and it had some sort of herb-y flavouring that gave it the right kick. Their triple B burger and breakfast platter were all great as well. I was thoroughly impressed with the food and menu. I will say that I was initially unhappy with the service received (slow, things were forgotten like butter/jam and I had to ask 3x to get it) but when I spoke with the manager, Earl, he was a lovely man who listened and then he made it right. He went above and beyond and ensured our experience ended a good one even if the service was originally subpar. Hopefully their general service improves but I'll probably be back anyways for more of that delicious mac and cheese."}
{"text":"The Pastrami Reuben with sweet potato fries was just \"OK\".  Expect a leisurely lunch \"hour\" given the understaffing."}
{"text":"when I passed by this place, I got excited and was looking forward the experience. The place is nice and the retro ambiance is there. I was greeted and shown my table. The menu simple and you will find anything from breakfast items to burgers.  First off, pricing is pretty bad $16 for a Eggs and Sausage breakfast? just it is 24/7, still. Second, at the time of my visit, I had waited about 10 min after I sat to get a waitress take my order despite eye contact and hand waiving. The place had plenty of room and there was no groups around. Once I had ordered, another 30 minutes lapsed before I received an overly oily burger. by oily I mean that oil add been spread on the bun making it very uncomfortable to eat.  I would not recommend going there and won't go there again. The food is only ok and service is very slow."}
{"text":"I would normally give this place 3 stars because the food is, in fact, 3 stars, however the hours (it's open 24/7!) and the great downtown location have earned it 4.  I had the all day classic breakfast. It was pretty average, nothing special. The eggs were good. The hashbrowns were so-so. The service was a little slow, our waitress wasn't very attentive. I'll definitely be back because of the super close walking distance to my place and the hours. I'm glad it's there!"}
{"text":"ORDER THIS: Turkey sandwich with melted Brie on a ciabatta bun with sweet potato fries and a chicken salad with crispy bacon, avocado, and egg in a subtle blue cheese dressing.   KEY FEATURES: -cool ambiance  -good portions -good service  -decent prices"}
{"text":"I was hunting like a mad woman for food that my body would hate me for, so I decided to stop by the Thompson Diner for a little dinner.  My overall experience was very good, and although there was only one man attending to to the tables, he did a great job of making sure that everyone's needs were being met.   My friend and I decided to order the nachos to start, and then I had the double mac and cheese, while she had the fried chicken with cheddar mashed potatoes. Here's my rundown on the food: -Nachos: awesome! Super cheesy and I loved the fresh tomatoes and jalepenos that were scattered about. It also came with a side of salsa, sour cream, and guac -Double mac and cheese: I loved it, but I think there was just a tad bit too much truffle oil in there that it became a bit overpowering at times, but other than that, it was the ultimate comfort food taken to the next level. My friend also loved (and devoured) her fried chicken and cheddar mash (the cheddar mash looked amazing)  I can eat quite a bit, but the portions are really big, so I didn't even finish half of my mac and cheese and the nachos we're only half way done.   I really liked this place and the service was quite good. Just a warning: they don't take debit, but they take everything else so keep that in mind when you give them a visit.  I'll surely be back :)"}
{"text":"The Thompson Diner is a standby favorite but the recent menu changes are a big downgrade for this former Toronto treasure. Now resting on its laurels, the quality of the food, the service, and the overall attention to detail seems to be flagging. The take away is that when you offer outstanding food and service in a hip, cool atmosphere, you can get away with charging a fortune for the food. When the food is lackluster and the service is poor, then the menu prices should reflect that. Unfortunately, that's not the case at the Thompson Diner. The prices are as high as ever, and the food has slid a few pegs.  The famous omlettes served on a piping hot griddle are still here but the griddle is no longer even warm and the signature choices (caramelized onions) and variety of add-ins (like green peppers) have been significantly downgraded and the limited number of choices makes me think that the kitchen is more of a heat-up pre-portioned place than it is an actual kitchen. The choices for vegetarians and gluten free folks (compared to the former menu) are almost nil.   Definitely a significant step down from its former self.   In addition the place seems understaffed compared to a few years ago and the hipster edge seems to be gone. Now, it seems like any other diner with a resentful crew -- lots of attitude and not a lot of smiles."}
{"text":"After a night of drinks on the rooftop patio at the Drake Hotel, a friend from Chicago and I made our way to the new Thompson Hotel to try out their rooftop bar. As we walked there, my friend kept commenting on how alive and vibrant Toronto seemed. I began to look at this city through new eyes (you know how that happens when your'e showing a visiter around). We got to the new hotel and were drawn to its restaurant along Bathurst Street. At that point I started to see Toronto through new eyes. What a great place!  We poked our head in and asked the waiter if they were still open (I find that most businesses in Toronto close peculiarly early). He told us that of course they were still open, they're open 24 HOURS A DAY! This is my dream concept. Just the thought of being able to grab a meal at 4:30 AM gets me all excited inside. I grew up in Saskatchewan where there was always a peculiarly high amount of 24-hour establishments everywhere. I chalk it up to the booming trucker industry in middle Canada.  Several years ago, I worked at a cafe with a friend and we'd plan an ungodly early breakfast once a week before our shift started. We did heavy-duty research into the 24-hou options in Toronto. There were very few at that time. We'd end up at Frans more than we liked to, just because of the limits. How I wish The Counter was open back then. I don't think we would have gone anywhere else!  The night I visited, my friend and I split the Mediterranean dip trio--it was excellent and generously portioned. Perfect snack. He had a glass of wine served in a tumbler (which I find so cute) and I had a coffee. This is where the four-star rating comes in. I'd give The Counter five stars if my second cup didn't taste toxic. I'm not sure what happened; the first cup was excellent, but the second tasted dangerous to my health. I will up the rating if this was a one-off situation.  Two of my stars goes towards the decor and service: the room is huge and decorated to be a high-end diner. It's all about contradictions. Tacky-fancy, as I like to call it. My server--the servers wear gingham shirts and bow ties, by the way--was extra cute. He apologized for being new on the job as he figured out the best way to hold more than one dish at a time. Very charming.  I can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu. I'm especially excited to go early in the morning, sit with my laptop, sip a (hopefully drinkable) coffee and watch the craziness a 24-hour restaurant must attract."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised this place has gotten the good reviews it has. I've been here a few times for dinner and just went for brunch yesterday. The overpriced food is really nothing to write home about and the service has always been unfriendly and sub par.   I was shocked to see that the least expensive item on the brunch menu was around $12... and the rest were $15-$17. I know eggs Benedict can be on the expensive side but the Drake does an amazing version and only charges $14 or so for it. I had the breakfast burrito for $17 and it was mediocre at best. It came with coffee and juice but the juice tasted like it came from a frozen can and the coffee was actually undrinkable (very burnt!). My friend had regular poutine, which came with melted cheese on top vs. cheese curds (they couldn't even get poutine right!)   The service is what really ruined the experience though. Our server took nearly 15 minutes to clear our plates and give us our bills and then when we had our money out to pay she didn't return for another 10 - so we had to ask another server to take our payment. I guess people come here for the convenient King and Bathurst location and the diner-esque menu, but they'd really be better off eating at the McDonalds down the street."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here while going to and fro from Chill House. We ordered immediately, but we had to wait 1 hour for our food - this was a ridiculously hangry wait. My chicken and waffles were what I would imagine eating dry wall would taste like. What was supposed to be buttermilk waffles tasted like waffles made with flour and egg only.  The chicken was like the Sahara Desert and flavour was non-existent.  Last but not least my BF's chicken fingers had a sharp bone in it, which was odd because even the server noted that the fingers should be boneless.  He unfortunately cut the inside of his mouth because of this, which only worsened our experience here on top of the wait and automatic 18 percent gratuity.  Although this establishment is open 24/7 and is in the heart of downtown Toronto I would highly avoid coming here if you want to maintain your fun night out."}
{"text":"Went around 330am after a night out in the summer with my girlfriends and I was happy with the service and the fact they served breakfast at 330am made my drunk heart melt(almost cried that's how happy I was)  We got lucky and got seating fairly fast, I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and waffles. My friend ordered mac n cheese and wings. We shared both ordered a burger to go for some reason drunk us thought it would be a good idea. We lost it somewhere on the way home but that's a story for another time.   Pricing was average, the clientele that late are usually drunk and loud. I would love it even more if they had reservations that late but it's not sensible to do so.   I'll be back Thompson diner!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had initially made plans to have dinner at The Home of the Brave. Well, it was a Friday night at around 7:30 pm and the place was packed! Unfortunately, they don't take reservations for groups under 8 and we were told that there would be a 45 minute wait. I left my number with the hostess, but there were quite a few people ahead of us. So, we ventured down to the Thompson Diner and we're glad that we did! I have been meaning to try this place for quite a while, as it serves up a lot of comfort food, which is always nice during the autumn and winter seasons.  As soon as my friend and I decided on what we were going to order, I get a phone call from the hostess at HOTB. Uh-oh, what to do? We had been waiting for a long time to try that place, but we were seated here and had already made up our minds on what we wanted to order. Being the polite Canadians that we are, we decided to pass on HOTB and stayed.  We ended up sharing two mains and two desserts. My friend ordered the West Coast Burger with sweet potato fries, which was very satisfying and delicious. I ordered the Buttermilk Chicken with cheddar mashed potatoes, and while I loved the crispy chicken, the mashed potatoes were less than stellar and a little lumpy.   We should have passed on the desserts, as we both disliked what we ordered. My friend had  the Warm Gingerbread with salted caramel gelato. I had the chocolate fudge cake, which was dry and probably thawed out from the freezer. My friend's choice was a little better than mine, but neither of us could finish them.   Service was fine, albeit it a little slow. The interior was dimly lit with a lot of comfortable booths. I think I would return to this greasy spoon to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"During our visit to this wonderful city we decided to give this diner a try since it had caught our attention earlier when we had visited the rooftop lounge. my boyfriend and I tried the chicken club sandwich which was delicious (probably best we had tried) and at that moment hit the spot.  As we were getting ready to head out and paying our bill I see a cockroach right next to my boyfriend. He stood up to let the waitress know but she just shrugged it off and did nothing about it. I mean i get it, she's not going to cause a scene to scare everyone else but at least pretend to care and pretend to do something about it. It was a shocker and disappointment after this."}
{"text":"I love that this place is open 24/7. The service was prompt but the prices are a little higher than a \"diner\". I'd say its more of a casual restaurant. Bacon and eggs were great and they weren't stingy either.  Will return."}
{"text":"I've been here many times before, but rarely am downtown to take advantage of their amazing late night hours.  On this occasion we ordered the Double Mac & Cheese and the \"Voted #1 Toronto's Poutine\". With a name like that, you kind of raise your expectations... and then the disappointment set in. Not only have I had better fries and gravy, but I've had far better duck too. Also, cheese curds are what makes or breaks a Poutine. These did not taste like curds, but more like grated melted cheese.  The Mac and Cheese wasn't anything special either. We remembered it being better in the past. It was just warm pasta with melted cheese, and didn't taste like a dish that was put together with a purpose. But then again, it's just Mac and cheese, so you can't expect too much.  As I mentioned above, I have been here several times so I won't let one visit tarnish my overall opinion on the place. I would still come back and try some other items instead"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is getting rated so low. Been here a number of times and it might not be the best in Toronto, but it's pretty damn good for a 24hr diner.  Came here last night, had some tasty bloody chicken fingers, and went home.  It's usually busy, but not packed (there is an after-club rush though at 2.30am), the prices are decent, and the food is high quality. I would only recommend sticking to actual diner fare...don't go too fancy, it's not what the place is made for."}
{"text":"Listen, I'm an American. I understand how the world sees us. We're fat, we eat horrible, greasy things, and we eat a lot. I get it. Calling the fattiest, worst thing for you item on your menu \"The Fat American\" is a clever joke, but we're not all like that. Some of us eat healthy. It's an unfair stereotype.  The Fat American was delicious. Bacon and sausage stuffed pancakes topped with a fried egg and onion strings? *drool* I want to order one right now.   We also had onion rings and fries and they were also delicious.  I was disappointed in my drink, that's why I've given only 4 stars. I ordered a screwdriver (because it's the 1970s, apparently) and it wasn't very good. But I will definitely go back, especially since it's 24hrs and around the corner from my house."}
{"text":"A few friends and I decided to check out Thompson Diner late one Friday night. It wasn't too busy, and we were able to get a seat within 10 minutes. We were all super excited by the menu items and ordered 3 mac and cheeses and 2 milkshakes. The service was horrible, we had to ask many times just for water, and our food took at least 40 minutes to arrive at our table. Once we began eating, the food was also so disappointing. It was salty and had no other flavours. I was super disappointed as I love mac & cheese, and I had wanted to try out Thompson Diner for quite some time :(   Note: this review is based on my visit a year ago, I very much hope that the diner has improved since then!"}
{"text":"24/7 diner; near city place; all day breakfasts;burgers at 4 am.   A place that is begging drunken friends to dine together and recall their experiences from the night. A place where you can kick off your heels and face no judgement (under the table of course). A place where one can recant all vows of clean living under a drunken haze.   Perhaps it was all of the above that put Thompson's Diner high in my estimation. I have many favourite late night eateries where I like to sit with friends and have great banter;Thompson diner is firmly added to said list.  I had a burger which seemed like the King of All Burgers. That said, it was very delicious. service is fast; our server jovial despite the time being ridiculous o'clock.   Reasonably priced, all in all great experience."}
{"text":"Great food. Really cool place with great atmosphere. Service and wait time for food must have improved because we got our food in a reasonable time. I ordered the the crispy chicken sandwich with fries and gravy and my friend ordered there Thompson burger and we both loved it. I would definitely come back and eat here again."}
{"text":"Fantastic 24 hr Diner  Chicken & Waffles were outstanding.  Sprinkled with some green onions gave the fluffy waffle a nice savoryiness and of course maple syrup on both the waffles and the chicken and a little Mayo with some chipolitie. Not over powering at all just a nice little flavour.  The chicken was cooked perfectly with the crunchist skin with wonderful flavour.  Mixed with a nice tall Stella.....great brunch !  Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"There are many negative comments about the service here. I must just be ridiculously lucky for never having experienced it, considering how many times I've been here. One cannot argue with the masses, though. If you come here during the weekend, expect insanity. If you come here on a weekday, the law of averages says that you'll have a bad service experience. If the food was phenomenal, it may be possible to explain away the bad service to some sort of pompous elitism. Unfortunately, it's hard to get a deli menu wrong, especially one as efficiently constructed as the menu at The Counter. They get the food right, thankfully. It's just not anything to write home about. To be frank: When you compare it to the other fare around the area (e.g. Banknote, Wheat Sheaf, and St. Louis), The Counter is in a class of its own, both in terms of a standard of quality and an expectation of the type of person patronizing the establishment. As such, I'm holding it to a high standard, along the lines of a typical Toronto gastro pub. In this respect, it falls short of greatness. All that being said, The Counter is a solid choice to get a pint and some takeout, if you live or work in the area."}
{"text":"We got seated immediately. But no one bothered to even look after us. People beside us got their bill, the table beside us was turned over, the table behind us got their food. In the span of 15 minutes, not one person acknowledged I us or even asked us if we wanted some water. Terrible service. If it was possible to give 0 stars, I would. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"I'm dismayed to write this review as I rarely give 1 star (& I'm inclined to put none) but based on some friends who have come here before,it will get 1 for now.  Let's start off by saying I came with a few VIP's from the Juno's after-party, after the party (lol) to eat some major food! We walked in, took the left side of the place-there's the right side which has a bar; it wasn't overly busy then. We got seated immediately. Good, here's where it starts to go downhill already. We waited for 30 minutes for the server to come to take our orders! We give our food & Drink orders all at once- fine we figure it may take 30 minutes for the food to cook, but the guy server never came back with our drink order! We slowly sipped our water that another girl server brought us. Well wait wait wait....you getting the idea? After waiting almost 2 hours! Yes ridiculous I know - normally I wouldn't entertain waiting so long but it was the only place open in the late night/early morn hour & we had a table of 10 people. I asked my friend if this was normal & he said it's generally slow here but it was beyond compare at this point! So I flagged our server down & asked to check on the food and let us know how much longer (we waited this long, we figured maybe 10-15 minutes more).  Well he never came back! I kept saying to my friends \"oh maybe it's coming now-just give it 10 more mintes; We decided to leave! I really tried to hold out & give this place a chance. Oh guess who we see now? Our Server. He did this fake \"apologetic\" sort of excuse that the kitchen couldn't handle the amount of people that came in after us. I don't think he even put our order in. Just a note- I watched food keep going out from the kitchen to the bar side (some people that came waaaay after our table) now I knew some of the other people sitting at the other tables because some of them just came from the same party as we did. I did notice this place seems to attract quite the \"pimping-hooker\" crowd. (They were quick to give them attention- even the \"manager\" on duty rushed over to them) hmmmm. Things that make you go hmmm?  Anyway we left after waiting over 2 hours & left extremely annoyed & hungry. What a waste of our time -this place lost HUGE bucks because even though we all ordered lots of food; the loss was to the server for one as my friends whom I were with are \"big tippers!\" Two, I will never go here again (I'm not one to say never) but it's a first.  All of my friends were staying at the Thompson Hotel, so if this Diner is associated with this hotel...Shock & dismay. I read some of the reviews just before writing this so even more disappointed that I didn't get to have a good experience not even minutely!  Clean up your act for the late night crowd!  Epic Fail. :("}
{"text":"Hey Thompson Diner, way to colossally ruin a good thing!! As a neighbourhood regular i'm so disappointed to see the changes to your classic diner menu.   Had the unfortunate experience of ordering your \"Cobb\" Salad today. You know what a Cobb Salad is, right?? What it's not is a bed of oily pre-dressed shredded romaine with chickpeas and celery.  I had to add in the avocado myself at an additional charge and there is no turkey.  And sorry, you're serving it with a red wine vinaigrette?? Fortunately, i had heard you were no longer serving bleu cheese dressing and brought my own from home... i hope you'll see the error of your ways and bring back a favourite classic you used to do so well. Until then, I guess you're not my go-to anymore. what a shame..."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wed night looking for comfort food. Ordered deviled eggs (nothing special), roasted cauliflower (tasty but 16.00- due to romesco variety?). Shishito peppers was the dish that saved the visit.Service OK."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Myself and a few friends came here around 2:15am after a late night out. There was a really long wait to get in even at that time of night . Aside from that, the food was really good. We ordered the mac and cheese, chicken fingers with the classic poutine,  and quesadillas. Service was good and the prices were fair."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my sister. I have to say if you live near by this could be a good place to go for brunch if you don't have an idea as to where to go. The food here I would say is good. The prices of their menu is en par with other brunch menus in the area. The servers here are nice and friendly too. Overall, I would say this place is average, at least for their brunch menu (I have not tried their lunch or dinner menu yet). To be very honest, I thought this place was just average. There wasn't anything that really captivated me. After my brunch experience here, I was more like \"meh... this is okay I guess...\" I think I was expecting a little more."}
{"text":"Finally decided to check out Thompson diner after hearing some mixed reviews about this place. The menu was really what motivated me to go, specifically the $13 breakfast poutine and a brunch burger with a donut bun! My stomach and taste buds were excited to venture out to this fancy shmancy diner.  The atmosphere is pretty casual and relaxed despite the location of the restaurant. There was a line up at the door which is not a surprise for Saturday brunch hours however we did not have to wait a long time for a table. When we first walked in it was a little disorganized in terms of seating people as there are 2 doors at the entrance but everyone eventually figured out who was at the front of the line.  The staff was very friendly however the service was just a tad slow but it seemed like they may have been understaffed that day as I noticed our waiter was serving all the tables. I ordered the breakfast poutine and the smoothie of the day (strawberry banana orange). The smoothie was okay. They could have cut back on the orange juice so that some of the banana and strawberry flavours could come through but it was still pretty good. My breakfast poutine was good but not great. The portion was pretty big - I couldn't finish it all so if you aren't that hungry you might want to share this with someone else. The breakfast poutine consisted of: french fries, 1 poached egg, hollandaise sauce, gravy, mozzarella cheese, & turkey sausage. I was not too impressed with the fries. I felt they could have been cooked a little bit longer. Maybe even double fried. The poached egg and hollandaise sauce I enjoyed but I was not much of a fan of the mozzarella cheese. Cheese curds would have made it much better.   Overall, good experience. Good food and service. I would like to come back again and order something different from their menu since they have loads of exciting things to try!"}
{"text":"Limited menu but good food!   First off let me say it was spacious and clean. The washroom could use a bit more cleaning. The waitress was pleasant. Seated us right away and was friendly. The food did not come super quick but it wasn't super long. I'd say it was reasonable wait time.   The truffle mac and cheese... is the bomb dot com!!!! Like so comforting, so yummy,  I wanted seconds. The pasta was perfectly cooked. An amazing amount of cheese and crunch on top. Omg drooooling over it. It's my favourite item that I've tried so far!   I also got the pastrami Rueben, it was good, tasty but I'm not blown away by it. The cut of the meat is good but idk I wanted a BAM factor, the slices of rye bread was cut well too but I wanted it toasted a bit.   The Crispy chicken sandwich I had a bite off from it coz it was my BF's order... it was a big piece of chicken thigh. Very crispy and Juicy. I enjoyed the brioche bun! But the sauce I think it needed a bit more mayo in my opinion but it had the right amount of spicy to it.   I felt like the onion rings portions was a bit small... but eh what can I say they taste like regular onion rings which is good.  I heard the milkshakes are the bomb dot com so I'd have to come back to confirm and I will definitely get the Mac and cheese truffle and maybe add bacon to it!!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. For me, the appetizer and entrée were fine but both were incredibly small in terms of portion size, especially considering the prices charged for them. As for my companion's order, they messed that up altogether. A couple of other flubs as well from the server. This place has been better in the past, and I hope it gets there again."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday just before notorious Brant Thursdays and food wasn't too bad.  You get some free pretzel sticks to start and I had chicken fingers which came with chipotle mayo. This isn't fine dining but it's a lot better then Jack Astors in terms of finger and bar food. It's open 24H so a great place to go IMO for after King W clubbing.   I was there around 7pm and it was quite dead, but service was still prompt and courteous.   All in all no complaints, decent food, price, and service, no special wow factor but you get what you expect at the very least."}
{"text":"Great French toast. Great eggs and pea meal bacon.   Service was a little bad.  Only reason it got three stars instead of four."}
{"text":"If Denny's is a diner, then The Counter is it's cool, hip, city cousin: sleek, chic, and sophisticated. The interior has a modern look (dark countertops and wood surfaces) but with a nod to classic diner style (vinyl bar stools, big booths).  The food was quite good overall, but there were hits and misses. I had the buttermilk fried chicken, which I thought was terrific -- freshly fried, perfectly crisp, and the chicken was juicy. It sent shivers down my spine. Plus, there was a LOT of chicken. It is served in a little metal bucket, and they crammed a lot of chicken pieces in there. It never ended. I even had enough leftover to take home for a midnight snack. ;)   Also, instead of the cheddar mash to accompany, I substituted poutine. Lemme tell you, kids, the poutine is DELICIOUS. Generous amount of cheese curds, smooth gravy, crispy fries. Definitely some of the best poutine I've had in Toronto thus far.  OTOH, the meat on my husband's burger was overcooked and dry. The bun was nice (brioche?), but other than that, the burger was basically forgettable.   Service was pretty decent, other than a little snafu with our bill in which the server brought the wrong change. Not a huge deal, but it pays to be vigilant.   The round-the-clock hours are definitely a plus. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"My colleagues brought me here when I was on a work trip and I loved the concept. I believe there is a hotel upstairs? Don't quote me. I got a bowl of Chipotle Carrot soup and the Truffle Mac n Cheese. It was PERFECT since it was Toronto wintering pretty hard outside. I added Sriracha to my mac and it was the best decision of my life. I was pretty stoked that they had Sriracha in the first place. I was expecting some Tapatio (ew). The service was ok. Not great but not bad."}
{"text":"This place has so many reviews! Let me add my 2 cents...  I went on a weekday evening. It was not busy, maybe 5? other people there other than us  1. Atmosphere: I was excited to check out the counter, its retro diner look at the bottom of a modern condo seemed like a cool combo. the wooden tables, soft lighting, bench seats gave it a homey feel...but there was still a cold edge to the place. It really isnt a family friendly, remind you archie's comics type of hangout. maybe the counter is trying 'too hard' to be cool...   2. Food: very, very average. I had a grilled cheese sandwich, pretty much could of made the same thing at home with my toaster and a block of cracker barrel from the metro (oh did i just give away the secret recipe used at the counter?) moving on, the fries served with my sandwich were hot and tasty, and came in the cutest lil frying basket.  3. Service: i think our waiter was on something. while we were looking at the menus (a time period of ~5minutes?) the guy came over four times 'are you ready yet?'. Yikes. To the counter's benefit, they did serve our food super fast, we waited less than 10 minutes between ordering to being served.  Overall, I thought the counter was average. Yes, it would be a cool spot to hang out at 3 in the morning..but so would just about anyplace serving warm food! It just doesnt live up to its image..."}
{"text":"If you're drunk or just want to pig out a bit, this is the place. Their mac and cheese is to die for. Place is old fashioned, but always fun and lively."}
{"text":"This place reeks of hipster and puts a definite twist on breakfast on King W. in Toronto. A definite relief from the blow-hards on the East side. Simple menu, good execution, to the point, with a team of super friendly and cheerful waiters even for 6:00 am. Love the laid back attitude and great place to gather your thoughts when about to tackle the day."}
{"text":"Food was good and filling, even though one eggy Benny was way over cooked, and the staff were supwr polite and apologetic.   The one thing that irked me the most was the manager's incapability to foresee that the Sporting Life 10k would bring volumes of runners and their friends/family. To my understanding, the place becomes packed every year post run. Needless to say, they were so understaffed to handle all the large groups coming in, that the manager himself was taking orders. On top of that, it took us 20 minutes to get the bill. Next year, schedule some extra servers for the day."}
{"text":"Heh. Ok if you;re in need for late night eats... overall, not impressive."}
{"text":"Thompson diner was pretty good. The make your own omelet makes it easy for most people to eat there. My omelet was super tasty. The downside would be the bread was just meh but the jam was amazing so I guess it evens out. Also the latte was not hot, and the tea came in a pot that made it very difficult to not spill everywhere. Also I just felt like there weren't enough servers for how busy it was, no one came around to ask if we needed anything and we never got water. I would probably go back though the omelet was tasty."}
{"text":"This place is great because its opened really late and always easy to get a table. I've been here twice once around brunch time and once at dinner time both on weekends and never had a problem being seated, good option for a weekend dinner when everything else is all booked.   The service is usually on the slower side though and you may get forgotten at times when you're sitting in the back or a corner but the servers are friendly. I always get the mac and cheese (Approx. $14) comes nice and hot on a little skillet, lots of cheesy sauce with some crispy bits on top, the garlic toasts are also super garlicy and crispy great to mop up the cheesy goodness at the bottom. Other portions for food also look pretty big. Not my usual go-to but always a steady option."}
{"text":"I was very pleases with my experience at the Thompson Diner. I arrived at the diner at 1 30 am on a Monday morning. My two friends and I chose to sit at the bar as the waiter told us we could sit anywhere we would like because it wasn't busy enough for the server to have to chose for us. The bartender said there's a line up out the door at that time during the weekend. My friends ordered beers and said that the prices were great compared to the trashy bar they were at earlier. I ordered the 3 egg omelette that comes with 3 ingredients. I chose olives, Swiss, mushrooms and onions for the additional 1. 50 or something for an extra ingredient. Plate came with homefries and toast with classy glass jam jars. My bill came to like 14 dollars which was great and very fair for the type of quality it was for a 24 hour diner. The bartender was very friendly as were all the other employees. Atmosphere was a little fancy but cheap fancy which I like! Menu was pretty basic at those hours, I wonder if it's any different during the day."}
{"text":"Great portions, price, location and service.  A good place for a meal before a show at the Factory Theatre.  Do not order the sparkling water but the spinach salad was awesome."}
{"text":"- food very MEDIOCRE (see picture)  The mushroom beef Burger was extremely dry and oily  - portions not worth money: cheap with a minimal amount of mushroom. Never seen any restaurant cheating out so much (see picture)  - service was SLOW. We were served by a Mexican water that didn't check in on us, water was never filled. Everything was bad with service."}
{"text":"Great place to go with friends after the bar! The truffle Mac and cheese is to die for!"}
{"text":"Didn't really know what to expect from this place, and just a few nights ago we were wandering around looking for a place to eat and just decided to give this place a go.   I was a bit disappointed with the menu.  It just lacked variety and anything that was inspiring; anything that hinted try-me.  So we settled for crab cakes, a beef Swiss burger and a turkey burger.  Crab cakes were good.  They used real crab meat and I could tell they weren't the pre-made frozen ones.  Beef Swiss Burger.  Nothing special at all. The beef patty was like any patty.  I also found it a bit under seasoned and not particularly juicy.  For $13 I expected it to be of better quality.  I had the onion rings as a side, and it came with 4 large sized hand battered rings.  They were battered (not breaded) and tasted like what onion rings should.  Turkey Burger.  They turkey breast was juicy and well seasoned and probably one of the better turkey burgers I've seen."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*  Being a big brunch person ~ i was totally stoked to come here.  Loved the decor, and the company was great!  We were shown a menu that had higher prices than what we were charged, kind of an interesting concept.    I ordered the eggs benny.  The hollandaise was less creamy than I'm used to, but still quite tasty.  I'm not a huge fan of potatoes, but I like the way they make them here.  For some reason they're a bit sweet (which i don't mind a bit).  One of my DC's ordered the \"big breakfast\" (I don't think it's called that).  He was a fan.  My other DC ordered the largest pile of buttermilk pancakes ever.  The portion sizes are really substantial.  Everything was great, we'll be back. PS.  we saw actor Shane West, so if you're up for some Celeb watching, then you might run into some here."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday eve around 9pm. Wasn't overly busy, was seated quickly.  Standard diner decor, in a reclaimed old building adjoining the Thompson Hotel.  I ordered the pastrami Reuben with fries and a chocolate milkshake. All came pretty quickly, the milkshake was yummy, not too thick. Fries hot and crisp.  The sandwich came on rye bread with caraway seeds, sauerkraut and melted Swiss cheese. Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Overall a great meal, a little on the pricy side but typical for downtown. Would def go back!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken curry, some of the chicken was still raw, I told the server and she didn't believe me so I showed her and she was apologetic. It happens but it really put me off the food there."}
{"text":"I am fond of diners. Something about an eatery opened 24 /7 is both seedy and alluring; sexy and pragmatic....Maybe I've seen too many movies.  The Thompson Diner falls in the latter category. I came here for a quick bite before evening class. I ordered the smoked turkey sandwich with sweet potatoe fries. The presentation is divine: it is served in a wooden cutting board & the fries come in a mini fryer!  The sandwich is grilled and quite tasty. The fries unfortunately came cold; but still edible. The server was efficient. Quick service.  One important thing to know before patronizing this establishment: only cash & credit card taken. No debit."}
{"text":"Clean & upscale diner, the Mac and cheese is to die for. Live close by, convenient that it's open 24 hours! Good for late night."}
{"text":"been here three times for breakfast.  the food is okay.  had the eggs Benny today.  the hollandaise was good, the potatoes were okay.  today we were served by a guy who acted as though he was too good for us.  took our orders (I'm glad we put our food and drink order in at the same time time or we may never have eaten) delivered our drinks and we didn't see him again until it was time for the bill, which he delivered with a reluctant refill of my wife's coffee.  ten minutes later before he returned with the card machine.  he earned his shit tip."}
{"text":"What do you write when there has already been a ton of reviews?  Gosh  I am a huge fan of diners.  I don`t care if it`s shiny and slick like this one or just plain old and just hangin on.  I never expect to be blown away by the food but this location kinda makes you expect more. It is weak in that delivery.  Not the greatest food. The breakfast option I had was tasty (scrambled eggs, potatoes and sausage) but a bit overcooked.  I can`t argue on the sheer coolness of the place.  However, you pay for it. Not ìnexpensive but I think worth it if you want to go to somewhere decent late, late, late at night.  This is 24 hour fabulousness.   I would go back again especially because of  excellent customer service."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! I love the food here, everything is so delicious, and so unique. I remember having the grilled cheese burger here, it was incredible...A little too much even to say the least haha. Just imagine a grilled cheese sandwich and then a burger and then another grilled cheese sandwich! Like seriously, all of that together to form the magnificent GRILLED CHEESEBURGER! Sadly, I couldn't finish it, it was just too much, but SO EPIC. Best part about this place is that its 24hrs baby, that's right, check it out whenever you want. :)"}
{"text":"Brunch is pretty okay here. It's nice that its open 24/7 so great for late nights or super late brunches in my case. It's got your classic diner feel so a bit grungy and the service isn't the best, but for a quick meal it's definitely not bad."}
{"text":"Their burgers seem to lack 'integration' -- they look good, and are huge, but the bun seems disconnected from the burger.  They make an alcoholic mud-slide milk-shake that is 10/10. Did not see it on the menu last time but they pulled it off.  The food seems to be designed to 'photograph well', and is generally well prepared, but could stand some tweaks to make it more delicious (see integration).  Twice my guests and I had to disassemble the burger into component pieces to eat it.  If it were more 'diner' like it would be greasier -- the food they make is not greasy enough! :) haha"}
{"text":"Feeling hungry after a show at The Hoxton, we ventured to the nearby Thompson Diner, which is open 24 hours.   I liked the vibe of the place, and the service was good. Our server was somehow seemingly on fast forward, especially considering it was 1 am. I'm talking extra extra cheerful and energetic.   We ordered burgers and a spiked milkshake to share (Guinness).  The shake was awesome. After quite a long wait, the burgers my friends got (beef) were apparently some of the worst/driest they've ever had, and had to be slathered in ketchup and mayo.   I ordered the turkey burger with Swiss and mushrooms wrapped in lettuce just to be different, and we agreed that  it was the best option, although the mushrooms were undetectable.   The sweet potato fries were served  cold, and clearly from a package. The little side salads were served with an inexplicably large amount of vinaigrette on the side, which was much too overpowering in my opinion.   I would have given this place 2 stars based on the burgers, but due to the hyper-professional service and that killer milkshake, it deserves three.   And hey, it's way better than Fran's!"}
{"text":"Strange experiences in the few times I've been there. I heard about this place through co-workers when we all worked at a private club that stayed open until the early hours so naturally the food options are pretty sparse at that time. They were pretty enthusiastic about and given my love of classic 50's style diners, I was down to give it a try.  First time I went, I saw that they had footlong hot dogs in the menu and several different kinds. Dogs are usually something that restaurants only have on the kids menu or you have to hit a food cart to find, and I gotta' admit as gross as they can be I still love 'em, so I gave the whistle dog a try. First thing I noticed was the bun was stale and they had tried to compensate by over toasting it. The hot dog was the cheap kind you get at lower end street near stops which didn't help. Fries were okay. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't that great either. Still, when a friend suggested we go another time, I was willing to give it another shot. Ordered the poutine Quebecoise. Pretty ho-hum. Definitely not from Quebec, otherwise the cheese would have been melted and the gravy better quality. Somehow I made it a third time and got the burger. It wasn't bad.  What holds me back from giving this place more stars is the potential it has to be so much better. From what you've read, I've never had terrible food there, but nothing spectacular either. The service has always been fairly good but the food is always just sub-par, and that's disappointing because from the exterior and decor and the act that it's attached to the Thompson hotel, you'd think it would be better. If it had food the quality of a real greasy spoon and at the cherry location they're at, they'd be swamped all the time but they're not. It's never been very busy when I've gone.   Try it out if you're just hungry, but bring the clients to the Keg."}
{"text":"A perfect spot for cravings and the ultimate comfort. Very nice service and warm and friendly manager. It was a pleasant evening with my friends. The Mac and cheese is a must get to share with your friends. Grilled cheese burger was the perfect amount and not overwhelming or too much of it. The Sante Fe Salad was my favorite and what I ordered! Love love this place for cravings and for comfort food"}
{"text":"Keep trying to like this place but the food is so basic, poorly done, and overpriced. I could make better, myself! This is supposed to be a part of a 4 Star hotel. $12 basic deserts?  An ongoing disappointment."}
{"text":"AMAZING mac and cheese. I've tried many mac and cheeses in my time and this is one of my favourites by far. So cheesy and yummy. My friend made a comment about wishing the top of the dish was crunchier, so that you could break into a cheesy middle, and I agree. That would've made it a perfect dish. The servers are very cute due to their matching old-school uniforms, and the location is in a good place (right around club district, also open late) and has a cool vintage vibe. I went in with friends on Halloween weekend (Saturday before Halloween which was a very busy night dt) and there was a line when we got there but they seated us pretty fast. The security was also friendly. Overall a great place!"}
{"text":"The fried chicken now has flavor. Not a lot so the included ranch dressing helps, as does the hot sauce I liberally poured on the chicken. It's also $18 and comes w/ a big bowl of mashed potatoes topped w/ a rectangle of cheddar cheesed. I still prefer Stockyards and Popeyes fried chicken."}
{"text":"Horrifically slow service, and expensive for what you get.  The Mac and cheese is amazing though, and Caesar's were decent.  But sloooooowest service I've had in Toronto in a while."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an American-style diner breakfast this is a good place to go. Nothing fancy, just good food and decent portions.  We had the omelette with home fries and toast and it was exactly what we were looking for. I added jalapeno to my omelette and that was amazing--never had that option before at breakfast place and it added such a nice spice to it. The food was good, and not greasy like a couple of other diners around.  Breakfast is available all day so this is the perfect place to nurse a late-morning hangover with some pancakes and bacon."}
{"text":"Came here to avoid Second Cup as I needed a place to stay warm at near The Hoxton that would have acceptable dessert options. This establishment is open 24/7 and is really cozy. We ordered one of their mason jar desserts to share, the banana dulce de leche tower. I was going to order a tea as well, until I noticed they charge $4 for them. Methinks not.  The dessert itself didn't WOW me, but I wasn't expecting it to. It was fairly decent however! The tower consists of banana bread, caramel syrup, whipped cream, dulce de leche freshly sliced banana. I noted how moist the banana bread was. This dessert hit the spot despite its humble execution. I would order it again. The staff here were also very nice. There are more appealing places nearby (Forno Cultura, Lee, Thor, Wvrst) but it's nice to know I can depend on this place as a solid option in the future if I ever need something late night. Maybe I'll get the chance to try their savoury food in the future."}
{"text":"Po boy good // onion rings great!"}
{"text":"Whoahhhh! $8 for a PB & J sandwich?!  Don't expect to a cheap meal when you come to eat at the newly opened The Counter. It's an upscale diner, not a greasy spoon. Between my friend and I, our two sandwiches with side upgrades, a coffee and a juice, came to $47. And this was lunch, not dinner.   But I knew that I'd have to dish out more dinero since I was sitting in the Thompson Hotel's new boutique resto. Still, simple sandwiches like a reuben may be too pricey for my liking ($14), other sandwiches like the Shrimp Po'Boy ($14) and Salmon Platter ($14) sounded absolutely delicious. Kudos to The Counter for offering different options instead of the usual diner fare.   I will agree with Kelly O. that the food here is good, hence the reason why you're paying a little bit for it. You could go across the street to the Wheat Sheaf to get something similar but it wouldn't be as tasty, a little bit more greasy and it would probably leave a bad taste in your mouth.   Plus, they don't skimp on the portions; my reuben was so big that I had difficulty finishing it. I upgraded my side of plain fries for the poutine and I'm glad that I did. I'm not poutine connoisseur (I may be French Canadian but I ain't no expert) and it was very tasty. You could either get the classic poutine (cheese curds, gravy and fries) or the Quebecoise (cheese curds, bacon, gravy and fries)   If the diner isn't busy, try to sit in the big comfy booths, they're perfect to people watch. And the fact that it's 24-hours is a nice alternative to the 24-hours McDonald's near by.   Overall, I'll give The Counter 3.5 for their good service (the staff were friendly and attentive) and their products (mmm, poutine...). So the only thing I need to say is: Welcome to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I just discovered this place near my apartment and I was incredibly excited as I love having something 24hr near me. However I was very disappointed. I waited over a half hour for takeout, which is fine I had my book with me. But when I asked when the food would be out the host seemed surprised that I hadn't gotten it yet, which was weird. So I immediately got my food, and asked if it would still be warm as it seemed to have been sitting there awhile. The host assured me that it would so I paid and went home. The food I received was a mess. The poutine was a combination of maybe 15 fries, a lot of bland gravy and a solid mass of cheese. and the mac and cheese was fine, but I needed to add my own salt as there was no flavour. I don't mind the wait, but if the food is always this disappointing, I'll pay for the TTC to 7 West."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday for what was intended as brunch but I saw fried chicken ($17.95 I think?) and couldn't resist. It was kinda brunchy since I got it with breakfast potatoes! My friend got the regular breakfast with 3 eggs, turkey sausage, home fries and toast ($12.95).   The fried chicken was lacking a bit of flavour to be honest. It wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't the best I've had (which currently is from parts and labour). There were 5 pieces - 3 drumsticks, a small thigh and half a breast. It came with ranch sauce that definitely helped give it some omph. The batter wasn't heavy but I think the chicken was just a tiiiiiiny bit over cooked cuz it didn't have the juices flowing out when I bit into it. The home fries were delicious though with little pieces of almost burnt onions.   My friends breakfast was probably the better meal. It said 3 eggs but it looked like 5. They were fluffy and not in little bits and pieces like other places do them. The turkey sausage was alright but I favour pork sausages more.   Side note: they have jam in these individual little jars that were so cute!  Overall I wouldn't be back for the fried chicken but if I happen to pass by and want breakfast I might drop in (they're open 24 hours with all day breakfast)."}
{"text":"Went to the diner on Friday and ordered the fried chicken. Was surprised to see an addition 3 Dollar charge for \"dark meat\" on the bill, even though I didn't specify a preference. When I asked the waiter about the charge, he told me that there is a 3 dollar charge for dark meat and a 5 dollar charge for white meat and since I didn't specify, he gave me the cheaper option. It's ridiculous to have a mandatory up charge on an item and no base option. 3 dollars isn't a big deal, but it seems like an attempt to take advantage of costumers. What does the $19.50 menu price get you? A basket of bones? When brought to the attention to the waiter, he was seemed annoyed that we questioned the charge and ended up leaving the table saying \"you're talking to the wrong guy.\" Super weird experience overall. Skip this place. Many other places nearby with better food and that don't try to gouge customers."}
{"text":"The Counter is an upscale diner and a very cool concept.  I've been here twice - once for an appetizer and a drink in a group, and another time for dinner with a friend.  The decor is nice and modern.  The staff seem a little stuffy in my opinion, but the service was fine on my second visit.  On the first visit though, the large table I was sitting at completely overwhelmed our server (even though we had a reservation for a large group) and everything was terribly slow.  The food, well, it certainly comes in large portions.  The artichoke dip was huge and pretty good.  The club sandwich that I had on my second visit was awful.  The only good thing about it was the generous amount of bacon that was on it.  The bread was cold and soggy, it was way too big to be eaten as a sandwich and just ended up being an awkward mess, and the chicken...well...I have never seen chicken like this.  It was some sort of spongy processed crap.  The cocktails are a little pricey at $12, and there are just a few of them.  I had a Counter variation on a mojito which was made with sparkling wine.  It sounded like a cool idea, but I didn't like it.  I'm not sure why - I love mojitos, I love sparkling wine - how could i go wrong?  The Counter, I'm sad to give you 2*.  I like the idea of you so much.  When I first heard about you from my friends, I thought you would be so awesome to know.  But now that we've hung out a bit, I realize you're just an average, boring guy in fancy clothes."}
{"text":"The Veggie Burger here was a bit different from what I'm normally used to - a homemade chick pea burger paired with a yogurt cucumber raita sauce.   This really should not be called a burger, it fails in both appearance and texture. I felt like I had a mouth full of hummus. That's not to say that this menu item can't be repurposed. Grill some veggies, use the chickpea  \"burger\" as a sandwich spread (less is more) and you've got yourselves a mean veggie sandwich.   Another tip - keep the raita sauce on the side or maybe consider another sauce altogether. Something as thin as yogurt is easily absorbed by the chickpea burger and the bun, leaving you with somewhat of a dry burger."}
{"text":"Good service, food and ambiance. Open 24hrs so the crowd can get a little rowdy but the servers were very friendly. Was given fries instead of salad so he gave me both instead. This place beats lakeview restaurant by a mile."}
{"text":"Came in with my boyfriend and sister cause we were craving some good food near Fort York. We ordered the Slow Roasted Lamb Shank, Butter Chicken (yes, there was butter chicken at the Thompson Diner), and the Mac and Cheese. When the food got to the table, we got a little impatient and dug in before I could snap the pics, but here they are."}
{"text":"the food is sub par on all accounts, i have tried this place many times and i am let down each and every time... add to it that on the weekends they make you wait outside in the freezing cold for a table along with all of the retarded clubbers makes this place a complete joke, its a sad testament to the lack of decent late night places in downtown toronto"}
{"text":"I food was tasty and the service was prompt.  The decore was typical for a \"diner\" but the prices were WAY out of line.  $6 for a tiny milkshake.  (The Menu said $7.50!)  For this price I was expecting it to be huge.  But it came in a typical glass that you get at other greasy-spoon type places for $3.25.  It was good, but in no way shape or form worth it.  The fish and chips were so over-battered the outside was crispy and delicious but getting closer to the fish it was a goupy uncooked mess.  The fries were decent.  Also consumed at my table was a Montreal Smoked meat sandwich.  The flavours were all excellent, but for $12.50 you would expect a boat-load of meat stuffed into the bread.  But alas it was only a few slices.  They are clearly trying to take advantage of the hotel customers AND as a last resort refuge for the club district people looking to eat something while they sober up before returning to their car and go \"danging driverously\" in a drunken stupor all the way home.  Would I return?  I might return to try a burger...  But for $12.50 there are better cheaper options only a couple blocks away.  $45 for 2 meals, 1 milkshake and 1 beer?  It should have been $30.  We didn't get any appys!  The food deserves more stars but at these prices I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"So my partner and I were looking for a place to have our outrageously late dinner (it was past midnight) and we decided to give the Thompson a try.   The decor is really nice. It has that retro style with a nice modern and hip touch. As soon as we entered, we were greeted and we were seated promptly. There is some TV's showing sport channels and some chill music in the backround. The lights are dimmed, making a very relax and cozy atmosphere.   Our server was very polite, attentive and made sure our drinks were always replenished on time.  Only thing; when he told my partner the type of potatoes he could get with his meal, my partner asked which ones he thought would compliment the dish the best. To which the server said ; \"It's only potatoes\". Not the best answer when you serve two foodies.   For night, the menu offers good variety and the prices are fine, given it's a more upscale setting.   I chose the Fried chicken with Jalapenos Waffles and syrup (3/5). The dish was well executed but it was lacking some syrup. It only covered half of the waffle. The waffle itself was delicious and so was the chicken. Portion was OK, regular size, but since it was in the \"Overly big mains dishes\" section, I was hoping for bigger.   Partner had the 3 way omelette, with house potatoes, asparagus and turkey sausage (4/5). Nicely presented, again the portion wasn't spectacular. Bread was good, it just lacked a little bit more of spice to get a perfect note.   Another thing we observed; it took an eternity to get served! 25 minutes. Enough for me to believe they were raising a chick, have it lay an egg for my partner's omelette, then kill it and make the chicken for my waffle. We were 8 patrons in the place! That's something they should work on. And something you should be aware of if you are in a hurry.   I would return, it's nice, conveniently located near were I live and good service and food. IF they can work on speediness and portions it will be even better."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Toronto! They have amazing milk shakes (alcoholic/non alcoholic) and great service! They're open 24/7 which makes it super convenient. I have yet to try something on the menu I didn't like. I recommend their poutine for sure! One of the only inconveniences I experienced was parking. Awesome retro exterior look. Once you step foot inside, the decor changes to a very modern look. Large booths plus tables accommodate parties of all sizes. They do have takeout for those in a rush to be in and out. You have to stop by this place if you're in Toronto!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to check out this place for brunch because we wanted to eat chicken & waffles! Little did I know, the Thompson diner is actually inside the Thompson Hotel and it is next door to another fancy restaurant that also serves brunch --  The grand Colette. When I entered through the hotel to get to the restaurant, it had a large red light sign, like a typical diner, but as soon as I stepped inside, it was very bright. I love that there are A LOT of windows for natural sunlight to shine through. Personally, Sunday brunch is best when there's a lot of sunlight. It makes my mood happier which in turns makes me enjoy the food more. If I had a choice, I would definitely choose the patio too. The restaurant has a lot of booth seats that can seat up to ~4-5 people comfortably. Overall, it felt like a modern twist to a traditional diner.   I ordered the St. Lawrence Sandwich with homefries ($12.45). It was basically fried egg, pea meal bacon, swiss cheese, toasted on a kaiser. It was delicious, but it wasn't anything special. The homefries were not too oily but still crispy enough. My friend ordered the buttermilk fried chicken & waffles ($17.95) and this was REALLY good. It had 3 pieces of fried chicken on a bacon & jalapeno waffle. I loved that the waffle wasn't just a plain o' kind, but it added something to make it more interesting. The texture was more on a soft side, which I didn't really like as I prefer it being more crispy, but my friend loved it. I guess it is a personal taste thing. I also had a small piece of the crispy chicken and it was delicious!! Not too oily and had lots of flavour. I didn't really like the chipotle mayo though because it had this distinct taste to it.  The service here was good. Our server was really nice and got us what we needed. However, when I asked to take home my unfinished food, it was very weird. Actually, I didn't like how he took care of it. He came with an empty box and immediately I thought I had to put the food in the container myself, but instead, he insisted to do it. I passed over my plate to him and he basically dumped everything in the box, as if it was garbage. First, I have never see a nice upscale-ish restaurant put unfinished food in the container IN FRONT of the customer and second, it is really NOT nice to pour everything into box like that. I had half of my sandwich left and a cup of homefries and it turned out to be a complete mess after he dumped everything into the container.. If he had to do that, I'd suggest he take my dish to do it without me looking. Hence the reason why I took a star off."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper at Thompson Diner.  They serve their beer in an old-school mugs.  Gord was craving Mac 'n Cheese, which is why we went there.  He ordered it with bacon and said it was good and would order it again.  I ordered Butter Chicken.  It was yummy and I'd get it again.  There were lots of chunks of chicken  Our server took goo care of us.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Thompson diner is really just a diner. Being in the lobby of a nice hotel kinda threw me off.   The food is typical diner food quality. Got a regular breakfast with eggs, sausage, home fries, toast. Was serviceable, but feel like something I could make at home myself."}
{"text":"Wow this is one of Toronto's hidden food gems for all things greasy and delicious. Was not busy on a Thursday. Friendly waiter with a cute bow tie. The portions at this diner are ginormous. Food is top notch well prepared and tasty. I was given three huge pieces of buttermilk fried chicken....nicely spiced and flavoured just right on a giant waffle with the right amount of maple syrup and spicy mayo. Everyone was blown away by the signature Mac and cheese dish: it was literally two portion sizes and my colleague had to take it home for dinner."}
{"text":"I only had two dishes here at 3am. I came here with some friends after a concert next door and had a reasonably good experience. The placed looked pretty upscale compared to similar restaurants and the service was really friendly.  The \"side\" dishes are, uh... pretty big. I can usually eat a lot of food, but finishing everything wasn't as easy as I expected.  The mac and cheese had a good amount of crunchy stuff on it but it wasn't particularly cheesy, more like... creamy? The poutine wasn't particularly good. Still better than Smokes though, I fucking hate Smokes."}
{"text":"While in Toronta, we were told this was a great scene and not to be missed.  We were at another hotel, but our concierge got us on the list for the rooftop bar and we headed over.  Upon arrival, the rooftop was closed, so we came downstairs and found the diner by accident.  We started off with the cheese plate:  it came with about 1/2 oz servings of 4 cheeses.  We were told it was Parmesan, Blue, a sheeps milk and \"not sure on that one\".  It wasn't parmesan, it was sometime of truffle infused sheep milk.  The \"unsure\" one was a jalapeño infused cheddar.  Besides the portions being so small, the cheese was all cold, as if the dish had just been pulled from the walk-in.  If you're going to offer a cheese plate, your kitchen should at least understand temperatures!  The Pork belly appetizer came in a small cast iron croc and was nice and crispy with a side bowl of an orange dipping sauce.  The porkbelly itself had no real flavor to it, I would suspect it wasn't braised, but instead just fried in the deep fryer.  The sauce though was excellent and brought some flavor to the pork belly.  The service was excellent.  Friendly staff, giving recommendations on where to go and what to do for the night.    The appetizer experience was disappointing that we didn't want to waste our only night in Toronoto with a bad dinner, so we left to have a full dinner somewhere else.  Great for drinks, not so much for the food..."}
{"text":"A group of us stopped by Thompson Diner for a quick late night bite last night before heading over to 1812 Lounge at Thompson Hotel.  The restaurant was large and did have an upper scale ambiance for a diner.  I just ordered the Mac and Cheese side to get me through the second round of drinking ahead of us.  The Mac and Cheese was served in a mini iron skillet, therefore obviously freshly made and it also made for nice presentation.  It was rich and creamy and I enjoyed it.  Definitely a great comfort food dish.  Portions for all our orders were generous and left us all satisfied.  I wouldn't hesitate to come back when I am not in a rush and try other menu items if in the mood for diner/comfort food in a casual restaurant."}
{"text":"C-Grade Food, C-Grade Service  Mid-week lunch, virtually empty except for a few small-party tables. ie the place was not busy. So uncertain why we had such an indifferent & inattentive waitress?   We ordered 3 dishes:  1) The Waffles were really good.  2) Puzzled why people rave about the Mac & Cheese? -- very bland.  3) As for the hot dog -- you can get better hotdogs at IKEA. Seriously. The bread was stale & inedible so it was basically an 'Atkins Diet Hotdog'.   Bad service can be (partly) forgiven by good food. And bad food can be (partly) forgiven by good service. Having neither -- well, that's pretty unforgivable.   This was meant to be a special family lunch for us, sadly it's 'special' for all the wrong reasons."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here on Sunday evening, the place is not busy and there server was very friendly. O ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, and my gf got the three cheese sandwich. First thing, the fried chicken was great, very crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, the dill dipping sauce was great with. It has a nice flavour and light spice to it. The cheesey mash potato was underwhelming, it was dry and the cheese was just a slice of cheddar cheese melt on top of it, I asked for gravy and it doesn't have any taste as well. Stay away from it, ask your server if you can sub it to other sides. The grill cheese was very good, very cheezey and delish, she had it with some sweet potato fries. It was good.  Overall, it was pretty, good chicken and grill cheese. Not so much for mass potato. Also the price is a bit high. That is why I took off 2 stars. They don't accept debt card so cash or credit card. Might visit again if in the area again."}
{"text":"It is rare to find a place open 24 hours in Toronto that isn't totally wretched, so in this sense it's a great spot.  I don't really know what's \"diner\" about it, it's basically a lowly lit Denny's with candles on the tables.  The food quality is about the same and the service is not good...it's very friendly, but they forget things and don't come around often, and don't fill water and other restaurant niceties.  I had the calamari appetizer (average), poutine (average), and cheesecake (quite good).  It it VERY LOUD in there when drunk selfish pricks come in from the bars and start screaming and partying in the place.  Trying to have a normal conversation became impossible and we had to leave.  So if you're out late and need some food then this may be one of the only places you can go, but I don't see any other reason to ever come here."}
{"text":"We went on New Year's Eve (last night) after the party we went to. Surprisingly there was no wait at 1:30 AM! My friend and I split a buttermilk chicken and waffles as well as a chocolate milkshake ($7). The milkshake was thick and delicious and worth it.   The chicken and waffles looked amazing and tasted average. More skin than meat on the chicken. The chipotle mayo was good. The waffle was average too.   Our friend ordered the Mac n Cheese and it was very rich tasting (truffle oil), large portion and very yummy/cheesy! We all helped her eat it.   Service: Prompt and pleasant. They were attentive in clearing our plates. They told us after we were seated that the wait was ~20 mins which wasn't bad given it was New Year's Eve. We didn't notice the wait as we were busy chatting.  Seating: Bonus that they have booth seating for up to 4 people.   Bathroom: Only 2 stalls. One toilet bowl was dirty (someone had been sick).   Line up: When we left at 2:45 AM ish there was quite a line, i.e. After the bars closed.   Although I only rated it 3 stars I would go back as it's a great location, open 24 hrs, and the service was good."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch the other day to catch up with some friends and had pretty decent BLT. The decor wasn't too fancy but was a bit nicer than your typical greasy spoon diner, and the booths are big and comfy. The service was a bit slow, but when my friend's order came out wrong they were very quick and accommodating in getting her the right food. I'll likely be coming back again to try out some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Do not allow the gaudy interior belie the excellent food and service. I was pleasantly surprised on a late holiday afternoon by a tasty meal of maple glazed salmon (and my partner, an omelette with a side of fried potatoes). The fish was cooked to the exacting level of tenderness and caramelization, sitting on top of a moist bed of quinoa. Three strands of grilled broccoli mediate the contrast, tasting of charcoal and woven in between. I don't remember the last time I devour my meal in such an awful hurry -- it was simply delicious!"}
{"text":"I use to come here every other week for their fantastic breakfast. However, ever since they change their menu I stop going there anymore. First they lower the portion of the breakfast (ie from 3 eggs to 2 eggs) and jacking up the price at the same time. Therefore I'm finding alternative restaurant since there are so many in downtown."}
{"text":"Since writing my first review, the Thompson Diner has switched management, or ownership... I don't know. Something switched.  I still like hitting this spot for what it is, although it should be noted that the prices have actually gone up: pancake breakfast for 2 with coffee + sparkling water amounted to over $60.00 . Sorry to say the pancakes weren't even very good... quite bad actually.  Staff are fairly accommodating with allergies, however do spout out the usual \"we can't guarantee...\" speech. *eye-roll"}
{"text":"Wow. Ordered the buttermilk fried chicken and boy....it was out of this world. The skin was crunchy, and when you bit into it, juices explode! My wife had the Mac and cheese, which was really unique and creative. This is about my 3rd time going. Th staff are very friendly aswell.  Strongly recommend for any meal, anytime of the day."}
{"text":"They get two stars because they're open 24 hours (convenient) and because I really, really like their milkshakes (seriously, pick one - chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, can't go wrong).   But the rest of the food is terrible (think tasteless, lacking in texture, not cooked properly, cold, etc.) and will take forever to get to you. The servers may tell you it's because the kitchen is busy, which I can understand if it's taking a long time, but that's no excuse for poorly executed food.  But their milkshakes are amazing, make sure you try one."}
{"text":"Looks great for a 24-hour joint. Their drink menu has $12 drinks and they're all 1.5 oz which seems a bit of a rip off compared to better restaurants that offer 2-3 oz. drinks for those prices.  Pub food at restaurant prices. I can see how I'd pay this if it was 3am but coming here during normal hours feels like a rip off.  Pastrami reuben sandwich was pretty good. The side salad was spring mix with a dressing that was way too vinegary for my liking. You could tell they used the cheapest balsamic available and lots of it. Gross.  Presentation is cute. Sandwiches come on a wooden plank/board. Fries and onion rings come in a mini deep fryer basket. Very cute.  Service was pretty slow considering we were one of 3 tables there (which should tell you something).  I'd come back after hours, but not during normal restaurant business hours. This place beats out Fran's and 7 West for a 24-hour joint but doesn't compare to other places during normal hours."}
{"text":"Not bad for a 24 hour breakfast place.   Service- 4/5 nice and friendly   Atmosphere- 4/5 clean, family oriented diner  Food- 3.5 chicken waffles are decent and good portion size."}
{"text":"I met my boyfriend on Queens Quay after work and headed up Bathurst towards King Street West. The Thompson Diner caught our eye. The lighting seemed cozy from the outside and we craved comfort food.   There was a parking lot across the street, which is refreshing for such a chaotic neighbourhood with tons of construction. This diner took us both away.   He had the West coast burger, which came on a wooden board with in a cute small fries basket on the side. The burger looked delicious with all the spinach, cheese, tomatoes, and more! It was such a large burger that he had to cut it up into bitesized pieces!  I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs. I have to make a correction n that you get a massive veal-and-pork meatball on top of the spaghetti  it was the perfect portion size. The dish was flavourful, with the right amount of cheese that complemented the fresh tomato sauce.   For dessert, we split the pecan pie. It was so buttery good. It is the best pecan pie that I have ever had. It came with vanilla bean ice cream.   The food is so good. I'd come back for the pecan pie alone! The setting is nice with booths everywhere. You can even sit at the bar and watch the game. I will definitely go back here. It made our date night even more memorable."}
{"text":"Had the all day breakfast - kind of bland but service was good. Atmosphere is fun though. Would come back cause it's close but not for the food."}
{"text":"If the food were as good as the service, this would easily be a 5-star restaurant. The staff were friendly, attentive and went well above what you'd normally expect at a diner (i.e. offering a newspaper with breakfast, putting my coffee in a to-go cup, asking how I wanted my poached eggs done... nobody ever does that!)  Unfortunately, the food was mediocre at best. Turkey sausages were dry and rubbery, potatoes were bland... we're talking the most basic breakfast here, nothing complicated, but they couldn't even get that right.   I might give it another go because they had some decent looking things on the menu, but then again, you only get one shot at breakfast a day. Every one should count."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast before starting my day.... Greeted by an extremely cheerful employee who seated us and said our server would join us shortly....The Diner is  very clean and upscale looking with reasonable pricing.... Server arrived and offered to get us drinks ie. water while we were deciding what we were having to eat... I ordered Atlantic Omelet with home fries and rye toast... Everything came quickly but was not very hot.... My partner in crime ordered a Canadian Omelet,home fries and whole wheat toast and his too was only warm... My omelet was overly salty as well....Not sure if I would order the same again or try something different should I go again...."}
{"text":"Not impressed, yet I'm not surprised either. Over priced food. The macaroni dish wasn't cold, and wasn't even cheesy. The highly recommended poutine wasn't that great either all you can taste is the hoisin sauce that made it so Asian and salty. Be more original! The diner itself was unique, had a hotel feel to it as well. I don't think I'll be back here. The service was eh. Didn't really serve me to be honest."}
{"text":"Came here late at night (1am on a Tuesday) for really late dinner with moro mou.  Love the decor, it's diner-y but much more posh than the average 1950s style places. Air conditioning was blasting way too high, brrr!  Waitress was excellent and put a lot of effort into trying to convince us to drink booze. This place has boozy milkshakes. Wow.   I had the chicken club sandwich with a side salad and moro mou tried a pastrami melt with fries. Large portions, especially mine. Chicken was real grilled chicken and there were probably 2 whole chicken breasts. Lotsa meat. Very fresh and tasty. Had to toss half the bread as it was overload.  Moro mou ate up his pastrami melt at lighting speed and said it was delicious.  Very cool place and bonus points for being 24 hours."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a hankering for waffles and this was the closest place. We've been back a few times since my last review, mainly because of the restaurant's proximity to us.   I really enjoyed my Fried Chicken and Waffles and even my Mocha. My husband was REALLY hungry and decided to order from their mains titled \"Oversized Way Too Big Mains\"...dear Thompson's Diner just because you say it's so doesn't make it so. I wish I took a picture but husband's Ravioli was ridiculously small. He ended up eating half of my dish plus his own and I don't blame him.  The quality and consistency has definitely improved but come on if you advertise \"Oversized Way Too Big Mains\"...they better be WAY TOO BIG (or at the very least filling)."}
{"text":"Me and a few friends ended up at this amazing little place ! We were not checked in or anything .... More like just passing by. I ordered the grilled cheese hamburger which was absolutely delicious .... My mouth is watering as I think about it :) the only thing stopping me from rating this place a full 5 stars is I got the matza ball soup . Now being a Jew and working for a jewish oriented restaurant ... I have had my fair share of a Beautiful chicken broth soup with the hand rolled soft matza  balls! Unfortunately when I ordered the soup The balls were hard and disgustingly small ... Like the size of marbles !! I sent that right back and fortunately the waiter knowing that I was also in the same industry took it off the bill! Now of course I got the macaroni appetizer which was absolutely amazing !!!!!!!! And that saved the night"}
{"text":"Wanted something quick and casual for a breakfast spot on a Saturday. The atmosphere is peaceful and and light. Although the menu doesn't have a ton of options, what they do have is done well.   Even if the food sucked, the service is what really did earn the five stars. Three patrons came quite still drunk from the night before and continued to drink at 9am.   They were loud and so disruptive. And when they started making ridiculous requests like 5 Lemons in water and a grilled cheese at 9am, the staff were patient and kind to us and the other patrons trying to enjoy their morning.   Our server and their server Sarah was simply amazing. Not only did she stand patiently while three of their cards were declined, she shook off the difficult table with every turn and gave us such attentive care. The manager, didn't catch her name also did an amazing job of stopping them from being disruptive. The bus boy also was just wonderful in keeping calm and not projecting the awful table to other people. I commend all of the staff for just doing a wonderful job."}
{"text":"Take-out order for starving drunks in 15 mins flat! This will be my new go-to for late night eats. Ordered burger/fries and mac and cheese w/bacon. Everything was good, the mac and cheese especially. Sat at the bar whole we waited for our food to be done and the bartenders and waiters were awesome, very friendly and chatted with us till our food was ready."}
{"text":"OK - I review this place because I love going there. I love that it is 24/7.  I love that it is amidst King West and actually in the ritzy Thompson hotel, yet reasonable, chill and you don't have to be dressed to the 9s to feel very comfy there. Foodwise - it is a basic, but good, menu.  I've always liked the towering grilled chicken club.  The truffle oil 4 cheese mac n cheese is a delight coming out on a hot skillet.  Burgers are pretty hearty.  Salmon is so so, a little dry. Salads are all big n fresh. Go here either in the middle of a weekend night, or lounge all Sunday afternoon and catch a game on the TVs. Love having this in the hood!"}
{"text":"Oops I did it again. Once again I made the mistake of eating here as it is so convenient for me. As usual, I left without eating most of what was served to me. Even the butter package was warm and almost liquid. Yet again I ordered the $4 glass of grapefruit juice. This is not juice. When I asked the waitress about it she told me it was grapefruit cocktail. Next came a super dry omelette. It was terrible and so were the oily and soggy home fries.  This place is rubbish. Like how hard is it to make an omlette? I fail to understand why Thompson Toronto is several notches below their other properties. The place is so filthy with dirty windows and the frontage is covered with cigarette butts. Avoid this bush league operation at all costs, it really sucks balls."}
{"text":"I just had the most amazing Threesome.... Cheese Threesome that is!  Drinking Beer ALL DAY can make you... well....DRUNK and we needed to sober up before going to a friend's art show.  We saw The Counter while on the Bathurst streetcar and decided to give it a try despite the mixed reviews.   This place is basically an upscale 24-hour dinner attached to the Thompson Hotel. Prices are a little higher than most dinners but the portions are huge! I ordered the Cheese Threesome and it was incredible. The tempura onion rings were insanely tasty and the service was impeccable.  Hubby and I both ate dinner, were stuffed and the bill came to $36 including tax and tip (we had water to drink... we had enough beer).  Definitely a great place and I'll be back... a little more sober next time!"}
{"text":"Crappy crappy crappy. Don't waste your money here.  We had the veggie burger and the mac and cheese. The veggie burger was bland and had a mushy, undesirable texture. The mac and cheese was also extremely bland and only had a hint of flavour at the top with the cheese. The sweet potato fries were decent, but nothing special. Also, the service was crappy- our server was rude and unhelpful. Food is overpriced, too.   Again: don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"I popped in here twice a couple weeks ago- I admit I'm a huge sucker for '50s decor.  The first time, I ordered the blueberry pancakes. At first, I thought $12.50 was really steep for three pancakes, but as soon as I saw the plate, I was proven wrong. What I wasn't expecting were three pancakes each the size of a small pizza, chock full of real blueberries with more on top. They also came with real maple syrup, which is a necessity. This is Canada- we deserve better than table syrup! I was really hungry when I came in, but only managed to finish less than half.  The second time, I had the club sandwich, and to be honest, I wan't all that impressed. It was huge, and packed full of real chicken, but I found the bread to be overpoweringly thick, and the chicken to be slightly underdone and rubbery, and with too much store or Sysco-bought seasoning. The side Caesar was also somewhat bland and overdressed.  Top marks for breakfast, solidly middle for lunch and later.  The place also has cool decor, quick service and is very clean, always a plus. More of a 3.5 than a true 3."}
{"text":"Comfort food done right. Nothing fancy, never disappoints unless they're sold out of something. Fantastic Mac N' Cheese, solid burgers, crack-level addictive chicken fingers and a very \"Toronto\" atmosphere of oddity as it's open 24 hours. Not the healthiest choice but definitely the right choice."}
{"text":"Great place for a midnight snack. Had the 550 chicken club.  It was good as it looked.   How can  you not go if your in the area.  It a great 24 hour diner. One of the best in the city."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a greasy spoon diner that opens early and closes late, Thompson Diner does not disappoint. Even they no longer opens 24 hours but from 6 am to 3 am, that's pretty good business hour for me.  Lunch on a weekday is relative quiet. Our waiter is friendly and attentive. Price is fair for the food and location. This is though diner style but we are talking at one in Downtown Toronto in a Boutique hotel.  Thompson Burger ($16) was tasty and juicy. Cooked with a hint of pink. The star though was the 12 Hours BBQ Beans! Who can say no to those braised pork belly chunks hiding in that innocent looking beans....  Reuben's Happy Place ($16) was so so. The short rib pastrami was hard and dry. We were told this was the \"last\" Rueben sandwich for the day. Hmmm, that kind of explained that we got the end pieces. I did enjoy the taste profile.  Ontario Sour Cherry Pie ($8) from Wanda's Pie in the Sky has a nice butter crust and the perfect tartness from the cherry. The scoop of ice cream for $3 can be a little bigger."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place, and can I just say, it lives up to the hype. Came here for dinner on a Friday around 8:30 PM. It wasn't too busy, and my group of three had no problem getting seated right away. Based on other Yelp reviews and tips, we tried the double mac n' cheese and the buttermilk chicken. The mac n' cheese was delicious, super cheesy and made with truffle oil! We just got it plain, but I'm thinking it might taste even better with bacon in it. We also got the buttermilk fried chicken, which was great because the chicken was super super soft and juicy. The cheddar mashed potatoes that came with them though were just mediocre, and tasted like they could have come out of a box, so that was probably the only downer during our dinner. I thought the service was alright, not particularly fantastic, but nothing to complain about either. While I don't think I would make a trip out here especially for this place, I would not mind coming again if I was in the area!"}
{"text":"Great food bad service. Eggs Benedict was pretty blah wouldn't recommend it. Took us almost an hour to get our food but the manager brought over some fruit. Would have to repeatedly ask for things. Barely saw our waitress. Even our drinks took forever/never came."}
{"text":"Honestly?  Who are we kidding.   When a high-profile, boutique hotel opens up in the neighbourhood, everyone was expecting class, good food and great service.   I went to The Counter for brunch when they first opened, and was shocked at the lack of professionalism, promptness and overall demeanour of the staff.   Pieces of the order had been forgotten.   It was a mess.   Haven't gone back - and I don't think that I will.   Oh, the food? Mediocre."}
{"text":"I went here at 5am, because I couldn't sleep and needed a hearty breakfast before heading north for some snowboarding later in the morning, and Mars Diner wasn't open that morning (they are only open 24 hours on the weekends).  The restaurant is very nice inside. A sort of retro luxe diner vibe going on, with a cool mix of jazz/blues/motown music playing in the background. Eventhough I was the only customer at the restaurant and there was a staff of dozen in attendance, the service was very spotty and unattentive.  Only the breakfast menu was available at the time I was there, which was perfectly fine and I love breakfast anytime of day or night. Being a benny lover I ordered the eggs benedict, which at $12 I thought it was very reasonable. The food arrived fast and why wouldn't it be as they were not exactly busy.  The food was presented nicely on a cast iron skillet, however the skillet was just decorative as it wasn't even hot. The wooden tray that held the skillet was warped so the whole skillet wobbled annoyingly when I dug into the food.  The portion was rather small, and the benedict was extremely bland and boring, as were the roasted potatoes. The caramelized onions were the only nice component on the dish, and I tried to spread the onions over every portion of eggs and potatoes. For being such a mediocre dish with no flavor and being a smallish portion, $12 was actually overpriced for what it is.  The coffee was good, but not $3 good. I would rather head over to Jimmy's a block away for cup of their awesome coffee for much less.  I was disappointed that my waitor was not very attentive during my meal. I had to flag one of the staff's attention to get his attention so I could get a refill of coffee. They were all chatting with each other, which is perfectly fine at this time of day and lacking any customers, but they could at least check up at my table every so often. The waitor was apologetic, but later on he simply disappeared when I wanted to get my check.  The three flat screen TVs above the bar and the cleaning lady moping the floors kept me entertained as I waited for my waitor to show up. I eventually had to walk into the kitchen to get a staff member to get my check.  My meal came to $15, which normally is a reasonable amount for a good breakfast. But for the poor service, boring food, and measley portions it's overpriced, and I was kicking myself for leaving a $3 tip, as I should've left a 10% tip, but I didn't have any change."}
{"text":"Came to Thompson for some great eats and boy was it packed!... was pretty surprised to see there was a lineup that took us about 15mins to get seated, but was well worth it.  Got the chicken waffles which I, at first, didn't think much of... but ended up being amazingly good.  The chicken was crisp yet tender, coupling it with the Siriracha (or maybe it was chipotle) mayo was the best thing ever. The syrup was more liquidy and runny than your Aunt Jemimah's but I liked it since it prevented it from overpowering the waffles (not much of a sweets person anyway). They put herbs in the syrup which I thought was a nice touch, and gave the waffles uniqueness."}
{"text":"We went here on Thursday after a conference. I don't know what anyone else said about slow service, we got our food fairly quickly. He got the chicken burger and a vanilla milkshake. I had the turkey burger and two glasses of cab sauv.   It was good diner food, no complaints."}
{"text":"I returned to find that The Counter is no longer and the Thompson Diner stands in its place. The difference? Not a thing. The restaurant looks, feels and definitely tastes the same as before, though I can safely say my experience was a bit better than last time.  My and my late date needed a place to grab a midnight snack and settle down with some homework. The menu items are largely unchanged; greasy diner food with a bit of an upscale twist. We decided to share the grilled cheese burger ($16) a burger squeezed between two gooey grilled cheese sandwiches. When we asked if it was shareable, our server confirmed with a vehemence that suggested that this thing was monstrously large.  It is humongo. No one person should eat it in one sitting. Even half a serving put a stranglehold on my arteries. But damn, it was tasty.  After the sandwich, we went full nerd and cracked upon our laptops. Though there isn't free Wi-Fi here, it's still a OK place to get some work done in the wee hours of then night."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm surprised this place has three stars, never judge a rate by its cover lol   It was honestly so good and the food was to die for. I GOT THEIR AMAZING MAC AND CHEESE. I couldn't resist, I ate the whole thing haha...you must try it!! It was affordable and the service was great."}
{"text":"I guess you can't really expect much from a 24hr diner.. a buddy and I were really hungry after a night of partying, so around 1:30am or so we went here. Big mistake. Although the service was pretty decent, the food wasn't. Their so called \"best in Toronto\" duck poutine was the nastiest thing my uvula has ever grazed. And it costed almost 20 freaking dollars!! The sandwich was bland. The only thing that was remotely average was the shake... and of course it was thick as hell too. I'd recommend going to Frans if you're looking for a place opened 24 hrs. (Frans review coming soon lol)"}
{"text":"The food at this place looked great and tasted even better! Absolutely worth going and is open 24 hrs. The St.Lawerence sandwich was delicious and will definately go back for another some day soon. Eat well friends!"}
{"text":"First timers in Canada, and the Thompson Diner was on our \"must eat here\" dining experiences.   The restaurant was full, but not overcrowded, so we were seated almost immediately and this was followed with quick service from our waitress.  I had the Huevos Rancheros and I'm drooling just writing this review. It was the perfect size, sometimes this dish can be quite monstrous, but I finished every last bite! Bae had the buttermilk pancakes with sides of bacon and eggs....his breakfast was massive! It came out on 2 plates, so if you're in the mood for 8\" pancakes order up.   The highlight for me was the $5 mimosas!!!! Thank ya!   Based off of our experience at the diner, we're definite going to check out the hotel on our next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"This is that one place that never ceases to amaze. The food is good. And I mean really really good. My go-to is chicken and waffles"}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff are nice and friendly, they're good tastes great and they have a very retro style dinner! If I had to pick a single item on their menu as a recommendation, it would be their grilled cheeseburger. It's gigantic and delicious!"}
{"text":"Outstanding mac and cheese, spectacular club sandwich, awesomely quick and professional service, +++++++ the music kicked ass as well!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place, and overall I don't hate it.  I was lured in by a hungry gnawing belly and had an event in the adjacent hotel to attend, and when I saw the menu the Peking Duck poutine looked interesting.  I like Peking Duck. I like poutine.  However I was disappointed ultimately by the soggy, gravy drenched duck. The skin no longer crispy. Maybe the bigger issue is one should just not mess around with poutine.   The staff were friendly and attentive and the view of Bathurst was entertaining, though if I were in the area again if probably just grab wings across the street at the \"oldest pub in Toronto\" ... the Wheat Sheaf. This might be a good breakfast/brunch option though."}
{"text":"Stopped in late one evening for poutine and was pleasantly surprised at the quality and presentation - I chose their Poutine Quebecoise, which was served with Montreal smoked meat and did not disappoint!  The one brilliant thing about the dish is that the poutine is served in a bowl that's oven hot, which serves to both melt the cheese and keep everything warm for 20+ minutes.  I'd recommend this as a solid competitor to any of the walk-in poutine places in the area, and I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Today was my fifth and last time.  I live close so I keep trying but never again.  Every time it disappoints.  Today I had a mushroom and cheese burger (simple, right?) and if there was one mushroom on it I would be amazed.  Burger was burned, bun was greasy, fries were from the bottom of the barrel...oil soaked, limp and cold.  IT's only redeeming quality was that it was open on New Years day and is open 24hrs...I guess if it's 3am and you're really hammered but would be OK....but even then...."}
{"text":"Turkey never had it this good.  I actually didn't even spot this place right across the street to the hot yoga studio I frequent until my cousin started joining me and suggested we try it out (lured like moths to its neon lighted signs).  Walking by the joint, I wasn't entirely sure I could trust the \"24 hours\" sign posted outside as fact or fiction because of how dark the place actually is.  To me, the place seems like a diner out of a Tim Burton movie, complete with \"beetlejuiced\" black and white drab on the wait staff.  Seating is ample with a good selection of booths on either end of the space, with larger U shaped booths for bigger parties.  Service was friendly, but a bit on the slower side.  Though I appreciate the time taken to make a dish to order than having things dry out on hot plates.  Kudos on its Ramsay approach ;)  The first time (yes, I've been back several times since), I'm thankful the waitress piped up her suggestion of ordering the turkey burger.  In her own words \"I honestly think it's better than the beef\".  At this, my cousin and I scoffed and needed to prove it to ourselves that mere poultry could outshine (let alone come close to) beef in the battle of burger.  Another upper-hand at this joint is that not only do you have a choice of meat (beef/turkey/veggie), but also a choice of signature toppings.  I've had tried almost all of them, but I have to say that the best combo is probably the West Coast (spinach, jalapeno jack cheese and crisp onions) or Deep South (pulled pork and crisp onions).  The thing that blew me away after taking the first bite is how incredibly tender and juicy the turkey was.  I kid you not as to how delicious this burger is and challenge you to find me a better turkey burger.  And serving this up with a side of either the Mac & Cheese (w/ cured pancetta crisp & truffle oil) or their huge battered onion rings, there are few better things worthy of retoxifying my system after a good 75 minutes of hot sweaty detox.    Here's a huge PostScript - a word to the wise about not breaking what ain't broken.  Do not, under any circumstance, order the beef.  It's impeccably dry and quite terribly bland - even with the toppings there was little to salvage that poor performance of a patty.  If you're in the market for beef - check my post about Burger's Priest"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Service was ok. Food was terrible. The Turkey Panini was one of the blandest, saddest sandwiches I've ever tasted. Onion rings were dry and fried to death. Friends pasta and meatballs was ok, nothing special."}
