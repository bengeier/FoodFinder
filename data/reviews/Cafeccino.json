{"text":"Really, really good coffee and espresso. They do an amazing job with the iced lattes and the red eye is a superb pick-me-up any time of the day.  The food is also quite tasty. The chicken salad is a refreshing treat with grapes, I highly suggest it. The breakfast sandwiches are also quite delectable. Fresh, buttery croissants and the option of throwing an egg and/or bacon on top.  I love the atmosphere. An eclectic mix. Always full of busy looking university students and important-seeming folks from the HR and finance companies up the street.   All of this comes together with comfortable shared work-spaces and private seating/tables (indoors and outdoors.)"}
{"text":"My husband and I went today for some breakfast. The decor is really cute, with lots of comfy couches.  I liked their cappucino, foamy and not super milky. As for breakfast itself, my husbands croissant breakfast sandwich was very good, with some fresh fruit on the side.   I got the belgium waffle combo and it was ok. The eggs are kinda like the flat patty's that come on fast food sandwiches, and a bit tough. The hash browns were a bit odd, like one solid mass. The waffles were good though. Overall my dish was OK. I understand they probably don't have a dedicated kitchen, since it's a cafe. I saw another customer eating the crepes though and I would definitely return to try it.  Lastly, they had various flavors of macaroons and they were perfect! I would totally recommend those."}
{"text":"Now this is what a local coffee shop be. Well stocked, great service, great coffee, board games, beer, good music. Love it. Nice job!!"}
{"text":"Their customer service is always on point. Each time I come in, no matter the person it is behind the counter ... They are super friendly and helpful! I always feel like I'm a valued customer coming and going from their establishment.   I come here specifically for the chai lattes, which are always perfect and kind of my addiction. On suggestion from the barista I started trying the different flavors, vanilla is my favorite, but the others are just as good like the cheesecake. They have a decent amount to choose from. Literally the best chai I've gotten in town.   My boyfriend likes their smoothies and says their bacon egg and cheese croissant was good (I didn't quite agree, but to each their own I guess). Not really into the food there, but I don't generally go looking for a meal at a coffee shop... So....  Overall I enjoy this place, and I'll soon venture and try more of their menu (hopefully!) lol."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here! I also love that they also have beer and wine and food and snacks, so it's basically a great place to hang out any time of day. Or for any mood that you're in!  Very nice back patio as well!"}
{"text":"The coffee and other drinks have been good, especially the Cheesecake Chai. Thst's a plus. The regular drinks here are the medium size in \"other\" coffee houses. That's a plus. The prices are extremely competitive.  That's a plus.  The employees are friendly and bring your order out to you.  That's a plus. The atmosphere is cozy with a good selection of seating. That's a plus.  The music is soothing and the volume is tolerable and conducive for \"conversation and concentration.\" That's a plus.  WiFi is reliable and fast.  That's  a plus. The owner is extremely involved, present and vested in the stores success. That is DEFINITLY a PLUS. The environment is culturally and ethnically diverse which truly reflects the community and what makes the University Area a great place to live, work and play.  PLUS, PLUS, PLUS!   Regarding the food, the pastries are fresh, good quality and  'delish'. They are now serving  breakfast all day. I sampled it for the first time today with an \"egg, bacon and cheese croissant. \"  The cheese was noticibly missing and the sandwich just ok. Will try another breakfast item again soon for an official review. I know it's a goal here to be recognized as a neighborhood café vs. a typical commercial coffee shop. They are well on the way!"}
{"text":"Nice place, but out of the 4 times I have been there I was unable to get what I ordered,  no eggs, no tomatoes , the lettuce was bad or simply out....smh"}
{"text":"Great coffee, atmosphere, and staff, but terrible hot breakfasts. They served us soggy microwaved waffles and bland hash browns. The eggs, toast, and bacon were just barely average.  Also, beware of the Groupon deal of two hot breakfasts for $13. They claim the Groupon has a $22 value, but each breakfast is listed as $7.49 on the menu for a total of $15. Thus you save $2 by buying the Groupon, not $9."}
{"text":"Awesome spot to start your day!  Coffee was excellent and food was great too!  Love the atmosphere!  Perfect little coffee shop!"}
{"text":"The coffee is clearly the Best in Charlotte. the atmosphere is VIP. the location is perfect for everyone, from students to professionals and Grandparents that wants to spend days with grandkids in a nice space in this fall season. The food is based on original menu so different from generic foods."}
{"text":"Went there a few months ago.  Had to ask several times for one of our breakfasts.  It finally came as the rest of us finished. For was ok.  Today, gave it another try.  Had to ask 3 times for one of our drinks.  Food was horrible. Will never go back.  I'd rate 0 if it was possible."}
{"text":"Not sure why this group is in the food business.  Normally I try to be kind because most people are at least trying. Eggs called scrambled but were a flat overcooked folded pancake. French toast seems like a frozen waffle soaked in eggs. Delivered with Karo syrup.  Traditional coffee not so great. Go for the relaxed atmosphere and maybe the espresso drinks if those are good.  But not for breakfast if you are hungry."}
{"text":"The baristas are great. Good customer service is always appreciated. Especially theses days."}
{"text":"All of their drinks are absolutely delicious, and just recently I have found out their waffles are also amazing as well. I would say though that their tea does not taste as their title states, but they're not bad. A very low key atmosphere, great place to spend time."}
{"text":"Love this place, one of my favorite places to grab some good coffee and chill with a book.  Soak up the atmosphere and enjoy unwinding.  Drinks, coffees, and desserts are excellent.  The décor is very welcoming with excellent seating and places to lounge.   Only \"complaint\" would be some of the food items.  I know it isn't a kitchen or a dinner so as long as you know that going in, you won't be disappointed, but content with the food."}
{"text":"This is one of the best if not the best coffee haven in Charlotte. The atmosphere is terrific the product is fabulous the people are awesome and now I have a great rewards program on top of everything else"}
{"text":"Super slow. We sat here for over 30 minutes waiting on a breakfast sandwich and waffles to go. Coffee was weak, even with an extra shot of expresso. Cute place but not worth the money. We paid $30 for breakfast and it was not worth the money. Also, workers are nice but. It professional at all. Probably won't come back here.  UPDATE: took almost an hour for our food. When we got it he handed it to me sideways so all the food got mixed up. I did not get any syrup for my waffles, which were soggy and gross. Fruit only had bananas and strawberries. Coffee was gross, watered down, and too sweet. Hash browns were burned black."}
{"text":"Wtf is this???? Warm egg cooked hours ago and just placed on a warm croissant layered with unmelted cheese, really?  ... we prepaid and was so disappointed we just left the food and went to Cracker Barrel Concord. The value does NOT match the QUALITY. $19.10 was a waste of money!"}
{"text":"While I typically go to Starbucks since it's just closer to where I live, I have been here a few times and love the quality and strength of their drinks. The coffee tastes superb and the baristas have all been friendly each time I have been. I actually like the atmosphere compared to someone else who posted otherwise. I feel like I am at home and not in some corporate coffee shop when there. They also do bring your drink to you if you have settled in and started reading or working on something so that's a nice little luxury for a coffee shop. It's locally owned and operated so I like that too. Give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Coffee is really good and they have unique flavors of lattes such as marshmallow and cheesecake. The employees are very nice as well."}
{"text":"This is probably the best coffee shop in the University area. Granted it is also one of the only coffee shops in this area (that isn't a chain). The thing I enjoy the most about Cafeccino's is the atmosphere: chill, relaxing, pretty steady traffic flow, yet never overwhelmingly crowded. The coffee isn't bad (but would enjoy a bigger variety to pick from).  I take a slight issue with the employees, though. I do recognize and appreciate how friendly they are, but sometimes feels a little too chill (boarding unprofessional). They do favor their regulars, and it shows. Sometimes I don't feel overly welcome there. On several occasions I've waited for simple drink orders (i.e. hot tea or drip coffee) close to 10 minutes (while they weren't busy) or my coffee would be lukewarm.   Overall, I do like this coffee shop! I just wish I felt a little more welcome there."}
{"text":"Hopefully this will be one of the only negative reviews I ever leave. I also hope this was a fluke seeing as how most reviews of this place are positive. But this was one of the worst customer experiences I've ever had in a coffee shop. I can't even tell you if the drinks are good here because I never actually got mine.   I was in the area for a parent thing at our son's preschool and we wanted some coffee since we were 15 minutes early. Meeting at 7, I walked in at like 6:47. There was 1 person ahead of me and plenty of people already seated. It *looks* amazing. I ordered a spicy Mayan mocha for myself and a vanilla frappe for my husband (because he told me simple syrup wasn't an option when I asked but then I saw a bottle labeled \"simple\" on the bar where the cream & sugar was kept). $9.98, I hand him a $10, drop my change & a $1 in the tip jar and proceeded to wait....  My order was handed off by my cashier to a lone barista. The cashier disappeared to the back for like ten minutes. Maybe longer IDK. The barista was working his tail off the whole time making a 3 drink order for the girl who had been ahead of me. He eventually sees me standing there and asked me if I had been helped yet. I said yes and he asked if I was the next order.  A few minutes later the girl ahead of me got her drinks and the barista said \"now we can start on yours.\" I was like, I'm really sorry but I am now late to my meeting and I don't have time to wait any longer if you guys haven't even started on my drinks. I didn't expect them to be finished but I would have thought they'd have at least had them partially on the way by now. I asked for my money back. The cashier had reappeared and took the receipt and counted me back my change... $9.98... Instead of just handing me back my $10, which though 2 cents in my favor, would have spared me the additional 45 seconds it took him to count five bills and 98 cents in coins. The barista was clearly mortified and apologizing. I felt awful but I was really late now. I had to go.   I walked out and got in the car and the clock read 7:08, 21 minutes elapsed. I ended up being 15 minutes late to my meeting, missing a chunk of important info, and no coffee, and really kicking myself that we blew our early arrival in such a spectacularly stupid and fruitless way.   I will try this place again because it really looked interesting but good grief that cashier needs to learn to help his coworker because there's seriously no excuse for 2 employees being unable to make 5 drinks in 15 minutes."}
{"text":"The chai lattes are really good. I love the ambiance of the place. When I imagine a small town coffee shop, this is what I think of, so the vibe is great.  I've been here twice and the second time we had an issue with the online ordering and won't be ordering that way again in the future, but the person that handled the issue genuinely seemed sorry for the mishap (even though it wasn't their fault).  Overall, great chai, great vibes and great service so we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm a little bit of a coffee shop snob coming from Portland, OR, where they have local coffee shops by the numbers. However, this is a really cute place and rather large. It's great for those who work from home or need a portable office workplace. They have larger tables, comfy chairs, and an overall great productive atmosphere. They have neat riddles by the register where you can save 10 cents if you answer correctly. They also have a cozy fireplace and board games available for play. I'm curious to taste their waffles and crepes, so maybe next time. Today, I just got a small iced coffee - they offer light and dark. I went with dark and it was pretty tasty.  UPDATE: I'm lowering my review to 3/3.5 stars. There was some construction work being done inside the coffee shop. I understand that this stuff happens and it may turn out to be louder than expected (which it did), but it made the atmosphere very loud, non-productive and unappealing. Some of this is out of their control, but I think they should have offered something to the guests who were in here working - perhaps a coupon or free treat or something. Some employees did apologize, which was nice, but as a first timer here, this did taint my view. The wireless was also not very good and went out 2-3 times while I was working. Also, there were no paper towels in the bathroom. C'mon, that's an obvious one.."}
{"text":"Gave this new coffee house a try --- and I'm glad I did. They just opened 5 days ago, so they're pretty new to the game. I went about 8:30 with a couple people and we ordered a total of 4 beverages and a breakfast sandwich. I think they're still in a little bit of a learning curve as far as drinks and timing goes, because it did take a bit longer than normal for the drinks to get made BUT- they were delicious! There are about 10 flavor options (including cheesecake, ftw) to add to your drinks. I got the iced vanilla chai latte, and it was AWESOME. Very sweet and creamy, and not too spicy like a lot of the other 'big' coffee places in CLT. A definite must try if you're in the area.  Side note: they also serve tons of breakfast items. Sandwich, waffles ... even a breakfast sandwich ON a waffle #hangoverheaven.   Located inside The Cedar Street Design Center: the building next to Draught, closer to Morehead."}
{"text":"An unobtrusive coffee shop in a grocery store shopping center near a few office parks.   I found this in my mad dash to find caffeine one rainy winter morning, and it was fine. I ordered a 16 oz. chai tea (brewed with a tea bag, not made with syrup like a chai tea latte), and though I was the only person still in the store it took the two staff members a good 5 minutes to fix my drink. Apparently the problem was that they add 2 tea bags to your 16 oz. drink, which seems unnecessary and caused problems because they only had 1 chai tea bag in house. When I realized the problem, I told them I could survive with just 1 tea bag in my drink, and I finally got my bev. Then I wanted skim milk in my chai, which is apparently unprecedented, because they didn't have any out in the beverage doctoring station. But props to the employee for pouring some of their gallon of skim directly into my cup -- he went the extra mile to make sure I didn't ingest any unnecessary calories, and I appreciated it.  Another point: it feels like the store's owners couldn't decide whether they wanted to be a fancy chain or a local joint. The decor is a mix of professionally printed signs (chain) and comfy chairs (local), the coffee drinks are more chainy, and their other offerings are more local. This place just seems to be lacking an identity. Pick an angle and go with it!"}
{"text":"I always support local businesses, especially local coffee shops. I tried the Irish Moon Latte and it was excellent.   Service was very fast and friendly. I'd you are tired of the same old Starbucks and Dunken's, I. Would most definitely check this place out if you are in the university are."}
{"text":"Really friendly and professional staff.  Really good coffee. The atmosphere is nice and hip with nice vibe. Very relaxing. Really enjoyed it. Thanks ya'll."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in to grab a bite to eat. The employees were sweet as pie and very very friendly. The helps us and we're patience as we decided what we wanted to eat!  I order the chicken salad sandwich. I will be honest it have not a lick of flavor. It came with fruit, which was very nice. Overall though the sandwich wasn't all that great. I won't order it again. I also had a chi latte which was very good. It's my guess there drinks are great but the menu is 2 out of 5. If you want a good drink, something hot to sip on. Stop by. But if you want food. I would suggest you try another spot."}
{"text":"Chill atmosphere. Not so much selection drink wise but overall a good place ro meet a friend or job search."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot near UNC and Concord Mills. Nice neighborhood. Nice cafe. The food was wonderful! We ordered croissant sandwiches, fruit crepes, and lattes. Everything was delicious but the crepes were probably the favorite. Highly recommend this breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"In a hunt to reward my sweet tooth, I ran across a new addition to downtown. We can never have too much coffee, but this new location also offers Macaroon's. They have a host of preprepared goodies. Can't wait to return for an iced latte."}
{"text":"I went back again and this time I really enjoyed everything! I had the crepes again and they were perfect. I had a cappuccino and loved it. And the next day I had waffles and loved it (and I'm not even a waffle person!)"}
{"text":"Cute coffee and breakfast shop!DEFINITELY recommend and will be back!  Staff is SUPER friendly and accommodating!  Large portions!   The Belgian waffle combo was super yummy with perfectly cooked eggs and bacon! The hash towns were more of a hasbrown pancake but still were yummy."}
{"text":"Nice Indy coffee shop with a flair for crepes. It's kinda comfortable and kinda not. For example the chairs are wider than the tables so you can't scoot your legs beneath the table. They do silly things like give paper cups for \"drink ins,\" so no high marks for saving paper resources. I haven't had the espresso. The lattes are fine and some baristas are skilled at latte art."}
{"text":"I'm a little torn on how to write this review because I feel there are so many different elements to the final score. Really, I'd give this place 3.5 stars but I can't round it up to 4 stars because I was kind of disappointed.   Let me break it down:  Service: 5 stars! Everyone from the young lady at the register to the young man who brought out our food gave us great service. Really friendly and professional.  Food: 3 Stars. Except for the waffle and the fresh fruit, nothing really stuck out. My hubby ordered a bagel with ham, bacon and swiss cheese. He got American cheese instead, which is fine, but it was such a scrawny looking bagel-1-egg, 1 slice of ham, 2 strips of bacon and 1 slice of the wrong cheese. Its sounds like a decent amount but it was just meager.     My turkey sausage patty was of the frozen bought variety and the eggs tasted as if they were cooked on a grill that wasn't necessarily properly cleaned in between cooking. Meaning my eggs looked and tasted of having been cooked on the same grill where the sausage was cooked. Not a biggie but this is something I would do at home in my own skillet; not something I'd expect of a business.  We both ordered tea with breakfast so I can't speak for their coffee skills but there were no milk alternatives to pour in my tea (although they do have almond milk for lattes). They also only had run of the mill, high fructose corn syrup pancake syrup for the waffles, no maple syrup.   I guess I just felt that, for being such a cute, cozy, trendy coffee shop, they would be a but more hip to the healthy stuff?! Maybe i'm just nuts.  Ambience-very study friendly with tables, chairs and outlets to come and hangout while enjoying a tea, coffee or some food. Music was good and at a decent volume. They also had plenty of board games to choose from. However, they had some merchandise just out in the open that made the place look less than neat. Stacks of soda and water bottles, cleaning buckets and just random items that belong in storage or in a closet but not in an area where clients can see.   Overall, really cute place to get a warm beverage (or cold beer) and chill out for a while. I just wouldn't necessarily recommend purposefully going there to eat; at least not breakfast. Will have to try again and report back."}
{"text":"This place was great my husband had the strawberry crepe and I had the open faced bagel sandwich. Both were wonderful. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop with wonderful tunes.  Forget the Starbucks down the street and try a little \"brooklyn-ish\" coffee shop."}
{"text":"I have been twice.  Heres what I know.    The regular coffee is good. The chai latte is really good.    They say they are suppose to be getting more bakery items which is good bc an apple fritter and coffee is my thing. If harris teeter it out, Im kinda SOL.   The staff has always been friendly and quick to serve me.  Even a little comical once. Perhaps she was using her own supply a little too much.  But it was funny so I find no fault there.    Love the fact they have meat and cheese trays with some wine.  Hate the fact they are not on the south side.    Overall, I will return and love the option of local business vs. craptaskic disneyfide starbucks."}
{"text":"Cool, modern place with a relaxed feel. The coffee is good, they had a decent food selection, and the baristas are very nice."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with a lot of space to study, read, hangout with friends. The menu has grown over the past couple of years to now serve breakfast (I.e. Belgian Waffle, French Toast, Breakfast Sandwiches, etc.) and lunch (Turkey Wrap, Fancy Grill Cheese, Chicken Salad Sandwich, etc.) and they have a wide variety of unique flavors for coffee, tea and cappuccinos. My favorite sweet drink is the Dirty Cheesecake Chai Latte. A great local stop for coffee and treats."}
{"text":"The food and coffee isn't terrible, but this place looks like a storage space. Not sure what the deal is with the garage sale atmosphere but it's really strange to sell used dvd's and stacked personal items at a food establishment. I assume that's an owner decision?"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is in the foundry building behind draught so it's in a hard to find location because not many business are in the space yet.   I've been here twice and have had good experiences. Both times I have had their iced vanilla chai tea and it's equivalent to Nova's! It tastes just like it!!!! They have a large selection of coffee drinks (plus 8 different flavors), teas and smoothies. They also serve some breakfast sandwiches, but keep in mind they make it fresh so it will take around 10+ minutes to make.   The workers seemed a little lost, but it's only been open for about a month now. I'm sure that will change. Also due to the location, I think they need to do some external advertising in order to promote the coffee shop.... Not many people know about it."}
{"text":"Waited over half an hour for one crepe and one wrap, just for them to get the order wrong too. I specifically asked if I could have the chicken bacon wrap with honey mustard instead of ranch, but they took 30 minutes to make the wrap with ranch in the end anyways. Was in a hurry so could not check the contents of the wrap until later, but when I did, it was just as I expected: disappointment. Workers worked very slowly and looked as if they hated their job. The food was edible though."}
{"text":"This a perfect combination of coffee shop ambiance meets lunch spot.  There is a variety of seating options including comfy sofa chairs and table and chair combos. They provide tons of electrical outlets for those that are looking to spend a good part of the day there and need the plugin.  They provide the traditional coffee shop offerings as well as fruit smoothies and spritzers. They have a full lunch menu of simple sandwich options."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick brunch with my fiancé and her family. The staff was super polite and patient and made sure that we were satisfied with our entire order. They kindly remade a frappacino that was a little too much on the sweet side and even helped accommodate and entertain the toddler in our party. This by far the friendliest experience I've had at a coffee shop which took me by surprise given its in the university area. The food was very impressive. The waffles were by far their best with perfect amount of softness and crunch. We all loved the cheese eggs and I very much enjoyed the bacon egg  and cheese breakfast crossaint sandwich. The iced coffee and iced latte we had met expectations as well. Unfortunately we didn't delve much into their beverage selection but we will definitely be return customers to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Nestled away in a shopping center on W. Mallard Creek Rd. you will find this chic cafe abundant with delicious pastries, coffee and breakfast options. I ordered the brunch bagel but substituted the bagel for their warm tender flakey croissant and removed the bacon from my sandwich making my platter a delicious egg and cheese croissant with a side of strawberries along with crispy hash browns . The staff is very friendly and helpful . Victoria in particular went out of her way to assist me and my counter parts to make us feel at home  . This isn't your ordinary cafe though they have live music on some nights and have been know to have dinner nights revolving around a specific type of cultural food. If you haven't been here your missing out !"}
{"text":"Love this place, great atmosphere, and the baristas are nice. They make great coffee art too!! I'm always up to support local businesses."}
{"text":"Great place to study and the people that work there are super nice! There's lots of space and good coffee is a plus!"}
{"text":"This place has the excellent variety of coffee, Chi tea,  expresso, cappuccino food good service"}
{"text":"Good concept, happy staff. Poor execution. Breakfast foods arrived randomly over a 30 min period. Coffee arrived half waythru around 15 min.  Just not rolling on all cylinders."}
{"text":"Great cappuccino! It's a local \"divey\" place and it's always nice to come back for a great cup of coffee"}
{"text":"Shame on you. You are not a crepery. You make one crepe and it's a disgrace. Half an hour to make a crepe? I'm not joking how long this took."}
{"text":"Upon entering the location one can notice this used to be an old Caribou Cafe. The decor is pretty nice. There's plenty of seating. However the menu is pretty limited. They also only offer regular and large drinks. The regular is a medium sized drink. There's no small. Other than that I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Coffee is great here as well as the dessert. I didn't give it 5 stars because the service was disorganized. We had 4 drinks in our order and they came one by one. They were very well made though. They also give you milk substitute such as soy milk and almond milk."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and tasty stuff...  But the service is so ridiculously slow it's painful. If you're in no hurry whatsoever then this is a nice place to come hang out...  If you're looking for a quick iced coffee go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is one my boyfriend's and my favorite brunch date spots in Charlotte. It is small, quaint, and comfortable, and the food is both beautifully arranged and delicious. The workers are very nice as well. You order your food, pay, and then they bring your meal when it's ready. The storefront is also decorated with things, like art and wine, for sale."}
{"text":"Walked in early Saturday morning, we liked cozy atmosphere, good menu selection and hospitality of the host."}
{"text":"Best place to sit, relax and do your thing while having tea or coffee. They also server bagel sandwiches and other stuff. I went here on one Sunday afternoon. It was not very busy. The place is very quite and got many comfortable office-like tables. I sat in front of the glass window looking at the parking lot. I enjoyed my tea while using their free wi-fi.  This is definitely the place I would like to go for some coffee time and internet time, if I am in town."}
{"text":"I love finding great local coffee joints that don't charge an arm and a leg for a good cup of Joe. Not only are their prices reasonable, each visit has been successful - great iced coffee, blended drinks, and the Chai options are creative and each flavor I've tried is great! I will definitely make this a regular coffee stop when I'm nearby."}
{"text":"They have a delicious chai tea here - and lots of flavoring to choose from. I haven't tried their food items but what I saw come out looked good. Service is really great."}
{"text":"Nice, cool, kitschy place, with extreme pleasant folks.  BUT food prep process is slow!!!!  30 mins from order to eating.  Not good for hungry little ones.   I'll go back for cafe but not for eating."}
{"text":"Great little spot for breakfast! Everyone who worked there was very friendly and the waffles and coffee were delicious! Also very baby friendly which was a huge plus."}
{"text":"Great local hang out. Dedicated baristas who care about what they serve and how it's done. Coffee isn't over roasted like that giant chain we all know so well. Great flavor and consistently good. The owner sources all his beans from local North Carolina roasters,  so it's as local as a coffee shop can be in every sense of the word. Always some fun music playing and people chatting it up. Laid back,  definitely check it out."}
{"text":"My two friends and I were kindly greeted upon entering the store and received excellent service while ordering. I ordered a vanilla latte and sat in the nicely laid out seating area that has a nice warm atmosphere. Our lattes came out after a short wait straight to our table by the barista. None of that starbucks stand and wait, call out your name crap. The latte was excellently crafted in both taste and appearance topped with a latte art rosetta, and one of my friends had a swan. The vanilla latte had a great froth and was not overly sweetened by the vanilla. We also bought a slice of iced vanilla pound cake which was also excellent and received a sample of an cinnamon apple type pastry that I can't wait to try the next time I go. I highly recommend this coffee shop."}
{"text":"I'm really confused at who all these reviewers are that are praising the coffee here. This place  \"specializes\" in basic coffee. They do drip coffee which is pretty inferior tasting and the lattes taste like flavored milk. I asked if they do pour-overs and they told me that only one staff member knows how to do it and that they weren't here that day. (sigh) Management can't train the rest of the staff??  On the tea side, they carry Stash brand bagged tea which is such a weak product quality and taste wise. Loose leaf tea would be such a better option.   And finally, while there is plenty of seating here, it feels a little too crowded with awkwardly shaped tables and strange shelving surrounding it and random debris underneath it. Debris as in crumbs, dirt, dust, napkins....  Small bright side though. Staff are eager. Lots of windows. Lots of seating. Plenty of parking.  Bright sides don't save it though. Won't be back...."}
{"text":"Though originally from Charlotte I only ever get to explore the area when I visit my parents nowadays, and this place is just minutes from my house! Located by HT and Trader Joe's, this cozy coffee shop hits the spot!  From the second you walk in you feel like you're at home! With all of it's modern cozy seating and upholstered benches all arranged in front of a fireplace, it feels like you're lounging in a living room. Especially with board games tucked around the place and stacks of newspapers and magazines, even if you don't bring your laptop you've got something to do.   There's cool artwork on the walls and even a community guitar with signatures of those who have played it. Very cool.   FINALLY on to the coffee and food. We tried their breakfast dishes, served all day. The sandwiches boast eggs cooked in a waffle-maker and the croissants are fluffy and flaky. I tried the spicy mayan mochachino, which had just a hint of spice and was a pleasure to drink.   Both my boyfriend and I enjoyed this place and will definitely return when we visit Charlotte again. Locals, enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's so weird to me because it actually used to be a Caribou Coffee before they all went out of business.  But anyhow, this place is really quaint. They have board games for you to play with and a HUGE selection of breakfast items for you to choose from, even more than coffee! It's a great first date location, considering this was the location of a first date I had.   The service was great, everyone was really friendly and accommodating. If you're new to the university area I would highly recommend this spot to check out."}
{"text":"I got an rasperry hibiscus iced tea and two macaroons. The macaroons were a little harder than usual but still good. The tea was amazing though! Very strong yet still delicate. Not to mention the very friendly staff and wonderful atmosphere. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Great place awesome atmosphere and they have specialty Saturday nights with different themes."}
{"text":"Great spot with full breakfast and lunch menu. Service is courteous and food is good. We will stop by again if we're in the area."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed by this place. Went in and asked the server if they had any drinks that weren't tea or coffee. Smart lady says \"we have chai.\" Face, meet palm. Chai IS tea. In fact, chai literally translates to tea in Hindi. Shame that the staff wouldn't know such a basic difference. I ended up getting some hot chocolate and didn't care for it much. I still drank it, but I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I had the breakfast, it was mediocre.  They were out of waffle mix which I had already payed for, the hash browns tasted frozen and bland.  Eggs, toast, and bacon was good.  having to wait 10 min after the rest of my breakfast for the waffle was no bueno."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with my boyfriend. He ordered a chicken salad croissant and I had a Belgian waffle combo. Service was really slow, my food took 45mins!! My boyfriend finished his food and I still hadn't gotten mine. Luckily they have board games so that kept us distracted. I tried some of the chicken salad and it was delicious! Smoothies are alright. The two guys behind the counter looked very lost and couldn't handle all the customers (they were only 9 people in the place). The food was delicious and the place is really nice. Only gave it 3 stars due to the amount of time I had to wait for my food."}
{"text":"It's a nice cozy place. The environment is very relaxing. I didn't care for their coffee much but the desserts are very good. The tiramisu is the best!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  Great coffee and a great food menu.  The place is very cozy and the staff is amazing."}
{"text":"Staff, service, and beverages are always on point. The service is extremely fast for individually handcrafted drinks. They also host events such as wine tastings and live music :) I always order an iced dirty chai, theirs is by far the best!!! This place is MUCH better than a Starbucks."}
{"text":"This is a very cozy place. It is difficult to find, but well worth it.  I had the filthy chai and it was by far the best I've ever had. Prices are good and the staff was friendly and welcoming. I was pleased with my find and will be back."}
{"text":"I uploaded a picture of my \"turkey sausage\" that I think speaks for itself.  Along with the fact my Hashbrown was covered in burnt pieces that could only be explained by a beyond dirty grill, I give Cafeccino 1-star.  I also had to call 4 times before anyone answered so I could place an order for pick-up."}
{"text":"First encounter: I asked barista if they had iced coffee, as it was not on the menu, and I got a rude and offputting answer back: \"We can make anything iced\", as if I should've known. I next asked what the wifi password was and got another offputting answer: \"It's right there\" while pointing to the chalkboard. Sorry to bother you while I'm paying for your services!!!  Second encounter: I tried to give this place another try. Sensed tension between the two baristas (one was not so nice to the other). And, the one barista mopped the floor around the table and by my feet while I was sitting/studying.   The tables are cheap and squeaky. The furniture/shelving units in the coffee shop is storage space for their office supplies (office max paper, folders, printers, shredders etc).  Needless to say, won't be back."}
{"text":"The coffee is delicious and the barista are friendly. It is a great local coffee house for meeting, work or study."}
{"text":"Great place to study, hangout, or just relax. This place makes a great dirty chai latte, and their breakfast and lunch menu is pretty solid. Location is conveniently located about 10-12 minutes outside of the uptown area, and within a stones throw of many other staple Charlotte areas. The vibe is great, and the food is great. I'm only giving 4 stars because the two times I've been here, they are low on paper towels on the bathroom. Great place."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and service! Food is great too! My fav weekend brunch place!   Try the morning glory breakfast or the baileys special !"}
{"text":"Cute and friendly little coffee shop with a nice variety of bottles craft beer. I can't speak for the food but the coffee was well made and the waffles looked good!"}
{"text":"Once the home of Caribou Coffee, this University hangout was reborn as Cafeccino.  It boasts the stereotypical coffeehouse decor and offers plenty of seating.  The menu, however, is limited and the staff seems uneducated in the likes of coffee.  Looking for a latte?  This place may work for you.  Seeking counter culture?  They'll give you that tilted head, confused puppy look.  Not that I have any room to talk.  That's the same look I flaunted when I first learned of counter culture and pour over.  Now a lover of both, most other coffee can only be described as lacking.  Cafeccino does offer the pour over method but, for me, the coffee was nearly undrinkable.  Perhaps a little pour over training is in order.  Either way, this place just wasn't for me.  I felt as though they were more concerned about their image than their product.  An investment in product knowledge would go a long way.    In addition, they offered a nice patio area but kept the door leading out to it locked.  What's the point?  I first tried entering through that door as I parked near the back patio.  Upon realizing that it was locked, I was forced to pass by the ever so pleasant dumpster while walking around to the front.  This business sets facing West Mallard Creek Church Road and any foot traffic would likely try entering through that patio door first.  Just FYI, an open door is typically viewed as more inviting.  Just sayin'!"}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop. Horrible for food though - husband and I went for breakfast. They only made one plate at a time, so by the time our second plate came out first was cold. He got the waffles and enjoyed them, although the eggs were rubbery. I ordered the French toast, only had two bites before sending back. Would not recommend for food."}
{"text":"Great lattes and open late! I was genuinely surprised that they had food and to what extent. Will definitely go back there to try breakfast or dessert"}
{"text":"This is strictly a food based review, which is unfortunate because the staff was very friendly and the coffee was delicious!  I left cafeccino being greatly disappointed because of my meal. I was a little hesitant when I gave my order at the front and noticed the chef already beginning to make my waffle, where merely three to four waffle pans were, right near the register. After about a 20 minute wait, my friend and I finally got our breakfast, which I was amused by the iron imprinted eggs. Not to my surprise, my waffle was extremely cold, and the cold syrup didn't help any. The turkey bacon was pretty good, as were the hash browns, but the ironed eggs were awful and rubbery. Since they have such a mediocre kitchen setup, I don't see why the owner can't invest in an actual frying pan so they can cook real eggs (which mine were cold as well). Getting a few more kitchen prep items could make this place much better, as well as keeping the whole meal hot since they have to basically cook one thing at a time.  All in all, I would only go back for the coffee and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great coffee/tea place. Lattes, cappuccinos, blended coffees, breakfast sandwiches and bakery items are all great!  LOVE that they offer almond milk and not just soy milk for the dairy-free customers like me.  Prices are good too. Drink sizes are much larger than competitive coffee houses in the area.  Nice lounging area. Although small there are plenty of areas to sit in or relax. I like that they have board games to play if you just want to chill with your coffee and a friend or partner on a lazy weekend.  I'm starting to become a regular here."}
{"text":"I can't tell ya'll how happy I am that a coffee shop opened up in the Third Ward. It has locally sourced coffee, breakfast, and pastry.   Goodbye Seattle mermaid."}
{"text":"Pretty amazing find. Multicultural, is the feeling I had while there...Forgot I was in Charlotte. Very clean, very nice place to go... Plenty of food for the money. I highly recommend checking this place out. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I visited a couple of times when they first opened and was eager to try them because they offered milkshakes. The first two visits left me with coffee that taste like a warm milkshake (yuck!) and a milkshake that taste like a \"mistake\" drink, to say the least. The barista was happy to remake it so I didn't let it bother me and chucked the error in the \"new place, still settling\" category.   A month or so later, I stopped in to grab a quick hot coffee with some cream and sugar before starting my day (simple). After ordering, I watched the guy that was making my drink pick a scab on his elbow while brewing a fresh cup of coffee then proceed to grab the lid with the same hand to place it on my drink. Before my drink was even handed to me, I got the attention of another person and explained my concern and requested someone else remake it. Got the coffee and it was still not pleasant, even after all the cream and sugar added. I haven't been back since."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for any time of the day. It's homey & welcoming with yummy food & beverages. You MUST try their chai lattes...they have so many different flavors. They also make them dirty. You thought Starbucks was good? Cafeccino is so much better. Their coffee tastes fresh & not burnt. And I don't even like coffee lol To put it simply...this place is a MUST in the NE side of Charlotte."}
