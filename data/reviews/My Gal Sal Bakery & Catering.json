{"text":"Cake pops by Sal is wonderful. The cake pops are delicious and all the kids really enjoyed them. They are just the right size and not messy. We had them at a school party and the teachers loved them as well. We will definitely use Sal again!"}
{"text":"Once again a fabulous dinner party created by Sal and her team.  If you want great food, lovely presentation and no no stress for the hostess please do call My Gal Sal Catering."}
{"text":"The best French Macaroons you will ever have. The selection of flavors will blow you over. The atmosphere is fun and cheerful,if I lived close by it would be my go to bakery. Even though i live in the east valley I will make it a point to get my bakery goods for special occasions at My Gal Sals"}
{"text":"Sal catered our wedding this past September. She was wonderful about working through all of the logistics with us throughout the entire process. Her food was amazing and her staff is as friendly and attentive and Sal is herself.  She really went out of her way to accommodate the type of food we wanted at our wedding while working in fairly strict parameters. Our reception really was one of a kind thanks to Sal and her crew. We received so many compliments on the Greek food she prepared for the event. I would highly recommend My Gal Sal for any event, big or small."}
{"text":"Tried the breakfast croissant,  my friends tried the croissants and raspberry cheesecake. We were so impressed,  that we left with a chocolate eclair, a slice of coffee cake, a piece of tiramisu, a cannoli and a couple of macaron's. We were not disappointed when we finally consumed all that deliciousness the next day. Do yourself a favor, if you are in the area, go and give My Gal Sal a try..... it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Sal did an amazing job on my daughter's smash cake for her first birthday. Not only was it gluten free but she substituted the sugar for bananas and applesauce. I would recommend her to anyone! They also are extremely reasonable and very sweet to deal with. :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Everyone is so nice, the food is great and generous portions to boot. The new owners have really stepped up their menu with breakfast, lunch a goodies, Yumm"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a cake pop and some tortes. Easy in, easy out. Sal puts a smile on your face and yummy in your tummy. I was wanting her delicious chicken pot pie. It's coming soon. I'll have to go back just for that. My granddaughter loved her pink sprinkled cake pop. And she picked out a pink torte for her mommy. I had chocolate of course. We shared and both were delightful!"}
{"text":"I was shopping around for a cake for a birthday party, and the owner was incredibly helpful, and sweet. She suggested buying cake by the slice for our \"tasting\". We ended up buying a European style coffee sponge (cake), and an European style strawberry cream sponge, and a sample plate. I wish other bakeries would follow her lead in terms of reducing waste. She has an assortment of vegan and gluten free desserts. We can't wait to go back to try her American style cakes."}
{"text":"We just happened to be driving down 35th Avenue and I somehow spotted this little bakery tucked into a strip mall. We went in towards the end of the day the the selection was small but there were still yummy options. We chose the raspberry creme cake slice, a lemon bar, and cannolis. Everything was delicious but our favorite was the cannoli. They had some delicious looking cake pops and macarons that we will try next time. The owner was so friendly and helpful and that alone makes someone want to come back."}
{"text":"While driving up 35th Ave one day, we noticed My Gal Sal in the shopping center where another bakery used to be. We recognized the sign as being one that is at the Uptown Farmer's Market where my kids like to get cake pops. I'm not a cake pop fan but we decided to swing on in to get a treat. There is so much more than just cake pops - i am so happy we stopped by.  The bakery has a nice selection of individual desserts - cakes, macarons, muffins - even some gluten free options. My favorite are the eclairs but I think I'm going to try the napoleons next. Everything looks so delicious. I believe the pastry chef is the same chef from the bakery that previously occupied the space so if you were a fan, then this place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Delicious! Hearty breakfast sandwich on one of the best croissants I've ever tasted. Served with potatoes (yummy). Pastries are amazing."}
{"text":"We stopped by just to see if there was something good to eat for Emma for lunch and we pleasantly surprised that they have a variety of gluten-free options Emma had a great kiss Adia and they offered her a free cake pop with her lunch it was an awesome lunch definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for a gluten free establishment. Wife has Celiac Disease so it's difficult to find a good place, not to mention a bakery! Sal helped me the minute I walked in. Greeted warmly and was provided with information about goods and services. Stayed for lunch and took home some tasty treats for the wife. Cannolis, eclairs, muffins, cake, cupcakes and even macaroons! Definitely excited into find this place in the West Valley!"}
{"text":"Cake pops rocks! Great way to bring a desert that no one will forget! Very yummy the owner makes every pop herself she a small business, women owned delivering the best cake pops with  uniqueness to your liking. Try her out at your next party, I got them for a party everybody thought they great idea, unique clever artistic & yummy. Best way to bring a dish to a potluck."}
{"text":"We ordered cake pops for our son's birthday parties two years in a row and had great experiences with Sal each time. The cake pops she created were absolutely adorable and fit with our themes (Baseball and Elmo). Everyone at the parties seemed to enjoy them too and it sure was less messy than cupcakes or slices of cake and perfect to hold for small hands. We met Sal when we shopped at the Central Farmers Market a few years ago. She has such a fun energy about her and she really does whatever she can do to make things work for our cake pop needs. I highly recommend you check her out at the market, try some of her flavors and discuss your needs/ideas. She also makes the container to hold the cake pops too."}
{"text":"I'm no good critic but I wish I were.  A colleague brought in a fruit tart for me from My Gal, Sal, as a payback.  Boy was it an amazing treat!   Not only does it Not have the gross jelly topping to seal in the fruit and custard, but the crust is such a sweet treat on its own.  Coming from a European background heavy in dry coffee cakes this crust is amazing, sweet, crumbly and moist. Yummy yum yum!!"}
{"text":"I happen to find this bakery after trying to order desserts and a cake for my mother's birthday tea party. I am so glad that the other bakery's employees and manager were rude and nasty, claiming that they never spoke with me about an order. My Gal Sal's was exactly what I was looking for! When we first entered the bakery, we were met with one of the friendliest people, Sal. She was very knowledgeable, professional and helpful. By the time we left I was extremely happy with the choices and the prices. All of the pastries I ordered were great! They were fresh and tasted just like or better than the samples. The cake was very good. Everyone wanted to know where I ordered from. I can't say enough good things about Sal and her delicious baked goods. Thank you Sal!"}
{"text":"It's so hard to find a good, local bakery in Phoenix that isn't a grocery store. My Gal Sal has a wide variety of choices and it's not too far from the north valley. Very Delicious macarons!!"}
{"text":"It's not often one can find allergen friendly items that actually taste delicious & don't cost an arm and leg. Luckily Sal's bakery is finally somewhere we can take my daughter & not have to worry about her being let down by finding out an item has dairy/gluten. She has a whole entire display case on it's own of allergen friendly items! My daughter gets to walk up and choose ANY item which has not happened before. The service is top notch, Sal is so sweet & makes sure all her customers have a great experience. She uses quality ingredients & no soy or artificial fillers/preservatives. This is now our go-to bakery!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on Valentine's Day. They still had plenty of delicious things. Got some baked goods for friends and some GF items to bring home. Everyone loved their treats. Thank you so much for helping out the community of people with food allergies. It is so awesome to be able to accommodate everyone. I no longer have small children - but I so glad you are there to let kids with allergies be able to have something from the case!!"}
{"text":"I write reviews because I love food, not for any other reason. And I write it as I feel it. Always supporting local businesses, so that's why when I saw the reviews for this place I could care less for the long ride. I just had to have it! So, I did, and I gotta say, but based on my personal experience this was not the for me. I am sooo glad everyone else likes it... But I personally could not even get a price, instead I was immediately pointed to the board, as if it was too much work to just let me know. Which is ok. Next time I will be more careful to read the board under the premise I won't feel pressured to buy (lol). I'm glad they sell water & that everyone buys it and pays for it, but it was my first time in the state of AZ that a biz did not give the courtesy cup of water. I was not explained by the attendant as to why. I was just pointed to buying a bottle. And to make it all even better I just learned that they had courtesy coffee but I was never offered our even informed. That actually sounds nice!!! And would have been awesome to know but my experience was totally different though. I ordered decaf, but none available, so I was out of luck on that too. In the end, the drive there from home is far, so based on that alone I won't be back, but I do see employees take pride in their business and I wish them the best."}
{"text":"The most AMAZING gluten-free experience I have ever had. Everything that I've tried so far is superb! I suggest the breakfast burrito and any one of her desserts. I would go there every day if I didn't have to work when she's open. Luckily, I have Saturdays."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast and lunch too...along with being a great source to satisfy your sweet tooth. Stopped in here the other day to check out what they had to offer and got myself a sandwich made on a fresh baked croissant, yummy and the carrot cake was good too.  They have breakfast and lunch options available all day. I noticed they had many options for people with food sensitivities like to gluten and/or sugar. They have all types of desserts from American styles like donuts, carrot cakes to European delights with layers of sweet heaven.  This place is located in a strip mall type area, with plenty of parking. It's on the smaller side in the customer area but they do have a few tables inside so you can eat there. Everyone I talked to was very nice as well."}
{"text":"Awesome Bakery for families with diverse dietary needs. You got regular items, gluten-free, dairy-free, and even vegan items.    Not only do they have Bakery items but they make breakfast and lunch foods including sandwiches, burritos, quiche, quesadillas and salads.   My wife is Gluten-Free but I am not, it's great to find a place that has things both of us can enjoy!"}
{"text":"One of the BEST bakeries in Phoenix. Breakfast burrito was stuffed and delicious. And then onto dessert....Sal's chocolate cake should be illegal it is so decadent. It was a pleasure to spend a Saturday morning there.  And Thank You for creating a last minute cake for our neighbor."}
{"text":"My new favorite bakery!! :) I was recently diagnosed with Celiacs and have yet to find a gluten free bakery- until now. This bakery not only serves yummy desserts, but they serve lunch and breakfast. They keep all gluten free items in a separate case so there's no cross contamination. One of the owners has Celiacs herself, thus- she knows how important it is not to get gluten.  Cupcakes are the bomb here"}
{"text":"These cake pops were amazing! Not too sweet but just perfect. Sal has such great energy and was very understanding."}
{"text":"Everything in here is delicious !!! From cake pops to macarons. From brownies to lemon bars yummy treats!!! Made by the best Sal!!! So glad you have opened up your shop Sal! Love coming here !"}
{"text":"Stop there to check it out on Thursday and I was impressed. The cakes there were amazing. They have so many varieties to choose from. It was so good especially the Napoleon cake. The staffs were so friendly and helpful. Definitely will be back for more yummy desserts"}
{"text":"Delicious cake pops!  I tried white and brownie - nice and moist but not too mushy as others I'd had.  I love shopping local and trying out new places."}
{"text":"I was finally able to have a delicious piece of cake for the first time in over a year! Finding a true gluten free bakery with amazing deserts and food, is a dream come true! I can't wait to drive the hour next week to try the macaroons!"}
{"text":"I have been to the bakery a couple of times and had awesome experience! I'm gluten free due to a gluten allergy that will cause me to go into anaphylactic shock. I have never had an issue with anything I have gotten from here. I have had the banana bread, muffins, macaroons, cannolis and the breakfast burrito. I haven't been able to have a burrito since i had to go gluten free and I was so excited that they not had gluten free tortillas but they were fresh and homemade."}
{"text":"This is my family's absolute favorite bakery. The owner, Sal, is one of the nicest and most genuine people you will ever meet. All of the employees are so kind, helpful, and down to earth. They have a wide variety of pastries and desserts that are vegan, gluten free, and all of there regular sweets are wonderful as well. They have a spectacular breakfast and lunch menu, I haven't had anything off of their menu I didn't enjoy. I always leave satisfied and happier than when I came in. I would 100% recommend this bakery if you're looking for a cozy, welcoming place to enjoy some sweets and/or a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  The best chocolate cake I have EVER had, seriously.  The staff was very friendly and the owner talked with me for a while.  This is a place where I want to spend my money"}
{"text":"Wow! I was in Phoenix for a couple of days looking at colleges with my son.  We were looking for something for dessert and saw this bakery on the map.  Stopped in and were immediately impressed with how clean and well laid out it was with great baked goods on display.  Definitely not your average items and a very nice variety of gluten free and special dietary items as well.  I especially like the way she has the gluten free and normal items separated all the way from ingredient storage to distinct display cases.  In many stores you don't see the \"back of the house\" but Sal is proud of her bakery and her bakers and insists on a clear view to their areas.  Had a lemon bar and son had chocolate raspberry cake, both were \"over the top\" fresh and flavorful.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a corner shop is a golden nugget.  I'll be honest, I've never brought any of their cakes BUT I have eaten lunch there.  You have got to try the pulled pork with the potato salad. Presented well and so tasty.  Just be sure to have some baby wipes or something. Pretty messy but well worth it."}
{"text":"Just had a bacon and pepper jack croissant breakfast sandwich with a side of potatoes.  Yum yum.  Croissant is freshly baked-- just out of the oven.    We also bought a dozen croissants to go as well as a dozen cannoli.     Can't say enough good things about anything Sal makes.  It's all delicious and appealing to the eye to boot!!!   You gotta stop by and check her out.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were driving by after eating lunch at Loving Hut and noticed the word \"vegan\" on the window at this bakery. They were very busy and it's a tiny shop, so I didn't want to ask a lot of questions. Most of the vegan items were not on display (were in plastic bins on the bottom shelf of the display), so I just went with two vegan pops - chocolate covered white cake with chocolate chips. They had vegan cup cakes and cake slices too in the bins, but it looked like they were mostly gluten free (which I'm not).   The chocolate coating was thick and cool - not melty. However, my first bite was entirely full of chocolate chips - no cake - so it was kind of gross and hard to eat (they weren't melted chips - were just cold chips). There was some cake in the next bite, but I not enough for me to get a sense of how it tasted. After the third bite it was gone!   So first impressions were not great, but I'd be willing to go back again sometime when I can explore the menu further. It looks like they serve lunch too, and some items were marked vegetarian, but I'd have to ask questions to see what could be made vegan."}
{"text":"What an awesome bakery! First of all the sandwiches are amazing and the potato salad is to die for.  I absolutely love getting cakes made for special events and having to order a blah cake from a grocery store is lame. The cake pops are decorated with pearls and glitter and they can even add custom logos.  You can clearly see inside the kitchen and it is sparkling clean.  Will definitely be a regular customer now! Yay I found a cute little local bakery with affordable prices!"}
{"text":"I had a vision on what type & flavor I want my macaroons to be and not only did Sal went above & beyond my expectations, she completely made my bridal shower extra special.   I don't live in AZ (I use too) however my Maid of Honor went and did a tasting with Sal. She gave my MOH the best flavors & flavors she think would fit my macaroon idea. The process was easy!   Will be ordering more items in the future."}
{"text":"So I was going to go on a diet on Monday then I find out my Daughter won a Raffle at her school. When I went to the school there were these beautiful decorated cake pops. I have almost have eaten all of them secretly in a hiding spot so my daughter won't see me. These cake pops are amazing. I will definitely will be referring people."}
{"text":"Great service, scrumptious cakes and a whole case dedicated to gluten-free...can I say, yes please!"}
{"text":"We had an event at the O'Connor House and worked with My Gal Sal and everything was wonderful!!  Sal was so helpful and easy to work with, the food was amazing and the event went smoothly.  I can't recommend her enough!"}
{"text":"Sal rocks. So do her Pops! She is big-hearted and they are big-flavored. What a difference in quality whole-food ingredients make...and it is obvious they are made with lots of love. We haven't ordered for any big events, but we've still probably shared over 160 Pops over the last few years...EVERYone loves them and wants to know where they can find more. Those with suger-, gluten-, or other-free needs are always tickled to find there is a more-than-tasty Pop for them, too. Of all the \"free-on-your-birthday\" treats we've signed up for over the years, Sal's are the only ones we actually go get! She always remembers our daughter and this year went above and beyond to help her celebrate her 21st birthday with all her friends and staff at her adult day-training program. Sal is a gem...I don't know if you'll love her or her cake pops more!"}
{"text":"Seriously, the best cake pops I've ever tasted. I hired Sal to make special ones for a trade show and not only did they look perfect, but they tasted perfect. I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Love this spot! Awesome selection of sweets and the breakfast croissants are delicious! The cakes are light, fluffy with the perfect sweetness. Gluten-free options too!  A must try!"}
{"text":"It was our first time going in to the restaurant, and we were not disappointed. Mary greeted us with a smile and informed us of all the tasty treats they offer. Then she told us about the breakfast meals and we made our choices. She had the bacon onion keish, i had a bacon burrito and we were both ecstatic with the meal. Each one was divine, giving way to the next bite of mouthwatering goodness. The coffe was also delicious and some of the best beating out starbucks if you ask me. When Sal came out to greet us and see how we were doing was such a great feeling, not just her personality but her attention to detail is superb. We left happily satisfied and found a new favorite spot in Glendale. We are definately coming back to eat and hang out with the wonderful ladies here at my gal Sals bakery and caffee. Thank you Sal for the exquisite meal and welcoming environment. We'll see you ladies soon."}
{"text":"I used Sal to create cake pops for my sisters engagement party and was so pleased. She worked with me to make custom designs and went out of her way to accommodating; and on short notice!  She even made me special vegan and gluten free matching options which was very nice because I rarely get to partake in sweets!  The cake pops were a complete hit and unlike cupcakes or cake, there were no leftovers at the end of the party!   It was convenient to pick them up from the Uptown Farmers Market in a Saturday where she also sells individual cake pops including those vegan gluten free ones. I've been dreaming about them ever sense and can't wait to have another.   Highly recommend using Sal for cake pops."}
{"text":"Came here a long time ago when it was Napoleon Bakery and decided to come back when I saw another bakery had opened in here. The service isn't quite the same but you can tell they are trying. \"Sal\" can seem a bit rude at first but you can tell she is trying to be friendly and that's just her personality. The others in the shop are very friendly and helpful! They serve sandwiches, burritos, etc and not just their bakery items, so that's definitely a plus! I will probably visit again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"6 stars I went in to order a cake on short notice [48 hrs]. There were some obstacles in my request, but they made it happen. The cake came out perfect.  Sometimes attractive cakes are more for show and less flavourful.  Not the case here,  best chocolate cake I've ever had.   Today,  we stopped in to pick up some sweets to take home after a day of shopping. After I tried a piece of brownie,  I asked my GF to go buy the rest.  She didn't even hesitate.   Did I mention you can stop in and pick up a sandwich for lunch?"}
{"text":"Great spot and amazing staff. Always willing to meet the customers needs with special orders. Great spot for lunch too!"}
{"text":"Suuuper disappointed here. My friend told me about a gluten free bakery on the West side and I decided I needed to try it out. Since my regular spot only has donuts on the weekend, I thought I'd make the hike over to My Gal Sal's for a treat. I ordered two donuts to go. Let me just say that the only reason I actually paid for them is because they made them especially for me while I waited in the lobby (It only took them 5ish minutes to fry - the wait didn't phase me at all.) And the only reason I ATE them is because I paid $8 something for two donuts. They were completely underwhelming and reminded me more of hard biscuits with holes in the middle than donuts. I'm glad I didn't buy more items to try but if someone bought me a cake for my birthday I'd probably give it a go."}
{"text":"We found My Gal Sal Bakery & Catering through Yelp and I must say that all the positive reviews are spot on.  We called Sal to prepare desserts for our wedding reception.  She was amazing to work with and the desserts were FANTASTIC!  We received so many compliments on the cake pops, bars and the wedding cake.  I can't figure out how to add pictures to my review so I am going to post them separately.  I wouldn't think twice about using this bakery again - thanks Sal!!!"}
{"text":"I recently found this gem by accident everything is delicious I'm continuously telling all my friends and family about this place"}
{"text":"What a cute little shop, we just went for the first time. Super excited to find a place that makes fresh French macaroons! My only complaint is that I paid for a dozen macaroons and only got 11, but no big deal, for the price, it was still well worth it! ($1.75 each) We also got a slice of cake and a cute cake pop that my son LOVED!  We will DEFINITELY be returning, frequently."}
{"text":"Great place! We stopped in for a little snack on our way home from a long trip. Super friendly service!!! I had the banana bread it was so good. Definitely will come back again."}
