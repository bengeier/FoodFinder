{"text":"Had the chicken gyro and the wife had the traditional gyro platter. Both plates were fresh and tasty. The place is super clean and the staff was very friendly. Will go there again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Very authentic Greek food and very good service. I love the gyro there. So much better than Showmars and that is good IMO."}
{"text":"My wife and I both ordered the giro combo plate. 3/4's of my wife's fries were burned. The chicken was extremely dry and tasteless. When I asked for the tzatziki sauce to put on the dry chicken, I was told that the sauce is an extra charge. The salad was ok. Maybe one day we will get a good Greek restaurant in Wesley Chapel."}
{"text":"Visited twice in last 2 weeks. Traditional gyro is way to go. Get extra sauce. Plain Hummus had a strange mint flavor. Will try different flavor next time. Salted fries were good. Kids menu nice. Look for coupons in magazines. Baklava was excellent!"}
{"text":"Delish. The service was great. Nicole and Olivia were helpful with our orders and kept the place clean. Love me some Gyros."}
{"text":"Lemon oregano fries are amazing. Freshly made hummus every day, with several varieties available. Very friendly staff, very clean and bright restaurant. A keeper!"}
{"text":"A favorite gem in an area lacking Greek food. Excellent gyros, tzatziki, kabobs, salads, flavored humuses and fries. Oh, and the falafel is a must try- flavorful and rich the way it should be, not dry and crusty the way some places serve it. The pita is soft and delicious and the staff is friendly and efficient. They just expanded their menu and I'm enjoying sampling my way through it. I only wished we lived closer and could do take-out!"}
{"text":"I just finished dinner here with my two teenagers. We all loved it! The lemon oregano fries are awesome. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We were too full to try the baklava but we will go back."}
{"text":"Living in Waxhaw, we would eat at Greco Fresh Grille in Blakeney when it was convenientl  Since they have just recently opened up in Wesley Chapel ..right next to Hickory Tavern, it's very convenient. The place has a very fresh decor, simply done.. and not overdone.  Still have 'semi-service' as I call it.  Order at the register and they bring the food to you.   Being a huge fan of Lamb.. I got a burger with Lemon and Oregano fries.. All fantastic.  Especially the fries..!!. worth going just for the fries IMHO of course.  Got side of Tzatski sauce with the fries.. and it is equaly as good.  The owner said they just opened the doors quietly a week ago, but everything went smooth, and it was also quite busy.  We'll be back often for sure.  Great addition to the food choices for residents in Wesley Chapel; WXW; Weddington NC."}
{"text":"Best Greek food ever! Scratch that, best FOOD ever! LOL. Wait staff rules and so does the food. Thankful for such culture in our neighborhood. Make sure to tip!! Jar always looks too empty :("}
{"text":"Amazingly tasty Greek food! It is beautifully decorated, clean and friendly people. Between my kids and I, there was plenty to eat for vegetarians. We overindulged in fact. I only wish I lived closer!!"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! Lemon oregano fries are so good!! Fast service and nice setting."}
{"text":"All I can say to start off is WOW! I have passed the place a million times and had no idea what a gem it was!  It is a small place with a few outdoor tables and more inside, the welcome at the door was warm and inviting without being obnoxious or fake.    I ordered take out, but noticed that the dine in area is clean.  I am a pescatarian,  so I ordered the Greco Mezze Platter that is a sampler of hummus, tzatziki, spinach pie triangles (3), stuffed grape leaves, feta, olives and pita.  I also got the Lahano salata (side size).  First off, the mezze platter is fantastic. There was nothing I didn't absolutely love.  Serving is ample for 8.95 and everything is SO flavorful!   The stuffed grape leaves may be the most delicious thing I've had on my tongue in a while and their fresh tzatziki sauce puts others to shame.  The salad was also tremendously flavorful and everything was clearly fresh and recently prepared.    I highly recommend this restaurant for lunch or dinner.  I know I have suddenly become a regular!"}
{"text":"Very nice to have a new option in the area. Excellent flavor a. Had the gyro and the chicken gyro, both very good. The fries are great with a lot of flavor options. The baklava was good. Staff is friendly and you can get takeout pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Our first time at this location which is super closer to our home and we were not disappointed. The food was tasty the staff was friendly and the restaurant itself is much larger than the other location in Blakney. I personally like the painting as it puts you in the mindset of Athens, Greece which my husband and I have visited several times.   The owner is usually onsite here and our last visit we happen to be waiting for our food at a booth and I had our teenager and her friend with us and we started to talk about the food in Athens and compare American-Greek to authentic Greek Food and he happen to come over and we shared some similar restaurant likings in Athens as he is from near there which is was totally cool to know and chat about.  They are pretty good at getting your food out hot and Fresh. I think I'm hung up on the lack of diversity in the staffing. I'll support but I have noticed that lack as our teenager applied and never heard from anyone even after going in several times to check in. However a neighbors child with NO experience applied amen they hired with no incident. Mind you our daughter has a plethora of experience."}
{"text":"Ate at their Blakeney location so glad they open this location closer to home. Greek gyros are amazing. Prices very fair staff friendly and clean. Love this place. Highly recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"Yum love the lamb and the lemon salad with arugula and cabbage. We enjoy eating in and taking out."}
{"text":"Greco fresh in waxhaw is excellent the food is always fresh and delicious and the service is great. Easy to get to with pretty of parking."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick dinner here, amazingly great food! Great atmosphere nice staff..highly recommend trying if you haven't already. Will defiantly be one of my weekly go to places from now on!"}
{"text":"Good was great. Restaurant was small and crowded when I went. I'm glad I got my good! My only issue was I wanted the platter that came with the gyro, side salad and fries. When I got home I had only received the gyro and fries. I would probably go back just to try something new."}
{"text":"Still the best restaurant ever. The food is delicious and I've really been hooked on the salad! This place is to die for"}
{"text":"Very greasy food, some items were ok, but I won't go back....just didn't seem like the freshest quality & everything was extra greasy."}
{"text":"I had heard how good the gyro's were here. Very disappointed!!  The chicken had little flavor. Very boring food. Won't go back."}
{"text":"my friend asked me to lunch one day and she picked. it was a great pick btw. it is small on the inside (not many places to sit when busy ) but they do have seating outside in the warmer months. the food is awesome. they even have a kids menu. the service is good and they want to make sure you are always happy."}
{"text":"I always feel so welcome when I eat here. I love the fresh flowers on the tables...really adds a nice touch! We've eaten the gyros, greek salad, falafel, hummus, chicken with rice, and the food is always really fresh! The staff really cares about the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"This was not our first visit to Gr√©co Fresh and it will not be our last. The gyros are always good -- we sometimes get lamb and other times chicken. This time we ordered the lamb platter (very well prepared-- tasty and tender) and the mezze platter with chipotle hummus -- and everything was delicious. Their tzatziki sauce can't be beat and I recommend splurging on an extra side of it. It is delicious on everything... from pita to spanakopita. Their baklava is also delicious!"}
{"text":"This is the second location same as Blakeney restaurant. It's amazing! Gyro is my favorite, chicken skewers are also fantastic. Tonight I got a Greek salad to go with chicken skewers. Salad size is perfect with big chunks of feta fresh tomatoes and great dressing. Lemon oregano fries are also my favorite. Hope this place stays for the long run, it's hard to find a good place in Wesley chapel. This place rivals close by Greek food, the cabbage slaw salad is the best around in my opinion beating the expensive competitor."}
{"text":"After an afternoon workout,  at our local YMCA, our energy levels were low. We decided to have a salad and stopped by the GFG for a light lunch. We were very satisfied with the freshness of our greens and the generous portion of feta cheese. We both added a protein, chicken which was well seasoned despite being a bit dry. Because our visit was well after the lunch hour, we may have gotten some leftovers. The warm pitas were a welcome addition. We enjoyed our lunch but will be mindful of the time we visit."}
{"text":"Greco Fresh Grille is one of the better places to stop by for lunch without breaking the bank. The food is really well made and they have a good variety of choices if you're not feeling too exotic. It's a nice local restaurant that cares about its customers. The fries are very good for a Greek place and the place itself is not too shabby."}
{"text":"Great little Greek gem!  Our family eats here and gets take-out on a bi-weekly basis. The food is always good and fresh.  The prices are very reasonable and we often have leftovers to munch on later.  Super nice folks behind the counter and in the kitchen.  Good diner atmosphere, but not really set up for a 'waiter' to be at your table checking on you every couple minutes...if you need something you just ask and they get it.  Super (pretty healthy) kid friendly meals."}
{"text":"Nice fresh food, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! My husband and I just moved to the area and stumbled upon this gem one evening while at the shopping center. We ordered two gyros, which were phenomenal, and a side order of warm pita slices with tzatziki sauce. We loved it so much we've ordered takeout several more times since. Let me just say their tzatziki is my absolute favorite - perfection!"}
{"text":"Great Gyro.  Service is great too.  It makes a difference when being greeted in a courteous and professional manner."}
{"text":"I love Greco and wish they would open a location in Matthews. When I was living closer to the Wesley chapel location I would go frequently but since moving I am sad to say that I have only been maybe twice. Greco is a great fast casual Greek restaurant with a few locations in south/southeast charlotte.   I usually get the chicken platter which comes with grilled sliced Greek chicken, Greek salad, puts bread, tzatziki, and fries or rice but I think you can get hummus instead. I've also had the grilled chicken Greek traditional salad and chicken pita. In my opinion the platter is the way to go because you get a few different items. I wish that the fries were crispier. Today, I got the lemon oregano fries and while the flavor was there, the crunch was missing. The fries were quite soggy -  I did have maybe 3 that were. I love the feta they use in their salad, sooo good!"}
{"text":"I went here to get a quick bite to eat before football Sunday. Service was good, but the chicken skewers were lacking in flavor. The fries were great. Overall, it was okay, but I'll probably get something else next time."}
{"text":"If you like Greek food, this is the place to go in Union County. The establishment is small, but bright and cheerful. Gyros are this family's favorite and we are never disappointed. The meat is never dry, and the Tzazhiki sauce is freshly made.  The hand cut fries are really good too. Try the spicy ones!  The prices are reasonable too. Oh! And everything except the pitas is GLUTEN FREE!  Go! Have a great meal! Opa!"}
{"text":"Hard to go wrong with anything here.  the Burgers are a fav for sure... and they do something with the fries in addition to the spices that make them fabulous.  Can't think of anywhere in CLT that I have had better fries (no matter what they were cooked in.)  Truth be known... I have gone in there and gotten JUST fries!  They make their own Tzatziki sauce and it's excellent.... especially on the fries. :-)"}
{"text":"What a great place!  Very quick and the gyro was one of the best around. Also try the seasoned fries and baklava.  If your are in the mood for a good quick lunch spot then look no further!"}
{"text":"Such a great place for healthy food! The owner and staff are all so kind and helpful."}
{"text":"Just got back fro Greco Fresh Grille Wesley Chapel and yet again had an awesome Lamb Gyro. 6 bucks and filling. I ask for extra taziki sauce on the side for extra dipping!  perfect lunch.   If you need more at dinner time.....add the seasoned fries and drink to make a combo meal.   If you have not tried them yet.....get up there! You will not be disappointed. Call a head and they will have it ready in 5-10 minutes. i wish they delivered.   Inside is cozy and clean.  Servers are friendly.  Prices are reasonable for the super fresh food they serve.   Have a standard kids menu so parents don't be afraid to bring your kids."}
{"text":"Delicious, fast Greek food. I had the gyro sandwich with fries.  Yummy! I would definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone in the neighborhood looking for a quick and delicious Greek fast food option."}
{"text":"Love this place! My wife and I try to go for lunch every week. Always fresh especially if you order the Greek salad. Also, the restaurant is spotless and the staff is excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ate part of a Falafel Sandwich here today.  The sandwich was dry because it didn't have enough sauce.  But the worst part was the fact that the falafel balls were dry as the clay soil I've been trying to dig through in my garden.  So hard to chew through they were so dry.  I asked for more sauce and they said they had to charge me.   They came around to ask how the meal was and I told them I couldn't eat the falafel balls as they were dry dry dry and the waitress walked off never to be seen again.  So I left half my meal where it was when I left.  Left Unhappy and will never return!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Greek place and everything is fresh. The salads are amazing try the Lahano with chicken."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and the service fast and friendly.  The dolmades are great--give the hummus of the day a try.  The baklava is sweet without being over gooey.  I sampled the spicy fries and they are crisp and not greasy.  This is fast casual food you can feel good about."}
{"text":"Greek perfection! Simple but extremely well done menu. I try not to eat fries, but I make the exception for theirs. We order as take out and enjoy at home."}
{"text":"Delicious, fast, great service and manager. I had the stuffed grapes leaves with the traditional gyro and it was honestly the best meal I've had in the area for under 10$. Highly recommend if you haven't been before!"}
{"text":"One of three now opened by this family. Very moist lamb burger, OK Greek Salad & decent gyros. Hand-cut fries with oregano & lemon were very tasty. Service was top notch & friendly."}
{"text":"Very happy to have this gem open a new location in Wesley Chapel. Lamb and chicken Gyros are to die for!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it has taken me so long to write a review for Greco!...especially considering how often my family eats there! We are either eating in or taking out at least a couple of times a month.   My family and I absolutely love Greco!!  The food is always fresh and delicious, the prices are reasonable, and the service is excellent!   I have, literally, tried everything on the menu and I have enjoyed it all! My go-to is the Peasant salad (I always add Grilled Shrimp and Grilled Chicken). The Lamb Gyros are the best around and their Chicken Kabobs are perfectly marinated and delicious! Their seasoned fries are not to be missed...Lemon & Oregano or Garlic & Cumin on fresh cut French fries...yes, please!!! If you're looking for something sweet, their baklava is outstanding! They also have a kids menu (that includes chicken fingers), burgers (beef or lamb) for the non adventurous types, and almost everything on their menu is Gluten Free.   Just a quick note about their menu...it's not huge, but there is a variety and there's something for everyone. Personally, I prefer a smaller menu and I respect restaurants that keep their menus refined. It shows that they know what their customers want and then they can produce food that is consistently delicious every time.   The restaurant is immaculate!  Every time I am in there they are wiping things down, sweeping floors, or tidying the drink station. The bathrooms are also spotless, which goes a long way with me.   The service is stellar! Everyone is so friendly and they truly go out of their way to ensure a pleasant experience for their customers. Valerie K is the store Manager and she is super sweet and you can tell that she genuinely enjoys working there. Even the teenagers that work there are outgoing and ...get this...they actually greet you with a smile!   I have met the owner (Bill) a couple of times and he's such a nice guy! He's a big supporter of our community. He hosted a \"restaurant night\" for the Cuthbertson HS PTSO last year where he donated a portion of the proceeds from that night's sales to the PTSO. He has done this for several other local schools, too. Gotta love a small business that not only says that they appreciate their community, but they \"show\" it by giving back. Kudus, Bill!  Now I'm hungry and I believe I need a Greco fix for dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"First time here, mezze platter, salad, gyro, baklava. Everything was very good and the baklava was amazing. Service was fast and friendly.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Great gyro! First time visiting and extremely happy. Great service, friendly and fast. Everything tastes so fresh and the cumin garlic seasoning on the fries was delicious!!!!! Getting ready to try the bakalava and ....... WOW!!!! Found a new happy place"}
{"text":"I had the veggie pita. It was ok. The small amount of vegetables in it were a little undercooked, but I still finished it. Definitely \"A-OK,\" but I'm not sure if I'm a fan quite yet."}
{"text":"Store front restaurant with booths and tables in the Greek blue and white colors.  Outdoor tables extend the available seating and it's a good thing since the line for take out and eat in is usually out the door!  I had the platter which included lamb gyro, lemon/oregano fries, and Greek salad. We had the dolmades appetizer delicious and unique, and have had the hummus previously, very creamy and yummy.   $$ very reasonable for authentic Greek food and the service is so fast, especially when you have a lunch hour and have to get back.   The waitstaff is very friendly and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"I really love the food here. I have tried the traditional Gyros, Chicken Gyros and Greek Salad. The French fries are delicious and everything is made to order. I was a little disappointed the last time I had the salad. There were only about 5 small shrimp. They are a little slow on to go orders, so call ahead."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch. Great meal that left us asking ourselves \"Why did we wait so long to try it\"? Clean location and friendly staff. I got the chicken gyro and the wife got the falafel. Both were excellent. We also got the side of tzatziki that was perfectly made. Will most definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Great little place! The prices are reasonable. I love how small and simple it is. The fries are awesome :)"}
{"text":"BEST Mediterranean food ever!! Will definitely be back. Try the Greek salad pita and the roasted red pepper hummus and pita chips!!"}
{"text":"First visit. Came on King day for lunch. Service was great and very friendly. Dinning area seats around 50. The aromas were so good. We ordered humus, lamb gyro and chicken kabob, with lemon oregano fries and salted fries. Food arrived in about 5 minutes. The Rosemary and lemon humus was partnered with great pita bread. Excellent!! The gyro was fabulous as was the kabob. The fries were fresh and tasty. They brought us a sample of the cumin and garlic fries. Don't knock it till you try it. They were all good. Everything seemed so fresh. There was a lot of lunch traffic - another good sign. I can see why they have 2 places with a 3rd almost ready. We shall return!"}
{"text":"His place is a great unique spot for our area. A good mix up from the usual sports bar or Chinese take out. The food is delicious and very fresh tasting. There are a lot of healthy options on the menu which is nice. The service is OK. Not bad not good. Just mediocre.the decor is pretty tacky but it's fine because the  lamb burger makes up for it."}
{"text":"In the area and decided to try out for lunch based on reviews.   Was not disappointed.  Well decorated, very friendly staff.  The food spicy hand cut fries and traditional gyro was the best I have eaten hands down.  Hot and fast.  Very pleasant and refreshing food and service.  The taste was authentic and delicious.   Thank you to the people operating.  Your doing a terrific job."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! Wait staff is awesome and food is even better. I always get the lamb gyro or the salad pita.. Everything is good."}
{"text":"Chicken was not cooked all the way and was chewy.  Manager stood over our table and watched us eat after we told him the chicken was chewy and undercooked."}
{"text":"One of the best gyro platters I've ever had. Affordable, very fresh and delicious!  Don't miss this one."}
{"text":"Chicken gyro with their new chick pea salad.  The chick pea salad is fresh arugula & very thinly sliced red onions with chick peas.  The dressing is very light & tasty.   I took a chicken kabob with pilaf home for dinner.  Once again tasted great."}
{"text":"I enjoy Greco each time I visit.  The prices are a little higher than you would like to pay for a gyro, but the food is always consistent, well portioned (too much normally!) and served with smile!  Service is very friendly and fast - and that makes the added touch!"}
{"text":"This is the best Greek food I have had outside of Astoria (huge Greek neighborhood in Queens, NYC) and some of the best grape leaves I have ever had anywhere,  including in Greek Isles. I always get his Gyro wroth Greek fries.  And they are always very good.   Service is quick and with lots of smiles in this small neighborhood restaurant. The peasant salad is always fresh and the tomatoes just ripe.   All in all a solid food to place."}
