{"text":"I am glad that this overpriced restaurant finally closed. It's an ideal site and I look forward to whatever moves in to replace it."}
{"text":"Being Italian myself I'm always looking for something like my momma used to cook me at home as a kid. This was amazing. To start off the calamari was great and the pizza roll that is about a foot long and all hand made daily was completely epic. Loved the Jerk chicken pasta for dinner and boom! Stuffed and happy. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Stunning bar along river. Vince was an awesome bartender.  Food was excellent!  Interior decor very nice!"}
{"text":"Lunch with several friends and I had the roasted red pepper pasta.  Cavatappi, creamy red pepper sauce with sauteed mushrooms.  Perfectly cooked al dente pasta.  Dying to return for dinner and explore their daunting wine selection.  Vince was the perfect server.  They have a lovely little lounge and coffee area at the front of the restaurant as well.  Such a huge selection of Torani syrup flavors for lattes as well.  Beautiful decor inside.  The owners did a great job with the renovations compared to the sports bar it was before."}
{"text":"Just had a great Chicken Parmesan sandwich. Ate at the bar.  Neil was personable and knowledgable.   Definitely a place to come back too."}
{"text":"Wonderful find!!  The service was spot on! He was fantastic.  You have to try the homemade pizza roll baked as soon as you order it! Delicious.  We ordered the chicken param and tortellini meal. There was nothing left in our plates.  One of the better Italian meals we have had in the cranberry as well as Pittsburgh area. We will surely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Food was good but the service was terrible, it took a lot of effort to get the servers attention, and they never came back unless requested"}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  Horrible. Other than the ambience, there is no reason to go. The bartenders have no concept of wines even though it's a martini wine bar. The food is ridiculously over priced and tastes like it came in frozen. It's 8$+ for a flat 16 oz miller light.  The 7$ add on salads normally come out browned and soaked in dressing to the point of soggy. You can pay 20$ for three cold raviolis though! The service in no better than eat n parks ...\"welcome to asiagos can I start you off with something to drink\", is how your greeted even though it has one of the biggest obnoxious drink menus you'll ever see. The wines are all wines you can find in your local liquor store, they just mark them up by 400%. The place is just so half fast in every aspect. Save your money and go to one of the other good established restaurants down in the north shore."}
{"text":"Would not return here. Food was so-so but the lobster bisque was excellent.  We were there with a large group and individual checks. When the bill arrived my husband was busy so I took care of the check. I made an error with the tip leaving only 10%. It was an honest error. I Aways leave at least 20%. Server walked past my husband and made a snide remark about the tip which I over heard. Looked at my receipt and realized my error. My husband and I made up the difference in cash but the server never apologized for her rudeness. Sorry, but mistakes are made and even if the tip is only 10% the unprofessional behavior is uncalled for."}
{"text":"For the first time in my life, I got food poisoning all because of this place on Jan 30th. I had a pasta dish with chicken and wedding soup. I was horribly sick all weekend and even incurred doctors bills on top of the money I lost on this meal.  Besides the food poisoning, the place is generic Italian with a higher price tag. Definitely many other Italian places downtown that blow this out of the water.  Clearly I'll never return. Please stay away from this place for your health!"}
{"text":"We went here after a baseball game. Not the best italian ever and really really over priced. I got 3 ravioli for like $25, and neon orange asiago (it shouldn't even be orange) dip for like $20. Definetly NOT worth it."}
{"text":"The sign says Tuscan Cuisine, but it really isn't very Tuscan. They brought me some \"Faccacio bread\", but it was far too soft and gaumy to be Faccacio. The \"dipping sauce\" was oil with sun dried tomato, not olive oil as you would find in your usual Italian restaurant. After talking with the waitress I ordered the Wild Mushroom Ravioli with steak tips. It cam with far too much cheese sauce and was more lava than ravioli. Even the glass of Sangiovese wasn't that great. Maybe I am too picky being Italian and having been to Tuscany over a dozen times. I imagine some would like the style but not me."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, and definitely the best Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh. The food was hot and delicious (I highly recommend the eggplant Parmesan), the salads were fresh, and the service was excellent. I'd like to see a lunch menu offered, but cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty mediocre. We went on a Sunday evening... we were the only two people in the restaurant except for another couple, so no complaints on service. The food is a different story... The lobster bisque was okay, I wouldn't order it again though. Also, I wouldn't recommend the crab alfredo. The sauce tasted very generic, def not something they make onsite, and the crab meat was non-existent. The waitress added some to my to-go container after I said I was finished with my meal however she didn't offer to fix the problem while I was eating it. On a positive note, the crab dip was pretty good. Unlike my pasta, it had plenty of crab meat! The bill was $70 for an app, a cup of bisque and two entrees... reasonable but not worth it!"}
{"text":"Food: Haven't had a dish I don't like yet! But, do ask if you have issues with ingredients. I was told by one wait staff that the meatballs were all beef and told by another they were not. Get clear info if you have adversions. Love the eggplant dishes and the flatbread is outstanding!  Atmosphere: Lovely! Great outdoor seating. Spacious restaurant with 2 bars.  Reservations: Easy to work with.  Parking: Stinks. They don't have valet often. When they do, it's $7. You have to pay event rates to park close to the restaurant. It is not an easy walk from non-event parking areas. This is a big issue for us wanting to eat there when we are NOT going to an event; like the last 2 times we were there."}
{"text":"This was a nice little Italian place.... The atmosphere was Dark and romantic with candles at each table and cozy booth seating. I do feel like the menu was very overpriced for the quality of ingredients provided.   Everything we ordered was prepared well, but as others have said, the dishes had little flavor... especially the Alfredo. I do have very high expectations for Alfredo at an Italian place!   The bread & dip provided at the beginning of the meal was fantastic. I also had their bruschetta which was not at all a typical recipe. They prepared it with a cold balsamic vinegar and red onion topping that was unexpected but yummy. Overall I would return if the prices were slightly lowered."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night for dinner before seeing a show at Stage AE.  Things seemed off the moment my friends and I hit the door.  It started with the front waiting area, which obscures the rest of the restaurant.  We had to wait awhile for a host or hostess to even come up there to acknowledge us for one.  Then, when we were lead to a table, the place seemed pretty slow for a Saturday night. Then there were these mildly uncomfortable, awkward chairs that were too...well, thick?  As in, the actual seat part of it was so thick and heavy that it was hard to scoot yourself up to the table with either the momentum of your body, or the use of your hands because you couldn't physically reach down to grip the bottom of your chair.  (I barely could, and I'm 5'10\", for height reference.) Other than that, the food was really just okay, and I can't say the service was memorable.  Not bad, just not standout good either. Maybe it was an off night.  I don't feel like I'll ever seek out a return trip, but I would be willing to give it another chance if someone just had to take me...and pay for it..."}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow! Super delicious! I'll have to visit this place again! You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Just happened to stop in here before the game since everything else was crazy crowded (of course). This place was definitely busy, but not out of control like the other spots.   I only had appetizers but thought they were great. The Bubble Bread especially.   Overall, the service was friendly and the atmosphere was nice. The food did take a little while but nothing crazy, and the waiter was attentive."}
{"text":"Okay let's start by saying I read the reviews.  We went anyway.. The food was delicious ! We LOVED the bartender Alex!! Very knowledgeable on food product and customer service! He invented a drink the BLOOD ORANGE JALAPEÃ‘O margarita ask for that, it took a while to make, but it was delicious!  The server although very nice was NOT knowledgable or refined!  Pulling out a paper to read the specials , wiping her nose at tables with her ... Wrist !! Her announcement to the table as to what was ordered .. All classic moves that will help this restaurant to meet its demise ! Great concept .. Beautiful bar , poor execution!  Alex tried hard to get us to come back - provided improvements are made would entertain the idea but only at the bar with Alex serving us!"}
{"text":"In town on business- table for one!  One of the few places where everything on the menu looked interesting.  I opted for apps, soup and salad. Timing of food was perfect, waiter was friendly and bill was not too big. What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Staff was great. Atmosphere nice. Eggplant Rollatini very good. Crab fettuccini Alfredo good. Bread and oil very good. White white glasses bad. I hope this restaurant has more success than the previous tenant in this location."}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant as a result on not being able to get in somewhere else. It was not crowded and did not wait for a seat (it was about 3pm on a Saturday). We had two little kids with us, and while our server was generally nice, she seemed to be 'out of it'.  We asked several questions about drinks and meals (mostly for the kids) and just got a weird stare. The food, specifically the Greek salad with chicken left much to be desired. The greens were ok, but the chicken was chewy and rubbery. We sat outside because it was a beautiful day, and there was a man standing at the host station. He glared at us the entire time. It was not just me who noticed this. It made me uncomfortable, the kids were not misbehaving at all, so I honestly couldn't figure out the problem here. Perhaps it was just an off day for this place, but i will unlikely visit here again."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant! Excellent food and service. Loved the Asian sirloin tips and the peanut butter pie. Valet parking was also convenient given our current frigid temperatures! The restaurant is only two months old. Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"Had the pistachio salmon salad for lunch. Salmon cooked perfectly. I could eat this dish every day! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"BEWARE! This restaurant does not open at 11 as it says everywhere online.Got there and they said they may open at 5 or maybe in a half hour. My family paid 15 bucks to park we got there and they were closed on a Saturday afternoon. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"A group of us ate here for the first time the other day. There were 6 of us and all had something different. I would say 2 out of the 6 had some issue with their meal. The other 4 said everything was really good. I had the Greek salad with chicken. The chicken was clean and cooked very nice. The salad though was very bland. I also had the French onion soup which I felt was a bit salty, heavy beef broth, soggy crouton, and basically a slice of cheese. So I wouldn't order either of those again. However my wife got the ravioli with gorgonzola sauce and it was really good.   I would definitely go back and try something else. The decor is really nice and has a nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great food and great environment. The restaurant is very nice but I think the tv's playing sports at the bar take away from how nice it really is. I highly doubt people are going here to pay for expensive drinks to watch a steelers game.   As for the food...it was amazing. The bruschetta had a very good taste and the toast was toasted perfectly. I get nervous ordering bruschetta because some places toast the bread too much and you risk chipping a tooth. As my main course I got the Mediterranean pasta with scallops. It was even better then it sounds. The sauce had so much flavor but the lemon flavor wasn't overpowering.   I will say that the prices and portions are slightly weird. My friend got the eggplant Parmesan and her plate looked like she had half a box of angel hair and an entire eggplant on her plate. My meal was much smaller in comparison. The appetizer prices were also very pricey which made us hesitant to get one at first."}
{"text":"Food was great, portion sizes are weird. My dish was a good portion my friends were kind of small for 22 dollars. BE AWARE: the menu listed on Yelp has incorrect prices. I read over the menu before going thinking to spend 30 bucks for my date and I. The total was 58 dollars excluding the tip. If you're planning to go here just know you'll be spending a decent amount especially if you're drinking. As far as the prices go, it's a bit expensive. If I'm spending 20 bucks on a pasta dish I think a salad or soup should be included. I'd go back to this place, it was a comfortable atmosphere and nice staff."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came down from Buffalo for a girls weekend trip. We were looking forward to a good dinner before we go out and explore Pittsburgh for the first time and when we arrived to the restaurant at 6:30 the two meals we wanted to order were already out (lobster ravioli and tortellini.) We both ordered the Tortelluchi which comes with chicken. The dish comes out and we both noticed right away that it didn't have chicken. The waiter takes it back and after a few mins it comes out with the chicken. We cut into the chicken and the chicken was RAW!!! Mine was just border line under cooked. They take hers back and did not charge us but I was already freaked out by her having the raw chicken that I couldn't finish my dish. We told the waiter that were just unhappy and he got upset and told us to just leave if you're unhappy. We said that we'll just pay for he app because that was good and you could tell that he was upset and flustered by the whole thing, that he just slammed the bill and walked away. We spoke with the manager and just left. Totally unacceptable for a \"pretty epic\" rating here!!!!"}
{"text":"Really delicious food!  We went before a Pirates game on a Saturday night and stunned that we could get outdoor seating and service while still making it to the game before the first pitch.  Our guests said the Salmon salad was the best they'd ever had!  I had the meatballs with angel hair pasta and could have it everyday.  So classically yummy!"}
{"text":"Went with the good reviews...Alex is the real deal! Best bartender ever! Can't beat their pesto chicken flatbread...amazing!! Stop in even if only just for drinks with Alex:-) You won't be disappointed. Tell him the other yelp fans sent you!"}
{"text":"We went for Mother's Day lunch.  The food was very good and reasonably priced- this is a great addition to the north shore!  I lowered my star rating because the service was really really slow. The restaurant was not very busy and our waiter made himself scarce after he realized we weren't drinking. We waited about 20 min for our check until a  different waiter (an older guy who was hustling his butt off) had to go get our waiter for us. It took us another 15-20 min to get moving."}
{"text":"Came here for carb loading prior to running the Pittsburgh Half Marathon and had an enjoyable time.  Service was friendly and efficient.  Brittany was terrific. The corner booth they sat us in was nice but it was right under a vent so that was not cool.  Well actually it was cool because we had cold air blowing right on us the entire meal.  The food was okay.  I had the penne vodka and it was alright but the cheese sauce looked unnaturally orange.    The pizza roll was outstanding, though.  I highly recommend that.  And the olive oil and sun dried tomato dipping sauce was excellent as well.  Overall, this is a nice place, but I think the food is a little pricey for what you get.  However, it can defintely accommodate large parties and I don't think anyone would go home hungry."}
{"text":"What a wonderful new addition to the north shore.  Definitely not bar food.  Very upscale.    We had the corn meal dusted calamari, Caesar salad and mushroom ravioli with sirloin tips.  Everything was wonderful.  Bar environment boasts excellent selection of wines along a full bar compliment.  Wonderful ambiance."}
