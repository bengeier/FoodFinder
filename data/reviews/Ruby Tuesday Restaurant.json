{"text":"This Ruby Tuesday is nicer than most.  There were wine glasses on the tables at lunch and the more upscale furnishings and booths made me wish I was wearing a blazer.  But service was friendly and lively as usual.  

Our host ended up being our waiter which made me wonder if they were short staffed.  But  he never let our drinks run out.  And he apologized when my sandwich came out with cheese on it by mistake.  It's a big sign of competency and integrity to me when they recognize something wasn't exactly the way you wanted it and offer to correct it.  So I like them. 

The Morrocroft Village shopping center where this is located looks a little stuffy, like the central hub of a college campus.  But it's easy walking distance from the restaurant to the Border's and Starbucks.  Which makes it a nice place for a relaxing, albeit corporate, afternoon of shopping and chilling out.  It was 32 degrees out so we were happy."}

{"text":"This was the first ever Ruby Tuesday's I ever ate at. The service is what impressed me the most although the food was very good. I don't like having a waitress or waiter just hanging around and every time I take a bite of food they come and ask \"how is everything\". Now it's very rude to spit out your food just to say, \"can't you see I'm trying to eat\"? 

Here at this place they didn't come around every 5 min., but they were always there to fill up my coffee cup and water glass. 

Sure wish there was a RT here in Modesto."}
{"text":"I love the croutons here, it's strange to be obsessed with such a minor part of a salad, but these have the best consistency!  I could tell that they weren't the pre-packaged kind; these are made from bread crumbs in the kitchen.  I can honestly just grab a plate of croutons and ranch dressing and go to town.  That's quite enough info on the croutons, but damn you will understand when you eat them.  The veggie burger here is pretty tasty too, it isn't one of those frozen Morningstar burgers; it is pretty plump and wholesome.  I have always had good service from these lively folks and I need to go back and eat more croutons.  I am salivating right now."}
{"text":"Another Ruby Tuesday's. Like McDonald's, Ruby's has a formula and they execute it right down to the letter including my favorite semi-crunchy pumpernickel croutons on the salad bar.

Burgers, burgers, burgers, all are with their overly salted \"bottomless fries\" which I'm sure is designed to make you drink more. Since I'm usually on the H20, this doesn't translate into a higher booze bill. They do have other entrees, but I've never strayed from the burgers. I wonder if anyone actually comes here and has the ribs??

Salad bar! Refillable! Excellent stuff! It's usually very well cared for and stocked. Even during the busiest hours, it is rare to find something out.

It's casual dining with a very full selection at the bar. Would I come here again? Sure. Consistency is nice sometimes. I can't find a thing wrong to say about the place, but it's just not a \"five stars\" restaurant."}
