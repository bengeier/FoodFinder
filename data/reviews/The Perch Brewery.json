{"text":"The Perch......... Love the restaurant outdoor patio and listening to the birds.I had a good bacon burger as well. The service was quick and our waiter kept the tea coming.I would recommend for meeting a friend for lunch great place."}
{"text":"The service was awesome. The server was very helful. He gave me great ideas of drinks/beers to try. We sat on the roof. They had live music that actually wasn't half bad. The place is simply cool. The bird cages are cool and a bit different from your average decor. I'm glad I stumbled upon this place. It isn't very easy to find. It's off this random alley. Tons of parking though. Great Vibe."}
{"text":"Love the potential this place has, but they still have a lot kinks to work out. We sat on the patio, which was very relaxing, but it took about 10 min to have our table cleaned and drink orders taken. Our waitress was very sweet, but very uneducated about the beers and what beers were actually available. Menu was very limited, so we tried their gourmet beer sausage with 3 dipping sauces. Wasn't that tasty, there was a strong seasoning or herb that was very overpowering. Plus, it came out lukewarm. Definitely wasn't worth the steep price... Overall, it's a great atmosphere behind a great concept and I will definitely be back, but I'll give it another month or 2 before returning. I'm a huge fan of local breweries, so I'm looking forward to trying their own house brews."}
{"text":"I've been here about four times and it just keeps getting worse. The atmosphere is awesome, rooftop bar really cool! The food is ok. Beer selection is ok. Attitude SUCKS!!! 

I'm ok with the fact that it's a cool trendy thing to do to require employees to have the hipster beards and backwards hats but it just seems like this place has so much more potential than that. That's beside the point though. The service and the attitude of the service staff is just horrendous! Here's the skinny:

My girlfriend had ordered a vodka cherry press the last visit only to find they had just ran out of cherry flavored vodka. No big deal, switch to sangria. This trip, she orders the same thing with the same results. I said, \"Wow, they were out of it last time too!\"
Trendy hipster beard with attitude says, \"Well, we ARE a brewery you know?\"

I was surprised to hear that and thought to myself, \"What's up with the full bar with wine and spirits then!?\"

Oh well, our hipster server informed us that he was the brewmaster and whatever blah blah. We quickly lost what little interest we had left in this place. I will not be back. No thank you, your beer is horrible, your attitude is worse and I'd rather spend my money at a real brewery.  Having said that, avoid this at all costs and try Four Peaks or SanTan instead!"}
{"text":"HEAT WARNING, BEWARE!! This was my first visit to The Perch. On a day well over 100, we didn't think we would want to sit outside. So we opted for an inside table by the bar. As soon as we walked through the door, we could tell it was very warm inside. The only air circulating were a few small fans on the ceiling and they were not helpful. I could see air-conditioning vents or swamp cooler vents, but apparently they were not turned on . Then I was served my beer, and this is what the waiter said. \"Here's a warm glass with a cold beer\". (beer was in a can).  Didn't think that helped the cause. There was never an explanation of why it was so hot in there or an apology.  The ice in our water glasses melted so the water was hot, the beers weren't that cold either.  We debated if we wanted to stay and order food, we did. We we had an order of garlic, herb tater tot's with goat cheese on the top, very, very good.  The large order is way too big for four people. We also ordered fish and chips, a grilled cheese, a macaroni and cheese, and a grilled shrimp salad. The fish and chips and grilled cheese came with tater tot's, so that's probably the reason why we didn't eat all of our tot's. The food was very good. I would totally recommend this place during the winter. As we left there was a ton of birds making all kinds of noise, not sure if I would ever sit outside with all that racket. It's kind of hard to find, the street is very small basically an alley . The parking lot is not so plentiful. Judge for yourself, go over there and see if you like it. Just not in the summer!! 

*Owners!! Get your AC fixed, this is AZ!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and really like it. I love the outside patio, but it's better suited for cooler weather as is the rooftop deck. The rescued bird are fun to look at, although there are a couple of the bigger ones that can get quite noisy, but hey...it's there home and we're visiting it! 

Food: I've had their Prime Dip, which was very good although I'm not sure the pretzel bun is the best choice, but still good. The wings are very good, slightly spicy, but very flavorful. The fish tacos are also a good choice as is the citrus shrimp salad (large shrimp on top!). I have not tried the brick oven tamale, but my friend did and said it was excellent, it is however HUGE and you could easily share it! Appetizers: the meat and cheese board YUM and the pretzels are wonderful (who doesn't like beer cheese to dip in??) I've not tried the pulled pork sliders, but they look amazing (3 good size sliders, so you could have it as your meal). 

They have a great selection of beer, some their own brews, but also many other local beers. 

When busy the service can be a bit slow and the kitchen can be very slow, so that's really the only reason I can't give a 5 star. Overall a very cool place to hang out and enjoy our weather!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service! This was our first time here and I was appalled by the horrific service we encountered. Our 15 person group sat in the bar area on a decently crowded Friday evening. My mother and her friends had been in the bar area an hour prior to my arrival and expressed the same distaste with the server's attitude and lack of service. I was at our table for about 15 minutes before she even came to see if anyone wanted to order a drink. She was passing by our table and we had to ask if we could order something to get her to stop and assist. She took only my drink order and then rushed away before anyone else could voice what they had wanted. My mother and myself tried to catch her attention by attempting to call her back over. She ignored our efforts and finally screamed back \"I heard you and will come back when I'm ready\" across the restaurant in a very rude and unprofessional manor. We watched her place my drink order and then proceed to help several other tables without even coming back to finish our order. My mother had to go up to the bar and let her know that we were waiting to place several other drink orders, to which she responded that she was busy and will get back to us when she felt like it. Appalled, my mom walked back to our table and we sat for another 10 minutes before our single drink was even delivered or we were assisted again. 

Our waitress never came back to check on us once our drinks were empty and we were ready for another round. We had to flag her down again to order and once again waited for a while before anything was delivered. On my final drink order, I watched my beer sit at the bar for nearly 15 min. Our waitress passed by several times and proceeded to neglect us, help her other tables, and chat with her friends behind the bar. It got to the point where I stood up myself and grabbed my own beer at the bar. At this point, I was fed up with this snotty waitress' terrible service and took matters into my own hands. I asked to speak with the manager; he was just as nonchalant and could care less that his waitress was incompetent of doing her job. He listened to my concern and only offered to find our server to close out our tab. I simply handed him my card, annoyed by his inconsiderate response, and asked him to just close me out. Once sat down, our waitress appeared (the quickest I had seen her move since our arrival) and tossed my credit card at me, informing me the manager had comped my beer. She continued her disrespectful behavior throughout the evening, \"coincidentally\" bumping into our friends and rudely walking between people conversing at table.

We were all appalled by this bitchy behavior and will never return to this poor excuse for an establishment. Not only was this waitress incompetent of doing her job, or any job for that manor, I could not believe that the manager could care less about the rude demeanor his staff was giving off. I have worked in the restaurant and customer service industry for nearly 9 years and have never experienced behavior of this manor. Unless you wanted to be treated like shit for mediocre food and warm (because they take forever to come) drinks, steer clear of this place!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like it.  The beer is good and the ambience is nice with the green courtyard.  The food though, average at best.

We had the pig wings.  These were half cremated in their char grill.  The fat in the pork of course made them edible but that could have been a lot better.  The arepas........please.  Think less of an Andean flavor sensation and instead think of yesterday's McDonalds breakfast sandwich muffin with some flavorless pork in between.  More like a chewy slider.  

The lobster wontons may have had some lobster hidden in the cheese sauce somewhere.  Perhaps a trace.  Without advanced analytical techniques we will never know.

Nice staff.  Nice setting and to be fair we were late getting there and only on the appetizers."}
{"text":"Good vibe, we even went with four children on an early Saturday afternoon. Esme and Ronn L were our wait staff and they were both awesome people. Super friendly and we're very honest about their beer and food recommendations. Enjoyed the birds, although it wasn't exactly what I expected when I read about this place. Just kind of a bunch of birds in cages. Nothing too crazy. Had the tots and they were fresh and super tasty. Then went for it with the perch burger and I'm glad I did. Super flavorful! Hubby got jalapeño marmalade wings and was in heaven! Coffee porter and the black IPA are on point too!"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this review 2 stars is because the environment was cool.  The service was HORRIBLE, food was served cold, and wrong, lacking flavor. I really was excited to eat here, but now I can't wait to leave this wobbly table on the hill that they sat us on. This place has potential if management would step in and hire decent servers."}
{"text":"This a unique place to be sure. Any place can offer craft beers and a patio, but how about an exotic bird sacturary? The patio is nicely shaded with trees and plants with the main bar and inside seating looking on to them through three open garage doors. There are cages containing all sorts of parrots, cockatoos and the like.

The friendly staff greeted us, including the Sous Chef Rob, who took some time to explain the newly printed menu. We followed his recommendation for the mains after we enjoyed a plate of jalapeño marmalade flavoured wings with a blue cheese dip. I have never had a blue cheese dip with actual chunks of blue cheese! Awesome! 

Mains were green chili and pork pizza and Mac and Cheese topped with fried chicken and green chilies.
The flavours: 

The wings were excellent - a nice touch of heat following the slightly smokey flavour. Pizza was generously topped with shredded pork having a very nice finish with the green chili.  While I only had a bite of the fried chicken, it was crisp and full of flavour.

Tried two ales: Rosemary IPA and Rye You So Mad Bro.  The \"Bro\" was my pick and it seemed to compliment the pizza. My dining buddy had a peach ale that was also very good.

I imagine this place would be awesome on a weekend! Will have to make it back again!"}
{"text":"First time visit for the wife and I. We absolutely enjoyed the upstair veranda while waiting for our eventual table downstairs. Service was prompt and quick. They have a great selection of unique beers, some brewed on the property. You have to try the schofferhoffer beer! Guarantee you will like it- it's unique and a good shift from the wheat tasting beers. We ordered the meat and cheese platter- perfect for us as we were not hungry to try the full menu. Prices were reasonable. We will go back!!  Try this place, I think you'll like it."}
{"text":"Went for brunch with three girl friends 9/26. This was our second time there and we were hoping the terrible service last time was just a fluke but unfortunately it wasn't. Don't bother asking for egg whites because they don't offer them. Really?$ it's 2015.., buy a carton of egg whites. Our waiter forgot to put in one of our orders so I got to watch my friends eat while I waited for my full fat frittata. When I did finally get it it was greasy and not flavorful either. There were lots of other small things but it's not worth the energy to write about. Skip food and go right to drinking only here."}
{"text":"The food was really good! We were a party of 7, and between all of us we got a variety of things off of the menu.  All of them were super good! My favorites were the goat chess tater tots and the brussels sprout pizza. There is both outdoor and indoor seating, as well as a roof top bar.  My favorite part, besides the food, was the variety of birds.  The love birds were really cute and the parrots were gorgeous.  Overall a really cool restaurant that we will be back at!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to the Perch yet, definitely check it out!! Ignore my rating. 
Get the Pig Wings! Fantastic. 

I really want to give the Perch five stars, but just can't. The last two times, in two weeks, we've been there they just haven't executed. 

The last time we were there, I know this is small, but we got the Meat and Cheese board, and everything was great, except ....the meats were just plain sandwich meats!! Turkey and salami. Really?? For $22...

This time, first, our server came came around maybe every 10 minutes... And it felt we were waiting forever. It was not a busy night. 
Second, we got our food and two of the plates were luke warm. The burger was hot, but the Mac and Cheese and Duck Ruben were both disappointing because if the temp. I was so excited for the duck, but it really was not great. 

The Perch is awesome, but I'm really sad that the last two times have not been 100%, cause I really think the staff can pull it off."}
{"text":"I went on Saturday night and experienced much of the same. I am a local patron of \"The DC\" and love to give my business to downtown chandler area. I think that the Perch has a good thing going, great concept, love the look and vibe, love all the beer options...absolutely needs improvement...primarily in the service area. After waiting over an hour for a hostess to seat us, we walked upstairs and watched people self seating...told the hostess she just shrugged. We eventually seated ourselves.Our waiter, Ray, hovered for 20 min asking if we wanted anything and then when we had decided and we were ready to order he told us he could get our food, but not our hard alcohol because he would have walk downstairs..is that not his job or is that the guest's job? Brandon at the bar downstairs, when I walked down and got my own drink, did apologize...

My suggestions would be:

-- take a good look at your staff and weed out the ones that are not representative of who you want your business to be. You have good and bad...get the bad ones out so you can be great!

--Get your hostesses walky-talkies and put one hostess at the front podium, one at the top of the stairs, and one to walk people to their seat or to the hostess at the top of the stairs. It will allow for organized seating and less frustrated patrons and the walky talkies will allow them to communicate open seating without leaving their post.

--Food can be improved...look at some successful similar businesses in the area: vintage 95, the living room, postino's east...keep it simple, good and reasonably priced.

--Also, get hard alcohol and more beer upstairs and with what is being offered...be sure it is cold!!!

To the owner, all of us that post on yelp do it in order to have a good experience, if you look at our posts we give props where they are due. I will absolutely try you again down the road and if you are good...will give you props. More than my bad experience, I am sad to see you slam people back. Most of them would likely try you again down the road, but you have slammed them so bad instead of taking the criticism constructively and working to improve their next experience. Perhaps next time, just say, Hey it was a soft opening, we are working through the kinks, we appreciate your feedback and will use it to improve our patrons experience. We hope you will come again and see that we have improved. 

Just acknowledge that they had a bad experience, just you showing appreciation to the feedback (positive or negative) and that you are willing to grow from it will get them to come back, slamming them will only make them think you are part of the problem. I will try you again, I hope that you take the feedback positively and perhaps I will have a better experience next time."}
{"text":"So.. where to start. First time here we brought my sister who was visiting. We were not able to sit outside although there were many tables open. Hostess said we could sit upstairs at the bar. We get up there and actual bar is full and everywhere else you could sit is for lounging, no tables to eat at. Back downstairs.
We were sat in a corner by the indoor bar downstairs, behind a door. At a table that wobbled. That did not deter us. Rather, it was the fact that the entire bar area seemed to only have one server handling tables. Sigh.
Our server was amazing. We watched him juggle a dozen tables and he was very helpful and friendly in spite of this. The two stars are for him. Otherwise this review would be zero stars. 
I ordered the tamale breakfast, which took about 30-40 min to arrive. Okay, it's busy. The issue is that what they are calling a \"tamale\" is just a flat square of masa,  layered with meat of your choice, cheese, eggs and sauce. It arrived cold for whatever reason. Gross. 
No one seemed to be helping our server so we waited each time we needed something (refill, check, to go box, etc). And waited. The rating here is for the food, wait, and lack of organization. Needs more staff, more seating with tables if you're going to open the upstairs bar for brunch.
loved the beautiful birds but will probably not be back to dine in. My sister liked her \"brizza\" aka breakfast pizza so we may try the pizza to go and give it another go."}
{"text":"This place has become my go to bar. 
They were quite brilliant building this little gem. A cute little sanctuary, full of trees and exotic birds; who wouldn't love it!?
I love the employees, laid back and great to talk to. Always happy and ready to help make you feel comfortable. 
Their beer is incredible! I don't exactly like how often they switch their home brews, because they won't always have what you ordered last time you came in, but I'm never disappointed when trying their new selection. Can't emphasize enough how much I love their beer."}
{"text":"Tried this place again, during the weekday...like 3:30pm.  Met my husband, who had just dropped off him motorcycle at a place nearby.  Once again, the thing I ordered they were out of.  This time it was a simply vodka and cranberry. The only thing they had was flavored vodka...I tried it and it was not good...  :(  It was light too, and all that furniture upstairs is dirty. Gross."}
{"text":"I really liked the food and greenery.But what worried me the whole time was the birds in the cage so close to each other with hardly any space to move leave alone fly.That was nt a great sight atleast for me."}
{"text":"My experience has been consistently a five star leading up to tonight. Being outdoors, there is certainly a high likelihood of encountering random bugs. I'm not particularly familiar with the local insect wildlife in this area, however, our double date encountered a large insect collectively identified as a large cockroach. Upon the reaction of the server and requested response of the manager, this was not an unusual situation. No courtesy or gratuitive gesture was offered in regards to this. To top it off, our server accidentally added two beers to our bill. Again, I reluctantly spoke to the same manager, who treated the situation as though it was an honest mistake; which I'll give the benefit of the doubt. Despite the series of unfortunate circumstances during my experience as a patron, the manager's lack of consideration has set the tone for my future recommendations and likelihood of returning.
I'm a tough critic, yes, however it isn't too much to expect professionalism in an environment that seemingly supports that type of culture. 
Advice to owner: Have better internal controls and promote individuals that are more interpersonally savvy.

Best of luck to the Perch. It's a cool place, but it's slippin' in service."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and ambience are \"top shelf\", just like the rooftop bar, especially when it's not super hot.  They have recently added a separate seating area with a huge protector TV for a group party.  This is a unique place.

I did find that the food menu was a little limited and had mostly fried food.  But, it is a bar / microbrewery after all, first and foremost."}
{"text":"I had heard so many good things about this place from friends, but ended up being disappointed. Today was my first experience. Normally I give a place a few chances before writing a review, but this was ridiculous. 
The atmosphere is cool. The beer, at least the one I got to try was great. I would have ordered more if the server was on top of things.
The food was okay. But our service was so horrible. I can normally give the benefit of the doubt if the place was busy, but it was not. My husband and I arrived at 4pm on purpose to avoid the potential dinner crowd. 
It took forever for our male server to acknowledge our table. We got our beers and water right away when we were finally able to order. But our appetizers and regular food came out at the exact same time, which tells me he was inexperienced or there is a kitchen problem. He checked in once midway through eating. When my husband asked for the check, the server didn't even bother asking if we would like any more water or needed a box for our leftover food. Once the server finally got around to running the card he just dropped off the check and walked away even though my husband was mid sentence asking for water. 
Needless to say I don't think either one of us will be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in downtown Chandler for any occasion. Weekend brunch, lunch, date night.. Always a great time. Good food, great beer, and even better service."}
{"text":"Three words. Beer cheese soup. Throw some tater tots in it. Awesome! All the food here is good. Great beer too."}
{"text":"The waitress totally ignored us, served the appetizer after the entree, when we said we didn't like it... she didn't seem to care"}
{"text":"One star or less...apparently EVERY table, inside or outside, is server appointed. Do not sit anywhere unless you are told to sit. I am assured, I will not return and this is clearly on the servers and hostesses as their own unwritten rule. The beers are okay, the guest taps are good. Go somewhere else if you want friendly service for EVERYONE."}
{"text":"Went to happy hour after work a week or so ago.  Great environment and service (thanks Carl!).  I had one of the their micro brew ales - it was hoppy and good.  The wings were great and what a deal on the pizza (that was also delicious).  Can't wait to bring my wife here!"}
{"text":"Waiter was ok.  Only checked on us once, which I'm assuming was because he knew the kitchen was in error !!!  It took 37 minutes for 2 orders of Chicken Tacos.  Overall Bad Experience and Food was Average at Best !!!  Sadly Disappointed !!!  Also, manager was AWARE of the time it took for our food and NO discount was offered or applied !!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great beer, food & atmosphere. Outdoor patio, rescued birds, trees for shade. Your bartender Deandra is awesome. Drew was a great host and gave us a tour. This is my new favorite place. Keep it up."}
{"text":"WILL NEVER GO AGAIN, HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT. The place had a nice atmosphere and looked really cool. It's a shame the management was HORRIBLE and very rude.
Our waiter skinny short red-blonde hair was extremely dull and it was like talking to a wall. We ordered a Jar of Sangria for $12 Cuz it came in a neat Mason Jar. We specifically asked if we could keep it and he told us yes. So we got excited and got that. The night kept getting later so ud think around 11 ish it'd get busy. Nope dead as hell. We were there til 1 and done drinking around 12 but before we could leave 2 things happened. 
1st at 12:45 they let this group in with an older lady who was soooo wasted she had to be carried. Why? They put her in a seat and she fell backwards and hit her head. I think they even served this poor lady.
2nd The manager came and asked where his Mason Jar was!! Dude are u kidding me?? We specifically asked our dull waiter if we could keep the jar and he said yes. He said oh no way. I don't have an endless supply of Mason Jars.
If your an establishment A, customer is ALWAYS right, or apologize for misunderstanding don't be rude and make a scene. B. A Mason Jar really?!?! One u can buy for .50 at the store, youre a bar in a popular area and u are counting pennies like that?!?! I believe ur bar is hurting and see why it was very dead from 11-1. The taller skinny manager with glasses is a prick.
The bar didn't have anything special where'd I'd choose it over any other one close by. I will remember that and will make sure everyone at BofA ML knows of this too!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here on a Saturday afternoon to celebrate my last day of work. The atmosphere is great. I love the Upstairs bar area but the service is HORRENDOUS! They clearly do not care about their guest. Every server/hosted experience felt like we were a burden on them. After dinner we went upstairs to have a drink and unfortunately had the same experience there too. The waitress was very rude and clearly upset that we were only planning on ordering one drink, which took 30 minutes to get to us. She never came back as we were \"wasting her time.\" 

I'll give this place one more try because I have heard better things about it but I was very disappointed that I chose this place to celebrate a special occasion and that was ruined by their service. So Beware!"}
{"text":"Really cool place to hangout in downtown Chandler. Most of their seating is outside which I am really excited about when it cools down. The atmosphere is really cool, they have a lot of rescue birds in cages hanging around and lots of shade."}
{"text":"Waiters have been consistently good. Food & drinks are great. Only complaint is hostess station. Every visit they've been slow, rude or a combination of both. Not a good way to start the experience."}
{"text":"Adorable little spot that is great for a little day drinking. Lunch menu is a bit limited but food is decent. Comfortable atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"This place was pretty cool. I felt like it just went on forever and each time I turned a corner there was something new to see. I really liked the concept, but what won me over was the food! We showed up on a Saturday night and the place was pretty packed, so we went upstairs and had a drink while we waited. Our table was ready pretty quick and our server was nice and attentive. My grilled cheese sandwich was out of this world! I cannot wait to go back and eat there again!"}
{"text":"My favorite weekend brunch,  with in house brewed beer and house made dishes,  weekends are best at The Perch.  My favorite is the open skillet tamale with carnitas with the \"huevos percheros\" a close 2nd. In house cilantro lime tortillas with beans and overeasy eggs with pico and guacamole. The breakfast burger is great for those who like lunch for breakfast. I used to love the biscuits and gravy but think the biscuit has gotten too big since I prefer more gravy than biscuit."}
{"text":"This is a cool place, I sat on the roof!  Great music, the pizza was fantastic, and they had a great beer selection.  There are birds everywhere, and the service was fast.  I will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here, the food is good and the beer is excellent! There is approximately 20 of their beers on tap plus many more to choose from!"}
{"text":"Wonderful sanctuary in downtown Chandler! Rooftop bar is quaint. Downstairs bar is unique with a beautiful bartop. The birds are a delightful distraction. First time my boyfriend and I went, we had a little trouble finding it. But with some persistence we got there. Well worth the trouble. We ended up on the roof for some Sunday brunch and bloody marys. They were very busy, but the service was great. There were 2 very funny and attentive guys helping about 45 people. A Sergio and Mikey moved like gazelles through a crowded rooftop with grace and glee. Honestly, if it wasn't for their antics and attention we would've been worried about the ratio of employees to customers. Sergio is too short to reach the taps so Mikey has to pour all the beers. But we had a wonderful time and we recommend this place to any and all!!"}
{"text":"Best atmosphere in Chandler since El Zocalo. Have to wait for a table?  No problem, Bam!  $30,000 worth of exotic birds to look at. Some of the Amazon Parrots even speak (just don't for the love of God stick your finger inside their cadges.) Great service from bartender upstairs, as our friends slowly gathered, great service from the upstairs wait staff. Oyster shooters were ice cold, fresh and trustworthy, and not to be missed!  Once downstairs for dinner, we had prompt and even enthusiastic service from wait staff. They smoke all their meats, their kitchen is in full view from outside. This is a destination restaurant that's surely the envy of many in old town Scottsdale. Go!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's the service, not the food.  The food is quite tasty, and the atmosphere is great. But the quality of service is less than acceptable, and don't even think about booking a larger party.  We had a wonderful first lunch there on a weekday, and because we didn't have any place to go, we didn't mind the slow service.  The tater tots, wings, and salads were great (their beer is pretty blah and flat, we tried a flight).  So I decided maybe a birthday party with 15 friends would be great there, maybe on the roof? We were told the roof was open Wed-Sun, so I called to confirm, since party was a Tues.  no, I'm told, roof IS open Tuesday, but there is a $500 deposit for parties up there. So my Fiance makes a drive down there to pay the deposit, to be told it's not open.  We reserve a table downstairs.  We show up Tuesday, seated, slow service, etc, but it's kinda ok since it's a party and we're not going anywhere.  It's ok until we see people coming and going on the roof....to be told that they discourage parties up there.  I wish they would just get it together, because it could be great, instead it's disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and notice this is a place for drinks and not necessarily dining. I ordered a mushroom burger and people with me ordered food that was not complicated (in my opinion) to make- it took nearly 45 mins to make it to the table. Our waitress did not fill our drinks and took long to make it back to check on us."}
{"text":"Fun place, locally owned.  I don't care for the heckling birds....but, kids and old people love it.

Beer choices are good.  Didn't care for the staff drinking at the Bar top.

I shall return"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time a few days ago and had an amazing time. The bartender Steven was very knowledgeable about all of the beers and even organized a tour for us with the bar manager. We ended up with a few flights and they're extremely unique beers are worth a visit. Drink good beer."}
{"text":"A wonderful atmosphere with great potential. We had dinner on the second week after opening and it was hectic, poor table lighting to read menu, food and service was slow because they were so busy. But we will be back to see how they have worked out the kinks. Great partnership to care for birds."}
{"text":"Just as bad as I remember. I want to like this place so bad but they wont let me. Food and service are the worst. Never again."}
{"text":"This is a unique place. Huge aviaries with some beautiful birds. Food selection is a bit on the limited side. I had the chicken strips. Good batter. Not the best I've ever had, not the worst. Good selection of local beers. Nice sunset views from the upper deck. Location is not exactly ideal. It's hidden partially behind and between  a strip mall of other cafes and a fast food fish and chips place. Addirional parking can be found across the street as the parking lot is small where the restaurant is actually located."}
{"text":"Had reservations, did not get seated until 40 min after reservations,took another 30 min for drinks to arrive to the table. The food order took another 45 minutes.  Some orders where cold and had to be sent back. This was for a party of 8. Not happy with our first time visit. The birds where the only thing enjoyable."}
{"text":"Good brunch (I had the carnitas tamale and hubby had the breakfast burger) and unique atmosphere (birds everywhere) in downtown Chandler. You will need to workout afterward or be ok with lots of calories. We plan to go back."}
{"text":"Today I made my first visit to The Perch during Happy Hour and to my surprise, it was actually a pretty cool spot with a lot of potential. They had a decent amount of customers and their theme is consistent with their name, birds. They had several exotic birds in their courtyard (in cages) and lots of plants, giving you the allusion of being somewhere very far from Arizona. The only downside to this is that all of the foliage made it extremely difficult to locate the building. My friends and I all had a challenging time finding this obscure location, and then being to identify the restaurant/any type of sign was almost impossible. 
When we were inside we saw that their food menu and beer selection seemed pretty nice, and I was very excited to try their hummus because they had two unique flavors. I ordered a hummus board, their sweet potato and marshmallow tots, and a turkey club sandwich. Their hummus board came with a great amount of fresh veggies, sliced pita, and two scoops of hummus (one of each flavor). This is where the disappointment followed. I specifically remember one hummus was supposed to be a \"roasted chili + lime beer\" flavor, but it was so bland! No heat from the chilis, no hint of lime, no trace of any beer. The only thing you could really pick up was a bland chick pea flavor. And both scoops tasted nearly identical. The turkey club wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about either. And the sweet potato and marshmallow tots seemed like sweet potato tots...tossed in maple syrup...and mixed in with some marshmallows? Not exactly what I was expecting. My friend ordered a belgian peach beer that they brew on sight and said it was delicious so at least their beer is good!

Overall, the food was slightly disappointing, and the spot was hard to find, but once you're inside it seems like it could be a pretty good place to hang out or meet for just drinks."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful and the birds all around were amazing! However the food could've been a bit better for my taste, but the attraction there was the best"}
{"text":"Nice concept and good food. My challenge is that I emailed in September asking if there is a time of year where they would be opening the roof top before 4pm, where we could enjoy the space when the afternoon weather in AZ is gorgeous. Maggie answered my email and said they might open it at 4pm, and that they don't take reservations. I hadn't asked about reservations, but fair enough. I was confused about the 'maybe open at 4pm' part since their website advertises 4pm-1am and I was asking about earlier hours in other seasons. I said that to Maggie and she said their website was wrong about them even opening the roof at 4pm, and she thought they fixed it. Ok...but as of today, 10/9, their website still says 4pm-1am. My original feedback about maybe opening it earlier was never acknowledged. I know it's a small thing, but sometimes that speaks volumes about how a business is run."}
{"text":"Only one star because zero wasn't an option. Service was terrible, waitress, manager?and then the other manager? Were very rude and dismissive,  in fact his final words after being told that she's young was not an acceptable response to the waitress was rude. His final response was have a nice night I'm done here. Save your money and go some place that understands customer service!"}
{"text":"Been there many times, have always had a good time, great service, and exceptional meal.  The garden burger salad is to die for."}
{"text":"so many issues...

~Long greet time, waiting to see if a server would notice us. 10+ minutes.  

~Never got 2 green Ice teas we asked for and were charged for. 

~Had to ask for water and coffee refill. Mugs were taken back to beverage area and refilled there and switched up.  Gramps got my lipstick stained mug. Coffee should always be refilled by a carafe table side.  

~Sitting at hightop in bar area, I could clearly see into kitchen and pizza oven area.  Pizza cook was eating in between making guests' pizzas and not wearing gloves. 

~35-40 minute cook times.  WOW.  3 entrees served to table and we had to wait on the others.  One arrived,  and then we still had to remind him that our son didn't get his french toast yet.  

~Steak and Eggs.  Gramps ordered meduim rare, came out rare. I ordered Meduim, came out 
well, well done.  On both eggs and hash were barely warm and dry looking like they sat under a heat lamp.  We sent mine back, they cooked another and then replated it with the SAME old eggs and hash.  We expressed concern about this to waiter.  He notified the manager and we really thought she would swing by our table given how long everything took. All eggs were just gross.

Our server was polite, yet absolutely clueless.  I blame poor hiring and/or training by management. The whole place seems under staffed.  Cleanliness and following safe food handling appears to be an issue too.  I can not believe the manager chose not to speak with us (again, shows poor training, inexperience, or just lack of concern about customers).  

I would have preferred to privately give her this feedback on our experience as I think this place has huge potential.  The owners need to hire someone with more operational experience.

This was our third time.  Service was never good, but it just awful now.  We won't go back until I see the \"under new management\" banner. 

Only highlight~

~Beer selection is great, but there are too many other local brewery establishments that get it ALL right."}
{"text":"Thought we would check this place out as we are frequent visitors of The neighboring Yoli's Cafe. The trip included our dog, so we anticipated pet-friendly seating. The hostess was friendly but made seating us at one of the 20 open tables more difficult than it should have been. We were put in a high traffic area where our pup was happy to observe passers by, and remained very well behaved...but could've been thought out better. The bird sanctuary is pretty amazing. Not sure how that plays into the health code and how often the tables are wiped down and disinfected though. The breakfast burrito was spot on while the French toast was a huge fail...very soggy and mushy, making it inedible.  The eggs and hash browns were cold to top it off.

Overall, it's a cool concept that under delivered. Lots of extra unnecessary clutter of pots and broken patio furniture along with a weekend waitstaff that's more than likely hungover from the night before. 

We weren't able to make it up to the rooftop to enjoy brunch as it is not pet friendly seating. Guess we will be back to enjoy a happy hour on the rooftop at a later date in hopes that the experience is a better one."}
{"text":"Once again I found this place entirely based on a Yelp search.  You will not see this place from the street, but it is worth searching out.  I've done happy hour with the family downstairs and I've done a Friday night happy hour upstairs with adults.  You just can't find this in AZ.  The upstairs patio is amazing.  What a great place to hang out.  I'm not quite sure what will happen in the dead of summer as this place is almost entirely outdoors, but we will figure that out when the time comes.  As of right now the upstairs and the restaurant are amazing around dusk.  The only thing holding it back from my 5th star is that the upstairs does not offer the same beer selection as downstairs.  Its entirely different.  So basically I found myself going downstairs to get a selection of their awesome local craft beer selection and then going back upstairs.  There is a nice bar upstairs, but perhaps in the future they need to find a way to offer the same drafts upstairs as downstairs.  FYI upstairs is 21 and over after 3pm.  I'm loving Chandler downtown!"}
{"text":"If you like birds and a good time, go here for lunch!

Good food. Unique atmosphere with the birds in big cages - feels like you are in the jungle if you sit outside!

The wings are smoked and are ridiculously good!

My wife and I came here one time and shared a cheese and meat tray appetizer - it comes out looking fancy and we nibbled for an hour while we talked about life!

Try this place.
Jon H."}
{"text":"Fun place.  Clean despite all the birds and flies.  Food is decent.  We had the wings, sausage plate, and bruschetta (the apricot honey was delicious).  Will come again."}
{"text":"My first time here and it is awesome!  ANDREW was kind enough to give us tour of the upcoming brewery! I can't wait to try the brews.  The beer list is amazing. Each time I get to try something new.  On the upstairs patio and the staff is very attentive never letting my glass get empty. We are only had a couple of apps the hummus is amazing!  Next time we will be here for dinner!  Also live music on a Sunday afternoon yes please! 
Not to mention a perfect patio day in Arizona. Perfect
Weather!"}
{"text":"We loved everything about the restaurant!  The atmosphere with the greenery and birds was so inviting.  The misters were so refreshing and kept the temperature comfortable.  The wait staff was very attentive, the food was delicious and served very quickly.  The prices seemed very fair for what we ordered.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A local place, on a street that parallels Arizona Ave. They got their name from the bird cages all over the place, which lend themselves to the great atmosphere. The food and service were excellent. Been there twice for lunch, so I don't know how it is at night when the roof garden is open and has live music. There is a virtual forest of plants and trees, which help make the place  a big break from the cookie-cutter chain eateries."}
{"text":"All I'm going to say is...The Perch Burger. Holy Hell. Oh my YUM. 

Oh, and a truly amazing atmosphere and area. 

Love this place. Great craft beers, my BF loves them."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer. They change their craft beers often and aren't afraid to experiment. The design of this place is very interesting. You'd never know it's back there in that nook."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential, great ambiance with the trees, lights and birds. Service is slow but the beer is good once you get it. The food Is hit and miss. Pretzels are good, green chili pizza has a good concept but a little dry and the bruschetta isn't anything to rave about. Still want to try the chicken and waffles! We will come back but would like to see this place step it up a little on service and food."}
{"text":"We went to The Perch often and would recommend it to others. With the newest changes to the menu along with the prices, we've removed Perch from our Go To list. The hummus board was one of the best in town and now we have no better description than \"it sucks\". Bring the beer cheese soup back."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday afternoon and everything from the start was bad.  We waited 10 minutes for a table to be cleared and it never was so we sat at a different table.  It took another 10 minutes before we were actually \"waited\" on by a server walking by and telling us \"our\" server would be right with us.  We asked to order drinks from her since she was there.  She took our order and our server nor our drinks never came before we left after 15 minutes.  Service is HORRIBLE. From the reviews, it appears terrible service is  the norm here. We left and went to Murphy's Law- had immediate and great service!  We will never go back to The  Perch but will definitely go back to Murphy's Law--great food and great service."}
{"text":"Good food, great beer in a different setting.  I have always had good service, bartenders are friendly.  

Tried the smoked jalapeno wings and tater tots with gouda.  Best wings I have ever had!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here last night (Sat Oct 8,2016 around 9pm) because i've heard a lot about this place but never checked it out so we finally decided to try it out. I really liked the the atmosphere walking in. There was a lot of plants and nice lighting. The hostess asked us where we would like to be seated inside, outside or upstairs. I asked for her recommendation and she said upstairs and pointed us up the stairs for some reason we all felt that she recommend us upstairs because she didn't have to walk us up to a table. We went upstairs and it was a totally different vibe. Blue led lights everywhere and a much older crowd. I don't understand why the hostess would of recommended us upstairs. We came down and asked to be seated outside. She didn't look very excited to seat us. We also never received napkins and utensils. Once we sat down at our table i really enjoyed the atmosphere. Really relaxed and our server was great as well. Other than that, the food was horrible. We got the arepas and burger which was on focaccia bread, forgot the name it was so terrible. The arepas were so dry and were served on old stale biscuits. The fococcia on the burger was dry and the meat was not all that great. Its a shame because I loved the laid back atmosphere but because the food and the service (minus our server) was so terrible, i won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I have been in twice. Both times service was slow. Second time the bartender was less than professional. However, beer and food was good. Enjoyed the environment. Live music sometimes on the rooftop."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The wait time was a little long but it was worth it! I enjoyed their grilled cheese with tater tots, highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Waited over 30 minutes today to sit inside because it was 90F and no table was available so we were ultimately seated outside. So hot, and no misters nearby.

Besides the heat, the flies outside were disgusting. An abnormal amount of flies. Perhaps because of the nearby birds?

The hostesses should dress a little more professional. Two with shorty shorts and one with see through pants where we can see a black thong :-(

I know long, bushy beards are popular with hipsters and Duck Dynasty but is it appropriate on a server?
Thankfully he wasn't our server but there is no way I'd have him serve our food and drinks.

Due to these observations, I'm not returning."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was meh, waiter brought the food and didn't check on us until we were almost done eating and our drinks had been empty for a while. Another table complained to a different waiter who wasn't sure where the guy went either, seems we just ended up with a bad waiter as the other sections were getting great service."}

Would try one more time and hope for better.

=====

A few friends and I decided to try this restaurant out last night after hearing it was a nice venue to start the Friday night.

The Perch is tucked away, almost hidden, on S Wall.  Driving down Wall you will have that \"Oh god I made a wrong turn into the wrong neighborhood\" feeling before you see it's lights.  Parking is decent, with a car lot immediately in front of Perch and a larger one at the intersection of Wall and Chicago.

Perch has two levels, the first having an open, courtyard setting that I found very nice.  There's also a bar on the first level that has TVs over hanging if you like to have the feeling of a roof over your head.

My friends and I decided to seat ourselves on the second level, which is open air and has a more hip, lounge-like feel.  The view facing the east is one of the nicer views I imagine there are in Chandler, with the City Hall building lending enough to the skyline to make you forget you're in Chandler.

For drinks, I kept it simple and went with the San Tan Devil's Pale Ale, which I'd had before and liked. 

For dinner, I ordered the prime dip, which must be new as I don't see it on Perch's website menu.  It's prime rib served au jus on a pretzel bun.  After asking the waitress if I could have the meat cooked medium, she informed me that they didn't cook the meat to order.  Ok...fair enough.

When my food was brought out, the meat looked of the quality you'd find in a Philly cheesesteak from a street vendor.  The cut was noticeably fatty, to the point where it was difficult to actually stomach chewing into it at some points.  The meat was also very, very salty, and the \"jus\" dipping sauce was salty to the point of giving that biting, chemical feel to my tongue.

A friend of mine ordered the same dish and had the same critique.  

In fairness, my friends who ordered the wings, pig wings, and garlic tater tots, found them to all be really good.  So, overall, I had a disappointing first experience but am willing to give Perch another try sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Tonite it's a 1
Monday night and it's been an hour since we've ordered and still no food"}
{"text":"Just called to make reservations for Sunday Brunch, I realize it's a busy St. Patrick's Day Friday, but your host was quite rude as she informed me that \"we aren't taking reservations for Sunday\"..... Ok, I won't be coming in then, Thank You!"}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place. Went on a Sunday at 12:30, they were just about to wrap up their brunch. I was told the wait was 10 minutes which I figured about right since there were so many empty tables and they seemed to be at 30% capacity. We waited over 30 minutes sitting by 2 empty tables. When I let the receptionist know, she apologized for the glitch, and proceeded to seat a group that arrived AFTER US!. At that point, why the heck would I spend $9 for tater tots, and $20 for a crab cake, when the establishment doesn't have any regard for their guests. The restaurant itself was very cool with all of the birds, and I wouldn't have minded the prices at all, but I refuse to spend over a 100% markup on food, and a 15-20% gratuity when a restaurant doesn't care about their guests. Didn't realize how many restaurants were within walking distance in that area. We walked over to a wonderful Mexican restaurant where we were immediately greeted with a warm, free order of chips."}
{"text":"I love the Perch! I love the environment around you and the food is amazing as well. You feel comfortable when eating here. I love sitting upstairs especially in the winter time!"}
{"text":"4 stars for ambience and my delicious strawberry, basil cocktail. 3 stars for food. I had the hummus and lebneh cheese sandwich with vegetables. It ended up being a lot of bread, a smear of hummus, only peppers (\"vegetables\" to me implies different kinds-and I'm not a fan of peppers to begin with). The \"cheese\" was a super thin smear that looked like cream cheese. My friends cheese platter looked great, but the salads were almost all lettuce and not a lot of topping. I've heard the pizzas were good."}
{"text":"Warning ! Do not go! Received a raw burger , staff was not friendly or knowledgable of the menu . While waiting for the bathroom a waiter and waitress came out of the ladies room . After we complained and got up in between the meal the manager was unconcerned with the experience of his customers . 
Looks like they take care of their birds more then the customers ."}
{"text":"Super cool spot. Our server Chiara was very attentive and knew the menu very well. It made for a great time! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved it.  The atmosphere outside was a tropical paradise in the middle of Arizona.  The service was amazing.  They have birds surrounding you and you can tell the staff truly cares about each one.  I'm not certain,  but I think they also work with AZ bird rescue. Amazing place.  There are private areas,  indoor and outdoor bar areas.  This place has everything and the staff is wonderful."}
{"text":"Very very very dissatisfied with the perch! My boyfriend and I have came regularly every Sunday since the summer, we weren't here for about a month due to other things in our life. We came back to our favorite place for mac and cheese that's what we've always ordered. We came mid afternoon like normal and was told we couldn't order off the menu only the brunch menu because it was before two, which we've never had problems in the past! I emailed the restaurant and was told they have a new GM which now in my opinion was not the best idea. Also in the email it wasn't acknowledged why we couldn't get what we ordered at that time when in the past we NEVER had this issue. So we came today, 12/4, came at a time after brunch was over so we didn't have the time problem on ordering what we wanted. Got the Mac and cheese of course and the carnitas dip as an app. The carnitas dip was great like always. However, the reason we came week after week for, the mac and cheese was another story! They've changed it, the pasta noodles they use, no bread crumbs like before, it was dry when we are used to the cheese sauce being more than overwhelming which was great! No flavor like it's had. Very disappointed with the perch! Our server came many times to check on us which was great but service can only be part of the experience. It makes me sad. Not sure if we'll be back any time soon! Which is really unfortunate especially when we don't live in the area and drive over an hour every week for this place!"}
{"text":"They let people smoke on the upstairs patio. It's legal but it's still disgusting and disrespectful to the rest of their customers. One star based off of that. This isn't some local dive where I'd just ignore it, it's a full service restaurant. Inexcusable.

Also, service is slow and food is spotty."}
{"text":"I went here with my husband for lunch. Someone told him it was good. It most certainly was NOT! We were very disappointed. I ordered an Italian sandwich on their lunch menu. It was on toasted white bread and had two slices of mystery meat in it ,one of which was full of fat. There wasn't any cheese on it either. Horrible! Being Italian it was insulting. The tater tots that came with it were incredibly greasy. The grease was running down my plate. My husband ordered a roast beef sandwich which had one slice of meat also and his tots were even more greasy if that was possible. Their exotic birds probably ate better than we did that day. We will NOT be returning there."}
{"text":"I've visited The Perch four different times now..

Beer Selection: Excellent. Many taps with a rotating selection.

Food: Good, not great but good.

Service: HORRIBLE. Honestly it was horrible when they first opened,  which is to be expected.  But multiple visits over have shown is hasn't changed. Very common to see the staff gathering in a corner talking while customers are waiting to order."}
{"text":"Great spot nestled in downtown Chandler. The place lives up to its name with cages filled with exotic birds and their sounds fill the air around their extensive patio and rooftop outdoor seating. Interesting menu with plenty of pub classics as well as lighter options. House beers are solid and they have a pretty extensive beer list as well as a full bar."}
{"text":"This was a great, unique place for brunch. The atmosphere cannot be surpassed. The food was unique and reasonably priced. Drinks were strong and service was fast and friendly. My husband had the omelet and I had the churro. I thought they could have used a bit more spice. The atmosphere and scenery alone makes it a worthwhile stop."}
{"text":"Every beer these guys brew is outstanding, and I drink a lot of beer. The food is top notch, exceeding most brewpubs I've been too. The birds are a welcome and fun addition to the atmosphere. The Perch burger is legitimately one of my favorite burgers anywhere. I'm an out-of-towner but always make it a point to head to Perch when I'm in town. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Nice eclectic place,  the food was good,  but different.  Only complaint is how loud and annoying the birds can be at times.  My husband enjoyed the large televisions as we went there to watch the game."}
{"text":"The Phoenix area is so sprawled and spread out, you think you have to drive a long distance to get to a great neighborhood lounge, but that's not always the case! Just off Frye near Country Club, there is a great neighborhood gem. That gem is known locally as The Perch! A great friendly and professional environment, and super chill atmosphere! Check out the upstairs bar for a great view from The Perch! And don't forget to try their own craft brew and Duck sliders!"}
{"text":"Cute place, but a nice ambiance isn't enough to survive on. The food looked great but unfortunately we didn't get a chance to order anything because the service upstairs was so slow. The bartender was rude and the server was absentminded, we waited a half hour for waters and eventually left. I would like to come back and be downstairs when it is not so busy and they are well staffed."}
{"text":"Perch is f'n tight. Love this place. Great beers. Better than San Tan, up there with my other favorite Wilderness."}
{"text":"This is a very unique restaraunt which fits in perfectly for downtown atmosphere.  It is a bit hidden and might look questionable to new guests because of the run down building next to it.  It did take awhile to get our food but we were ok with that due to some great live jazz band playing.  The menu could be a little more diverse and some gluten free options would be nice.  Overall neat hang out place."}
{"text":"I tried to give this place another chance but it failed again.  Great environment but food SUCKS again.  Not sure why but I'm done!"}
{"text":"If you like snarky, slow service and untrained staff who are full of excuses, this is the place for you. I was meeting up with some fellow beer nerd friends from out of town, and they suggested The Perch due to the beer selection. I had not been since shortly after their opening, so I said sure and made the trek from downtown phx. 
When I got there, they had already put their names down for a table, finished a beer while waiting and we started on round 2. The beer was one of theirs, a Belgian blonde. While not my favorite style, it was a decent beer and tasted like cheerios, which is exactly what I would expect from the style.
Finally (friends who beat me there said it was almost an hour total wait time) we were seated, and put in our orders for an appetizer and entrees. We got the goat cheese tots, which were delivered by a clueless food runner wandering around the patio asking if anyone had ordered them...really?! They didn't give you a table number?! When we finally waved her down, she stated that she was pretty bummed someone claimed them, as she was pretty hungry herself. Joke or not, it wasn't the most professional. According to our server, the confusion is because they just put tables on this area of the patio, the servers don't know the numbers and the manager never made a key... Sounds like all around incompetence to me.
By the time we finished sharing the bowl of tots by stabbing our own forks in the bowl, small plates and napkins arrived, presumably to go with the tots. Considering this was 30 minutes after ordering an appetizer, and 15 minutes after getting it to the table, her 'Well, that was fast' comment was not well received. 
At this time, we ordered a round of beers. 15-20 mins later, we still did not have beers. Or the food that was ordered much earlier. Now don't get me wrong, I fully understand that Friday nights are busy, especially somewhere like Chandler where there isn't much to do. But I'm sorry, 20-30 minutes is unacceptable for 3 beers, no matter what. Clearly more, and more experienced staff is needed. My friend advised the server that we had been waiting almost 30 mins for our beers and instead of checking on them, or apologizing she snapped at him 'Actually it's only been 15!' And then mumbled something about how it wasn't her fault. Not cool lady, not cool.
At this point, we had no beers, no food and were sassed by a server so my friend asked to speak to the manager. 
Another 5 minutes later, our beers, and the manager showed up. We let him know what the problems were, and he offered to take care of our dinner for us. We let him know that while appreciated, we had not even gotten entrees yet, and really did not have any more time to wait (it had been about 2 hours from when they first got there and got on the list) so if he could take care of our beers and the tots we would be leaving. He apologized again, but he didn't seem too surprised by anything we told him, so I'm guessing this is pretty normal. 

We went down the street to Murphy's Law, a packed Irish bar with live music... Got a table, a round of beers and food in less than 20 minutes. That's how you do it."}
{"text":"We so wanted to love this place.  The atmosphere is incredible.  My husband and I went there last night (Saturday) around 6.  We were told it was an hour wait.  That's fine...we got a drink and looked at the birds.  We were finally sat and the waitress seemed very friendly.  It took about 15 mins for our drinks to come out.  We quickly ordered and it took an HOUR to get our food.  We watched tables who sat after us get appetizers and entrees before us.  My husband asked if she forgot about us and she blamed the cooks.  My husband got his burger which was raw!  I ordered a salad and it came out 10 mins after my husbands burger.  I complained about his raw burger and again she blamed the cooks.  He couldn't even eat.  She didn't comp it or anything.  We were so incredibly disappointed.  The upside was the tater tots...very delicious.  I really love the atmosphere so maybe happy hour would be a better time to go?!?  Please get more help or better organization."}
{"text":"First time checking out The Perch was yesterday, and was pleasantly surprised with all the good stuff packed into a quirky little spot.  Took out of town family and had a great time.  Service was good.  Dustin was friendly, hard working and made our experience very good.  We'll be back to enjoy the great atmosphere, good food, and rooftop sunsets."}
{"text":"This is a very chill place, and when the weather is nice and you can sit outside, or they open the place up - it's excellent.  They have a respectable variety in the brews they carry, and the menu isn't huge, but it has enough options to satisfy any palette.  BUT... that is not the big reason to go here.  The real reason is...

They have freakin' birds all over the place!  They have all of these big cages outdoors, and inside them are these giant birds, like a parrot, and a big white one with crazy eyes, and then a bunch of little birds come to hang out with the big ones! It's a bird party what are you missing out for, you dingus!?  Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Came here last weekend for lunch with our family in a group of 5. My husband and I just moved here from Chicago a month ago so its still incredibly novel for me to sit outside for lunch on Halloween weekend. We have some family in Chandler so they suggested The Perch for lunch. While sitting, I mentioned that I felt like I was in Key West, with the lush trees all around.

I had the Chipotle Chicken Cesar salad and it was pretty tasty. Didn't have any beers, but look forward to trying one in the future.

There were tons of flys landing all over our food and we got chased out by a bee toward the end of the meal, but that's the price you pay, I guess, for wanting to sit outside.

Be sure to check out the bird when you walk into the waiting area, though you probably can't miss them!"}
{"text":"I love the bird concept - And I would love to know the story behind the idea.  Is the owner a lover of birds?    In the evening though, they nearly all have their little beaks tucked into their wings, trying to get some shut eye.  The architecture is awesome, and the place is quite lively.  Fun music, which they did turn down when it got too loud to have a conversation.  Very nice beer list, with ones I have not seen elsewhere.  Even served the stout at a nice temperature, so I did not have to wait for it to warm up.  Huss, Hess, Dragoon, 4 Peaks, San Tan, Lagunitas ... The smoked burgers sounded great, but were overcooked.  Nice tots.  They had Sriracha too, thank goodness.  Nice vegetarian options on the menu also.  Could use some desserts -- something ooye gooyee chocolaty is my recommendation. Also, I hear they will be brewing their own.  Which got us talking about bird-themed names for their brews.  Albatross Ale.  Toucan for the imperial IPA (because, two-can-do-you-in).  Red Robin Red.  Looking forward to another visit!
Oh, I disagree - the birds are not gross.  Birds can be messy.  But they are away from the tables, and there were no feathers, smell or bird mess to ruin our time"}
{"text":"The Hidden Gem of Downtown Chandler, located in historic Wall Street, across from City Hall. The Perch offers a wide variety of specialty beers, amazing food and exotic birds from around the world. When you first enter The Perch you'll notice that it's always busy even whenever it's nearly 100 degrees out! When you are seated you'll feel as if you were transported to somewhere in the heart of the tropics. The scenery is beautiful with amazing landscaping and gorgeous flowers. The menu, though a little pricy, is worth every penny. From what I've had the best by far, had to be the Spinach and Artichoke Grilled Cheese. This was honestly, hands down the best grilled cheese I've ever had in my life. It was full of everything I love, Cheesy Spinach and Artichoke goodness, smoked bacon and green tomatoes. The tots are also to die for. Whenever the Perch had first opened the management was very slow, but now the flow moves so much faster and the staff are very attentive and polite. If you haven't had the Perch yet, I advise you do hands down, 2 thumbs up. Best craft beer and food you'll ever have."}
{"text":"There are better places for craft beer. Food is mediocre. The space is great and has a lot of potential. Our bartender was both knowledgable, enthusiastic, and polite. The patio and upper deck look especially inviting on the 9 months of the year that aren't the AZ summer. But, the birds and bird cages are a bit much. I get it. You're The Perch. But you don't need to litter the patio with caged birds to sell the theme."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome! On the other hand, we ordered wings and they said they were out (it was only 6pm). Then we ordered the trio hummus which was not good. For an entree I got the guacamole and chili burger that was pretty good. Lastly, the service was alright. I think this would be such a great place if they could fix the menu and spruce up service."}
{"text":"Sunday March 5
As a parrot owner I wanted to check this place out. overall pretty cool joint. They need to figure out a way to clean the birdcages on a regular basis, they were pretty dirty.

As for the rest...
We came in from the west entrance and there was no signage to tell us to go around to the hostess stand. I found a waitress and asked her if we seat ourselves, she pointed us to the 'front'. there were a lot of empty seats and a ton of folks waiting to be seated, not sure what was going on but we were told we could go upstairs, so we did. I have to agree with one of the other posters here, the hostesses were not very helpful. I would chock this up to poor training/mgmt oversight.

Up at the rooftop bar our bartender sucked. Some skinny dude with tats on his arms... not judging, just letting you know who he was because he shouldn't be a bartender. He seemed more interested in doing anything else than helping customers. We ordered a beer sampler, he couldn't even remember which ones were which and then picked one of them up, smelled it, dumped it and poured another beer. He treated everyone at the bar equally, like shit! We ordered some food and it took forever for it to come out... when he finally brought it out, it was stone cold and like other posters here said, bland! Everything needed more seasoning. 

I saw the coffee mugs and asked the bartender if I could buy one, he pointed me to the gift shop downstairs and said they are for sale down there. what he failed to mention was the gift shop is closed on sundays... really pissed me off after the rest of the experience here... I needed a new coffee cup for home and would have really loved this one.

Very cool decor, layout, landscaping, birds etc but the overall service sucks. This comes down to piss poor training on managements part. Either they don't know what they're doing or they don't care.... maybe things are different when the owners are around... maybe not.

As for the beers... they were good, we tried 5 of the 7 Perch brews on tap and like every one of them, tell the brewer good job. The rest of you need some serious training and/or firing and get some quality folks in there. Needless to say we came all the way from Glendale to check you guys out... we won't be back."}
{"text":"Nice outdoor environment but the food is only so so at best. Don't go if you're really hungry. Drinks are average."}
{"text":"Great rooftop concept, poor location. Arizona is just too hot for this. The birds are another cool concept, but after a while the squawking gets a tad annoying. Cool place if you're in the right mood."}
{"text":"If you want to try something different, come here. The ambiance is the biggest selling point of the place, but the food doesn't fall too far behind. I ordered the burger and it was really good. The prices are a bit steep, but nothing too outrageous. Service was a bit spotty, but the food came out quickly and there's plenty of shade to eat outside.

Can't speak on the brewery part, waiting one more year for that!"}
{"text":"I was invited by a friend for happy hour. It was a enjoyable evening with friends. The service was extremely pleasing through out the meals! Very helpful staff when asked about the menus with great recommendations! The food was good and atmosphere nice! I look forward to going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere!  There was live music Saturday night on the rooftop patio. The fan misters kept us cool and the view from the rooftop was nice. There were so many beers to choose from.  It was fun to try ones I have never heard of. Try the citrus shrimp salad or the chicken and waffles both were delicious. Would love to see more fish options on the menu apps and dishes. Overall fun place...."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great, but all downhill from there.  Not a fan of their beers, and the food is ho-hum pub fare."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say I dislike this place. But I don't love it. Been here a few times because I have friends who live close by. Great meeting place for a beer but food is mediocre. Although I enjoyed their wings. It was smoky and melts off the bone. Never had wings like that. I would give this place a 2.5 to 3 stars. I don't like the idea of all the birds being caged up. It's the theme of the restaurant but it's really hot out and the water wasn't changed out for them the last time I was there. Please properly tend to them!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere outside in the garden with the birds. Smoked burgers, beer dough pizza, and craft beers; can't beat that. Some of the beers are odd so definitely sample first."}
{"text":"Cool place tucked away in downtown Chandler. Love the beers, tots and spinach & artichoke grilled cheese. Make sure you check out the rooftop bar."}
{"text":"Giving it one star maybe overrating this place. We had to ask twice for a server after sitting down. I ordered chicken strips, which is basic, with BBQ sauce. When we got the bill they charged $.50 for ranch? They charged me for the side of BBQ sauce. Likely won't return."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time a couple weeks ago- aside from an undrinkable cocktail that needed to be sent back it was a pleasant enough dining experience. The food was solid, servers seemed a bit overwhelmed but were adequate, and the ambiance was great. We thought we would give it another go last night but were disappointed. After being seated we failed to receive any acknowledgement from our section's server. After a solid 15 minutes of being ignored we decided to take our money elsewhere. 

Fortunately there are many more put together operations for good food and drink in downtown Chandler (Vintage 95 and San Tan to name a few) and we will be giving them our business, at least until The Perch makes some necessary improvements."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 2 stars because I loved the birds and the atmosphere, wouldn't know about the beer or the food. We first went to the rooftop to check it out, it had ambiance, but too many smokers so we went to the hostess downstairs who seated us in the bar where we sat staring at the menus, neither the bartender or the waitress who passed us 8-10 times  had eye contact or acknowledged we were there. I understand if a restaurant is really busy and can't get to you right away but 15 minutes had passed and nothing! The bar was moderately busy, the rest of the restaurant had plenty of seating. We got up left and went to San Tan brewery, which was packed but had some great beer and food. My husband said he would never go back to The Perch, I may go back to see the birds."}
{"text":"A good little bar and brewery. The birds (exotic) aren't my thing but the food and beer is good... Worth stopping in to try."}
{"text":"Really love the idea and look of this place, with all of the exotic birds in the mix. We got there at 7:30, just as it was getting dark, but I recommend going earlier. The music and general noise from the bar was drowning out the wonderful bird sounds. Once it was dark, we might as well have been in any other outdoor bar setting.

The food was pretty good - nothing spectacular. The fish & chips (comes with tots, not fries) is mostly breading and very little fish. Disappointing really, when you compare to some other brew spots with fantastic fish & chips. The Brick Oven Tamale was a little bit better - flavorful, but mostly masa. 

Beer choice was very good and they don't force \"IPA or nothing\" on you. The little 5 oz. options allows you to try many brews without getting too drunk or busting your wallet. I enjoyed the Perch Peacoat Brown Porter the most.

I will certainly go back, but I'll be sure it's on a lazy weekday when I have some time to enjoy a couple of choice beers, listen to the birds and enjoy the atmosphere. Not sure if the limited menu deserves another chance or not - maybe the green chile pork pizza, which sounds yummy."}
{"text":"Great beer on draft! knowledgeable and friendly staff...Chandler needs more bars like this!"}
{"text":"I have not tried their food yet but the beers I had were excellent. If you want to sit outside on a nice patio this place is great, but it is mostly all outside. The birds are a little loud for having nice conversation downstairs but the upstairs patio hardly has any noise at all. They have a good amount of shade provided and a mist system to keep you cool."}
{"text":"Really loved the eclectic environment and the birds.  They were very entertaining, something different, and I was absolutely gratified to know they are \"rescues\".  My husband and I live in Chandler and went there for dinner on a weeknight.  Had a house salad each (great) and the Chicken and Waffles (chicken great, waffles were dry).  Prices were reasonable. Went for a walk downtown after dinner.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place was sooooooo good! Really neat that there are birds you can walk around and see and service was good. I had the baked tamale and it was so amazing! My boyfriend and sister had a burger with the beer cheese and they both loved it. This is my new favorite place to get food and beer! My only complaint is there isn't much seeing that's indoors and accessible to elderly at least that I know of. We sat inside but it was all open to the outdoors still which is really cold at night in the winter even with heat lamps. Still will go again though, may just have to do it during the day if I want family to go that can't wait in hightop chairs."}
{"text":"It is hit or miss, in a nutshell. I only recently discovered this place...amazing since they make beer and have such a fun atmosphere and i only live about two miles away. The first time i ate here 3 weeks ago was really good, so i thought \"we will be coming here ALL. THE. TIME.\" Since then, we have eaten here the last two weekends and been now very disappointed in the food and slow service. They need to get consistent and they would be absolutely packed to the gills & one of the coolest places in the Valley, no doubt. We actually got comped almost our entire meal last night, which tells you something. Our food took a long time and almost every thing was cold, terrible. Very nice management, just dont know what's up with everyone else that works there...not unfriendly, any of them, but seriously, what's up with the slow service and inconsistent food?! I think they need to revise...someone came up with a GREAT idea, though, and if you come in for a couple beers you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went there the first time with couple of friends. I probably wouldn't have found it if my friends didn't show me where it is.  The atmosphere was really awesome! I love the layout of the bar and the decorations there. The beer selection was impressive for a place just opened for only a week. Our waiter told us that they plan on brewing their own beers as well. Can't wait! Recommend their happy hour pizza deal!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, and I did enjoy  the atmosphere, but our bill for two hamburgers; two pints of Grand Canyon beer; and one glass of wine was $54.00.  With those prices, we won't be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Loved The Perch. I took my toddler that loved looking at the birds. Getting him not to put his fingers in the cages was a challenge. Lunch was inexpensive but surprisingly good. We had a plate with three different types of hummus with veggies and pita for an app. It was great. I love that they put veggies with the hummus! My husband had the pork belly pizza and I had the shrimp salad. He said that his was ok. I really liked mine. The shrimp salad had citrus in it and the shrimp was grilled. I love that. I would say that the best part of the Perch was the beer selection. I had a great fruity wheat beer."}
{"text":"Does the owner not understand that this review should help him.  Don't criticize people on yelp for having a bad experience at your place.  That's suicide, you are one person.  We aren't the only ones who had a bad experience.  I had 4 people with me.  Would you like all them to put their review on here?  Learn how to run a business.  Also, nothing you did that night dynamically changed on the fly.  You had 3 hostess downstairs doing nothing.  Put 1 on the roof top patio and then sit people up there.  Problem solved."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while. The wait on Saturday for 4 was no problem. We had the Brussel sprout and sausage app, 2 fights and a burger. The kids meals looked good and they were able to accommodate kid allergies. In the past the service was so so but tonight was great. I recommend the Perch as a good place for kids and for outdoor dining. All of the beers were representative of the styles. I liked the Red and also how they had a few other local favorites. It will be less time until I come back next."}
{"text":"Bartender, Steven was so nice and attentive - love that they make their own fruit infused microbrews! They have a pretty decent wine list and a beautiful patio with misters everywhere. Very laid back, casual place. They serve food until close @ 12:30am.  A must see for exotic bird lovers - we will be back every week!"}
{"text":"This is the most beautiful setting, out of the way restaurant.  Tables are out on a patio under beautiful trees and on a roof top patio.  You are serenaded by all kinds of birds in aviaries.  I have only had a few items off the menu and they were very tasty and presented nicely.  This is my new most favorite place to go. (Wednesday is 1/2 price wine day.)"}
{"text":"Went there with my family.   There was 11 of us.   We were told there was gonna be a 30 minute  wait.  We got there and we're seared immediately.   Beer and food cane quockly, but was just ok.  Had the prime rib  au juice sandwich.  I've had better.  Beer was cold though."}
{"text":"So 3 strikes you're out right?

Strike 1. Breakfast. Who starts a restaurant that has only one component required for making a portion of the breakfast menu??? The Perch. That's right...well the maker is out of commission and therefore the only thing I wanted on the menu was not able to be made. Walk next door and check out Yoli's!!! Yummy friendly fun!!!!

Strike 2. Dinner. Show up for dinner. Looking at the venue we see that about 1/3 of the tables are empty. No problem right? Wrong!!! The Perch again!  Placed us on a 25 minute wait. Well...perhaps because they don't know how to turn tables so that wait turned into 1 hour and 20 minute wait. And NO updates! And every time we checked on the status...still a very inaccurate estimate of wait. Sadly I tried 3 of the wines and rejected 3 of the wines because they are that bad! Also not impressed with some of the beers. Of course the variety is impressive when you want to try something new or different. Back to dinner. Well the selection was very limited and I have a very robust palette...needless to say the food did not taste that good and was pricey to boot. 

Strike 3: Drinks. Ok so it is late...close to 9. Clearly only the doofs are out eating dinner at this time. So what is left??? The Drinkers and Dessert Eaters. Right? Not for the Perch!  Again we walk in and 1/3 to 1/2 of the tables are empty...with a 30 minute wait. We know how that goes. So off to the roof to park it and drink. Nope...this place is undeservingly busy and no way of accommodating the demand. So back down the stairs to the bar. Tables Everywhere!!! We sit. We are in the bar. At bar top tables. Do we should get drinks right? Not at the Perch!!! These are restaurant seating tables. Not walk up like any other bar area at any other restaurant in the Phoenix metro area. We were asked to move because the table is not walk up. So we moved to the bar and got obnoxious to scare off some patrons to make room for our group. That works! For us at least...sorry Perch your rules you'll lose. So we pass on dessert because who wants to eat that at the bar. We sampled the wines...why because if you sample all then that is like a free glass or two!!! Sorry Perch. We watched our table sit vacant for 50 minutes and then they sat 2 people at the 6 seater where they kicked out the 4 of us. One orders water. One orders tea. They split an appetizer.  So the Perch made $7 on the table that we would have spent $100 all night long. Instead we each had our free glass and then bought a glass of house each...spent $20 and stiffed the overly tattooed grunge hippy bartenders providing the poor service. 

PLUS DID I MENTION THE HORID SMELL OF BIRD POOP AS YOU WALK UP TO THE PLACE OR AS A WHIFF COMES BY AS YOUR EAT?!?!??

The Perch is a NO GO!  Sorry. I tried."}
{"text":"Great little weekend brunch place! I saw they have yoga and food and drinks on the roof on the weekends. Looks like fun."}
{"text":"Went to The Perch on a weekend lunch date with my husband. We sat on the rooftop lounge and were fully enjoying the perfect weather and atmosphere. I had the Salmon Salad which was exceptional and he had the chicken strips which he also said was good. The problem? THE SERVICE WAS PAINFUL!!  I asked for some sweetener when I ordered my iced tea... It took over 10 minutes and 2 more requests to get it. It took a long time to place our order and an even longer time to get it and it's a good thing we enjoyed our food because she did not check on us once. We both could've used refills on our drinks but I left feeling thirsty instead.  The bar could have made a few more bucks too as my husband would have had another beer had she bothered to check. Customer service can make or break an experience... Unfortunately it was the latter in this case."}
{"text":"Great beer but terrible overpriced food. So disappointed. My husband ordered a personal pizza which he added BBQ sauce to and the pizza actually tasted like sugar. Worst we have ever had. We also had crab cakes which were so salty they weren't edible. We ordered the prime dip sandwich which was ok but nothing I would care to remember. The crab cakes... $17. The prime dip $17...the personal pizza $20...2 flights  $30. We walked out so dissatisfied. It's too bad because it's such a great atmosphere but the menu is overpriced and terrible. Go for the beer but don't order anything else.

Oh and now as an update to my review, we both got sick from the prime rib. Upset stomachs all night...so, don't order that either. I can't believe how terrible of an experience this was. I don't know how they can serve the food they do at the outrageous prices they do. They really need to work on their menu. We definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"The Perch has a cool, relaxing atmosphere. Came with my wife and some friends for the second time, and we'll be back. Food was good and the blond ale from Bisbee was excellent. Bailey our server was top notch. Lots of colorful rescued birds gives it the clever name. You should come check it out."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the Perch, and not knowing what to expect, we were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere and ambience that we experienced. We arrived at around 7 PM on a Thursday night, and there was a slight wait for a table in the dining area downstairs. So after checking at the rooftop bar and patio, which has open seating and is where we actually wanted to sit, we got lucky as a couple was leaving, so we promptly grabbed that hightop table for 2 and waited for our waitress, Tiffany to clear it for us. Her service was top notch from that initial encounter and all the way through our visit. 
Also, we didn't know there would be live music, but there were 2 musicians performing a nice variety of songs, and at an appropriate volume level - loud enough to enjoy but no so loud that you have to raise your voice to have a conversation at your dinner table. 
The fact that this venue is also a bird sanctuary for exotic birds that have been rescued is very cool, IMHO. The owner, Rebecca, actually introduced herself to us and shared the history of her business and the birds - very impressive! 
The only reason I'm rating it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the food. The meals that my wife and I had were ok. Not really good, not really bad - just ok. I actually expected the food to be better prepared, so I was a little disappointed to be honest. I know we arrived at a peak time, so maybe the kitchen was slammed or the chef was having an off night. We will give them another chance, for sure. 
All in all it was a very pleasant experience and we look forward to returning for another visit very soon!"}
{"text":"Met friends. Music from above.  Motown. Wonderful. ..except. .. we had to YELL at each other to be heard.  I continually ask: when did loud music become more important than conversation? ????"}
{"text":"I called two weeks in advance to make a reservation for a party of (7) for Mother's Day. I was told they don't take reservations, but have a wait list. When you check in at the designated time you are put in front of everyone else and wait up to 20 minutes. We checked in and were told an hour.  I reminded the hostess what I was told and she just stared at me. We waited 30 minutes and watched more people check in and the people seated waiting on there food. I decided to walk around and noticed two large tables empty. I went to the front and asked why they weren't using them and the response was they are for reservations . I said you don't take reservations and was told they cap them. This was the most unorganized and unprofessional response. We ended up going elsewhere. They called to say a table was ready two hours later.  Extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"Went to check out the soft opening yesterday. Great outdoor patio, atmosphere, and nice place if you're just looking to get a quick drink but was disappointed with the food. Seemed a little over priced for the quality of ingredients they were using and not the kind of place I would go to get a full meal in the future. Will try and check it out again when they start brewing their own beer."}
{"text":"Just lunched here and experienced very good food and excellent service.  Our waitress, Debbie-O, told us they were still in their soft-opening phase and advised the menu was still a work in progress.  We tried the chip & dip trio to start and LOVED the guacamole and the mango salsa.  I had the citrus chicken caesar and my wife had the citrus shrimp salad...both were very flavorful and worth their $10 prices.  We ordered an 8\" personal pizza to try and found it very good as well.

We sat on the rooftop patio and the overall experience was very good.  It's always nice trying a new restaurant.  We don't drink so can't comment on the beers, etc. but will definitely be going back for the food & service."}
{"text":"So I went to this restaurant with a group of people and we all order our food and hang out until we get it. Time goes on and we have all eaten and a few of us have left. While I am listening to one of the girls from my group talk, I look past her to see A RAT! This rat was climing up the bird cage. So then one of the girls from my group goes to look and low and behold there are two big rats sitting at the very top of the bird cage. Discusting. I felt so incredibly gross. I can't imagine where else the rats would be, but when there is one there are more, and sure enough we found two...."}
{"text":"Management wake up! You have the coolest  restaurant/bar around but the service is probably the worst I have ever seen. I have been here several times and the same problem continues... Poor service! Serving staff is lacking direction, in fact I saw several customers leave because they could not get service and the waitress didn't even know they were her table to serve. It took me 30 minutes to get a beer on several of my visits. The positive is the atmosphere both on the rooftop and downstairs. It is unique and very cool. Also the food I have tried was different and very tasty. If you go to the rooftop be prepared as the service is very slow. I learned to order 30 minutes in advance to get my order due to the slow service. This could be a fantastic place to go for food and drink, but if the service does not improve customers will eventually get too frustrated and find somewhere else to go, and in Downtown Chandler there are plenty of options."}
{"text":"I have really high hopes for this place, and I really want to like it.  They're still fairly new so I think they're still getting their feet under them.  

The neat thing about The Perch is all the birds.  Parrots, lovebirds, and other exotic feathered friends are all rescue birds that live in cages by the entrance of the restaurant.  There's a downstairs seating area with open walls and an upstairs patio with a bar and lots of seating.  It looks like you can reserve a table on the upstairs patio, which would probably be really cool with a larger group.

Drinks are a good value, with wine as low as $5 a glass and different sizes of beer for just a couple of bucks.  The food is decent... I've tried a burger (good), pizza (eh), chips and dip (good) and bruchetta (standard, but good).

Service has been hit or miss, which is why I feel like they're still getting their game together.  I'll definitely be back, and I'm sure hoping things even out for them soon!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever had at a bar and its been consistent. I've been here three times because I love the atmosphere but if you sit on the upper patio be prepared for no service. Nobody working the tables for food or drink orders and when you do step up to the bar they pretend your invisible. Great location and setup........poor execution."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool place - a little hard to find the front door, but the patio seating is amazing.  The bird noises were hilarious, especially during a work lunch, but if you don't want to hear constant chirping interspersed with pterodactyl like shrieks, then you may want to be seated inside.  The Perch would've received more stars if we'd had faster service and if when I told the waiter I couldn't eat the brownie because it was too hard (I even knocked on it like wood) he would've removed it from our check.  No matter how cool a bird filled patio is, I'm way to cheap to enjoy being charged for food I couldn't eat.  This service snag may be a fluke, so I'll update my review accordingly if I go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I had the spinach and artichoke grilled cheese. The server recommended for me to have bacon to be put inside the sandwich. Genius. I have tried the perch rose beer. It was perfect. Not to hoppy. I also tried a cocktail at happy hour (2-6). I forgot what the drink was called but it look like a mojito with strawberries. The table next to me suggested it. Strong and sweet. Just the way I like it. The tater tots ( perfectly crispy) dipped in their garlic ranch was too good. I had to have them taken away. Haha. My boyfriend had the mushroom swissburger and said it was great. Just was too cooked for his liking. He likes it still kicking. Great presentation. Delicious food. Oh and an employee let my daughter feed a bird and orange. Its name was luna it was a white parrot that kept saying hi and dancong to the upbeat music. Great place to go for an early lunch. Sit outside, let the toddler roam. Lots for the children to take in."}
{"text":"The ambiance and friendliness of the staff are stellar. It's got an open-air feel at every table since the walls are rolled up, and there are plenty of patio and upper deck seats.

We tried the beer cheese and beer sausage pizza and cheese board. Both were tasty, although I'd give the edge to the pizza.

They have 30 beer handles plus some bottled beer, so there are lots of great options. We saw a sign for $5 house wine specials every day, which is pretty nice on a weekend night.

A shuttle is offered for those within 10 miles, which is a very nice service. We did not use it, as I was the designated driver, but we probably will in the future.

How to improve to 5 stars:

1. Offer desserts. We heard that pizza cookies are being developed, so this is on the way.
2. The cheese board had very few crackers and a lot of cheese. This could have used more crackers. We used our pizza crust as a substitute.
3. The price point is just a little bit high. Slightly lower prices or larger portions would make The Perch more competitive with the neighboring SanTan Brewery."}
{"text":"I always try to stop at the Perch when I'm in the area. The food is excellent and the atmosphere is a lot of fun. They have great craft and local beers to choose from. Great casual hang out to eat and meet with friends or colleagues."}
{"text":"Great place!  A local somewhat hard to find pub behind Pete's fish in chips. Cool birds. We had the topless salad and perch burger. Both were very good, the salad was exceptional. Great beers and drink specials."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the perch for over a year now with friends and clients.  Being a sunday evening I was not expecting it to be extremely crowded and I was correct yet it took over an hour for a table of 5 to get their food.  When asking the waiter we were told the kitchen had limited people working that night....if you're going to be open for dinner- be staffed correctly.  I will be thinking twice before coming to the Perch again...very disappointed."}
{"text":"The only good thing was the beer.  So, if you want beer, go.  Unfortunately, we wanted food, too. Unfortunately, it was Sunday at lunch hour.  Service was horrible, they forgot the bread with the sausage platter (and forgotten it was, we never saw it), the sandwiches and the burgers were not only meh, it took us 3 days to recover from them.  Like a chef, you really need a special talent to cook a burger to not have any taste.  Or maybe they had to be seasoned with the flies that were everywhere. Yuck!"}
{"text":"My order never arrived my wife's mac&cheese had cold meat on top.  3 other orders of mac&cheese of various varieties at out table also had cold toppings.  Service was slow and the restaurant seemed very poorly managed and understaffed.  This my 3rd time there and they have now officially struck out.  The place its self  nice but the execution is terrible."}
{"text":"If you want to be  ignored and have zero customer service on a Monday night come here. Such a disgusting experience to go through. Spoke to the \"manager \" he could care less from what his comments were. We literally sat at the lower bar for 15-20 without any interaction from anybody keep in mind that the \"manager\" was 3 feet from and yet he simply choose not to provide service for us. I will escalate this to a higher resource"}
{"text":"Service was painfully slow. One salad was so late,  we sent it back. Shrimp is underwhelming as are their olives and hummus. They only have one restroom for the whole restaurant so expect a wait. Tots are excellent, however and the ambiance is great, although the birds can be obnoxious."}
{"text":"This place is really really amazing. Service is impeccable, beer is amazing, food is outstanding.  Love the energy."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  My wife and I went there for lunch and waited and watched everyone get served the exact same thing we ordered.  When the food came it was cold and full of onions even though I explained to our waitress I was alergic to them.  When I asked to speak to the manager I was told she was too busy.  Not a an apology or one sense of concern from anyone.  Too bad I was looking for a place to host my company's summer dinner mixer."}
{"text":"We love the entire atmosphere of this restaurant and views from the open top floor!!!  We only wish the food was a little bit better and more quality, and the servers have been hit or miss. The dessert was delicious though and big dessert portions too!"}
{"text":"We just got back from this place and we had a great time, everyone we had contact with were awesome, from the hostess that greeted us, to the wait staff, we sat in the downstairs bar, and the bartender was super knowledgeable and friendly, we were seated super quick on a Friday night, it was busy... we had a great waiter named  Josh, he was nice, helpful, he knew the menu and the beers, even went out of his way to the upstairs bar to get us a beer that wasn't available in the downstairs bar. Now I read the reviews of the slow service, and I got to say, everyone there was super helpful, and nice. The food was good and big servings, enough to share, for sure. I think people are a little too quick to point out the bad point of places and not give credit to the good points, thanks Josh for a great night out, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Cons:

-- Perpetually understaffed. 
-- You'll see empty tables all around but a 45 min. wait. 
-- Service can be spotty depending on time of day/week. 
-- Hostesses can sometimes be clueless. 
-- Large groups can be loud.
-- Barkeeps can be aloof & sloooowwww. 
-- Chef needs to google \"arepas\" because what they serve js a corn and cheese patty on a bun. 

Still here? Then her are the Pros:

-- Good atmosphere. Great outdoor space. Great concept. 
-- Tater tots are amazing (try jalapeño jelly). 
-- Wings are delicious. 
-- Patio is dog friendly, if you've a 4-legged companion. 
-- Dessert (yes, singular) is surprisingly good. 
-- Beers are really good.
-- Top patio *can* be fun if a bit drunkenly. 
-- Great for large groups and events. 

There, you happy now? Go here at an off peak time and enjoy some brewskies and grub."}
{"text":"Great food and cool atmosphere. It's a little hard to find the place at first, but it's worth the search. Perch is just south of San Tan Brewery.

The place looks like a giant tree house that belongs in a forest and not in the desert. The whole theme is a great getaway from all the \"desert\" themed places around AZ.  On this visit I had a flight (5/5 oz samples) and a personal pizza.

The service was great considering there was only one young lady working the lunch crowd behind the bar. Beers came out quick and my pizza only took about 5-10 mins. 

The beers are all good...didn't have a bad one in the flight. The pizza was awesome. Thin crust with just basil and pepperoni.  I am definitely coming back here on my next trip out to AZ. Can't beat great service, and a flight and personal pizza for less than $20."}
{"text":"Fantastic, unique ambiance.  Nothing else quite like it.  We took our young daughter here and my wife and I split some wine.  My daughter loved checking out the birds, and we loved the nicely priced wine.  

I will take out of state visitors here for sure, at least for a drink."}
{"text":"This place is so cool.  They have birds in cages, an upstairs and downstairs area, live music and lots of heaters.  I thought it was a cool bar. We didn't eat here, but I would def be back for a drink."}
{"text":"If you can get past the noise (and yes, there will be lots haha) then this is a pretty great place to eat. It's very unique with all the bird cages and completely open and outside setting, and feels more like you're eating on a comfortable backyard patio than in an actual restaurant. I've been here twice with my boyfriend, both times when the weather was a bit colder - I can't imagine being here in the summer, but I assume it would be much less pleasant.

That being said, each time we've been here has been great. Good service, excellent food - I typically get some kind of pasta, either shrimp and fire-roasted tomato pasta or brick oven four cheese mac with choice of additions, while my boyfriend orders the prime sandwich. All are excellent and surprisingly high quality for a pub/birdhouse, but the highlight is always the dessert... cookie dough filled chocolate flautas with ice cream. It's absolutely wonderful! Now that the weather is cooling off we hope to stop by some more in the near future."}
{"text":"There are three sections to sit, on the \"patio\" inside and Upstarts. Upstairs has it's own bar with lounge type seating and shaded High top tables. I sat on the patio there are tons of trees and plants that shade the table the only bad thing about sitting outside is the flies, they are terrible. 

There isn't a huge menu but everything sounds good! I had a tough time choosing what to order . I ordered the perch burger and it was average tasting.  My girlfriend had the citrus and shrimp salad. We shared BBQ Fried Chicken pizza it was the best part of the meal! I wish I would have ordered instead of the Burger."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is the atmosphere. The lighting is nice and the birds and checker boards are fun.  The parking is pretty conveniently located across the street. The food was outstanding. We had the bacon/cheddar burger and The Wall Street salad. The service was the reason I did not give this place 5 stars. One of the drinks we ordered never came and it took quite a while for our food to come, though the waitress was nice. That said, it's a beautiful place to sit and relax and enjoy music and a drink or game while you wait."}
{"text":"I haven't had a bad beer or dish here yet. The tamales, chicken fingers, grilled salmon salad and tots have all been slam dunks! Their peach beer is awesome! The ambience with all of the rescue birds and trees throughout the space make it unique and a fun place to bring visitors!"}
{"text":"We went last night to the Perch. Tried to make reservations and couldn't  get through, there were eight of us. The food was very good but disappointed we were seated at a table covered in bird poop and the outside propane heaters were not filled and kept going out.  I would recommend to management before you open maybe clean the tables off and check your heaters."}
{"text":"We were invited here for a friend's birthday party. Right off the bat we were not feeling the customer service. Reservations were made for upstairs near the band. We were seated over gravel on a mis-matched set up on a corner downstairs. Service? MIA. We frequently found ourselves going to the bar to order drinks. We cautiously ordered food....

Would take too long to highlight all the imperfections in the food. Suffice to say that it was greasy and not worth the price.  Overall, there are much better options, even for groups, in the area. We finally left and went to a different establishment were we finished off the night!"}
{"text":"Meh. That's exactly how to describe this place. It's absolutely adorable, great place for a drink...the food? Not so much. When we arrived they said the bar upstairs was open seating but not that there was a limited menu. Ordered a drink and headed back downstairs. The duck burger had no flavor. Ordered a side of balsamic reduction to choke it down. Brussels sprouts for an appetizer was decent, the sliced meat in it added an odd flavor. 

Our server was really sweet but everything was really slow. 

I'll be back for brunch - always have to give everything a second chance."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place opening a couple of months ago. Finally, a cool place to enjoy quality craft beers in Chandler. But I'm sad to say that this place keeps disappointing over and over. I keep telling myself that these poor customer service incidences were all circumstantial, and isolated occurrences, but they were not. In fact it seems to be the trend. 

This is the incident today that really pissed me off... Arrived at the Perch around 5:30, the wait was about 45 mins. I totally understand, so my friend and I go to the bar area. We stand in front of 2-3 bartenders and no response for 5 mins... So we said ok, maybe we'll have better luck upstairs. We get upstairs, and it wasn't that busy at the bar, there were 6 bar stools open, we sit down hoping to get the attention of the bartender, there were 2 at the time. We get no greeting, not even a look from these cool dudes... One of the bartenders even wiped the bar in front of my buddy with no look, or interaction of any sort. Shame on the PERCH. So after about 12 mins looking like thirsty idiots, we decide to go to Santan Brewery. We had a much better experience... And finally a beer. 

I'm a craft beer trader, and I am always at the local bars here in town sampling craft brews, but I will never mention or support this place. I would recommend Hungry Monks- Watering hole- San Tan and Wilderness brewing before going to the perch."}
{"text":"Good service. Cool concept with the birds. I Loved the turkey club sandwich, it was by far one of my favorite!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Beer wasn't very cold and selection was not great, especially for a pub!?!?  Christy was our server and was amazing!  Never had to wait for s drink and grabbed is a table right away in downstairs bar. Best server ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here late Friday night to enjoy our friend's upcoming Birthday. We knew we would just be ordering drinks so we headed upstairs to get a lounge area. Our server was great and able to handle our group that ordered very eclectic drinks. They have a large selection of beers: ales, sours, ciders, etc., and everything is pretty reasonably priced.
The only part that can be a bit difficult is that more drinks are offered downstairs than upstairs so sometimes our server had to run downstairs and back to accommodate our drink types."}
{"text":"Craft beers here are awesome, everything we ate was topnotch! Fish tacos,creamy carnita cheese dip, Arepas (venezuelan sliders) were all awesome! Big plus if you're into Parrots too!"}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this place. Love the layout and atmosphere...anytime but the middle of summer and when it's super cold outside. Problems with mostly outdoor joints! the food has pretty much consistently been delicious every time I've been (more than just my check-ins) and I really enjoy their craft beers (as in the perch drafts but they do have a great selection of others). It gets crowded and you will have to wait. Forrrrrever. EV.ER! Oh and if you are terrified of birds, I suggest anywhere else....

Favorites: Tater tots, margarita pizza and the desert blossom saison!"}
{"text":"First, I don't understand the negative reviews. It appears some people are too picky to eat out and maybe should stay home. The prices of the food are reasonable considering they make everything from scratch, including the beer, pizza dough, etcetera. Which makes the food delicious by the way. 

I had the brussel sprout and pork belly pizza. It was delicious. The brussel sprouts weren't overcooked so were good. The pork belly was crispy and the crust was crisp and not soggy. The menu is not too big. My advice is to choose items where you actually like the ingredients. Then you may be happy. 

The service was friendly and fast, Brandon the bartender took care of us well. We went slightly past lunch time but they were decently busy. They are still looking for more good servers, so if you are looking for a cool place to work check it out. We met the owner who is pretty neat, she is a surgical nurse in addition to opening a new restaurant. 

The owner Rebecca also rescues exotic birds, including abused and disabled birds which are housed at the restaurant. The birds are not in the way of seating or food but by the entrance. They are nice and funny, the parrots talk and dance. The bar is open to the extensive patio seating area, which is lovely and well shaded. 

All in all, a place I will be going to again."}
{"text":"A really great find in downtown chandler. Very cool outdoor scenery, great staff, really good food. Tim, the manager, was super attentive to our table, and our server Nolan was awesome. Had a burger, cooked to perfection, and the wife had the chicken tacos, which she said were great. Very good drink prices. $5 glasses of wine, which were very good, as well as other offerings. Definitely will be back to try other things. If your looking for a fun new place, with a great outdoor feel, come here."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings and reviews of The Perch. First, my unoriginal comment is that it is difficult to find. However, it has a cool vibe and interesting concept with all the unique birds chillin on the patio. Let's move inside....where it felt almost as if it wasn't air conditioned?!? I was quite uncomfortable inside due to the temperature. The food wasn't really all that either. Tried the fish tacos, it felt more like fried batter with a bit of fish thrown in. Nevertheless, the service was sarcastic and friendly which I definitely enjoyed, same with my tasty Moscow mule. If I'm ever back in no mans land (chandler) I would return for drinks but not food, and never again in the summer."}
{"text":"Outstanding open air brewery. Food was great, prices appropriate and service attentive and polite. We were asked if we wanted to wait for a table or sit upstairs at the roof top bar. We found a nice 4 top without any wait. The place is pretty amazing with the rescued birds. Made for a wonderful lunch. Both times I've been there I've been impressed."}
{"text":"The perch is a favorite local spot. Almost like a mini zoo with birds of all kinds on the surroundings. Have a large outside area with misters and a smaller inside area with AC. Have some tasty food here including the pub pretzels with delicious cheese not pictured(ate it to fast!) plenty of other bar/restaurants within walking to distance  to hop around too."}
{"text":"Service was good but not impressed with the \"late night\" menu.  Was in at 930 and asked for something a little healthier from the regular menu but was told no because they only had the late night menu avail even though the late night menu states 10pm-close.  (Server said it was a missprint.)  I almost wondered if I would have gotten a table outside rather than in the bar,  if I could have actually ordered something I could eat.  So, maybe add something to your late night menu that's not so unhealthy or maybe just fix your \"late night\" menu."}
{"text":"I had heard of this place but didn't discover it until a couple weeks ago. I've been here 3 times and will continue to make it a regular spot. I love the ambiance, the service, the food is delicious and great drinks! Creme brûlée martini is off the chain! Great fresh fish tacos and bomb chicken Cesar salad. I highly recommend. The birds add a unique character. I'm an animal lover, so this place is a sweet little gem."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! We discovered this place through Yelp & are so glad we did! We first went there on a weeknight and loved the birds and the ambiance that it put off. We first tried there hummus platter which is so good, another time there sausage platter which is very good, and than we tried there cheese and meat board which is a bit expensive for my liking but it's oh so good! I always get there pork sliders because they are to good to be true and my boyfriend first got the French dip which is awesome but now he creates his lobster Mac & I don't even like lobster but there lobster Mac is to die for! I can't wait to go back soon!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so much fun. The kids love the birds that are throughout the patio. The upstairs patio is such a fun place for Happy hour but you have to make sure to get there early or you won't get a seat. 

All the food we've tried has been delicious. 

If you can't decide on what beer to get, try a flight"}
{"text":"The food here has always been good. The tater tots have always been spectacular, but now the rest of the food is all grown up too. Their beers-on-tap list is sure to impress, and the staff treats you like family. We always bring our out-of-town guests here. I love this place!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cool with the birds and everything. Food and drinks are good but not spectacular. I did have a really good old fashioned there once but it was $12, more than my meal."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 or 4 times...Great selection of micro beers..Service is good..Appetizers are awesome...And hearing the birds is a plus..Great atmosphere and vibe..especially in the evening.."}
{"text":"Went to brunch with the family today, and absolutely loved our experience at The Perch. Between the 4 of us we tried the Huevos perchero, the biscuits and gravy, the Brizza (breakfast pizza), and the Breakfast calzone. Everything was really good, the biscuits and gravy was definitely the highlight and the biscuits were house made, with cheddar and roasted peppers so it really made the dish something spectacular. Our server was really friendly and helpful! And the entire meal only took us about 45 mins tops from when we were seated to when we left. Great experience, and we're looking forward to coming back to try their dinner selection soon!"}
{"text":"We had been to the perch previously and had a pretty bad experience with food quality and the amount of time it took to receive our food on the rooftop bar. 
Some good friends of ours wanted to try it and encouraged us to give it another shot.
We arrived at 6:45 and put our name on the list.
We were seated at 7:20.
Our appetizers of the pork queso was brought out and I we were told our food would be coming out shortly.
We waited. And waited. And waited.
I finally spoke with our waiter and let him know I was getting worried because we had reservations at a club with friends at 9.
I was promised they would be quick and that the manager was aware of how long it was taking and he would make it right.
The food was brought to the table and everything was there except my Mac and cheese.
I asked them to check on it and was told it is coming and that the manager was comping the Mac and cheese.
We asked for the checks finally at 7 minutes before 9 and still no Mac and cheese.
Everyone was able to eat dinner except me.
A hour and forty minutes should've been plenty of time to order food but I guess at the perch it's not.
Won't be giving it a third try.
I am hungry and irritated as hell"}
{"text":"I came with a group of friends after work around 10:30pm. Very lively atmosphere with various birds in cages for display. We sat upstairs next to the bar, I loved the outdoor seating since it was a nice breezy night. A plus to any bars that allow you to try their beer before purchasing. :)"}
{"text":"The food was great. It's too bad the server Mike was very unfriended and snobby. This isn't Scottsdale, it's Chandler."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try The Perch for a while, and really wanted to love it. We must've passed the place a hundred times over the last few months without realizing it was there, as it's hidden from the main street and backs up to a residential area (odd). The entrance is quaint, and the downstairs dining area looked pretty nice with all the trees lit up and cages of rescued birds. \"A\" for ambience there. 

It was late in the evening so we headed upstairs to the rooftop bar, which is touted as a local \"hotspot\". I was thankful for the multiple heaters going on a chilly evening. The bar, however, was nothing impressive and the clientele wasn't what we were expecting, either. A bunch of 20-something's bragging about their run-ins with the law and comparing stories (local attorneys looking for clients need to hang here). The bartender spent more time cleaning the bar in preparation to leave for the night than waiting on customers. When we asked questions about the IPA and other brews, he had to ask a coworker. Overall, we weren't too impressed with the service...or the beer for that matter. 

If we ever return, it will be to try their food  and we will sit downstairs."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and we were immediately sat but preceded to wait 25-30 minutes to even have a server acknowledge us. The people next to us were sat after us and they already had drinks. The manager came over another 10 minutes later  and was extremely apologetic and took care of us, paid for our first round of drinks as well as an appetizer. The atmosphere was definitely the best part but if they stepped their service up I wouldn't have any complaints other then the food being slightly overpriced. Will definitely be back to see if we have a better experience!"}
{"text":"Normally this is a great place but today it sucked. Was there for over 20 minutes and wasn't even approached by a server even though I went and asked 2 if there was a server for our section. Neither one sent anyone over to take our drink order or offered themselves. When we were leaving and I voiced my displeasure over not being served I was offered an apology but not an offer for service as we walked out. 
No sense in spending money at a place that apparently doesn't need it or want it when there are plenty of other places in downtown Chandler to grab a drink and dinner."}
{"text":"Although we've noticed the prices have gone up since the last time we were here we still enjoyed our food and the wide selection of beers that they had. It is quite novel to see all the birds outside and I really enjoy the signs about being bitten If we missed behaved ourselves with the birds. This is a really cool place to take Tourister out of town folks and I always make sure to stop by when I'm in downtown Chandler"}
{"text":"Love this spot, I've been three times now.  Twice in the day, once at night.  The day scene is cool; food and drinks come out fast, plenty of room to sit.  Had a nice beer flight...the rosemary IPA was my absolute fav!!!  Came back one night, the ambience was totally different w live music and more great food and drinks.  Would recommend to take your out of town friends here for a fun experience"}
{"text":"Such a cute idea, but I do feel kinda bad for the birds hahaha. We went last night and they were all sleeping and the bar was packed. More on the expensive side, but the drinks were pretty good. We ordered a fruit and veggie plate (12$), and when it finally came after like 25 minutes, it was super warm. That's the only thing I'd say was a negative, other then that it's a cool place to check out."}
{"text":"Our first visit to The Perch had an inauspicious start when they had no record of the reservation I made for our party of 5.  Luckily, we were early enough that they were able to seat us without a wait.  Thankfully, things went up from there.  Our server Krystal was awesome!!!!  She was knowledgeable about the drafts on the menu and was very helpful with food selections.  We started with the Jalapeno Marmalade Tots.  Flavor was great, but wish they had been crispy.  Our party had a Margarita Pizza, Brick Oven Tamale, Fish Tacos, and two Perch Burgers.  My fish tacos were yummy, but could have used more of the salsa.  The Buffalo fries were fabulous.  They were the crispy I wanted our tots to be.  Great flavor, too.  No complaints about the other food items.  Wonderful selection of draft beer and a cool atmosphere.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place through friends that live across the state (I'm from Scottsdale) Decided to do a staycation in Chandler and hit a few Breweries down there ... This was on the list for late night dinner and Brews.

The moment you step beyond the Gates you feel like you're in a different place ... its like walking into a tropical paradise... trees all over the place, Misters were blasting, giving it a rainforest feel ... not to mention being surrounded by Exotic Birds. Amazing atmosphere. 

Estimated 45 minute wait for dinner ... Not a problem when you can enjoy their Very unique brews on the roof top bar area. Big fan of the Ginger MoFo (never thought i'd hear those words come from my mouth)

25 min later we were called and taken to our table. tropical trees to our right, exotic birds behind us and a pop'n bar to the other side of us ... service was a bit slow ... but they were busy as hell ... and we didn't mind as the atmosphere was enjoyable, relaxing, and fun. almost felt like i was on vacation in a tropical location.

Our server was awesome. he suggested foods that were good, knew the menu up and down, and when we asked about different dishes he didn't initially suggest, he was (very) honest.

only downfall of this place ... too damn far from Scottsdale !"}
{"text":"$25 I'll never get back. This place came highly recommended but I was left underwhelmed. I felt the menu was pretty pricey for typical bar food. If a lunch time sandwich is going to be $9 it better be amazing. Adding more standard grocery style deli meat does not make it amazing. The house made chips tasted burned but were chewy at the same time. I didn't even want to finish them. My husband ordered the fish tacos which were pretty good but again in my opinion over priced. 

I was also unimpressed with the staff. We went for a late lunch and upon entering the courtyard for the first time it was unclear where we should go. After walking around and finally figuring it out I was annoyed that the restaurant was completely empty and not one person from the staff came out to tell us where to come in. Service was fast and efficient but it felt like we were an inconvenience. 

I will say, the birds were cool."}
{"text":"Great fish tacos! Turns out to be a good location for kids because of all the birds. No crayons but they came up with a pen and paper. Kids cheese pizza was enjoyed by the six year old while dad had the fish tacos and uncle bears Belgian style beer. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"This place is super cool! Doubling as a bird rescue, the Perch is an indoor-outdoor pub serving up some delicious bar food, drinks and atmosphere. My cousins had recommended this Chandler-based restaurant for lunch on a trip to Phoenix, so we decided to follow up on their suggestion and give this place a shot. We were very happy we did!

For starters, I love the beer menu here! They have a number of local options to choose from, and the flights are build-your-own style! You can choose 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more shot-sized beer samples all for one great price per beer! Of course there are other sizes as well in case you just want one big glass, but as someone who loves to sample different beers, this was perfect! Nevertheless, I was the DD, so I only sampled two beers. Both were delicious!

For food, we started with jalapeño tots. Boy were they spicy but so delicious!! I highly recommend if you can handle the spice (it is covered with ranch, which cools it down a bit, but I must emphasize that this dish packs some heat). For my entree, I opted for a gourmet grilled
cheese which had fried cheese and melted cheese in between two pieces of bread (and plain tots on the side). SO GOOD! The other members of my party also really loved their meals.

Service here is fantastic as well, and it feels great to know that this place doubles as a bird rescue, so your meal is going to a good cause. The ambiance here feels very much like a bird sanctuary as all the outdoor seating is surrounded by the birds they save (in cages of course). There are even some hilarious cockatoos and parrots who will whistle at you or try to get your attention by saying \"hello\".

The only reason not to eat here is if Alfred Hitchcock's movie scarred you for life. Otherwise the food, drinks, service, ambiance, and prices are all phenomenal. And they have a great cause! Give The Perch a go!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pub/brewery in town! The birds are adorable, and the cause is great. They are all rescued birds so keep it going by visiting them. Not that they need my help, the beer and food is enough to make anyone come back! Their Oatmeal Stout, Cinnamon Nut Brown?, strawberry cream, and Irish Red is to die for. The food is really good too, fresh with great taste. Perfect to combine with the many awesome beers and drinks to choose from. Don't get me started with the people, they are very approachable and will always help you pick a drink or treat you like one the crew! Love this place, this is my go-to bar!!

Edit: So I have gone back numerous times as of lately. The beer selection and taste has taken a dive. I keep going back because of amazing prior experiences and the cause. But I'm very disappointed. I bragged to all my friends about it and now they think I'm crazy.... and have no taste in beer. Really upset. None of the before mentioned flavors are there and it's been bland and not enjoyable flavors. Please fix."}
{"text":"Nice little place tucked away in an alley. Just opened about a year ago and just started brewing beer 6 months ago. Looks like they are on the right track. Beer is good and their food is quality stuff. We had the sausage plate which was homemade sausage and mustards. Staff knows their beers and is very friendly"}
{"text":"A perfect spot to enjoy food and beverage with family and friends. Food is delicious, beer selection is good, and the open atmosphere is very inviting and fun. I mostly enjoy the roof top but downstairs is also great with trees and birds. It's a relaxing change from the diamond cut steel and glass architecture of down town Chandler. Our server Amy was an absolute doll, on top of keeping glasses full, and smiles on our faces. I will be back again soon and I highly recommend The Perch to everyone."}
{"text":"Cool little place here! Delicious sangria and a great beer selection. I had the fish tacos which were super tasty -- nice and spicy (but not overly hot) sauce with a pineapple slaw. My friend had their burger, with veggie patty substitute. She loved her meal as well, decently priced and super friendly service. And the dessert.... chocolate tortillas stuffed with cookie dough & deep fried. Yum."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to visit this brewery based on the reviews here on Yelp. I have been really disappointed. We were dining with little kids and wanted to eat early. My party called ahead for a reservation @ 5 pm on a Friday evening. We got there and were told we would wait 20 minutes so we got some beers and lemonades and walked around checking out the birds. 30 minutes passed and no seating. Now mind you there was a table set up right by the front entrance that would easily accommodate our party. That table sat empty (for hours) the entire time we were there. When I asked what the delay was after 30 min they apologized and said it wouldn't be much longer. Maybe 30 minutes at the most. So we waited. By now it's 6 pm if we went any other place and we would wait an hour so we figured just wait. BIG MISTAKE in hindsight.  We ended up ordering Mac n Cheese for the kids off of the bar and got them fed at least.  We were finally seated at 7 pm. A full two hours after our reservation was supposed to be. 
This was incredibly the worst treatment I have ever received. I was even less than impressed when I heard the hostess talking to another staff member about my party. Yes she was confronted and apologized. We did tip the waitstaff who served us dinner because we felt it wasn't his fault for the waiting/overbooking EPIC disaster. If this place was so overbooked then they should have just said it by giving us a realistic timeframe. This would allow us the opportunity to decide whether or not we stayed or left. I will never come here again. Huge disappointment. Btw the food was just mehhh."}
{"text":"The Perch did a 'soft opening' on Valentine's day which was pretty cool.  We got their early knowing it would get crowded and got some great seats.  We started on the roof which is set up nicely but unfortunately there were issues with the bar varnish? and so they had some plastic over it.  There were some other great spots to hang upstairs but we saw they only had four taps up top.  We then sat downstairs near the bar and really enjoyed the vibe of the place.  We met tons of nice people, many of which were from the brewing arena.  We also got to take a great tour of the new brew equipment in the side yard area with all new beautiful stainless equipment that soon they should have up and running.  Though they are not brewing onsite yet, the handles on the wall will not disappoint.  They did a great job selecting beers with everything from Sex Panther to fruit infused brews to hard ciders to Chimay,  The food was OK but needs some work.  I was not a fan of the pizzas due to the dough they used and the beer sausage was dry and grainy.  The Green Chili Pork Torta was pretty darn good though. For an opening night I was most impressed with the service.  THEY GOT SLAMMED and packed to the gills quickly and instead of it feeling chaotic and frenzied, there was just a fun busy feeling to it.  My drink was never empty and everything came quickly.  The open courtyard area is done very well and the rescued birds that are there are fun and certainly thoughtfully placed considering it is a food establishment.  About the only thing wrong with the layout is the need for more bathrooms.  Looking forward to heading back to this place when a few kinks are ironed out.  Kudos to them for a great opener."}
{"text":"Ok well I am giving 2 stars and not 1 based on the outcome and birds. We arrived (party of 5) on a Friday night at 6:00. I expected to wait long because well it was Friday. We sat down at our table at 6:50. It was cold and we asked if there were any heaters around. Nope none. We glance on the second level and there are TONS of heaters not even being used so that bewildered me. Our server was missing majority of the freaking time. Never could answer our questions. Didn't fill our waters. I am 8 months pregnant so of course I'm always hungry. After I saw the neighbor table get their drinks, appetizers and meal before we did, I started to get ticked. I asked at 8:00 if our food was close to being ready. Server says, \"ummm I don't know\". Ok. By 8:30 I'm really wondering where our server is. 8:45 we get our food and I start talking to the girl (not our server) who served us what was going on with the almost 2 hour wait. At that moment our actual server just basically runs away leaving her to deal with us. We are all mad. Another guy comes over and asks us the problem and then says, \"make sure your food is hot and edible\". What the?!?! Food was cold and we were over it. Didn't even want it. Manager comes over and we explain the whole thing. He was nice and said customer service is a big issue right now and he had just recently taken over. We didn't eat the food nor did we have to pay for it but what a waste of a night. I hope they're able to get it together because it's a fun place and the food looks like it was good. Sad."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere! It's the middle of summer and we would've been comfortable outside as its well shaded and there are a lot of fans. The birds are adorable and some are quite friendly. The food was amazing and there are a lot of craft beer choices, too. The staff are very friendly and check on you a lot but not too much. I felt very comfortable and enjoyed my time."}
{"text":"It pains me to leave a mediocre review for this place because the atmosphere is one of a kind, but we have now had 4 less than satisfactory experiences here, & will probably not be returning again.  I have worked in the service industry in the past, as has my husband, & we thought we would give the employees the benefit of the doubt & come a few more times (because again, the atmosphere is amazing!), but 4 bad experiences is just too many.  

Bad experience #1 - We attended their advertised Halloween party with costume contest with two friends.  We all got decked out & we're excited for the potential of winning a weekend getaway to an Arizona brewery or winery (I forget which one).  The General Manager was supposed to be judging the contest.  She got so hammered that she didn't even judge any costumes!  I bet the trip (if it even existed) was given to a friend or regular.  Bad form...

Bad experience #2 - we were there on a Saturday afternoon with friends on the rooftop bar & our server forgot 3 separate orders: wings & a drink that we had to remind her about, & finally a sausage and cheese board that we decided to not even mention to see if she'd bring it & instead she just brought us the check. I ordered a vodka water with lemon and lime and she came back with limes only and said \"sorry there aren't lemons up here.\"  Ok then??  Go downstairs or send someone to grab some?  It was fairly busy, so we gave her a break.

Bad experience #3 - my husband and I came back the next day to pick up our car, & decided to grab lunch.  It was dead, very slow.  My husband ordered a burger and I ordered the chicken Caesar salad.  After 30 minutes of waiting for our fairly simple order, my husbands burger & tots ($12) arrived ice cold (we assume it was left in the window for some time).  Also, half the lettuce in my salad ($10) was brown and slimy.  My husband sent his burger back and when it came out again, the burger was fine but it was clear they had just used the same cold tots!  Lazy!  I decided not to even mention the lettuce in my salad and just pick it out.  They did comp his burger and the server was nice, but for the prices they charge, we expected much more.

Bad experience #4 - we decided to give this place one last shot, & the friends we were having lunch with wanted to go here.  We sat down and when asking the server what the White Blend wine tasted like, she very clearly lied, as she had no clue what it tasted like... Maybe offer a taste or ask someone next time?  We also waited 30+ min for an order of tots & a pretzel with cheese.  

My overall review of this place: for the prices they charge, they need to up their employee knowledge of their menu as well as food ticket times.  They are lucky the venue is so unique!  The extra star is for the venue, otherwise, I would have given them 2 stars.  Maybe new management is in order?"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Great Beers. Decent wines. That's about it. Had to seat ourselves and walk to the bar for attention. We three customers only and several employees shooting the breeze at the bar. Other than that, service was ok. Cheese and Sausage plates were good, not great. The little \"brie\" triangle had the foil marks...obviously grocery store bought. Crostini and Pretzel bread were very good. Bill of $60.45 was fine. Paid with a $100 bill and got $39 change not $39.55. Not a big deal, but kind of dishonest. Just took it off my $12 tip so the server kind of screwed himself.  All in all not a bad experience, but nowhere near the hype."}
{"text":"Good first visit.  

We liked the outdoor seating on the bottom floor and thought the aviarys added a nice ambiance to the experience.  The place was already very busy at 5:30pm on Sat night, but we were greeted immediately and seated within 5 minutes.  Some people might be put off by the busyness and noise of the place.  But it was acceptable based on the number of folks being seated, eating and ordering from the extensive beer list.  

We had the sausage plate for an appetizer - would do it again.

We split a mushroom and onion burger for dinner - would do it again

Our son had the pepperoni pizza and after we all \"tested\" it - it too was a tasty dinner.  

Beers were nice-n-cold and came out quickly.  Food was hot and also arrived quickly.  

About the only service issue was the fact that the server forgot twice to bring us water to drink.  Once he'd corrected that issue everything was good.  

I will go back again."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about this place and decided to try it out for dinner while my Mom was in town visiting. It was Friday between 6-8, a standard busy time for ending happy hour and dinner. We checked in with the hostess and was told it would be a 30 minute wait. We headed up to the rooftop bar for a drink while we waited. A really nice server helped us find a spot and we got served up there right away. No sooner after we ordered our drinks, they text and said our table was ready. We quickly cashed out and headed back down. After we were sat it took approx. 20 minutes for any server to acknowledge us. We ordered the pub tots and a salad and dish and chips. I asked for no tomatoes on the salad but it had tomatoes anyway. Our actual server checked on us one time after the food came out. This was not the person who brought or the food, or cleaned up our plates. After we were done eating, we waited at least another 20 minutes for the bill. The bill was not correct and we were charged for an item we didn't order. After approaching the hostess stand to get it corrected, a \"manager\" came to the table with the corrected bill. The concept of the place is great, but they need to work on the service."}
{"text":"Fun vibe, just wish the food was better not the worst but could be better. They could offer some healthier options as well. Service and drinks are always delicious."}
{"text":"ARGH. I really really want to like this place. The concept is great. The patio is neat - and hey - they have one of my favorite things - brunch!

Hold your horses!

First, let's start with brunch. Sat outside. Probably 3 tables that were taken when I went. Wait, is there wait service? Do we have to go inside? Flag someone down, have to point out the table is dirty (as most were - and we were trying to find one by a fan as it was a hotter day). Got it wiped down. Server vanishes. I am thirsty! Server finally comes back, we order drinks. I want a pineapple mimosa. What came back was a mimosa with orange juice and pineapple. Not a huge deal, but if you don't know, ask! But then there is a wait .. again... 

Food - well, the menu pretty much isn't great. I ordered the Surf & Turf (not sure what I was thinking as I don't like shrimp - but I guess I thought it was Steak and Eggs so same diff). Steak came in cold, with get the distinct flavor of Montreal Steak Seasoning (e.g. I could have made this at home?) and the egg whites I asked for were ok. The potatoes (says smashed on the menu) showed up as these mini-french fries that I think were an attempt at home fries - but they were hard, cold and stale. Yuck. Overall, not going for brunch again. 

Went for lunch last week. Ordered a couple of apps with a friend to try something new. Lobster wontons were ok. Not stuffed very full - but tasted ok. Could use more cream cheese? Arepas - let's just say we sent them back. The pork was just flavorless - and maybe the lack of flavor is why there is a chimichurri - but I am not sure how to describe them other than I really would avoid anything that says carnitas. 

Beer selection is good - and staff is knowledgeable (at the bar at least) and space inside and out is outstanding. I just wish the menu could make me happier."}
{"text":"Soooo overpriced! None of us enjoyed our food. 19$ pasta dish was sent back because it was cold. The chicken and gnocchi soup was way too spicy and not served with bread. Disappointed."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was unique and relaxing. The server Lauren was very friendly and helpful,  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed lunch at The Perch.  Service was a little slow but staff was friendly and the atmosphere was great. Fish tacos were fabulous! Lots of fun choices on the menu it was hard to chose. Wine selection available for non beer drinkers. Planning to return for brunch and live music on the weekend."}
{"text":"It's a shame when the good service was over shadowed by our server's poor judgement.  We were alone on one side of the roof, sitting comfortably under one of the heat lamps.  Then another couple sits behind us and without consulting us, asks the server to turn down the heat lamp.  The server then, still without asking us, turns the heat lamp nearly off.  Then to top it all off another couple that came in well after us, sitting across from us, flashed us their phone saying the temperature was 60 degrees and to shut the F! up.  Seriously.  Between the server and the two neighboring couples that arrived well after us being so completely ignorant, we will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is mostly outside, which I figure I should have known, but I didn't and almost froze even right by a heater. Don't make the same mistake as I did - bring a jacket. 

The waitstaff is very hipster-ish and too cool to hustle. Drinks are expensive. Food is expensive. 

But the pretzels and cheese - oh my heaven - are good!! Might even convince myself to go back (with a jacket) just for that... 

PS - I didn't see any birds..."}
{"text":"No matter what time of day and what I'm in the mood for the perch is always so yummy! We had brunch there the other day and it was amazing. I love their beer they brew as well. The service is pretty good but nothing beats the ambiance there. The rooftop is a lot of fun especially when they have live music going."}
{"text":"There is much to love about this place:..the atmosphere, the beers.. the off-the-beaten-path location. Unfortunately all those are overshadowed by the inept staff and mediocre meal offerings. 
This is not a -rush-to-judgment. I have tried this place three times over as many months, but each visit was about the same. They are busy, so I guess their motivation to improve may be lacking - time will tell."}
{"text":"Came for a birthday dinner and never received our meal. We even reminded them of the pizza and they said they'd make another one. 30 mins went by and we never got it. The waitress rarely checked the table. I had to ask for a water refill both times. When I asked about the pizza whje getting the bill, she said she'd take it off. DUH. We never even got it! Will not return."}
{"text":"Always love this local gem. Good food and drinks. I love that they rescue birds. Nice location downtown."}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks! The owners are awesome people, they are often there and walk around talking to customers! Food comes out super fast, even when they're busy. Fun games to play while having a drink or waiting for food. And it's a local business!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Sundress IPA and spinach, artichoke pizza =delicious. Our server Robbie was fantastic. Very knowledgeable and personable. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Interesting place with the bird motif... ! 

My issue with this place is the fact that it's basically in down town Chandler with many other competing bars and restaurants and this place doesn't do enough to rise above the crowd. If I'm going to do an evening with friends in downtown Chandler, we MIGHT go to this place... but it's certainly not on the list of \"can't miss\" places for the evening down there. The food is decent, the value is fair and the service is fine... if it weren't for the bird motif, I'm just not sure that there is much more to differentiate it from the other venues."}
{"text":"I know this place is just getting started... but WOW.  The hummus is fa bu lous.   The fruit/goat cheese dip is a must---and take some home. YUM. The food is good, yet the menu is still teeny, I'm sure that'll grow with the place.  The Big deal here... the atmosphere just does it all.   I feel like I just fell down some wormhole and landed on an amazing Caribbean or Jamaican patio.  Birds and all....   Is that my long lost pet parrot Bob over there?  I love it.   This place is so refreshing!!!  There's a roof top patio - looks great for doing some drinkin, maybe after work for me. I will be back. Thanks to the owners for such a cool, fresh and unique concept!"}
{"text":"Ok this is definitely a great spot to come and chill. Very relaxed atmosphere greeted promptly. They anything with the green chili...I think they have grandma cooking in the back.  Our server was good..looked a little over extended..maybe had a busy night but was friendly and took care of us.

Beers were great tonight to find a place where I liked everything I tried from IPA to Porters.

Keep up the service,beer and food feat job!"}
{"text":"What a fun place to eat and drink! Really nicely designed and decorated. The patio is full of trees with lights, intimate table seating and aviaries with birds....REAL birds. We thought they'd be noisy but they weren't at all, beautiful sounding actually. 
Now for the reason you're there. Craft beers galore and a well stocked liquor cabinet too. And the food....OMG, you must try the Duck Rueben, it sounds bizarre (and it is....a little) but it is sooo good. Smoked duck confit, slaw, wow. My date and I split the Rueben and a delicious burger of ground sirloin. We were too full for dessert, maybe next time just a dessert!"}
{"text":"I met my girlfriends here for drinks and apps. It was good. I enjoyed the outdoor atmosphere. It was really crowded around 7p on a Friday but cleared out by 8. They didn't have as many beer selections as I expected but had enough to choose from. Prices were decent, $2.50 for a 5 ounce taster of draft. I got the chicken egg rolls. They were good. Not out of this world but thy were good. Order extra dipping sauce as that made it better. Service was excellent. I'll be back and appreciate this pace for supporting our animals"}
{"text":"It's hard to properly review this place, considering that I was not here long and only ordered the pesto tots. They were great, albeit pretty heavily dressed in pesto. So much so that they became hard to eat. But, it was late night and they came out fast, so...

The atmosphere is exactly what I picture when I think of Arizona dining. It's entirely outdoors, with a very cool rooftop bar. White Christmas lights really add to the ambiance, as well as the uber fake appearance of the patrons (c'mon--it's AZ). 

The neatest part were the birds, which are rescues as I understand it. Pretty unique addition to a restaurant/bar."}
{"text":"Love the bizarre array of buildings, lush garden, and bevy of rescue exotic birds cawing loudly at you as you meander through the beer menu. Perch is tucked away behind the main downtown area and it has such epic promise. Our service was slow and spastic, but nice. The Bird Food, caramel popcorn, fried jalapeños, and bacon lardon was...weird and sticky. But, with the option to order lots of tiny beers to try a ton, some interesting menu items, and an awesome locale, I will so be back many a time."}
{"text":"Unique concept: live birds and home brews. Tasty apps/sandwiches and when the heck did tater tots get so tasty! 
Been there for lunch twice and would like to try for dinner on the upstairs patio. 
Wednesdays one of the cheese/meat boards is 1/2 off. 
Check this \"hidden\" gem."}
{"text":"I really wanted to enjoy this place.  First off, the place is adorable, very original n fun.. Great for kids and adults.. They have some good beer selections n the patio is fun. The food on the other hand was a major disappointment. We ordered the herb and goat cheese tots and beer cheese to start with.  Both were served cold and u can tell they were never heated properly to begin with. The tots must have been old because the cheese on top never even melted on them, and the herb stuff looked and tasted like bird doodie. The beer cheese soup must be sitting back in the kitchen at room temp because it was cold by the time i got it and so was the limp bacon hanging off of it.. The worst and scariest part was being served a cold prime rib dip and jus, after it came back reheated, it was just a soggy greasy mess. Im really sad about the whole ordeal because Michael the server was a sweetheart n totally deserves a great place to serve good craft food at. I left totally sick feeling and mad i give outlying places like this a chance. Why cant suburbia have decent food.. Back to the city i go, after i throw up..."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, wonderful patio.  Enjoyed their pizza, fish and chips, specialty tater tots.  Nothing disappoints, and the atmosphere is unique and pretty."}
{"text":"It's a cute atmosphere,  but the seating is weird.  There were tables open all over,  however they were telling people it was a good wait..  We decided to go upstairs and eat.  It's not the most comfortable seating,  just a weird combo.  Prices for beers aren't bad at all,  and the food was good but nothing special."}
{"text":"Love coming to this place for the atmosphere and local vibes. Kevin was our server and was great! Very courteous. Last couple of times before that, we sat at the bar.  Only downside is that it is small inside, so either sit out on the patio (which is awesome and has birds of all types outside) or sit at the bar.   Great food, can get pricey but it's fun once in awhile."}
{"text":"A unique establishment with an array of rescued exotic birds from around the world. Tons of seating inside and outside. Polite staff. Great food and an excellent beer selection."}
{"text":"This is a tough review for me.

On the one hand, the ambiance alone in this place is enough to warrant a return, especially in the good-weather months (I feel bad for this place in the summer, since it's basically all outdoors). 

And to add to that, The Perch's other big draw is its craft beer selection, with something like 25 craft taps, wine taps, a full bar, and a great happy hour.  The food is handmade, fresh ingredients, and inventive, not just your typical bar food either.

So what could possibly go wrong?

Well...a lot, unfortunately.  I've been there about 5 or 6 times.  Every time, the servers seem disjointed, flustered, unsure of the accuracy of the menus, it's kind of a mess sometimes in that respect.  And they're never sure how accurate their beer menus are.  I get that with rotating taps, there's not a way for a paper menu to be 100% accurate, but it's annoying to order a beer and hear \"Let me see if we still have it\" every single time.  Get a chalkboard like Angel's Trumpet.  Get a digital screen program like House of Brews.  Get SOMETHING.  

The food sounds so good.  I ordered a beer cheese and beer sausage pizza.  I've seen them making the sausage in house, so I know that's good.  And I've had the sausage plate, it's delicious.  But instead of having thick slices of the sausage, they give you some piddly crumbles of it.  And the beer cheese is watery and not at all conducive to something that should be on a pizza.  And the peppers are over-sauteed and slimy.  And the pizza was just...limp.  

And the \"Smoke\" Mushroom and Onion burger?  Man...I wanted it to be spectacular.  It looked like it was going to be when they brought it out.  But whatever they do to smoke these things, the smoke is the only thing you taste, it tastes charbroiled past the point of being good.  I was so sad, because I'm not even particularly picky with burgers.  I enjoy and respect a beautifully well-made burger (like at Rehab Burger), but I can get down on a shitty ol' cheeseburger too.  Unfortunately, this was neither.

I'm dying...DYING to like this place because of the location, the setting, the beer menu and the food selections.  But you can tell that they're in need of more restauarant-savvy people and bar-savvy people, because they're just kind of squandering all their potential.  

I'm still giving them 3 stars in the hopes that they turn it around, it's still a little bit new...but c'mon.  Get your shit straight, Perch."}
{"text":"Very cool place and the beers were pretty good.  Service not so much.  Went on weekend night to have a couple of drinks.  Started at the upstairs bar which was very crowded.  Took about 10 minutes standing at the bar to get a bartender's attention.  It looked like they only had one on staff.  Accidentally sat at a completely empty table in a private party area and were told to move in about a rude a manner as possible.  Went to downstairs bar and sat at completely empty high-top table.  Told we couldn't sit there either and needed to check with the hostess.  Were told there was a 30-35 minute wait although half of the tables were empty.  We just wanted a place to sit and have some drinks.  We weren't ordering food.  Found another almost empty area with tables and waited for the boot while we finished our drinks.  Fortunately, they left us alone but really poor and confusing service. Left early to walk to other bar in downtown Chandler (lots of good options).  The Perch needs to figure out that you won't be too successful with terrible service although the place is really interesting."}
{"text":"Pros: The food is tasty. They have a great menu selection and a unique, outdoor, atmosphere 

Cons: the service is terrible. I've been here multiple times over the past year, and the service has gotten worse each time. The birds get really loud at times and sound like they're dying. The restaurant is also located between a dilapidated building and a hair salon. You are literally 2 feet from the salons side doors."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant.  Good food, a little overpriced but great quality.  Is a bird sanctuary so birds can be a little load, but it's kind of peaceful."}
{"text":"I attempted to try The Perch for the 3rd time last night but after not being acknowledged after over 15 minutes I decided to leave and take my business elsewhere. I did not have great experiences the first 2 times I was there, but I figured it take time for a new gastropub to work out the kinks. The second time I was there I had adequate service and the food and beer were pretty good so I figured it would be even better this time, but I apparently mistaken. It would have been nice to have a service staff member or managment stop by our table while we sat waiting, but they were too busy to take care of us I guess. I did not receive any attention from an employee until I decided to walk out and he just asked \"is everything o.k.\". The same server stood at the hostess stand and was high fiving customers as they left, while we waited for to be served. On a positive note we did go to another a wine lounge within walking distance from The Perch and had excellent service, food, and drink. Great potential though."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE the atmosphere & the rescue bird sanctuary.  Most of our experiences at The Perch (of which there have been many) have been wonderful but last night was really horrible.  We confirmed a reservation for 11 for 7pm 3x....including yesterday morning and yet when we arrived we had to wait 30min for the table to be set up and then we had to sit downstairs despite confirming w/ actual human beings twice (the other was via email to Maggie the manager that was not returned) that we would be upstairs w/ the love music. Two of the 3 grilled cheese sandwiches ordered had virtually no cheese and the bread was hard as a rock - both uneaten & those individuals went w/ out meals.  Mac & Cheese with virtually no cheese - uneaten, burgers overcooked, excuses about why there were no appetizer plates made, a $16 meat & cheese board with literally 8 little triangles of salami....that is it - not served w/ crackers as the menu described & about 12 cubes of cheese and a huge pile of vegetables. Had We wanted a salad, we would have ordered one.  Drinks were incorrect and when brought to the attention of the server we were met with \"no, they are right.\" The attitude of both the server and the manager were flippant and while the menu items were taken off the bill, the \"sorry\" lacked any sort of sincerity at all.  The fried pickles & peppers were great.  Seems since he menu change things have gone downhill.  Really disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Love this place for their craft beers. Their food is pretty good too! But our last visit was phenomenal due to our experiences with the staff. Our server was so awesome and friendly, I just had to give her a review on here. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"This place is Bomb. Definitely go here. Great food and an excellent beer menu. The house beer label is very good. I had the grapefruit IPA and the raspberry porter. Both fantastic."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, great food, great drinks (specialty and their own craft brew), great service, and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been here once for lunch, once for dinner, and once for late night drinks, and can honestly say I've enjoyed everything about it each time. The food, atmosphere,  location,  and of course beer is great. I can't wait to see what the brewery side of it has in stored for the future. If I had to recommend something off the menu,  it would probably be the prime rib dip sandwich."}
{"text":"I agree with previous reviews in that it certainly is a unique atmosphere. Very jungle-esque.

Pro's: good service,  I liked the beer he recommended,  the birds are pretty cool to see, the bathroom was clean, and the misters keep it cool. 

Con's: the bathroom situation confused me. There is one men,  one women and they're located outside with a community sink. One bathroom is just not enough for us ladies. Waiting in line outside sucked,  too, cuz it's hot and there were no misters in this area. I was underwhelmed by my veggie sandwich and tots- I paid $9 for some smeared hummus and veggies in between 2 slices of bread, and some tots that cost $1.something for a whole frozen bag at the store. Ehh... 

Overall it was a cool place, maybe I'll go back when it's less crowded so there is less bathroom lines."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Food is a little over priced for what you get but the place makes you feel like you are no where near a city.  Love the atmosphere.  
Don't like the \"exposed\" bathrooms.  I'll just go home."}
{"text":"So disappointed!  Arrived there for the first time, and about to walk in when the Cafe next door said they were closing 2 p.m. on Saturday and would have to repark somewhere else.  No signage to indicate the parking lot had certain daytime hours and not usable for The Perch.  No good parking thereafter so drove around and around and almost left, but found a spot.  Then went in via the back entrance to The Perch.  Ran past 3 employees who never greeted us nor directed us to the front section of patio, but we finally figured it out on our own only to have hostess not welcome us.  When we asked her how to get inside The Perch as it was too hot to sit outside for us, she not only looked at us oddly, but rudely remarked (in a voice like we were stupid) while pointing to a door to a door behind us, and said \"Right there, where the door is marked Entrance.\"   We had to turn around to see it.  Wow - what a greeting!  Got inside and sat at bar and was not greeted or served in first 10 min so we decided the vibe was not friendly or impressive and it was not meant to be and left.  All the staff needs a lesson in how to greet their customers and treat them like they matter.  At least say hello to us... and asking clients if they want a drink would be helpful too."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere with the birds and all the greenery.  Glad we found this place, food is great!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to come check this place out since I had recently moved to Chandler. The service though was awful. My boyfriend's meal was made incorrectly. Then the server didn't apologize but awkwardly took it back and it took 40 minutes for his tacos to be remade. I had finished my meal by then and had to check with the server about his meal because she never checked back in with us during the 40 minutes. It wasn't busy while we were there on a Tuesday afternoon so I can't imagine why it took so long. Overall the food was mediocre and overpriced."}
{"text":"Interesting place just off the main square in Chandler down an alley. You will find a bar of course and some giant bird cages housing rescued birds. They do have a large number of draft beers on tap, most starting at 5 bucks. I think I tried the amber which was fine, but watch out for those 10oz pours for a higher price. They had closed the upstairs due to it was \"wet\", but that is kind of this bar's main feature. So, if the upstairs is closed and you can't see the birds from the bar, what we end up with is just a normal bar. Will try again for the roof view, but that part should stay open through all business hours."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place out, as I heard it was a unique, locally owned spot. 

I took two of my friends to Perch for a Monday night dinner and drink fest. We arrived at 6 and were given our choice of inside outside, etc. We picked a table inside the lower portion of the place near the door (Protip to owners- for the love of God, put a spring on your front door so it automatically closes- it spent half the night open and all the AC escaping because people don't know how to close the door).

Things started off well, we were greeted by a super friendly guy with a huge beard. He explained everything and took our drinks and apps orders. 

The food was above average for a beer place. The huge problem is that our server (and all staff) disappeared. I felt like an Amber Alert might have been appropriate. It wasn't busy at all, and I saw several female servers hustling around outside, but for some reason the guys working the bar were also responsible for inside guests. At one point after waiting 15 minutes for help, I went up to the bar to order our dinner but our server was too busy restocking fruit and other side work and never saw me. I dejectedly walked back to our table. Eventually another guy came by to check on us, and I asked if we could order dinner and for some reason that seemed to piss him off. The guy seemed genuinely annoyed that we would dare to want to order dinner. 

One other random thing is that they charge .50 for a side of ranch dressing. I found that pretty tacky and low rent. Our tab was $84, do we really need to pay .50 for ranch? I get if you are ordering a ton- but for one side? Come on, that's cheap to nickle and dime your customers like that.  I spent over $100 for a simple bar dinner, throw in some ranch. 

So overall, Perch has tons of potential, but sadly when your servers flew the coop- and you're abandoned, it's hard to get excited about a place."}
{"text":"had a fantastic time here with another couple. they had been here another time and had vouched for the food/drinks.

loved the atmosphere and the great outdoor area that housed all sorts of birds and vegetation. it was really relaxed and comfy. staff was extremely friendly and even though our wait for a table was 35 minutes, we passed the time chatting at the bar and getting great service from the bartenders.

food was pretty good. check out the sweet potato tots (love them) and their burgers. the salads also looked pretty good and were served in large portions.

definitely going to come back here to try some other things and maybe hit it up during happy hour to see if service is still great and to try some of their specialty drinks.

really a great place in chandler and nice to see something new and exciting in the area!"}
{"text":"The Perch is a fantastic place to kill an afternoon. Between the super friendly bar/beertenders, to the AMAZING food, to the quirky birds, there's always something fresh and exciting to keep you entertained for hours. I had Rebecca's Caprese with fried green tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, balsamic drizzle, the whole 9. It was great. The real star of the show was the HANGOVER BURGER! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Put green Chile pork and a fried egg on anything and I'll eat it and ask for seconds. The brunch menu caught my eye too but it wasn't available while we were there. Breakfast pizza?? Breakfast calzone?? Stop. I'm swooning. To drink I had The Perch's own Belgian Peach - an 8% ABV fruit beer. Sneaky and delicious! It was savory enough to balance out the sweet peach notes. I had a great time at the Perch and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"So. Much. Fun. 

This might be my new go to bar. I had such a great time. It feels like I'm on vacation. There are so many cool birds and beautiful plants and giant board games and a rooftop bar. Basically everything I look for. The bar alone I give 5 stars. 

The food though (on happy hour at least) wasn't as fantastic as the atmosphere. It was just OK. And same with the service. It was fine. We got what we needed, but it took a little bit. Wish there were better happy hour deals, I would come way more frequently."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Really good service. Good music.Didn't try the food but it is a fun place to hang out for a few drinks. Definitely not your run of the mill bar."}
{"text":"Duck Reuben was to die for. Had an Oskar Blues IPA that went perfect with it. Seating was a little slow and they had forgot our reservation, but this food is worth every second of the wait. Come try this place!"}
{"text":"Good food and drinks! They just added a mimosa sampler that is really cool.

P.S. It would be a lot better if they were purées and not flavored alcohol;)"}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday for lunch. They tout themselves as a gastropub and brewery. The ambience and restaurant was lovely. Nice outdoor dining and decent upstairs patio and this place also doubles as a bird sanctuary. I do, however, think the sanctuary should be separate from the dining. Many of the birds seemed agitated with people running around and they were VERY noisy. As for the noshing, my beau had Perch's Rosemary and I had the Sundress. I preferred his Rosemary, neither was that bad. My friend got the Hurricane. It was thick and syrupy and gross. I got the open tamale, it was on the spicy side and fantastic, 9/10! My beau got some chicken sandwich with beer bread and tots. He hated it. The bread was too big compared to the minuscule piece of chicken which wasn't anything special. My friend's beau ate maybe half of his caesar with semi wilted lettuce and my friend ate most of her fish taco plate which looked delicious. Overall, the menu needs a bit of work. I definitely would not call this a gastropub. The service was good too. Corbin is adorable, our server that followed after he left was very disheveled. She looked like she maybe needed to shower(dirty nails/clothes, messy hair), she was super nice though. I would say this is a cool spot to grab a drink and small bite upstairs."}
{"text":"The Perch has come along way since it opened , a really long way. The service , the menu, food quality , the atmosphere , the beer selection on top of their own brews!  It's been consistently busier and busier- good for them, well earned. The bartenders are Really into their groove, well done. Enjoy the upstairs at night with a DJ"}
{"text":"Really like their food. Very cool atmosphere. They have rescued birds in cages and it is a cool piece to this place. This place is mostly outside so your enjoyment could be based on the weather on that current day. I cant really imagine eating outside in the summer time. Their own beer is nothing to rave about but they have a good selection of other beers."}
{"text":"Good drinks and fun place. There are different birds to see, a rooftop bar with music, a downstairs more casual bar, and a nice area to sit outside. I've never eaten inside so I don't know what that's like. Unfortunately, the food used to be much better. They used to serve a meat and cheese board which now is just a board with fruits and a few pieces of meat that I could've picked up from the deli myself. Burger is decent."}
{"text":"Service is great and the atmosphere can't be beat, but sadly the beer is warm and food, while priced well, is just okay. I'd try it again though, in case it was an off day."}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday, there was 6 of us, and we all ordered something different, I had the Green Chili Pork, it's in a bowl topped with cheese,it was ok nothing great about it, then my husband ordered the Fish and Chips, well for $16.00 and you get BBQ Potato Chips to me overpriced, could have gone to the Pirate Fish and Chips on the corner and saved a ton of money, then my daughter got the Brick oven Mac and cheese, it was in a big bowl but for $15.00 WOW!!! I was so blown away with all the high prices, I think if you were to go there it be good just to hang out and order a beer and try and find a cheap snack. We said outside that was about the only think I really liked. I don't think I will be going back anytime soon. To pricey"}
{"text":"Cool brunch spot in downtown Chandler area. When the weather is still nice and not scorching hot, the patio is the place to be. Came here for brunch on Sunday mid morning and got seated right away. Lots of options for brunch with some very creative items. I got the breakfast burger and it was gigantic and definitely cured the hangover. The combination of everything on it from beef, bacon and ham, egg and holindase sauce made it a delicious sloppy mess. The tots were cooked perfectly too which most place struggle to do. The breakfast burrito was alright, but very greasy and dripping with oil. Drink prices were a steal too for mimosas and bloody Mary's. The atmosphere is really cool with a bunch of exotic birds around and being enclosed with trees. Makes you feel like you are in a slice of a tropical island in Arizona."}
{"text":"We heard of this place through another local brewer and he was spot on. We tried a flight first of those they brew, all were good but the Mosaic and the Grilled Lemon cream ale stood out for us. Claudia was our server, and are we the lucky ones for that . She was engaging, funny , knowledgable of the beer. I tried the Spinach/ artichoke chilled cheese... Incredible... So the entire day ... A success...."}
{"text":"Very fun place.  I love the upstairs part.  Smoking allowed on the upper level."}
{"text":"You've gotta really really really love birds to enjoy this place, and in general I feel not great about them. I know, dumb of me to come anyways, but I promise that's not the only reason I think The Perch deserves 3 stars. However, it is important to note that it can get pretty loud on the patio (like, hard-to-hold-a-conversation loud) if the birds all get riled up. That being said, the patio is the best place to sit when it's not too hot out. 

We came here for brunch and were a little bummed that we couldn't get tots until 11. But we stuck around for a bit, so we were able to get the garlic, herb, and goat cheese tots later on. Pretty tasty, but it threw us for a bit of a loop that the goat cheese was liquid. I chose the chicken and toffles for my meal, which was okay. The fried chicken was just a few chicken strips, which weren't terrible or anything, just not at all what I was expecting and nothing to rave about. The beer sausage gravy didn't taste very beer-y, just kind of like a general gravy. I did enjoy the over easy egg on top, but that's pretty hard to screw up. The toffle itself was a cool concept but I think better in theory than execution. Overall, a bit underwhelming. 

The service was okay. Food came out pretty quickly despite the place being fairly full, and our waitress was perfectly nice, but couldn't answer a few of our questions. This normally wouldn't be a huge issue, but she struggled with a lot of the beer questions, which I was taken aback by considering it's a brewery.

I do like that this place has a separate gift shop with some pretty cool things. and particularly enjoyed that you can get a lot of merch with Luna on it."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer. Love the  rooftop bar. Neat to see birds on first occassion but sit upstairs to avoid some of the noise. Food is amazing. One of my local favorites.  Service has  been hit or miss hence the 4 stars."}
{"text":"Quirky, hip, cool restaurant just off the square in downtown Chandler. Solid selection of beers, and the fish tacos are awesome. Occasionally will have entertainer(s) playing. Very friendly staff - highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I am mixed about this place.  The manager was very nice but the service was not good, on a Thursday night there were only 2 servers and we had to constantly go seek out the server.  The food was good depending on what you had, the carnitas dip was very tasty, the pig wings also very yummy. The pretzel was not so good and the Caesar salad was not good either.  Almost every beer that 3 people at the table tried to order was out and thats pretty bad when you are saying you are a brewery.  The atmosphere is neat, with birds in cages around you.  There was a good Jazz group playing as well."}
{"text":"This is a cute place, I really like the atmosphere and the setup.
Being a big animal lover I love how there are macaws and parrots all around the grounds, you can hear them singing to each other and having a good time. The patio is quite nice, there's nice greenery and plant life to make an oasis out of the desert, the setup is attractive. I'm not into sports and bars so I avoid the rooftop bar section, I was happy chilling in the patio oasis.

The food is well done, nice portions, average prices. The sweet potato tots are pretty solid, and you get a TON, felt like 2 pounds of them.

Overall it's a good place to come relax and hang out, it's a nice small business with class and style, I'll return for sure."}
{"text":"Previous visit we had slow service but the atmosphere made up for it. Now attempting to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday we called at opening requesting a reservation for a party of 8. We were told we could not do same day reservations but that 5pm was open enough to accommodate our party. We get the family together from all over the town (siblings from flagstaff, mesa, and apache junction) and traveled all the way here. On arrival we were told that the entire bottom floor was reserved and they would not be able to seat us, nor did they even offer a wait time and shyed us away. They offered upstairs but one person in our party is 20 and they do not allow anyone under 21. This was a horrible and embarrassing experience and we had to stand around outside attempting to call other locations to accommodate us, settling for a chain location instead."}
{"text":"The place was terrible,  waitress didn't even clear the table, gave us a drink menu that required to handle with care, had a conversation with the manager as we were leaving and he didn't seem to even care, our group of friends will not likely to return. I can't even rate this place"}
{"text":"Came here for the ambience, left because of the staff's attitude.  My friends live in the area and really wanted me to visit this place. The concept is great, the patio is awesome, didn't get to go up to the roof as it was closed during the daytime? Stopped in for 1 drink and left. Checked out the over-priced menu items; tater tots with garlic, herb goat cheese $8.00. A \"Sonoran Dog\" bacon wrapped hot dog on a pretzel bun $10.00 are ya kidding me? You want chili? That's extra. How about a \"House Burger\" for $12.00 The menu was made by \"hipsters\" for \"hipsters\". Jalapeno marmalade? Why? What's wrong with sliced jalapenos? This is what I'm talking about.I saw the tacos and the shells they use are like straight up taco bell. Save your money unless you are a twentysomething living at home and blow your money on drinks and food as paying rent is never a concern. I'll just spend more money \"Living La Vida Loca!  Now you know the demographic group being targeted. So get in where you fit in. Right? There were plenty of staff there and not very friendly, dragging ass and dropping beer, dropping taco trays, just hurting probably from the excess of the previous night and not wanting to be on the opening shift no doubt. Maybe the vibe here at night is different. Maybe being drunk makes you grade softer and be more accepting of it all. I don't know. I kept telling myself, I gots to go! Management- tune up your menu and include non-hip menu items to be inclusive. Bird Lovers come in all shapes and sizes- ONE SIZE does not fit all. I'll give this place another shot again-maybe at night. But to sum it up now- This place is truly for the Birds!"}
{"text":"I am writing only because I do like the atmposphere and any patio in AZ is beautiful.  The problem with the patio setting and being at a brewery, is the want to drink!  The beers are about $7.00 each so you can imagine the bill after a few drinks.  When drinking great beer, you naturally want great food.  The food was not worth the prices at all!  I got a chicken ceasar salad ($10) and the chicken was cubed and cold (yuk!) and the dressing was not ceasar, it was cilantrol something, and there was no parmesan shavings as described, and no croutons!  How is that a ceasar?!  Also, the burger as described was cooked medium-well and was described as being 80% chuck, 20% pork shoulder.  It tasted frozen, looked frozen, and might as well had been frozen because it was cold when I got it!  

My bill of 4 guests was over $100.00 I will not be going back!  It wasn't worth it after the overpriced atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome! Super cool atmosphere with lots of beer on tap.   Food is pretty good, but leaves room for improvement.   Can't wait to go back once they have their own beer on tap.   

Watch your fingers near the birds... Especially the red macaw... Seriously..."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Service was so slow. I would not recommend going there again if there are more then 2 people there. Seems like they dont know what they are doing. Must not do a lot of training. Bird cages were disgusting. I would think that they would clean them once in a while."}
{"text":"Service has been awful, they've been open for only a month but have lots to work on in terms of service.  Our server was complaining that they had to go up and down the stairs for some of our drinks (I was  debating whether or not to remind the employee that the establishment is named \"The Perch\" after all.

A bud light took 30 min to deliver from time of order. It was during happy hour so I believe the staff was ill prepared.  The menu was very limited, wings were not available yet even though it was on the menu.  Why would an establishment put it on a menu to begin with.

For a brewery, their stout list was limited to only one (e.g. Odell Chocolate Nitro).

I would pass on this place in the future.  Only attended b/c colleagues chose the place."}
{"text":"Best and most unique beer selection in Chandler. The food is awesome as well. Go in for happy hour."}
{"text":"Great place, enjoy the birds and the people. Did not try food yet next time. Friendly stuff, craft beers choice is good."}
{"text":"I was with my film crew, on set to shoot our last day of filming and we were hungry. Everyone else mention The Perch and I didn't have a clue about it, I'm not from Chandler. So I said why I'm always interested on new food. So I ordered the  Chicken Bacon Club with tots on the side. Delicious, Delicious when come back in town for another gig, I'll definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"The beer is amazing and the food is right there with the beer.  Apparently they just started making their own bread and it's fantastic!!!!  Not only do they have drafts of The Perch they have many other drafts of local brews."}
{"text":"Fianna is the best bartender,  super down to earth, friendly and just awesome.  She also makes a killer old fashioned.  I always make it a point to walk upstairs and say what's up."}
{"text":"The only reason this place is getting 2stars is for the beer SELECTION, not the prices. And as all the other Yelpers, we so wanted to love this place, but just can't. My husband doesn't like it when he knows I'm going to give a bad review because he feels bad for them, BUT the whole point is to help these people figure it out! During our visit, we decided pretty quickly that we probably would not be coming back, so hopefully these reviews are taken seriously & with consideration. I will give the atmosphere and decor a 4 star, it's cute and has a nice set up with a lot of potential. And here comes the big but again, BUT you can't serve overpriced crappy food with great beer. You can't have a team that doesn't know anything about your great beer selection & brings you the wrong samplers. You can't have them correcting you multiple times on how to pronounce a beer if they get it wrong!! You can't have them give you the wrong tables check at the end of service. You can't have them wipe down a wet table while your seated with another wet, disgusting bar towel & then make you wait while they search for a dry one to finish the job. You just can't do any of those things & expect repeat customers. The food was bad, really bad! And when you are talking about the great beer, why would we come here if we could go right down the street to a Brewery who also has great food & beer that isn't overpriced! Let me say, we don't have a problem paying high prices for great beers or great food or great service, but when you miss on all counts, it felt like a waste of money. Perch you need to sit down with the greeters, chefs and the servers and have a pow wow, ASAP! Sorry for this BUT I just couldn't accept not writing this review. :("}
{"text":"Denied service even though I presented my legal 21+ ID."}
{"text":"After hearing about this pub from a friend a few times - I had to check it out. The majority of Yelp reviewers pointed out that the Strawberry beer was great and the atmosphere was unique and cool. I agree. Most of the reviewers also stated the food could be improved - agreed. It wasn't bad - it just wasn't that great.

I give this pub 4 stars because it is a unique place and they do have decent custom beers. I recommend this place for happy hour."}
{"text":"I adore any place whose menu, venue and atmosphere take your dining experience outside of the box! Perch Pub does that and more, it's a sweet escape from the hustle and bustle of the city, a little corner paradise with beautiful rescued birds from the Amazon. Practically hidden, Perch Pub is tucked away in the downtown Chandler area just waitng to be discovered. Friendly staff, tall trees, twinkling lights and the chatter of curious birds greet you upon your arrival. It was a special occasion that brought us to the Perch, and early at that so we took the time to hold conversations with the birds while we sat on little tree stumps and enjoyed a game of painted stone checkers. Now to explore the menu and take your tastebuds on an adventure! It's always wonderful to dine with others who are willing to share. We started  with the garlic herb tator tots drizzled in goat cheese, mouthfuls of savory goodness and enough to feed a few people. Then on to the tasty fried green tomato sliders, no boring burgers here. I made a trade for a light side salad to add a healthy balance but not enough to keep my eyes from wandering while others delighted in green chili pork pizzas,a Duck Rueben sandwich, and wings. I'm looking forward to finding my way back to explore more of the menu, the upstairs deck and the bar(both of which are 21 & up) This is definitely a lovely out of the box  dining experience and so much more..."}
{"text":"I stop in probably once a quarter, it's a fun and laid back place for families and singles, etc. The colorful birds and yard games make it an interesting hang out and a lil fun for kds to pass time. The upstairs bar and sometimes dance floor have great mini views of downtown Chandler. Foods pretty good, prices decent but they could use nicer and less snobby hostesses. During busy season it's not my favorite, packed space and loud people get birds amped up and they get loud sometimes. Overall average and different."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable!  I was blown away that such a restaurant existed until recently. Not only are there exotic birds everywhere (I'm a huge animal lover) but the brunch is to die for. I've been to the brunch twice now and have always been seated right away. The berry and walnut pancakes are exceptional and the breakfast calzone takes your breath away it is that good. I would hands down recommend this place to anyone. I guess if I had to gripe about anything it would be about how long the food takes to come out but if I have to wait for food this good then I am willing and able. Plus you can go look at all the birds while you're waiting."}
{"text":"Update: better food today, but we still waited over any hour to get our food after ordering. The only reason I go to this place is because my daughter likes the birds.  I've been 3 times and the food is never good. Usually bland and overcooked. The one thing that confuses me is that I can't call ahead to get on a waitlist,  but I can do it online. The online way froze up on me,  so when I called to get on the list,  they said they wouldn't take call aheads. How does that even make sense? I can't help you,  but the computer can.  No wonder people are getting replaced by technology! Get your s%&# together Perch!"}
{"text":"Unique venue, lots of outdoor seating. The Brewery aspect is not much of a highlight...all the beers we tried were not very desirable. The Hefe tasted like used cigarette butts. Didn't try the food but it looked yummy passing by us."}
{"text":"This place was pretty awesome. They have all these exotic birds surrounding the outer dining area. It's definitely a different type of experience. Their tots are amazing! We got the jalapeño marmalade and omg! Best thing ever! We house got their house burger which was pretty good also. The only complaint is that my veggie burger was pretty burnt making it hard to bit into around the edges. Overall it still wins a five star because the customer service was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend The Perch, it's a gorgeous atmosphere and you're surrounded by rescued birds & delicious food! Love it here!"}
{"text":"This was a great little place. Nice ambience with Bird Cages and exotic birds all around in a tree shaded patio setting. . Nice selection of beers, Wine and Well Drinks.  Friendly Staff. The Menu looks really nice. .Had the Brussells w/ Pork Belly Sausage.. Very good, albeit a tad on the spicy side... Looking forward to coming back and visit again."}
{"text":"Great patio! The peach beer is to die for."}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend for dinner and was not pleased. We waited to be seated and then after about 8 minutes finally were seated. The hostess took our order for drinks and then got them. However once we were ready to order, no one came by to even ask if we had any questions or if we were ready. We waited around for like 15 minutes until finally someone walked by and I told them we needed our order to be taken. She seemed very bothered and kind of upset that I was asking for help. Server came by 5 minutes later. Food was good, a little pricey but was good. After we finished we ordered a dessert. It was very yummy! We then waited for another 10 minutes for a check and had to tell a busser to get our server. Bottom line, food is pretty good but the service is awful."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for dinner and wine. Our server was super cute with short bleach blonde hair. She was so sweet and helpful. The environment was amazing. The heaters made it pleasant to be on the patio and the lights were beautiful. We both got the tamale which was not your traditional kind but it was absolutely amazing. The service was perfect, food was fabulous, wine was delicious, and we are definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great service each time we come and wonderful food. The carnitas dip is my fave!  It's an entertaining place for kids, too. Our daughter loves looking at the birds. And the waiters/waitresses have always been really accommodating."}
{"text":"This is not only the friendliest brewery I've been to but I like their beers the most and if I'm not into what they have to offer they have an awesome selection from other breweries. It's like a more feminine version of Casey Moore's Oyster bar but with a brewery aspect. If you don't know which beer to try they bring you samples and it's great! Hands down my favorite place in the east valley to drink and eat. They always have good music playing and it's not overcrowded on a Saturday night. Just gonna say the waitresses and waiters do a fantastic job in customer service and work really hard! Btw the food is great and they do breakfast yay!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection and tasty unique food.  It's still new, so the service is a little slow...well worth the wait.  Try the green chili pork pie."}
{"text":"Great place to go during the \"cooler\" season in Arizona. Its a comfortable setting with a large selection of beers and delicious foods. Birds is a nice novelty, but not when they are screaming at people walking by."}
{"text":"If Alfred Hitchcocks movie The Birds,  scares you stay away!
Downtown Chandler
Roof top bar with live music. Food was good drinks acceptable a relaxed place to hang out. Lower level dining area out door is for the birds literally,  who reside  in cages in the outdoor patio.
 again a fun place good pricing and Fun. Definitely different and that's always interesting."}
{"text":"Our friends love this place for the ambiance, music, selection. We loved it too. That's why after meeting our friends here for a Sunday brunch, a Birthday party we decided to book the upstairs patio for a group of 20 when our Moms were in town from Chicago and Oregon to make it a family event. We loved it until 4 of us all got sick 24 hours later. Brutally sick for 2 days(Awful).  

What we had in common is we all ate the chicken artichoke pizza at the Perch. None of us live together, nor did we spend anytime together earlier that day or weekend. The restaurant denied this of course after ignoring 2 emails and a letter delivered directly to the owner for a few weeks. The General Manager finally responded with a carefully crafted email 3 weeks later, definitely edited and inspired by their legal team denying any of my claims to the poisoning coming from their restaurant.  I was not going to escalate it further, however when the response was so void of customer service sympathy or an attempt to make it right I filed a claim with the Maricopa County Department of Public Health. Another one from our party did so also.

The investigation is pending. Anyone may report food poisoning via this site: http://www.maricopa.gov/EnvSvc/Complaints/Forms/ComplaintForm.aspx

Great place for drinks but think twice about eating there, no matter how cute and eclectic it is.  I wouldn't wish that sickness on my worst enemy. Good luck Perch."}
{"text":"It's all about the Beer and the Pig Wings! If you don't understand go and order it, you'll never want a chicken wing again!"}
{"text":"This used to be a great establishment, unfortunately the new ownership is Horrible. We used to go to Yoli's next door for breakfast and then come over and get drinks and listen to the birds. However the New ownership basically told us they don't want our business, when they decided to put up a fence between the 2 establishments trying to keep customers out. When I went over to ask about it they basically told me they didn't care if I came back and got drink anymore. Well if you don't want my business and your attitude is that you should have all my business or none of it, then I will choose to give you none of it."}
{"text":"FIRST TIME VISITOR FAIL: Because of my work schedule, Fridays and Saturdays are precious. Its rare that we have a chance to get out, and we used our one shot to check out the much touted Perch. We arrived at 5:20 (still 40 minutes of happy hour left.), and to our chagrin, they told us it would be at least 20 minutes until they could seat us. They said it was because they were full, but there were multiple tables open. We stood off to the side for several minutes to see if they would find us a table. The hostess finally came over to us and said we could sit at an empty table, but we would not get served because they only had 2 servers on staff and they were too busy. She further stated that another server would not arrive until 6 pm. When Joan asked if she could just get us a beer, the hostess stated that because she was punched as a hostess, she couldn't serve us. Well, don't worry, Perch. You successfully turned us away, and convinced us not to come back. It may be a very unique place, but your poor service towards a first time customer has made us a last time customer, or should I say, a NEVER customer."}
{"text":"The Perch is one of the top three places to go in downtown Chandler. The atmosphere is chill and fun, the beers are delicious (the Belgian Peach is my fave) and the food is super good as well. I have had the garlic, herb, and goat cheese tots and the margherita pizza. I will go there again and again."}
{"text":"I'd go here for just the experience, there's a bunch of exotic rescue birds that are there to view. I went for happy hour, the beer prices were decent but the variety was a bit limited (only 10 beers available to order). Food was my group tried everything, literally we accidentally ordered three different varieties of tater tots. The green pork chili and the mac & cheese was by far the best quality. The pretzels were a little bit too salty for my taste and overall I wasn't too impressed with the tater tots, the pita and hummus were ok but I wouldn't order it again. If you REALLY are craving tater tots the pesto were our favorite."}
{"text":"Horrible service! I have been here three times with an open mind every time and they never fail to let you down... If you think that your beer shouldn't beer empty for more than 10 minutes than this place isn't for you. Seriously. I try to think of a time when i have had worse device and I can't. I even nicely told our waiter, that i assume he is busy, just keep the beer coming please. He wasn't busy at all and still kept us waiting. Sad, sad, service for a place with great potential."}
{"text":"The wings and beer were phenomenal but when I went the birds were so loud I couldn't even hear the people at my table. This can really ruin the ambiance. Overall, great food and cool concept but try to go when the birds are not so loud. I would give the food 4 stars but the ambience was a little killed by the noise."}
{"text":"I love this place! From the unique setting to screaming birds the vibe is super relaxed and chill with a variety of beers! I tried the white and red sangria which was a little pricey for the quality but those little pretzel bites for an appetizer are awesome. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!! Tatertots were good but \"wetter\" than I expected. Nachos are super tasty! Grapefruit Raddler is very refreshing!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with my son last Friday, nice selection of beers as well as good food. We ate outside on the patio, since the weather was perfect!
Good service, happy hour prices are good."}
{"text":"Not exactly sure who made the decision to change the menu, but it certainly wasn't a good one. The waitress tried to explain that it was due to a kitchen remodel. So let me make sure I understand. You remodel your kitchen and now all you can serve is about 8 items consisting of basic wraps and salads?  Really?  No appetizers. Nothing from the original menu that kept us coming back. Just nothing.  What, exactly, did you remodel in the kitchen that hamstrung your menu to such a rudimentary offering?  You've literally reduced yourself to a glorified grocery store deli. 

Oh, and each culinary adventure costs $12 unless you want tots. Then it is $14. 

Sorry, Perch. You fell from grace so quickly it was startling. Maybe you will come to your senses soon and go back to what made you awesome."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and the food is on point. One of the only places you can comfortably sit outside all year round, as long as you don't mind listening to the birds. 

They have a great selection of beer, about half of which they brew themselves. For a small local brewery their beer is actually pretty good. 

Great brunch spot as well, can't beat the mimosa flights."}
{"text":"Great place! When pulling up down the alley I was like ummm what is this place. Well got out and walked by the birds! Loved the beautiful birds. We sat on the patio and had quick service. Ordered some beers which they brew themselves. Bomb! Then we got some tater tots and the green Chile pie! Everything was great! The atmosphere gave me a Hawaii/ flagstaff vibe. Very kick back! Love this place and will def be returning!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience. The atmosphere was both inviting and laid back, and the playlist in the balcony area was right up our alley. It was a Sublime meets Pepper meets Slighty Stoopid mix of perfection.

Our server, Robbie (I think...), was friendly, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic about the food. He listened to my likes/dislikes when it comes to beer, suggested some of his favorites, and allowed my to sample a few before ordering. I choose the Perch GLCA (grilled lemon cream ale), it was uniquely delicious. For \"linner\" we had the Garlic Herb and Goat Cheese Tots (yum), the Fish Tacos (delightful), and the Pork Sliders (wonderful). 

After stuffing our bellies, we met the birds. The were beautiful, in good health, and well taken care of. It's obvious that they get a lot of attention from patrons and love from staff. I spoke with multiple employees about the birds and their personalities. One employee assisted me in holding a very friendly macaw, Opie. It was a great ending to an already great experience. 

Keep up the good work, Perch peeps."}
{"text":"It is always a treat to visit the perch. The perch is one of the few places in Arizona that brews their own beer and also has great food.  Perch is special and unique because it has a outdoor bird sanctuary. If your reading this you should go there and check it out. Call and put your name down for a reservation if you can because it can get very busy."}
{"text":"We used to love it here. The patio has a number of rescue birds, which concerns of cleanliness aside, are awesome entertainment for kids. The servers are generally friendly though this place gets busy and feels understaffed sometimes. The downsides: the food is just meh. With the kitchen remodel my favorite grilled cheese isn't on the regular menu anymore and worse yet, the prices have gone way up. The beer is generally average though this is the only place I've ever sent a beer back because it was just undrinkable (got an IPA that smelled and tasted like wet dog--if it had been wine i would have sworn it was corked).  Then there are the customers. There are always families in the dining area but inevitably I end up having to dodge some insanely drunk person who is dressed like they are out clubbing at 6PM, usually as they stumble down from the upstairs patio looking for the bathroom. Maybe for a quick happy hour with friends, The Perch is fine but we won't be regulars anymore."}
{"text":"Love the different atmosphere to choose .. at the court yard surrounding by green plants and parrots feel like you are in amazon forest, or sitting indoor to feel the sport bar vibe, or go to the rooftop bar with good live jazz music playing and you will feel like you are in somewhere in NYC rooftop bar!"}
{"text":"This was our first time in. Cassie have great service! My dad and his girl were in from Georgia and they couldn't have loved it more. The birds were super fun exploration while we waited for our table  (only about 10 mins or so). 
My dad have the juevos rancheros and his girlfriend had the Turkey club...they both LOVED. My roommate and I split the prime dip. We weren't super impressed with it, but it wasn't bad. For a $16.00 sandwich, I want my mouth to water longing for the next bite, ya know?
The drinks were all quite good. They both had bloody marys and were in love! I had the mimosa flight (5 rather large pours for the price). They were out of the watermelon, so cassie gave a recommendation of trying a kiwi (not listed on menu). By far my favorite!
I will definitely be back to try the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"The Perch is weird.  The Perch is bizarre.  The Perch makes almost no sense whatsoever.  But for the most part, I dig it.  Amid the valley's exploding microbrewery scene, The Perch can rightly claim to be truly different from them all.  Partly because of the architecture, partly because of the wildlife, partly because of their inventory.  Okay I've teased this enough so let's get to my early Saturday evening dinner story.

Just beyond the southern edge of Downtown Chandler, you will find a mismatched group of buildings on Wall Street (no not that Wall Street) just south of Chicago Street.  Just south of The Local, lies a steel caged archway filled with rocks that empties into a spacious outdoor patio.  The patio is filled with vegetation and decorations and also happens to house huge cages full of birds (hence \"The Perch\" I presume).  I counted a dozen different birds in all.  At first I thought the owner just had some weird desire to have his own bird zoo.  But as it turns out there's a benevolent tilt here.  Effectively they're acting as a rescue sanctuary for neglected and abused tropical birds.  Either way, you can't miss them if you're out on the patio.

In addition to the patio, there's a mishmash of sheds, wooden structures, and an upstairs patio bar overlooking Downtown Chandler (only open after 6pm for some reason).  The main structure houses the indoor/outdoor first floor bar, which has the look and feel of your typical neighborhood sports bar.  I plopped myself down at the bar for this first go around.  With the whole of The Perch being so wide open to the elements, I have no idea how they take care of their customers during summer or a rainstorm, but today was fine so I digress.

One thing that stands out about the The Perch from other microbreweries in town is the sheer volume of in house brews they sell.  Whereas most microbreweries I goto typically sell 6-8 in house choices at a time, The Perch had 18 different in house brews to choose from.  After consulting with the waiter on options, I went with their Bird Bath IPA as a smooth hoppy starter for the evening.  That was then followed by an app order of the Perch Pretzels.  Three fresh baked soft pretzel sticks slathered in butter and accompanied by beer cheese using their Oregon Street IPA.  The cheese had a nice kick but was super rich, to the point where I couldn't possibly eat all of it.  The pretzel sticks themselves were perfectly warm and pillowy soft starters.  For the main course, I went with their Brick Oven Tamale.  A big hunk of pulled pork mixed with green chilis, poblano hash, a mix of three cheeses, and topped off by a fried egg, guacamole, and pico de gallo.  This was absolutely not a tamale by any definition of the word, but that didn't take away from the fact this is a quality dish.  The cheeses and guacamole do a great job mellowing the punch of the green chilis, allowing you to enjoy the savoriness of the pulled pork and yolk from the egg rounds out it out with a slightly salty note.  Lastly for dessert, I opted for their Cookie Dough Rolls.  And what a finish this was.  Four chocolate chip cookies, fried and rolled up like taquitos, then stuffed with warm soft chocolate chip cookie dough.  Also came with vanilla ice cream and topped with chocolate and butterscotch syrups.  Where has this been all my life?  An absolutely divine guilty pleasure of a dessert that by itself would bring me back here.

Total cost for all the food, the beer, tax, and tip came to about $55.  I'll echo a little bit of criticism specifically about the prices as the main dishes can be expensive here, though I would say the Tamale was priced pretty nominally based on the complexity of the dish.  My main criticism would probably lie with my appetizer, which (while good) didn't merit the $10 price in my opinion.  Other than that, I felt the prices for the food (and the portions) I received was fair.  In any event, a pretty unique find (particularly for the suburbs) and a place that will appeal to bird lovers, sports fans, beer lovers, and people looking for an interesting outside the box beer infused menu.  Why that upper deck bar isn't open during the day I'll never understand, but that might be The Perch's only major shortfall.  Otherwise, fly on over here (see what I did there) and check out perhaps the valley's most unique microbrewery experience."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised when we arrived lots of birds in their cages ( thus the name  the perch ) brunch was amazing and to top it off staff was extremely knowledgeable about not only the beer on tap but their recommendations for food choice were spot on. If you like sports they have big screen tv's with different games showing, long story short great beer ( Sonoran white chocolate ) even better food and staff is top notch !"}
{"text":"Perfect weather.  Little shady patio with 100s of bird chirping  the smell of pinot noir lingers onthegentle breeze while my Beautiful tattooed Asian waitress bring me beer battered fish tacos at The Perch....ole!"}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast, drinks with friends, and dinner with parents. Every time the service is exceptional, the atmosphere is unique and fun, the food is above expectations. Definitely a pillar of the new downtown experience!"}
{"text":"I went to the perch for the first time with a friend last week. Their happy hour food is fantastic and their peach beer is amazing. I went back a few days later with my husband and the birds were very overwhelming. In fact by the time we left there he was having a major asthma attack. Unfortunately the great tasting beer and happy hour food specials aren't enough to bring me back because of the bird issues. I recommend anybody that has asthma or breathing problems do not go here."}
{"text":"We are not drinkers. We came here to see the birds with toddlers. They loved it! In addition all the food we had was excellent! The turkey sandwich and the prime rib dip were particular favorites. The ambiance was great but there were a lot of bees."}
{"text":"This place is different.. Food was good .Mostly outside seating , birds are every  where..Its hidden not on main street. Service was awesome drinks were good."}
{"text":"I was there twice.  One the week of the opening then again last weekend.  It was packed - it was crazy!   The place is fun and fabulous!!!!    A person at every seat upstairs and down.  We were waited-on, and checked-up by staff and management, they were very concerned for our wait time, and we appreciated it.  We were not in a hurry.  It's a fun, unique , place with a young vibe.  Keep up the good work.  I'm coming back, with friends and family."}
{"text":"Don't pay attention to those that give lower ratings--not related to what's important!! It's the food and drink that counts--and both are terrific here. Add in how great the patio is in non-summer months and you have a bingo!!!  Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Too bad the service is terrible because the food is great and the atmosphere is fabulous. Staff is doing the owners a great disservice. But then again the owners are the ones tolerating the low performance. Hope you guys get it together. Chandler needs unique places like the Perch."}
{"text":"The menu is not very desirable and the service is usually pretty off. I love the funky concept with the rescue birds. I wish they would implement consistent training for servers. It's just basic stuff. I ask for a water refill, he brings it and does not fill my friend's empty glass. He asks if one person would like another beverage, leaves to get it without asking others if they also would like another.. One night we had such a chatty server that my friend said 'I see my beer at the bar and it's getting warm. Would you mind bringing it'?"}
{"text":"Great place, they were overcrowded and short staffed (due to waiters calling in sick) yet did everything they could to make us happy. I highly recommend. The beer tub lady was super friendly too"}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere and is pretty big. I haven't been here in the summer though since I'm not sure how comfortable it would be since it's all an outdoor venue. There is a covered area where the downstairs bar is but it's still open air. They have an upstairs 21 and over area with couches and another bar too.

About 10 of us went and we were able to sit together in the lower level outdoor space. There was a super loud floor fan next to us, which we turned off. However, we realized the fan was keeping all the flies away. So it was either not hear each other or have flies.

Our server was nice but not very good. It took about 20 minutes each time we ordered a drink  for it to make it to our table. The time from when I asked for the check and we actually signed the receipt was 45 minutes. The restaurant was not packed either.

I did enjoy the tater tots! They have plain or several flavors to choose from. The rest of the food was just ok though. My husband didn't think his fish and chips were anything but average.

This is a neat venue to go have a drink, but next time I will probably sit at the bar to see if the service is better."}
{"text":"ITs our first visit.. and its 109 today in Chandler..  damn hot and this place has a tough time keeping up INSIDE cool (i almost died trying to get thru my lunch)!! , but outside..., I can tell you that I have 4 Birds, (cockatoo Quaker conures) and the temperatures were way too HOT HOT HOT for them to be outside with there mediocre misting system.. you guys do an amazing job,  the food is great! the beer is great !, just PLEASE upgrade your AC system INSIDE and the misting systems OUTSIDE for those Birds... I saw a African Grey and to 2 cockatoos that were extremely overheated today . . Made us upset leaving"}
{"text":"Awesome place for date night!  Upstairs patio is the best.  The service is fantastic and same with the menu!  If you like birds, you will see a bunch here.  They have a talking bird and many other exotics.  Great place!"}
{"text":"The worst service I've had in a long time. Paid $15 for a burger that was supposed to be medium and was so well done, I thought I was eating charcoal. Food was cold and taste like it was sitting under a heat lamp for 20 min- server never returned to check on our food? One and done- I'll spend my money elsewhere!!! Many places to chose from in the area; out of here!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to go and get a flight of beer, and taste some good eats - standard pub + good healthy/tasty choices. Great atmosphere with noisy birds, and a roof deck for adults in the PM gives a quaint elevated look of downtown chandler."}
{"text":"Very interesting place. If you like birds you will love this restaurant. If you have kids they will love this place. Food is decent. Some unusual combos like their bird good which is made up of bacon brittle and poured over popcorn. Salty sweet combo but different. Love the tater tot plates with cheese on top. Yummy. You must walk around and check out all the birds it's a learning experience. They also have a nice section of local craft beers."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and brought friends and family here and they all agree. Not so impressed with the food but still have to give 4 stars if you want to hangout and have some drinks and enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in downtown Chandler! I love the atmosphere, the menu, and the mimosas on Sunday for Brunch."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy the outdoors in a natural setting with the sounds of the birdworld. Food and service is very good. The beer selections are more than adequate."}
{"text":"First time here & I loved it.  We tried a few different beers & were offered samples.  Their selection is good.  We sat at the bar & both bartenders were super friendly.  I had the pork & green chili sammy with a fried egg & it was delicious!  I may never order anything else.  Ambience is nice, this place is good for day times, nights & all types of people."}
{"text":"I have been here so many time after work because they close pretty late. So My co workers and I cans come to have some dinner and drink together. I definitely love their oyster shooter and chicken wings with jalapeños sauce. Their grilled cheese artichoke and spinach is the bomb!!!
And Strawberry beer is so good 

The service is fantastic as always I love their staff
I definitely come back more often."}
{"text":"We were a party of 7. They were very accommodating. As busy as they were, we were seated in 15 minutes. We enjoyed the best bloody Mary's I have had in a long time. We had the sweetest server. Her name was Sophia. Very attentive to all of us. Can't wait to go back again. Food was great, also."}
{"text":"It's a bar, brewery and parrot refuge and the place is gorgeous with an outside bar an upstairs area with a view. They have domestic and imported beers and they're own selections brewed onsight.

Delicious food too we got the green chili carne asada dip it has a huge chunk of carne asada in it! 

Also ordered the salmon salad and the brick oven tamale the tamale was off the hook!

It's parrot paradise!"}
{"text":"We had TERRIBLE service here!  I had to wait an hour for 2 appetizers to come out only after I asked the waitress where they were.  The chips were stale!  I asked for a grapefruit shandy and it wasn't filled up.  It was 2 inches from the top.  I'm not impressed and won't com back.  We asked for fish tacos and got fish and chips.  The service was crap!"}
{"text":"As always I checked the Yelp reviews prior to driving across town to visit this interesting take on a restaurant.  The reviews weren't stellar, just a mere 3.5 out of 5 so I threw caution to the wind and decided to make the trek with my Mom and one of her friends.  Parking is a bit atrocious, most spots are labeled with a one hour max, I'm thinking because there are a lot of businesses downtown and they all pay for parking.  

Don't get me wrong, I love the sound of birdies singing and carrying on but it seems a bit odd to sit and wonder whether we will have any 'poopings' occur.  The menu looked to be rather amazing, lots of local representation from beers to ingredients.  I chose the Pork Green Chile Pizza...it sounded like a good palate pleaser with Cotija cheese, seared green chiles, braised pork shoulder and a wood fired crust.  Yah, no :( When it arrived it looked like a giant white poop of mozzarella with a smattering of shredded pork and green chiles peeping out from under their white blanket.  My Mom's beautiful citrus and shrimp salad was yummy, it had 8 huge shrimp laced through the crisp layers of salad.  

We heard that Brunch is super busy so maybe the food offerings are a bit different.  I would never order that pizza again.  Also, take note that there are birds everywhere..in cages, flying around, singing, chirping.  There was a huge Macau that two women started irritating and it screeched and screeched, not what I want to hear while I'm eating.  

Anywho...I may try this place again if I happen to be driving by and don't have other options available."}
{"text":"We waited for over an hour. The hostess told us several times we were next, but many groups walked in the door and were seated while we waited. After an hour the hostess told us it would be at least another 20 minutes. We left and walked down the street to the Irish place and had an amazing time!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool, but without the rescued birds, I don't know that it would necessarily be so popular. The food is subpar, the dessert is fantastic and the service is okay. Our waitress offered us cheesecake leftover from five days ago, when we asked what desserts the had. We (obviously) said no thanks and opted for the brownie instead. You could spend a lot of time here watching the birds and enjoying the weather, but the restaurant itself is almost an afterthought. It's wonderful that the birds are from a rescue and not being exploited for profit here."}
{"text":"I was not expecting to like this place after reading some reviews but I was pleasantly surprised. We arrived at 4:30 Saturday afternoon. It was a hot day but sitting outside with all the trees made it quite pleasant. It took awhile to get used to all the birds squawking. We found our waitress to be very attentive. We had the bruschetta which was delicious and also the hummus trio which was also very good. Unfortunately they do not offer happy hour on weekends which many places do, so drinks were expensive. Our martinis ranged from $6.50 - $9.00. Overall it was a good experience with fast service and quality food."}
{"text":"Whoa - a sign of the apocalypse or could it be Chandler is inching towards hip? Yes the soft opening had some rough edges, but that seems to have been the plan. Come in and watch it evolve over time.....this is not a chain, it's unique, it's personable, and buckle my chin strap - it's in Chandler! The return visit last Sunday really made an impression - the service was quite good. Several came across as very knowledgable, friendly, and thoughtful, and it was busy. For me the outdoor space is it - lots of little nooks & crannies to relax in surrounded by trees/plants/birds, bees, & butterflies. Looking forward to a taste of the Perch's beer when it comes available. Roll on James!"}
{"text":"Great food. Nice patio. Very, very, very slow service for brunch. It took over an hour for the last person in our group to get food. Food wasn't delivered at the same time. The last person got her food after half the table finished eating. Even when the manager was notified, nothing was done or said to try and fix the situation. If they can't handle large groups, they should not make reservations for large groups."}
{"text":"Very unique restaurant with great ambience! From rescue macaws and exotic birds to rooftop bar with a gorgeous sunset view. This is one of my favorite Chandler restaurants. The service is great and I love the special brunch menu of huevos percheros and perch avocado toast!"}
{"text":"Great rooftop bar to hang out with friends and enjoy the AZ weather.  Excellent choice of beers and cocktails."}
{"text":"Always a hit for Sunday brunch. I like to go upstairs and sit at the bar. Friendly staff, good drinks, good food. Love the patio! Very unique and different.
I have been here for lunch, downstairs, service was definitely sluggish.
Sit upstairs, order some drinks, relax and soak up the sun. 
Wish it was closer to my house, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets two stars is because our waitress last time was so nice.
 We went on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't too busy. We sat upstairs and ordered beer off the menu. The waitress came back and told us they were out. This happened 3 times!  I felt bad for her having to go up and down the stairs just to tell us everything we wanted was out. We ordered food which was ok, but it did not make up for our experience with the beer.
This was my third time there and I wasn't impressed the first two times. The furniture looks like cheap crap from Ikea and they can't seem to get their act together. 
It is doubtful I will return."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Had to check it out because I love birds! Especially the exotics & the rescues like this. Figured it would be a fun environment to enjoy my birthday evening. The food was REALLY good! Can't say I was too impressed with the cocktail I ordered... a really weak gin & tonic with flat tonic & little gin. But, my Mom said the beer she ordered \"Bird Lite\" was great & had a perfect taste, not too strong but good flavor. And really, the food was GOOD! Loved the environment, effort & establishment- will definitely be back! However, I had to knock one star off & comment specifically on the hostess- not sure if this is the norm, but we were a bit aggravated the hostess waived her finger & told us to seat ourselves, barely giving direction, and we were clueless as to where to go... yes, we wanted to sit rooftop patio outside, but waiving your finger towards stairs hidden around two corners was not exactly helpful, nor was it ever explained the rooftop is specifically a BAR area, having a different, very small menu. We finally had to ask after finding our own seat, in the dark, because at 65 degrees after dark in December, we were also a bit COLD sitting on the roof, outside, with NONE of the heat elements surrounding the entire area turned on for ambiance or warmth! Why is that??? We could barely see anything & it was pretty chilly- it wasn't until after our drinks arrived & we asked about the really small menu of downstairs is different- and were finally explained to that the rooftop is strictly a bar atmosphere with 1/4 of the actual menu. No, we didn't want to have to be \"transferred\" after getting our drinks. 

So, overall, the atmosphere is awesome & this is a fun place with GREAT food! However- the ambiance of the bar area could use improvement with turning the heat lamps on during the cool, winter evenings after dark. And please explain to the hostess it would be more than helpful to HOST patrons to the area they are trying to find instead of waiving a hand/pointing a finger... it almost felt like we were a bother or interrupting. As well as distinguishing the rooftop is a bar area specifically serving only the bar menu. We really had no idea there was a difference between the upper & lower areas aside from one being strictly outdoors on the roof. Aside from the confusion, the lady waiting on our table was great, helpful & attentive, we really enjoyed the food & I loved the birds! Props on the big, spacious cages with lots of toys & excellent cleanliness (because bird owners KNOW just HOW difficult it is to keep bird areas cleanly!) it was a pleasure to visit with the rescues on the visit!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere, there's nothing like it. The beer and food are really good too!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The beer soaker uppers (pretzels) are the best I have ever had and the cheese keeps up with the quality as well.  I love the feel of this place and had really good service too. See Randal at the upstairs bar, did not even have to ask for a box for my food as he had already brought me one when I went to ask. 

   I had the chili dog to eat and holy chit is this thing off the chart.  Somewhere underneath a gargantuan pile of chili and cheesy awesomeness is a frigging delicious dog.  Finished off with a pretzel bun and this is hands down one of the best I have had.   I plan on coming here too try many more things off this menu.  

Also Be sure to check out the rooftop bar, the selection of draft beers is limited but the view and feel make up for it.  

Glad to live so close to this place will be back!

Don't listen to previous negative reviews it's hard starting off a new restaurant but this place has settled in nicely and is top notch for sure."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the ambiance of sitting outside under the greenery and listening to the birds. 

Service was really good and efficient.

Loved the pretzel pieces with beer cheese appetizer and such a good deal on the happy hour menu.  

My long island iced teas were not on the happy hour menu so quite pricey.

I also tried the fried green tomato sandwiches.  I thought they were to dry and to much bread to tomato ration with the pretzel buns.  I would not recommend them.

I am going back for the setting and happy hour appetizers!"}
{"text":"I went to the Perch yesterday instead of my usual go to microbrewery and boy was I glad. The bartender was friendly and helpful and delivered my beer with a smile. The beer was delicious and the wings tasty. The outdoor oasis is inviting and there are plenty of TV's in the bar area. I will be back soon and I highly recommend this establishment to others."}
{"text":"Real talk.  What happened here?  Every time I've been here has been amazing.  When my girlfriend lived in Chandler this was a haunt for us.

So we ordered drinks upstairs, there was only one waitress and one bartender.  There wasn't a crazy amount of folks so she had the ability to be super attentive but seemed to go into the corner and chill on her phone.

I can understand that sometimes it can take the bar keep a little bit to push drinks if you're by yourself and everyone is asking for a cocktail, but my girlfriend's beer didn't need to take 20 minutes to come out.  It was the Perch Raspberry, way too sour for me.

When the nachos came out there were cold and the waitress never came and asked how they were and the way things were going I wish the ladies had ordered when they had come so that it would move faster.  We got a the Perch burger and although it tasted decent it was cold which tells me I have no clue what it should taste like.  

PLEASE FIX!

Also, I noticed from the Bird Scoop that Anthony is no longer with us, he was my favorite.  That sucks."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere the birds are really cool. The beer is great and the pigs wings are the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"What a refreshing new place!  I loved the rooftop terrace and drank beer out in the sun with my family.  I tried a few beers (a strawberry one and a peach variety) that were delicious.  Goat's cheese dip is excellent and the Rebecca's topless black bean burger too.  Our waitress was a sweet girl who was sensitive in getting our orders out quickly.  This is a great place to pass a Saturday or Sunday afternoon.  Very relaxing, and thank you for opening a pub that's got great ambiance!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I really like the concept for The Perch but the execution is lacking. 
The environment was very unique and had a lovely outdoor patio space with a tropical feel. The Perch has hundreds of rescue birds in cages throughout the property. I think every wild bird with in a 25 mile radius was at The Perch enjoying a free lunch. With that being said, there are bird droppings all over the property including on the tables, chairs and even menus. I was also concerned about being pooped on just being there. 
The service was not great. The 2 hostesses looked to be teenagers and they were inappropriately complaining about other staff members not doing their job. 
Our server was okay when he finally made it over to the table. My appetizer went to the table next to us in error so we finally got it during our meal. Some of the servers were wearing Perch t-shirts and others were wearing street clothes which was odd. I also don't want my servers butt cheeks hanging out of her shorts. Just lacked professional appearance. 
The food was not good enough to bring me back to this place. 
If your looking to get drinks this would probably be an okay place but I would skip the expensive food. 
Your paying for the unique atmosphere here."}
{"text":"Best nest in Chandler. This is the unexpected. You must experience this place. It has to be one of my favorite locations in the valley. Best way to describe it is a secret garden turned bird sanctuary that serves great beer and interesting food dishes."}
{"text":"Very unique brewery/pub. Rescue birds are found throughout.  Cute quirky restrooms and game patio and to the charm. The rooftop bar is a great place to hang out. The beer selection is very good. They have their own brews, which are ok, as well as a good selection of top guest craft beers."}
{"text":"Great ambiance but pretty heavy entree... I would like more salad options. Fun for a night out on the rooftop."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio and great atmosphere. Grand birds in their homes surrounding you.

Good beer, brewed on site.

Food was OK, over-priced for the quality/taste.

Service was pretty bad. We had waited for a little over 30 minutes (which was expected), but when we were seated we were awkwardly placed in between two large birthday groups. Server was helping these two large groups and we seemed to be a bit of an afterthought. Long delay for drinks to arrive, food came but no silverware. Long wait for the bill - had to ask for it after waiting and waiting."}
{"text":"Really close to2.5 stars. Me and my boyfriend came here for a date night, neither one of us had been here before, and as we both are in the food and beverage industry we tend to be picky when it comes to quality of food and service, and I have to say, the food was amazing, our drinks were perfect and the atmosphere was super chill. However, the service was AWFUL. We sat at a table and waited about 5-6 min and not a single server greeted us, usually in this type of situation we would just leave but we wanted to try the food so we went and sat at the bar, which sucked because we were trying to enjoy a nice date night at a table to ourselves but oh well. The bartender was very monotone, you could tell he didn't really care about his customers and defiantly didn't put fourth any type of effort, probably won't be here again because of the terrible service."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good, the birds are what I fell in love with. It was like sitting at a resort in a tropical paradise. I had a blast."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere and great menu! We ate at the restaurant and the salads were large and tasty. After we went upstairs for cocktails and enjoyed the rooftop! Loved the birds too!"}
{"text":"We came here quite late, so we could not order from the full menu, only the late night one.as such, we were a bit worried, as those late night deals can be dry, bleh, w/e.

Pleasantly surprised!We got the Jalapeno marmalade wings, with the blue cheese sauce[ooooooozing real blue cheese, omg so yum!], and the chimichurri margarita pizza.Both were -excellent-!

Beer wise, I got their morning sex[ a stout with coffee undertones-omg so delicious ,I cannot even], the bf got Perch Coco The Nut With Dark Sky [ stout with creamy undertones].

All around, the birdies chirped and chattered.We LOVED it here, and cant wait to come back!
The waitress[ the one that told us about Luna and Carlito- you know who you are XD], was lovely and kind and perfect."}
{"text":"This is always a fun place to go for appetizers and drinks. When they first opened the service was spotty but I think it was due to misjudging how busy they would be. Now that they've been in business for awhile, I think they've come along way."}
{"text":"As much as I'm all about new local places sprouting up, I have to say this place is just average and would only really consider it as a beer spot.  I've been back a few times since they've opened over the course of several months, and have been disappointed in the food and mediocre service.  Also the fact that they failed their health inspection back in June really doesn't help persuade me to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is a favorite Sunday afternoon spot for me and my husband.  When the weather is nice, it is a real treat to sit outside among the cages of rescued birds.  I am not much of a beer drinker, but I do love their Rosemary IPA, and my husband, who is an avid beer drinker, always finds something he likes on their beer list.  The menu is reminiscent of pub grub with the smothered tots being a fun indulgence, and the fish tacos being my personal favorite.  We have not been to this place for Happy Hour, but we definitely enjoy it for a late Sunday lunch and have always found the service to be commendable and the atmosphere enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great selections of beers from them and other breweries as well. Love the setup and sitting on the patio. The food is pretty good too. They should start bottling or canning their beers."}
{"text":"Always a great vibe.  Pick your spot...rooftop bar, indoor intimate on space, or outdoor amongst the birds and nature.  Perch has it all.  Food menu is great.  Beer menu always leaves me disappointed and is my only complaint."}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning...Small Business Saturday...only my fourth time here....  Was the only one in the bar since it was so early....was great!  I was able to chat about beers and breweries with the Bartender, Tyler.  Friendly & chatty chap!!  Gave me a couple of samples of beers...so I could better decide what I wanted a pint of.  I opted for the Cinnamon Honey Nut Porter!  Great beer, fantastiv staff...will definitely be back!!  Thanks for everything The Perch!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Do not come here! It takes forever, you don't get your alcohol or your food. Looking at the reviews it seems others feel the same way. This bar will go out of service before long."}
{"text":"So-so food that does not warrant the terrible service. We were seated outside for brunch around 12:30. The server took drink orders, then left us to review the menus. She came back (without the drinks) and we were still deciding. It took ages for her to return again with drinks and take our orders. My friend then ordered a beer, which did not arrive until well after our food was delivered, which was quite a while. Three of the four brunch items were delivered to the table, along with the side of sausage I ordered. I asked about my entrée, and the runner delivering the food assured me it would be out in \"just a minute.\" Approximately 15-20 minutes later, the server finally delivered my brunch and curtly said she had taken it off the bill - no apology, no explanation. I had their version of huevos rancheros, which was a little different. The tortillas were crispy - at first, I thought they brought the breakfast tacos instead, but at that point, I did not care. The side of sausage was tasty but strange presentation - slices of a large sausage, instead of rounds or links that you normally get with breakfast. 

I heard the table next to us ask if there was a server assigned to their table because they had been sitting there a while and no one had checked in with them. We had another long wait for the bill at the end. On the whole, a cute space with lots of outdoor seating, but the food was not worth the poor service. Plus, as people have noted, there are exotic birds in cages throughout the place. I don't love the idea of them in open cages in the hot weather, with kids poking their fingers in the cages and otherwise harassing them. Don't think I will be back here."}
{"text":"Love this place!  A true hidden gem, service isnt always the best but the food and atmosphere is excellent!  Whenever we are in the area, we stop in for a beer and a pretzel."}
{"text":"My first visit here was last night with visitors- what a treat. Sergio was knowledgeable and friendly and helped us navigate the menu. The tots with goat cheese and herbs are amazing. We will definitely be returning with friends. We live in chandler and are thrilled we have this nearby!"}
{"text":"For the most part I have had really great experiences at The Perch.  The food is good and they have friendly servers.  My last visit the hostess team was disappointing and as the first people we interacted with they really brought down my experience.   I have high expectations for people who work customer service.  Very disappointed in them.  Great servers though!"}
{"text":"Okay, this might be \"The Place\" for me in Chandler. Tucked away in an alley, in what appears to be an old converted auto shop property or something similar, the ownership has done an amazing job of providing a tropical rainforest feel with the wonderful birds and vegetation. Go meet \"Hercules\", what an amazingly beautiful creature. Anyway, the taco carnitas are A M A Z I N G! Good breakfast menu now too! The local beers are fantastic. Great place to catch a game on weekends or listento some good acoustic music up on the roof. Check it out! I'll probably be there. Staff working there are great, and very welcoming."}
{"text":"The Perch is a great out door bar and the ambiance is like no other in the Chandler. Being a craft brew bar they have a wide range of tasty beers. Not to mention the roof top bar is nice change of scenery."}
{"text":"I liked it. I was pretty wrecked when I was there, I slightly remember eating a pizza, and listening to a guitar player and a lot of birds. Props to the staff for putting up with our obnoxiousness. I think it has potential to be my favorite bar in Chandler."}
{"text":"In house beer pub grub in a line. The real fun part here is all of the areas they have to explore.

As I write this review on a 116 degree day I am glad I am not perched atop the bar, but on a nice fall evening I could not think of a better place to enjoy a solid beer (I had the stout) and one of the best all be it pricey bar pretzels. It was nice that the pretzel included cheese and mustard, as I hate having to decide.

I am not sure how I feel about the giant cage of squawking, trapped birds dropping feces to the ground near the entrance however. Also parking was a bit akward on a dirt lot across from the alley entrance."}
{"text":"Rude hostesses, rude servers, not so great food. Definitely not worth the hour and fifteen minute wait for a table when we saw empty tables the entire time.
Tyler made this visit a little more bearable."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday dinner and had a very disappointing experience! Our waiter seemed confused and was very annoyed that he had to do separate checks. He hardly talked to us at all besides making rude or snarky comments. Some of our friends got service faster at the bar than through our waiter! It's been 17 minutes and counting and we still have not gotten our drinks! Terrible service. .. so disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance. Very open with awesome patios. Could be a problem in summer? Good beer selection, but waiting for their own brews. Our food was excellent, we had the green chili pork sandwich with an egg on ciabatta bun, and the sweet potato tots were awesome. Place a bit off the beaten path, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place just gets worse every time we come. This place is officially off our rotation list, which is unfortunate since it's so close to home. Awful service, food has gone downhill, and beers are the only saving grace but we can get that pretty much anywhere. 

Also, they've failed numerous health inspections very recently, google it."}
{"text":"Every time we come here we have a great time! The food and drinks are always delicious and the service is always great. I've never been here during the day but night time gets pretty busy. Get there early if you don't want to wait!"}
{"text":"Yes, the birds are cool, but ultimately I am coming for the beer. And the beer is not so great. Last time we were here they were out of almost everything (only one of their own beers on tap). What's the point of coming to a brewery if all I can drink is domestics? Seems like I ended up in a menagerie of Coors Light and macaws....bummer."}
{"text":"Ambience is really cool. Good service. Wish the food matched. Had a Cuban. Super dry, hard to eat could not finish. Wife had Salad, didn't like. Tots are frozen from a bag. Oreida? Unfortunately, ambience is not as important as the food quality, thus a 2 star. May try again. Not sure."}
{"text":"Service is painfully slow. They're very nice but don't stop here in a rush. At night music is loud and I feel for the poor animals. I even saw a server scream at a bird for squaking too laud and throw ice at it. I felt so sad. It has potential to be a cool place but it's not for me"}
{"text":"Awesome beer awesome Cuz and Ronn was an incredible server. The tater tarts were amazing as were the chicken wings. Also the vegetable appetizer was out of this world"}
{"text":"Great new craft beer and wine restaurant with an awesome 2nd floor patio. It's worth checking out for drinks and appetizers on a nice night. Mind you, they have a few kinks to iron out, but lots of potential for this spot in downtown Chandler. 

We decided to check it out on a weekend evening for dinner. Be sure to call ahead for reservations! Our wait was about 45 minutes, but there were a couple seats at the bar upstairs. The view is neat because it's unique to the area. You can see the lights on South Mountain and tops of neighboring buildings. Downstairs they have an exotic bird exhibit featuring some really colorful avians. Truly living up to their name in more ways than one!

Ready to imbibe, I tried the Deschutes River Ale, a golden blonde beer that won't fill you up before dinner. If you know me, you know I like blondes. They have all kinds of great specials on beer, wines and mixed drinks too.

For dinner, we ordered the chips and three kinds of dip: Guacamole (pretty good), mango mix (really good), and something with red peppers (not so good). Also, we tried their Southwest \"Margarita\" pizza, topped with mozzarella, tomato, chimichurri sauce, and chili infused olive oil. A slightly spicier take on the original margherita, it was decent but not outstanding. It could be improved with a crispier crust. Our waiter seemed inexperienced, at one point leaving us for a while after we had reminded him to bring the check. Overall, the staff was nice but seemed overwhelmed.

I'm really looking forward to returning. This place has the makings of being an excellent stop in my Chandler rotation."}
{"text":"We made reservations for a large party days in advance.  When we arrived there was no reserved table. Disappointing. Once we were finally seated the service and food were fair. Nothing to write home about.  Great location and staff was helpful."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended to me. I came here for my birthday. To be honest, other than the ambience, it was really disappointing. The service was terrible. My boyfriend liked his hamburger but it definitely was not worth $16. To be fair, I misinterpreted the menu and was not expecting a prime rib sandwich.. Which I did not like. Possibly, the other food is better. Overall, it was just a huge disappointment. What I received was not worth the $50 bill they slapped down (mind you, that was just dinner for 2, no alcohol.) I won't be making a return visit."}
{"text":"Service can be spotty at times.  Food is decent.  The patio is absolutely fantastic and so is the beer selection."}
{"text":"Great food and beer's! The setting is really cool with a canopy of tree's and tropical bird's all around. Great experience and a great brewery for the whole family to enjoy."}
{"text":"We came for happy hour because the food seemed to be a highlight of this establishment  and we felt the prices were a bit high for a brewery.  We had the pretzel bites and japelpeno marmalade tots, as well as a flight.  

Our server saved The Perch from the dreaded one star.  Billy, was very attentive and brought alley a bowl of water.  Although they don't allow dogs on their patio they had no problem with Alley.  Billy treated us both great! 

Alley said the birds were quite distracting but she was able to behave her best.  She thought the pretzels were ok with cheese but not good enough to finish the serving.  The numerous flies, annoyed her human but provided her with  some sport. 

The beer is average with the Rye so Mad being the best.  Preztel bites lacked flavor.  The jalapeno marmalade tots were the best part of the experience.  The ranch, if not homemade, tasted homemade.  .

The absolute worst part of this experience were the numerous flies we had to continue to try to get rid of.   They need to try to increase the sanitation of the establishment by decreasing the massive amount of flies."}
{"text":"Hidden place nestled back just past parking lot. I own the motorcycle shop next door so have been frequenting this place for lunch. I walk in, am usually instantly seated. (Middle of day) I walk through the enormous dungeon door to sit at one of the tables often at the edge so I can people watch. I  get the chicken tenders every time as I'm afraid of change. Very cool concept. Neat looking place. My pet peeve is the flies buzzing about. They are absolutely everywhere. Not that I care that I look like I have a mild case of Tourettes swatting them off my face/food and drinks but I'm pretty sure I may have tasted at least 2-3 of them when they try to steal crumbs from my beard. I guess the problem is I wasn't drinking or I probably wouldn't had given two shits and maybe even would had shared some of my food despite what the little bastards already stole.  I had to continuously remind myself to keep my shit together and refrain from punching one of my chicken tenders with a fly slowly lifting a tender out of my basket to fly away with it.  Such a cool place...  Let's do something about the greedy flies that don't like to share. Maybe let a bird or two fly away and replace with some chameleons."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere! Very good food, great beer and fantastic service. Ross, our server,  was professional and made great recommendations. We will absolutely return."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for meeting friends, quiet dinner or playing giant Jenga. Enjoy the rooftop at sunset with their own brewed beer and amazing food.
Great place for any evening."}
{"text":"Waited 30 mins for a table for 2 and was placed on a bench in the corner of the bar meant for 20 people. Had to complain to get a open table that hadn't been bussed. Bar staff and waitress were nice, however staff at the front could use some work."}
{"text":"Great little spot! I love the outdoor seating with the parrots. The inside is a cool little bar style restaurant. The inside is warmer than the outside patio! You are better off to sit outside in the shade with the misters on- than to sit indoors. I've had the margarita pizza, which is very good. A little spice- but not too much. I've also had the caesar salad, spinach and artichoke grilled cheese, and who can pass up a mimosa on a Sunday morning brunch! Great for couples, families, and work lunches. Located in the heart of downtown Chandler and parking had never been a problem."}
{"text":"The burgers and wings are phenomenal! It has a good atmosphere and friendly wait staff. I especially love the birds. The \"perch\" theme is truly unique and worth experiencing. This is one of those places that you just gotta visit, at least once."}
{"text":"Tucked away near downtown Chandler, you would have to be deliberately searching for this spot--and we are happy friends recommended it to us. The Perch brews were unique and stellar. The Rosemary IPA is so strange, but worth a sampling. If it were a bit cooler you likely can't beat the spot for patios and outdoor relaxing with friends. Several different areas and at times we felt like we were in Mexico."}
{"text":"Just because anyone can brew there own beer not everyone should! This place is horrible. Cool atmosphere but everything else is the worst. Go to San Tan if you want real beer."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, a solid three stars. First off, we used the \"no wait\" app which told us to arrive at 6:20 on a Thursday night. When we arrived she said it would be 45- an hour. I asked why and bath blah blah... anyway we were leaving and I got a text that our table was ready. I think they opened an area for us. When our food came, my husband's was missing -- the server dropped it... 10 min later he got his prime dip (which is served open faced and hard to dip). I had the green chile pork pizza which could've been so good had they drizzled enchilada sauce or sour cream on top. The boys got tiny, but yummy cheeseburgers for $8.50 each (cringe). We waited and waited for boxes and our check. I guess this would be a great spot for people sans kids and lots of time. Oh, no discount for the late/dropped food. Great beer selection, obviously."}
{"text":"Great place to meet with friends on the patio up top! The food is lovely and the beer selection is adventurous as well as plain so it's great for everyone. They also have great cocktails. You can't forget about the ambiance created by the aviaries filled with rescued birds!"}
{"text":"I met girlfriends for brunch and had a great time. We were seated promptly. We ordered lunch and asked for a pretzel to start. Service was slow, but that was fine with us because it gave us more time to chat. If you're in a hurry, this is not the place to go to. I would guess it took 45 minutes from when we ordered to when we received our food. The pretzel came out with our meal, which was fine, but would have been nice to nibble on while waiting for our meal. The waitress apologized stating that the kitchen didn't read her note about wanting the pretzel first.  My Prime Dip was delicious and everyone enjoyed their food in exception for the tamale. Overall, I enjoyed my experience and would return."}
{"text":"A craft beer bar/ bird sanctuary. Let that sink in for a bit. 

This place is great, but why three stars? First the good... The location is awesome; this place looks like it used to be an old workshop converted into a multiple layered brewery and food spot. 

Perch boast three areas for sipping; a rooftop lounge area, and outdoor patio with misters for those hot AZ summers, and a indoor bar fully equipped with craft beer and cocktail options. Within these all of these locations are birds, lots of them; mostly parrots, cockatiels, and other brightly colored feathered friends. All of the birds here are tropical rescues that now have a home at the Perch. They get to spend their days enjoying fruits, veggies, and the occasional gawker, taking multiple photos. I.E. - Me!

I didn't have any food during my visit, but I did sample a few beers. I was feeling \"hoppy\" so I ordered - The Perch Parka DIPA and the Beast Thunderbird. The Perch Parka was delicious, with a super smooth finish and not the normal strong IPA after taste, even for a double. The Beast Thunderbird was very \"bitey\" and left me feeling buzzed after just one glass. I mean a nine percent beer will do that to ya! 

We sipped these tasty brews on the rooftop portion of the bar and that's when then bad starts to come into play. The all the furniture on the rooftop area was dirty and dusty. I've eaten at plenty of rooftop bars and they manage to keep it clean, what's the issue here? 

There was also a lot noticeable ripped furnishings stacked and stashed around the venue. Which did make the place feel cluttered and unkempt. Our server even tripped over them a few times after dropping off our drinks. 

I do like the idea around this place and the beer is great, but just a few things need to be remedied. Would I come back? Yes, but I would sit inside or on the front patio near Opie the bird. 

Squawk!"}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere at this place but wish there was more seating. The few times I have been it has been overly crowded with barely enough room to stand and it has been really difficult to get the attention of the bartenders. When you are standing on a patio bar during the summer in AZ you don't want to have to wait 15 minutes just to be acknowledged by a server. You're thirsty!"}
{"text":"Very unimpressed.  This place is average at best.  To be completely honest, the experience started off annoying and that may have jaded me.  We had reservations as we expected it to be crowded.  It actually wasn't that bad as there were a LOT of empty tables.  The Hostess looked around and basically picked the absolutely worst table that I could see.  It was the only one with no umbrella and had no shade what so ever.  It was also in between to very large groups with lots of children.  I asked if we could change tables and she was incredibly \"put off.\"  She had such attitude.  Management needs to address this as she is the first impression that a customer has.  I would have happily mentioned this if the manager or anyone had bothered to walk around and actually interact with the customers.  The food was ok but nothing exciting.  The server seemed just bored to be working there.  There are a lot of nice places in the square so walk by here and look at the birds but don't waste your time and money eating at this one."}
{"text":"Unique atmosphere, they have tons of exotic birds at the restaurant which is pretty cool but also a little gross since you are eating! Food was great, I had the Mac and cheese and would definitely recommend! Fun outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"Not much to say, decent food and beer but nothing to write home about. 
There are birds around the patio and outdoor seating area. Nothing else exciting going on."}
{"text":"I wanted to go for my birthday so we made reservations for Sunday brunch.  There was no waiting when we arrived (that's the one star).  We were seated and then waited about 15 minutes for a server to tell us she didn't know we were her table.  Not a problem.  She took our drink orders and we waited.  Another 15 or so minutes went by and my 2 and 4 year olds needed to move so when I got up to bring them to their second trip to the restroom, another server came by and took more drink orders.  Then the first drinks arrived and we ordered (this all took about 30 minutes).  Second drinks arrived but she looked horrified when she saw we already had drinks and didn't leave them with us.  She should have because refills were a wait.  Food was just ok after we waited another 30 minutes for it.  The worst part was waiting 45 minutes for the check.  45 minutes and asking 4 waitstaff/hostesses.  Finally, we were granted the opportunity to pay for this lousy experience when someone (hostess?  Manager?) shoved a ticket in my husband's direction.  Hours were spent here when it should have been an hour and a half, tops.  My kids were behaving as well as they could but come on, at their ages you can only expect so much.  They could have seated 3 parties in the time that was wasted and mismanaged.  A manager did come and refill my mimosa at one point and said \"happy birthday\" and not that I would expect a freebee but some kind of compensation for this horrible service would have been appreciated.  Horrible birthday experience and if we were dishonest people, we could have easily walked without paying the check."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, brews, people, setting and most importantly food all get 5 stars. We had the cheese and bacon tater tots for starters, they were cheesy and smokey, and helped with the slight buzz from the craft brews. The Perch Peach ale was rich, highly recommend. We shared and thoroughly enjoyed the green chili pork brick oven pizza and the hammered bird (grilled chicken sandwich), both were tasty and more flavorful than we expected. East Valley needs more places like The Perch; we'll be back."}
{"text":"There are few bars that I've been to in the last five years and this one was the best I've ever been to!  I must admit I got a little buzzed too fast but the night was so relaxed and peaceful, especially from the top balcony. Amazing. We had Moscow Mules which were delish."}
{"text":"The Briza is different but an excellent breakfast pizza. It's made with pizza with eggs, bacon, sausage and cheese. No red sauce. It is a great way to eat breakfast for brunch.
The birds make it even more interesting. If you like brewery beer, this is the place to try many choices.
Much of their seating is outside with heaters. Bring a coat or blanket if the weather is chilly and you end up outside. 
Lots of yummy choices for brunch lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Came here because I tried their zilla cuke beer at another establishment and was hoping to get a pint. Unfortunately they didn't have it but that's ok.  Their lemon beer was pretty good. I was impressed by the atmosphere and I really enjoyed the birds!

My boyfriend and I sat on the top patio. It was DEAD. And I felt for our bartender, Randall,who was trapped up there all alone with no music or anything in the AZ heat. He was friendly and gave us great service. we ordered the poutine tots and sausage board to share. Both were good and filling.

The only gripe I have about this place, and I know they're not a house band or anything, but they had some horrendous live band playing who just butchered classic song after song. Almost made me want to leave to avoid hearing them anymore....

Needless to say I'll definitely be coming back. Beer, food, service were all up to par. Just have to hope the next time I go the live music is up to par as well!!! Make sure to go visit Randall on the top patio and keep him some company!"}
{"text":"The scenery is enchanting. I highly recommend the Belgian Peach, then another. Other beer options are great. Their food menu changed about 6 months ago, This revised menu could use another revision...

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I am so good when it comes to having date ideas now. I am, THE BEST. It's mainly Yelp's fault for making me this good. Silly Yelp. Without Yelp, places like The Perch would be non-existent for me. I would not know that I can skip the zoo and just head over to The Perch to check out elegant birds. I would not know that I have a hip, trendy, and chill roof-deck place to take my unassuming dates and look like a genius *brilliant*

I have not eaten here, to be frank. I actually only had two glasses of wine. It was my first \"date\" in nearly 4 years. I was on my game. The date lasted nearly 3 hours, time flew by. The ambiance upstairs kept us chatting forever, the roof-deck overlooking the revamped Chandler streets. I was not going to beer it up on a date, but I can tell you they had a great list of local craft brews ready to be consumed. I also checked out the menu, which looks pretty solid. You pay a bit for the ambiance, which is primarily a jungle-infused hipster heaven filled with trees and a party deck upstairs for the misbehaving 20-somethings. They also have a niche bar downstairs you can walk into and slap down a couple brews. This place is a chameleon: 1/3 Restaurant, 1/3 Bar, 1/3 Party Deck.

Let me make it simple for those looking for a hip place to take a date: 

Gentlemen: Take your Friday night date. Your arm goes around her neck as she notices the birds frolicking in the cage. You dine outside and eat a light dinner. Then go upstairs for a couple cocktails and great conversation. You win.

Ladies: Make sure you go out with a good guy who has a great smile and is funny. Does he smell good? OK good. Don't eat too much or drink too much. Make him pay for it all, you rock. Check out the birds. If he doesn't like the birds, ditch him and go upstairs, lol.

4 stars overall for the ambiance, versatility of amenities, and great waitstaff who are attentive and personable upstairs. I can't wait to come back and try the food. If its nearly as good as I expect, I will add a 5th star. Scouts honor."}
{"text":"Yes, as all the other reviews say, the atmosphere is amazing. It's a great place to relax on a sunny afternoon, with just the birds or with friends. The service was friendly and attentive at both the bar inside and the bar on the rooftop deck. However, for it being called \"The Perch Brewery\", I found the beer to be very lacking. I even went back to retaste some of these beers to double check. I tried a flight of 5 beers (witbier, saison, rye ipa, porter, and spiced stout) downstairs and finished with their brown ale on the deck. I normally love hoppy and darker styles but there was a seriously off flavor in the rye ipa, porter, and spiced stout that went way past the typical toasty, roast, or slightly burnt flavors. I detected a tannic, astringent off flavor (like sucking on a black tea bag or drinking very young red wine) and am honestly in shock that the brewers/management/customers haven't done anything about it. Maybe they steep the mash too long or too hot? Whatever it is, I'll definitely only be doing cocktails next time."}
{"text":"We used to love this place. It was cold as for us up stairs/outside we asked for a heater they said no problem we waited waited and waited started it ourselves. Took forever drinks she went up and down the stairs three times still no drinks finally my mom and I got ours by the time we were done our friend got his too also had no idea what the beers we're like what they tasted like what was red what was ale nothing ,nothing"}
{"text":"Great find! Danielle did a great job.  Food is very good, great happy hour and fun atmosphere.  No more rude El Zacolo or mediocre Coach and Willies....Chef Off on Monday June 16!"}
{"text":"We walked in at 905 tonight ready to enjoy the beautiful atmosphere and food. It took 10 min before they took our drink order. 5 min later, we got the \"late night menu\". The menu states it started at 10pm. We had to hand over the regular menu. We waited another 7 min then walked out. So very disappointed! We love this place but tonight's experience was tragic. No vegetarian options on night menu other than pretzels. (Again, not even close to 10pm) No drinks on our table. It hurts me to write this review. I give the 2 stars because of the wonderful patio. We now know not to show up for a late dinner."}
{"text":"The service is EXTREMELY slow... Otherwise it would have been 5 stars. Had to ask for our sever several times. Our food was delish! We had a reservation and our table was not ready when we arrived even though they were slow. We were sat in a very dark area of the patio and had to use cell phones for lights....  We had to ask for more lighting... Seemed obvious to us but not to the staff...."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and liked it. The food is pretty good and they really have some creative things! The atmosphere is amazing! (Unless you have a bird phobia. Then you're screwed) Sitting outside is great if the weather cooperates. The service .....meh. There hasn't been a hostess at the front any time I have been there. The wait staff are either too slow or understaffed and stretched too thin. They are nice when you flag them down, however. I will go back and hope for the service to improve."}
{"text":"The interior of the restaurant is very dark.  Most of the seating is outside by the bird cages, so not a great place for cold or rainy weather.  Their beer selection is decent, but there are not really any descriptions of what each one is.  I ordered what was called an American Pale Ale, but when it was served it was actually a Red Pale.  There is definitely a flavor difference between the two.  The bartender was not very helpful when I asked about it and told me that it is still a pale ale.  The birds are a nice distraction for an otherwise disappointing restaurant."}
{"text":"I was really excited to have brunch here before going to the Ostrich fest. Ive heard great things, but may have had higher hopes. I loved the ambience with the outdoors and upper deck, but we came to eat and not just for the looks. The menu was already limited, no variety, and they were out of their main items. My friend and I shared the fried green tomatoe sliders which were really dry and we shared a shrimp salad as well that we didnt even finish because it was so dry and bland. On a ppsitive note, the bartenders were really friendly! I would come back here for the selection of porters and to party, but not for the food."}
{"text":"One of the more peculiar restaurant mashups that you'll ever encounter.  The patio is a fun experience and the eclectic ambiance is akin to a poor man's Adventureland without the Disneyland markup.  I'd love to hear the story behind the decision to combine the two.

The food is decent bar fare. Nothing exceptionally memorable, but then again most bar food isn't.  The green pork appetizer was a highlight.

After awhile the novelty does wear a little thin.  That can primarily be attributed to the harsh squawking of the dozens of Macaws, Cockatoos, Amazons, and other parrots that are socializing a few feet away.  When that happens you best head upstairs to the rooftop lounge.

All in all a fun, unique, and authentic experience.  Just one more highlight in an ever improving  downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"Spinach and artichoke grilled cheese is to die for!! Interesting beers and great food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great food!  However, we had to wait for our food for over ano hour. The manager came by and apologized. He said he would comp us all deserts. Good thing we only ordered two (4 of us at dinner)!  We had to wait another 20 minutes for those and then the waitress said she could only comp 1 of them! Sad part is we really liked the ambience of the place and the food was good so we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest places to get some drinks and/or some food. I went here one night with my girlfriend and met up with a few friends. They have so many tasty beers to try that they brew right there. The atmosphere was awesome with an outdoor rainforest feel and they had a live musician that sounded really amazing playing an amplified acoustic guitar and singing into a mic that had a really loud and clear loud quality. I will be coming back here again for sure! Even just for the free show!"}
{"text":"What a great little spot in downtown Chandler!  I didn't get to experience the food offerings, but we did go for some drinks and had a great time!  We spent most of the night upstairs on the outdoor deck and that was a lot of fun.  It actually reminded me of the bars I have been to in both NY and FL.  There was music playing, a nice cocktail list and a nice atmosphere.  I chose the Pims as I have always wanted to try that and it was good.  

I am looking forward to going back and trying the food.  We didn't spend much time downstairs but it looked pretty cool down there too.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down.... Best place in Chandler! Great spot, great food, and awesome beer! Love the rescue birds. Awesome spot! Highly recommend..."}
{"text":"After my last visit/review - it's been over a year since I have been to The Perch. Figured if they are still in business, they must have gotten their act together and with my Mom and Stepdad in town - I wanted to bring them somewhere unique. Came for Sunday breakfast and had the BLT breakfast sandwich (which they forgot to put the Bacon on but the server was quick to get it on the side for me) and my parents both had the biscuits and gravy. Both were delicious, came out quickly, and the server was great. Hoping it wasn't just a fluke because I really liked this place aside from the service. Adding a star - will add more eventually if the experience sticks but for now, they've regained a customer. :)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, this place use to be a bird sanctuary, the kept the birds when the turned it into a pub & bar. I love all the trees and birds. They have a roof top you can sit and drink, the food was really good and everything comes with tater tots. Prices are good for the portions. I'm going back and I recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for lunch. They had a good variety of beers, great tropical atmosphere with birds, and good food. There aren't good signs on Arizona Ave so you need to know where you're going. Parking is good but it's across from restaurant, not in front of it. I think the atmosphere is the jewel of this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is the best! All the bartenders are super cool and very very tentative. I've been there a few time the past weekends cause I moved back into the area and they already know me by name and what I drink! Had some of the eats and that was amazing too! I would gladly send anyone here it's awesome for friends and also amazing for family's! You can defiantly say I'm a regular lazy bird at the perch...BOOM GO GET DRUNK OR FULL."}
{"text":"This place is ok but nothing spectacular.  The concept is interesting but the server was rude and the service in general was underwhelming.  Having new places to try out is always cool but after being here twice I'm not going to spend any money there any time soon."}
{"text":"What a dump. Upon entering you will be greeted by the stench of nasty kitchen smell. Nothing is clean here. Service is slower than constipation and I've had better food from 7-11. Avoid this place. Even in this wasteland called Arizona there are better options."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Chandler! If you like outdoor restaurants and bars, this is your place. Food and service great well. My new favorite place!"}
{"text":"I tried to make a reservation here for my birthday here and it was a nightmare. First off, they wouldn't even let me reserve a simple couch area on the rooftop, and placed my table in the garden which I guess was OK. On top of that, after calling the restaurant they had me literally TEXT a personal phone number of the reservation specialist. Not only was she delayed on responses, after somewhat \"scheduling\" in, she texted me back a few hours later with a message that read \"When is this reservation for? Lol\" The lack of professionalism was shocking. She never followed up, and I never even got a confirmation after I had to \"remind\" her of the scheduled date. I have had some pretty bad service here before, so that was the icing on the cake. We went down the street and had my birthday celebration at The Brickyard. It was amazing, and they were so accommodating. The Perch needs to step it up and maybe rethink they're employee's capability if they want to keep up with the other great bars that are literally next door."}
{"text":"We loved the good food, generous portions, and fun atmosphere. Service was attentive but not overbearing. 
We will eat here again."}
{"text":"Great tasting food (not cheap, though). Had the house burger, well made. The tater-tots were the best I've had in awhile, definitely worthy of a return trip.

The atmosphere was nice; sat outside and enjoyed the parrots, Macaes, parakeets, etc., that they have.

Service was kinda bad for a first-visit: server took a long-time to first visit us (we had enough time to look over the entire menu and then some). Appetizer was almost shoved in front us by another server, and our server disappeared completey and only returned for the check (we had both finished our waters and were sucking on nothing).

I'd try them again for the tots, but won't anticipate having to leave much of a tip."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp (thanks yelpers!)- a little off the beaten path. We were lucky enough to snag the last indoor table on this chilly night as the majority of the place is outside seating. I can't wait to come back on a nice day. 

Enjoyed the craft beers- I had the rosemary IPA. 

Good variety of food, including sandwiches, burgers, salads, flat breads, various apps and other items. We really liked the tamales and tater tots. 

Cute, local restaurant. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Still using the soft opening excuse. No one greeted us today. Server on the roof recommend a beer they were out of. Went to sit downstairs and found it difficult to be served. We had a table just no server. With the exception of Andrew, I found the entire staff to be rude and lacking knowledge of their own menu. Our server never introduced himself and seemed to lack server experience. My wife was greeted at the table to a totally offensive \"joke\" tied to the mason candle. I think it may have fallen off before we left.  We actually had a female server stop at our table to ask US about what we eating.     I went with excitement but left very disappointed. I will give them another try in a few weeks when the soft opening is over."}
{"text":"Love the outdoor atmosphere during the months the weather is nice.  The outdoor birds and checkers on the tree stumps keeps the kids busy while we wait for the food, which is amazing.  Love that they serve tater tots instead of fries and they are so crispy. The panko chicken tenders are so good.  
Good brews too!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our first visit to the Perch.  The atmosphere here is amazing and really hard to beat, especially right around dusk.  The birds are entertaining, they have a good beer list and the food is interesting.  Basically pub food with a few twists.  All and all, a terrific evening. We will be back.  Tip:  put the address in google as it's not super nice day to find, but google takes you straight to the front door."}
{"text":"I will admit...my first 20 minutes, I was thinking previous reviews were correct about service. It was a tad slow. But the place...y'all... what a great vibe! I live in Oregon currently and will be moving to AZ soon. I appreciate chill, laid-back, vibes! I was happy to sit downstairs on the patio, listening to the beautiful birds! The vibe was relaxed and once we did get our server, the service took off to excellent. He apologized for delay and then another server checked on us...and a manager. We felt very well taken care of at that point. My hubby and I had the carnitas green chile/ beer cheese app (stir it) and I had Perch chicken strips as an entree and loved the crunchy panko batter with tots. My favorite beers were the weizen/wheat beers. We also checked out the over 21-rooftop bar---how fun on a balmy, beautiful night! We will be back and we will bring our guests when we move here as a \"go-to\" place."}
{"text":"Great little gem in downtown Chandler that has quality food and even better beer!  Happy hour is from 2-7 and had great food and drink specials. I will be up on the rooftop patio enjoying the sun next time I go."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, beer is great...see Efay in the bar...such amazing customer service the hubby and I keep coming back!!"}
{"text":"Had a very nice dining experience here with the hubby. We are bird lovers, however, and have a parrot at home so I'm used to parrot noise. If that really bothers you I'm not sure I'd recommend this place. We sat outside in the garden area but maybe they don't have birds up on the roof or inside. The pizza and salad were good and the service was great. I'm not a fan of sweet salad dressing but the strawberry balsamic vinaigrette was surprisingly not bad. I found a white wine I liked and hubby found a good beer (he's very particular). They will be brewing their own beer here soon. Loved the atmosphere. It was great for a temperate early evening in March but we'll have to see what it's like about the middle of July!"}
{"text":"Always good service, great beer brewed on site.
The wings are the best in town."}
{"text":"I like this place - the indoor bar ambience, the squawking tropical birds outside, and the Perch Burger with tater tots. While the beers are not quite as excellent as those at AZ Wilderness, just a few miles up the road, the service here and the food itself is much better. And the Perch in-house beer selection is huge and constantly rotating, with a few guest handles always available. 
Ife, who's been behind the bar nearly every few  times I've been here over the past months, is cool and generous with samples of different beers."}
{"text":"First time there. It's also a bird sanctuary which is cool. Seems like they put jalapeños in just about everything. Lots of different beers. Food was so so."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times.  The beer ad wine is great!  I love sitting I the roof top.  I have had the wings, tater tots, sausage platter, and hummus.  All were fantastic.  I can't wait to try more food here.  Pricing is pretty good ad the happy hour prices are solid.  I recommend coming here at least once.  They have only been open a month and are still working out some of the kinks but I love this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!
So not only is the atmosphere cool but the food is killer! I came here with some friends and we ate so much delicious food!
The goat cheese tots are so delicious, I can't even explain it. 
The pig wings literally come clean off the bone! And the dipping sauces, dear lord the combo!
My husband and I had 2 of the specials that night both on the beer bread, which is great by itself! I had chicken that was cooked perfectly! 
And the beer selection, was on point! 
This place does not disappoint!
I will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place, felt like we were inside of an aviary!  We missed happy hour prices.  Ordered a mac and cheese dish...wow, I missed the basic price because it wasn't really clear on the menu.  I added on stuff and it ended up being like $10 or more for a small bowl.  Yikes!!!  What did order was good, but pricey.  Good selection of beer.

We noticed when we were leaving they have a seating area on top of the restaurant.  Now that its cooler outside, it will be nice to check this place out again and view downtown Chandler from up high."}
{"text":"It almost bothers me to give this place 2 stars on one hand, on the other, it should be 1 star. I'm going to spell this out simply:

The service SUCKS.

I have been to The Perch twice. Once on a Wednesday evening, and once yesterday, Saturday Feb 21. Shall I bore you with all of the details, or are you just reading to get the big parts? Read below for the big parts, skip to the bottom for the details.

One my first visit, we arrived and got seated up stairs for Happy Hour. It took 15 minutes for the server to initiate contact. We know this isn't an all night affair, let's get to it, ya know? We ordered tator tots, and were served the garlic herb tots. The tots were good, but after the drink orders took as long to get there as the tots, we were a bit annoyed. We were looking for a quickie, and they were playing hard to get. No bueno. We had an issue with a beverage, and a server (different from the one who was serving us) came to the table to see how things were. We informed her of the drink issue, and her attitude was dismissive and left to get our server instead of dealing with the issue. It took 25 minutes to get the correct drink. 

On the Saturday visit, we sat at the downstairs bar. It took me having to physically grab a server and ask her who was helping us after being there for 20 minutes. Me, because I am bold, and unapologetic about expecting good service, said to her,
\"We have been here twice. The food is awesome, and the service has been terrible. Why?\"
Her response, \" We are understaffed and I am working 8 tables right now.\" 
I said, \"It's Saturday afternoon.... It's going to be busy.\"
She nodded in agreement.
This followed an order of Sangria in which they told me that they had \"lost\" the bottles of Sangria, and couldn't fulfill my order. LOST THE BOTTLES OF SANGRIA. Understand, we were FULLY SET on sitting at The Perch and making it a solid day of day drinking. We didn't have the opportunity; she dropped the check on us after she lost the Sangria. We spent $50 for lunch for 2 and it could have been well north of $100 each had we been able to sit and enjoy the day.  

The service blows. The food is awesome. But wading through the bullshit of the bad service makes this place a complete miss for me. I'll find a place with decent to average ambiance but better service and settle in there for a day of day drinking: I'm thinking San Tan? I'm up for suggestions, though."}
{"text":"I've been there several times and have never been disappointed. The food is great but my honest motivation is the birds it's just a delightful Garden restaurant and never fails 2 bring joy to those I bring."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere! Very aesthetically beautiful. The birds are lovely, it feels as though you're in a rainforest! The beer is good, the food could have been better. No complaints about the service. I will be back!"}
{"text":"A seemingly great day to hang out at the upstairs bar. On the way to the bar you walk by a half a dozen dirty bird cages only to sit down at an almost equally dirty outdoor area with ashtrays overflowing. Not being a beer drinker, I ordered my usual Bombay Sapphire martini. I watched the bar man make it. He was doing everything right including swirling and dumping out the vermouth out of the glass for an extra dry martini, he even stirred the gin being carful not to bruise it. My excitement faded when I tasted it. I thought it was illegal to water down liquor. There was absolutely no doubt that this was. And just to add insult to injury, it was a short pour. On to the food. The presentation on the carne asada tacos looked ok except that each of the three tacos had different portions of meat, cheese, and pickled onion. The taste of the meat was off. The jalapeño marmalade wings sounded good but were not. If you like cruel and unusual treatment of animals and watered down drinks with barely edible food than this is your place. Oh and I hope you like cigarette smoke because nothing says I'm enjoying the outdoors than second hand smoke."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place but they could work more on the food. It was not impressive. I would definitely go back to drink but wouldnt plan on eating there again."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Mac n cheese was wonderful and the tamale was fantastic too. Ask for Ron and he will really take care of you!! Thank you for the great service!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot to meet up with friends and have a cold drink...or two! Lots of choices for beer. I love the patio deck. Great add to the many choices in downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"Great place Have a beer on the perch  Good food and love how your seated along with the birds"}
{"text":"The coolest little hidden gem!!! If you like birds you HAVE to go here! The food was delicious, staff was friendly and we had a great time. I came here with about 15 of my co-workers for a team builder. It's almost all outside but they do have fans and heaters for the winter. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and beer is great, food not so much. Staff is friendly.  It's one of those places to go for good beer and a live band and to check out the exotic birds,  but if your looking to enjoy a full meal,  it's definitely not the place. We had pizza and it took over an hour to get, and then there was a black long hair in it...but like I said good beer..."}
{"text":"My favorite place in downtown Chandler, must try the jalapeño marmalade tots! Great service and rooftop!"}
{"text":"Great local brewery and lunch spot. Awesome outside and roof top seating. The aviary adds a great feel to the atmosphere. Service is attentive and friendly.  Very nice place to spend an afternoon or night out."}
{"text":"Had a great time at the perch! Taylor was an EXCELLENT server. She was very friendly and happy. She had a lot tables but was very attentive! Great atmosphere thank you Taylor!!!"}
{"text":"As a bird lover this is the best place to be! Great ambiance and good food. We often bring out of town guests here and they always love it!"}
{"text":"Always good, fun atmosphere love there food. Patio is so nice up top! Will be back most definitely"}
{"text":"Very cool place! My kids loved walking around and checking out the birds. Inside seating is limited and typical bar food. However, I would totally take out of town friends for a unique dining experience!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Love the birds. Food good and reasonable. Not fancy but good. Great staff"}
{"text":"First time, excellent sandwich. I had the Prime dip and my husband have the club. They were both delicious and the Brews are very good as well"}
{"text":"Good to see this place finally opened. It was a big remodel it seems and had some issues but it looks nice. The roofdeck is large but doesn't overlook the best parts of Chandler. The first floor is really nice, I really like the feeling in and around the bar - the patio is nice too but those birds... wtf. so loud. And I'm pretty sure they swear too lol. Just don't sit on the east side by them. 

Service is on the slow side... I wouldn't say the guys were mad.. but seemed preoccupied although there were a lot of people working and not doing a ton.. just felt like we were bothering him for a beer. Whatever.. I know they're new but that's an area that needs improvement. So expect that to get better over time.

Location isn't necessarily far from downtown - there's just nothing in between. A nice gravel lot; a grease trap of a fish and chips place and then you're there. Bam! 

Decent craft brew selection but both times I was there.. something else was out of stock. I mean it happens? but.. ok. 

Food... I had an appetizer.. so can't really mess that up but I'd eat it again.

Next time I'm in town I'll probably check it out again."}
{"text":"What the hell happened??? Used to LOVE this place. After the reopen the menu was cut in half and the prices doubled! $17/18 for a burger...$14 for a grilled cheese? Ridiculous! The food used to be delicious but quality has also been cut in half.  I ordered the grilled cheese, they used to be the best in town. They changed the way its made and the bacon was beyond burnt. Couldn't even finish it. I left feeling robbed. The music they play now is just horrible. Very disappointed. Please go back to to the way you were before the remodel, seriously. The only positive was the birds,  and the staff was nice."}
{"text":"This place is new and located in downtown chandler. It has only been open maybe 3 weeks and they have been doing a soft opening. The menu is limited to a few appetizers, salads, sandwiches and pizza. My friend and I both got salads and it was pretty good. The salad was very fresh and the dressing was tasty but light. The place is very open and it also offers a roof top patio space( nice to eat out on a sunny day). They have happy hour 2-7. I love that as soon as you walk into the place you see cages of live parrots. The birds are really pretty to look at but when your sitting close by them it's kinda annoying when it's squeaking by your ear. They have plenty of drinks to choose from but not all are available yet. The owner came around a few times to the tables to see if everyone was ourselves and that was nice. I'm giving them only four stars because they were understaffed the night we went and it took forever for the server to come and take our orders. Defiantly some room for improvement but it has great potential!"}
{"text":"First time here and reserved separate \"guest house\" for a surprise birthday party. Love this hidden little gem of a place.  Its not on the main street of downtown Chandler, however it is so unique that it has such a cool factor.
Our party order all their own meals and everyone raved about the taste, portion sizes and were so pleased.  We had our own personal server and she was so attentive and was patient with our large party. I just cant remember her name, sorry!
We moved around, as some were smokers and able to smoke on the outside patio and enjoyed the upstairs patio later that evening.  The older kids played corn hole and checkers.  The entire restaurant is outside and there are so many birds to watch and enjoy.
I have never been to such a unique restaurant designed as this hidden gem.  Will definitely be a destination to bring out of town guests or new patrons.  Was an all around fabulous evening and experience."}
{"text":"Great concept. Love the outdoor dining and fabulous rooftop patio. Food was good dinner was yummy...though not very diverse in selection. Drinks were good and plenty to choose from. Would have given 5 stars except for amount of open smokers and super drunk, over-served people. Hoping that 
last part gets fixed because this place has so much potential."}
{"text":"Whoa, this place gets packed on the weekends.  If you want to beat the crowds, come in the off hours.  I was pleasantly surprised by the attentive service our party of four received even though it was so busy.  What they lacked on tap, they made up for with bottles/cans of deliciousness like Myrcenary.  I wasn't too thrilled about the atmosphere because of all the birds in cages but I get it - it's The Perch."}
{"text":"What a great place! The atmosphere, food, beer and music were all great! The birds were so neat and great entertainment for the kids. The food was so delicious as well but a bit over priced. My two crab cakes were $17! They were so delicious and sauce served with them was amazing... But $17 is high in my opinion. The kids meals were $7 and decent portion size. I had a peach beer that was so good. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not only are the birds impressive on your way in, but the giant gate leading to the restaurant through the patio kind of blew my mind.  I was there for a football game with my friend and had heard good things about their beer.  I tried a number of differing varieties, but the one that I liked most was their ginger IPA.  Once I added a squeeze of lime to it, I was inspired for my next home brew.  I love it when beer inspires me, so we were off to a good start. 

We got the pizza and the poutine - the pizza was excellent, easily some of the best in the east valley.  The poutine, however, left a lot to be desired.  I remember it being soggy and forgettable, despite the great intentions.  I would go here almost any time over the loud and obnoxious San Tan Brewery around the corner, so I will be back.  Any excuse I can get to hang out in Downtown Chandler means I get Paletas Betty for dessert, which is never a bad thing!"}
{"text":"Food was great but we waited 45 minutes for a salad and some pork sliders to arrive.   Love the atmosphere as well,  we sat outside with the birds chirping.   Lovely!   Only downside is the slow service!"}
{"text":"When I think of the Perch as a work in progress, I feel much better about this place. As it is right now, they seem to be having an identity crisis - trying to be too many things to too many people. Example: the patio area - is it a waiting area? Is it an atrium? Is it a family eating area? The tables seem to be packed into every corner and you can't avoid being right next to the bird cages. 

What do I have against birds, you may ask? Nothing! But I knew this patio area before the Perch set up shop and I don't remember them ever being that loud. Now I feel like they're always on edge and stressed out - perhaps because of all the noise?

Indoor downstairs area REALLY feels like a bar. A dark, rugged sports bar feel. So if you go with kids, my recommendation is to sit outside. Unless your kids are into hanging out at sports bars. 

Rooftop bar is a cool concept but again - it's like they're trying to cater to a different crowd than what they're set up for on the ground level. 

The end result is that customers get a mixed experience in both service and food - some servers treating you like dinner guests and others treating you like bar patrons despite where you're sitting. It also translates into a menu that is all over the place. Seriously - their menu doesn't make sense and there's too much stuff on it. It creates an awkward experience just trying to sort through the menu because you can't get a sense of what they do well (I question Jack in the Box's menu for the same reasons). That said, the food is decent if you recognize they are 2 parts bar and 1 part restaurant. 

They also have recently started serving breakfast. Instead of fixing their current identity crisis they are adding more to the mix. Again, if they can narrow down what they want to accomplish I think they would be able to deliver a more consistent, enjoyable experience to patrons. I also think they need to rethink the bird situation - they are nice to look at, but not nice to eat with. I think it's also a bad environment for the birds."}
{"text":"Good vibe here- outdoor seating available good space upstairs. 30+ crowd. Good service and yummy food"}
{"text":"Love this place!!

Even in the middle of the hot Arizona summer I was able to enjoy a few cold ones on the rooftop deck. Great variety of draft beers with delicious food and friendly service.

I believe that this place is still a hidden gem in the middle of downtown Chandler. Ones it cools down a bit, suggest you check this place out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I have been to the Perch more than a few times. The experiences have decent up until now. There were 4 of us meeting (College friends) that had not reconnected for many years. I picked the Perch because one of the ladies was in town from Washington DC. I thought she might enjoy a nice, cute, local place. There were no issues with seating, or being greeted promptly. The waitress that served us during the evening, she simply was not the best. I am assuming she must be new? If she isn't, then you guys need to find better wait staff. She was not familiar with the menu at all. We asked her, easy questions about Happy Hour. She had to go back a few times to find out what food was on Happy Hour. In the menu there was a Happy Hour section on drinks, but not food. The food itself was actually pretty good. We had our tator tots come out first. Another server brought them out. He actually thought they went to adjacent table and almost sat them down there. That is OK, I get it, but when the table told him about the mix up, they said, those tots look good and were joking that they should get a few from ours. This waiter then came to our table and served the tots. He said, that it would be nice if we shared a few of the tots with the table next to us. I didn't agree and jokingly passed it off. He was adamant about it and grabbed a plate and took a few off for this table. SERIOUSLY? Ok, since I was with a group of friends I hadn't seen in years, I didn't want to cause a scene, so I made reference to about buying one of us a drink. He said, I might be able to do something. Of course, nothing was followed through or mentioned the rest of the evening. The rest of the food came out a few minutes later. My friend ordered a Moscow mule. The cup that it was served in, was sticky and a little gross. My friends and I agreed, why didn't the waitress grab a different mug? I am sorry but she had to have noticed the cups sticky nature, how could you not? My friend asked for a new cup, so the waitress brought it out. When the waitress asked us about the check, we said, we would be splitting it 4 ways, she said, that is fine. When the check came out, it was one check. I guess I am not sure why she bothered asking us if that was her intention the whole time. Here is what else bothered me: we were asked at least two times if we were ready with the check presenter. We were not. We were catching up on 24 years of time....she knew this. If there was a rush for us to pay the bill or she needed to leave, then tell us. Stop coming by every 10-15 minutes asking us if it is ready. The bill hadn't moved from the time she set it down. I was starting to feel pressure about leaving. Really, the Perch... I expected much better service than this. You have a \"unique restaurant\" but than in itself won't keep you in business much longer if you continue with this poor service!"}
{"text":"Absolutely dig this place!

The atmosphere is awesome...it's like you're in a birdcage or something.  

Had several small tastes of their local brews and I was surprisingly pleased.  

The food was delish and our server was more than willing to help us figure out what to try.  

I had the green chile pizza and it was delectable."}
{"text":"Excellent green chili pork!  I am a fan of all pork options and this one is cooked well.. The green chili pork sandwich with salsa verdes w fontina, cheddar and fried egg on ciabatta.  Nolan, our server, will take great care of you as well.  Lots of great beverage options as well if your into craft beer!  Check it out."}
{"text":"I really loved the Perch! The burger I had was great and got a side salad on the side that I still can't get off my mind. Beer was good and loved the birds as well. One bird in a tree pooped on a guy at our table so watch your food, LOL!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a fun place.  All the plants and birds make you forget you're in AZ.

I sat at the bar for lunch and had a great time.  The bartender was very helpful and knowledgeable and let me taste several beers.  I settled on their Belgian Peach and it was excellent.

My house burger and tots rounded out a very good meal."}
{"text":"I was initially really psyched about this place.  The ambience is cool, they have a great selection of beers, and the food is fine.  However, the last two or three times I've been there the service has been pretty dodgy.  If you have the time, check it out.  

This used to be one of my go-to places in Chandler, but there's no dearth of local beer and good food in the area with more consistent service."}
{"text":"Not the best but not horrible. I found this place because I was headed to Chandler to look for a business and saw that this was somewhere to eat at for a vegetarian because they have vegetarian options. When first arriving, didn't think it was a restaurant just because of all the houses near it and very limited road parking. Thank goodness there was parking in the dirt lot. The outside is very nice with all of the rescue birds and the inside was ok, a little tight but nothing horrible. We sat near the bar and the other customers were VERY loud the whole time we were there. I understand that it's a bar but in such a small place, it got irritating. Plus, it was only 2 in the afternoon. The food was ok too, nothing special. Overall, not too bad."}
{"text":"The food here is always AWESOME! But, I've had the same server twice in a row, and both times he has been rather rude. The first time I chalked it up to a bad day. I assumed the server couldn't possibly treat all of the guests that way. WRONG. My second time in, I had the same waiter, and he was just as rude as the first time. 
I'll be back for sure, but if he is working, I'm going to ask to be sat in a different section."}
{"text":"The service here is so unbelievably bad it's insane. No service for 15 minutes after being seated. Salads brought with no forks. Wings brought with no napkins. The food is awful. The service and wait staff are very incompetent. I'd no way at all recommend this place to anyone!! F--"}
{"text":"This is a cozy tucked away gem with a unique set up and yummy food. The birds are what makes this place unique as they surround the front entrance as well as a portion of the outdoor seating area. Don't come to place expecting quiet because these adorable birds have plenty to squawk about. The outdoor seating is nice and there is also a covered bar and upstairs patio/lounge area. The food we had was yummy but unfortunately our service was mediocre."}
{"text":"Went on Friday night last week and had a horrible experience. We arrived and checked in with the hostess,  4 adults and a baby (3 months to be exact) she asked if we wanted inside, outside, or first available. We opted for first available and we were told 45min to an hour. After an hour and 10 minutes we get taken to our table, IN THE SMOKING SECTION. 

Obviously we asked to be moved as the people next to us were smoking and that's not something we want to expose our 3 month old too. Was the staff understanding? NO

We were told we could A) get our name put back on the list, which would mean another 45min wait,  or B) we could sit at another table in the smoking section further away from anyone currently smoking, but with no guarantee that someone wouldn't come smoke next to us. 

Since when did it become acceptable to assume that a child should be exposed to second hand smoke?! When asking inside, outside, or first available, you really need to ask if we wanted smoking or non smoking. Better yet,  never assume a child should be exposed to second hand smoke unless the parents request it. 

The Perch has not only lost my business but my friends family and anyone who will listen. Simply appalling."}
{"text":"The scenery/ambiance is the purpose of going here. The food and service is average. I prefer happy hour to sitting down to the expensive dinner."}
{"text":"This place has a very nice atmosphere and is without a doubt my favorite new place in Chandler. That being said it doesn't come without its issues. 

The things I really like about this place is the garage turned into a bar retrofit, it is pretty sweet. I like the red brick walls, they add character to the place.  The birds, Apparently they are rescued birds. That's pretty cool. They have a nice variety of beers. The upstairs outside area with it's musician playing music is nice.

Things that can be improved are the restroom situation. It is quite a large area for one male and one female restroom. There is one sink just outside the women's restroom for both male and females to use. the paper towels you use eventually get wet and if your a germaphobe can be quite nasty.     

For a Saturday, they didn't appear to be properly staffed. Our poor server was working so many tables and several drinks sat at the bar getting warm. Again, not her fault she was doing all she could to stay on top of things.

And, one other thing that I saw that really bothered me was to see a patron harassing a bird. There should be a sign stating that if you harass the birds you are banned from this place permanently!  The last thing a rescued bird should have to deal with is a drunken person messing with them. 

Even with all that I am willing to give this place a chance and will continue to come back. I hope they work on these issues. This place has the potential to be a very amazing local spot."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with some friends to enjoy the nice weather and have a couple brews. Parking is close by in a dirt lot with just a quick walk over to the front. Friendly staff and one of the owners greeted us right away as we went upstairs. A nice crowd of people were there, enjoying their drinks with friends. The bar upstairs was slammed so drinks took about 10 minutes to get. I started with a San Tan Hefe, which was cold and delicious. I was with a big group and were able to sit on the nice couches and then moved to an area with smaller tables to nibble on appetizers. The food choices are different but did enjoy what we ordered. Our group had the chips and salsa, which came with 3 different dips. We also ordered the cheese platter and the hummus. The hummus does have a kick, which I wasn't expecting, so I stuck with just eating the veggies. Cheese platter was delicious, especially with a nice cold beer. Chips and dip were good too. 

Servers were around to take orders, which made getting drinks and food easy. They do have angry orchard, which I ordered next. The view, weather and vibe of the Perch was really awesome and my favorite part. It is so relaxing to drink, hang out and just enjoy other people's company. I talked with many new people that night, including the owners. James came over to personally thank us for coming and asked if he could get us anything. Personally, I think that is awesome and makes me want to come back even more. Oh, and the women's bathroom is decorated really cute, nice touch!

Yes, this place is new and does still have kinks to work out. It's truly a unique spot and I really had a great time. I can't wait to come back and enjoy, whether it's with a group of friends or on a date with my boyfriend.

Great job James, keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Great Tatar tots. Great beers. Nice service. Only downfall I found was the upstair patio seating was really dirty with hair, old food, stains."}
{"text":"Great find in chandler unique setting great for kids the burger was very good service excellent a good selection of beers a fun place everyone in our party enjoyed it"}
{"text":"Came on a sunday we had actually checked in at yolis next door but this place had no wait so we jumped on that opportunity. Thinking sunday theybwould have a brunch like most downtown places have just to be told breakfast ends at 11. Prices are extremely high for lunch 12 for a burger 6 for kids meals and the wait forbthe food was over 45 min. You may be able to get in quick but then you wait for your food"}
{"text":"This might just be my new favorite spot in the East Valley. The ambiance is incredible!! The birds are amazing to see and so beautiful, but the food, beers, and awesome atmosphere really did it for me. Thursday Jazz night was so bomb!! I had 3 Perch beers on happy hour (yes 3) and they were all so delicious. I highly recommend the Belgian Peach - not too fruity, really hearty, so good! Definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks, not food and it was a very unique atmosphere. I liked the environment and I would think about going here for dinner in the future.

UPDATE: Food is awful, service is horrible and has some other issues too that I won't even begin to address on Yelp. I think the environment is cool, yes... but the food and service are a thumbs down!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, great beer, truly amazing atmosphere!

With three distinct looks and feel to the place, there is something here for everyone. Start with the aviary/courtyard, then move indoors to the tavern or upstairs to the rooftop. Either way, you're going to have a good time here.

As pub food goes, this is some of the best I've had. The bruschetta is to die for. Pick 3, any 3, you won't be disappointed. Trust me. I saw the burgers and thought, \"someone's been to Slaters 50/50\" but these were unique and delicious! I liked the bacon poutine tots but I'd love to see them attempt a REAL poutine with dark brown gravy and curds. Hell, they can pour that on the tots too because those were perfectly done. Soft in the center but not mushy and crispy on the outside. I saw the brussel sprouts and pork belly pizza and I'll have to get that on my next stop in.

Service was stellar, prices were beyond reasonable, and the place was CLEAN. I can't say that about many pubs...anywhere.

But I came here for the beers and The Perch has some of the best choices in Arizona. They've gone totally non-traditional with a rosemary IPA, Ginger Mofo, Cinnamon Honey Nut Porter, grilled lemon cream ale, and a calibration English mild. All below 7.1% abv, these beers will keep you cool all summer long and keep you drinking all night but mostly because you just can't stop drinking them! 

My mouth knows no friendship. If this wasn't a great place to have a meal or beer, I would most likely be cordial and keep my mouth shut. Yet, here I am and I can't keep my facehole quiet about The Perch. If I lived here, it would be my regular hang out spot year round."}
{"text":"Horrible service...I had to break up with the Perch once and for all. 
I'm so upset that I'm forced to ban a place in my area. I have been a customer since the Perch opened. I made excuses because the place was new, the food was still being worked out, they changed up the patio, etc.  But now I just have to be honest...they have managed to hire the worst servers that have ever existed in the service industry. 
Last straw: Saturday night (no excuses, places that want to be a hot spot on a Sat night should be prepared for it)...had family in town we sat upstairs. Took exactly 23 minutes to get service but only after we asked a girl running by us....we order drinks, food....both overpriced but good service can mitigate that.  
Took 17 minutes to get the check...I felt like I was being held hostage. I wouldn't be shocked if they have a high volume of people who skip on their tab. 
Never going back again.  Way too much competition for this level of insult toward customers."}
{"text":"Brought my parents here to eat and left embarrassed. The hostess sent us upstairs, when there were SEVERAL open tables that were on a \"wait\". However there was no one waiting. The other hostess explained there were only three servers on and they couldn't fill up the tables; why are there only three servers on at 7pm on a Friday? The person working upstairs sent us to the downstairs bar, the people workers at the downstairs bar sent us back to the hostess. EVERYBODY we encountered tonight was rude and unwelcoming. The ambiance is unique but the dismissive behavior the staff embodies is disgraceful.  We ended up eating at Charm Thai Cuisine and it was delightful. Everyone was kind and the food was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"The service was great, food was amazing, I got the Perch Burger (huge, took half home) wife got a strawberry salad, I also got some kind of raspberry beer, pretty tasty.
We own some parrots so we enjoyed seeing all of the birds, Scarlet Macaw, Blue & Gold Macaw, Cockatoo, Sun Conure and a ton of all types of Amazons, double yellow heads, single yellow head, blue Napes, etc, etc.....
Pretty cool place, will return periodically, as it was $50 for what we had it won't be very often, that's upper end for us (besides Ruth's Chris)
The patio was OK, they could use a professional architect to come in and make the atmosphere more appealing, but it was OK. The restrooms are interesting, access from the outside, they look like outhouses, but when you walk in they are plumbed and air conditioned, but could use a thorough cleaning, smelled a little....
Those were the only reasons they didn't get 5 stars.....
Definitely worth a visit, go check it out."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could. I went on a Saturday night and sat at the bar upstairs with a friend to check out this horrible place because her boyfriend wanted to have his birthday party here!  It wasn't busy at all surprisingly. We were told that the kitchen was closing in a few minutes so to order food if we wanted any. We ordered two shots of tequila, water and the mac & cheese w/bacon. First the bartender tried to tell us the only tequila they sold was silver Patron when we ordered gold cuervo (yeah my friend loves the cheap stuff). Finally he said they had hornitos and poured us two shots. My friend asked for limes, he handed her one, rolled his eyes and said \"is there anything ELSE I can do for you?\" Trying to joke with him thinking he was possibly having a bad night I told him she was a bartender too and he proceeded to tell us how they were the WORST when it came to service. Pretty nice right?
So we still haven't touched our shots. Servers are just standing there chatting, I ask for another lime and salt. I just get a lime. My friend asks our original bartender for water. About five minutes later we get one glass of water, not two. Then finally get salt. About 10/15/minutes after arriving we take our shots?? Absolutely ridiculous.
Our food comes out. That's one thing I can say was delicious, the food. However while we were eating a server dropped all of her dishes and instead of just ignoring it she screamed out loud how she couldn't wait to get drunk when she got off in 30 minutes and how proud she was she didn't break any (even though she broke about half of them)
Overall it was an awful experience and we will never go back. Not only did this restaurant lose my business but they lost the revenue of an entire birthday party. I've also told everyone I know about my experience and most of the people I know go to Downtown Chandler now so they will be going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very interesting place. Think oversized backyard dinner. Be ready for a wait as everytime we went was around an hour for 2 people. Staff was friendly and food was good. Neat to see the rescued birds throughout. The top deck is more party scene with bar and crowds. I guess a place locals come to hang out."}
{"text":"Perch is a great place to try their many craft beers. Always have a wide selection to choose from and the atmosphere is really cool. The food pretty good with good happy hour prices. Love the tots."}
{"text":"Interesting place in downtown Chandler. Food and service was good."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and I love the theme of a rescued-bird sanctuary. Our bartender Ife was great, giving lots of (good) recommendations for local breweries. The food was yummy, though not as many true vegetarian items as I would have expected from an owner who is herself a vegetarian. (Please, no chicken broth in the beer cheese!) Still, I have to give them 5 stars for their own brews being creative and tasty (Rosemary IPA- wow!), their additional tap selection, the good food, great theme, and excellent service. We visited 6 breweries around Phoenix and 4 tap houses to try as many Arizona beers as we could, and the Perch Pub was definitely a highlight."}
{"text":"When judging this Brewery against other breweries, the Perch really stands out. The atmosphere is incredible. The closest brewery to be able to capture the same atmosphere as The Perch is Stone Brewery Liberty Station San Diego. The Perch beer is good but where they pull ahead is their food. I guarantee you will not find better food at any brewery in America. Add their food to their atmosphere and a crisp fresh brewed beer and you will see this place is top-notch."}
{"text":"Just ate at the perch  for the first time . My husband had a burger which was good I had the shrimp citrus salad and it was not very good. The service was very slow I'll give this place one more chance maybe."}
{"text":"Please drop your 1/2 glass of Strawberry beer from $7 down to a reasonable price, then I'll be back. Seriously, I got a glass of brrr cut in half. Embarrassed by my sippy cup of beer.  Delicious, though. 4 for ambiance, location and hours."}
{"text":"Here's another hidden gem in Downtown Chandler (DC) that is on my list of top places in the area!!!  I kept seeing the advertisements for this place but for some reason I kept thinking it was just a bar or beer place.  Man was I wrong and very surprised.

Now I will be honest and say that we stopped at another place DC and it was way too expensive for brunch and decided to give this place a shot.  I remember that this area used to have a couple of salons and other shops before and now it is an exotic spread with birds, trees, a garden, and great ambiance.  The weather was perfect to sit outside on a Sunday morning for brunch with the football games on.  There was seating inside and outside but you can get a feel for everything by sitting outside.

Our server was Dustin and he did a great job giving us the scoop on the menu and specials for the day.  The words four dollar mimosas came out of his mouth and I was game.  You know how some places are stingy with the mimosas and it comes out in these tiny little glasses?  Not this place because one lasted me the whole brunch and it was really good.

The brunch menu had breakfast burritos, baked tamales with chorizo, and french toast.  Now the cool part is that the dishes are made in cast iron skillets in an oven.  I decided to go with the french toast since the tamale has a little kick for those that like that.  My french toast came with eggs and tater tots with onions and peppers.  Saying that it was good would be an understatement.  It was so friggin good!!  It was good and I blamed one of the birds.    Many people were getting wings, burgers, hot dogs, etc so those are available as well.  

Make a point of walking around the grounds to see the 50 exotic birds and just how beautiful the scenery is.  I will need to make a point of going back at night to see the band that plays on the roof top at night for a girl's night out or with the fella."}
{"text":"I love their Mac and cheese. The happy hour mini size is enough for one person as a meal by itself !"}
{"text":"I really enjoy finding places that have have great food, service and awesome ambiance. 
Dropped in after a meeting for a quick snack the pork green chili was off the chart! The Happy Hour portions was quite big enough for two people to share. The tortillas that came with the pork happen to be so tasty (just like Grandma use to make) gobbled that up with a very nice peach beer.  The birds do get a little loud so if your having a business meeting maybe sit a little away from the large avery . 
The beautiful trees helps make this place a gem. Ashley was was super sweet and checked in on us several times. Oh yes they have a rooftop bar that is very cool and trendy spot! (It's for 21 and older) i know this will be my meet up spot when i am in Chandler."}
{"text":"Always been a fan of this place but I just walked out after waiting 40 minutes for a drink upstairs. Server just looked at me and kept moving to busier spots. After 20 minutes and multiple passes, I gave up. 

Lesson learned. Don't come here if you're a single."}
{"text":"Chips is inedible. I'm sure management can do better. I was told by my table mate to shut up but I like this place and totally believe in customers feedback. Please make better chips. Step by step you'll earn \"wows\" from customers."}
{"text":"hidden garden, We have been going to the shops on wall street for several years, remember better than sex cakes?  The Perch is a great addition, to the downtown area. food is good,, BEER is great,  We take our out of town friends here for lunch,  not in summer though, the only negative is the staff sometimes is not attentive to outside dinning in summer, that's why 3 stars, other months I have never had problem."}
{"text":"I've been to two parties here recently. I love the atmosphere.  Both times the wait staff knew what they were doing.  The beer list changes often but if you can even partially convey what you like you will find a beer that fits your taste being served to you.  

I am somewhat less impressed with the food offerings. Good thing I went twice.  On my first visit I had the house burger and shared an order of garlic, herb and goat cheese tots.  Was not that impressed, especially at that price point.  If I was writing this review only on my first visit it would have been a 3.  On my second visit I shared a Spinach and Artichoke Grilled Cheese and a Green Chile Porker.  Both were much more imaginative and flavorful than the burger."}
{"text":"I have been here many time but when your bartender is spending more time trying to get into a woman's pants at 3 in the afternoon instead of waiting on customers, I have a problem. I HATE BAD SERVICE!!"}

{"text":"Went back to the Perch for another friend's celebration and I have to tell you I was thrilled because everything I had last time was delish so I pretty excited to try something new.

Once again, this place is a hidden gem for Chandler, just has a cool vibe about it, for me the ambience is still pretty sweet, how can you not like the birds, the wooden checker game, the roof top bar,  just a cool place over all.

Last time I was there I had the green chili pork pizza and was blown away with how good the green chili was, spicy and perfect so this time I ordered the Green Chili Porker, and man I had high hopes, its braised carnitas, roasted green chilis, pepperjack cheese, black forest ham, applewood smoked bacon, red pepper aioli, fried egg on top of a homemade bun. The bun had a great texture and can easily hold this sandwich together without ripping or being too hard, and the black forest ham stood out in flavor, everything else was just bland, even the green chili pork was bland, there was no heat, no spice, no flavor, just textures, even the egg was over fried, I definitely did not order the best dish that night, just was under wowed by it.  Asked for some sriracha to liven it up.  

I still think The Perch is a pretty cool spot, but maybe I'll just stick with the fried green sliders and green chili pork pizza."}
{"text":"Thanks to all the positive reviews posted on Yelp, we decided to give it a try.   I was visiting town on business and looking for a casual place to enjoy outside seating and have some good food and cold beer.  The Perch was great.  Friendly service, good selection of beer and enjoyed the Food.  i will definitely return on my next visit to Chandler.  I recommend sitting by upstairs bar-plenty of tables and seats all around."}
{"text":"First time coming here and me and my boyfriend absolutely loved it! The atmosphere is positively beautiful and despite what other reviews said we had excellent service! Granted we didn't have the food but the beer is lovely and I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Chill spot... Dig the lunch and dinner crowds better than bar... Really great atmosphere and eats"}
{"text":"I have never had such bad service in my entire life. The hostesses were completely incompetent and we waited for a table for over an hour. When we asked how much longer we were told that she had no idea. Oh, and the kitchen was closing soon so your party may not even get to eat! We walked out and noticed a party leaving and WE were the ones to ask if the table could be cleaned and if we could sit there.  We were seated but our food too another hour to come. Just in time for the kitchen to close. Good thing for them because the food was basically shit and since the kitchen is now closed, nothing could be done. 

I had such high expectations for this place and we were very dissapointed."}
{"text":"Very nice and comfortable area.  Food was very good.  Lunch specials are $12 and extremely filling.  The grilled cheese is a combination of spinach artichoke dip cheddar cheese, bacon and fried green tomato.  Their beer selection is very complete.  Mas Macho has a nice light flavor.  Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Fresh to the AZ area, my friend took me to The Perch for some live music, brews and food. What a DELIGHT! As you enter, the ground floor is huge with dining tables, fancy exotic birds and an enclosed bar area. The atmosphere is friendly and quite eclectic. Upstairs offers an open, casual rooftop lounge with bar seating, cocktail high-top tables and couches for larger parties and couples alike. Our server was friendly and attentive and even jumped on the mic at one point to jam on the guitar and sing a few tunes- exceptional! He offered great recommendations for shareable dishes and beers. I enjoyed myself here and have been back multiple times since. Affordable and delicious with an ever-evolving beer list and menu under the stars!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, perfect aumbiance and friendly wait staff.  The food arrived quick and my husband and I were pleasantly surprised by the portion size.  Even in 110 evening temp, the outdoor seating was comfortable.  Listening to the birds made me feel like I was on a tropical island."}
{"text":"Pricy, but a nice atmosphere. The burgers are very good ($17!). 

Service was excellent, even on a busy weekend. 

The birds are not right on top of you (that was my worry before visiting). 

Definitely a place worth going back to!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty cool. They have birds downstairs in cages and upstairs is a beautiful view.

It is hard to find. Look between the other buildings when your GOS tells you that you have arrived."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere with the myriad birds. The upstairs area is equally charming, though there are not birds. I had the cider and brunch tacos, and both were terrific. The staff is lovely and friendly. Time does not exist here. We've been here 2 hours already and are nowhere near ready to leave. There is music, which is lively but not too loud, so you can talk. Fantastic place to spend a casual bit of time."}
{"text":"I come here for the beer/wine and mostly the burgers.  If we aren't up for driving...we come here for burgers.  They have such an awesome smoked flavor to their burgers (dont forget to ask for their homemade bbq sauce to dip it in!)  I have tried their shrimp salad as well and the shrimp had that gross fishy taste I am not a fan of but hey I gave some of their menu a chance and the only thing worth getting at this point besides the drink are the burgers and the wings. Enough said.  Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch. Outside looks like Compton, like u gonna get shot by a drive by. Going inside was totally cool. I like the birds. Other reviewers complained. I do agree that staff seems like its their first jobs. Bartender Tim doesnt smile. I ordered a draft beer and he gave it to me in a glass ypu'd get a scotch in. He said its their policy due to the alcohol level. This totally annoyed me! Bars downtown put all beer in pint glasses. Had the smoked burger. It was really good. Tater tots were under cooked though. Overall not a bad place. Cool atmosphere but staff need to b trained better. I will go back again"}
{"text":"My bad apparently for going on a Sunday!  while we enjoyed the unique atmosphere and the selection of house brews, waiting over 45 minutes for food was a dealbreaker.  Worse was that a supervisor came by and asked if we needed anything else. she said she would check on our food and never came back! We gave up and left without ever eating!   We love to roam the State and visit Arizona Craft Beer Guild members but what an AWFUL first impression The Perch made."}
{"text":"What a unique spot! They just underwent some renovations and redid their entire menu (can't go wrong with anything on it.) They have a very large selection of beers that they brew on site, I highly reccommend doing a flight so you can give a few a try. There is a beautiful courtyard area, as well as a rooftop bar and indoor bar. Live music on the weekends is always fun, get in before it gets to be too chilly out!!"}
{"text":"I made the mistake of bringing 17 of my friends here for a birthday celebration.  The side room for events used to be so cute with couches and tables in a warm environment for socializing.  Now it is a room of tables and chairs for 4 or less per table... it echos and has the feel of an after thought... mind you there is a charge to even use this room... so, we took the party to the patio where we were moving round tables into a line so that we might get to talk to one another. It was a chilly night... we had 2 heaters for 17 people.  We had a server who was slow getting around due to a broken foot in a walking boot (not her fault, but perhaps her boss should have recognized this and had her stationed nearer to the kitchen).  The first two choices of beer on tap were out... the salmon salad appeared to be constructed with salmon as a seasoning though it is listed as the top ingredient, followed by mixed greens which was the bulk of it.  Two ordered the prime rib sandwich and both complained that the bread was completely mushy.  The tater tots did not come with the jalapeño marmalade as ordered... out of that too... 

A huge disappointment... with soooo many choices, The Perch was nothing to crow about."}
{"text":"As soon as we sat down there was nice cold ice water served. We ordered recommended wines and beer. The food was incredibly Good."}
{"text":"The location is hard to find, but there are a lot of trees that have shade.  When I was inside, the first thing I saw was a bunch of birds in cages.  All the birds have names.  One of the birds have a name called Rush Limbered.  A lot of them are parakeets.  The parakeets have really cool names."}
{"text":"Went today for Mother's Day Breakfast, mom's pick. Had a reservation for 5 adults 2 kids at 0930. Atmosphere is very cute, the birds are fun to look at. Although, they can get quite loud and it's hard to hold a conversation. But that's the whole idea of the place, the birds!!! I get it. About 10 choices on the breakfast menu, and you can't order off of the main menu until 11, which I can understand. It was quite busy, which is expected. Apparently 0930 is when a big rush of parties were seated, after our order was taken our server came over to announce that the ticket times were running at about 30 minutes since everyone's order was put in at once. No big deal! Coffee was delicious and strong, $0.10 mimosas for mothers day, birds chirping........ An hour later, still no food. At this point I notice how a table of 4 which got sat after we had put our food order in got their food before us, and were about half way through eating before we even got our food. Every food item was cold. At this point I just wanted to be done, worked the night before I just wanted to go home, and I didn't want to wait another hour for more food. I expect this at Denny's when you're paying $3.99 for a Grand Slam or whatever, but when you are paying $12-$14 per entree, I want it to be hot! After reading all of the other reviews, I'm not so sure I'm in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"My friend loves this place so I thought I would give it a try. We parked in the dirt lot across the street and walked over. The restaurant looks really awesome from the outside! All of the trees and birds, it was impressive! Our party of 4 came around 7pm so it was fairly busy and we knew we would wait. Almost 45 minutes later and after seeing multiple tables clean and open for over 15 min was annoying when we we hungry! Once seated, our server seemed way too busy and when I asked him about the beers he didn't spend more than a minute just rattling them off the menu (I can do that). I asked for a description of one and he said he something along the lines of \"it's like any other IPA\".... But what is an IPA was my question. :-/ I got the burger and it was way too pink and COLD but I didn't want to complain I was so hungry at this point. He came back to see how everything was but was always running. I feel like we were an inconvenience if anything. The patio was really cool and would've been even better if people didn't let their kids run around like it was a zoo. The staff could've done something here... Overall this place could have great potential but didn't leave a good first impression with me. Maybe I will try the rooftop bar and give them one more chance!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this place and immediately fell in love! I enjoyed the Perch Sundress IPA and snacked on the fried pickles and peppers. Sat at the bar and the bartender was awesome. The place has an amazing atmosphere and delicious beer! If you're ever visiting Chandler check this place out!"}
{"text":"Bella was amazing and she not only continued to serve us quickly but also was kind enough to offer her input on what's best and what we should order. Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times but will never be back.  I do like most of the food but it's pretty generic pub fare, only saving grace is craft beers .
I will not be back because last night 9/19/15 I was there at 7:23pm and was told 45 minutes for a table for 4, was told at 7:48 my table was ready, well they messed up and thought there were only 2 of us. No big deal, we were told wait 5 minutes. 20 minutes later without an update, I asked how much longer until our table was ready, I was told \" you were told it would be 45 minutes and you're right there so you'll have to wait\". Girl in glasses and flannel shirt was so rude! We left and went to DC Steak House. They were fabulous to us, food was great (@DC) I highly recommend them instead of the terrible customer service at the perch!"}
{"text":"We REALLY wanted to like this place, but....

Pro's: awesome location in alley in downtown Chandler...great decor...rooftop bar...friendly service

Con's:
- Food...the bruschetta was so bad we could only get through one bite of each kind and had to force that down...it's such an easy thing to make too....tomato part of garlic one was bitter, bread tasted old and wasn't toasted, etc...terrible.
- Signature drinks were so bad we left them.  Sweet Manhattan? No! Vintage 95 Manhattan is incredible....they take fresh orange peel, light it on fire and rub the rim...yummy.

If they get a new cook and bartender, we will return...until then, we will go to Vintage 95 -- awesome."}
{"text":"Advertised hours until 12:30 am seven days a week. Four of us walk in and the bartender says \"We closed at 11\". I tell him it would be nice if the advertised hours say that. I've only been in the business 20 years\" He proceeds to say \"I'll be sure to let the owners know that\" Attitude will get you nowhere in this industry. I don't know care how \"new\" the business is, you should know Hospitality Basics 101."}
{"text":"New visit.  Sat inside.  Had luncheon special.   Food was fantastic and server was attentive,  respectful  and fun.  Will come back and definitely recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"The food and beer have gone way downhill. None of our meals were good and the beer was mediocre. There was only one guy working the whole indoor area and it was packed on Saturday. We will not be back, which is too bad since we loved it last year."}
{"text":"Love this place! GREAT food, great beers on tap and love seeing all the birds! Very unique setup for a restaurant but it's fabulous!"}
{"text":"Foods was good, service was ok.  Our waitress wasn't too attentive, our drinks were not offered a refill until she brought our check.  They food was ok, we each had different burgers, good flavor, but my burger (Perch burger) was a bit too sweet.  We sat at the table closest to the bathroom, had to share it with another couple.  There was a huge puddle of water on the floor where I was sitting seeping in from outside."}
{"text":"We went last night because my husband loves the burgers. I wanted to get the meat and cheese tray and it was $25. So we got that and drinks. We constantly had to wave down our waitress and seek her out to order an additional dish because the tray was awful. It had all hard cheeses, some fruit, celery and carrots but nothing to put on them or dip or spread. Our two pieces of bread were cold and hard. The wait staff never came back to check how it was and she looked busy and frazzled.  At the end someone cleaning tables dropped a drink and kept walking and it got in my bag and shoes. When she came to clean it she looked very unhappy and annoyed so I said nothing and she didn't ask. I love the birds and the burgers but I spent to much money and left hungry, thirsty, had sticky shoes and mad I put my bag on the ground."}
{"text":"Super cute little tucked away bar. Love the concept of all the exotic birds! Definitely a great patio bar with can't lie cruise to protect you from the birds. Was a little on the expensive side. No appetizers under $10. Maybe they do have a better happy hour."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere,  we had two diferente servers. The first lady was rushing, did not take the order accurately and did not seem to want to be there. When she left, Jake took over and the experience changed considerably.
He was friendly and efficient. 
The food was tasty, although the menu could have more options.
Parking can be an issue,  so arrive early."}
{"text":"I was really dissapointed. the wait on a Saturday afternoon  (without a downtown Chandler festival) was over an hour. The service was incredibly slow (another hour) AND my burger was made well done despite the waitress asking me how I wanted it made and my saying medium rare. Add to that they only took $3.75 off the  $15 burger. Not happy and the burger was just so so. Cute ambiance but no thanks."}
{"text":"You cant beat the patio, it is a little oasis in the desert. I'd stick to cooler months though. The french dip was great and they have outdoor games that can be played. Our 6 year old played a big jenga and cornhole with some college students and had a blast :)"}
{"text":"What a great brewery, very cool vibe, the birds, the brew, bartenders, balcony roof top & their Beer Sponge....Bravo!

It's a funky little establishment and every neighborhood needs a place like this tuck away on a side street/alley way to escape to.  We came for the brews and they had a nice selection.   At the time they had 6 of their own selections and the IPA was the favorite.  They also had a great selection of microbrews from other fabulous brewery locations on tab.  We order a beer sponge \"pretzel\" with their homemade beer cheese sauce....CHIRP=awesome!     The staff was awesome too...very friendly & attentive and they all know their beers.  We had a great experience here...can't wait to bring friends here and enjoy the roof top when the weather is cooler.  

The more peeps that know about how this place, will flock here."}
{"text":"Really cool bar!  Birds all over in cages and overgrown vegetation, awesome atmosphere.  The rooftop bar is pretty cool and they have some great local beers to try at a decent price.  Food on the other hand stinks.  We had the mushroom burger and shrimp salad.  The burger was obviously a frozen pre-shaped patty that was way over cooked, and tasteless.  My wife's salad was half wilted and the shrimp was very fishy.  We did see people who had meat and cheese boards and those looked pretty good.  Bottom line great, original bar, I would come back for drinks! I'll eat before I get there though."}
{"text":"Ok. I really want to like this place. The atmosphere is gorgeous. And I keep going back because hubby digs the happy hour - a great deal with $5 pizza and discounted beer. I've been here I think 5 times already at least. But the slow service and poor management/operations keep me from being a fan. 

With the exception of the green chili pork pizza, the food isn't that great either. Actually, I've had the strawberry salad which was good, but overpriced for the portion size. The margarita pizza was terrible. They use pesto sauce and not fresh basil and it was soggy. Not a fan of the bruschetta (weird combo of flavors that don't work). 

And my last visit, I ordered a burger wrapped in lettuce. They don't have lettuce, just salad greens. So my burger comes out totally cold, on top of a bed of wilted spring mix. Not appetizing at all! So I sent it back and told the server it was cold. He brings it back, and it's burned to a crisp!  I was like seriously? Why would you even serve that to me? I sent it back again and just requested they take it off the bill. Which they did without any hassle.

The pizza takes for.ev.er.  I've been meaning to ask the owner if they only have one small pizza oven back there because the wait time is unreasonable. Like 40 mins for a small pizza has been the consistent wait time. It's frustrating. 

I really hope they can turn things around. I have a relative in the restaurant biz and understand it's exceedingly difficult, especially when you have owners new to the industry. So I try to be patient with new places (hence me not writing this review until after I've been 5+ times). But at this point, they should have things running a little more smoothly and they are not improving. 

2 stars for atmosphere and for service and management always being gracious and willing to fix their screw ups (which happen a lot)."}
{"text":"Awesome environment. we went during soft opening and staff was friendly and personable.  Brewery was not yet up to production due to delays in inspections, but they had a good selection of Kraft beers from other places and we took home two growlers of it..  Great atmosphere, especially upstairs at night. enjoyed the Aviary and bird cages. can't wait to go back and try the food!!"}
{"text":"Good beer selection and happy hour. Always go with the two topping $5 pizza. Fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"This concept is gold.
Seriously. I am in love with the idea. Birds everywhere and you get to sit outside. The decor and design of the place is ridiculously unique and interesting. To top it off the food was really good.

What I did not love, however, is how insanely hot it is inside by the bar. 

Hostess asked me, \"inside or out?\" I told her I didn't have a preference, but on a day that is 120 degrees, inside usually seems like the more intellectual choice. But it was not. Actually, it probably would have been better outside, because there are misters.

But, alas, I know that I live in a desert-wasteland that we call Arizona, so I cannot base my whole review on this one negative thing.

We started out with the pretzel, which was sooooo good, and some tots (the goat cheese ones) which were equally as impressive. 

I ordered the spinach artichoke dip grilled cheese. Omg. Two of my favorite things in the world combined. Yuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmm. My tastebuds were like, \"excuse us while we die and go to heaven\".

I will say, though, the drink I ordered was not my favorite. It was an old fashioned cream soda made with maker's mark, and garnished with an orange. When I squeezed the orange into the drink it made it a billion times better. 

My experience at The Perch was good and I will be back, but I'll probably wait until winter."}
{"text":"This place is adorable! I went here for brunch with friends and we loved sitting outside with the trees and birds. The food was affordable and delicious.  They stop serving breakfast at 11:00 on weekends, so come early if that's what you want!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner and drinks here tonight (a Thursday). They've been open about 2 weeks and the menus still say \"soft opening\" which is totally understandable. The beer list is fantastic - we were a little disappointed that they don't have any house brews available yet, but again, understandable. We enjoyed the beers we got (including the beer I had from Huss, a local brewery that I was trying for the first time). The owner came by a couple of times to make sure that we were enjoying ourselves and that everything was fine, a touch that was very much appreciated. We had some service issues (we're pretty sure the waitress forgot to put in our food order, and we waited an hour for it). They more than made up for it when the bill came - it's one thing to make mistakes and have issues in a brand new restaurant, but it definitely makes things better when they are acknowledged and recognized.

We sat on the rooftop patio which is GORGEOUS. I know this place is going to be bursting at the seams soon enough. The food was tasty (the beer sausage plate and the fries on the side were especially notable). Definitely some room for improvement, but a ton of potential. We loved the birds, too! We were surprised (in a good way) at how many there were! The parrots were gorgeous. The place was less crowded than it probably would be on a weekend night, but we didn't see anyone sitting anywhere close to the birds. There didn't appear to be any sanitation issues with the birds, so I'm not sure where some of the other reviewers were coming from with that."}
{"text":"Loved the set up..drinks. .and staff were friendly. .but the bald manager with the moon boot on ..totally had some kind of attitude. .even our waitress said he was a jerk..
Other then that I would go back amd totally avoid this dick..prices are decent. .I only had appetizers they were ok.."}
{"text":"I am sorry to only give 2 stars, but that is a stretch. We went twice this summer and it would have been 4 or 5. However our recent visit was very disappointing. The menu has been greatly reduced and the happy hour menu is very restricted to minimal items. Example... the pretzel was out standing the first 2 visits and reasonably priced. Now it is no longer available alone. You have to get it with out items (I think pickles) and at almost $10. When we asked if we could just get our son the pretzel they said that it is now on the menu alone. 

The atmosphere is nice but there are limited tables inside with TV viewing. WE have not been on the roof, but the outdoor seating is nice but not sport watching."}
{"text":"Great place first time and grabbed a flight will be back for the food! Bird bath is my favorite."}
{"text":"They revamped the menu again! They took away our favorite green chili pork pizza and the prices are so much higher. $18 for a pizza $15-18 for a hamburger. We decided on pretzels with beer cheese and two beers. The beer cheese is cold shredded cheese in a cold mayo sauce....what? When I asked if it was supposed to be cold, the waitress just said yes the whole menu is new. Who wants cold beer cheese dip with soft pretzels? Not us apparently. We probably won't be back for food, which is frustrating since it was one of our favorite winter spots in Chandler."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. I did! First, the place is absolutely adorable with the birds, great outdoor seating, rooftop and the indoor seating. Definitely aesthetically pleasing. Beer selection is pretty good. However, the food is awful and over priced. We ordered pizza, tater tots and grilled cheese sandwich, and the quality was more like cafeteria food with the price of gastropub food. If this place were to change around the menu and quality of food, it would be bangin. Overall right now,this is a great place to hang out and have a drink, but I would probably save my appetite for elsewhere."}
{"text":"Over priced food. Their beer is great and the atmosphere is perfect.... We also got great service. If they ever either make better tasting food or lower their prices I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great beer great food great atmosphere and great servers, lived in the area for 1.5 years and just found this place, maybe my best find in the Phoenix area so far"}
{"text":"LOVE LoVE LOVE The Perch!  Very laid back atmosphere.  The patio has all kinds of exotic birds, shade trees and misters going to keep the patio feeling 20 degrees cooler than it was in the sweltering heat last Sunday!  Our waiter was very nice and helpful.  He recommended the Perch house made sour beer and it was so delicious that I left with a growler of it.  This was definitely worth the drive from South Phoenix.  Cant wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot in Chandler, the staff is welcoming and let you sample different beers. The food is good also, try the pizza for $5 during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and beer.
Such a great place ... This is one place you need to stop at if you're in Chandler.
The customer service is fantastic as well..  
Oh..  And the birds may bite..   Lol"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time at this exciting Brewery right behind Local the other night, did some exploring and this was a spot I've been hearing so much about.

The girl at the front desk was very sweet and accommodating, also we met the main manager who chatted my friend and I up about the place, and encouraged us to try the food and beers (of course!)

So we took a seat after admiring the giant Aviary that is included in the brewery!  What an idea!  Strange and different, but also very cool and animal friendly!

We tried the flight of brews and had some Hummus, which was delicious. Pretty pricey but very good. The flight had a few hits and a few misses, which is normal.

The big hit for me was the Blonde Brews that they have there, those were fantastic. So good in fact, the manager came over and said I had try all the blondes they brewed!  So she dropped off another one compliments of the house.

Great experience, definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The Perch is such a cool little area too bad the service is terrible. We had a table of four and our server was pretty bad. It seemed like every time we asked for drinks or a water refill (which we shouldn't have to do in 110 degree weather) she would get frustrated and annoyed. Isn't that how you are making your money?? Us ordering drinks/food?? When we asked for appetizers she acted like it we were wasting her time. We had a 250 dollar tab, I wouldn't be pissed at that if I was a server. Who knows, maybe she had a bad day. 
 
I ordered the fish and chips, my husband had the fish tacos, the couple that was with us ordered the mac and cheese and pizza. The pizza was definitely the best option. I got a little sick after I ate my fish and my husbands tacos were pretty bland. The appetizers/drinks are good so I recommend just going for that and hanging out enjoying the birds!"}
{"text":"So, after reading some other Yelp reviews, I apparently stumbled into some random house in the barrio complete with porta-potties and swarming attack birds.  Oh and also, Chandler sucks!  Haters goin' hate I guess...

But ANYWAY, that wasn't my experience...  I know they are still in soft opening stages, but I'm giving this place 5 stars.  Are they there yet, no, probably a 4 as they work stuff out.  Are they going to be, I think yes, and if they aren't I'll come back and change it.

First, as far as setting goes... I happen to like downtown Chandler, so I can't really complain that this place is IN downtown Chandler.  I think it is a nice addition to the other great places in the area.  The whole place is very open so It is a welcomed change from being inside all the time.  I like the option of hanging around in the court yard or going up to the roof.  Oh and there are birds.  Not just the rescued ones at the restaurant, which are all in cages, but also flying around outside... because nature is good like that.  The inside has that gastro pub feel I'd expect as well.  Also, yes, the restroom entrances are outside, but they are nice on the inside.  My experience was porta-potty free.  I'll  take the WIFI and accessibility to plugs around the bar too.  Do I want to enjoy a beer while getting some work done while hanging out in the courtyard again?... YUP!

The beer selection was nice.  Honestly that's really why I'd wanted to go here.  I  liked the wide variety of beers that were on tap.  Sours, Fruit beer, IPAs, etc...  Between that and the wine and martini offerings, it gives everyone a little something they can enjoy.  I can't wait to see what kind of beers they make once their own brewery gets going.  Oh I also like the Happy Hour specials and daily beer specials.  I hope they keep that going.

I was actually surprised by the food.  For a beer places I wasn't expecting much, but the eclectic menu has a lot of good stuff that goes well with the beers.  I tried a piece of 3 different pizzas on happy hour and they were all tasty.  The homemade sausage plate was amazing.  A bunch of different mustard to go along with it.  I'll be getting that again.  I know it is only a soft menu so far, but I'm liking what I see.  PLEASE don't listen to complainants about about the menu selections.  We have enough burger places, seriously.

Service.  It was fine by me.  I usually don't expect much from new places, but there were a bunch of staff around helping people out and getting trained.  Even one of the owners was coming around and asking everyone about their experience.  I get the sense that they are really making an effort to provide everyone with a good experience."}
{"text":"Not only is the food here absolutely phenomenal, but so is the entire experience. From the tropical birds that have expert care and enclosures to the roof top bar that overlooks the rest of the restaurant and gives off its own incredibly laid-back vibe despite the heavy foot traffic."}
{"text":"Loved it great atmosphere our server Katie was great!  Try the chocolate tortilla desert it's life changing..get extra ice cream"}
{"text":"Oh man, I can't believe I just barely made it to The Perch for the first time! My old man and I came in to celebrate my birthday with a little dinner and bird watching. All of my expectations were exceeded. This is sincerely one of the coolest restaurants I've ever been to.

It's kinda hard to locate, but thankfully there are sandwich board signs in the parking area directing you where to go. When all else fails, just follow the bird noises.

Walking in, it feels like you've entered a secret brewery in, the rainforest. There's indoor & outdoor seating, which we opted for outdoor; because, I wanted to get the whole experience. Both my better half, and I, were shocked at how cool we were at our table, considering the truck thermometer read 104° when we pulled into the lot. There are misters all around the outdoor area, none of which are directly above the tables, because that would be gross. The many trees act as natural ceiling in the courtyard, and of course, birds everywhere. 

One bird was the star of the show. Her(I assume it's a girl) name was Luna, which we joked was probably short for \"Lunatic\" since she was a spaz. I personally found her outbursts hilarious, but I could see how someone trying to have a serious conversation could grow annoyed by her squawking. If you're reading this and you want to come here to whisper sweet-nothings to your partner, request to be sat away from Lunatic.

The food we had was great. I got the chicken fingers and the cheese/bacon tots. Normally I'd try something a little less basic, but I'm 7 months pregnant, which has given me the pallet of a 6 year old. I enjoyed my meal, while my dude was also happy with his perfectly cooked burger, and his can of Bud Light. We almost went with a dessert, but I knew if we ate anymore we'd go from satisfied and full, to miserably full real quick. Maybe next time.

To sum things up, I 12/10 recommend you make a trip to The Perch. We smiled from the moment we walked in, until the moment we left; and, vowed to return soon as well as with our son when he makes his way into the world."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a fluke when in the area.  It was a busy Friday night, we were short on time, but the wait staff was incredibly accommodating.  We had the pork with green chili appetizer which was amazing.  My son had the duck bacon burger which was huge and tasty, and I had the pretzel and cheese (it's good to be Mom).  The cheese was incredible.  My husband had the French dip which was disappointing but decent.  We all agreed we would return again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to the Perch a few times before and have enjoyed the atmosphere, food and drinks. Those times we went were for dinner. This time, we went for brunch, because why not!!
We were seated outside, which we requested. The server brought us water, which took a little longer than normal. Took our drink, food and appetizer order. We received our first drinks in a reasonable amount of time. When we wanted the second round, my wife ordered her drink about 10 minutes before I ordered my second. I received mine before she received hers at which time, she had to remind our server of the drink, who thought someone else was going to get for her. 
Once our food came, my wife's blueberry pancakes were dry and and had barely any blueberries in it. The menu stated that they would be topped with blueberries. Not the case at all. The potatoes that were served along side both of our entrees were dry and tasteless. Salt, pepper and ketchup did not even help. 
For having multiple positive experiences, The Perch failed with brunch. 
At least the drinks and the tots were top notch."}
{"text":"I did not give a review of Perch last time I was there because they had only been open for about a week. I am always willing to give a place (especially a new one) the benefit of the doubt. But with this being the second time and almost two months later, I have to render a verdict.

Let me say I really (REALLY ) want to like this place. The location is great. The beer selection is very good, and the wine selection is interesting, although not overly extensive. And the food is also good. They have some kinks to work out in the finer points of some dishes, but overall the place lives up to its \"gastropub\" distinction. I would be inclined to give the food and drink menus a four star rating. But what is the one thing that makes the best food and drink taste bad?....the service. Service should get half a star at best. 

When I first sat down at the bar, it took almost five minutes before one of the two main bartenders acknowledged my presence, even though I was sitting right next to the service bar. The first beer came relatively quickly, but the woman next to me that sat down (and also owns a local restaurant) had to wait almost ten minutes just to get a glass of wine.

Apparently at this establishment it takes two  bartenders to deal with a half-full bar and a half-full restaurant. This was a Sunday afternoon, so we weren't dealing with the Friday/Saturday night rush. Two separate times I waited ten minutes before a bartender noticed my beer was gone. I wasn't just waiting to be noticed though... I tried to flag down a bartender three separate times and they looked right past me! I did manage to order some food (the poutine style tater tots) which was very good. But no one checked how I liked the food or asked if I wanted to order more food, even though I explicitly said I would order more later. 

These bartenders had to keep checking recipes to make margaritas. I mean, I know what it's like to be a new bartender, but come on! I'm not sure how these guys got hired to be bartenders but it wasn't for their speed or ability to mix cocktails - most of which went out without garnishes (remember, I was sitting next to the service bar).

Here's a few other things I jotted down in the moment:
1) One bartender left his sinus rinse bottle out on the bar. I understand it sucks when you are dealing with allergies, but that doesn't look great to the guests.
2) The only bartender that knew anything about service and making drinks only showed up every once in a while (busy elsewhere I assume).
3) I watched a bartender spill Knob Creek on his hand and all over the floor because he was haphazardly holding two glasses rather than setting them on the bar mats which were right in front if him.

If I could make one recommendation to this place it would be to focus on service for the foreseeable future. And teach your bartenders how to actually tend bar - make drinks and help customers in a timely fashion. As I said already, I want this place to be great and hope to come back in the future, but as it stands the food and drink offerings do not make up for the terrible service (at the bar at least).

One nice point was the guitarist playing in the courtyard. He played a nice selection of tunes and could be heard throughout the restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely adored this place! It's like a secret garden meets grandma's bird collection plus amazing craft beer. Trust me, those are all good qualities! This review is strictly for atmosphere, beers, and service. All were wonderful. I cannot wait to go back and try the tots, which I hear are amazing! The brunch menu also looks very delicious. Live music was happening when we were there late on a Saturday night and it was nice too. Bottom line. I'll be back and I sure hope it's soon!"}
{"text":"Beautiful setting with many different breeds of birds and craft beer. Food is overpriced. Love coming here but only for a couple of rounds of drinks."}
{"text":"This was a great choice for an impromptu dinner with my wife and daughter. The place looks great with a large outdoor area with lots of exotic, rescued birds and a smaller bar area inside. Very clean place. The staff was very friendly and the beer and food were great too. I had the shrimp and pasta, which was delicious. My wife had the open faced tamale. I was jealous. That was a delicious dish and I would suggest it to anyone."}
{"text":"What an interesting place! I'm a big fan of local craft beer, and the Perch always has some of my favorites. The majority of the seating is outdoors (in a bird sanctuary), but there is plenty of outdoor seating with misters and fans. For being a craft brewery, the food is actually pretty good too. Highly recommend the charcuterie board (which is massive) and the prime dip sandwich. Overall, really cool vibe, great beer, good food."}
{"text":"The Perch Pub and Brewery has officially become my favorite bar. The atmosphere is very welcoming and I love the open rooftop bar. Their brews are amazing. I suggest getting The Flight sampler to taste the different beers. I recommend the Perch Intro Pale Ale. Their food is delicious as well! Check it out"}
{"text":"Absolutely Fabulous!  Terrific patio with wonderful birds all around you.  
Always looking for different veggie options and their roasted asparagus and cauliflower on a bed of arugula drizzled with a nice balsamic was beyond good!  If you try a wrap be prepared take it home or share-its hugh!
Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Such a cute little hideaway , can't wait to come back and try the food!!! We stopped in while waiting for comedy show and sampled a few beers, every one they brew was awesome! we will definitely be back and I strongly suggest the Belgian peach - you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"really like this place, it has great food and will have their own beer soon. the birds and roof top bar are very entertaining as well. the only downside to this place is they allow smoking which is ridiculous people!!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here for my birthday yesterday. We both agreed on getting the meat and cheese plate. When it arrived you could see how old the cheese was and it had been left out. The bread was so old it turned to crumbs in my hand when I tried to tear a piece off in my hands because it was so old and dry. The manager was visibly upset at how old it looked. It was a big let down to the day. Needless to say we didn't get anything else."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is probably one of my favorite things about the perch! Finding out all of these parrots are actually apart of a bird rescue makes it that much better! The bar is two levels and upstairs has more of an upbeat vibe at night with leather lounge sofas and djs on the weekends and the  downstairs has more of a low key vibe it's perfect for brunch or night life! I personally love the ipa selection and their seasonals that are always changing ! I would have given it 5 stars but had one bad brunch run in where literally everything was cold but everyone has their off days and I still come back for drinks and dinner which has never failed to disappoint!"}
{"text":"A unique concept for Chandler, The Perch has intimate outdoor dining, craft brew bar, and rooftop bar, dining and party area.  Definitely has something for everyone and you can choose your own environment depending on mood.  Cheers to these guys for their unique take and for spicing up the DC night life."}
{"text":"Love the ambience and the food. Food arrived as expected. Though the tables were all full and the waiters were very busy, there was no delay in getting the food to the table. 
the waiters were very friendly and very nice place for large groups. People won't mind even if your group is very loud."}
{"text":"Breakfast menu had about 6 items and they were out of 2 of them. We waited over 30 minutes and when our food came out it wasn't even close to hot. The chorizo burrito was 75% onions. The service was underwhelming as well. Server never apologize for the delay or asked how the food was or if we needed anything else. The rest of the staff were huddled around the bar being loud and obnoxious complaining about who had more tables."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place !! We came for breakfast at 9 am on a Sunday only to find the place still closed .. Hmmm.. Around 9:10 they finally opened the doors. We get in and wait 10- 15 minutes for a drink, And over an hour for our food. The food was mediocre . My boyfriend and my aunt had a side of fried potatoes that were still raw and crunchy . There was plenty of staff yet the Service was non existent .. There were a total of 10 customers siting around us so they certainly weren't overwhelmingly busy. Man what a bummer !! I had high hopes for this place. Dishes and silverware were dirty. I ordered coffee that came with 2 creamers and dirty glass containing sugar packets .. Awesome! I gave up on a refill or God forbid more creamer since we didn't have a waiter ? We had a kid bring us a menu, different one take our order, a 3rd one bring our drinks , and so on and so on . Bottom line breakfast was Disorganized , disappointing and all over unsatisfactory."}
{"text":"Great food! Environment is very..unique. Pork chili sandwich was the bomb and my wife had the artichoke grilled cheese and said it was the BEST sandwich she had ever had!! Service was friendly and prompt and the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"I normally have a really great time at the perch this bar is fun and unique outside setting is so unique however tonight service was extremely poor repeatedly asking for items, incorrect food orders ,20 minutes for a sample of beer in another 30 to get beer we all got there just before 6 however they did not honor happy hour prices which ended at 6 the whole dinner was such a hassle we just all paid and left"}
{"text":"The food was not good. But I'm okay with that. The ambience was just outright creepy. The beer was nothing special. All in all, I'm not looking to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Living on the other side of town, we normally stop at one of the other microbreweries when we are in this area. I'd wanted to try the Perch Pub and Brewery, though, for a while and we stopped by one Spring afternoon. 
They have a cool and knowledgable wait staff, interesting and good beer, and a really cool setting. My wife enjoyed the birds and I had fun with the beers. The weirdest thing, though, was remembering when this was the \"bad\" part of Chandler. Not any more!
(TLDR: Cool setting, great wait staff, good beer)"}
{"text":"We went there today on a Sunday afternoon. Prices were great ( even with no happy hour)  We spent some time upstairs at the roof top bar. Shawn , the bartender, was knowledgeable, very friendly, and very accommodating, as the drink I ordered could only be made downstairs in the main bar. He gladly went downstairs and got it for me. Our appetizers were awesome....highly recommend the Oyster shooters and the Sausage Board.  Can't wait to try other menu items. We stopped in the main bar for another drink and met Ifeanyi, another wonderful bartender...also friendly, and a former Arizona Cardinal player. Such a fun place to be, tropical looking with all the colorful birds, outdoor seating, plants, etc. We commented that we felt like we were away on vacation and it is almost in our own back yard. Absolutely LOVED the place. Can't wait to return !!!!"}
{"text":"I had drinks and appetizers here the other night with several picky people and everyone thought it was really good and we all enjoyed the meat and cheese board. The food is a little pricey but the beer was priced well and excellent. Our server was good and had some good recommendations. No complaints and everyone had a great time. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here on a business meeting.  Yes that's what I said Beer and business are a great combination. Just ordered appetizers but the service was really good. Will come back and try the food. Place was busy for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Saturday night roof top in January. Amazing. The service was great! The pork sliders were super delicious! The Mac and chz - eh. I won't order that again. We enjoyed ourselves. Can't wait to go again. Looking forward to taking the kids during the day to see the birds. Very unique place. Loved it."}
{"text":"We went to the Perch for the first time and was pleasantly surprised how cool and unique this place is. The food is much better than San Tan Brewery and the craft beers were also very good.

The most unique part of this place is definitely the birds! It's a very cool concept with all the outdoor seating. The Perch is definitely one of those places where you take the out-of-towners, but it also doubles as a casual hangout spot with nice brews and good food.

We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is such an awesome place! The atmosphere was so cool, the service was great, the drinks were delicious and the live music was wonderful! I had such a great night here and I want to go back whenever I get the chance!"}
{"text":"Always a great time when we come here. Food and drinks are excellent! Atmosphere is great during day for lunch. Kids love coming here too. Will have to share experiences after we get to the up stairs area when we have a sitter."}
{"text":"Just tried The Perch tonight after they remodeled and updated their menu. I was unsure of what to try, our server Ross gave me a few good suggestions! I ended up having the pork tamale which was fabulous. I'm allergic to peanuts and shellfish, which I know can be annoying to some servers and a bit of a hassle. Ross had my back and even made sure dessert was nut free!! Thank you for the great service!!"}
{"text":"Great location and the new remodel is awesome! Say on the front patio and the atmosphere was great. First time eating there and brought the whole family- all 5 menu items were great! Dad couldn't stop talking about the dip sandwich (can't remember exact name) but his comment \" best he has ever had\" - service was great and beer met my expectations!"}
{"text":"This place was great! It's a bit hard to find, but once you find it, you'll be happy that you did.  There are plenty of places to sit, so you won't have trouble finding your comfort zone.  The outside patio is perfect for a nice day or evening, as is the rooftop.  If you'd rather sit inside, the inside bar is also a great option.  We decided to share a couple of appetizers on our visit.  We went with the arepas and the pig wings.  The pig wings were delicious! The arepas didn't have much flavor and were just okay.  Unfortunately, I can't comment on the beer selection because we went with wine.  I know, I know...it's a brewery.  But now I have a good reason to return and hopefully update my review to five stars.  Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"Great place to go for happy hour. We tried a sampler of the 5 brews they have going right now and all were great. We also had a pepperoni and olive pizza which was very tasty with excellent crust and sauce. We loved the outdoor seating that was tree covered and cool. Our waiter kindly gave us a tour of their brewery which was a very neat and unique set up. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Unique atmosphere and huge portions of food. First time I've ordered a burger cooked medium and actually got medium."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, and maybe I will like it more the next time I go. The service was really my main gripe, we sat at the rooftop bar and had trouble ordering most of the evening. We predominantly had appetizers like the charcuterie board and the chicken strips, as we were planning on waiting for a table that we requested downstairs. We decided after having the apps and a few beers that we were going to move on to a different restaurant. I would like to come back during brunch with the hopes that it will be a better experience."}
{"text":"I'm a fan.  Anytime i can sit outside, drink beer, people watch, and waste the day away I am fully onboard with that plan.  It's an interesting layout with a rooftop bar/lounge, indoor pub like bar, and outdoor dining.  

The service and general operations have a way to go but i'll give it some time.  The issue with sitting upstairs is the food and most bar items are downstairs which can extend the time it takes to get your stuff.  Just more time to lounge around and watch Chandler's finest try to make themselves noticed.  

The happy hour is pretty good with $5 pizzas (really, surprising good) and discounted drinks.  The beer selection is great and they have $5 Absolut and Pinnacle drinks all the time. 

I'm interested to see how this place plays out in our brutal summers but I look forward to going back for various happy hours and casual lunches in the meantime."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Burger was bland and over cooked. Husband enjoyed his though. Service was ok. Why I gave it 4 stars is because the property is so cool and unique. Loved checking out all the rescue birds!"}
{"text":"Amazing! My wife and I love coming here during the slower hours (5-7pm). Otherwise, you start to run into the college crowd, loud, and elbow to elbow by the bar... But hey, can't hide the great places from everyone! Even if it feels like you are dining up in the tree tops!  Love this place. Bravo guys! Congrats on your success!"}
{"text":"Went out with some friends for drinks . Nice place with a nice atmosphere it was starting to get really busy so we went to the cigar bar down the street !"}
{"text":"Incredibly rude hostess... Blonde girl with pink highlights. I will never return there."}
{"text":"This place is always a great experience.  The brew selection, the menu items, the casual ambience, and of course the beautiful birds.
You can learn something here.
Seriously, you can, cuz they have classes ocasssionaly. 
The Bird Food appetizer is tripping.  Why don't they have this stuff at theaters where they NEED it?!
Nice server/bartender and informative brewers.
Groovy."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. They really go above and beyond for customer service! The food is good. It's definitely a fair price for everything they offer. With a fancy drink and food for two, you're looking at less than twenty dollars a person. When you include the atmosphere and quality, it's more than fair. The drinks are definitely a selling point, very good and underpriced. 

They give out free samples in a regular basis. Your food may take a little time in busy hours, but it comes out rather quickly, is tasty, and exactly as described. 

The Internet is fast and they have both wall outlets and USB chargers strategically placed throughout. 

The atmosphere and layout is fantastic; there is no bad seat in the house. 

I cannot wait to bring friends and family here!"}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times when The Perch was newer and the experience was so so. The location is super unique though which keeps us coming back. Now the service and the food meets the location and we are glad we continued to come back. E served us at the bar (5 star service from him), he recommended great beer, the food was exceptional, and you can't beat the cool location (the birds are such a cool touch)."}
{"text":"Great food and beer. Love the different places to hang out. Staff was great and the ambiance was even better. Will definitely keep going back."}
{"text":"Great every time.  Love the grapefruit beer & all of the gourmet tater tots are delicious!"}
{"text":"Go for the great open ambiance, the live music,the birds and the food and drinks are the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"I WANT to like this place. Each time I've gone though, the food has been mediocre at best and the service less than that. Service is very slow, they rarely come back to check on you (drink refills, etc) and it takes forever to get your check. Calling it quits- too many other restaurants in Chandler to try out. It's too bad because this place could be GREAT, but I can't even say it's good."}
{"text":"Based on prior experience, I brought my mother here expecting a quiet and serene brunch amongst the trees and birds. The Perch absolutely delivered on atmosphere- until their upstairs patio began serving bottomless mimosas and blasting music shortly after we sat down on the patio below. I am all for boozy brunch, but there is a time and a place and I am not convinced this is it."}
{"text":"I'll keep this brief as I hope they can make improvements and I can write a better review later but here it goes.....

First time here was awesome....shoot first week here was awesome! Five Stars all the way, think I made it in 5 nights the first week. Atmosphere is unlike any other place, food was good, amazing beer on draft, I was a huge advocate and recommended it to everyone, which now is quite embarrassing.  With so much potential its sad to see a place like this go down hill so quick. The last few times I've been in  everything has been absolutely miserable. Service is terrible, waiters seem confused, food and drink is sporadic on whats in stock and whats not....things are just all over in the place.....you can tell they are lacking in leadership and direction which I can see now as I hear they have parted ways with their GM. 

And the jokes in the bathroom and tables are HILARIOUS...mom really enjoyed them. 

Props to AJ (Ashley), Ethan, and Brandon....they rocked and are whats going to save this place."}
{"text":"Service kinda slow at beginning, and I ordered the Philly steak and it was cold and the cheese wasn't melted even. Definitely ridiculous to pay 15 bucks for a sub par Philly. Not worth the price. Server came back and took the Philly off the bill and redeemed the whole situation, and I didn't even ask her. So what started out as a one star review, changed to 4 stars. Well done!"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife and some friends during our pub crawl. My wife and I are totally into birds (especially large talking birds lol) and so we already knew we would be having a blast here. There are multiple cages of birds ranging from cockatoos to macaws! We came pretty late at night so most of the birds were already asleep, but I'd imagine it's even more fun observing them while they're awake.

Now on to the drinks. They have a decent variety of craft beer here including their own. I ordered the S'more Stout and thoroughly enjoyed it. Perfect combination of flavors and an appetizing aroma! I also tried some of their tater tots which were pretty bomb as well.

The only knock I have on this place is the restroom situation. Based on how crowded it gets, they should probably have more than a small single-stall room per gender. When there's a line for the men's room, it's sort of an issue hehe.

Perch is very close to the main Downtown Chandler square. So next time you're in the area, find a parking spot, enjoy the old western architecture of DC and find your way over to Perch for a good time!"}
{"text":"This place was a neat hidden spot that has a roof top bar. The place has birds in cages everywhere which was different, but the chirping wasn't as annoying as I thought it'd be. I sat on the roof top which was a nice intimate setting for 21 & up patrons. There wasn't really any amazing views up there, but the drinks were on point. They have their own made craft beers which was pretty good and their Bloody Mary was the best one I've had in a long time. It wasn't crowded. The service was slow and it was average priced."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate with this place. The setting is really really cool.  MOstly outdoors and the patio is huge.  The concept here is the fact that there are exotic birds all over, hence \"The Perch\".   It really is cool. HOwever, most of the birds are from tropical environments, so the animal lover in me was torn. Yes they are rescued but desert-tropical is a vast difference.

The food is good, nothing overwhelming.  Great atmophere and tons of room."}
{"text":"Came in with a party of 10, waited for 2 hours like they told us, ended up playing bags and jenga which was fun... However they made us order from the bar for a group of 10 food and drinks, so no server.... 2.5 hours later we ended up leaving and I alarm the hostess how long the wait was and she said \"we have no wait\" some how their wait disappeared and we still never got a table! Worst experience for wait, they need to hire more people asap!!!"}
{"text":"One of the most unique restaurants in the valley. Stopped by for breakfast (which was delicious). Within the restaurant is plenty of trees and wild birds. The experience is something else! They have a rooftop patio too, which would be great to check out next time I'm back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome
Great beers and selections.
Food hits the spot.
The staff is super friendly and attentive.
The ambiance is incredible.
If you hate birds and all the noise associated with birds then this isn't the place for you.
It's also a good place to bring the kiddos to eat and check out the different birds.  There were more families than I'd expect at a gastro pub, but it's pretty cool place to eat.
Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Good service and good food. I had the perch burger and it was delicious! Good beer too!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason why I'm leaving two stars is because we eventually had a server come to our bar table (after having been there for a couple hours) and she made the entire negative experience much better with quick service.

I will start by saying we were there for St. Patrick's Day/our friends birthday so yes we knew it would be busy. However the bar itself should have known it would be busy too and scheduled an all hands on deck type of night. Maybe they were short staffed (it was obvious) sure, but the blatant disregard for paying customers by your bartenders was insulting. 

We stood there WAITING for over 30 minutes before even being acknowledged. We watched the same bar patron be served over and over and over again, maybe it was his wad of $20's he kept flashing around and they assumed he would leave a good tip if they gave him all of their attention. The icing on the cake was a new group showed up and waited about 5 minutes before being served while we were still ignored. It was completely ridiculous. 

I'm a GM myself, and would never tolerate that type of behavior. There clearly was NO bar manager present, and if there was... well there's your problem."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night, so of course they were super busy. There was quite the wait to be seated so we headed upstairs (after checking out all the awesome birds of course). Unfortunately all of the upstairs seats and lounge areas were reserved, so sitting at the bar was our only choice. We managed to get two seats after only a little bit of standing around. The bar staff was super busy, but we were helped rather quickly, which was awesome! My first drink order was made entirely wrong, not sure what the drink in my hand even consisted of... but another bartender checked on us and made me a new drink, which was perfect this time! We spent about 2 hours here, then we moved on. Will definitely be back, but next time at a less busy time, as I'm intrigued by the uniqueness of the place."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place out since it opened, we check the website saw some items we wanted to try but when we arrived the menu didn't have it. We chose other food items they both were pretty good, we sat inside which was pretty cool setting. Our up waiter was real cool and helpful he checked on us periodically to see if we needed anything else. Good time on a weeknight, our next visit we will bring the kids!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast today.  My family and I thought The Perch simply offered lunch and dinner.  We were driving by, got hungry and stopped in.  We were met by Travis who is one of the best and friendly servers we have ever had the pleasure of meeting.  All three meals were fantastic.  One more thing; the price for the food was just great.
Heading back soon to enjoy another Saturday breakfast, the weather and listen to all the birds."}
{"text":"Love the birds! , misters, big shade trees...atmosphere !
Travis gave great service!! Thank you!
We enjoyed the Rueben and Clam chowder bread bowl!!
Great sweet Stout beer!
This is a must see.......!!!!"}
{"text":"Music playing, twinkle lights, exotic birds chirping, and a great ambiance is what you will notice when you walk in the perch. I absolutely love this cozy little restaurant that is a hidden gem in downtown chandler. The staff is friendly and very helpful. The food is fresh and unique, not your average greasy plate that other restaurants offer. This is a great place for a romantic date or a great girls night out on \"wine down Wednesdays\". If you are looking for a great patio with an amazing view of the Arizona sunset, this is the spot. The rooftop patio isn't open Tuesdays and Wednesdays though so remember that for your next visits. Great place and worth the time to check it out and enjoy a great craft beer or nice glass of wine."}
{"text":"Favorite place for date night and brunch. The ambiance is amazing! String lights, birds, and lots and lots of plants. You forget you're in Chandler for a second! 

Not only is the environment fun but the food is absolutely delicious. I have a hard time ordering because I'm always torn between wanting to try something new and getting what I got last time because I know they're both going to be good. 

The beers are mostly craft beers. I prefer beers that are not very hoppy and they still have a good selection for people like me who enjoy basic white girl beer. My more adventurous boyfriend likes the IPAs. The servers have always been knowledgeable when we ask about what's on tap.

Highly recommend the patio at night. Perfect place to just sit and drink and take it all in."}
{"text":"This Brewery was really awesome! Great selection of craft beers and amazing selection of food. The concept is clutch! I really enjoyed the outdoor setting along with the awesome bird cages"}
{"text":"Seriously. When you sit upstairs and order food- does the waitstaff go to San tan brewery to pick up the food? even when they are slow the service is poor. The waitstaff is great / friendly- but such slow service!"}
{"text":"The Perch Pub & Brewery is one of Downtown Chandler's best kept secrets, but probably won't be for long! 

Walk through a seedy neighborhood, think you're lost, then the gate appears. 

Allow yourself to be transported out of Chandler, if only for a brief hour or two. 

The downstairs patio area is b-e-a-utiful. You can't miss 'em, but make sure you walk around and check out all the exotic avians. Luna is known to put on a show for guests. Silly girl. 

You can either sit on the patio, in the indoor bar area, but the rooftop lounge is where it's at. 

You'll find heat lamps to keep toasty during our \"cooler\" months, lots of comfy furniture and another bar. 

Basically, it's the perfect atmosphere for a party. Think you can even reserve part of the deck for this purpose! 

As mentioned in previous reviews, you absolutely must try their beers they brew on site! 

The sampler is ginormous (see picture). Get it if you can't decide on a beer to order, which with their extensive list, you will. The struggle is REAL! 

I've tried the Chocolate Porter, Rosemary IPA, Ginger MoFo (add a squeeze of lime to take it to another level, son!), Strawbery and Peach Beers and some kind of Butternut Squash Ale. 

What to eat? Some of my favorites, so far . . . 

1) Green Chile Pork Pizza 

Tender pork, tasty but not spicy green chile, melt in your mouth crusts. One of the better pizzas I've had the pleasure of putting in my mouth in Chandler. 

2) Wings 

Jalapeño Marmalade and Barbeque IPA, the first being a favorite. All of their wings are smoked and fall off the bone delicious. 

3) Carnitas Street Tacos 

Again with the tender pork! Watch out if you don't like spicy; because the green chili will knock you out. No sides necessary, this dish comes with a black bean puree and a delicious pico de gallo, all nestled in a warm corn tortilla. 

4) Tots Poutine 

For the Love of Kraken, if you're going to get any kind of drunk munchies here, let it be this. Crispy tots smothered in stout gravy with a smattering of bacon and cheese curds.

Basically, plan on clogging up your arteries. You can get mini ones on happy hour, or go balls out and get the huge order with a group.

Never a bad experience with a server; always attentive and remember us by name.

The Perch is a nice change of pace from all the other establishments in the area. You'd be making a mistake not to check it out at least once, whether it's for a casual dinner or impressing a date with the unique ambience. 

With all the new restaurants and bars I tried in 2014, you get the number one spot, Perch. 

Happy New Year, Yelp Phoenix! :)"}
{"text":"Went to the Perch for the first time and loved it. We came in on a Thursday night around 10pm so it wasn't very crowded at all. Loved the entry way with off of the rescue birds and thought the garden courtyard was amazing. 

I was looking at reviews on the way here and saw a lot if negative reviews mostly due to service so I was a little worried about this place. I don't know how it gets if it's busy but we went to the bar on this night and had great service, but we just ordered beers. They had a TV with the beer menu so it was easy to see what they had.  I love craft beer and that is all they serve. Also they are in the process of brewing their own beer but none of it was ready at this time. 

So our service at the bar was great. I didn't try any of the food but one of my friends ordered a pizza and it came out quickly and he said it was real good

What I really liked about the Perch was the ambiance. How cool of a place to showcase rescue exotic birds. Yes they will bite and there are signs everywhere but Luna was so nice that she came up to the fence and allowed us to put her stomach. Really cool, but we knew when she turned her beak to stand clear. It's common sense with exotic birds. Also two of the servers/bartenders came out and talked to us about the birds and even took Hercules, the giant one, out and talked about each bird and their stories. I love animals and rescues so how can I not like this place!

After ordering a round of beers we went up to the roof too lounge and sat for a while. There is a bar upstairs but limited taps so most of the beers are brought up from downstairs. After reading reviews service might be slow or confusing so if possible order from the bar downstairs and come up. 

On a side note, the garden area of the Perch is also shared with a salon and a breakfast/lunch business. Super cool..a great way to support local business. 

I will be back here, I just loved the location and patio. Hope the misters work in the summer because it will be hot but we live in Az so who cares!"}
{"text":"Went to The Perch with a buddy of mine yesterday for beers and lunch. 

The Good:
They have an extensive beer list, with some really great beers. I was a fan of the strawberry beer, and the grapefruit slam IPA. Ordered the black bean patty salad, and it was very tasty and enjoyable. Went up to the top of the restaurant, and there is a great lounge area that was awesome to sit at in the great weather. The environment of the restaurant was very nice, they have birds in cages, and it almost looks like a patio, but in a good way. I enjoyed what was around me while eating. 

The Bad:
The service was terrible. My buddy got his beer first, and mine took so long to get that I literally forgot I ordered it. No joke. Our salads came very slowly too. Even the waitress approached us at one point asking, \"where are your salads?\" to which I replied, \"good question!\" We all had a laugh, and I wasn't trying to be rude, but it REALLY was taking too long for a salad. It also took just as long to get our check, and the waitress mixed up our bills multiple times. Because of this, when I got home, I came to find out that she had charged my card for my lunch AND my buddy's. I called the restaurant back and gave them my information...the general manager was who I spoke with and he apologized and told me he cancelled the extra charge. Of course, this happened on a saturday, so I am still waiting to see if it will in fact cancel, or fall off my account come tomorrow. As of right now, I'm down 30 dollars that I should have. Very irritated about this. 

All in all, if it wasn't for the service and the bill mix up, I would have given it a much higher rating. I WILL go back in hopes that this was a one time fluke, and hopefully will have a better experience next time. Guess we'll see!"}
{"text":"NOT DOG FRIENDLY!! I guess you can't believe everything you read online (even though it's on their website, their web designer \"hasn't had time to update yet\") really disappointed. Drove from the west valley to try this place and were turned away. Thank goodness for SanTan Brewing just down the road for allowing our pups on their patio so we didn't have to waste our trip!"}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy the perch for their food. I brought two friends who emerge from out of town here so they could see why I liked it so much. However, I went today for the first time in a while & was extremely disappointed. My favorite things used to be the pretzels and beer cheese and the cheese and bacon tots. However, they are completely changing the menu. The menu they gave us was not accurate either and didn't list the happy hour choices for appetizers. Our server told us what they were but didn't say the prices. We assumed they would be similar to the old appetizer prices on the menu. We ordered the pretzels and tots, however they have completely changed both items. Our server also was hardly at our table- even to take our order he quickly went through as we ordered appetizers and then ran off. We weren't able to order our meals & he left our menus. We didn't see him until after we received our appetizers, and at that point we didn't want to wait for food to be cooked. He was slow on refilling our waters as well. Throughout the entire night he probably stopped at our table three times, and each was for less than 20 seconds.  The food was not as good as it used to be & was a lot more expensive than we expected- even at happy hour. While I do like this place for its uniqueness & the birds, I doubt I will come back after this experience."}
{"text":"It was highly recommended so I said let's do it. As the sun started to set (9/3/2016), we wanted a place to chill, relax, visit, and enjoy a cold beer or cocktail. Our name was taken with a 45 minute wait but offered we could go next door while we waited. Minutes later we got the 'buzz'. The outdoor was cooling down with the cool mist. We ordered some cocktails which were 'ok'. Customer service was not the best. We seem to be forgotten since we were seated away from the others. A few times I asked other wait staff to find our waiter. Not likely I would stop by again..maybe."}
{"text":"My first time their and the service was fine. Menu and ordering was sufficient time. And the food was good."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for the first time this afternoon.  They have a bunch of local beers on tap, significant wine list, and looked like all the liquor you needed to make any cocktail.  The roof wasn't open yet, but it was too hot anyway.  I guess it opens at 6:00 pm in the summer and earlier times in the other seasons.  The inside is super cool as I'm sure you can see from the other reviews.  In addition to the beers we had, we got a pizza with pepperoni and green chili pork...I'm not sure that matches, but it sure was good!  And only $5 for Happy Hour.  We were lucky enough to have \"E\" as a bartender.  He was super cool and knew the his beers as well has the menu very well, and didn't try to up-sell anything.    Hopefully if you go, you'll get him as your bartender.  We're glad Chandler has a place like this and are looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. I like the place. It's a great place to hang out with friends and watch some football. I think a couple of the hostess need to smile a little bit more though. I was in there once for happy hour with friends got seated and our server had came and taken our order and drinks. It took 20 minutes to get our drinks. Then one of the servers came and told us we have a different server and we'd have to place our food orders again. All in all any other times I've been there it's been good other than that incident."}
{"text":"Always busy but busy for a reason :) Well worth it! FYI: There's an adjoining place next door, Chicago 52(?), that's also very good! A great option if The Perch is too crowded. Staff has always been nice and food always delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place the food and the atmosphere is great.  DT chandler is doing a great job revitalizing."}
{"text":"Love love love the atmosphere. We order beer and two appitizers (meat board and the pig wings). You need to try the pork wings with the jalapeño dip - seriously it's amazing! Our waiter was friendly and quick with service. Walking around and seeing all the rescue birds was original and fun. I love the whole scene and vibe this place. Check it out sometime!"}
{"text":"We finally tried The Perch today at lunch and we are so glad we did! The patio areas are very inviting and shaded. And there are quite a few birds in cages near the entrance. We tried the Green Chili Pork Pie Pizza and the Artichoke Grilled Cheese as well as beer, of course. Food was great. Service was great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Our last few visits have been stellar. Food and beer fantastic as usual. Service has greatly improved! I really hope they keep it up!"}
{"text":"The Perch Brewery ... pffft ... total jerks. I'm totally done with this place and will never go back. 

You see, my wife and I, and many many of our friends have been coming to this area for several years and well before the Perch Brewery was open for business. There is this quaint little breakfast and lunch restaurant located in the southwest corner of the property called Yoli's Café. Yoli's is one of our favorite restaurants to go to and as previously mentioned we are regulars and have many friends and family who are also regulars. So for breakfast Yoli's is always a great call especially with the ambience of the common area center patio. Chef Yoli has exceptional food. There is some real love that goes into that cooking and she uses all natural ingredients and the end results is always awesomeness. 

We also would frequent the Perch because we love the area's ambiance. The Perch food is mediocre at best. We tried several times and it's always been hit or miss. The last time I ordered a medium rare burger it was cooked grey well-done. Gross. Service is also a bit lackluster and never consistent which I hate. However, I always came back as I like the beer selections. No more though ... ever. Jerks. 

You see, The Perch Brewery in their greedy wisdom decided that it was okay to be total a-holes to their neighbors at Yoli's Café. They felt it was a good idea to weld a big-ol metal fence barring any type of access to the common area in/out from Yoli's Café. So the other day when we arrived and entered the area from the east-side parking, there is absolutely no access into Yoli's whatsoever anymore. It took several minutes before we could figure out even how to get into Yoli's. This metal fence is just obtuse and ugly. Soon after we were seated another group of people came in for breakfast and one of them said to the server, \"what's with the ugly metal barrier out there? It was a real journey just to try to get in here! Are they trying to put you out of business or what?\" Those are my mirrored feelings exactly.

It's your business decision as the Perch Brewery to act in this unfriendly and greedy manner if you choose; however, just realize that your actions cause customer reactions and our reaction to your neighborly unfriendliness is to never ever spend another dime at the Perch Brewery again. Instead I will just go down the street to SanTan brewery for my draft beer cravings, and bring everyone else with me.

Oh, and moreover, the lame excuse that we were given from the server about it being due to liquor law is a bunch of friggin' hooey. Have some integrity to be truthful.  I'm very very well-versed in Title IV and that's just a crock. You could have put signs up that said \"no alcohol beyond this point.\" And if you still wanted your ugly metal barrier fence up to separate the two businesses you easily could've been a friendly neighbor and had a gate installed for access into your neighbor's business as an easement for her customers, and again with a sign that says \"no alcohol beyond this point.\" So shove that lame excuse up your Perch.

We'll continue to spend money at Yoli's but never ever again at The Perch Brewery. You people are total jerks and messing with others livelihood is super uncool and karma will teach you a lesson on that soon enough. Just remember that when it starts to happen to your business."}

*Cue Surfin' Bird music* Everybody knows that the bird is the word! Actually, there are no surfin' birds here (That I know of at least), but there are quite a lot of adorable tropical flighted ones at The Perch. I'll admit, I didn't really come here for the food or drink. I came here primarily because you get to sit outside and eat with cool looking feathered friends (#birdnerd). Since it was happy hour, we figured we'd order a few appetizers and take in the ambiance since I have had this place in my bookmarks list forever.

All the appetizers on the happy hour menu are $8. We decided on sharing three of them: The soft pretzels with cheese dip, the pub tots, and green chile pork. While we were waiting for our food I walked around and said hi to all the lovely birds. The winged wonders come from AZ Exotic Bird Rescue and I think it's great that they are promoting rescue here. The birds themselves looked like they were very well taken care of and happy.

The appetizers were a hefty size and looked great. You have your choice of three different sauce/topping combinations with the pub tots; I chose the jalapeno marmelade and ranch. The tots themselves were well cooked and lightly crispy. I liked the kick of heat from the jalapeno juxtaposed with the sweetness of the marmelade. I found that the tots became too salty for my tastes the more I ate them though. The same could really be said for the pretzels and pork. Everything was way too salty for me. As for the pretzels, they are served with beer cheese and the cheese had more of a chopped curd/cottage cheese texture rather than a melted fondue-like texture that I typically see with similar dishes at other restaurants. The green chile pork was probably the best tasting of the three items we got and I enjoyed the thick grilled tortillas they came with. It was initially was very watery though and hard to eat with the tortillas without chile-pork juice dribbling all over me as I ate it. 

Since we ate outside on the patio it's natural to have some bird mess on the tables every now and then but the table we sat at looked like the bird droppings had been crusted on the table for quite some time. Our hostess did wipe down the table before we sat down though. Our table was directly under a tree which provided some nice shade but also became a bird bomb site as some sparrows and doves decided to roost above us towards the end of our meal. We had a close call or two! 

Since they have a good selection of beer here it's probably worth it to come here for happy hour beverages but I probably wouldn't come here again solely for the food. I really do like how they combine bird rescue with a restaurant atmosphere though."}
{"text":"The Perch is a nice spot in Chandler to grab some local craft beer and some good food. They have a few of their own beers, but have a good selection of other beers as well. You can follow their beer menu on Taphunter, which is usually when I decide to visit. They have a 4 oz flight glass for $2 so it is cheap to try new thinks. The pint is usually around $5. I have had some of the pizzas too, and I highly recommend those.  I usually end up taking half of it home with me.

One of the big features of the brewery is the outdoor seating. There is a nice courtyard with plenty of seating (and plenty of birds in cages), there is a large bar downstairs, and there is another bar with ample outdoor seating upstairs. The key is to always go to the hostess and be seated. The sign says see hostess for seating in the tables, but it isn't really clear about sitting at the bar. See the hostess for that too because if you just walk in and sit down it is not very likely you will be seen and get a menu or drink any time soon."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere at this place.  The outdoor patios and lotss of \"cool\" features at this neighborhood grill.  I love the Chipotle Chicken Ceasar salad!"}
{"text":"Perfect late Sunday afternoon spot with an awesome early dinner of burgers and craft beers and great service combined with cool fans and misters out on the patio. Loved it and can't wait to return."}
{"text":"My sister lives on the east side of town and has been raving about this place for months especially their brunch. We went last Saturday and it was under whelming. The customer service wasn't great. The waitress seemed annoyed and in a hurry before with could attempt to order my daughters food first. . You could barely see where the kid portion was because it was faded and hard to read . I let that go. It was a while before the food came out and when it did it was Luke warm borderline cold. We got a pizza and Mac and cheese to split and both could've been good if they were hot.  It sure what was wrong with this day but let me tell you I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"I loved the outdoor seating. Very lush and lots of cool birds. Use the no wait app to get in line before you get to the restaurant. The craft beer was very good. Reasonable prices and very good food. Good service too."}
{"text":"The freaking Perch!!!! 
This place gets me in trouble! The drinks are yummy and the food is devilish! I barely remember what we ordered but do remember it was highly recommended from our fun bartender who was putting in work! This place gets super busy but the service is not compromised. The buffalo tater tots are so crispy and perfect we order those whenever we pop in. 
I always end up drinking and eating too much when we come here because it's so easy to just chill and enjoy the outside ambiance when you're here. The vibes are relaxing. We dig this place and hope you decide to end up here in your journey, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Really cool concept. Drink prices are nothing special and have not have the food yet."}
{"text":"I haven't even eaten here yet and it's already been a nightmare. My dad wants to eat here for his birthday so I called to make a reservation for 10 people and the hostess told me that she cannot make the reservation because with a large party, a manager needs to make it. So I ask for a manager, but she informs me that there is no manager on duty! WHAT? How do you not have a manager on duty ON FRIDAY NIGHT at 7pm?!?? Seriously??? So she tells me to email the manager? Again, what? I say that the reservation is for the next evening so I need to get this done or look elsewhere. So then she gives me the managers cells phone number!!! Again, WHAT?!?? Hahaha so I call the number and the manager informs me that she is driving so I should text her the info then she will call the restaurant and make my reservation. So I text her. I waited a little over an hour to call the restaurant again to make sure the reservation is made. Someone named Kayleigh answers and I explain that I was just calling to check if the reservation is made and I explained that I already spoke to the manager and Kayleigh was just so rude I couldn't even believe it. She just keeps telling me to email the manager or to call in the morning in a nasty tone and saying she didn't have time to do anything right now because she is too busy. Honestly after this birthday dinner, never coming here again."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!! The food is great, with a totally different selection of dishes than you find at most of the typical restaturants in the area~ Plus, you can't beat the ambiance on a beatiful sunny day. Happy hour starts early, recommend getting there early 'cuz it gets packed FAST!"}
{"text":"I think the only thing this place has going for is its atmosphere, which is top notch, and if it was on that I'd give 5 stars alone, but other than that this place was pretty bad. 

Service was good, but we were basically the only table as it was late on a Tuesday night. the food was okay, but the portions are pretty small for the price you pay. Which echo's the sentiments in other negative reviews. 

Not a great happy hour food menu, as the small plates were $8 only about $2 less than regular menu price. I was disappointed because I had ordered the perch pretzels on HH, and on the regular menu it says it comes with 3 pretzels, but I only received 2 when I got it on Happy Hour. Which turns out to you paying more per pretzel, when you get it on HH, had I known this I would have just paid the $2 more to get another pretzel because we were splitting them with our table. The mac and cheese was good, and they did advertise it was a mini but boy was it small. Only around 5 bites worth. For $8 I expect a little bit more. Also tried the Prime Dip (which you couldn't really dip because it was an open-face sandwich) but for $17 I expect to be wow'ed by a sandwich and this didn't do it for me. 

Now for the beers, between our table we got the Hef, the Blonde, a Black IPA and the Saison. I didn't mind the hef, blonde and the BIPA, but again there was nothing really creative or innovative about these beers. Just a lot of mediocrity. 

However the Saison was awful. I do realize this was a Brett beer, so I was expecting something funky. But this beer straight up tasted like I just got a nosebleed, and some of the blood dripped into my mouth. Everyone at my table tried it and agreed, that it was not good. It got a little more palatable as I drank it, but it was still not something I would recommend to anyone or get again. 

Overall, I would never choose to come to this place again, and I will tell my friends to avoid this place in the future. The birds were cool, but they really don't make up for the fact for the overpriced food and mediocre beer."}
{"text":"Checked No Wait app to make sure we would get in, as half of my family suffers from \"hangry disorder\" to see \"Come on In\" and agree the perch was a great place to treat my fatherinlaw in his first visit to our home!  (He's from Memphis, TN and in for the holidays). Arrive and find parking somewhat easily.  There is currently one lady in front of me at the hostess booth, and when it is my turn I explain we have 5.  The 2 hostess proceed to tell me there is currently a 45 min wait on the patio (preferred seating) or inside can be sat almost immediately, as well as upstairs being open availability.  (No mention of it being 21 and up ONLY)   (I understand, and have come to terms with the fact that my 12 yr old looks older than she is, but she is no where near 21 yr old looking, let's not even mention the 6 yr old hanging on my arm ready to look at the birds!!

I tried to explain the concept of the no wait app to the hostesses and how they were supposed to inform would be diners of expectations-BLANK STARES- followed with we don't do that here.?!?!

Our youngest daughter had to show me a fire-in which was near the over half empty patio (45 min wait you say?-take a hostess and make her wait tables?!)

We are sat, and my husband ventures upstairs with our youngest to see if there is a neat fire we could sit by, only to be hastily kicked out (which we understand, and never had ventured up there had the hostesses been more knowledgeable....) 

Drinks took over 15 minutes to arrive, our app was ordered at same time and still hasn't shown.  And I'm only nervous to see how the food comes out or if....

Food better be worth it!!
The clam chowder was delicious!!  the tots came well after our meal.  The pretzel was amazing, and the wings were a decent portion!  Maybe pass on the buffalo waffle fries....

Will say, the manager was willing to work with us and listened enthusiastically to the constructive criticism."}
{"text":"Me and 2 of my friends were just refused an alcoholic beverage. I asked, Chris the manager, why!  He stated after he looked into our eyes he was convinced we had enough. I am European, my other friend is from Puerto Rico, my other friend is from Bolivia. We didn't have 5 alcoholic beverages each this evening but Chris must be an expert on 'eyes'. We think he is a racist and believe Perch made a huge mistake to have this guy as an employee. We have never felt this embarrassed by any establishment."}
{"text":"Stopped by after spending all day with my mom waiting for my father to get through a heart operation and after 11 hours in the hospital a stop here for a q uick tasking was a welcome relief.

I didn't have the food but the tasking of the beers made in house was fun and this place has a great vibe, lots of birds in cages and trees provide a natural feel to the place and the always important hipster staff that wonderfully, are friendly and invite you into the wonderful world of hipster craft brew culture. When my dad gets a pacemaker at Chandler Regional in a few months I'm definitely coming by again - this time, hopefully, for a full meal. 

Bottom line, a unique place that is worth a drive to visit. :-)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the food, drinks and atmosphere. Only complaint would be how busy it gets/how long the wait can be on the weekend, but such is life when a place is this good!"}
{"text":"This place is so cool! I enjoyed brunch here a lot. The fact that you can sit outside in a hidden garden-ish patio is already exciting. Their servings are pretty large and their menu provides a good variety. It's always fun to discover hidden restaurants. This place is busy but still provide an intimate environment. Awesome."}
{"text":"Love this place, so much fun! This is mostly an outside bar, but there is an inside if you don't want to sit in \"AZ Cold\" weather lol! They have the heating vents placed all around the outside, lights hanging, music playing, chairs, tables, couches and of course, it is decorated for Christmas...... lots of fun! The Perch has its own brewery in the back, so if you like different beers, this place is a good place to try! Their food selection is OK, not fantastic, but decent. I like to go more for the atmosphere, enjoy the nice weather, listen to live music and catch up with friends! This place is very random and different, one of the main reasons I like it so much! Its also right in down town chandler, so if you like Christmas light looking, you can check that out down town after you're done enjoying this place! Have fun!!!"}
{"text":"Yet another updatefor The Perch. I like these guys, I want to keep giving them a fair chance, and throughout the past couple of years, they're gradually improving. We went there a few nights ago, and they've revised their menu and upped their prices. My husband and mom got the burgers and tots, and I got the Spinach Artichoke Grilled Cheese and tots. We all really liked it, and it was an improvement from the last time we went.

They still seem to be struggling with their identity. Strange things are on the menu...that seem VERY out of place. I know it takes time for businesses to find their niche, but items like the  \"Meat and Cheese Board\", \"Duck Reuben\" and \"Sin City Burger\" (with lobster and prime rib) seem very out of place. Most of their menu items are awesome, like the Beer Cheese Soup (very fitting for a brewery) chicken fingers and burgers, but when we all saw some of the menu items, we all looked at each other with a \"WTF?\" look on our faces. 

Our waiter was a really nice guy, but the service could have been faster. My mom waited on her beer for almost 15 minutes, and it wasn't that busy. Overall, each time we come back, it continues to improve. Just don't go when the sun is setting, for some reason the birds go nuts and are so loud you can barely have a conversation.They calmed down a lot once the sun had been set for a while.

*Final note - we've ALWAYS been extremely impressed with their own beer, it's fantastic*"}
{"text":"The service upstairs where we met for drinks before dinner was absolutely fabulous.  Dinner itself was okay but the service was not as prompt or friendly.  As a matter of fact we had to track down our server more than once.   I had the tamale, which was an interesting take on a traditional favorite.  They also have a create-your-own Mac-n-Cheese that looked interesting.  The environment is different...really different.  Lots of birds - and I mean lots - all over the courtyard in cages.  The birds are beautiful but they are also loud."}
{"text":"I somehow didn't realize this was a bird bar despite the obvious name of \"The Perch\". I'm not a fan of birds and probably would have opted to skip this place had I been more cognizant. Glad I was a lil slow that day cuz this place was great. Yes there are birds, lots of them, but they're all in cages and there are plenty of areas to sit not near them. Plus even a birdhater like myself can appreciate some of the colorful ones are kinda pretty. The beer selection is huge and awesome. We sat inside near the bar and our server was the assistant brewer. He was super helpful and gave us interesting little tidbits about some of their different beers. We tried a cucumber ipa, lemongrass ipa, and their blonde. All were great! We shared the pretzels to eat which had a really tasty mustard and cheese served with them. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went here for a  bite to eat & a few drinks while I was in town visiting my parents.  Upon getting there, I did not see a hostess at the stand for awhile so I sat myself.  When I did get a seat it took quite awhile to get greeted.  When I finally got some service, he informed me that they were supposed to have 6 servers, 2 bartenders, a busser, and a hostess; but there was only 2 servers.  Needless to say service was slow the entire night, but I gave the guy the benefit of the doubt the entire night.  He seemed so frazzled that he got to the point of not caring anymore, I really did feel bad for him.

The atmosphere was a cool outdoor bar with a bunch of rescue birds.  That is where the birds were cool.  The place had the slight tinge of urea smell (bird poo smell) & squawking birds which got so bad at one point it sounded like one was being waterboarded and giving birth.  

The beer selection was good & they actually server their Moscow Mules (and their several variants of it) in the copper mug, big plus for me.  This category was 4 stars!

Finally was the food.  My friend got a Margarita Pizza, it looked kind of blah.  She said it did not taste that great.  I ordered the Perch burger w/ tater tots.  The tots were soooo greasy.  They left a snail trail where they were sitting on the paper.  The burger was initially great, but this is where the big problem happened, there was a used twisty tie in my burger.  When I alerted the server, he removed the twisty tie with his bare hand (it had just been in my mouth) and walked off with it.  When he came back he let me know the management would give me a free drink. I worked in the industry for almost 4 years and I would have comped an entire bill if that occurred to my table, especially with all the other BS that was going on.   IT ended up being a $47 tab, it was his loss because if he comped the whole check I would have given him the entire thing as a tip.  Instead he got 25%.


Will I be back?  Not at all likely.  Think this was a one and done for me.  I highly recommend trying something else in downtown Chandler, there are plenty of other options."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this place COULD be amazing. It has a lot of things going for it. The location, atmosphere, and menu are definitely the reasons to check this place out. That being said.... this place needs A LOT of help. Upon arrival, we were told it would be about a 30 minute wait. Not too bad for a Friday night. We were seated in about 20 minutes. Our seats were near the bird cages...so it was a bit loud, but bearable. Our waitress didn't come to check on us until about 15 minutes later. She appeared to be intoxicated. After talking to us about the birds for 5 minutes and how crazy of a day it had been, we finally asked HER if she could take our drink order. Big mistake. We waited 20 minutes for ONE beer to come out. The waitress said the keg had run out so she wasn't able to get my girlfriend's beer. The problem was, my girlfriend didn't order a beer, she ordered a martini. When her martini finally came out 20 minutes later, there was a bug in it. We then placed our food order; an appetizer and two entrees. Our waitress came back 2 minutes after the order was placed to ask what I had ordered because she couldn't remember (she didn't bother writing our order down). Our meals came out fairly quickly.... But the appetizer was nowhere to be found. The entrees were average. Not great, but not horrible either. All in all, was it an awful experience? No. Will we go back? Probably not."}
{"text":"Looking forward to trying this new delish Brewery. We got there about 5:45 Friday after Thanksgiving and assumed it would be early enough to get an outside table. We were disappointed to find many empty tables yet there was a wait of a half hour to an hour to get an outside table. We opted for the first available. After waiting about 20 minutes we were sat inside at a table in front of the biggest TV that you can imagine we were literally three feet from the screen. We started with appetizers we did the chefs board and the pretzel. When you look at the menu the chefs board is quite expensive but the amount of food that comes on it more than qualifies  the price. We were very pleased with all the meats and cheeses and different surprises like the prosciutto-wrapped baby asparagus with a lemon creme fraiche. All Meats cheeses dips were very good and we were quite happy with this selection. The pretzel, while nothing exceptional was good came out hot and my son enjoyed. The sad part is that our entrees came shortly after our appetizers arrived, not allowing much room on the table nor time  between courses to truly enjoy our appetizers. The entrees were good, my wife had the tamale plate which was outstanding I had the Prime Steak dip which was good and our other company had salad and pizza which were average. I was overall pleased with the service our waiter was very good and other than the food timing and feeling rushed sitting in front of a drive-in movie screen the overall experience was slightly above-average. The beer was good, nothing exceptional that I tried. We will try it again and hopefully get a seat outside at one of the many empty tables."}
{"text":"Ordered BLT brunch, came out cold, soggy fries. 2 strip of bacon?? Why do the call it a BLT?  Really did suck, last time I try eating here.  I will say owner took the food off our tab, so that was good and the right thing to do"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here! What a unique hidden gem in Chandler. The location and atmosphere feels like you are in a tropical place not in Arizona. The food was a 3.75/5, the beers were good. Unique craft brewery. The rooftop was cool to go up to after dinner and enjoy more drinks. Beautiful views and unique crowds. Would definitely recommend for a cool atmosphere and good drinks."}
{"text":"This is Chandlers hidden gem! I have past this place a number of times but never noticed it. My friends and I went to get a drink and I'm so glad we did. We sat on the roof top and got great recommendations by the regulars sitting next to us and the bartender steven. The wings and the tamale dish were delicious this is my new place to go with friends."}
{"text":"Maybe it was a perfect day in AZ to eat outside or we hit a good day at The Perch Pub, sat outside under the trees surrounded by all the birds. We ordered the Perch Burger (burger with a fried onion ring, cheese, jalapeño relish and bacon) and the Cuban sandwich. Both came with their homemade Tater Tots, dressed with a little too much salt, but was still good. Good place to kick back and relax for lunch."}
{"text":"Went to The Perch last night to meet friends. This is another great hidden gem in Chandler that's becoming very popular. The Perch has two levels. The lower level is the main restaurant and the upper level is the bar. We went up to the bar area and watched a friend play live music. The drinks were priced right and the food was decent. Most bar style food, but the portions are a good size, so you won't go away hungry.There are also lots of parrots and parrot family birds here (Cockatoos, cockatiels, parrots, etc... All of the birds are rescue birds that the owner's adopted."}
{"text":"Very unique place and has definitely carved out its own niche in the heart of downtown Chandler.   Huge outdoor area. So far I really enjoyed everything about The Perch.  had the Ginger Style beer and it was shockingly refreshing.  I would classify this place in the GastroPub style- (creative menu an excellent beer choices).   There were out of a few styles when I went, but they also weren't your every day choices and could see limited quantities running out quickly.  I already loved going to downtown Chandler for San Tan Brewery and this is just another reason why it's a must go to area any day of the week."}
{"text":"Went here on a nice evening in May for happy hour. By the looks of driving by the place I was expecting more but wasn't bad. The food was rather good, The service was ok. Lots of birds everywhere. I did get a little grossed out as one waitress would walk by this bird several times and would stop and pet him. Next thing you know she's carrying someone's chicken sandwich. Just happy she wasn't ours. Lots of choices in downtown Chandler so not sure if it made that much of an impression on me to return."}
{"text":"First time here and had a great experience. I got the shrimp salad which was decent size with spicy shrimp on top. I also had to get a beer since they are a microbrewery..I had the peach one yum! We went on a Thursday night where they had live music (Flavour) on the rooftop..great soul jazz band. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Doesnt look like much on the outside, but once you get inside its actually pretty classy and the food is great. The in house IPA was so good i had to buy a growler...except the growler broke open in my rental car and i didnt get to share any lol"}
{"text":"Love this place, discovered it a couple years ago when it first opened (eating at Yoli's for breakfast - great homemade breakfast). 
Pros: Unique atmosphere, birds are interesting and the story behind them, the garden like seating down stairs, the open bar/ band rooftop seating is wonderful, outside games also a nice touch, food generally above par for a place like this and beer and drinks A++
Cons: Place is always busy, can't make reservations, their popularity is obviously causing some growing pains - additionally with the businesses they share space with - hense a fence has gone up and they are expanding."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here before, there is a small parking lot next to the restaurant. However, the likelihood of getting a spot might be slim.  A public parking dirt/gravel lot is nearby. 

You cannot miss this place. You will hear the birds calling...maybe calling out to you...and it is loud whether you are inside or out!

Started with a surprisingly refreshing light and crisp grapefruit beer @ a whopping 2.5% ETOH content. Perfect for the lush alike! 

The Perch pretzel ($7) came as it's true pretzel form (warm and fluffy) with a side of beer cheese dip and house made mustard.  Simple enough and yet so comforting! 

The other \"Bites\" selected was the pulled pork sliders (3 for $11). This was my favorite!! Deliciousness with the generous portion of beer braised pork in their house BBQ sauce with fried light onion ring housed in a pretzel bun. Mmmm...

Finally, pizza picking: green chili pork pizza ($10). Unfortunately, it did not have as much pork on it at all. And my lips were on fire because of all the chili or jalapeño seeds sprinkled on the pizza! So in the end I was trying hard to search for the taste of mozzarella, red onion, and especially the pork.  I think my taste buds need a break. 

Ah well next time!"}
{"text":"My grandmother & I had lunch at The Perch yesterday.  We both ordered the Prime Dip.  The meat was very fatty & looked boiled & grey.  The au juis didn't add a bit of flavor & the pretzel roll that looked tasty, didn't taste a bit like an actual pretzel.  In fact, it didn't taste like anything at all.   I let the waiter know, he took 50% off my sandwich & we agreed we'd try The Perch again. He suggested dessert, we had the blackberry cobbler... I love blackberry!!  It was incredibly disappointing. Too tart, no pastry at all, very soupy, some sort of too hard, crunchy nut (no nuts) type of sprinkle that added nothing positive. Also it was supposed to be a la mode... The ice cream was 90% melted when we finally got it.  
Love the birds..."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and the fact that they take care of all those rescued birds there is just incredible. Have been to The Perch a few times and have enjoyed myself each time. They have a great selection of beers and everything from the salads to pizza have been delicious. The Perch is somewhere I would bring people from out of town or anyone who is an animal lover."}
{"text":"I've never been so disappointed with a restaurant experience in my life. My friend took me here because she knew how much I love birds and good beer. We sat ourselves on the roof and waited nearly 15  minutes before the waitress came to take our drink order, and then another 20 before she took our food order, when we asked for water she brought one glass, then ten mins later brought another for my friend....all the while watching her help a table of older customers next to us continuously. This persisted through our whole visit. She basically ignored us for a table that she must have considered more valuable. Despite us looking 19 years old for our age, we don't have the income of one and would appreciate equal treatment. Shame on you."}
{"text":"We decided to sit upstairs at the rooftop bar...warning: not a full menu upstairs. Also no birds upstairs but it was cool to see them downstairs as we walked up, talking back to my friend Laura. Upstairs we got there early enough that there were high tables available. There were couches and lounge areas too but the open spaces looked like they had massive spills on the cushions so, no go. We ordered hummus with chicken and my friend order wine. The server was very pleasant and even happily brought out samples for my friend to taste. She decided on a white and got a healthy pour --two glasses worth! However, the food was another story...I mean it's hummus...don't they make that ahead of time?? The server came by at one point and said...\"I saw it, let me check\" and then disappeared for 10 minutes again. Finally it arrived, without the chicken. Oh well it was good...not sure I liked the cranberry add but I was so hungry at that point. We asked about the chicken, it came another 15 min later. It was good, but there was no hummus left to dip and I certainly wasn't going to order anything else...we had places to go to!"}
{"text":"Went to The Perch last Thursday to meet a friend I haven't seen in a while. I like the patio area - very cool, but since it was still pretty uncomfortable outside we headed straight into the bar area where there were still some seats left. 

The selection of craft beers here is phenomenal. If beer is your thing, this is your place. Lot's of good stuff and a wide variety to pick from. The bartenders will let you sample beers before you fully commit, and if that isn't enough the patrons sitting next to you are more than helpful. I couldn't make up my mind on what to try until the guy sitting next to me offered some suggestions that hit it out of the park.

On the food side, I like what they have going on with the menu. Since this was my first visit, I don't have a lot of recommendations other than what I ordered: The Beer Bread Burger. OMG. One of the best burgers I've had in a long time. House made beer bread, sauteed mushrooms, caramelized onions, bacon - all topped with beer cheese. 

I will definitely be back here to try some new beers and sample some more food from the kitchen. The coolest part of my visit - discovering the rooftop bar/lounge, with live music, sofas and chairs. I think I found heaven."}
{"text":"I was surprising happy with my trip here. The birds are really cool and there are some really beautiful ones.  The atmosphere is a great vibe.  Great selection of beers."}
{"text":"Really fun place to hang out!!! Bartender was amazing, servers were great and when we went outside to smoke they even came out to check on the heaters for us!! Really great management team. Love the food and wine was fabulous. Will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Most of the food was dry, cold or tasteless. Services was so slow and we needed to remind the waitress for our drinks several times. It wasn't crowded it was the wait staff spent most of the time with the loud bird. Atmosphere is the only nice thing. Not with a return trip though."}
{"text":"So this was my first time here, the ambiance of this place is fantastic! The staff was amazing, food superb and drinks were amazing! Steven (bartender) makes some of the best shots i have had in a while, and his old fashions are probably one of the best I've ever had (and I've traveled all over and that's my drink of choice). I highly highly suggest going here!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The brewer here is fantastic and friendly and more than willing to give tours.  It's always a good time at this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer!  Casual laid back vibe with a tropical feel due to all the trees and exotic birds. Makes for a nice mini escape from the Phoenix heat. Did I mention the beer..."}
{"text":"Decided to try out this restaurant on Cinco de Mayo with the wife. We arrived at about 1:00pm and it wasn't very busy, which is what we were hoping for. 

The large bird cages (hence the name Perch) is a novel idea. I heard they have really good homemade brews and had my heart set on something with peach in it.

We were sat indoors and that's where it all went bad for us. Our server (blonde with multi-colored highlights) was off in the corner having a convo with someone and didn't seem to want to be bothered with my table or the one that was there before us. There were only about 4 or 5 tables with people sitting at them so I was expecting good service.

When she took our order she had an attitude and my wife and I couldn't figure out what it was about. Maybe being \"double sat?\" (We asked to move from where the hostess originally sat us)

I've never brought this up in a review before but my wife is black and we got a real bad vibe from this server. That coupled with the fact that there wasn't another black or brown face in the whole establishment, made us uncomfortable and I wasn't about to give my hard-earned money to this server or the restaurant. I got up, found her, asked her to cancel my order and she could care less as she turned around and told the bartender not to pour my beer.

I've been in customer service for 30 years and have been a server at several restaurants as well as a restaurant manager. I'm usually VERY patient and understanding with servers because they have a very hard job!

It's probably a decent restaurant with good beer but I'll never know because I won't come back. With all the good restaurants popping up all over the Valley you can expect to find great service and food at casual dining establishments if you look hard enough! (Oregano's, Snooze AM Eatery, etc)."}
{"text":"More like 2.5 stars for food and 4 stars for the beer downstairs.

Don't come here for the food. We've been here several times and wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt before writing a review. The food is consistently mediocre at best. The beer on the other hand is pretty good, so for us we would now keep it limited to happy happy for beers.

What they call arepas are sort of like mini English muffins with a mound of dried out tasting meat with barely any cheese. It's really unfair to call them arepas as they are not close to the soft gooey delicious arepas that you can get for half the price at other places in Arizona that know Latin American food. 

Chicken Caesar salad was bland with barely any dressing on it with a burnt \"crostini\" but the  chicken was pretty good. 

The veggie burger was way over cooked and dried out with not much flavor. The tots that come with it were good.

The beers, as usual, were tasty and we like supporting local breweries.

Since there was a wait for tables downstate we went to the roof bar. The hostess mentioned it had a full bar, which is a bit misleading since it has a limited beer selection compared to the great selection downstairs. Go to the roof if you don't mind the limited beer selection, loud generic music, and people smoking around you.

Unfortunately we've been consistently disappointed with the food so this was not a one time occurrence or bad night in the kitchen from our perspective. 

For us, it's worth coming for the downstairs for beers and tots and to keep it limited to that for now on, unless the kitchen improves drastically."}
{"text":"I love this place! The birds on property are very fun to look at and gives this bar style place great atmosphere! The rooftop is fun and romantic and they have great happy hour options! They have a pretty wide selection of beer and wine but also offer cocktails for me who like the fruitier drink options! It can get quite stuffy inside - so we like to go when the weather is a little cooler and can sit outside."}
{"text":"When my friend suggested meeting at this hidden gem in Chandler I wasn't sure what to expect.  Fortunately I had gotten lost earlier in the week looking for Gangplank and found The Perch in my circling of the neighborhood, so that spared me the drama of finding it and knowing where to park when we went there.

My friend had managed to arrive early and secure a table, which probably helped with the experience of being able to walk in and be seated.  
I loved the environment and the birds and the wine, and my food.

And it would have been an \"awesome\" experience had our service been up to par (and also, had the next party not felt that their night out should take over our space both physically and verbally, crowding in on my friend & I for most of the evening).  Our server started out with high expectations - he was attentive, took our drink and food orders, and the food came out in a timely manner.

Then, it just felt like he \"disappeared\", barely checking on us afterwards, etc.  Finally I was able to place an order for Coca Cola (my favorite beverage aside from wine) & this is where it all went awry.  When the Coke came, I tried drinking it, but alas, it was Diet Coke.  I am a straight up, regular Coke drinker who hates the aftertaste of diet soda.  I tried taking a few polite sips, but just couldn't do it.  I had to finally flag the server down to ask for a replacement, upon which he became very defensive, as if I was accusing him of messing up everything and wanted to blame someone else for my soda issues.  He did not return for a while, so I asked the busboy if he could bring me a regular Coke.  Finally, both of them returned to inform me that someone had switched the lines for the diet and regular Coca Cola and if I wanted to wait, they could try to get me a regular soda.  As I sat waiting and chatting with my friend, the server returned to ask if I really wanted to actually wait for the soda, which felt a bit rude, as if he didn't really want to help me.  Now I was stuck with bad soda aftertaste and nothing to wash it down with.

Finally, after waiting almost 10 minutes, both of them returned with a new \"replacement Coke\", which still tasted of diet in both glasses, so I asked to have all removed and not put on my bill.  From this point forward, the server (beyond asking if he could drop off the bill and split the check), no longer spoke to us.  He dropped off the bill, took our cards, returned the cards, and took the signed copies without a word.  Not a \"thank you for coming\", \"sorry about the Coke\", NOTHING.  As if he no longer wanted to have anything to do with us.

Even the busboy apologized to me on our way out for the mix-up.  He almost felt like a more attentive server than the one we had, although it made me sad because the original server had started out so well.

All of that aside, I'd like to have more time to explore this place and see if the service (& soda lines) improve upon repeat??"}
{"text":"When you arrive you think are near screaming children and soon realize it is the birds - I had heard the name perch and thought fish but it is a bird aviary of some sorts. Birds every where screaming at random times but you soon forget and concentrate on why you came - the beer and the food.
So we started with the All Saints Hefe it was early and we were her for lunch save the IPAs for later. Looking over the menu we split the House made Chicken and Gnocchi soup and man was it packed with Chicken not over-powered with anything else. A little jalapeño for heat, fire roasted pepper for flavor and a little carrot for color with great flavor and almost a stew viscosity and perfect size for two to share. Then the Duck bacon burger caught our eye with brewery made Oregon St. beer cheese smothered on top with a hint of Arugula and served with flash fried gator tots a crispy golden brown. Bella our server was attentive but not intrusive did a great job. A perfect pairing and fun start to our romp in Chandler,AZ.
We will be back and maybe catch a game at the nearby park during the Cactus League!"}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere and relaxing vibe upstairs on the top patio.  The only thing I found odd is there is no burger on the menu and they took away their bomb nachos.  Otherwise, we enjoy this place. We tried grabbing local tees to rep but they ran out of several sizes and only one design."}
{"text":"This is definitely a unique place to dine.  The environment is unbeatable and the food is delicious. I will go here time and time just to see the birds and have the delicious tatertots. However, I have been here twice and the service is not excellent.  If you are in a hurry, I wouldn't recommend trying to squeeze this into your day.  But if you have the time, I would recommend coming here for the experience and scenery.  Definitely stop and say hello to Peaches"}
{"text":"We had a group of 10 and the service was terrible.   Three of us waited over 20 minutes for drinks.   Two of us had our burgers sent out wrong.   It took them three times to get my medium burger correct.  One person had to ask four times to get her ranch dressing.  I have been here before and  with bigger groups with great service.   This was the worst service I have experienced.   Additionally, half the food items were no longer offered."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch a few months ago; I really enjoyed sitting outside & hanging out with the birds. I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was so terrible. It had zero flavor & tasted like it was seasoned with water. I drenched my food in hot sauce and forced myself to eat it. My friends breakfast sandwich was delicious though. I went again around 10pm on a weekend, I had cocktails and split the specialty tater tots with cheese & bacon. That was a delicious food experience and I love the atmosphere there. I'm going to go back & have a full meal again & I'm hoping it's good."}
{"text":"A truly enjoyable experience, even if you don't like birds.

We arrived late on a Sunday, for a birthday party dinner.  There was about ten of us and we were all thirsty and hungry.  Our server was exceptionally gracious and attentive for our large group.  Food was decent for a bar, although a bit on the pricey side.

We started with the tots.  An order of Jalepeno Ranch and Buffalo Blue Cheese - both were delicious with just a hint of hot.  You must eat these tots fast, as they are tossed in the sauces, so they tend to get soggy if you let them sit.  They still taste great.

I didn't get everybody's meal, but it was mostly the fish and chips, with one green-chile pork Tamale, and one cheese pizza.  I had the Perch Burger.  This is a burger that has guacamole spread, bacon, a fried egg, Jalapeno jam and provolone cheese on a ciabatta.  At $17, you would expect something special, with attention to detail, yet my medrare order was delivered well done.  Regardless it was a tasty burger.  You get an option of sides, I went with steak fries.  The fries needed seasoning, and were improperly cooked, as they quickly got soggy.  Served with a side of catsup, I was hoping for some mayo, but the server was too busy, so I gave up and just ate them dry.  The fish and chips looked pretty spectacular, served with BBQ potato chips - although you could have them with the more traditional french fries.  People eating this were not talking, which is a good sign.

The pizza looked pretty standard and my daughter said it tasted pretty standard too.  She wasn't very impressed.

For dessert, we shared the brownie with ice cream, a cheesecake and some sort of cannoli type thing.  Everybody enjoyed that stuff too.

The real standouts here are first, the service.  We had a large, demanding group and our server took it in stride bringing out beers, food and just generally taking care of us.  Second, is the atmosphere - a garden setting surrounded by birds.  Sometimes they were a bit noisy though.  Third I would say the food.  Not really anything to brag about, but not anything to complain about either.

Yeah, I'd go back."}
{"text":"Are here over the weekend and was so impressed. We had a party of 7 which was no issue. No wait to sit when we got there at 530. The kids loved all the birds!!!  Everyone in our party had amazing food. No complaints whatsoever. The service was beyond great!!!  Highly recommend to everyone looking for a fun place downtown chandler."}
{"text":"Very neat spot to check out fun to look at the beautiful birds. Kinda switch it up. Just drinking and bar hoping. Very laid back . Would recommend"}
{"text":"This is a really cool place to get a brew and some good food.  It does get really busy on the weekends so be prepared for that.  The burger was pretty good but I really liked their tator tots the most.  My favorite brew by them thus far is the Brown Peacoat Porter.  I hope they continue to brew it!  The customer service has just been average, but it has always been really busy both times I've went."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and beer selection! 

The Tuesday pizza special is also a bonus. We got to try every pizza on the menu and loved every one of them. Their cheese board was very lack luster. Seemed like someone went to the wal-mart down the road and chopped up cheap cheese like we wouldnt notice. Overall, I would come here again."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great service and drink selection. Heads up everyone, limited menu and each one if our dinner orders was flawed (6 of us). Chicken Caesar, no cheese. Tater Tots, cold. Fries, cold. etc. etc. Food, when right- pretty ordinary. Oddly enough, we liked it due to ambience and staff. This is a 100% patio restaurant. We'll be back on a nice night, but just for the bar area."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Went for happy hour. Great beer selections. Bar maid was awesome. Food was outstanding. Will definitely"}
{"text":"One star for atmosphere but zero stars for the beer, food and the service.  Beer is simply bad homebrew, not quality craft beer. Food was greasy and you can tell that they mostly use preprepared food with very little made fresh on site.  How hard is it to mess up tater tots that are prepackaged? This place found a way. Grease pit galore.  The server seemed more interested in chatting with her coworkers than in actually working.  San Tan located a couple of blocks away is so much better."}
{"text":"This restaurant doesn't even deserve one star. Bad service and mediocre food. We waited two hours for a table. It was Friday night and there were 13 of us so I can understand the a bit of a wait. But two hrs and no one updates us. We finally get a table. The girl cleans it off and leaves. Doesn't sit us. The waiter comes to take our drink order. We say bring us appetizers as we are starving. The appetizers come pretty fast. But dinner takes forever. The food is cooked badly and not very good. I ordered a strawberry salad with grilled chicken. What I got was a limp warm salad with boiled shredded chicken. The worst thing about this experienced is we hand in our debit cards to pay. The waiter never comes back with them. After 30 min if waiting we go investigate. The cards are just sitting on the bar!! What kind of restaurant does this!! Never going back again!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The servers are friendly. The beer is excellent. I come here all of the time! My only wish is they bring back the old breakfast menu. I miss the steak and eggs and the biscuits and gravy. Still, I'm not going to let that keep me from the beer and people."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots to bring out of town guests! The outdoor experience is fantastic, and food is delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was good and a variety of drinks.. But they had ppl waiting for tables on the patio that wasn't full.. Other than that it was okay"}
{"text":"Atmosphere. Service. Comfort food selection. Of course tasty i premise brewed craft beer selection with knowledgable staff. Checkers! Roof top deck #sunsets In the dessert. Free parking. Tatter Tots! #AreYourGoinEatThoseTots"}
{"text":"I've been in love with the ambience at The Perch ever since they first opened up. I remember when this spot was a forgotten patio from eons past, that looked like it was beyond resurrection, and now it is a bird-filled happenin' downtown Chandler hotspot! My favorite part of The Perch however is the rooftop bar and lounge area, which at once feels both decadent and laid-back.

There is a bit of a secluded (or hidden) seating area towards the very back of the rooftop patio that seems like a fire exit until you explore further. This was the last spot to fill up on a crowded night, and involved forging westward past the bar to find it. It offers a great spot to grab a craft beer or cocktail and order some appetizers to enjoy Chandler's temperate weather, once the summer heat subsides and cooler nights prevail. We ordered two appetizers, the pulled pork sliders and the lobster Rangoon. Pulled pork sliders were decent, though they could have used a bit more seasoning (salt or a peppery note, or just a better dose of BBQ sauce). The lobster Rangoon, however tasty, were quite disappointing because of the portion size. Only four single-bite crispy wontons were delivered, for the inflated price of $14! Six (or better yet, eight) would be the appropriate quantity for something that pricey. A few more wonton wrappers containing a melon-ball scoop of lobster and cream cheese should not dig into their profit margins much.

So my advice is to go to The Perch for the ambience, the drinks, the view, the buzz of the crowd, but pick wisely from their menu, because some dishes are much better values than others."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend were looking for something new one night that wasn't particularly a chain restaurant and I had heard a friend mention the perch so we decided to give it a try. the atmosphere was so awesome!!!! We loved every moment of it! I can't believe I found a place so perfect for me. I mean, who doesn't love tater tots? We will most definitely be returning during colder months so we don't sweat our balls off next time :) as well as taking my friends there every excuse I have for a nice fun dinner"}
{"text":"I've been there 3 times now, I like the place very much, the beers are good and cold, I have tasted the cheese plate and it is really good and huge! For two. The restaurant menu goes down at 10 pm that is something I did not know and I had to find out when I wanted to order the duck reuben :'( oh no! So I had to comeback a weekend later during the afternoon to order it, sounds just great, duck with an egg on top over a pretzel bun, well.... They didn't have duck! :'( ... So I have not tried what I am dying to taste, hahahaaha, I'll be there for a 4th time will give them the chance :p."}
{"text":"First time here.  Big fan of this place.  Lots of beers to choose from.  Smaller than what I expected but wasn't too crowded.  The pepperoni pizza was really good and reminded me of the crust my mom used to make.  Will return soon!"}
{"text":"Spent the evening in Downtown Chandler and the Perch was by far my favorite stop! If there's space grab a seat on the rooftop terrace. World class selection of craft beers, domestic and imported. Expansive dinner menu with a delicious selection of appetizers and entrees. Enjoy the fish tacos or the wings. If beer's not your thing.. I had an expertly stirred martini. The Perch is Chandler's secret treasure!"}
{"text":"Word to the wise. If you want to eat within a decent time after ordering food DO NOT COME ON SUNDAY for breakfast and lunch. After 45 minutes waiting for food I had to flag down the waitress who was at no fault of her own overwhelmed. She explained that food was still 15-25 minutes out. Really? Come on. It wasn't even that packed. Unacceptable for a restaurant knowing they will have a sizable crown for Sunday brunch. 1 star for birds though..."}
{"text":"I just spent a punishing time at this pub for lunch!!!!!! Food mediocre, service OK Not a very large restaurant with 7 TVS and music blasting out. We were sat near the main door which was fine for the first 45 minutes, then a family came in with 5 kids and they continuously went in and out of the door yes all five of them. leaving the very large door open EVERY time. SO the 108 degree heat was horrible with the door open and top it this place has birds in cages, the birds were ok BUT the flies where terrible and because the door was continuously open we were inundated with flies. Needless to say the staff did NOTHING, just like the PARENTS who made no attempt their children from repeatedly opening and leaving open the door. I think the parents would have been better off shut in the birdcages to wilt in the heat. NOT TO BE REPEATED."}
{"text":"I personally LOVED this place.  Cool atmosphere, the birds made it fun.  I don't think I would want to sit outside though, the noise from all the birds would probably be too much!  But, the food was really, really good!  The tater tots were the best I have ever had in a restaurant, but more importantly, the Hamburger and the Mac N Cheese were fantastic.  I consider myself a bit of a Mac N Cheese connoisseur.  I almost always get it if it is served there.  Previously, my favorite Mac N Cheese was from the Capital Grille, it is a Lobster Mac N Cheese which is truly fantastic, but its expensive, and I don't really love Lobster.  I get it for the Mac N Cheese.  The Mac N Cheese is just as good (I don't want to say better) than Capital Grille's, but for a better price, without the Lobster.  I will definetly be back!"}
{"text":"The food was decent but way over priced for the proportions. My husband had the tacos and there were 2 small tacos and small salad and was $14."}
{"text":"good times. we've got live music, lots of patio seating, there are parrots on view. upstairs bar and views. its a soft opening weekend, so give the servers some time to settle in."}
{"text":"Decent food but the most horrible service i've had in years. It looks like it would be a great atmosphere so probly come back and give it another chance"}
{"text":"Food is always great here and service is better. Our waitresses have always been so friendly and helpful and make our experience amazing! Love coming here and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"Overall... Food was average, ambiance on the patio was above average, service was terrible. Very unfriendly hostess, bartender and server. They forgot 2/6 items we ordered which then came out halfway through the rest of our meal and nothing was done besides a brief initial apology Though the atmosphere was great... undecided if we will be back."}
{"text":"It took me three trips to this captive bird sanctuary/pub to be able to give this bad report. Usually when there is beer involved, poor service and mediocre food can be overlooked, but don't get fooled...the beer and food are both very middle of the road and the service is terrible. This is based on my three trips to the large bar area at lunch time where there is one person taking care of the bar and all the tables. Very slow to order very slow for refills and very slow to get food. The final straw came when the guy put in my order, completely wrong, didn't even say he was sorry for the mistake yet alone try and make it up to me. He just let me sit there while my friend ate and I waited for the kitchen to get to my order...again. The only good thing I have to say about this place is, they have a great deck but even that is hard to enjoy because of the smell of cow feed lots wafting through the town of Chandler. Smelly place!"}
{"text":"Do I have to give a star?! 
My daughter took me to The Perch for lunch. I have a broken pelvis and am in a wheelchair for 6 - 8 months. We are seated, which was a fiasco finding a seat that a wheelchair can sit at, and then getting to it. It was an adventure. Then, we ask if they have a gluten free menu. We were told that they have no gluten free options and basically was told not to eat there because the kitchen is not gluten friendly and they have flour all over because they make they're own pizza dough. The way it was presented made it sound like the kitchen was dirty. Then the manager came out and talked to me and told me that she can make basically anything gluten free. Way to save the day... lol!
They have no specialty non alcoholic drinks like homemade lemonades or specialty ice teas. I'm a little surprised cause I figured they would have that.
They also could use some upscale salads like a goat cheese, apple walnut... and the food is a little pricey for what our choices are. I hope the owner takes these reviews seriously.
Our waitress was an adorable, down to earth boho styled girl. Cute as can be!!! And she changed the channel so I can watch the Cards play. 
The bunless perch burger I ordered so it was gluten free,  was served with an onion ring on top. So, it needed to be returned and recooked. It took barely 5 minutes to fix my burger and return it to me, so I believe that I was given the same burger minus the onion ring. Which would be contaminated.
After having a nice lunch with my daughter, I decided to use the restroom before we left. I rolled into the back restroom that is posted a handicap bathroom and I had to get over the lip to get in there. Then, once my daughter pushed me in, (cause I couldn't do it by myself) she went into another bathroom and I was left inside. I tried to go into the stall with the bars, and it was way too small for a wheelchair. So I tried to turn my chair around to leave and got caught on a shelf. Then when I got unstuck and tried to get out and was stuck in the bathroom due to the bump at the door. I pushed the door open with my good foot and yelled for help and there was people who saw me, but no one came to help. Then my daughter came out of the other restroom and pushed me over the bump and into the other restroom that also has a huge bump to get over.
After using the bathroom, I was rolling to leave and I got stuck on the sidewalk and couldn't get over it. My daughter had to turn my chair around and pull me up and over. The whole time that I was struggling the hostesses just stood there and stared at us, along with other customers... no one offered help. When my daughter turned me around to get over the uneven sidewalk bump, she pulled me back and bumped back into a bench and a sign and she got hurt and still the hostesses stood there just staring. I mean we were \"right\" next to them. They didn't move to help fix the sign or to ask My daughter if she was ok... nothing!!! We were saying sorry sorry... etc... 
Then trying to leave the entrance / exit there was a sign in the middle of the walkway. I waited by the hostesses knowing they saw all this happen and I'm in a wheelchair, and can no way fit through the door with the sign there, that they would move the sign... nope... I had to ask... \"Excuse me, can you please move the sign, so, I can leave??\" The hostess walks over moves the sign and in baby talk and a huge fake smile, says,\"Have a nice day!!!\"    
Now, My daughter and I are super polite people and we were telling the hostesses how sorry we were that we bumped the sign / bench etc... They were so extremely rude, that they didn't say anything in return, at all. They just stared at us with a blank \"whatever...\" stare... Not even a polite comment like ,\"Oh that's ok... Can I help in any way? or Are you ok? or That happens a lot, don't worry...\" NOTHING!!!
I got into the car and just cried... We left and drove around the block and I said, \"No, go back... I'm gonna talk to the manager, today!!!\" 
My daughter went in and got her, Jessica, and asked her to come talk to me in the car. She  was very professional, but still, it was a horrible experience... I was so embarrassed, so sad, and those hostess girls were so rude. And shame on their parents for not teaching them manners!!! You offer help to people. If you see a customer (or anyone) struggling with something, ask them if you can help them and if you can't, get someone who can. Don't just stare, Act. Be polite.
Ps the manager apologized and said she wanted to give me a hug, and asked us to return, but never offered an incentive. We will never return to the perch... EVER!"}

The roof top bar & rescue birds make for a unique dining experience!

A gem in the heart of downtown Chandler!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars because the server, drinks & snacks were wonderful. The missing star is for the \"hostess\".

When I walked in, the hostess stand was empty. What I did see was a young lady talking to the large bird nearest the entrance. We made eye contact and then I spied a sign that said to see the bar for seating. So, I proceeded to the bar.

The 2 employees I saw in the bar appeared extremely busy and rightly so - the bar was packed. I approached a young man that was entering some orders into their POS and as I waited for him to finish up, the same bird-loving young lady from earlier walked between us & went into the kitchen area where she proceeded to get a plastic cup, use it to scoop some ice & got herself some water. I started to think she was employed by The Perch, but I didn't want to assume.

After a moment, I was able to speak to the server at the POS. I informed him that I needed a table for 4-5 and he said I could pick a table outside & he'd bring the menus out. I offered to take them w/me, but he insisted he'd bring them out. So I walked outside & took a seat at a table. Shortly after, the aforementioned young lady walked over & stood behind the hostess stand. I even witnessed her seat a patron or two. So, she DOES work at The Perch. Based on the first time I encountered her & subsequent behaviors (re: see above where she walked into the kitchen), I thought she was an entitled patron OR maybe an off-duty employee.

All in all, our server (Alberto) was wonderful and the food/drinks were great. If I went solely by first impressions, that young lady you had at the hostess stand Friday around 330-4p would have had me taking my business to another establishment immediately."}

I really want to rate them higher. The atmosphere is eclectic and loved all the seating options. Birds are loud, and noise can get overwhelming. If you are not prepared for a ruckus, don't sit close to them. 
Service was a major disappointment. Lunch was miserably slow. We ordered kids pizza (she loved it), Cuban sandwich (Hubby loved it, not a typical Cuban it had pork belly) and a half french dip with chili (it was okay). I asked for the beer menu and waiter took it back without asking if I wanted a beer, I wanted help since I'm a wino and have no clue about the beer scene, unless it's SanTan Epicenter or Fat Tire. I know, ridiculous, that's why I was hoping for a suggestion. They lost the sale, I had water. Then as lunch took over 30 minutes to prepare I was really wishing I had that beer. 

Bathrooms could be a problem, only one toilet for the men and one for the ladies. Ladies door would not close all the way and lock, it was a good thing no one needed to go while I was in there. 

Dinner was better. Hubby had fish and chips and I had fish tacos and a shot of tequila. Nothing wrong with the food or drinks, service still a bit slow. We will be back, just hoping service improves."}
{"text":"This is the best bar/restaurant in chandler.  Staff is great owners are great.  You must come and visit."}
{"text":"This was our last stop yesterday brewery hopping. I must say the place has an amazing atmosphere! From the bird cages to the lit up trees to the live music being played upstairs. The environment is what you want when you visit a brewery. Our server Bryce knew that menu like it was written on the back of his hand. (I caught too that he didn't need a note pad to take our orders. And he got everything right including my flight  beers. Impressive!) I had the Prime Rib Sandwich. It was amazing! Cooked just right... Full of flavor! My girlfriend and her mom and a Chicken Ceasar Salad which they both loved! We ended the night with a desert Bryce suggested :)  Let's just call it an amazing deep fried tortilla with cookie dough inside topped with ice cream because I can't remember the name of it. Lol Next time we're out in AZ we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I heard about the Perch from some friends and had to check it out for Sunday brunch. I'm a bird person and I'd heard this restaurant had a lot of birds which have been given up by previous owners so I was excited to see that as well. We opted to sit outside in a shady area and were greeted by our server within a few moments. I was not too hungry this day so only ordered their pretzel to snack on and a drink. I am going to start by saying that the pretzel I'd seen in some of the yelp pics looked great (large pretzel served with a cheesy sauce) but that is not what I received. Apparently they've changed it to 3 pretzel sticks served warm (ooh so good) and it came with a cold cheese dip, which was not for me. Mind you, nothing wrong with it but I didn't feel that warm pretzel and a cold cheese dip (textured like cream cheese so you have to use a knife to put on your warm pretzel) go well together, it just doesn't make sense. Our server was awesome though and got me some warm cheesey dip instead, this was wayyyy better though so if you require the same, please ask. I do feel this should be a bit clearer on the menu as well in order to avoid this happening again in the future. Now for my friend's plates they had: the pancakes which I heard were wonderfully filling. Also, the toast with avocado and eggs was delicious. My other friend ordered a skillet with eggs and sausage and said it was a nice amount, very filling and great flavors but that it was not really sausage the way she expected, apparently it was more of a different texture like smoother and no spice. I do not eat meat, so I can't say much about it but if you are expecting sausage and you order that specific dish you might be a little disappointed. Overall, I really enjoyed the feel of this brewery and think the birds have an awesome new place to call home. I wish I enjoyed beer because it seems like they have a great selection and you can always sit on the roof top and watch the sunset while having a drink, very cool indeed. As a vegetarian I don't feel there's a ton of choices to be had but it's a brewery and pub so what can you expect. I think the service was wonderful and the food was good but needs better menu descriptives. Check it out, pretty cool place to eat."}
{"text":"Well, I experienced this on a rainy day. Not the best choice, but... This place is amazing!
The patio is beautiful, you can hear the birds talking and singing, which is pretty awesome! 
I had -I don't remember how many- great beers, selection is absolutely insane. 
Staff is very friendly and welcoming. We first sit outside, before the rain goes crazy. Then we moved inside, atmosphere was so nice. 
I had the hummus, which is so good and very large for the price... 
I absolutely love that place, I'll go again and again with my boyfriend or friends or family!
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice lunch in the garden sitting among the macaws.  Enjoyed a hamberger with steak fries.  Millie had a wrap & soup.  There is a lot of trees to sit by so shade is no problem,"}
{"text":"So we were there Saturday the 11th around 2 pm and had the worst customer service. The tall skinny Hispanic server was the worst!! He did not care that we had waited over an hour to be seated. He didn't care that it was hot and he for sure didn't care that we wanted to leave."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. The staff didn't know what was on the menu. We ordered a drink, which was horrible and then went somewhere else for food."}
{"text":"The bird cages are gross. Is this a zoo or a restaurant? The beer is good. The food is good but overpriced."}
{"text":"Welp, we waited to leave a review until we visited a few times and it turns out it's consistently mediocre. Food is decent and not your normal bar food. But, the service is absolutely terrible. Our last three visits we waited at least 45 minutes after ordering to receive our dinner and two of the three times our orders were wrong. It's quite a shame because the atmosphere is great. I hope they get their act together or our next visit will most likely be our last."}
{"text":"Well after 10 years in Chandler we finally made our way to the perch. Even though the temp outside was 112 we chose to set outside with the birds and sprinklers. It was a wonderful experience. The waiter helped us decide on a beer, his suggestion was very good. We then chose from the lunch menu and was very happy with the food and service. Even though the weather was very hot we were able to set and relax with no pressure to move from the waiter.
We will be back, great place to hang out."}
{"text":"I'm just not impressed with this place, overall. If you're just looking for a different, interesting place to have beers, i guess this is an okay option... i've been here twice and both times the service has been spotty at best. This last time I had to politely ask the hostess if we had a server after 15+ minutes of just sitting there. 

As for the food... I'll pass. Bruschetta selections were just okay, and I thought were small-ish portions. My girlfriend wasn't very into her Citrus Shrimp salad, and found it oddly salty for a salad. I had the Southwest Margarita pizza, which I thought was fairly bland. I didn't taste \"hot chili infused olive oil\" and it didn't have very many tomatoes on it. Also, i know it's not in the description, but I think \"margarita pizza\" and I think basil, which this pizza has none of. Basically, it's cheese pizza with a fancy name.

Boil it down, and the only reason to come here is the patio. If you want a great outdoor place to have a beer when the weather is nice (and you're not hungry) - then go for it.  I don't think either of us feel the need to return, honestly. (and ps - didn't like with their own brewed beers either. Sorry.)"}
{"text":"What an impressive place this is. Already the moment you come in, you do not know where to look. Service is outstanding and the way the servants are busy with the birds is awesome to see. After a big hike the beer was gorgeous and the chicken wrap delicious. You must have been there once."}
{"text":"What a fun place! The birds provide another level to the eating experience. The food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a busy Sunday morning. The wait to be seated outside was about 15 minutes but no wait for inside. Server was fast and friendly. I ordered the Spanish cast iron skillet which came green chili pork and poblano hash. It was awesome. I tried my friends brick oven tamale and it was also top notch. Bar has everything you need. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I came here  for the first time a couple weeks ago for a birthday outing. It was kind of hidden but once we arrived I was pleasantly surprised by the layout. They had the front open so it intertwines with outdoor seating. They mainly had one section of the patio for open seating where there were no servers which was kinda weird. We decided to sit here anyway since the wait for a table anywhere else was long and wanted to go upstairs to the rooftop when it died down a little. In the meantime we got a couple of drinks downstairs. Their long island was made well, just enough liquor to know that it's in there since if you've had your fair share of this cocktail it easily sneaks up on you! Once we made our way upstairs I tried ordering another drink from that bar. There were at least 3 bartenders and none of them greeted me until another couple walked up behind me (I was already standing there  for about 10 minutes). The thing that irked me was that the one bartender who came to take drink orders tried getting to that couple first when I clearly was standing in front of them, not to mention standing there for quite a while. I wanted a beer but he proceeded to tell me that they only serve that downstairs. Ok....? Got a mixed drink instead. We sat down at a table up there when one cleared up and I asked our waitress about the beer. She said I could order it but it would take longer since they only have the tap downstairs. The way she said it made it seem like she was deterring me from ordering it so she didn't have to walk down there. I ordered it anyway because why does it even matter that it'll take \"longer\"? I also ordered the tater tots which were awesome! The large serving definitely fed more than 1 person that night lol. Overall this place is cool, I just didn't appreciate the customer service I received. Hopefully next time will be better!"}
{"text":"We went to The Perch last night as we were brewery hopping on a Sunday night (why not?). I had heard about this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We had already eaten and were there just to try the beer. 

First of all, this place is very unassuming from the outside. You walk up and think, \"Where am I?\" Once you walk in and see the sprawling patio with the lighted trees and bird sanctuary, it all makes a bit more sense. Super eclectic vibe and the tropical birds make it super different from any of the other breweries I have ever been to.

We went upstairs and had a flight of beers on the patio. We tried only Perch beers including the Shamma Lime-a Lime-a Gose, \"Rule All The Things\" Imperial Stout, Ginger Mofo, Lemongrass Double IPA, and the Grilled Lemon Cream Ale. My personal favorite was the Gose, as I love a good sour beer and this one was rather salty, and just different than what I am used to in a sour beer. My other favorite (and boyfriend's favorite) was the Lemongrass DIPA. The IBU content was at 98, but it didn't taste that bitter and was actually pretty refreshing. Loved the lemongrass flavor as well!

Our bartender's name was Steven (Stephen?) and he was very knowledgeable and passionate about the beer. We enjoyed talking to him and he recommended going downstairs, as they had additional beers that weren't available on tap upstairs. We were a bit tired and stuffed so we didn't make it down there to try the rest, but we know we will be back soon. He said the taps are always rotating, which makes us even more excited to see what else they have when we return!

Long story short, we loved the vibe of this place and the fact that they are the first brewery that we have seen here for the most part that is trying to do something different with their beers. Can't wait to sample more beers here and try the food!"}
{"text":"The environment and overall vibe of this place is what makes it cool. The food is good... a little pricey, and the service is kind of hit or miss, but I think the environment and atmosphere make up for that. The birds are beautiful, and the patio and rooftop bar are a great places to gather with friends and relax."}
{"text":"This place is freaking awesome. This is a great go to spot for happy hour. The ambiance, food and service is always on point! I've never been on a busy weekend night but I'm sure it would be great place for a date night or girls night out. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place because he liked the Jazz they play on Thursday. The ambiance is incredible here. It's very outdoorsy. The downstairs has plenty of birds to see and pet and the upstairs has a very lounge-ish feel. Of course, Jazz was playing that night and it really filled the room nicely.

The beer selection is pretty good and the food is very rich. Decent high quality bar food including pizza, tater tots, etc. Seating's a bit weird with their new-age chairs but overall, I'm a fan of the place.

Only thing that I didn't like was parking's a small pain. When googling it, you end up in an abandoned lot (which is ok to park at). The perch is in a dark area opposite of the mall-looking area."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Second time here.  Great service and even better food.  The perch burger tops the list.  Its beastmode good.  Great smoky sweet flavor.  I've also had the carnitas tacos anf they are great as well.  Andrew has been our server both times and he is awesome.  Full of great suggestions and reccomendations.  Its a little hidden bit well worth the hunt."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place, I enjoy the birds, the beer, the upstairs beer garden, the live music and the food! But after the three times I've been there, some one in my party has been upset or unhappy when leaving. They use the No Wait app to seat you and it always significantly longer than predicted to be seated ( I mean like 30/45 minutes longer than predicted). THEN, on the weekends they have 40 MINUTE TICKET TIMES! I'm sorry but that is just absurd!! I've worked in many restaurants at this point and this would be absolutely unacceptable at any of those places. I hope they can fix these issues because this place has lots of potential and I would love to actually have an enjoyable time there!"}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic addition to downtown Chandler- they have a super cool rooftop patio, live music and great service! The Green Chile Pork Pie was DELICIOUS! I also enjoyed the apricot beer (although it was only available in a can). 

PROS: atmosphere, food, service (you won't find many places like this in Chandler)

CONS: limited selection of draft beers, tater tots were not made in house (they were the kind you buy at the grocery store) 

Based on previous reviews, I would say the Perch is getting better. Once they bring in a bigger selection of drafts and start making their own tater tots, I'll change this to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I love to come here to look at all the birds.  They have all sorts of parrots, in cages of course. They are rescue birds and the restaurant has their own bird keepers that take very good care of them.

The restaurant is half indoors and half outdoors.  The outdoor area has lots of trees and with the addition of the mist  and parrots, I feel like I am in the tropics. There is a roof top bar/ lounge area that is kind of swanky.  It's fun to go up there at night. The food is pretty good as well. My favorite menu item are the sweet potato tater tots. 

One time I had tripped (due to my own stupidity), and scrapped up my leg pretty bad.  One of the workers ran out to his car and grabbed me some neosporin and a band-aid as well as a bag of ice from the kitchen.  I greatly appreciated that.

The one negative is that there is only one bathroom for each male and female.  You may have to wait in line for 5-10 min on a fri or sat night!"}
{"text":"The service was funny to watch: Poor Zen,running around like a chicken with no head, did not reflect his name. Working hard but had too many tables. They were kind enough to comp our drinks but we are still waiting for our mustard, a manger neglected to bring as promised...Here's the deal, we love this place...for reals...it's so fun, comfy and tasty...was just a busy day and needed more help."}
{"text":"Good food good beer and I would probably give this place a 4 or 5 if it wasn't for the crappy (crappy being an understatement) service on the rooftop bar.   Our server was as rude you can imagine and enough so that we just don't go there altogether.  Unfortunate but there are other better spots plus I would rather spend my money where it's appreciated."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, awesome roof-top deck, great beer selection and the food was ok."}
{"text":"Been here before and it was great ! Good beer and food . Went back a second time this past weekend and they refused to serve me because my passport was not AMERICAN ! Gotta say that was the worst thing the bartender couldve said to me . Spoke to the manager and he said it was in the az liquor laws that they could not take any other passport other than american . So i looked it up clearly states ANY unexpired passport is valid ID .I am Never coming back to this establishment and i will persuade any one thinking of going to not do so.."}
{"text":"Beers are good, atmosphere is nice, and service is great. Food is dry and average-tasting, so you have to smother it in their jalapeño marmalade."}
{"text":"It's a cute place, but the service is horrible. My friends and I would have stayed much longer if we had gotten our food or drinks in a reasonable amount of time, or if the servers seemed to care at all. I might try it out again in the daytime, but from other reviews, it looks like the service is this place's weakest link. The atmosphere is nice, and the two drinks I did get were strong, on the upside."}
{"text":"This place is a must try.....the birds are the attraction...the Service is not.....Food is mediocre accept for the $25 Lobster Hamburger.  OMG~!  I heard about it and I had to just try it once~!   Of course I shared it so the cost wasn't so hurtful but it was delicious~!  It does have an awesome deck. So if you just wanna new place to try with a patio that rocks than this is your spot~!"}
{"text":"We had family in town and were so excited to take them to perch for lunch on sunday april 2nd. We love that place and the food and often go there. When we went to the front to get seated the 3 hostesses said it was a 45 minute wait when (not exaggerating) half the restaurant was empty. The way they responded to us was very mean and very embarrassing considering we were taking our out of town guests to a restaurant we talked highly about. We put our name in and phone number. They texted me at 3:10 to confirm the wait. Then at 3:17 they texted me again saying out table was ready. My family did not want to wait 45 minutes and did not want to stay because of the hostesses attitudes so we walked down the block to San Tan Brewery. Where the hostesses were so welcoming and service/food was amazing. 45 mins turned into 7 mins if they would have been more accurate with the wait time and dropped the attitudes we would have loved to stay. Seems like they tried everything for guests to leave. So disappointment and embarrassed I will never go back again. San Tan brewery is so much more friendly."}
{"text":"Unique atmosphere with live birds in the outdoor patio areas. They can be a little loud sometimes, but there is always the indoor area or the upstairs lounge. Sweet potato poppers and burgers would be my recommendation for food items. People claim to like the pizzas, but I would disagree. We tried the beer sausage and beer cheese pizza which came highly recommended by the server, but I wish we would not have ordered it.

On the plus side, the spinach artichoke grilled cheese was as excellent as it sounds!"}
{"text":"This is good for beer and ambiance. They have local beers and happy hour. The food isn't great. The birds are a fun concept but can get quite loud if you're looking for a quieter atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went to the perch tonight with some out of town guests. The food was amazing as always and our server, Justin, was really attentive. He constantly checked on drinks and made sure we were happy. Definitely recommend this gem in DT Chandler."}
{"text":"This place is just adorable. A great Nite out. We had to wait about half hour for a table but it was a Friday nite & you can call 24 hours in advance to make a reservation. Did not know but will do that next time. Yes there will be a next time. We went with another couple & kind of shared because we wanted to try everything. We got the wings (sweet hot) & the pretzel as appetizers. Then for dinner we hAd a couple of orders of pork sliders, fish tacos & another order of wings. Everything was terrific! For dessert we had 2 order of their fried bread with honey & fresh berries. It was awesome. The service was terrific. I wish I could remember the waitress name. She was so pleasant & attentive. Didn't go up to the rooftop where they have music & another bar. But will go up next time. A very fun relaxing evening! Downtown Chandler has come a long way!"}
{"text":"Fun spot! The food was pretty decent and the beer selection was above average. Way above average. 

Service was great as well but we did go there at 4pm on a Thursday. No complaints."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved The Perch! Came across this place just by driving by and seeing the twinkling Christmas lights from the Main Street this place is kind of a hidden gem! The patio was wonderful there are bird cages everywhere filled with exotic birds and parrots it's really a cool place! It can be romantic or casual! The menu was so good! I was torn between a few things but I chose the tamale and was NOT disappointed!! It was incredible!! I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm so torn when it comes to this place. I went for the first time because they had my favorite beer from Flagstaff on tap and I've heard good things. The atmosphere is so cool here; Perch has misters and fans outside and loads of trees to provide shade. The unique thing about their outdoor seating is that they have birds as well, which was really neat. This would have been wonderful if the service was better. Or if I got service at all. After being taken to a table, at least three waitresses walked by and didn't acknowledge us whatsoever. After about ten minutes, my friend just went inside to the bar to get our beers. We talked and enjoyed our beer and nearly an hour later, not a single waitress stopped to even say hi, much less ask if we wanted to order food or have another beer. Not a single acknowledgement from the waitresses. This review would totally be five stars but the service just wasn't there -- literally."}
{"text":"2nd Trip here to catch the Bruins Game vs Detroit 4/26/2014 

Brought the Wife and some other friends, and everyone had a GREAT time. One my friends brought their Kids and even the kids, loved checking out all the birds... Even the crazy one that BITES...

Food Price is a little High, but you ARE getting some great FOOD... Beer prices are average.

Will be back most definitely"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! Great food, awesome atmosphere. Go here! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I'm making a point to review this place even though I didn't even get to eat here. The Perch had been sitting in my bookmarks for quite some time as it seemed like a cool concept to me (eating amongst the birds and games to play, where's the bad in that?), so my SO and I trekked out to Chandler to check it out on a lazy Sunday afternoon. When we got here, we thought the place was closed because there was a lot of construction, so we called and they said to just walk right through since they actually were open. We went into the enclosure where the ambiance is very tropical and shaded. There are many birds making noise and this place was amazing as far as decor. They have a separate game area and a greenhouse-type building where an event was being held. We went to the hostess who seemed irritated or annoyed, she asked how many were in our party, we responded two, and she mumbled something about \"having to check and see if her server could do it...\"*faded off and walked away*. We shrugged and figured they might be understaffed...even if there were maybe only 10 people seated and plenty of open tables. We roamed around, but stayed close enough to the hostess booth so that she would still see us. We did this for about 10 minutes, when two women came in and asked to be seated, they were immediately seated by the same girl in a nice area under the trees. Now we were confused...we walked over to the hostess and she asked rudely if we were \"ready now\". She seemed sheepish, like she knew she done goofed, and she seated us at a dusty and crooked table right behind where the kitchen door swings open and in direct sunlight. We were embarrassed and completely over this place, the only good experience was seeing the birds. But we simply got up and left, deciding not to give money to an establishment that doesn't even care about the customer experience..."}
{"text":"We arrived at the Pirch with our 12 month old baby and we were very excited with all the birds that they have and the beautiful PHOENIX day. We arrived at 12:50pm and we were seated at 1:15pm. It was a little bit of a wait which is to be expected with the outdoor seating. We ordered our food and we sat and watched two tables that arrived after us get their food before us. Our waiter them came over and said \"we had a little bit of a hiccup in the kitchen.\" I asked to speak with a manager and asked does the hiccup allow prices that came in after us to get their food before us. He said it depends on what you ordered. I said, I ordered a salad! He said he would check on the food and take care of the bill. The reason they got two starts is because he took care of the bill. Otherwise, no apology for our wait, no apology for anything, they would have gotten 1 star. We didn't even get to taste the food yet because we got it to go. Our baby was so tired! What the male manager, I can't remember his name but he worked Sunday 4/2/17 at 2pm manager did not seems to realize was that it was not about the food being covered it was about acknowledging our wait time, people coming in after us and getting food before us and the fact that we missed out on enjoining the scenery and our family time! Poor management at its best!"}
{"text":"Mixed reviews here. Food has generally been good, service ranges from great to last time seemed like I was bothering them. Prices a little high. Cool bar and rooftop is chill. Ill try again"}
{"text":"I am impressed.  Phenomenal service despite being busy on a Saturday night.   Tamales were excellent,  just the right amount of spice.  Great beers, and I  really like the 5 oz  pour options.   I'll be back (said with my best Arnie voice)."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast/brunch places. It's seriously a little oasis in this hot desert of ours.... The restaurant doubles as a bird sanctuary so while your dining outside, you're surrounded by lush trees and the chirps of birds. The atmosphere reminds me of vacationing in Honduras and Belize, which is why I continue to come back. The food is to die for. I usually hate going out to breakfast because every breakfast place has the same tasting food, but the perch is different. The presentation is great, food is amazing, and there is a wide variety for you to choose from. 

Only drawback... The service is horrible. I always try to order my food and drinks at the same time to avoid having to wait 10 years to order my food. Sometimes the coffee comes out cold, but if you ask nicely, the waitresses are more than happy to make you a fresh pot. The staff is young and that's probably why the service is slow. But, if you can overlook the slow service, this place will become one of your favorites."}
{"text":"3.5. The food was good and the hummus happy hour serving is a good. I thought the beer was just average and that's why I'm giving it a 3.5. There's better beer in the valley."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the upstairs patio. I was happy to not be forced into the family atmo since I do not like others kids. Lol the goat cheese and herb tater tots were delicious. The min I saw them on the menu I knew they would be good. There was no rush for the bill even when they were super busy and that customer service was much appreciated. They saw my girlfriend and I having a good time and let us be. Refilling drinks and asking if we needed anything but no awkward rush for the bill and I liked that ;)."}
{"text":"We thought With the nice weather we would go to the Perch and sit outside. We have been there several times before and had good service, we sat for almost 25 minutes today and not one person came and asked to take our order.  We ended up getting up and leaving. Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"Food is just OK.  Atmosphere is interesting and the birds are kind of weird for my taste. Upper deck kind of cool and sometimes have live music. There are a lot of choices in downtown chandler for food and drinks and I would rate this as below the average probably because the food was pretty mediocre. It is unique in some ways and could be much better if they worked harder on the food."}
{"text":"The brunch tacos were so freaking good. Tacos sometimes lack taste, but these pack awesome flavor."}
{"text":"Food was okay, not really a big portion for the price. The birds were really cool, but definitely loud and a bit difficult at times to have a conversation. It was a fun atmosphere with the birds and cool restaurant and bar layout."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great. Service was excellent. The food needs work though. I had mac & cheese with sausage. Mac and cheese was dry and the sausage was over cooked, dry and just thrown on top. It's mac and  CHEESE. where was the cheese?"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Best rooftop view amazing food, amazing drinks! Best time all around!"}
{"text":"This place is lovely, delicious and friendly! 

It's a really neat place for lunch , or dinner . 
(Breakfast menu looks great too).

The staff is GREAT! They're on top of it! I definitely rate their staff a 10 star. 

Their food was also delicious!

Great prices, and an awesome view. 

The birds chirping are a PLUS, it makes it very relaxing to eat."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night dinner and a few drinks. My rum and diet coke was weak and flat...I even returned it and asked it be redone with regular coke hoping I'd get a little fizz but it was flat still. I ordered wings and they were dry from being way over cooked also had a side ceasar salad and the dressing tastes like mayo. My boyfriend had much better luck then I did, he got the prime dip sandwich and it was good. Service was really slow and our waiter forgot a few things...  The ambiance of this place is really awesome. The birds and outside seating are definitely what sets this place above others."}
{"text":"Right when you walk in, you are greeted by Amazon Parrots. Hands down the coolest thing ever! Giant Checker and Chess boards, beautiful decor, and friendly staff. Our bartender Brandon was such an awesome host, made recommendations, and always made sure we had everything we needed! The rooftop bar plus a nice Arizona Spring afternoon was a great combination!  The photos of the food we had speak for them selves. Will be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"I love love love the perch E at the bar downstairs is amazing!  They have a diverse selection of beers and there pub bites are really good!! Go pay him a visit and tell him Steph sent you!!"}
{"text":"WOW hidden treasure! A-MAZE-ING beer selection!  The Perch brews are comparable to AZ Wilderness' craftsmanship towards the lighter palates. Craft beer lovers..this is must see!  Thanks Josh for the fantastic service!!  Brad & Monica 

 Great for fresh air brunch with Mom to day time drinking with friends. Anything goes at this open laid back venue. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for a casual night out with my husband.  We wanted to go early before it got crowded.  We got there around 5:30 and went to the bar upstairs.  There was a good amount of people up there yet there was still several open places to sit.  Upstairs it is seat yourself.  I had been reading the reviews on here and saw a few that gave bad reviews for poor service so I was nervous.  However, we were greeted in a fair amount of time and placed our drink order.   I wanted a beer and am not adventurous with beer so I ordered a Bud Light.  I wasn't asked if I wanted it on tap or in a can.  I assumed it would come in a glass.  However I was delivered a can.  Kind of different but it was fine with me.  My husband ordered a peach iced tea.  It was sweetened and he felt it was too sweet, though.  The menu was interesting.  There were a lot of items that did not appeal to me but a few that did and the prices seemed very reasonable.  I ordered the spinach artichoke grilled cheese sandwich that comes with tater tots.  He ordered the  beer sausage pizza.  I enjoyed the sandwich very much.  He liked the pizza fine but didn't think it was anything special.  Our server was very very low key, not much of a personality but he did the job and I don't have any complaints regarding service.  As the sun went down it started to get much busier.  It's definitely a hotspot for young-middle age crowd.  Not really a young crowd but that may change as the evening goes on.  We left by 6:30.  We enjoyed hanging out and enjoying the atmosphere.  It is a cool place.  Downstairs looked nice too and would be a fun place to go with the kids.  The birds were fun to watch down there.  My only complaint for the night was that people are allowed to smoke up there so every once in a while we got a whiff of the smoke.  It wasn't that bad...could have been worse.  
There was music playing and we were right by the speakers.  It was the perfect level...loud that it drowned out the other conversations but not too loud that we  couldn't hear each other.
I would definitely go back... it is a cool atmosphere and would be fun to go to with a group or girls night out."}
{"text":"I've been twice...once we were upstairs in the bar for dinner and drinks, and once was downstairs for lunch with my parents and sister.  I really enjoyed it both times.  Really great atmosphere, especially downstairs...it's as though you're eating lunch in a park filled with trees.  Upstairs was a little different, atmosphere wise...it was almost like it was Craigslist Hookup night...lots of \"older\" men with much muuuuuuch younger women that were clearly on first dates...And it was every single table!  We looked around and laughed that we must have missed the Hook Up memo.  But the beer is fantastic...the Rosemary IPA is outstanding.  The food was great.  I really enjoy it there...but for sure I'll stay downstairs next time!"}
{"text":"I go here regularly for the brunch and it's one of my all time favorites - the skillets are so good! Go to brunch spot for me."}
{"text":"I love this place! We did a brewery tour for my bday and this was my favorite stop! We were late for our reservation but they were curtious and accommodating. The beers and presentation were perfect, and of course I love the exotic birds! Some of them even chimed in to sing Happy birthday to me! So special!!"}
{"text":"I have read the reviews and the ones that are bad are just plain stupid. If you know how restaurants work and are not a complete pompous jerk. You'd find this place awesome! I stumbled upon it by accident and live right by. I came in for lunch the first time and sat at the bar. Bartender was friendly and food was great! I really like the atmosphere and open area. If you have a clue and understand the bar tables are part of host seating and not open you'd get why they may be open. I've tried the prime rib dip and the chicken caesar. Both were above average than most places. I'm not rich but I'm also not a cheapskate. I found the pricing more than appropriate. As for the birds. If you don't like birds.... Don't go to a place called \"the perch\". I'm indifferent about birds but birds are animals and they poop pee and squawk. You know, cause they're birds! I love this place and like the simple menu, and relaxing garden feel"}
{"text":"The Perch is one of my favs. Good beer, good food and a very unique atmosphere. I visit this place frequently to the point where I received a gift card as a wedding gift! 

The MAC Shack is great, you can really customize it and make it your own. Last time we added jalapeños and pulled pork and it was amazing! The tacos  and regular burger is great too. We haven't gone wrong in the last FIVE visits. Definitely recommended.

FYI - if you're scared of birds... may not want to stop by they're everywhere. They are in cages and you can eat inside as well. You should be good!"}
{"text":"I used to love the perch...not anymore.
They have invested well over $1M to make this place great.  But what they are succeeding at is being a bully to the small business that they shared a courtyard with.  
The Perch fenced Yolis off from customer egress with little to no notice.  Super crappy thing to do to a family that is just trying to support themselves.  

If they were doing it for your liquor license as they claimed...I'm sure they could of given notice, filed for permits, put in a gate or just worked with Yolis.  This is just picking on the little guy and maliciously trying to hurt there small business. 
The perch has ZERO class and will get NONE of my business after pulling that crap.  

Greed is NOT Good!"}
{"text":"Tonight, my boyfriend and I visited the Perch out of recommendation from his brother in law. It was a bit nippy out when we got to this joint around 8 PM. Little did we know that we would have to travel through dark streets in pursuit of this place. It is the only lighted area within the shadows LOL and it's a bit south of most downtown eateries. Anyway, we walk up and decide to sit on the rooftop bar (awesome! So much yas). On the way to the stairs, there are cages of so many different birds (They cleverly named their joint in respect to this... Brownie points). Apparently they save all of these birds, and let me tell you, there were so many! So that's pretty cool of this establishment to begin with. I did worry that the little dudes were cold in this weather, however. Do birds get cold?
So we sit at the bar upstairs. There are heaters distributed since it is in fact cold as balls. I luckily sat directly underneath a heater. Boyfriend and I order a round of beers (I had the blonde by Perch and he had the amber by Perch). Both were yummy. The Amber had a bit more hops which increases the bitter after taste. 
The bartenders were really awesome. Their names are Steven and Carol (I think?). I ordered the prime rib and boyfriend ordered the Reuben. They both came with tater tots. What a pleasant surprise since we both love some taters. My prime rib was yummy and I'm pretty sure boyfriend enjoyed his Reuben. 
Oh, and there was live music! I didn't get the gals name, but her voice was beautiful. Don't forget to tip those providing live entertainment, as well!!! 

Overall, great vibe (a little hipster-y) and super cool rooftop area. It's all lit up with lights and is generally an awesome spot for food and drinks. Try it, fellow yelpers."}
{"text":"Great armosphere! A must-visit for out of town guests on a mild weather day in the shade! I wish the bird stories were made into laminated readables to keep on the tables with the bird rescue highlighted for entertainment sake! The birds are the best part of this aviary inspired food and drink spot. The food was good but not great (French Dip) but we will return again for the atmosphere for sure! A neat, different eat-out!"}
{"text":"Loved:  atmosphere, location, food
First time I have been to the Perch. Very very cool location and vibe. The rooftop was an amazing  atmosphere and even though it was still 104 outside it was very comfortable. Hummus plate was great!

Not so much:
The bartenders were complete amateur especially since I was so impressed with everything else the place has to offer. When I asked about the types of beer they had he offered me a 1/4oz taste and walked away never to return. The other bartender seemed as if he had just smoked a joint and couldn't even hold a thought long enough to comprehend what I was ordering. 
Pretty disappointing. 

I will be back because this place has so much to offer, but I feel like it stops short just a bit with the actions of the bartenders."}
{"text":"This is a good place, that I normally have great service at. Except for last night. We looked on google for the hours and it said that the perch was open until 1am. We then went into the bar area around midnight and we were ignored. When asking one of the waitresses if they were still open she said they took last call about 20 minutes ago. (Which is fine). My friend that I was with said, \"Google said you're open until 1am.\" And the waitress said \"well we don't control Google\". What a terrible attitude to have and to be rude when asking why your hours differed from Google. I won't be coming back if you can't even update your hours and then are absolutely rude about it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great daytime or evening. Can't say much for the food since I haven't loved anything I've ordered from salad, to tacos or burgers. The house cab is great and so is  the new fashioned. I suggest it just for drinks."}
{"text":"Holy Buckets!!!!! This place is amazing! Brought our beautiful daughter out for date night and she chose this awesome place! We had the brick oven Mac and cheese, the duck bacon burger and the cheddar burger. Couldn't have asked for better food, everything was extremely fresh and cooked to perfection!! The ambiance was incredible! Loved the birds. Loved the outdoor seating with the greenery and lights. Loved everything about this place! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were the first customers to try the Sin City Burger.. It was the best burger I ever had, no lie.. Prime Rib and Lobster and Asparagus.. there was a side of gold flecked tater tots and we added Garlic herb and goat cheese.. we also got a side of the spinach artichoke, which I added to the burger and dipped the tots in it..The weather beautiful, the birds a chirpin.. and some low key music.. great staff.. CAN'T WAIT to come back..."}
{"text":"I came to the Perch for a friend's party and I must say the space is so cute! I love the birds and the outdoor seating. The bathrooms (fashioned to look like outhouses on the outside) are adorable. The service was good, though there were long wait times for food considering there were many large parties. For food, the husband and I shared the fried chicken bbq pizza with no ranch, it was decent, but nothing terribly special. The house brewed beer was good, I had the saison and enjoyed it very much. I wouldn't come here regularly, as it is very far from my house, but I would return if I were in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Not happy at all, walked in thinking this was like red lobster and started looking at the birds.  Found the one that looked good and meaty, then they tell me you can't eat the birds... Bummer. Their beer cheese soup was good.  Now if someone could make a cross between red lobster and Buffalo Wild Wings, that would be great. Watch the server run around and try to catch chickens to eat."}
{"text":"Awesome spot to come eat. You can sit outside with the birds or stay cool inside.  They also have a mini rooftop to eat on which is pretty neat.  They make their own beer and is pretty dam good all styles.  Highly recommend it here"}
{"text":"We love this place. The atmosphere is great and the food is as well. The only incident we had was that when we had called in to inquire about gluten-free food for somebody with celiac's disease, we had been told that they did have gluten-free options which is not the case. They do have a gluten-free pizza however it's not cooked separately so it's not truly gluten-free.  UPDATE: I got a message from the management team to let me know that they have now trained their staff to say \"gluten friendly\" instead of gluten-free. I appreciate them taking some action."}
{"text":"Very good Berger cool staff, bird is psychotic, but the food and chill atmosphere is a plus."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere of this place. The food was decently priced and very delicious! The server was kinda meh but it didn't ruin the experience. I will be going back."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place, so badly that I gave them 3 tries and each time was worse than the first. The atmosphere is great outside with trees, exotic birds and good music byt that's where it stops.  The menu is limited and is average at best.  If you are GF your are up a creek.  And the servers are horrible.  All 3 times they just couldn't serve to save their lives.  Everything took forever they would forget to bring something everytime and it took forever to get our food.  Keep in mind that it wasn't even that busy.  If I were you I would head over to San Tan."}
{"text":"Just realized I hadn't written a review about this place yet. This place is such a great concept- love the atmosphere with all the foliage and the bird rescue aspect is awesome. Rooftop patio is super cool, although I'll be avoiding for the next few months it now that summer is here! But when we get to fall- that's where I can be found :) I have enjoyed my meals there, particularly the last time. The bartender was amazing, stopped in for lunch and he really made the experience great- whether it be samples of beer or recommednations off the menu or even offering to customize my burger so that's it's just perfect for me. I'll be back again and soon!"}
{"text":"Really liked the place. The staff were great very friendly and provided great service. The menu is limited but the few originals they have on there are pretty darn good. We had the ravioli and Tamale dishes. Drinks ok a bit pricey. The birds are cool I wonder if they hate all the noise. The upstairs bar was too too too crowded. There is a 8 inch path through the crowd to pass and there is the one douche who must stand in the middle twisting her hair. I'm so cute .....wrong and move it please. The bathrooms were inconvenient and kinda dirty could use some upgrades for facilities. The men's room overflowed and the guys were walking through the mess. Ummm....yuck. We would return because we loved the staff and the food but it would be nice to see them get the bar in a much more functional state, sort out the restroom facilities. Also the dirt lot for parking was a bummer but it's the only game in town if you have a car.  I would recommend the experience."}
{"text":"I tried the pork wings and a side salad.  My server, Bailey,  was quick and made sure I was well taken care of.  The food was awesome. 
My only complaint is the loud, disrespectful rap music coming from the upstairs area.  Most of the restaurant is outside and is a bird aviary.   You don't notice the heat because they are blowing water mist and have lots of fans.
I sat in the middle outside the bar area.  There was very pleasant music playing down in the dining area but it was often drowned out by obnoxious rap music.
I was here at 9:00pm on a Sunday night and don't see the need for the blaring rap music.
Unfortunately,  I can't recommend this restaurant and I won't be back.  I feel bad for all the birds that have to listen to that crap."}
{"text":"What a wonderful patio restaurant.  The kids love it here.  There are birds everywhere! The food has been very good overall.  Their mac n cheese is absolutely delicious.  We tried a couple of their desserts too and were very pleased.  

We have been a few times and found that service is slow and we have issues with order accuracy at the table."}
{"text":"1st time I went here because the wait at YOLIS next door was too long...so the pERCH it was. We shared a burger- which was okay. Went back with some friends last weekend and it was a NIGHTMARE! We waited 15 min before being greeted, we were never offered seating and we saw a ton of open tables. We seated ourselves... we ended up walking up to the bar to order our food because nobody ever came to serve us. 40 min in, we were already sitting down eating a young girl comes over to our table and says we are going to have to move because there is a group w/ 1 more person than us that needs our table. I looked at her with crazy eyes & said, Um we are not moving, we are almost done eating & we waited forever already. I get it , she was young & seriously lacked any customer service / service skills. We ended up not having to move, but we were pretty upset about it.  I had ordered the fish tacos...DO NOT ORDER THEM!!! disgusting!!! the breading was mushy & falling apart and the flavor was gross! My hubby had ordered a french dip w/ no mushrooms and no horsey sauce- they brought it to the table the 1st time xtra mushrooms & extra sauce! even when it was made to orderright it came out cold! at that point he said, I am NOT eating this, just take it off of my bill. The waiter/bartender looked at us dumbfounded as if we should pay for something we ordered that we were NOT eating! i will NEVER go back here again- the service sucks!  I heard the owner of this place owns the bar next to it (i cant remember the name )CHicago something??? anyways, I had a better dinner at mcdonalds that night & better service too!! dont waste your time or money... if you want to see the birds w/ your kids, just walk thru with them and then leave!!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to love it.  The birds are cool and I was really hoping to get to watch the big, loud blue macaw bite one of the unattended little brats who kept rattling his cage.  My husband enjoyed his Russian Influence Imperial Stout, and the Perch Mule was on point.  Rebecca's Caprese sounded intriguing, but the fried green tomatoes weren't tangy.  That app could've been great but wasn't.  The balsamic on it was really good and the little heirloom tomatoes were tasty.   We waited a LONG time for our entrees.  I had the porcini truffle ravioli and it was good.  The filling was tasty, too bad one of my ravioli was empty.  The alfredo sauce was good and it's a rare restaurant that pulls off an alfredo sauce I like.  The garlic bread was delicious.  My husband had the the DP pizza and it was good, but half of it was underbaked.  We decided to have dessert, and the most attractive choice was an Oreo cheesecake.  OMG, disappointing doesn't begin to describe it.  A good cheesecake is not difficult to make, and while I prefer New York style, I know cream style exists.  This was neither.  The texture was extremely weird, and my husband said he thought they had used gelatin in the filling.  Whatever it was, don't waste your money because the flavor was okay but certainly didn't make up for the alien texture.  The raspberry sauce on the plate was delicious, best part of the whole dish.  We agree with other reviewers as well that the portion sizes are small for the prices.  Too bad, but we probably won't be back.  To end on a high note, our server Marissa was lovely and earned a good tip."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service was really bad. Had to look for a waiter after 20 mins. After ordering waiter came back and said they didn't have the house pasta. So I ordered something else. Want to order veggie cake but they also didn't have it. Ended up ordering tacos. Food was reasonable. Service was bad. When we asked the waiter to split the check. He charged 2 transaction to the same credit card so they have to void the transaction. Didnt see a restaurant manager anywhere or maybe he/she just sat in the bar. Overall bad service. Also a friend of mine got bitten by the bird. She took a picture with friends and her arm was just outside the cage. The bird bit her really hard. Technically she could sue the restaurant because of this. Avoid and find somewhere else. By far worst restaurant ever."}
{"text":"Stopped in around 4pm yesterday (Sat.)...crazy entrance but finally found the inside. This is an outdoor restaurant with limited indoor seating. We sat inside because of the 110+ degree day. 
Loved the beer cheese and bacon tator tots, will be back just for those alone!! I had the mac and cheese with grilled chicken and bf had a monster sized burger. Waffle fries left a little to be desired (definitely overcooked).
Again will be back, for the outdoor aviary experience, in October (vs June)"}
{"text":"The rating and review is based on the drink/food at the roof top bar. It started out nice with great weather and an optimistic outlook for the upcoming beverage.

Atmosphere - I enjoyed the high top we chose while those sitting on the wet couches (recent rain) did not. There were two big negatives up there - 1) Smoking. Be aware, the roof top bar is a full smoking location including cigars, and they were everywhere, and 2) Music, it was loud Electronica, completely out of place for the atmosphere and completely annoying. The music alone is a reason not to go back to the roof top bar.

Service - Slow, nice, but slow. It took 15 min to get the first beer.

Food - We tried a couple of items. The meat & cheese board was ok, a little light on the meat and not at a high level but ok. The pig wings were good, I'd order again but I'd ask them to go easy seasoning.

Beer - A little disappointing on the draft options of house beer. I had two, IPA and Flocktoberfest, and found them lacking depth.

I'll go back to try the outdoor patio which look inviting and a little quieter. The overall menu has interesting options so we'll see if the service is better down there."}
{"text":"Finally!  Joyce W. has found her way to The Perch and she needed a Strawberry beer!  After blowing past this place like a crazy lady and nearly missing the parking lot, I made it here and it was like stepping into Wonderland [minus the LSD.  Stay drug-free, kiddies].  

Our waitress was a sweetie and walked us to our bar seating slowly since I was obviously too mesmerized by all the chirping birds.  Being that I had planned this outing earlier in the week, I already knew I wanted a Fruili Strawberry beer while Mr. W. had a Perch Rosemary IPA to start and we also got some Oyster Shooters [That mango lime one is sooo amazing, the lemon horseradish is good, and the sundried tomato with orange and garlic is decent --- all of them sweet, briney, and mild!] and a Mini Tots Poutine.  It was a pretty decent day out so it wasn't too warm or muggy but after draining half our beers, I was getting thirsty.  We had originally wanted to grab some real food but the warming beer and the gravy and cheese tots were getting to us.  We opted on passing on \"real\" food although the smell of pizza coming from the table next to us was tempting.  Oh, we also tried the Perch Cucumber-something as recommended from our waitress.  It was oddly refreshing!

Although the beer is on the pricier side, it's always nice to support our local businesses.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My co-worker ordered a pretzel from here and it had mold all over it. Stay away from this place, their food is obviously far from being fresh."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon, not busy. Sign says seat yourself. Sat on the patio for 10 minutes-not even a glance in our direction. Won't be back."}
{"text":"So the food was alright. Nothing amazing. I had the eggs Benedict which is what I get every time we try a new place for breakfast. They definitely give you a lot. More than one person should eat so their not stingy.  Service was horrible, we got there at 9am right when they open and were the second guest to be seated. We didn't get our food till 45 minutes later and my daughter's biscuits and gravy were cold. I definitely won't go back for the food maybe only for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"After all of the bad reviews I read on here, honestly, I went just to see how bad it was. Luckily for me, it was pretty nice. However; I went on a Tuesday, in the afternoon and hardly anyone was there. I also hung out at the bar, not upstairs. So here's what I think about my experience. The bartender was a friendly, chatty readhead and she was attentive to us. She helped us remember when happy hour was about to start so we could take advantage of the specials. The food was amazing. We shared a beer board which consisted of beer sausage, beer cheese spread and beer bread. A little on the bland side but pretty good. After our Guinnesses (which they have on tap. Thank you!) we had their specialty drink called Jamie's Boone. Served in little copper cups, it's basically Jameson with ginger beer and crushed mint leaves. Yum!! My boyfriend had the green chili pulled pork and I had the smokehouse burger. The rooftop is a nice idea but you can already see where the sun and weather has worn things like chairs and cushions. Don't know how many people would really be up there from May-September, but hey, I guess if you're trying to be a trendy hot spot (ahem, it's not Downtown Phoenix, but ok) you gotta have a \"rooftop bar\" Whatevs. One other bartender was kind of friendly and talked to us, but the servers seemed to lack enthusiasm and didn't have much going in the outgoing department.  Overall, really cool place to hang out. There weren't many people there so I can't attest for how douchey it may get on the weekends. I knew where this place was but if you are not familiar with Downtown Chandler, you WILL have a hard time finding it. Best bet is to park where you think it is and just start walking around. Good luck!"}
{"text":"What a great little spot! You can sit out on the patio and eat a delicious meal amongst an awesome collection of birds! Some of them talk as well. They were pretty busy this afternoon so the bartender came out from behind the bar and up on the patio to take care of us. She was super friendly and as a first timer, she guided me through the menu and helped us with our order. We had the meat and cheese board which isnt worth $25 but is half off today (Wed) and was definitely worth that. Hummus was hummus but very good. Fresh veggies and pita pieces were on the side of the hummus. The boys got pretzel bites and a kid burger which was a slider and the smoked gouda mac n cheese. It was such a beautiful day out to sit on the patio and we totally enjoyed our experience!"}
{"text":"We have been trying to like the perch.  Trying really really hard to like this place.  Today we walked in to an empty patio, and the brilliant hostess sat us in the sun.  Their food is going downhill, their beer quality sucks, and the employees are clueless!  Please close down so a decent owner can take over!  You give downtown chandler a bad name."}
{"text":"This is a unique bar/grill in downtown Chandler. Most seating is outdoors with plenty of tree-provided shade on the ground level and sunshades on the roof. I had the clam chowder in a bread bowl. Great soup and even better bread. My friend had the personal pizza -- also very good. 

The happy hour service was very good with 3 of the waitstaff just on the roof. Compared to previous reviews, it seems like they really improved in that area. 

Parking can be difficult but this is true of the area in general. After dining or drinking, it's a short walk to anyplace else downtown. 

Because it is mostly outdoors, it may be a bit warm during the heat of summer but for spring, it's great!"}
{"text":"Great beer, good fun food. The service is a bit slow so plan to sit and chat for awhile. The place is cute but sometimes the squawking gets annoying"}
{"text":"5 stars for the beer and servers
3.75 stars for the ambiance
1 star for MOST of the food. 

Food - I love the beer selection. I had an amazing IPA and even more amazing oysters shooters (if you do 1 thing right here...do this). The rest of the food is all throw away items. Nothing is terribly flavorful or made very well, which is a real shame. They should probably revamp themselves as a cocktail lounge/bar, limiting their food options, as they may do better. I would also really recommend picking up a recipe book and making 5 to 10 items really well. Take a page from Gordon Ramsay Kitchen Nightmares.

Ambiance - Beautiful AZ patio restaurant. The greenery and birds are lovely touches. However, limited seating downstairs with choices under dripping misters or a sand pit.

Hope they read the reviews, address the outdoor seating and tighten up their food game."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our kids to The Perch to eat lunch to celebrate our son's 6th birthday. We sat outside in 100 degree weather and it wasn't bad at all. They had fans and misters going. The servers were all very nice. One gal even brought oranges out for my son to feed the birds. The bathroom was really cool too. There were inspirational sayings written on the walls. They also had a can with a pen and sticky notes to make a wish and pin up on the walls. Pretty appropriate for his birthday I'd say. Anyway we had a great experience here. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great ambience and great beer! The birds are great.  The food unfortunately just doesn't measure up.  The descriptions on the menu get you really psyched up.  It comes to your table looking amazing.  But then you taste it and it has no flavor.  I want to love this place. come on Perch get some flavor in the food.  you have so much potential!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to love the perch! That is where we had our first date. But the last two experiences left us sad and disappointed. They say they are dog friendly, but there is nothing friendly when you bring your dog. When I had called and asked, the hostess was clearly annoyed that she had to say yes they were dog friendly...We went anyways. Bad mistake. We get there and both hostesses were rude. They had said there was a 30-35 min wait. (Open tables everywhere). We decided to walk downtown while we wait and within 5 mins we get a text. We turn back, and she puts us in the very back nasty corner of the restaurant with a crooked table. After NO service and poor service we left and will never go back. Too bad. And no The Perch is not \"dog friendly\"."}
{"text":"Such a cool little spot. Took my daughter (near 4 yrs old) so if you do the same, be prepared to walk the entire time. Checking out the birds can really monopolize your evening.  

Tips:
1. go during happy hour
2. Order what's on the happy hour menu
3. Drunk lots of beer 
4. Try everything
5. Order the smothered tots
6. Order a board 
7. Check out every bird 
8. Enjoy yourself
9. Go potty

The perch has been a little secret in chandler for a while now, the restaurant right next door is much less known so if they're packed dine next door and come over for a beer. It's an experience worth having. 

Lastly, use the restrooms. It's just fun. Living in arizona a lifetime, places with outdoor living spaces entice me, some places just make you feel a world away like your on safari or in a jungle."}
{"text":"The idea of this place is great - the birds are amazing and it has a great ambiance. Unfortunately, the food, service and beer leave a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Love this Place!!  1st time there last night. Food, service and music was all exceptional. I will be heading back there for sure."}
{"text":"I went on a busy Saturday night on the rooftop. The atmosphere was nice and the misters made the heat bearable. The tater tots with goat cheese were delicious. The service wasn't great but they were really busy so I'm not as bothered by it. I'd definitely go again for a chill night out."}
{"text":"Had heard about The Perch and so I was pretty excited to finally make my way.  Have to say- it just may be one of my new favorite destinations just for the atmosphere alone.  

You know those places you see on TV shows where couples are out for a nice dinner and there are all of those beautiful globe lights hanging from the trees?  Thats how this place looks when you walk in through the main entrance. My husband and I just went for drinks - but we definitely plan on going again soon so that we can give the menu a try.   The setting is very casual and the menu seems to offer the basic american type cuisine.  

There are two bar areas- one upstairs and one down. Definitely a nice weather spot because- for the most part- all spaces are outside, except the downstairs bar.   The upstairs bar area had tons of couches and patio heaters located all throughout which added to the ambiance. The night we were there both bar areas were packed. 

Overall, seems to be a really great place to go grab a meal or drinks under the stars and just enjoy the evening."}
{"text":"Let's be honest. The spread of 1 stars and 5 stars on The Perch is common for a new establishment. The 1 stars here dwell on the opportunities (service deficiencies) and lack any celebration of great service. Any place will have it's balance of these and it's own speed bumps early on, so ease up. 

As a mystery shopper, I can attest that The Perch has a fantastic atmosphere, great staff, and an overall delivery model that is unique and classy - definitely a GREAT touch for the DC area. There is honest opportunity present with the staff learning the changing menu; I've been here a number of times and have seen it updated. This is common and expected, but it would behoove the staff to be briefed on the changes. 

The food was great and on reading other reviews about the food, service, or cleaniness, I can't really see where they're coming from. The Perch isn't filthy nor is the food or service \"that bad\" to what the \"1 star-ers\" are saying.

I urge new patrons to come try The Perch. Though, it's been a little crowded when I've come, I look forward to sitting on the roof next time! The birds, the live music, the slight breeze...all make for a very pleasant atmosphere. 4 stars all the way; -1 star only because there may be 1 or 2 things to improve on, but if I could, I'd say 4.99999 stars!"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience ever. We made a reservation but no one among the trainees at the front could find it. There were empty tables but they sat us in an extra room that wasn't decorated where there were no other customers, no table set up, and the table wobbled. We ordered. It was our son's birthday. Waiter did not introduce himself and brought beer. Soda we ordered came half filled with no ice.The menu was a batch of pages from a printer with most of the selections crossed out. We were also told there were no potatoes. WHAT KIND OF RESTAURANT RUNS OUT OF POTATOES AT 6 PM?   It took 1.5 hours for the food to arrive - COLD PIZZA and a BURGER - an hour and a half. Complained and were told something about a recent remodel of their kitchen being the reason. Manager (who never introduced herself either and who did not speed anything up for us or seem to even know how to manage) came to table after we complained. She comped HALF the cost and gave us the beer free. Not sure why we were charged anything. ALSO, we saw a rat near the bird cages. DISGUSTING. I picked my purse up off the floor at that point. Just a horrible night. Son's birthday celebration was ruined. If we had paid, we'd have considered the value poor for the price we paid. Pizza wasn't much different from the kind you get delivered - except it was very small - and very expensive and very cold."}
{"text":"We didn't really know what to expect, but since this place was recommended by several people, we thought we'd give it a shot. We will DEFINITELY be back, and SOON! The atmosphere CANNOT be beat! The weather was absolutely perfect (so I'm not sure how manageable the heat would be in summer) but the food was absolutely fantastic! We loved all of the birds, truly a different experience!"}
{"text":"This place is three stars going on ten. It's got so much going for it. Great beer selection, tasty burgers, and a killer atmosphere. The service has really gotten good.

Flies. That's what's holding them back, which they may not be able to solve. Fought them off all lunch.

If you like good craft beer, this is one of the best selections in the valley. They have a red ale on tap! Could use a couple more, but it's a good one.

Come here. Try it for yourself. Probably no flies at night.

Let's make this place a success!"}
{"text":"Went here one night even though I hate birds (you can't tell what they're thinking- it's freaky). At night they are all sleeping and it was actually not as bad as I pictured.  It was pretty busy but the rooftop breeze was perfect! Service was nothing extraordinary but it was good. I would go back, at night. :)"}
{"text":"Yummy. Pork Sliders, craft beer, interesting surroundings.. It is getting better every month..
