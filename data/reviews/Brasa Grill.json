{"text":"Doesn't the idea of going out for Brazilian food sound fun & yummy?? If you're nodding your head 'yes! It does!'...take my word for it. Don't do it.  We decided to try Brasa when I saw a Groupon for 2 adults for $40. If I had to pay $80 for our meals, I would have hit the roof! This place is grody!  We were promptly served a gigantic basket under flowing with teeny undercooked dinner rolls. 4 bite sized doughy balls that tasted freezer burnt.  I ordered the Grapetini which tasted exactly like cough syrup. When I asked our server for another drink, his response was \"no one likes this drink\". Ok. Onto the salad bar.  Honestly, the best thing on it was the cheese. The shrimp cocktail made me nervous as it was room temp (not cold), the mussel was ok at best, the asparagus was undercooked, etc etc. I had no desire for seconds.  Once we decided to move onto the meat, we were quickly overwhelmed with servers      (Who were the best part of the experience because of their attention to our needs) offering us various types of beautiful looking skewered meats. However. Each one was either over cooked, dry or so salty it was inedible.  Long story short, we paid $40 for some of the worst food in Cleveland. Should have gone to B Spot."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a great meal! Steven was our server and he went out of his way to accommodate us. The salad bar was filled with great seafood, not just salad! And we had 12 different cuts of meat while we were there. Great staff. Great service. Great food. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I went to Brasa during a weekend visit with friends.  We had high hopes for this place, all-you-can-eat-meat after all, but were sorely disappointed.  The service was indifferent.  The waitress was scarce and acted as if she was doing us a favor by bringing us more drinks.  The salad bar was extensive and the dishes offered on it seemed very fresh.  I found the meat very over-seasoned though and not very high quality.  Some of the cuts were very good but others were serviceable at best, and downright inedible at worst (I found the lamb to be especially poor).  Overall I was not impressed and on my next visit I will try another one of the many restaurants in the Warehouse district."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. The variety of foods available keeps your palate interested. If you're feeling adventurous, as your server for the chicken hearts. Another tip: Skip the salad bar and save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"After winning a healthy amount at the casino, the gf and I decided to go to Brasa. On a browns game Sunday we were promptly seated and our waiter Sam immediately greeted us. He was friendly and helpful in our drink selection. The salad bar is bottomless and you won't be choosing salad with choices like shrimp, crab legs, olives, and various cheeses! When you are ready you flip over a card signaling the meat guys that you are ready for the onslaught. 13 different choices of excellently prepared meats. If you are into beef this allows you to enjoy the nuances of each cut back to back! Excellent service, perfect food priced right!"}
{"text":"Have been there twice. It doesn't compare with other Brazilian steakhouses in other cities. All of the meats taste surprisingly the same. Too pricy a place for mediocre food."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten at Brassa Grill on several occasions, including tonight. Always an enjoyable experience - great service, yummy food and relaxing atmosphere. Highly recommended. P.S. Marcello, thanks for your hospitality and for the surprise of a special desert!"}
{"text":"Brasa is an incredible experience...for a meat lover!  For my preparation, I eat a small breakfast and skip lunch which positions my stomach well for being able to sample whatever meat I desire :)  The basket of bread pieces w/cheese you start out with is quickly forgotten, don't think they really need that considering all the food available.  The sides that come out are just a few small plates that take up some room on the table, but the fried bananas standout as truly special to me.  Their salad bar is pretty good, but it's meant for having something to eat in addition to the array of meats which are the star of this place.  If you want to eat from the salad bar first, verify your card is turned over to red so you aren't surprised when people start showing up with meat.  While I believe the flank steak is the best, most flavorful item, all their meats are very good.  You will generally get skewers of chicken, ham, pork, lamb, turkey, and steak.  There will be different varieties of these foods of course, for example filet mignon wrapped in bacon or w/parmesan cheese.  Or, you could get served sausage and pork ribs, etc.  Also, let either your waiter or a man with a skewer(gaucho) you want a particular meat if you are frustrated with the meat you have been seeing come to your table.  Since they follow a rotation, there's always a chance the skewer of meat you want has been taken down by a table of 12 before it gets to your table :P    I probably eat a week's worth of recommended protein during the meal and the price is significant, which definitely makes this a special occasion kind of place for me."}
{"text":"It's an awesome experience. They are constantly bringing 14 different types of meat around for you to try and the complimentary fried bananas are delicious."}
{"text":"This place has done a complete 180. I have never seen something go from being great to terrible so quickly. I don't know if there is a new owner or what but this used to be one of my favorite restaurants and now I would never go again. If you don't mind spending $60-$70 per person for a ton of low quality highly salted meats then this is your place. They also have a sushi night on Monday with the worst sushi I have ever had. The staff is not happy when you order half off sushi either instead of the over priced all you can eat meat. If for some crazy reason you are forced to go here beware of their tactics. They come around with the sausages and chickens to avoid their higher quality filets. They do everything they can to fill you up including taking 15-20 minutes to come around with any decent meat so your food coma starts sinking in. If you like meat that much and have the money to blow go find a good steakhouse. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great meal, great service. Pricy but worth the visit. The pork ribs and the parmigiana filet mignon was well worth the second round. To my surprise they even have crab legs on the salad bar!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this location. First time was about 6 years ago with a large group. Last night went with total party of 5. Sat for 20 minutes  (may have been longer) and asked twice before finally receiving service. Was told by staff that the waiter was \"busy\". Found it odd that the general service changed around tip time. Hmmmmm"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and it never disappoints. I wouldn't waste anytime at the buffet!! The meat is always flavorful and juicy. On my last visit they had pineapple with cinnamon and sugar and it was so good! My favorite is the Parmesan crusted filet. The service is always wonderful. Come hungry!!"}
{"text":"The worst churrascaria I've ever been to, which is saying a lot considering the difficulty of screwing up endless beef.  The meats are hit-or-miss. The best is the flank, which is usually the best at all of them. But most if not all of the other cuts were underwhelming, underseasoned and over-cooked. The salad bar is lacking compared to others, and despite being one of the only tables in the entire restaurant we still barely got any attention from the servers.   $30 is completely reasonable for a brazilian steakhouse, but I'd happily pay $50 for a much better experience."}
{"text":"Visiting from Canada and had a desire for meat. We looked up online and decided to come to Brasa because of the reviews and the proximity to downtown. We walked 6 blocks in the rain and saw empty restaurant after empty restaurant. We noticed Brasa from a block away with people waiting outside to get in. We didn't have a reservation (mistake - make one) but pleaded for a table as we had come a great distance to be at this restaurant. Not only were we accommodated, but we were treated like kings. The service was fast and pleasant. I have been to Brazilian steakhouses in Vegas, Minnesota, and Canada. Brasa is one of the best. Excellent salad bar with a good variety - not just prosciutto and cheese. The gauchos were fast and generous. What a fabulous start to a great weekend of football and the Browns first win. We would definitely recommend and look forward to going back some day!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Brazilian steakhouse at which I have ever eaten. Meat is slow coming around and cold once it did come. Usually I have to be rolled out of a Brazilian steakhouse but this was not the case here. Salad bar is extremely weak. Sodas were flat and they brought the wrong soda. Silverware and chairs are cheap. The people are nice. That was the only redeeming quality."}
{"text":"I visited on a Saturday night it was pretty empty. Our server was okay not great . The food was just okay at best. The salad bar is only cold foods except for maybe two options there was nothing on there that really stood out as good . It looks as though the never restock the salad bar because the only two hot options were almost empty . As for the meats they were all served promptly however they were not that tasty they had no seasoning the flank was horrible i couldn't even eat it. The best pieces of meat i had was the ham, sirloin and the chicken leg other than that everything else was just  meat . It is considerably expensive considering the quality of food that is offered. I cant even see how they can justify the price honestly. I wouldn't mind paying the $40 per person if it was great food but it wasn't and if you plan on visiting this place please don't save your money go somewhere else, please!"}
{"text":"Thought it would be a good experience. I've had this kind of dining before i Atlanta and it was a lot of fun, but unfortunately we never even got to sample the cuisine at this establishment. My mom made a reservation for the night of her 50th for 8 people. She'd spoken with a \"gentleman\" on the phone who'd informed her that she would be all set with the reservation and that she would even get a private room for us to enjoy. She was really surprised at that because it was last minute and for a Saurday night, but he assured her it was all set. We arrived to find a table set up in the middle of the dining room. It turns out that there are in fact no private rooms at this establishment at all.   This was disappointing but we could have recouped from it, except when my mom spoke to the manager, who was in fact the same man with whom she'd spoken to make the reservation initially, he fervently denied ever having that conversation with her and was in fact quite rude and dismissive of our whole party. I guess business is good enough that you can afford to not care that a party of 8 is unhappy.   It's really not a big deal that the room was nonexistent. What made the difference was that the manager forgot his customer service training. Instead of being intent on telling us that we were wrong and that he'd \"never had that conversation\", his tact should have been to tell us how he was going to fix it. Honestly, in a situation like that something as simple as, \"I'm sorry about the misunderstanding. How about we give your table an appetizer\" or \"how about we arrange for a birthday dessert for the birthday girl\" or something like that goes a long way towards appeasing unhappy customers and solidifying their repeat business. In this case his attitude caused us to turn around and go elsewhere.   Note: I am not a hard-to-please customer. My job requires a great deal of customer service, I have worked in the restaurant industry for years...heck, I won't go into a restaurant that is closing within 30 minutes because I know folks are starting to break down and clean up to go home. All I ask for is a little kindness and respect. We got neither."}
{"text":"An excellent choice to wow out of town guests. The food is endless. The service impeccable. I will be back at Brasa as often as possible."}
{"text":"A friend & I went Monday night 4.17 after the Steve Hofstetter comedy show without reservations. The staff from start to finish impeccable! The food divine & fresh & such a wonderful array! Highly recommend, & will visit again soon!! David Wolf, Cleveland, OH (not enough thumbs up, very impressed, first time there)..."}
{"text":"Do you like meat?  Go here.  Period.  It will change your life.  The meat here is incredible.  INCREDIBLE.  And it's all you can eat.  Fast before you go, skip the salad bar, and pack that meat in like you're a bear getting ready to hibernate.  Yes it's expensive, but that's the price you pay for food that inspires religious experiences.    Do you have vegetarian friends?  Why?  Leave them behind!  Some things are more important than friendship.  I firmly believe that throughout the entire existence of humanity-- past, present, and future-- no one has ever or will ever experience more satisfying food than this.   This knowledge gives me peace.    Brasa is a blessing to us all."}
{"text":"This a carnivore's paradise!  Lean, quality meats that are all you can eat. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Crowded and happening beyond belief, showing there is life in Cleveland yet!  Crazy bar scene.  The all-inclusive setup appealed to me: for $40 you could stuff yourself silly.  To call the salad bar a salad bar really doesn't do it justice, as there were beautiful and tasty salads, fresh mozzarella and smoked gouda, shrimp cocktail plus several different types of green salad to choose from.  The meats just kept on coming - yum and perfect.  I wanted to like the cheesy bread balls but they were an odd combination of raw and overdone.  Done properly, they'd be heavenly.  Dessert was a creme brulee recommended by one of the guys with knives as the best anywhere in Cleveland, and he was right.  Nice priced wine list too."}
{"text":"We came here for a reserved birthday party on a Saturday around 6pm.  This was my first visit to Brasa. I will truthfully say that I would not be upset to ever go there again! Service was very slow. I was smart and ordered a bottle of wine which of course was marked up excessively; however was worth it as to not have to wait so long for drinks. Others in my group waited an average of 10-15 minutes for a beer! The salad bar was okay and had a variety to choose from of which I enjoyed but the price is too high for just the salad bar at about $30 bucks..I'd rather travel down to the local casino buffet for that price! The meat started coming around and it was either over cooked or under cooked. A few times we had to send them back to the grill as the cow was still mooing. Others like it that way but I do not therefore it was not satisfying. Also while waiting for more meat to come around you get full. So it's also difficult to eat your $45 bucks worth! Not a big fan. Cleveland has much better to offer!!!"}
{"text":"I go to the restaurant every time I'm in Cleveland. Brasa never fails to impress, especially in terms of their service! Every waiter and waitress is personable, and a manager is always walking around and attending to customers.The food is incredible, and every slice of meat tastes unique. I would recommend Brasa to anybody looking for anybody quality fine dining experience in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Needs new management!  Ate there Saturday night (our 3rd time) and this place has gone down hill over the years. The food was mostly all over cooked, the server was bad, the hostess was worse and I don't mind paying the $45 a plate, $10 drinks AND automatic 20% gratuity (party of 6) not to mention the $8 vallet....IF I AM EATING AT Fogo de Chao....dont expect that experience here."}
{"text":"Classic Brazilian cousin. One of the best restaurants around! Good choice for meat fans!"}
{"text":"My husband and I received a gift certificate to this restaurant so honestly we probably would not have tried Brasa otherwise. The food was amazing!  The salad bar alone can be your meal!  Try the lasagna, it was FANTASTIC!  The servers are very attentive and our server, Caroline was great. Yes it is pricy but for what you get, it is well worth it!  We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Way over priced! $30 just for a salad bar that did not off many choices. Not only that, when we let the waiter knownthat we were just having the salad(that we didn't even like), we notice a few minutes later that our waiter and someone, whom i assumed was part of the management, were talking about us since they looked away suspiciously once we made eye contact. Then they wouldn't give us the time of day when all we wanted was the check so we could just GET OUT OF THERE!"}
{"text":"We went to Brasa for a work dinner on a Saturday evening.  We did have a reservation and were seated fairly quickly.  The servers were very prompt and friendly.  The salad bar really deserves 5 stars as it was expansive.  Having been to other Brazilian steakhouse restaurants, we were a bit disappointed in the meat.  There were many choices but several were a bit dry and some rather fatty.  None of the choices really stood out as fantastic, although the flavor was good.  I would recommend this restaurant if you have a group with varied tastes and want to experience the ambiance of a Brazilian steakhouse."}
{"text":"This is a great place to experience at least once and for me that one time is all I need.   The salad bar buffet was good and has many options especially for vegetarians (who also eat seafood). This is a great restaurant for anyone who can get their money's worth. I really wasn't impressed by the flavors/seasonings of the meat choices. I did try one of everything but I found myself wasting more food than eating something I truly enjoy. I would have much rather have paid $45 for one fantastic steak."}
{"text":"Whew. Brasa was weird for me.   I'm only a recently converted meat lover. For the longest time, I thought steak was a punishment. But now, I enjoy and often crave big juicy pink-in-the-middle steaks and burgers, though I still can't say I like pork. Everything else is fair game, though!   But, still...even though I like meat now, I was thoroughly overwhelmed by Brasa. The \"salad\" bar was probably the most exciting part to me because I could assemble a random and snack-like dinner that included crab legs! The wonder! There's something to be said for the gigantic skewers of meat, though. But I'm not sure what that something really is. The meats were good, but I felt like the flavors and textures were mixing and I really couldn't appreciate one particular meat at a time. Like I said, overwhelming.   I really think this is more of an experience than a meal. The lavishness of getting hunks of meat sliced onto your plate is something most people only imagine happening for Vikings or at Renaissance Fairs, so if you can go to dinner and have this happen, it's like a dream! If you're an extreme meat eater, then this could really be a good deal for you because you could get your money's worth of food, but I don't feel like I can eat that much! Also worth mentioning is the dim lighting. I was really surprised at how dark it was in here, which made all of the meat just look like darks hunks of food on my plate. I'm a bit of a visual eater and really could have used some more light to see what I was putting in my mouth.   Really, if I come here again, I'll probably only go for the salad bar because I can really put away the mussels and crab. Oh, and those weird cheese bread balls in the baskets on the tables are AMAZING. So much cheesy goodness!"}
{"text":"So glad I read all these reviews before trying this place. I saw a special on groupon and received $60 for $30, which was a great value. Also, even though there was only two of us I requested a larger table which was very comfortable. I didn't fill up on the salad bar even though I really did enjoy it.  Green for go, time to eat meat and lots of it. There were 13 different meats on this Friday evening which was more than enough as far as I'm concerned. Lets see if I can recollect a few, beef and pork ribs, parm crusted filet, bacon wrapped filet and turkey, lamb, ham, pork tenderloin, prime rib, sirloin, chicken wing and my favorite was flank steak.   Some meats were over cooked, some were done to perfection. I made sure to try everything so I can give an honest review. I don't think its worth mentioning all the ones that were over cooked because the first time I had the pork ribs they were delish and the second time they were hard as a rock. It just depends on how its cooked, they are all prob pre-seasoned and marinated.  I do want to talk about the wonderfully seasoned and beautifully prepared flank steak. Cooked medium, seasoned to perfection and one of the best tasting steaks I have ever come across. I don't (or didn't) even like flank steak and now its all I can think about. Also, I really enjoyed the pork tenderloin. Don't know what made it so divine, it just was. Normally, I go crazy for filet but not this time. It was well done. My date dubbed this his favorite restaurant as he is a meat head and has a big appetite. There is no question we will be back for more. I had the passion fruit creme brulee for desert and next time I'm not ordering that. Just OK.   Everything else was very yummy and the experience and service deserves 5 stars alone. They had groucho's to cut the meat, a girl just to refill drinks, and we had a server. We never had a dull moment. Love, love, love Brasa Grill."}
{"text":"The story has not changed much. The menu is basically the same and the salad bar had a few new additions. About the meat menu, they have added parm chicken to the menu which is great. While most of the churrascaria chains have added this item to the menu and why not, it is cheap, easy to make, and tasty. Brasa has added soup to the salad bar, at least the night I was there. It was a heavy cream Lobster Bisque. It was very thick, possibly with flour added to fill up the guests so they don't eat as much filet mignon, who knows but overall was tasty but I prefer the Texas De Brazil bisque variety that they frequently have.   I like that Brasa is in Cleveland, my hometown and current address, as well it was the first all-you-can-masticate Brazilian experience. However I am not impressed. The first time I was blown away and ever since it is a few good with a few bad. What I would recommend is thinking of an item that would set them apart from the rest of the churrascaria chains. I met the owner (Marcelo?) once and I have some recommendations but those never occurred as well he said email next time I visited and I sent him an email to no reply. Shame. The big picture is that, I went for restaurant week unintentionally for a V-day dinner so it worked out well. We paid only $40/person with a dessert but it was not a choose your dessert, they picked so we got these cheesecake muffin like balls that were really good and not offered on the dessert tray so that was a surprise but-- let's be real, just let the people pick a dessert. If it is good then they leave happy and they may want to come back for the dessert. I would. So stop being cheap.   The sad part is that we were also there for our anniversary *V-day/Anniversary meal* and no mention. This was the same after attending for my birthday in 2016 in July, no free dessert or even mention. For the price, the experience is lacking. I have been to Texas-DB, Fogo DC, Rodizio, etc and they all made sure to acknowledge why we were dining there whereas Brasa does not so maybe pick somewhere else for special occasions."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for (4) for 6:30 PM on Saturday using the \"open table\" app this was my first experience using this app and it worked perfectly. We arrived about 15 minutes early and took advantage of the valet parking it was $8 with no validation at the restaurant. The hostess greeted us and acknowledged the reservation and directed us to the bar while they prepared our table.  At 6:30 PM promptly we were notified by the hostess that our table was ready. We were seated on the right side of the restaurant a few tables from the salad bar. Our server greeted us and asked if we would like to place a drink order and ensured our water glasses were filled, and then after a few instructions showed us the way to the salad bar.   The salad bar is four sided with a variety of salad items some cheeses, olives, peppers, asparagus, heart of palm and a few other speciality items including grilled salmon and vegetable  lasagna. I didn't feel the offerings were bad just not on par with a few of the other Brazilian Steak houses I frequent but they were well presented.  We ordered a bottle of 2011 Louis Jadot Pinot Noir to start I asked for it to be slightly tempered before the cork was removed so our server promptly brought over a ice bucket and iced the wine for about ten minutes to get the temperature closer to the mid 50 degree mark then opened up a spectacular bottle of wine it was full bodied with a clean finished which was more fruity than oaky but not sweet.  Our table was then presented with several sides which were included with the meal a nice chutney, a Brazilian seasoning, white rice, fried plantains and polenta.  As you would expect after flipping the single card placed on the table from red to green the meat presentation began. I just love getting small slices of seasoned flame licked meats table side, there were several nice beef selections including beef ribs, smoked ham, pork loin, pork ribs, lamb, chicken done several ways and the most succulent Brazilian sausage. After methodically tasting each and a few selections several times it was apparent that this would continue until someone threw in the towel and flipped the card back to red. I must say all the meats were perfectly cooked and presented in a timely matter the service here was exceptional.  Our server never interrupted our conversation but made sure everything was filled or replaced as needed the entire nite once he seen we had exhausted our ability to consume any more meat he without prompting brought each of us a shot glass of almond liquor to settle things. Then presented us with an array of dessert options.  We choose a few to share, a few mango sherbets served in a frozen half mango shell that had been scooped out and placed in a chilled glass topped with a mint leaf and a strawberry so refreshing and cleansing. Then a chocolate lava cake filled with warm mousse and drizzled in hot fudge topped with vanilla ice cream and fresh whipped creme.  All in all it was a nice dinner and a great value, the service was excellent and this being the only real Brazilian Steak House in Cleveland it represents the culinary culture well and I definitely would return."}
{"text":"Tried this place with a friend and it was a lot of fun.  The quality of some of the meats could be a little better, but I really enjoyed the lamb and bacon wrapped filet.  The appetizer dishes were pretty dull, but the meats were pretty tasty.    I had filet wrapped in bacon, turkey loin wrapped in bacon, lamb, flank steak, sirloin steak, lamb, chicken leg, lamb.  Worth giving a try sometime if you have a big appetite."}
{"text":"Meat lovers heaven but some of the meat was lacking seasoning but the Picanha ( Top Sirloin-special Brazilian cut) & the leg of Lamb had the most flavor & was my favorite.  The Filet com Queijo was rather tough & the beef rib (if I remember correctly) was rather fatty. They bring you an al a cart of rice, french fries fried bananas, salsa & bread. I had the Peach margarita which was excellent. My vegetarian friend enjoyed their salad bar she was full & happy we came. I went on a Tues. night & we were in there with about 5 other people & our waiter was not the most attentive. One of the men walking around with the meat actually brought me a brochure with a list of the different meats they offered. I'd go back bcuz I luv meat & especially the Picanha & the leg of lamb. The atmosphere is very nice & elegant."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and have been very happy with both visits.    The salad bar is not the typical salad bar. There are hot and cold dishes on it including the standard expected salad fare. One of the hot dishes on the bar was a white fish that was delicious and perfectly cooked. We had a party of eight and all of us loved it. The cheese on the salad bar looked dried out as if it had been sitting too long.   Then there is the meat...flip the card over and be prepared to be showered with endless choices of skewered meats. Our favorites were the bacon wrapped turkey and the sausages. The beef was great too but for me was overshadowed by the other above mentioned meats.   They also being the table several sides including rice and fried plantains.   We all got desert as well and the crepe brûlée was awesome with the perfect shattering sugar top."}
{"text":"Very expensive, but great food.  Come hungry.  It's an experience more than just a meal.  First, there's a large appetizer/salad type bar.  Don't fill up too much here.  The meal is huge.  They bring you wonderful sides and meats to your table.  You get a card that you keep turned up to have them bringing you food, or turn over to stop.  There are a wonderful variety of meats and sides.    You're definitely paying a little more for the ambience.  But the desserts are also wonderful and the we found now love the Portuguese almond liquor that we first had there.  Much smoother than Disarrono and easily sippable.   If you're in Cleveland, try this nice Portuguese style brassierrie."}
{"text":"The hostess was rude.  If your whole party does not arrive on time you are in jeopardy of losing your table. You cannot be seated until your WHOLE party arrives.  The hostess reminds you how late everyone is every two to three minutes as if that will get them there faster.   This location is in downtown Cleveland, Ohio and with events and weather you cannot always control when you will arrive.   The hostess punished our 6 top party by being seated at a table made for 4 and in a super busy artery of the restaurant so everyone who went to the buffet passed us and all the waiters going to and from the bar also blew passed us.   There was a beautiful empty table tucked away in the corner we asked to be switched to at which time the hostess said was reserved... and it was empty the entire 2 1/2 hours we were there.    The restaurant was busy and pretty full but not packed to capacity.    FOOD:    Buffet: everything that was supposed to be HOT was barely luke warm  (pasta, muscles and veggies.)  Meat: we flipped our card and no one came. After about 10 minutes of chatter I flagged down our waiter and asked him, \"Where's the beef?\" Pun intended.  ;)  All of the meat then suddenly appeared. It was all pretty flavorful and piping hot however a lot were dry and overcooked.  Landy, our server, was the only thing that saved this experience. He was very polite and seemed to see that we got the shaft.   The only reason I would recommend this place after this visit (I had been there previously on a two person date where we both arrived together) is because it's the only place of its kind in this area. :/"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in The Land, I usually head for this place, plus Melt Bar and Grilled. I love Brazilian BBQ both because I like eating creatively prepared cuts of meat and because I'm a cheapo and love value. Unfortunately, most buffets are puke city because establishments cut prices AND quality. Don't ask how some of those animals you're eating were raised.  I love Brazilian BBQ, tho, because you get both value (all you can eat) and quality cuts. This place is pretty standard B3Q, but at prices way better than what you'd find if you did this in like LA or something. I love it!  Best stuff is the bacon wrapped sausage and the drummetes. They'll also bring you specific stuff if you just ask for it."}
{"text":"Came to Brasa as a birthday surprise for the lady. I made a reservation as it was Game 6 of the NBA Finals. We got there and the place was empty. I was kind of surprised given what was going on Downtown that evening.   Started with the salad bar. Salad was good and fresh. They had a lot of things there that I don't eat so just had the salad and shrimp. They had smoked salmon which made the my lady quite happy. Everything on the consensus was good.   The meat portion was the best part. All different kinds of meat came out rapid fire. So much so I forgot was was even on my plate. Filet, beef and pork ribs. Chicken, flank steak and leg of lamb. Everything was really good. The lamb and pork ribs stood out. There was this cinnamon and sugar coated pineapple that was amazing! We also ordered a Long Island and a Mojito. Both were very good.   Lady had raspberry cheesecake for desert. It was pretty dried out. Like it was old. This was the only knock on the place.   I'd guess that the service is quite a bit slower when they're busy but it was super quick because it was a slow night. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My wife and her brother went to Brasa this weekend to celebrate his birthday. The street is under construction so you have to pull up behind orange barrels and unpaved street to get valet service. Obviously this is not long term, but worth noting if you're planning on going soon. We had made a reservation on open table unnecessarily as the place was maybe 20% full at 8:30 on a Saturday evening, granted it was a holiday weekend. I think it could be quite noisy if the place was full. This would be an awesome place for groups. Although there was a group there when we were there that started getting really loud and rowdy near the end of the evening.   This was our first visit to Brasa so we got the rundown from our waiter who was very friendly and attentive all evening. The wine selection was good but their inventory was poor. The first three red wines we asked for they were out off. The waiter cited a very busy week as the reason for the shortage. He was very understanding and didn't try to upsell us on the wine. Instead he offered similar selections and ended up bringing out one for us to sample. The salad bar was generous, salmon was the best (although probably not worth $30 by itself). Once the meat started coming it was a sight to see. All the selections (12 different meats that evening) were excellent. We really enjoyed the fillet!  The have an outdoor patio that could be fun on a summer evening. It'd be fun watching peoples reactions, if nothing else. All in all we spent two hours here and loved every minute. Excellent food and attentive service. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We ate at Brasa on Friday night with a Groupon. I had been wanting to try Brasa for awhile. I expected a much more impressive presentation for the price. The salad bar has a decent selection, but nothing special. Besides the salad bar you can opt to get meet delivered to your plate by waiters walking around with meat on a stick that they cut right onto your plate. There are sixteen different types of meat to choose from. Not all of the meat was cooked properly however. Some seemed overcooked and some were definitely undercooked. My wife is a picky eater and it definitely isn't a place for the picky. The servers don't offer much of a description of each meat and they don't stop coming if you have your coater flipped over indicating you'd like meat. Our main waiter had a serious attitude and made a very mean comment about the hostess after she say us. Even with the groupon we felt like we got taken for a ride."}
{"text":"My husband had to drag me here...and I was sure glad that he did!!! It is spendy...but worth it for all the food that you can actually eat. If you leave feeling hungry then that is your own fault. Skip the salad bar area as that is a joke and I would never spend $30 just to have what was on the salad bar.   The host said that they were offering 14 different meats. I didn't see that many pass by...but I fell in love with the meats. Some were a bit dry, and i made a mental note on what not to ask for again.   Such a great place for an anniversary like I was there for. I can not wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. The salad bar was delicious with all fresh ingredients. The choices were very refreshing. Sometimes fine dining can be....trendy? The same dishes/flavor combos all the time.   *NOTE: IF YOU DONT LIKE THE PRICE DONT GO. Why complain \"oh its just a bunch of meat and overpriced\" you knew that before you went in there. And still stuffed your face.*  The staff was very polite and accommodating.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"DAMN expensive but damn good to match.  If you've never had brazilian BBQ, you have a coaster with a red and green dot on either side.  If you turn over the green, then guys come around with about 15 successive cuts of meat on sticks, over and over and over again, and give you bits of whatever you want.  We special requested something so rare that it was almost raw, but it was so good!  I think it's like $30-35 per plate."}
{"text":"If you chew a single bite of food on the weekend you're planning to go to a Brazilian steakhouse, you are a fool.  No, to properly do Brasa, you must starve yourself like an ascetic, emptying out your stomach so it is little more than an empty sack, and by the time you arrive at the Grill you must be as ravenous as a zombie.    Then you flip that plastic chip over to \"Green\" and let the waiters run up to you with swords bearing tasty, tasty meat.  And you shove as much into your gullet as possible so that when you walk out of that restaurant your stomach is a straining Hefty bag filled with half-digested cow.    At Brasa, you become a meat smuggler.  Your goal is to pay the man $35 and walk out with $50 of steaks in your belly.  Sure, your gut will ache for three days afterwards and you don't want to know what your toilet will look like as your colon goes into emergency overdrive in its vain attempts to digest an entire lamb... But it's WORTH it, goddammit.    Brasa is no different.  As has been noted elsewhere, it's not as good as, say, Fogo de Chao, but that's like saying that Harry Potter's not as good as Shakespeare.  (Or vice-versa, if you're not a muggle.)  The meats are still excellent, and you get as much of them as you want.    That said, the weird thing is that the quality of this place's dishes change from night to night  - my friends told me I had to get the flank steak, which on that night wasn't very good at all (they agreed), but the tenderloin was excellent.  So if you really have a hankerin' for their lamb, be warned that it can change violently depending on the evening.    Also, don't bother with the orange-muddled drink that attempts to be a mojito variant.  It's pure vodka with acid citrus.  Not good at all.  However, you MUST have a shot of the delectable almond liqueur Dohrina, which is awesome.  In other news, the Grill has an awesome salad bar.  It seems to be a big laugh on vegetarians.  Why would you go to a steakhouse, you silly herbivores?  But if you do, you can pay way too much to eat leaves, g'wan."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Brazilian restaurant. I enjoyed my experience, it he meat was good and the salads bar I enjoyed.......if I had to complain about something then I would have to say that the table they gave us was inside the cooler off of the main floor and that's because the restaurant was pretty full and we did not have reservations........yea we could have left and went else where but I had already tipped for valet......will go again and give a more solid comment but now it was a good experience"}
{"text":"As one other reviewer said \"if I could give them negative stars I would\".  What a shame to have such a great location and serve the worst food imaginable.   As one of the meat handlers was slicing the steak that was completely raw I joked that I haven't had food poisoning in a while.  Well my wife and I barely  made it home before getting sick.   This place should just shut down.  Please take my advice and save yourself from a high priced case of the sh&@&!  You'd be better off eating Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Very nice selection of items  Salad bar was nice.  I liked how they came around with the meat items and choose what you wanted.  Almost like dim sum.  Can be a little pricey.  Save this for special occasion."}
{"text":"I would like to update a previous review and give it an extra star. We recently went to Brasa again for my boyfriend's birthday. This time, we had some of the drinks, the quality of the drinks are superb! I suggest the Sunburn and the mojito roja.  Well woth the extra star!"}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.  Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"I called to make a reservation for a party of 12 a week in advance and was told that I would have to place a large deposit in case \"we don't show up\". I can understand if they will not guarantee my table to be held longer than a certain amount of time (so that they do not lose money), but the deposit was asking too much. I could have easily paid it but I did not like the way they do business. It also is not advertised or mentioned anywhere on their website, FB page or anything.  Has anyone else had this happen to them? I have never had a restaurant ask for a deposit when it is not a party room/catered event and honestly it was off-putting. I will not be dining there and will be taking my party across the street to one of the many places that would welcome us without some sort of fee in advance. They just lost almost $1000."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what other churrascaria are available in Cleveland, but this was the first one that I became aware of.  After a couple of months here, I finally made it out to try it.  It's managed by the same group that owns the Sunset Lounge...  The lighting is dim, and goes for a cool-hip motif.  The decor is competent, but hardly breath taking.  The servers, on my visit were efficient but were clearly not interested in being pleasant.  I'm used to going to Brasilian staffed Rodizios, where they are proud of being Brasilian.  This place didn't exude that sort of raison d'etre.  In fact, upon being asked, they had only one Brasilian in their employ at the time.  No obrigados for you!  The buffet has a lot of foods, but very generic.  No Yuca of any sort.  The feel is a typical buffet, with shrimp, pasta, cheeses etc.  Competent, but without love or passion.  The meat came fast, and it was rather decent.  Chicken, sausage, sirloin, prime rib, lamb chops, lamb roast, and flank steak, as well as ham.  No roast cheese.  Decent, but not great.  Again, not spiced with passion, not served with zeal.  Darn.  Still, it's not bad.  I prefer the Caipirinhas at Sarava by far, by the way.  Would I go back? Tough question.  If I can't find a better Brasilian bbq, I might have no choice but to try it again.  Most likely, however, I'll get my fix in another city.    If one must gorge, gorge well.  Why gorge with foods that aren't devilishly good?"}
{"text":"The service was good, the food mediocre. Seems like it's quantity over taste here, not really worth going back."}
{"text":"I have been to another Brazilian steakhouse before in San Diego, so when the Groupon showed up in my email, I had to go for this one.  The hostess was really nice and sat us immediately.  We had a reservation, but got there about 20 minutes early.  We were immediately served water and rolls. The waitress was very nice and explained to us how it works at the restaurant. T  he salad bar was very good, many different types of sides and salads to try. The mushroom salad was delicious. Once we were finished we flipped our card over to green so that they would start bringing the meat.  The meat was very good. As with every Brazilian steakhouse, they brought an array to try. My favorite was the top sirloin. The guys that brought the meat were polite.   All in all, this place was clean, staff was courteous and nice, and it has a great romantic type feel. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had a very good meal. The salad bar was also very good. The meats do keep coming and coming. Outstanding Place, I'll be back."}
{"text":"On the good news front, the wine pour is very generous.  It's pretty mediocre after that.  Maybe it's not fair comparing this place to other rodizio's around the country, but if they're expecting $45 for a meal, then all bets are off.  Yes, you can stuff yourself silly eating the endless parade of meats that are delivered to the table.  But if almost every one is dry and overdone, then it certainly takes away from the experience.  Only the flank steak and the sirloins (top and bottom) had any color to them.  And there was not accompanying sauces like a chimichurri or something similar to help with the flavor.  They began to taste pretty much the same.  The salad bar was an odd assortment of items (including a bowl of anchovies that didn't seem to go with anything).  The sides were fairly sparse, too.  I skipped dessert and walked out having paid over $60 for one--it's turned me off from rodizios for a long, long time."}
{"text":"Went here for an early Valentines Day dinner with the boyfriend, and we loved this place! Like the other reviews say, you don't come here for the buffet of sides- we ended up just getting some veggies to balance out all of the meat you get here! Everything else in the buffet is just so-so, nothing too special. In addition to the buffet of sides, you get some sides at the table as well- we particularly enjoyed the fried bananas, and even ordered seconds! But anyway, let's get to the important stuff- the meat! There are 15 different meats they have floating around the restaurant, and we tried all of them! There were only 1 or 2 that we didn't enjoy as much. Some of our favorites were the bacon wrapped turkey and filet, the top sirloin, parmesan crusted filet and chicken, and the leg of lamb! Keep in mind that this is all you can eat, so come prepared! We ate large breakfast in the morning, worked out, and didn't eat anything for the rest of the day to prepare which ended up being perfect! Another plus, the service was great- hostess, waiter, and staff serving the meat were all attentive and friendly! This was definitely a fun dining experience, and we were not disappointed!"}
{"text":"I really wish this was better... The food is good, but nothing amazing. For the price, you can eat all you want, and all their meats are great, the sides were good, but the service took a little too long for our drinks & the \"salad bar\" that includes pasta & seafood options was below average for my liking. Even so, it's a nice place but they could try a bit harder for the price they're charging! I did eat there a few years ago, in 2013 and I feel like the food was much better then... Will try again, I guess!"}
{"text":"Brasa was outstanding from start to finish.  The quality of the sides is not quite as good as at Churrascaria Plataforma in NYC, but seriously, do you really go to a churrascaria for the side dishes?  At most, this downgrades Brasa from an A-plus to (merely) an A.  Every meat I tried was at least very good.  The flank steak and the parmesean-crusted filet were off-the-chain though.  I have never had more tender flank steak anywhere.  Service was also excellent.  The servers were very accommodating of requests for more or less well-done portions, and if you wanted more of a specific meat, you only had to ask once for it (if at all).  For those who care about sides, the salad bar was full of very high quality items, including fresh shrimp and some hot dishes, but it did not have as extensive a selection as Plataforma.  This, of course, left more room for meat, delicious meat.  Perhaps this was a blessing in disguise?"}
{"text":"Looking for something unique for a birthday dinner while in town for the day.  If you love meat, this is the place to go. Lots of choices from beef, chicken and lamb.  Nice side dishes that included mash potatoes, beans, salsa, seasoning.  There is also an amazing salad bar. Don't fill up on it if you like grilled meat.  They even provided a complimentary flan desert for my birthday."}
{"text":"My first visit to Brasa was pretty good, expensive, but good! We made reservations for 5pm on a Saturday, showed up and was seated right away. I will start off my saying I would most definatly NEVER take my kids (8 & 11) here. I could list about 50 reasons why, but I wont. There were people with kids, but personally  mine would have hated everything about it.   I'll start with the salad bar. The selection was not as huge as I had expected, per other reviews. They had a decent selection of olives, cheeses, crackers, pickles and a few un identifiable things. I'm not an olive fan, so I skipped that whole thing. The pasta salads which included a ham and cheese pasta salad, potato and crab, plain crab and a shell pasta with mayo, celery and capers (my fave), were all decent. I tried the crab salad, huge chunks of crab and the ham and cheese pasta salad was OK.  Now the meat, lots and lots of meat. I wasn't really a fan of how they walk around and offer you a small piece of meat. A waiter walks around with his or her beef, chicken, pork, whatever and they cut you a small portion and I mean small portion. So, if the place is busy you could have an empty plate for awhile, until someone makes it back to you.  All of the meats they offered were wonderful, but I just wasn't fond of the process in which you get the meat.   The only major complaint I have is the size of our table and the price of our meal.We were seated at a table for 2 and the thing was seriously the size of an end table in your living room. I was super uncomfortable and the next table was elbow to elbow with us. I really hated every minute of sitting at that table. I had just enough room for my plate, water glass, silverware, salt and pepper shakers were on the edge.  As far as the price, $80 for 2 I think is a little high, considering the meat wasn't the greatest thing I've ever had.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it wasn't the BEST I've ever had. I would probably go back, request a normal sized table and try to get the whole flip your card, wait for food thing down.  It's an experience and it's worth the money at least once!"}
{"text":"We were lured back with a Groupon ... And took what we learned from our first visit to demand a table in the main dining room - it made all the difference! It was rodizio as we remember it should be. Bravo Brasa!  We arrived on time for our reservations, but had to wait about 15 minutes as the host accommodated our request for a table for 2 in the Big Group area. He seemed very reluctant to put us there - but we held firm. We were seated next to a huge column, but it was worth it since we were here for the meat, not a 360 view of the dining room.  The table was about 30% bigger than the first visit - sounds strange, but it makes a huge difference when you don't feel everything is crammed on the table.   Service was friendly, energetic and CONSTANT ... No lulls in drink service, water refills or, most importantly, meat delivery. The gauchos were on top of their game - meat choices arrived with a smile, clearly stating what cut they were offering and cutting to your selected doneness. Everything was hot and when you noted your favorites, they made a point of returning with a smile and a fresh, hot skewer of wonderfully flavorful meat.  The vibe in The Big Room is jovial - people enjoying the meal and one another. Such a change for the 'date room' where couples are crammed into tiny tables and have long lulls spent longinly looking for the next gaucho to arrive. I REALLY recommend - for any size party - demand to sit in the main dining room - it's a completely different - and much better - experience."}
{"text":"No garlic beef or grilled pineapple. The 2 best things on the menu. Otherwise still great."}
{"text":"I went here when I had the Groupon- I had heard good things and wanted to check it out. It's definitely a cool experience and Brazilian steakhouses are always fun, but I wouldn't say anything really knocked me off my feet.  Well, that's a lie. I requested a nicer spot and they definitely made that happen. They put us in their wine area and it almost felt like we were in our own room. The \"salad\" bar is a LOT more than salad. Be prepared for crab legs, chicken, salmon, and the normal salad fixings. I asked for some tools to eat my crab legs and they didn't have anything useful, which I was pretty surprised by.  The meat was good, I like the parmesan crusted steak the best. I wasn't a huge fan of the sausages and the two of us both had those leftover at the end.  Our waiter was really cool and knowledgable, and he made us a fun after dinner drink with coffee, cinnamon, and fire.  Overall, I'm glad I went and I definitely enjoyed it. I probably wouldn't go back without the Groupon because 40$ is a lot for what it was."}
{"text":"Be prepared to spend roughly 35 dollars a person before drinks or dessert. The food is delicious. It's low lighting and quiet. The servers are kind and to the point. There's a salad bar. The website is great to check out in advance of going. I'd definately like to go again sometime."}
{"text":"So it's meat. And for the most part it was tasty. However, I fail to see the novelty in paying 100 dollars to eat mass produced meat.   Add in the fact that it took forever to get service sometimes and the salad bar was far from impressive and this becomes just another disappointing dining experience.   My husband and I were seated at the worst possible table. In a small dark corner where we could barely see each other never mind what was on our plates. Our server was absent at best. The meat men did there jobs when they had anything left but it was obvious our section was just an after thought.   The wine was fine but all they had to do was cork the bottle. My husband's mojito was meh.  Really I fail to see why this is such a hot place. It's a lot of meat. Nothing more. I'm glad we had the groupon otherwise this place was so not worth the drive to 9th.  Don't miss: getting the groupon otherwise the price is just ridiculous. Hit or miss: The meat. The chicken, turkey, seafood on the buffet was all pretty tasteless. The lamb was overcooked. The filet was perfect but I like near raw meat.  Avoid like the plague: The salad bar.  and the \"side dishes\" aka watery salsa, fake french fries and over cooked rice."}
{"text":"Mediocre. I've been to several of these Brazilian steak places. This one is the worst. Parm filet was good but many of the meats were dry and/or tasteless. Salad bar was downright embarrassing compared with other similar restaurants in other cities. They offered about 5 things to add to a green salad-really?!?! Crab salad with fake crab was inedible. Cheese bread was a gross little blob of cheese inside a ball of dough. uck! Fun idea for sure but really pricey for the offerings and quality. They could easily upgrade a few things to make it better."}
{"text":"For Nolan's baseball party weekend, we decided we had to have one good steak dinner.  The original choice didn't sound very good to me, so I fired up yelp where I found Brasa.  It turned out to be a big success.  When we walked in with baseball caps and jeans, we looked a little out of place.  I questioned privately if I had made the right choice.  We were starving, so we immediately attacked the salad bar which has a nice crab salad among other choices.  The meats were out shortly after and in no time we were stuffed.  Compared to fog de chao, the meats and salads are inferior, but it's still a fun and tasty experience.  Most of the group had never had a brazillian steakhouse experience, but by the end, a few were already talking about doing this again in the future."}
{"text":"The restaurant I compare this with is Texas de Brazil, which we do not have in Cleveland, but I've visited in other states.  Let's start: 1. The salad bar: It needed life. It could have been more vibrant or fresh. Even though not likely true, the produce looked as though they have been sitting there for three days. I sampled a few but did not finish. The seafood - I did not dare. The salad bar I have at my work cafeteria looked more happening. I'm 100% sure there is nothing wrong with the food, but for this price, impression is everything.  2. The atmosphere: For a Friday night, it was 25% occupied. This place was once great --  and it once had huge crowds and a wait list. They were sitting people close together that night and near the entrance to help make it appear packed. Old and sad.  3. The meats: I came in very hungry, but ended up eating only a few slices  of each and just stopped. Texas de Brazil had meat that was tender and steaming hot! Brasa, on the other hand, had them warm, which is not enough, and thus, went cold on my plate quicker. The meats did not taste like prime cuts and required a bit more chewing. (Ok, it's not fair that I visit prime steakhouses often, but for gods sake, I've had outback steak more tender than this.) I had the rib, the flank steak, the sirloin, pork rib, sausage, chicken. I never saw the better cuts like filet mignon. The pork rib had a freezer-burn after taste and was the worst. The sausage was the best of the bunch.  4. The price: For this price, you will get better tasting, better flavored, more tender beef at ugh, chain restaurants, like Cheesecake Factory and Outback. If your intention is to get stuffed, then the return of investment might be worth it. I feel like they are trying to survive financially, resulting in shortcuts, and cost-cutting at the expense of quality.  5. Other food, service: Sadly, the side dishes were the best part. I loved the fried polenta and the fried bananas. Even more sadly, the side dishes came in, midway through the meal. They had this \"spice\" on the side, meant to be added to the meat -- it tasted like salty breadcrumbs and did not improve things much. The car valet service was excellent though. I always tip 20% despite service, our waitress got the job done, but looked sad and tired.  I wanted it to be good, because the experience I had at that out-of-town Texas de Brazil, was epic and memorable.  In summary, if a beef fix is what you need, you might be better of going to a prime steakhouse. The place is a candidate for the Restaurant rehab reality show at food network."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely delicious. Superior service. This is a really classy place. Great for a special occasion or for a date. :)"}
{"text":"First of all, I am not one to over hype.  Yes, this is an excellent place to experience. I live 2 hours away but I plan to make visits periodically if unable to move there.   Although this was my first Brazilian steakhouse experience, I fell in love quickly. Now, my experience came from the Bar side and the service received was impeccable.   The Bar experience you choose a plate of 4 meats and this was very satisfying. The cheese bread was awesome. In addition, we ordered one of their specials from the Sushi menu called Lil' Delicious and I was instantly hooked. Essentially, it is a fried sushi--spicy tuna, etc. All I know is that when you go, make sure you order this period.   I loved the drink menu--enjoyed the fresh Sangria and a few other drinks I am unable to name but they were so well made and refreshing.   You have to go and experience this place--end of story. Just enjoy it and smile.  Angie was the best."}
{"text":"Overpriced and mediocre food. Also ripped off from a required reservation fee required for a large group that was a few people short of the original estimate. The $110 reservation fee was forfeited and manager refused to refund, even though we brought 14 people to their restaurant. Don't eat here!"}
{"text":"the bartender made limeade instead of a caipirinha. it was so sugary and disgusting. they only had one bartender on a busy Saturday night and it seemed like it was her first time behind a bar.   people have reservations and they are seating them about 2 hours behind. it's bit that busy it just seems like they have no idea what they are doing here.  food was just meh."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Brasa for a long time. A family member bought me a gift card probably because he knew I wouldn't spend $45 on it myself.  I have to say I enjoyed the experience but I wasn't impressed with the service, and thought that the quality of the food could have been better. We came in on a Saturday evening and when we walked in the door no one greeted us even though there were two employees standing in a hallway near the door. Finally after a few minutes one of them came up to the door to ask if we had a reservation.   Our waitress was friendly, but there were several others who came to our table who were less than enthusiastic about being there, and the weirdest thing was how the servers just stood in a corner and watched. I felt uncomfortable being watched over the entire meal. They came over way too frequently to ask if we were enjoying the food.  I don't think I would come back a second time, I would rather pay $45 for a smaller, but really good meal elsewhere.  It's fine to try it once though."}
{"text":"Been coming here for about 6 years.  It's a solid place for birthdays or celebrations.  The uniqueness of the restaurant is what keeps us coming back.  The brazilian steakhouse concept is fun, although expensive.  Out of the dozen or so times we've been here we only had 1 negative experience and that was when we had a party of 10 on a Saturday night for my fiancee and her twin sister's birthday.  The service was slow and our table was barely getting any attention from the waiter or the gentlemen carrying the meat skewers.  We voiced our displeasure to the manager and they gave us a round of special drinks as well as an entire dessert platter for the table.  It was nice to see that they understood that we were trying to enjoy a nice evening out and they did what they could at that point to remedy.  I will continue to patronize this location but if another location of the same variety opened up in the area I would definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"My experience was Great. The meats needs to be flavored a little bit. I like 2 meats only - the sirloin and the rib!!"}
{"text":"I wish I can give this place 3 1/2 stars because the service was good, the meats were good, the buffet was good, the decor was good, but the sides...they can have.  If I ever have the chance and money, I'd go again. Maybe pace myself a little more, but my friends insisted to go with the meats even before I could get to the buffet!"}
{"text":"All-You-Can-Eat MEAT!!!  Seriously, this place this is for the MEAT-minded, carnivore, Adkins Dieter, animal-lover (in not that cuddly, petting sort of way), or whatever similar term works.  Vegetarians need not apply!  Gluttony at its finest!  For $40/person, not only do you get to sit on your duff and be served by a small army of waiters, a continuous train of spit-roasted meat arrives at your table to be carved onto your dish until you flip your stop card.  Could it get any better than this?  (Maybe lounging on a daybed, fanned by a team of scantily-clad women like Caligula?  Other than that, I can't think of anything else that would make this better!)  On this visit we had 13 choices (I've heard this number varies per day... a friend mentioned it was 14 when he was there a few days prior).  Today's drive-by train of gluttony included bacon-wrapped filet, bacon-wrapped turkey medallions, steak, roast beef, roast lamb, and lamb chops, sausage links, smoked ham, and more.  Our absolute favorite were the lamb chops and roast beef!  The massive appetizer bar had a lot of choices - 4 long tables-worth of cured meats, cheeses, prepared salads, pasta & seafood dishes - that were quite delicious!  I'd pay just to go to the appetizer bar ($30 for salad bar only).  But remember, this is a gastronomic distraction (filler) to what you came here for today: MEAT!  They have a sushi menu as well - sushi is 1/2-off on Mondays.  Again, a distraction from MEAT!  So despite \"preparing\" ourselves (not eating anything all day), we were barely able to squeak through 2 rotations.  (See TIP below...)  Food was great and we'll definitely be back!  But with a bill for $120.68 for 2 people before tip (2 drinks, 2 dinners, 2 desserts), the next time we visit we're eating & drinking MEAT ONLY!  TIP: I've heard the thing to do is eat a large breakfast to stretch the stomach... and nothing else all day until Brasa!  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Server (Lexi) was great - but the kitchen/gouchos had a couple issues. First, the meat was cooked at too low of a temperature so it wasn't crisped salt like most others. Second, we went 10-15 minutes with no meat despite the gouchos walking by our table, so we had to ask our server, and we still did not get the full menu to stop by our table. For a Brazilian steakhouse at 45$ a plate I was overall disappointed. We made it a point to try one in each place we have traveled so we have seen a wide array. I would rate this one below Fogo De Chao and above the one we tried in Asheville making it a solid 3. Not recommended to friends or family."}
{"text":"Food was great. The actual servers wete wonderful.  However, the management staff wad rude and not helpful in accommodating our party.  All part of the dining experience."}
{"text":"Who would have thought - A Brazilian Steakhouse with fantastic Sushi? Does that even make sense? Who cares - it's true!   To avoid smelling like meat the rest of the night, I would recommend sitting outside and enjoying the beautiful Warehouse District Neighborhood. The ambiance is especially stellar on a nice evening."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for sub par food. $300!for 4 people including tip Went here with friends. My wife who travels to Brazil on business wanted to compare it to the grills there. I must start with a disclaimer. I don't eat meat. The other guests do. I did not like this place very much. First off it is not very clean. Bugs in the light fixtures dirty bathroom with flowers in a vase with brown water. Needless to say not much attention to detail.  I ate food from the buffet. Nothing special. No Brazilian dishes just the usual shrimp salmon salads and misc random items. Lasagna at a Brazilian place? The meat was tough according to the carnivores. They come around with meat on a big skewer   supposedly 19 different kinds.  Only saw about 6. The sides were pretty good. Rice and beans fried bananas and these little dough balls.  But $45 is a lot for tough meat and ho-him salad bar  Drinks were good. Dessert tray had a sample of dried up flan on it. Again no attention to detail. Service was way too attentive. Must have been asked 20 times by 4 different people if we wanted our plates removed.  It was hard to tell who our server was. If it weren't for the good cocktail and decent side dishes I would have given this place one star"}
{"text":"If I didn't have a Groupon, I would have been pissed to pay full price for that meal. The salad bar was alright, but not $30/person alright. The meat that I tried was good, but not mind blowing. I also felt like the same 5 different types of meat kept stopping by our table, and I would have appreciated more variety. The sides of plantain, polenta, and white rice were good, but not exciting and lacked any spice. The sauce and spices offered with the meat was also dull. When I asked for hot sauce to jazz it up all they had was tabasco. All in all, it was okay, but totally over priced for what you're getting."}
{"text":"So after being convinced by my (more forgiving than I) boyfriend to give this place another shot since our Groupon was good for another weekend, we went back a second time.  The staff was friendly, but our waitress never explained anything about how the whole experience works; thankfully we've been to a similar restaurant before and knew what was going on. The wine selection was great, lots of variety and about half were in the $25 to $40/bottle range. The food came around at a good pace, but about half of the cuts of meat were extremely fatty and of moderate (or slightly less) quality. The other half were delicious and of good quality, but we both agreed on one thing - everything was WAY over salted.  The salad bar was dismal at best. There were 2 seafood options - cocktail shrimp and some sort of cooked oysters. Both were room temperature and looked (and tasted) like they had been sitting out a while. The rest of the salad bar consisted of salad & fixings, a few cooked and raw veggie choices, pasta salad, cheese and crackers, and a lasagna. My boyfriend said the lasagna was pretty good, but almost everything except for the salad had some sort of cheese in it. For those of us who can't have dairy, it would have been nice to have a few more options to eat other than sketchy seafood, lettuce, and asparagus.  Overall, the food was 50/50 but the service was good. Our first experience at a Brasa (in Niagara Falls) FAR exceeded this one. If you're looking for a fantastic Brazilian steakhouse experience, go there if you're in the area. As for this location, we won't be back and I wouldn't recommend this to my family and friends, especially for the $40/person price. Save yourself the time and money and go to a real steakhouse instead."}
{"text":"I could not decide between a one and a two ... Ended up with two.  Just went and had an unfortunate meal. We walk in early and they were accommodating because our reservation was still fifteen minutes out. As we were being escorted to the table I realized the floor was quite greasy. Just armed my wife to be careful. We sat at the table and I had to wipe off all of be knives because they certainly were not clean. The waitress was nice but we had to ask for plates.   Note that we do not eat pork so I am not commenting on any of that. I have always loved Brazilian steak houses. I did not have one great piece of steak. They had a good variety but the meat was quite bland except  for he occasional crunch of salt. The plantains and other standard items brought to the table were quite salty. Both of my children who had and typically love lamb said it was horrible.   Before tip and with only drinking water the bill came to about $200 which is fair for his type of meal with excellent beef. This was not good sadly."}
{"text":"Being 18 I am always skeptical of \"fancy\" restaurants because they tend to snub teens or young adults. This however was not the case at Brasa.   I decided to take my boyfriend here for his birthday. I used their open table app for the first time and it was super easy! Especially because I made a reservation for 15. We used the valet service which was great!  The staff had a large table ready for us and we're exceptionally friendly. The manager himself took care of our table. He was very friendly and always cracking jokes! They never let our waters or other drinks get below halfway. The food was phenomenal and they had a great selection!! We had to flip red a couple of times because the meat was coming out too fast. I was impressed. The staff engaged with us to making us feel very welcome and even like family.   And seeing as this was a birthday, they brought us out dessert free of charge. It had happy birthday written on it and everyone sang. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"When talking about a Brazilian steakhouse, I think it bears repeating: my husband is Argentine.  His family is from Argentina, he spent part of his childhood there, and he LOVES meat.  So, when we were new to Ohio and told about Brasa, we were thrilled.  Sadly, the thrill didn't last.    Our company was delightful, the service was decent, the atmosphere was swanky, but the lighting was so dim it was a challenge to see what we were eating.. and each other, for that matter.  The salad bar was fun and interesting.  But, the meat (the main event).. most of it was overcooked!  The horror.  Maybe it was because we came on a Sunday?    We couldn't be sure, but sadly the meat wasn't what we expected.  For the price you pay, and the days you've given up eating so you can stomach your annual quota of animal flesh, you want it to be worth it.  The jury is still out on this one."}
{"text":"Going in, I'd never done Brazillian.  As a bonified carnivore, I personally enjoyed this place...the meat train in here veritably does not stop rolling! However, I made the unfortunate error of bringing someone there who I later found out was functionally vegetarian.  I felt pretty bad about that...as I consumed just about every meat option.   While the buffet spread options are more than descent, the cost doesn't make Brasa a great choice if you're not a meat eater ($25-$35 per). Beyond that, the restaurant had good (prompt, although not the friendliest) service, and a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Dinner is one of my favorites in the city, though pricey. However, brunch? Skip it! Not worth the $40 tag. Still gets 4 stars out of me because of my joyful dinner experiences."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, I was blown away by the service, meat, seafood available and atmosphere.  I got crab legs and shrimp from the buffet as well as countless plates of top sirloin, filet Mignon wrapped in bacon, Parmesan crusted steak and countless others.  I loved every minute of it.    The second time I have to say I was a bit let down.  My server was great, very attentive but the buffet wasn't the same.  There was no crab legs or shrimp.  There was mussels though.  But, I was expecting to start out my meal with SEAFOOD!!! The meat came around like before but I felt the service was a bit slower this time.  We also noticed that some of the meat, especially the fillet Mignon wrapped in bacon, a favorite from before, was dry and not as tasty.  The waiter was helpful though because we asked him if he could get us a rare piece, which he did.  That piece was fantastic though.  The thing I LOVED about this time is that they had chicken heart, which is one of my favorites.  I think I had 5, the pork ribs were also pretty good this time as well.  Overall I would call and make sure they have crab legs and shrimp before I go next time to get my money's worth.  I would also suggest looking for groupons as this is an expensive meal for the normal couple."}
{"text":"My family and I have been to Brasa quite a few times. We used to love it. This time the food was still amazing but the service was terrible. The restaurant was practically empty on a Friday night and it felt like we were being pushed out. My brother who loves to eat wanted more and it took 40 minutes for him to get more meat, even though our card was green. Our waitress was bringing checks out and he said \"I'm not done, I would like more.\" And she looked at him like he was crazy and it still took 10 minutes for him to get more. We were there for 3 hours, simply because for the steep price of $45 dollars a plate we wanted to get our money's worth. When we're finally done and ready to go it took 20 minutes to get our checks back to sign. Needless to say the food is amazing but we will be finding a new Brazilian steak house for next time."}
{"text":"There is a sense of magic about flipping over a small card and making meat appear.  A sense of glee at summoning eager people armed with meat-laden swords and big knives, ready to carve hunks of fleshy goodness onto your plate.  So Brasa starts with a star just for the awesomeness of concept, even if that concept isn't original.    The meal starts with a trip around the highly competent salad bar, a place one should approach warily - filling up on salad is a real danger.  The salad bar also includes curried chicken, mahi in a coconut sauce, and a decent seafood selection.  It is obviously the compromise offer for non-meat eaters - you know, like the hamburger that's on the menu of every Chinese restaurant - and it's a good, if spendy, option for the person dragged along to a group meal.  But don't try to convince your flesh-avoiding boyfriend that this makes Brasa a good date destination.  After the salad bar, the magic card is flipped and the meat begins to arrive.  The first couple slices you receive might seem skimpy, but there is a reason for that: with about 13 varieties of sword-borne meat coming your way, it won't take long for you to fill up.  Once you've had the smaller tastes of the offerings, you become picky, dismissing seconds of less-favored items in favor of better offerings.  The flavor of the meats varies considerably.  Brasa handles beef particularly well, pork not nearly so.  The sirloin, parmesan-crusted tenderloin, and prime rib are all excellent.  The Brazilian pork sausage is also very good.  On the night we were there, the pork tenderloin was bland, and the pork ribs tough and dry.  The bacon-wrapped turkey was dry, and the bacon used for both it and the bacon-wrapped fillet was flabby and overly salty.  The leg of lamb was excellent, and the lamp chops tasty if a bit too well done.    The atmosphere of the restaurant is toned-down elegance, but the dining room tends to be noisy.  The food is good, but I have to wonder where there is anything \"Brazilian\" about the menu other than the serving technique and the fried bananas.  There is plenty to eat that's tasty and fresh, though, and it's a nice treat."}
{"text":"Service was horrible.  We sat for 30 min at our table with no drinks and someone had to go say something!  The food is decent (if you can get served), if there was a zero star option i would give it that.  Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"This is the most seasoned steak and chicken that I've tasted in a restaurant! I was very satisfied with my meal and experience. Definitely price but worth it. The atmosphere is romantic but not stuffy, families can dine without feeling awkward. The staff was very friendly, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Returned to Brasa Grill this week, for our 28th wedding anniversary. We were disappointed that Briana had lost her voice! She was there and could only whisper. Poor Briana. However, the food was just as good as last time. And, Francis (one of the servers) had the chicken hearts we loved so much for us again, upon special request. Another outstanding meal. One thing to note is that this type of cooking (the meats) means salt. If saltiness offends your palette, this isn't your restaurant."}
{"text":"Third time here . I haven't been here since 2012 and nothing has changed . Great food great hospitality! Even tho we stayed a few mins past closing all employees were inviting and superb . Shout out to Santos!! He was the all star !"}
{"text":"I had heard quite a bit about this place, so I thought I'd give it a try this weekend.  We made reservations through Open Table for 7:00 on Friday night and were seated promptly upon arriving.  Our waitress quickly came over to explain the process to us since it was our first time dining there.  We immediately went to the buffet which had everything from ravioli, salad, mussels, shrimp, rice, etc.  Right when we returned to our table, they started bringing the assortment of meats.  I actually had to turn the card over to red because we couldn't keep up!  Although the restaurant is pricey, it is well worth it.  There is a variety of food for everyone and the service was fantastic.  I will definitely be returning sometime this summer."}
{"text":"Brasa is a good Brazilian-style grilled meat restaurant. The salad bar offers a decent choice of sides and the quality of the meat is very good. Being Portuguese I always lived overexposed to Brazilian restaurants with a similar concept and top top quality, they try to do that genre here, but don't totally get there.  Wine selection is nice, with some very good options you can not find in other places (loved that I could find red Douro in Cleveland downtown).  The staff is very good, they work their way so you'll always have the tasty juicy meat on your plate, and how much you eat is just up to you.  So, you can give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is a horror, if you are an animal rights activist or if you want a  cheap dining experience. Otherwise read on.  Brasa Grill Steakhouse is not really a steakhouse in the traditional American sense. It is of the Brazilian flair (Churrascaria). So here's what it means. It's a pseudo buffet style eatery. The starters such as salad and other side dishes are on a buffet in the middle. You get an assortment of good food here that you really don't want to fill up on. On the night I went: cocktail shrimp, green beans, pasta salad and more was served.  Next comes a carnivore's heaven or a PETA member's nightmare on a stick! Servers with meat on skewers walk up to your table and announces the type and cut. You either drool and use your tongs to grab the slice he cuts for you right there and then or you can pass. Needless to say, I drooled a lot that night. Protein Oh Protein. I love thou on skewer. Meathead, art thy servant, I shalt be thy chewer. It's ok to be picky. Really. If you hear a cut of meat you rather pass, just simply pass. I do advise checking out the list they have up front (ask host or hostess) so you can plan your South American cuisine venture  Here's a few things to note: Our waitress brought out some cheese bread that were 2 inch diameter goodness when we first sat down which we promptly consumed. These little poppers are wonderful and will go well with some of the dishes from the buffet. So save some for after you've visited the buffet (or ask for more). Our Waitress also brought out some fried plantain, fries, rice, crunchy meat seasoning and salsa for our table but she did so a little late into our dinner. So be sure to ask for those to compliment your meats before they arrive.  Other then that, be sure to bring mulah.  It's pricy but well worth it."}
{"text":"I have been to other Brazilian steakhouses and Brasa Grill left me unimpressed. The most notable thing compared to other places is for the same price, you get less choices for both meat and salad bars at Brasa.  I went with colleagues at work on a busy hours and the service was a bit disappointing. The meat was a hit or miss. They seem to be overcooked when you want medium rare/medium. For the price you paid only on the salad bars, the selections were lackluster. I mean cocktail shrimp that I can just buy from grocery store? Come on!  Also, they need to do a better job of stopping at the table when we requested for meat. It was either they walked past our tables or it took them 10 min to bring out each meat. Not to mention same type of meat when they advertise something like 15+ types of meat. You'd have to ask waiter for a special request of the meat you want. I would recommend Fogo de Chao over this place if you want better Brazillian steakhouses experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our one year anniversary. We brought our 4 month old baby with us because we don't have anyone to watch her. We timed it around her nap, so she would sleep while we ate dinner. She was sleeping when we got there, but our waitress decided to shout,\" oh, I love babies\"! Right next to my daughter's head. She woke up and started screaming. I had to take her into the restroom to nurse her (also, no changing tables), she finally calmed down. My husband and I took turns holding her because we couldn't get her back to sleep. It took our waitress 15 minutes to come back over and ask us what we wanted to drink. During the course of our meal, we only got one refill. She only came back a couple times. The meat selection wasn't as advertised. Only a few to choose from. Most of it was dry and salty, they also didn't come around much. Our plates were empty the majority of the time. We ordered desert, it took 20 minutes to bro it out and left much to be desired. My advice, save your money and go to a nice steakhouse. This place wasn't worth $45 per person."}
{"text":"So my wonderful wife decided to take me to a Brazilian steakhouse as I really like them. Sadly though, this is the only one we have in the Cleveland area.    Brasa is supposed to be like FdC but it is far from it.  The salad bar was ok.  Nothing special and it was not the freshest.  The service was far from what I expected and we went on a quiet night!  Servers were rare and the service was slow.  The meat....so that is the reason people come to these places.  Unfortunately, the cuts were very dry and not flavorful.  They also didn't have many choices. Over the course of the night, we had only 6 different cuts.  Versus the dozen plus the talk about.     Overall, I was not impressed at all.  Going back....nope.  Not unless the night we went was a real fluke."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Brasa but second to a Brazilian Barbecue. I enjoyed my first visit, which was to Kravings in Los Angeles a couple months ago.  I used the online reservation system through Open Table, which worked perfectly. We arrived a few minutes early and used the $8 valet. We checked in and were seated immediately.  We ordered drinks then hit the buffet line for some fillers. I was disappointed in the overall selection, as Kravings was loaded with sushi and several other choices. Brasa seemed more limited to some side salads and a few other appetizers.  The meats were all very good although I'm not a fan of lamb in general, so that one I didn't finish. The steaks and ribs were excellent and the servers were on point.  At times there were too many meats on my plate and we had to flip the card to stop the service for a bit.  My wife loved her cinnamon peach martini and I had a Guinness.  We shared a chocolate mousse for dessert.  Overall, it was a great visit and we'll return."}
{"text":"This is the worst brazillian food I have ever had.   The meat has no flavor and the service is poor."}
{"text":"This place was disappointing.  So first, if you've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, then it's still worth going here just for the experience.  I mean, gauchos come up to your table and slice meat onto your plate from a massive stick.  How COOL is that???  This restaurant is not so bad that you should miss out altogether.  But anyway, I personally have been to such a place before, and this one fell short for the following reasons: 1) The salad bar was kind of pathetic.  In a good Brazilian steakhouse, you could make a meal out of the salad bar food - this one just had a couple of cold dishes that weren't too appetizing. 2) Some of meats were too salty, some were too chewy, some were a little dry.  A few were good. 3) There were not that many people here.  We went on a Saturday night, but only a few tables here and there were filled .  Part of the experience of a good Brazilian steakhouse is the atmosphere that is created by the voracious diners around you.  If anything, they should've seated everyone closer together. 4) The waiters came in waves.  I expected basically an endless stream of meat, but what happened here was maybe four waiters came at once, and then we waited for 20 minutes for more meat to come.  I suspect that they are understaffed, and the 20 minute wait between waves represented the time that the four waiters took to make their way around the restaurant full circle."}
{"text":"Compare to the last time I went about 2 years ago, the food in salad bar has a lot less selection than before. But the meat selection is about the same and are very good. All together, it's more than I can eat anyway. Still love this place. Service is very good too!"}
{"text":"Went to celebrate Father's Day with my family. Service was poor, several items on the salad bar were empty when we got there and we're never replaced the entire time we were there! Meat was bland and either under or overcooked. I notified waiter who said he'd let management know and thanks for telling him...and then proceeded to bring us the overpriced bill. A restaurant as expensive as this should never have empty spots on the salad bar and service should be prompt. We should have had part of our bill discounted for our experience. I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"My experience here:  Salad bar, meat meat meat meat meat meat meat meat.  Stomach full, gut busted.  The salad bar consists of shrimp cocktail, assorted salad items such as hearts of palm, marinated artichoke and mushroom, mussels, and a giant pot of feijoada.  The bread that is served at your table is unique and delicious- little discs of chewy cheesy bread served warm at your table.  They also give you a selection of condiments and sides at your table- farofa (toasted, ground grain), marinated chopped onions, fried yucca and banana croquettes.    The concept itself makes it kind of like the Brazilian version of dim sum.  People coming around with food items that you get to choose from for your meal.  The meat itself, pretty tender and juicy.  We tried 8 out of the 12-14 meats that are available (sausage, chicken, ribs, various cuts of beef, etc.), and found that the beef items were the best tasting out of the selections we were presented.  The price?  $35 all you can eat including salad bar.  The wait?  We had reservations here on a Saturday night and we had to wait ~20 minutes or so for our table to be ready.  They were packed that night!"}
{"text":"All-you-can-eat grilled meat for ~$50 including tip, without dessert or drinks.  I've been to a few Brazilian steakhouses in several big cities.  The experience at a Brazilian steakhouse is always amazing, but compared to the other places I've been to, I would say that Brasa is average.  Meat choices range from chicken legs and pork sausages to various cuts of steak.  I thought the leg of lamb was particularly good.  Lamb served in cheaper restaurants often has a gamy taste, which often keeps me from ordering it.  The leg of lamb at Brasa was seasoned and cooked well enough for me not to notice any gamy taste. In terms of steak, you have your choice between cuts of filet mignon, flank steak, and sirloin. I feel that I've had higher quality cuts of beef at other Brazilian steakhouses.  There could also be some improvement in terms of the salad bar and side dishes.  While the fried plantains were good, they were accompanied with french fries.  At other Brazilian steakhouses, I've had other more authentic sides to go with the meat.  The bread served was mediocre. I thought the salad bar could have had more variety, considering that you can have the salad bar only for a slightly lower price. On a positive note, there are quite a few seafood entrees available in the \"buffet area\", including an abundance of crab legs, stuffed mussels, and cocktail shrimp.  All in all, if you've been to another Brazilian steakhouse before, you may not be wowed.  The experience will still be enjoyable though.  If you haven't been to a Brazilian steakhouse and love meat, you will definitely have a good time."}
{"text":"Omg I love love love this place! They are pretty pricey but we'll worth it. The \"buffet\" is more of a salad bar with pasta options and people don't go for that at least I don't that's just a plus! I love the parmesean garlic crusted fillet it's to die for nothing like it! I always have them come around with it a couple of times! The place is a bit pricey and the ambience calls for more than jeans unless you've dressed t hem up but I've gone casual and it's acceptable."}
{"text":"Wait staff is incredibly prompt. If you are a stickler for service you won't be disappointed, black ties for everyone. However the floor is some sort of slippery material and more than 1 staff slipped and slid kind of strange. Salad bar offers more than salad including sno crab which was excellent, but no cocktail sauce or melted butter was out there for dipping. Maybe could have asked for it.could taste the salty sea water which is rare for not living next to an ocean! The little doughy cheese balls they put on your table off the bat are incredible and different. But the star of the show the meat, was good not great. BC they slice off of a skewer you are at the mercy of them on the temp unless you speak up which I wish I'd have done. If your the 1st table they get to you will obv get a cut from the outside which will be more well done and who wants that? Selection is ok don't expect to get all the filet or prime rib you want, expect top sirloin, ham, chicken, sausage too. Sides of rice, pinto beans were no good, mashed potatoes were awesome. Dessert options were fantastic but are not included in the 45$ dinner which we didn't know until the bill came. 10$ a piece which brought the bill for 2 to 120$ w no alcohol. It's Not worth going back but not disappointed I went for the 1st time. I feel most people would say the same thing. Hard to believe they have regulars willing to pony up for a sliver of the good cuts and not even get it cooked to the temp you want unless u get lucky. More of a 1 time thing, to say you tried something different."}
{"text":"I thought I'd give them another go, after a horrid experience on my first visit, thinking perhaps they just had an off night. I was sooo hopeful, trying to capture the wonderment of the Brasa Steakhouse, in Raleigh, NC I visited last year. Sad to say, the second go was an identical replay of the first visit, minus the request we not wait at the bar.  Here is how our evening went:   Despite arriving on time for our reservations for 8pm on a Saturday night, we weren't seated until 9:30pm.   Since they had no available table, we were told we could sit at the bar. But, when we sat at the bar, we were told my 13 year old couldn't sit there, due to an Ohio law. This was a total fabrication and I told the bartender there was no such law. Then she said it was Brasa policy that no kids sit there, stating the bar was valuable real-estate on a Saturday night. (((WTF?))) So, we stood and waited by the door. Occasionally, the hostess apologized for the mix-up at the bar and the fact we had to stand, because they had no seating for waiting families.  When we were finally seated, we perused the salad bar, which had some nice offerings, but some of the food on it had been sitting untouched for some time and was dried out. There were also quite a few empty dishes.  When a server brought our beverages, I inquired about the empty selections on the salad bar, and was told they would be filling them. I again asked, when the first \"Groucho\" arrived with some sausages. I was told it wasn't his job and didn't know.   When I saw the server who brought us beverages, I asked again, about the empty dishes. At that point, she stated they were not going to refill the bar, because it was past 10pm. But she was sure we would enjoy the meal, nonetheless.  We finished what was on our plates and waited .Mind you, we could see a half-dozen Gauchos trolling about. Just not near our table.  And, we waited...  Finally, two Gauchos arrived at the same time; one with pork loin and one with Turkey!  I don't like turkey, so I took some pork and asked about steak.  One of the Gauchos said steak would be around.   So, I finished the pork and I waited. Then, I waited some more...  At this point, we'd been sitting at our table for an hour, and maybe ingested 8 oz of meat, if that.The next time we saw meat, it was beef they said was fillet mignon (yeah, right) with a garlic coating, but I swear it was sirloin. I asked for an extra helping, because I was worried that was all the beef I'd get. I was right, too.  The Gauchos brought around more sausage, more turkey, more sausage, most of which I turned away since I wanted more beef. Needless to say, more beef never came.   We ended up leaving because my family was tired of waiting 20 minutes between servings. This place scored a 10/10 on the ridiculous scale!  Well played, Brasa! You got me twice! I will never succumb to your meaty wiles again, I can assure you."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed by the flavor of the food, the meat seamed under flavored and we were half way through our dinners before we received our bread and other sides."}
{"text":"At first impression I was a bit disappointed   The whole point of making a reservation is to be seated on time and not stand like cattle by the door. I got here a bit early and checked in. I was told 10 minutes. Those passed and I had to wait 10 more. That process was entirely too painful.  Once seated, and the staff made their way to our table, the food was quite delicious. Wonderful cuts of beef paired with good flavors. The massive salad bar is, if nothing else, interesting. Lots to fill up on.  Food gets high marks. I rate the service OK."}
{"text":"This is an easy review. \"FANTASICALLY MEMORABLE WITH A FLAIR FOR DECOR AND SERVICE\""}
{"text":"Food was good and service was very friendly. The reason there isn't a 5 star given is the point going to a Brazilian style steakhouse is so you can flip the coaster to green or red letting them know if you want any more cuts of meat. I'm there on business and we're trying to have conversations but they kept stopping by and interrupting even when we had the red coaster displayed.  Need a few more selections for side items on the hot side but the ones there were very good.  Dinner for two and a couple of drinks $227.67 not counting tip. Be prepared to spend but it's worth it"}
{"text":"Similar to cafeteria food on the salad bar, nothing really to talk about there. The meat smorgasbord was overwhelming in volume and very underwhelming in flavor and preparation. Most all of the meats were overcooked. A few that had a chance were not seasoned. This was my first visit to a place like this and while the service was excellent, we felt shorted on value for price. The sides served on the table were rice, a vinegar salsa, and fries with breaded and deep fried bananas. Plantains would have been more authentic and not hard to prepare. Save your money."}
{"text":"This is the worst  churasscaria I have ever been to. I'm from New York and I know what a good Brazilian steakhouse is. They are VERY OVERPRICED. You would think at forty dollars a pop,they would have a bigger selection. Very odd tasting meats and they only bought out 3 or 4 differents meats.  Salad bar was limited and quite pathetic . I knew we should've walked out when we saw the place was half empty. My poor brother shelled out over 400 dollars for 7 people,no drinks or dessert. I give them 6 months before they close. Good riddance!"}
{"text":"I would have to say food was good but service was horrible.   The waitress was rude, asked for seperate bills before we ordered.  When we were done she stated she was tobusy to seperate the check.  After we asked for the manager and waited 20 minutes only for her to return to say the mmanager was to busy to talk with us and with attitude seperated our bill.  The buffet is also half of what it used to be."}
{"text":"We came here for date night with high expectations, everyone was telling us how unique this place was. Well let me tell you it was one of a kind, but we were definitely let down.  I had a reservation for two for 7 on a Saturday. I made the reservation weeks in advanced so I was a little upset when we did not get seated until 8 o'clock! They sent us to the bar which I was fine with, but after waiting a whole hour when I had reservations, left a bad taste in my mouth. The seating arrangements were really confusing and had no rhyme or reason to them.  The second let down of the night was the salad bar, sure it had some high points like fresh mozzarella and shrimp but it was nothing spectacular.  The saving grace was the skewered style meat service! What a fun unique take on a dining experience! The meat came around kind of slow but it gave us time to digest! The only ones we did not like were the pork loin and the sausage, I think we tried a total of 11 different meats. The filet was mouth watering! Other favorites were the flank steak, beef rib, and sirloin. This was a good experience but with all the bad points I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for his birthday. It was a very nice experience with friendly staff. Service was very good !   We did not try the salad bar, but we got the dinner experience. Most of the food was good, but some of the cuts of meat were very dry. The pork cuts were dry all of the cheaper cuts of meat were lacking in flavor. I paid $134 for dinner and I was given A1 sauce to flavor my meat... That was a huge turnoff. The filet and top sirloin cuts were good, but I could do without the sausage, chicken or turkey. Lamb was very dry as well.   Just a little advice, turn down the earlier cuts of meat they bring out first. Don't waste your appetite on cheap and dry turkey or sausage. Save it for the prime rib, sirloin etc that they tend to serve at the end. It's better and they wait to serve this to save $$ and not over serve expensive cuts. The side dishes are delicious as well.   Dessert was very nice as they gave us a free plate of flan with a candle for my husbands birthday. Overall a nice night... Too expensive for what it was."}
{"text":"This place is hard to rate because it's quite different. Generally good to great, with a few issues.  The Bottom Line  Go, but It would be good to have a groupon or some other deal.  Ask for a better table away from crammed areas if possible. Hit the Salad Bar, but don't get much and limit to the good stuff (cheese and some seafood. )   THE GOOD -The concept is real fun.  Delicious Meat on skewers gets delivered to your table; I'd imagine that's what they do in heaven.   -Most of the Meats were good. A few were quite amazing, like the Bacon wrapped fillet.  Most were juicy with good flavor, with some exceptions. -Service was good. Flip the card and it was a constant barrage of meat (if they could fight your way to the table, more below). Oddly enough, in terms of service and food quality it is probably better to go there when they are busy because while the place was full, there were a ton of servers about , there seemed to be more variety, and the meat doesn't sit around on skewers to long. .  -Drink list was good and prices seemed reasonable. We got a pitcher of Sangria, which ended up being more like a tank of Sangria. One of the better alcohol values I've ever had in a restaurant. - The table \"fixing\" were a nice touch , and the plantain and polenta were a perfect addition.  THE MEH's - The famed salad bar. This one is tough to pin down. On one hand you good mid scale items like goat cheese, oysters and shrimp. Some of the salad mixes were nice too. On other hand some of the stuff looked like it belongs in a lower end Vegas buffet.  Good, but no way I'd pay anywhere near the $30 they are asking for it alone.  A little quince paste or jam and some fruit would make it perfect for the rest of the meal though - A few of the Meats weren't that great or had little going on with them. The Turkey I had was bone dry, and some of the other cuts were chewy. Also could have had some grilled shrimp to lighten up a bit.. - Price is steep. For $40 the experience is fun, but the quality is not quite there.  For that same price you could go to a Bruell joint and get a 3 course meal were everything is top of the line (very little \"Meh's)   THE UGLY -Seating. Now this might depend on where you are but on the south end of the restaurant were we sat, tables were completely jammed making it uncomfortable. If they got rid of 1 or 2 tables and rearranged it would be \"cozy\", but what they have is ridiculous.  I realize that extra table is revenue, but There was no space to walk (servers were constantly waiting to navigate through the mess), and your chairs but up against other chairs or tables. Worst of all, even though the restaurant was \"full\" (people were turned away) tables sat empty from the time we sat down to the time we left. They might not have to reserve a tables for 2 hours If they actually yanked out a table or two, as servers would be able to move quicker, and people might actually get out of there faster  (A little Six Sigma would be good here)"}
{"text":"Great stuff going on in downtown Cleveland, great setting, great decor, great presentation. However, the entire experience was underwhelming as the meat dishes were to salty and the buffet seem to be lacking sauces and condiments."}
{"text":"I am comparing this place to one of my favorite restaurant experiences, so this review might sound harsh, but I have had much better. This place works the same as your traditional Brazilian steak house w/ the red & green card and a salad bar to start. The salad bar was kind of what a normal salad bar is like, nothing really special. Once you flip your card, the meat starts coming. The night we were there, we were told there were 15 meats. I didn't try every meat (having learned to wait for the ones I was really interested in) however the meats I remember were: top sirloin, sirloin, garlic & parmesean filet mignon, bacon wrapped turkey, bacon wrapped chicken wings, filet mignon, sausage, chicken thighs, pork tenderloin, leg of lamb....I can't remember the rest, but I was probably too full to pay attention by this point. Unfortunately, several of the meats (filet in particular) were over-cooked to a medium + doneness, and all but the top sirloin were comletely under-seasoned. We finished with desserts, and I had the passion fruit creme brulee, which was delicious. If you haven't eaten at a place like this before, it is worth going for the novelty. I have been to another place like this, in fact, much better than this, but luckily, the company picked up the tab, so it didn't upset me too much."}
{"text":"It's good, but not as good as a Fogo De Chao. The brazilian BBQ in Buckhead Georgia and Austin Texas is way better. Since there is no other Brazilian BBQ in Cleveland this will fulfill your brazillian BBQ cravings. The creme brûlée was very good. It's a great place for special occasions.  I'm a traveling food snob. How would u know what is and isn't tasty if you haven't experienced different foods at different places?  Travel as much as you can. Ignorance is erased when you experience other cultures. Eat bugs, monkey brains, and baby duck eggs."}
{"text":"I had taken my wife on a special occasion on a recommendation of a co-worker. I have to say that it was a great recommendation. We just loved the unique experience, the large variety, and the high quality of the food. And I think it's well worth the price if you bring your appetite."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I celebrated his 25th birthday there. Let's just say it was an all around INCREDIBLE experience! I made reservations online about a month in advance - requested a \"Happy Birthday\" dessert and a secluded table. They went above and beyond for my requests & the food was absolutely delicious. Bravo! We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places but you must bring a serious appetite. If you are not a meat eater, this place is not for you. Service is swift, meat is great and the atmosphere is great.  Would like better (hot) side dish choices. The rice doesn't work for me. Date nights here would be a huge hit. Living social often had great deals for this place. Take advantage!"}
{"text":"*POSTED ACCIDENTALLY ON MY ACCOUNT BY MY WIFE*  So it's meat. And for the most part it was tasty. However, I fail to see the novelty in paying 100 dollars to eat mass produced meat.   Add in the fact that it took forever to get service sometimes, the salad bar was far from impressive, and this becomes just another disappointing dining experience.   My husband and I were seated at the worst possible table. In a small dark corner where we could barely see each other never mind what was on our plates. Our server was absent at best. The meat men did their jobs when they had anything left but it was obvious our section was just an after thought.   The wine was fine but all they had to do was cork the bottle. My husband's mojito was meh.  Really I fail to see why this is such a hot place. It's a lot of meat. Nothing more. I'm glad we had the groupon otherwise this place was so not worth the drive to 9th.  Don't miss: getting the groupon otherwise the price is just ridiculous. Hit or miss: The meat. The chicken, turkey, seafood on the buffet was all pretty tasteless. The lamb was overcooked. The filet was perfect but I like near raw meat.  Avoid like the plague: The salad bar and the \"side dishes\" aka watery salsa, fake french fries and over cooked rice."}
{"text":"Here's what's good about Brasa: the meat is not awful. The price is a little high, but it won't break the bank. Attractive dudes cut meat off of a sword and put it on your plate. There's a Chihuly chandelier in the dining room (actually pretty darn impressive). The service staff is sufficiently friendly.  What's bad about Brasa? Well, most other things. It's poorly lit and overly spacious. The salad/cold bar is pretty much the saddest little thing I've ever seen referred to as \"fine dining.\" I guess the shrimp were cooked decently but the veggies didn't taste fresh, and almost everything was bland--IMPRESSIVELY bland. No, seriously, you have to TRY to make stuff taste this much like sawdust.  Speaking of sawdust, I'm pretty sure the little dish of \"spices\" they give you to dose your meat with is literally a bowl of bread crumbs.  Anyway, I expected a Brazilian steakhouse to not overcook every single cut they had to offer, and I ended up being pretty happy with-- and having a second or third round of-- a few of them. It's hard to go wrong with filet mignon rapped in bacon.  What I craved and did not receive while at Brasa was some other flavor than meat with my meat. I'm pretty sure half of the meat was completely unseasoned. This was a big disappointment; when your restaurant is based around serving different cuts of meat in a constant flow to your customers, I think you should inject a little bit of variability into that stream.  What keeps Brasa from 2-star-land is the fact that I really did enjoy a few of the many cuts they sent around our table. They were really, honestly good, and at another restaurant, just one slab o' beef will cost as much as your whole dinner at Brasa. You CAN eat good food at this place; there's just a whole lot of dodging the bad stuff to get to it.   I'm not yearning to go back, and I'm not going to be recommending it to friends anytime soon."}
{"text":"$40 for all you can eat steak, how can you go wrong? All of the beef cuts are great but I would stay away from the pork, it was super dry. The chicken and lamb were ok. The service was really good."}
{"text":"Kinda pricey.  In retrospect keep 10 bucks or so in your pocket and just get the salad bar.  It also has some fish and beef hot dishes as well as a number of extraordinary offerings definitely not the typical salad bar and one could definitely fill up without the meat parade.  The basic premise of any brazilian brasa is an endless parade of various meats on a spit deliverd to your table by an endless parade of spitmeisters offering any table with their traffic card with the green side up a bevy of largely overcooked dry meats on a spit.    If you recall the turkey dinner scene from National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, you have some sense of the experience.  The sad thing was the one cut of meat that wasn't chewy was beef tenderloin.  Unfortunately the single potential saving grace from the chewy parade of it's predecessors had been apparetly shot at repeatedly with a large caliber shotgun loaded with a BOATLOAD of parmesan cheese.    Hey Mr. Brasa shoot the cheap cuts with parmesan and let us enjoy the tenderloin without the distraction tenderloin doesn't need distraction the other chewy stuff you plunk down on our plates definitely needs help!!   The food is brought at that point by the spitmeisters, but I was the guy refilling our water glasses and this is supposedly a fairly classy place.  Whaddup?? Where's our waiter??  My god you NEED water to wash this dry stuff down!! Our waiter who was reasonably attentive early on disappeared.for extended stints several times during the course of the meal.    And I don't mean that figuratively he actually DISAPPEARED after reappearing finally and clearing our table when we surrendered our silverware, but never presented a check.  After waiting at least 20 minutes, I went to the host and inquired after his whereabouts and  there was much discussion amongst what must have been the owner, the host and several waiters about his whereabouts and a flurry of confusion.  Another 10 minutes or so passed and eventually the host came by with complimentary shots of some very sweet anise flavored cordial, (definitely not Ouzo), and presented our check.  It was just over $200 bucks for four, and I have to admit coughing up twenty bucks for our share of the tip was tough to do in light of the waiter being in absentia and all, but I bit the bullet and ponyed up.    Apparently our waiter is the guy that shoots the tenderloin with parmesan plugs and couldn't be pulled away for the grand finale of check presentment.  Odd, it was early evening on a Saturday not too long after they opened so it wasn't shift change time or anything.  Oh well.  Get the salad bar skip the meat."}
{"text":"We had dinner once again at Brasa, after several years of abandonment.  We attended to celebrate my cousin's 26th birthday and we really had a lot of fun.  The food was good, the laughs were great, and the evening was just awesome.    I tasted a few things from the salad bar, including salmon, anchovies, crackers, and goat cheese.  This was the first buffet I've seen that offers goat cheese!  After about 15 minutes of waiting for the meat to arrive, the meat arrived.  I guess they want you to fill up on the buffet first.  When the meat arrived, the chicken and sausage, you know, the cheap stuff, arrived first.  No worries, the chicken looked appetizing, so I requested a leg.  And to my surprise, it was delicious.  Others at the table commented that the chicken legs were just, \"Okay\".    Last, but no least, filet mignon was offered and by the time the waiter made it to my end of the table seating 20, it was gone!  Alas, I'll wait, I thought.  Another 10 minutes later, more filet mignon arrived, and I asked for a double serving, which was probably 6 oz in all.  It was tasty, but the Parmesan Cheese encrusting the filet was very salty.  The top sirloin was pretty good too.    Honestly, the quality of the meat is slightly above average, but again, nothing to write home about.  Finally, the waiters stopped visiting our table, despite our passive aggressive green cards lying face up.  After a 10 minute delay, a few more waiters arrived with additional meat for us.  Once I had my fill, and I was probably the last to get his fill, most likely because I was at the end of the 20-person train, I turned my green card over to bear its red face.    The dim, but beautiful light above the buffet has been replaced with bright, LED track lights.  Good job!  I had two glasses of Cabernet wine and it was very tasty.  They never brought the bottle, so I have on idea what I was drinking.  With tip, my wife and I paid $140 for the meal.  I think it was a bit pricey for the quality of meats received, but we had such a good time with the friends and family that I didn't care.  It was fun and our server was funny and terrific."}
{"text":"Thursday Evening Happy Hour is a Great time to visit. A Brazilian Band played in the outside seating area. We ordered the Sangria as our beverage of choice. Very colorful and just felt like summer. Ordered the 4 meat sampler plate such was delicious. Lamb, Filet Mignon wrapped in bacon, Sirloin, and Chicken Parm Breast at a very reasonable price is the way to go."}
{"text":"Unlimited Skewered Meat & Salad Bar...how can you go wrong???"}
{"text":"I had never been to a Brazilian style steakhouse before, so this was a new experience for me. For my husband's 50th birthday, I decided to treat him to this place, as he had been wanting to go there for awhile. We went on a Tuesday evening, and there were 7 other tables seated with people when we came in. The waiter was efficient in telling us how everything worked, and in bringing our drinks and the interesting little bread bites. I definitely agree with many of the other reviewers that the lighting is inadequate. They should install more light fixtures.   We decided to check out the salad bar. The items we had on there were very tasty and fresh, although neither one of us had more than a few bites of anything because we really came for the main attraction, MEAT. After being pleased by the small but tasty salad bar offerings, we started on the meat. I tried most of what they offered, but got full before I could try the ribs (which my hubby raved about). The only meat which was really dry was the pork chops, and they were really quite inedible due to the dryness. The ham was tasty, but very salty, stay away if you have high blood pressure! Other than that, I don't see what many f the other reviewers were saying. Everything else was delicious and moist. The lamb was slightly dry, but it is such a lean meat that is rather unavoidable unless it is rare. It was a bit gamy for me, but I'm mostly a beef and chicken girl myself. The parmesan filet was melt-in-your-mouth, and literally didn't need a knife to cut it. The strip steak was divine. Even the chicken legs were seasoned well and tasty.   The only reason I will not be going back, nor giving it 5 stars, is the price. As I said, it was a special occasion, so I wasn't too upset about shelling out $100 for dinner. We normally stick to under $50 for dinner for both of us. But really, $40 for all you can eat meat isn't unreasonable, as in my opinion the meat was wonderful. I'm sure I ate more than I would have at a traditional steakhouse, so I'm not too upset. But with over $6 tax and the tip on top of $40/person, it is just a bit much for us. I cannot see how they only give $10 off for not having the meat. It is backwards, it should only cost $10 for the salad bar only, not $30!   Overall a pleasant experience. If the price were to come down, or I had a really good coupon I would definitely dine here again.   (on a side note, I never even thought about parking, we ended up parking about a block away, at a lot which was only $5. We don't normally dine downtown, so that may have been why it caught me off guard. Just be sure to have a couple extra bucks to park)"}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars I would. If I could leave a negative star rating, I would.   Terrible food, even worse service. Waited for an hour and a half AFTER finishing eating our awful food to pay and leave.   Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. Grossly overpriced as well."}

{"text":"After my first experience with Brasa, I decided to give it another try, and the experience was 5 stars all around. For the last year, it has been one of our favorite places to go out for special occasions (and made-up special occasions when we're just craving meat.)  After our last experience, I think that tradition will end. Our service last night was inexcusable. When I think of Brasa, I think of fine dining. We go to Brasa for date night, and when the bill coming back is in the 100 dollar range, I expect pretty impeccable service. Perhaps years of working in the service industry has given me high expectations, but when you choose to dine at one restaurant over another, you expect the best.  The first down point was that we had a reservation and it took eons to get to our table. Our hostess told us \"oh, we're just cleaning off a table. It will be a few minutes. Go ahead and have a seat in the lounge.\" That gives you the impression that you will be seated shortly. Not at Brasa. It took us 45 minutes to get seated WITH A RESERVATION. And of course, the lounge was so crowded, so there weren't any seats to wait in. So after standing for 45 minutes, the hostess directs us to a table that had been clean and open for a whole 20 minutes. Unbelievable.  Our table's location was less than ideal. We were right on the edge of the dining room by the lounge. It was loud, crowded, and I could hardly hear my fiancee speak. But, hell, we were seated finally, so who can complain about the location? Our waiter promptly greeted us, which was a very redeeming quality. After making a nice trip to the salad bar, it was time for the best part..the meat.  25 minutes later, the first piece arrived. Our card had been green for 25 minutes before they graciously served us some sausage and chicken. Many waiters walked by, just no meat. I was hungry; I was anxious; I was starting to become one of those people  that just stare around the dinning room impatiently...desperately hoping the food will arrive soon. So, I ate that rather hurriedly...And another 15 minutes went by before another piece of meat arrived...and guess what it was? Sausage again. The sausage train continued for a little longer...Wait 15 minutes...more sausage. Wait a tad longer...more sausage. So we sat there. Without any rice or plantains to sooth our hunger either, since they'd seemed to had conveniently forgotten those as well.  It wasn't until a good while later that some other cuts started arriving. We sampled about 4 different kinds of meat at this point, 45 minutes into our meat service. But, where was the good stuff? Where was the filet? Where was the sirloin? Where was the pork? It seemed the waiters were bringing out sausage, beef rib, lamb, and chicken legs only.  It wasn't until new people arrived at the nearby tables that the waiters finally started bringing out different cuts (about an hour after seating). I think if it hadn't been for those people, we wouldn't have gotten to sample much at all. Every other time I'd been to Brasa, it was a constantly rotating selection of meat. You might have to wait a few minutes between pieces, but you were never nervously nibbling on bread, fearing all they'd bring after 20 minutes would be more sausage.  Being a waitress for years myself, I am usually pretty lenient on bad service. Brasa was indeed busy that night, but it had always been busy before. The service we received was one of the worst experiences I ever had at a restaurant, especially a place that is supposed to be higher-end dining. Part of me thinks it's partly because my fiancee and I were indeed the youngest people in the restaurant. Why bother going out of your way to take care of two kids who probably won't tip much anyway, right? (How wrong!) Several waiters walked by and noticed our plates were empty and our anxious stares, but no one seemed to care about making sure our service was superb. Even being sat in a corner, you expect to get the same service as someone who is sitting in the middle of the dining room. I can almost guarantee that people sitting closer to the center received much better service and selection than we did.   I am giving this review one star (it almost deserves none) simply because of a guy (who I assumed was the manager) who seemed to try and make our experience a tad better. After he walked by a few times, miraculously, our side dishes came and our waters were filled. At least management tried and ensure that the waiters were attempting to do their job.  What a shame, Brasa. What a shame."}
{"text":"I walked into the restaurant a little hesitant, knowing that the bill would be a flat rate of $40 per person. However, my doubts were quickly turned into joy. The service was excellent and friendly; the salad bar was absolutely amazing with dozens of things to choose from; and the atmosphere was also great. Yet, the best portion of dinner was the fresh cuts of meat served to you at the end, I would HIGHLY recommend the lamb, as it was absolutely delicious. Also, the steak was excellent. Really, the only reason they did not get five stars was a factor out of their control, the construction and the parking in the area made it very difficult to navigate on W. 9th and find a place to park. Great experience and absolutely worth every penny of the forty dollars."}
{"text":"Two words, \"Meat Coma\"  I liked the buffet with a variety of dishes, not all I'm sure are truly Brazilian in origin but are delicious none the less.  The rest of the evening is spent with severs offering various skewered meats delivered table side until you cry uncle by turning your serving green/red card to red.  The deserts were ok, however they do offer the perfect topper to a meal of meat, flaming coffee!"}
{"text":"Great Brazilian BBQ place! My family went here to celebrate my parents anniversary. The food is delicious and not something you normally find. It runs pretty expensive for a meal though. Maybe  $200 for four people."}
{"text":"Quantity not quality.   Salad and seafood buffet.  $30.00  The salad bar was fine, but I've seen salad bars with more toppings. The seafood in general was fine, but the fish (I forgot what kind it was) in lime sauce was a bit dried out. I'd say my favourite was the shrimp cocktail, pretty hard to screw up. There were also a few pre-made salads, including a broccoli salad which was good. Not really worth $30 in and of itself in my opinion; it would be if the seafood was amazing, but it wasn't.   Meat $10.00 add on.  There were lots of cuts of meat, but they were not very high quality. There was a lot of fat on the meat, some of the meat was dried out, all of the meat (except the pork tenderloin and turkey) was rare. Every piece of meat I received expect the filet mignon required an operation of one sort or another before I could eat it. By the end of the meal I gave the waiter two side plates full of scraps and my dinner partner handed over one himself. The way this works is various waiters walk around the place with skewers of meat slicing it onto your plates.   For $40, probably fewer, I would just go somewhere else and order myself a filet and shrimp cocktail."}
{"text":"Went there for a friend's birthday and was fairly impressed however it was expensive. Two people , two dinners and some drinks with a shared dessert and it was $150.00."}
{"text":"Date type place. Very friendly servers and nice ambience however the meet variety is very limited and oily. It was hard to appreciate good meat. I tried 12 out of the 13 options and most of the steak were very similar in taste. They should have more filet mignon and kabobs and chicken options for variety so more people are attracted to coming here. The Dominican Arabian girl Jerisima (I'm pretty sure I misspelled it) was very sweet and came to check up on us frequently. Additionally she was such a sweetheart when we asked her to take pictures for us. She offered some cute pose ideas and the pictures came out wonderful. But honestly... The place needs more meat options"}
