{"text":"This is usually my second choice to Vua when I'm too hungry to walk to St Denis from the Village. It's definitely not the best banh mi in the city but at the end of the day it's comforting and filling enough for the price. I will add that service is top notch and the place was clean every time I've been in!"}
{"text":"Very good Vermicelli at a reasonable price. I found the chicken well cooked and the quality is not fast food."}
{"text":"So I was walking on Ste-Catherine after parking my car on my way to work and I was in need for a bite. Walked by this place, looked interesting. I go in, saw the 11.45$ special with a Banh-Mi sandwich, a soup and a beverage. Found that this was a bit overpriced, considered a Banh-Mi place, but I thought to myself, maybe the taste will be amazing.... Unfortunately, it was not, the soup had no taste whatsoever and the sandwich was a bit dry (I took the Special). I could only choose, Coke, Diet Coke, Ginger Ale or water which I took or else it was extra. A lot of better Banh-Mi places - sorry, but the vermicelli plates that other customers had, looked good, maybe I will give this place an other chance. I might try something on the menu, that's not the name of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this popular place.  And it's popular for a reason: the banh mi are delish.  I always get the vegetarian but my meat eater friends say the non-veg options are also wonderful.  It's the best thing that's happened in the village since PrEP!"}
{"text":"Good Banh Mi place,  Maybe a bit too much sauce tho And when you ask for it to be spicy  The spicyness is kinda patchy Bubble tea is really watered down, dont recommend it Nice place and location"}
{"text":"J'ai commandé un sandwich...ouff! En premier lieu je regarde la viande vite fait je me dit je vais prendre le sandwich au buf mais il avait l,air gras alors je me suis dit que je vais prendre au porc je suis pas trop fan mais bon tout le reste des viandes avait l'air...bon alors je n'est pas vu la dame mettre la viande dans mon sandwich j'étais préoccupé par autre chose. En arrivant chez moi je croque une première bouché et je constate que je suis en train de manger du gras de porc pure a 100%  J'ouvre le sandwich,que du gras de porc 20% de viande même pas...lol Une chance que j'avais dit a la dame que je ne voulais pas quelque chose de gras. J'ai retourné le sandwich et il m'ont remboursé mais quand même vendre du gras?..Depuis j'ai appris a faire des banh mi maison c'est vraiment pas compliqué on peu trouver facilement du meilleur pain et de la mailleur viande et le daikon et carottes un coup mariné se garde un bon 2 semaines et coute presque rien. Moi je fais pousser ma coriandre c'est encore mieux et  j'utilise du pâté de foie aux fines herbes (pour le fer et le gout) avec sauce hoisin et un peu de siratcha. salade, tofu grillé au curry et bingo!"}
{"text":"I love the Banh Mi here and the nice location in the village often means there's handsome men with beards also eating here. The only drawback is the soup which isn't so nice and is often messy, and not quite the impression you want to make on the handsome bearded men. It's also made with hot water poured over cold ingredients which isn't the best (although I get that it befits the kind of kitchen they have). But oh those sandwiches. 5 stars for the sandwich and 2 stars for the ersatz soup."}
{"text":"I was on my vacation and went to Montreal. I found this place as I walked around town with my friends and decided to stop by. It was the best meal that we had in Montreal. Their Banh Mi is authentic and it was better than any Banh Mi restaurants here in my hometown, LA.  My friends and I chose different kinds of Banh Mi that they offered us. I got the Roast Pork or Porc Rôti, the meat was chewy and a little bit juicy. Along with their special sauce, I felt like the food melted in my mouth as I chewed. It gave a nice flavor along with all the condiments, such as pepper, cucumber, and cilantro. The pate and mayo were fanstatic, they tasted sooooooo yummyyyy!  My friends chose the Special, BBQ pork, And Grilled Chicken and all of them said it was very yummy and tasty. Their bubble teas were awesome too  Also, the restaurant was very clean and neat and it made me feel warm and cozy the moment I stepped in. Inside the restaurant were pictures about Banh Mi, and Letters on the wall behind the counter were bomb!  The service was incredible, the owners were both friendly and we felt very comfortable there. We decided to come back before we went back to LA though and I'm craving the Roast Pork banh mi now  Anyway, I can't even complaint anything about this place!"}
{"text":"The best salmon poke bowl I've ever had!! Huge size, lots of salmon, and so much flavour. Highly recommend, delicious."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Vietnamese sandwiches, this place is ok. I have been many times. I think they are slowly improving their menu and the quality of food. The service is great!"}
{"text":"So I tried this place for lunch and got the combo with a drink, soup and a small eggroll.  I actually liked the eggroll and soup more than the sandwich!  mainly because of the taste of the pork, but also because there was more meat in the eggroll and the won tons than the sandwich.    As for the banh mi, or the sandwich itself, the bread was excellent and as I would have expected. Awesome, flaky crust with just the right amount of chewiness.  The vegetables were as fresh as could be expected and the pickled items also on point.  While the amount of protein in the sandwich might be a traditional Vietnamese ratio, I think Western palates might be disappointed.    In all fairness, I have been to Banh Mi Boys in Toronto and have found that to be the good standard for banh mi in North America, so I am a bit spoiled with a large amount of protein in my banh mi.  The lady working behind the counter was nice and I appreciated her suggestions on what to try and she earned her shop a star.  Overall, I'd give this place two stars for the food and an additional star for the kind staff.  Nice place that fills a need but nothing I'd go out of my way for.  Suggestion for all banh mi restaurants: instead of just a 7\" or 10\" sandwich option, how about an \"extra meat\" option.  I would have gladly paid the combo price for a sandwich with double meat and a drink without the fried egg roll and soup."}
{"text":"I LOVE vietnamese banh mi! When i first saw this place, i was really intrigued about it and had to give it a try. So my husband was the first to bring some home on his way back from work. It was their grand opening. We tried the classic meat banh mi and the grilled chicken. We weren't impressed but said \"hey! It's their first day. Let's give them a break!\"  Then second time around wasn't better. I got the nem nuong, the classic, the grilled chicken and the beef banh mi. Not really authentic. The mayo wasn't the homemade egg yolk mayo. It's more like an emulsion of vegetable of oil and a bit of salt. The pâté tasted really strong, pungent and bitter. The meats were too sweet and the pickled vegetables weren't crunchy. The bread was ok and it is fun to have the choice between the 7'' or the 10\" baguette. I also ordered one imperial roll... -_- The roll is smaller then my thumb! They hand out a fidelity card. After 10 banh mi, you get 1 free. The service is very nice. Too bad that the food isn't that good."}
