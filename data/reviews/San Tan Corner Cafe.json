{"text":"Only 2 reviews?  I wonder if they are new..
We stopped in for breakfast. The acai bowl was amazing.. highly recommended.  Also had the everything breakfast burrito, yum.
Also, not sure I want to expose the secret about the coffee. . You'll have to find out for yourself :)"}
{"text":"The food isn't amazing. The prices are ridiculous (I will never pay $3 for a red bull) but the service is amazing and it's convenient.  I work in the building next door and the owner knows my name. He knows I'm always in a rush and they deliver as needed. My only complaint would be that they close at 3...which is too early. But I treasure my San Tan cafe."}
{"text":"Decent enough for a work cafe when you need a quick lunch/bfast but nothing special."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great deals and home hand made style to it. On top of this the people that run it are b outstanding. Definitely my choice for lunch or a quick snack..."}
{"text":"The chicken crossiant is a processed chicken patty from a frozen pack on a cold crossiant. I went due to reviews. This is strictly a cafe for people working close and need a quick bite. Nothing great. The ice coffee was ok."}
