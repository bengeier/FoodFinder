{"text":"The pricing at this eatery is very clever. They price their meals so that with tax, it will be a whole number. I ordered the famous pork bone soup for dinner. It was $6.19, with tax it was exactly $7. My friend ordered the ramen noodles, it was $7.09, with taxed it came up to be exactly $8. 

It was not too busy when I visited. There didn't 't seem to be a/c but there were two large fans that seemed to do the job at keeping the place at a comfortable temperature. The interior, like the other reviewers mentioned, is not exactly attractive, but if you're just looking for a quick and cheap meal, this is perfect. 

The waiter/server/cashier working here was very friendly. Although he seemed to be the only person serving customers, the service was very quick. The service here is one of the best I've seen at an asian food establishments. He made sure to check up on our table after a while and even offered additional complimentary appetizers. I would give 5 stars for the service. 

This was my first time having pork bone soup so I can't really compare the quality of it to other eateries. I can however comment that the portions are very generous. I wasn't able to finish my meal. 

I will definately be visiting again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Thumbs Up is a good place to enjoy some Korean cuisine if you're not looking for fancy surroundings. It's sparse where the kitchen takes about  1/4 of the restaurant, so overall the place can hold about 20 people.
I ordered the Pork Bone from here and found it to be okay but definitely not the best as people have stated before me (beef was tender but I thought the broth could have been more flavoured). I assume what's good about this place that keeps people coming back for more are the huge portions, low prices and super friendly staff. Dishes are about $5 - $7 each and a side of kimchi and pickled daikons are always refillable.
Yup, A great place for a cheap fixed meal."}
{"text":"It is such a simple place, but the bibimbap they serve has got to be one of the cheapest bibimbaps available in Toronto, but has also got to be one of the most delicious things in Toronto. It is so simple, but I come back, almost every day. I don't know what else a place like this needs to do to get 5 stars, and so I am giving it 5 stars."}
{"text":"As per reviews, I opted for the pork bone soup. I'd never had it before, so this was my cherry pork bone soup... (sounds appetizing, no?)

I was amazed that the pork bone, when trying to handle it with my chopsticks, was comparable to the size of a small child's head. Holy momma! This was quite an experience in-and-of itself. If you have any qualms with feeling like someone ripped a section of pig's vertebrate out and dropped it in your soup for your culinary delight... do not order it. There is little question to where your dinner came from, in contrast to say, McD's chicken nuggets ('From a CHICKEN!? No way!) Any how, the pork bone really enhances the flavour of the broth... delicious!

Very pleased with the food and the service."}
{"text":"I unfortunately have to lower my star rating, as my last experience was disappointing to say the least.

I've had good experiences in the past, with their \"diner\" category of food (tteokbokki, kimchi stirfry, etc), but they should really limit their menu to what they're good at, and eliminate the rest.

Initially, I tried to order their \"chinese\" food, seafood jjamppong, but then they said that it was going to take too long to make. Why have something on the menu that you're not even going to serve?

So I ordered something from the \"restaurant\" category (kimchi stew).

I was really disappointed to see that the kimchi stew came lukewarm in a terra cotta pot that was obviously not hot, as the server brought the pot over without a plastic plate underneath, and he was able to hold the pot directly.

Totally defeats the purpose of having a terra cotta pot, and against all proper Korean cuisine norms."}
{"text":"I ate a quick dinner here after getting my haircut down the street at Goa.

It's a small, super casual place. We were greeted upon entry and quickly brought a pitcher of water, cups and menus. I ordered jajangmyeon (black bean noodles, $6 tax included), a dish first introduced to me during my Korean drama phase. (Both girls and guys in the k-dramas are always slurping up these noodles while they cry or are otherwise down on their luck, so it must be good!) My +1 ordered bibimbap ($7 tax included).

While we waited for our orders, we were brought four little apps (kimchi, sprouts, pickled radish? and a fourth one that I wasn't sure about). The server also brought up fried dumplings, but they were not meant for our table. Oops.

The food came quickly and was decently tasty, but nothing extraordinary. For $13 dinner for two, it was great bang for our buck. Maybe next time I'll try their pork bone soup!

Recommended for a quick, cheap and filling meal!"}
{"text":"I (used to) love this place! My friend and I have been going there every Thursday for dinner for about a year now. The prices are great and the food is delicious. However, we haven't been back in 2 weeks...The last time we were there, we seriously forgot to give a tip (we usually tip well)....the waiter ran out of the restaurant and CHASED US asking/demanding for a tip! Such terrible taste! So needless to say, we haven't been back since...food is good, but remember to tip ha ha!"}
{"text":"Living in the area for the last 4 years has given me ample opportunity to try pork bone soup from different restaurants.  This is my favorite so far.  Generous portions, broth that is both spicy and flavorful, and pork bones with meat falling off with barely a nudge.  And you can't beat the price!

Others crave chicken noodle soup when they're sick.  I crave gamjatang!  

Other tasty items on the menu - mandu (dumplings), mandugok (dumplings in soup), jajamyung (not sure if I spelled that correctly but its noodles w/ black bean sauce)

Two thumbs up for Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The food and price are very good there. Unfortunately they moved."}
{"text":"Apps taste bad, and service is way below average. Main food was ok. They kept going on about written prices that are not updated, so they tell you the updated price after you order the food. The price is very low to start with so I did not mind, but just take some time to update the price when you decide to change it, instead of telling me after I order the food, it is like you are trying to trick me or something."}
{"text":"One of the best pork bone soups in the city. This family owned restaurant has been dishing out affordable, delicious food ever since high school. I've never been disappointed with the service!! Authentic Korean Food.. head to Thumbs Up!"}
{"text":"Good food for a good price! I could not believe what we got for what we paid for! Dumpling soup, seafood pancake, spicy pork bone rice and beef bulgogi with rice, all under $30 including tip. The food was so very flavourful each dish on its own, coming out fresh and piping hot! We couldn't finish it all between the two of us... we even had enough to take home for another meal, no jokes!"}
{"text":"I used to give them 5 stars in the past because I think their cabbage kimchi and porkbone soup are the best in town. I have come here to dine in for over 10 years. This family run restaurant was changed the ownership last three or four years and raised $1.00 - $2.00 more on all dishes in their menu. But it's still within student's budget. -1 point for interior decor."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here again. Ordered the pork bone soup. Service was prompt and the appetizers were good. Kimchi, potatoes, bean sprouts and cabbage. I've had better appetizers elsewhere but these tasted ok.

The pork bone soup was served piping hot with a side of rice. The meat was soft and tender. The broth was spicy and tasty. The veggies and potatoes were good. 

Great price $6.19 plus tax! Would definitely go back. We had so much leftover they gave us containers to take it to go. Great value!"}
{"text":"First time here at this restaurant and true to its name, this place is a Thumbs Up. 

My first impression of this place was medicore.   The place looks like a typical and very casual cafeteria and had only 1 couple dining in. Looks wise, it looks like a place I would avoid but this place was recommended by a friend so why not.   Ordered the bibimbap, pork born soup, and the dumpling and rice cake which totaled to about just over $23. The quantity was very generous for this price and for a small place, the service was excellent. Food came out within 5 min and the food was decent. I m glad I tried this place and would recommend it others."}
{"text":"I love this place. Consistently delicious and very affordable. No much atmosphere though, more of a cafeteria style place. The service is really good, everyone there is attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Thumbs Up many times. Despite the strange name, I have to strongly recommend the Pork Bone soup as the best I have had in Toronto (I have tried about a dozen others)."}

*$6 lunch Special (including tax) from 11:30-2pm

I found out about Thumbs Up Restaurant because they are well known on many restaurant review websites for having a killer lunch deal.
And for 6 dollars? I do have to agree. 

Once in awhile, I go to Christie to visit the Korean market and have lunch around the area. Last 2 times I was there, I went to Buk Chang Dong Tofu Pot place and I wanted to try something new so I dropped by Thumbs Up. I find their menu to be quite random here. They serve all different 'types' of Korean food and it's not really categorized. I was aware of the fact that some people say they have the best pork bone soup here...but I personally don't like that dish so that didn't interest me very much.

When we sat down, we were given some water and a piece of paper with menu printed on it and we could basically write down how many of what we wanted.

We were given 3 types of side dishes and to be honest, they were all pretty bad.
KimChi was very bland and basically covered in red pepper flakes, the potatoes were undercooked and I don't even know what that shredded cabbage was.

Ordered: #7 Dukbocki 2/5

*Korean rice cake with vermicelli and cabbage in spicy sauce for $5.31
*I love spicy rice cakes and everytime I visit Korea, I would have this at least once a day
*It's a childhood food for Koreans but still very much loved by adults 
*I was surprised to see that they used 2 types of rice cakes (the long ones and the flat ones)
*Rice cake was overcooked and way too soft
*They use more chili flakes than chili sauce (gochujang). This could be either way, it's just their recipe
*I could tell that they don't use MSG here at this restaurant
*Usually when I eat this out, it's filled with MSG so it would be super spicy but this one tasted like it was homemade
*Overall it was too bland and watered down

Ordered: #14 Goon Mandoo 1/5

*Plate of 11 pan fried dumplings for $5.31
*At asian restaurants, pan fried dumplings are quite standard and usually a safe item to order
*I usually order these when my main dishes are spicy to balance it out
*Fillings were grounded up pork and some chopped up vermicelli
*Fillings were really mushy, had no flavor and had this unpleasant taste
*These were just bad dumplings overall


Ordered: #17 Ojinguh Bokum 3/5

*Stir fried squid and vegetables in spicy sauce served with rice for $7.08
*Normally I don't really care for this dish but if you've been following my tweets recently, I've been obessed with Spicy squid and Milkshakes!
*This dish is quite big in size (rice and squid)
*This wasn't spicy at all but it had enough sauce to be eaten with rice
*It looked like there wasn't much squid but there was underneath all that cabbage pieces
*I actually enjoyed this dish a lot
*It tasted home made but had overall good spicy flavor

Service was really good at Thumbs Up- there was this girl working by herself and she would constantly check up on us asking if we needed anything. She actually went around asking people how was the food and if they were enjoying it. I think she made my visit extra pleasant by being in such a good spirit!

Summary: For $6 lunch, you can't really complain about Thumbs Up. Their food is just average and if you like home-made style Korean food, this might be the place for you."}
{"text":"This is my other favorite Korean eatery in Toronto, along with Buk Chang Dong Soon (further down Bloor, near Christie). Service is always with a smile and a good variety is on the menu. I recommend the bulgolgi and spicy squid stir fry plattter (#20 on the menu I think)."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in here after we discovered Seoul kitchen was packed post-thunderstorm.. Naturally anticipating eating the same type of fare that SK offers. I've eaten at this place a couple times in previous years and the price has hiked up while the menu has shrank. The kimchi soup hot pans with selected ingredients like tofu, pork, cabbage or beef are great. My spicy squid dish was adequately sweet and savory with spice levels done right. While I feel it's definitely a go-to for fast, cheap and good food something struck me as odd about tonight's visit:

1. My friend and I were told hot pan for 2+ people weren't available, and after a family of 6 walked in and ordered, they were given a hot pan with spam, instant noodle and vegetables... Hmmmm!
2. My friend got his bimbimbap in not-a-stone bowl. What's the point then? The burned rice at the bottom is totally part of the experience! Oh well it is Korean fast food place

Otherwise the server offered to refill our water (from a hot/cold water dispenser) often and was super polite. I feel bad for writing a snarky review but having known there were much better experiences... It's kind of a shame."}
{"text":"Great values! I had pork bone soup, served with side dishes and rice $7. I couldn't finish it there, even tho I normally eat a lot!~ I packed the left over home and cooked with Vegetable for two more meals. Yummy!

Food was good, especially relevant to its price! Service is friendly. 

Yet, Korean food are good, but it was just too much meat and fat. The frozen soup was like a frozen butter cake. I guess eat it one in a while should be fine, but not too often."}
{"text":"I'm not going to review the pork bone soup. I tried it once and realized that I hate pork bone soup.

I go here for the fried dumplings which cost about 5 or 6 dollars. The bibimbap is also great here.

The best thing at Thumbs Up is their kimchi side dishes which are included with your meal. They make this cold potato salad thing that is very addictive."}
{"text":"I love this place! There is something about this place that makes me feel really comfortable and cozy. It is a small family owned eatery but the food here is really good. Plus it is one of the cheapest in Koreatown. 
I like the labokki here. The portion is pretty big too!"}
{"text":"holy cow. or should i say holy pork bone!

people on this site weren't kidding when it came to good pork bone soup.  first off, i really dig the fact that the kitchen is \"open concept\" at this really small eatery, and you can see that the chefs are little korean ladies.

to chime in on other folks' reviews of thumbs up (although i fear that it will start getting crowded with all these 4 and 5 star reviews) 

- mad cheap.everything on the menu at most 7 bucks. and they have a $5 (taxes in) lunch deal.... i just wish i worked in the area....
- service is great. the dude working our table was very courteous and polite. it made me laugh every time he said thank you when he did things for us.
- food was really really good. we were 4 people, and had ordered 5 dishes (eyes were definitely bigger than our appetites).

i am definitely coming back...."}
{"text":"Came here during the summer. Decided to randomly pop in for a quick snack and was greatly surprised! I ended up finding a hidden gem! Only had an order of deep fried dumplings and they still served us ban Chan (side dishes) which were amazing! Great and friendly little place"}
{"text":"I like their appitizers and the very casual homely style of the place. The food is very food and I have been going here for 7 years now"}
{"text":"Came here a few nights ago with my Roommate, The memories are a bit hazy but the food seemed pretty good. I had the Kimchi Bokum Bap (aka rice with beef and kimchi) It was very spicy and was 7 bucks. All in all seemed like a good deal."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend and a huge craving for pork bone soup. 

The PBS is a little more sour than most, he said it was because of the kimchee content in it. Not bad overall, but still left me wanting. 

Otherwise, I was very happy with the quality of the service and price, I'd like to come back and try some other their other dishes."}
{"text":"Couldnt order. Called the restaurant, who gave me a number for their delivery company. When I called them, they told me I couldnt order through them, I had to go to a website. 

Maybe I'll try it in person if Im in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent prices & kamjatang (pork bone soup). Came here entirely on a whim (I checked out the menu outside and my friend and I shrugged and went, 'why not?' as we walked in. I mean, it is Koreatown... The food has got to be authentic!) as I was super hungry and it was one of the first places we saw. The server was very friendly and helpful. I ordered the kamjatang as that's my go-to dish at any Korean restaurant if trying the place for the first time (helps me guage how good and authentic it is) - and it was very delicious and spicy. The broth was flavourful and had lots of cabbage and meaty pork bone and potatoes to fill you substantially. A Korean family and Korean people were there as well so you know it's approved :) I hear it is a family owned business, which is my favourite type of restaurants. It even has a homey family \"kitchen\" restaurant feel, not very impressive aesthetically but very clean interior space.

Thumbs up to Thumbs Up!"}
{"text":"It was on a whim. I knew I wanted Korean food, a place where the mother, father, son/daughter came to serve me my dinner. I wanted a small mom & pop joint boasting comfort food on its menu. I found it here, conveniently, at thumbs up.

Like most Korean restaurants in Korea town, thumbs up was a small space with wooden tables and had Korean patrons already tucked in enjoying their meal. What I didn't expect were the prices. They were incredible! 5-7 dollars a dish ranging from stews, bibimbop, other rice dishes and noodles. All the favorites were available- including mandu (Korean dumplings). What I wanted, but didn't try, were the hot pot dishes. $14 for a giant table top pot of stew. I instead opted for the single serving, my favorite dish, gamjatang (pork bone soup). My buddy ordered the bulgogi with dumplings to share. Overall, the food was great. Certainly hit the spot. Nothing fancy, but everything you'd want from this type and style of cuisine. The soup was a bit more peppery than I liked, however I still ate it all. 

Thumbs up was great food at a great value. I've eaten better and would recommend other places for gamjatang, but the prices were justified and the service was top-notch. Tea and water refills came non-stop. I had a great time and I will definitely come here again soon.

P.s lunch menu is 5 dollars a dish. Outrageous!"}
{"text":"We went here on the weekend to try their pork bone soup- amaaaazing! It was a revelation and we will be back for more. We also had the ramyon and rice cake- delicious! As others have said the service here is far far better than that at Ka Chi. At Thumbs up we were served by very smiley lovely ladies who actually seem happy that we were frequenting their restaurant. Ka Chi, when we went, made us sit at a table we didn't really want to sit at as there were only 3 of us...or something like that...Anyways, Thumbs Up is a definite new favorite! Go there. Eat Soup!"}
{"text":"This place gets a thumbs up from me! 

This is a small, family run restaurant with a few tables. My friend and I were greeted nicely when we came in, we were given menus and our tea was brought to us very quickly. I opted for the pork bone soup, my friend had a dumpling and egg soup and we shared the bulgogi squid and beef dish. 

Before our meal we were given 4 banchans (kimchi, coleslaw, a potato dish, and some other pickled dish), the kimchi was good, but none of the others really stood out. Our mains arrived shortly, the portions were quite generous. My pork bone soup was good but not the best I have ever had. The portion was ok, the meat was very tender but I wish it would have been a little spicier. My friend's dumpling soup dish was ok, the broth had a nice chicken flavour, was not too salty, and the dumplings were quite hearty; this is definitely a good option on a cold winters day. 

My favourite dish was the bulgogi. This consisted of squid and beef in a sweet and spicy red sauce served with sticky white rice.  The beef was quite tender however the squid was a little chewy but still had good flavour. The sauce had a nice kick to it with just enough sweetness to balance it out. I would highly recommend this dish. 

At the end of our meal my friend and I were absolutely stuffed to the brim, we could barely walk. Our total bill came up to $22 (each dish was $6-$7) which was an amazing bargain for the amount of food we had. The service was quite friendly, our waiter kept checking up on us making sure we liked the food and asking if we needed more banchan. The décor is no frills and is typical of a family run restaurant of this kind. Overall, if I am in the area I will definitely come back for a meal at this restaurant, especially for one of their soups on a cold winter day."}
{"text":"I really won't go into much depth about what i ate at Thumbs Up Korean Restaurant.  The food is similar to the menu across at Kai-Chi Korean Restaurant and other Korean restaurants along Bloor.  
In fact, i must commend the ladies who consistently prepare these Korean dishes to their loyal customers who come and fill their restaurant each and every night.

Thumbs up Korean Restaurant prepares authentic recipes, good food, home cooked style.  Plenty of selection at a really good price (usually in the price range of $6-$9.)  (Makes me guilty when i eat fast food when i could have a real meal at Koreatown.)

Thumbs Up doesn't invest anything in the decor... it resembles somewhat of a soup kitchen, but that is easy to overlook once you start eating.  The food is served hot,  and I strong suggest having nice meal at Thumbs Up during a cold winter day.  That is if you can get a seat."}
{"text":"I've been going to this family owned restaurant since high school. Other than a slight increase in price over the years this place is still the best Korean food for under 10 dollars. 

My personal favourite is the yummy plate that is unique only to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Best place to get pork bone soup in Toronto, as my friend said!!! And she had tried over 20 Korean restaurants in Toronto for their pork bone soup!

No fancy decoration, very tiny, great for fast lunch/dinner or family. But the staff are very friendly, and their food is so great! Feel satisfied after I had a bowl of a little bit spicy soup in the winter season. And it only cost less than $10 including tips!!! 

Thumbs-Up is really thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Thumbs up is really not much to look at. If you are looking for somewhere just slightly more appealing head over to Tofu Village (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/tofu-village-house-of-soon-tofu-toronto), but the ambiance is really not what pulls one to Koreatown anyway. 

Thumbs Up has awesome service. The guy that was waiting the day I ventured in was overly friendly and extremely attentive. I ordered a totally custom creation with tofu, veggies and lots of spice. He was really nice in going back and forth, letting me know what could work and what couldn't. Considering that everything is so cheap, he really went above and beyond what I expect. 

The banchan were pretty decent as well, so I'd be back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"thumbs up recently changed ownership
the friendly older korean ladies have been replaced
fortunately the menu is the same
complete with very reasonable prices
nothing super special
and honestly this is fast food korean 
but it's no frills and satisfying
usually choose this over ka chi across the street"}
{"text":"Not my place of choice.  The restaurant is called \"um ji boon shik\" in Korean,  the word \"um ji\" implies \"finest\" or \"best\". The word Boon Shik refering to quick to make,snack - like foods, most closely resembling fast food in western society. It's my favourite kind of food - all time favourite being ddukbokki - the spice rice cakes.

This is by far one of the worse ones I've been to, only because they skip out on the garnish that makes the food - which the Seoul Boon Shik next door does not. 

I've been here several times - it was the first restaurant I've been to. I find the flavours rather bland and improperly seasoned - yet the price is same as another boon-shik or a regular restaurant. The name of the place is an irony.

The pork bone soup here even, isn't that great. Go to Minerva's Owl for pork bone soup - that's what THEY are known for - and they opened new locations because of how popular their pork bone soup is.

It's more like Thumbs down, if you ask me."}
{"text":"Came by with a friend after she was done work. She ordered the gamjatang and fried mandoo while I ordered bibimbap. Never got around to asking her how her food was but I do have some complaints for mine. My first concern was the rice, it was very oily...usually bibimbap has just plain rice because all the other ingredients will season it but honestly, the fact that rice was already drenched in sesame oil? made me almost not eat. Either way, after dousing my bibimbap with the gochujang, I mixed it up and ate and then 2nd concern came up, there was little to no bulgogi with my meal. Pretty cheap of them to do that. At least, give the customer they're worth. Either way, I'm willing to give this place another chance."}
{"text":"I don't know why this restaurant has such a high rating. 

I wasn't very impressed by the banchan, food, quality, etc.  The banchan was really bleh.  Kimchi wasn't good either.  I usually rate how good a Korean restaurant is based on their banchans.  I was quite disappointed.

I had myself the champong and I felt like it could have been A LOT better.  Was it worth the cheap pricing?  Nah.  I felt like I could've went somewhere else and had better Korean food for the same pricing.  

I should've just went to Ka Chi across the street."}
{"text":"It's a smaller restaurant, which means the service is excellent as they take time to cater to each person and to ensure that our needs are being met. The food is delicious and inexpensive. The pork bone soup was about $6 and one of the best in Korea town!"}
{"text":"Thumbs up has great service, price and food, the three most important aspects I am interested in. The food is tasty and the sides they bring you are top-notch. I like the ramen, seafood pancake, and some of the other dishes. I have been here quite a few times and would definitely go back. Not a date place or a place with fancy decor, but your belly will be satisfied!

thumbs up!"}
{"text":"One thumbs up! Decent Korean restaurant in the heart of Koreatown. 

The $6 lunch special drew me and my friend into the restaurant. This price includes taxes. We got seated and got served barley tea. Yum. The place is small with about 8 tables. We ordered the pork bone soup and the spicy rice cake dishes. 

Soup wasn't spicy at all and was more of a brown color than red. The portion was big but the taste was different from other places I've tried.  Rice cake was good but does not come with an egg here. 

They served us 3 side dishes, kimchi, bean sprouts and cubed soy potatoes.  Everything tasted homemade which was nice but I wouldn't say the food here is particularly delicious. It's just filling so I'd recommend this restaurant for someone who wants a cheap filling hot meal, but not for someone who is looking for a delicious Korean meal."}
{"text":"Oh yes yes yes yes yes yes dear God yes. $9 for a massive plate for pork with kimchi, 4 banchan sides (all delicious), perfect rice, more food than I could hope to swallow. For NINE EFFING DOLLARS. THIS is why I visit Toronto. Zero atmosphere, fast cheap freaking delicious Korean, value we can only dream about in Calgary. An absolute treasure."}
{"text":"This place used to be my go-to for pork bone soup. Like all Korean restaurants, they give you four dishes of appetizers which includes the usual potato, seaweed dishes. 

Service is quite fast and polite but for some reason, they have started adding those very thick peppers to their pork bone soup, making it taste more like pepper than anything else. 

They do however still have lunch specials which is usually $6-7 but with so many other options in the area, especially kachi which has reopened at a larger and nicer location just one block away, this place better step up their game too."}
{"text":"I just realized how often I come here! (once or twice a week!) Thumbs Up is therefore being upgraded to 5 stars, I obviously keep coming back for good reasons!!

-great service, the ladies and guy that work here really are just so lovely, they all make me smile!
-SO cheap (pretty much everything on the menu is either $6 or $7 including tax. And $5 for lunch. Hell yeah!)
-not crowded
-delicious food (pork bone and kimchi stew are my favs)

This is hands down (or thumbs up?) my fav cheap eat in the city."}
{"text":"Thumbs Up (obligatory!) 

Tasty food, great service, and good value! 
What more could you ask for from a restaurant named Thumbs Up?

I ended up at here after having been made to wait far too long for my meal at Central across the corner. That being said, it was easier to notice we were served tea literally as soon as we sat down and that our food arrived within ten minutes of the order.
The waitress realized we didn't have much experience and tried to make helpful suggestions! 
The bibimbap was tasty although it lacked on the meat, but I guess you can't expect much for under $7! I tried one of the seafood soups with tofu (can't remember which) and all I can comment is these guys know how to soup it up.
The highlight however was the seafood pancake! It's huge, full of sea food, and very tasty! Definitely recommended!

Overall Thumbs Up left  a very good first impression and is probably the best Korean food on the cheap I've had in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much but the food is amazing, the service is very quick and at $29 for 3 dishes between 2 people, I'd say it's good value too!

We had the pork bone soup, chicken with rice and the seafood pancake, which was a lot of food for two, but it tastes so good that you want to keep eating.

Definitely worth checking out.  I expect to return!"}
{"text":"My go to for tteokboki and jajangmyun, but I find the food isn't very consistent. Sometimes the tteokboki or jajangmyun are watery. The pork bone soup is not bad either. The service is pretty good and attentive."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place for a quick, satisfying, tasty and cheap Korean homestyle meal. I was originally was supposed to Ka Chi across the street, but they had a wait and I was starving so I decided to go across the street to this place and it's a good thing I did,
Service was so courteous, fast and friendly.

The place is had no atmosphere and looked more like a early 80's cafeteria or diner, but that doesn't matter because the food and service was good and cheap. 
The kitchen was in the same room as the restaurant and you can hear and see the Korean ladies cook up a storm there.
What I really liked was that the water they serve was filtered and they even used filtered water for their tea too!

All meals came with the typical Korean Banchan small starter dishes which were good. Their Kimchee was great and you could get complementary refills.
I ordered the Bibimbap which was a hearty portion and a great deal at about $6. You have to ask for the Korean hot sauce with it, which is a must.
I left extremely full and satisfied for less than what you can spend at Subway or other mediocre chain restaurants, how awesome is that?!

I am not much a Pork Bone Soup fan, but based on people's reviews and my experience with this restaurant I will definitely be back to give it a try!"}
{"text":"I have no idea about Korean food or really Asian food in general. But the food I had at Thumbs Up was both great in quantity and quality.  What really stood out to me was the genuine friendliness of all the employees whom I had dealings. As I say I have no idea about the food other than a sense but would recommend it."}
{"text":"The restaurant isn't anything to write home about but it's casual and clean but the service here was excellent. The waiter kept refilling our teacups, and  I'm sure he was thinking \"jeez, how much tea can these two women drink?\" But he would keep checking on us and refill our cups and banchan (side dishes) at no charge. The seaweed sidedish was tasty. As someone who enjoys Korean food, i think the 4 star rating of this restaurant (both mine and the overall rating of this place) is accurate. We had two stews (19, and 20) and the seafood pancake. Overall very tasty! My only gripe is that they do not have soontofu on the menu (i didn't see it, they have a soybean stew though) and the tofu in my stew was the soft kind whereas i prefer the silken kind. but that's just a personal preference and not something i can hold against the establishment as others may prefer soft tofu. Incredibly affordable place so perfect for everyone, it's $5.31 plus tax for an entree. They also offer hot pot options for $16 each. Will return."}
{"text":"This place is one of my all time favorite's in Toronto! Super cheap prices, and the food is always good and fresh. They call it Korean \"fast-food\", and I guess that would be accurate, since I have never had to wait for more than 5 minutes for my food there! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place just became my go-to-place in Korean town. It is causal, and the food is typical and authentic Korean family food. I like it here because of good price, good food and good portion. It looks like a takeout place, but it is actually sit-down dinning place. The day I went there is only a few people. The waiter is pretty nice. The kitchen is an open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch here around 1PM on Saturday a few weeks ago. This is a small, homey restaurant with just a few tables, and the ambience leaves much to be desired. But the food was on point! We were both craving gam ja tang (pork bone soup) so we ordered the gam ja tang jeongol to share. It was brought out very quickly, and the hot pot was filled with plenty of pork bone, carrots, potatoes and ramen. The broth was spicy and delicious, and the hot pot kept it nice and...well, hot. The meal also came with rice and banchan which wasn't too memorable, but overall the food was great and the portions were huge! A great deal at ~$20 (excluding tip), and definitely way too much food for two small girls like us...but we didn't want to stop eating! 

Service was good too. There was only one guy working but it wasn't too busy so he was pretty good about helping us refill our water or banchan. Thumbs up for Thumbs Up!"}
