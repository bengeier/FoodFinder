{"text":"Was just in to pick up lunch. Everyone here goes above and beyond what is considered good customer service and their food is excellent. Very generous portions. I'll definitely be a regular customer."}
{"text":"The food and the service were both outstanding.  Fresh ingredients, and so flavorful! I will definitely return."}
{"text":"High quality and really affordable! The spam musubi is some of the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are really excited to have a sushi burrito spot that's decent on this side of town. (Yes, I'm throwing shade at the others nearby.) Not only that, but they chose to mix 2 of our favorite things into one spot. Sushi burritos and Hawaiian BBQ? This place has set the bar.

The customer service was friendly and the inside was clean. We both liked the fact that this establishment chose to go with a closed refrigerator counter top versus the normal open top with a glass barrier sneeze guard. We wanted to ensure we got the full experience, so we ordered from both sides of the menu.

From the Hawaiian BBQ menu we ordered the bbq combination plate with the chicken katsu and the teri beef. This comes with 2 scoops of rice and 1 scoop of mac salad. \"The mac ain't whack!\" My boyfriend I both agree they make a good mac salad unlike some places. (Teri Madness) Sadly, teriyaki sauce nor katsu sauce was provided, but neither of us are really upset about it. Neither meat really needed sauce. The meat was cooked impeccably. Kudos to the chef. I've never had chicken katsu cooked so beautifully. I was impressed. I would go back solely just for this. We used the Yelp offer to receive the free pot stickers and were not disappointed. Free means fried, but it was delicious regardless. The pot sticker sauce has a apple cider vinegar base making it a little sweet, but tatsy. My boyfriend especially enjoyed this part. He tried dipping the chicken katsu in it which gave it a kind of tempura taste and later covered his rice in it. We also got 2 spam musubis. The picture online is deceiving because it makes it appear like they're not using the normal amount of seaweed. Don't worry, they do. The spam slice is pretty thick and the rice ratio is normal. Thumbs up on this too.

From the other side of the menu, I got the ahi poke bowl and my boyfriend did a build your own burrito with seaweed, white sushi rice, shrimp tempura, yellowtail, imitation crab, yum yum sauce, unagi sauce, light spicy mayo, salsa, green onions, cilantro, and avocado. My poke bowl was super yummy. My only complaint was the crispy chips because it made it difficult to enjoy all parts of my bowl. I will probably avoid this part in the future. My boyfriend enjoyed his burrito, however, the darker colored yellowtail was a bit chewy. So not a favorite if you're a texture eater.

Overall, our tummies are happy and will definitely be coming back espeically being 5 min away. We're giving them 5 stars because they deserve it. Being open for only 3 weeks, I hope they stick to the standard and quality of cooking that they do now and for years to come."}
{"text":"Jackie did such an amazing job!! Thank you so much for taking care of me !!! Don't forget to mention Yelp! My sushi burrito was so delicious thank you so much for all the great suggestions.The whole team was so kind and efficient"}
{"text":"Came here a few times now and was impressed every time! I love the variety of food they have, also love the fact they keep their veggies for the sushi burrito covered. I've actually never tried a sushi burrito until I came here and i wasn't disappointed. Ingredients tasted fresh and had good portion sizes. The Hawaii food was good here as well, some of the best Mac salad I've had! Great customer service as well, we'll be returning (:"}
{"text":"I love their BYO Bowl it's delicious and the service is excellent. One of my favorite new restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place!!!! I get the pearly burrito, it's amazing! Very fresh and tasty. Love the spicy mayo. The spam musubi is very flavorful and when you add their homemade spicy wasabi sauce mixture to your meal it's just so darn good!! 

This is my first sushi burrito place so I am biased and scared to try another I don't want to be disappointed. I've been here so many times the staff knows me. The place is really clean and inviting inside. It's not a restaurant so not sure why people are complaining about space to sit. Maybe they can add a table or two outside in the future. It is a bit pricey but so worth it. If it was cheaper I would probably eat there everyday, it's so good to me!!! Can't wait to take my mom from Ohio here for her fist sushi burrito."}
{"text":"Spam musubi is great flavor. Great service just all round great food. 

Had the chikidiggy sushi burrito epic!! 

Wasabi mayo wow mind blow. So good. A must have if you like it spicy!! 

Great menu selections if you like Hawaiian food a great place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place after getting boba with my sister. The customer service here is PHENOMENAL. We were greeted with warm smiles upon entering. They even gave us complimentary cloud buns which were extremely delicious. The atmosphere, customer service, and food here is amazing. We'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I will definitely go back again! It's a brand new store, generous amount & variety selections of food. Most importantly, it's freshly made!! Love the customer service and welcoming atmospheres."}
{"text":"The food is well priced it looks delicious however the fish isn't as fresh as I would expect it to be. Bowls are small portions."}
{"text":"I just came here to try their Spam Masubi. I really like mine with furikake in between the rice and spam, their version doesn't have furikake. I asked if they can customize and the I guess they don't do that."}
{"text":"PROS:
+ Menu has both sushi burritos and poke bowls as well as Hawaiian plate lunch meals and bbq. Feeding a family just got easier.
+ Location is convenient, both to my work and for you to pop by next door for dessert at Bover!
+ Free potstickers with Yelp check in and purchase of entree.
+ Service was really friendly and food has been pretty fresh, customization options available.
+ Recommend the Silly Lilly sushi burrito, add avocado.

CONS:
- Prices are a touch higher than they should be, others mention portions seem a little smaller than expected. Order above was $14 with tax/tip. 
-  They go a little heavier on the sauces than I prefer, burrito was a little soggy even after stopping them from adding more sauce.
- Primarily a takeout space with only three small tables, so plan ahead.
- Parking lot gets extremely busy during lunch/dinner, consider the lot to the right of the entrance."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh sushi burrito, super friendly people, what more can you ask for! I already know what I'm ordering on our next visit!"}
{"text":"I checked out Suha a couple of months ago because I was looking for a nearby Hawaiian restaurant. It was the first time I remember going to a Hawaiian restaurant that also served sushi burritos. What can I say? I really enjoy their food. I go there at least once a month. I've had their bbq chicken, beef, short ribs, and a few sushi burritos. The Kaotic burrito in particular is fantastic. It's got an extra kick and the sauce is damn tasty. Their service is great too. Family owned. Hard workers. I really hope they continue to build upon what they've created. 

Quick rant. What is up with people on Yelp who say a lot of great things about a restaurant with no complaints, yet gave the business a 3 star rating??? The hell??? I really don't understand how some of you determine what rating to give. Anyways, give Suha a try. I'm sure you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"The best sushi burrito in town. The Hawaiian BBQ is crazy good. My new fav!!

I'm so glad this place opened. There's nothing like this in this area."}
{"text":"This restaurant in Vegas is in North West area and can satisfy Poke Bowl and Sushi Burrito cravings and more with  Hawaiian BBQ options also. Parking is easily found out front and this is a casual eatery similar to typical Hawaiian BBQ / Poke places etc. 

The service was kind of weird from the cashier who kept calling us to the side of her front register to order, but what the heck I'm still deciding based on the menu which I need to read (their Sushi Burritos and Poke Bowl Menu is on the further right side) because their front menu is just the Hawaiian BBQ menu. I felt rushed from her, which was interesting, weak service as I am still perusing the side menu I had to tell her. 

Also they have no condiments or napkins up front for grabs so you have to ask the workers for those items which is behind them. 

I enjoyed my *Kaotic Sushi Burrito*:
-Protein: shrimp tempura, salmon. Sauce: spicy mayo, unagi sauce. 
-Toppings: avocado, cream cheese, cucumber, onions, mixed greens. Deep fried in tempura batter. 
It all went perfectly together and had amazing taste. The flavors and texture of the veggies in it was very fresh and 4 stars for the food. 

I also tried their *BBQ Beef and Chicken combo plate* which was filling and delicious as well. 

Overall, yummy eats when seeking something different Suha is pretty good. 3.5 Stars.~"}
{"text":"Really good food and super friendly service! First time trying a \"sushi burrito\" and I loved it"}
{"text":"I stopped by for sushi burritos! It was so good and fresh. Small size with tasteful sauces. Highly recommend to try burritos and Teriyaki Bowl."}
{"text":"Their BBQ are good, I love it . Yumyum. 
I love the sushi rolls they are super fire!!!!"}
{"text":"I love their sushi burritos, the protein they use on their burritos are very fresh, and they portion-sizes are decent. The Kaotic sushi burrito is really delicious, it's my favorite and the sauces they use are rich in flavor. I love their customer service, the manager and the workers are very nice, friendly and welcoming. This is my new go-to spot. 10/10 would recommend this to a friend."}
{"text":"Really really good. Have gotten a sushi burrito from here and also some of the Hawaiian plates and it's good every time."}
{"text":"Right next place to my Boba place, I noticed this place opened up. I've been craving a good sushi burrito for a while so I stopped by.
Very small, but very clean and lovely staff. They were patient as we looked over the menu and ordered.
By the way, they have two menus. One is geared toward more traditional fare seen at most Hawaiian places, such as the BBQ Chicken and beef, chicken katsu, etc. 
The other menu was a sushi burrito menu. Everything from sushi bowls, sushi burritos, and of course, the build your own menu. 
We got a build your own burrito, a spam musubi, and the pork buns. My burrito had surumi crab, shrimp tempura, rice, unagi sauce, cucumbers, and mixed greens.
All I can say is YUMMMMMM. While the burrito was a bit messy and didn't hold very well, it was super yummy. Everything was fresh and well prepared. The pork buns were nice and moist inside, and I couldn't even get a bite of the musubi, so I had to listen to my partner rave over how great it was.
Only thing I'll say is I'm sad they don't have any eel! I'd come here every week if they had eel.
Overall a great experience. Come take a look!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying a sushi burrito so I have nothing to compare it to but this place was so good! The people behind the counter are very friendly and welcome any questions or suggestions you might have which is nice. I've ordered the Kaotic as well as tried their combination platter with chicken and ribs. Both were made fresh and were very filling. The business itself is smaller and appears to be very clean. There's plenty of tables inside and outside if you decide to stay and eat it there or grab it to go. I believe Postmates will also deliver from here. I definitely plan on returning."}
{"text":"I'm writing this from a near-comatose state. Seriously, AMAZING food. I got the Joerrito, minus pico and added jalapenos (I'm just not a tomato person). Great substitution, in my opinion. It was the perfect spice level.

I was perfectly full, if not a little TOO full after eating my sushi burrito. I can't imagine needing any more food. I actually could've had leftovers, but like a ravenous, under-fed hippopotamus, I inhaled it all in an embarrassingly short period of time. Self control is not something I exercise when it comes to eating. 

Aside from the food, everyone was so friendly in the store. They asked if I had been there before and welcomed me immediately. I ordered online and just ran in to grab it, so it was a super fast transaction. They confirmed in-store (without me even asking!) that they made the \"pico for jalapenos\" swap."}
{"text":"Food is so yummy! They make it fresh to order. Wait wasnt bad at all. Placed smelled and looked clean. Good portion sizes for the price.  Great customer service.  I was very happy with my first visit today . Will come back again."}
{"text":"Great customer service and the best sushi burrito in town. Highly recommended! Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped by this new place and was away at how good the food was. I love Sushi and Hawaiian food. This place had the best of both. I gound my new favorite place I'll be vom8ng by regularly."}
{"text":"Food was alright, service was really slow. If you're in a hurry I suggest order in advance. It'll be about 20 minutes wait for your food. Food is cook to order"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor- don't go. The food is not worth the long wait. Hey was very displeased. I even felt sick afterwards."}
{"text":"We were born & raised in Hawaii, so we know good Hawaiian food. We had the spam saimin & hamburger steak, both were SOOOO GOOD! Tastes just like back home, yummmm! Highly recommend, this place!"}
{"text":"Beware of undercooked chicken! Ordered BBQ chicken plate, it didn't taste anywhere near BBQ flavor. It was fried up & very greasy. Portions are huge, definitely hungry man size, it was too bad we threw away a lot of food."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi burrito in town!!!!!!!!! A very nice place to try something new with the family. Very friendly environment also. 5 stars in my book, a MUST TRY if your in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"We had a great first impression. The sushi bowl was delicious and the hawaiian bbq was perfect. Portion sizes are great and the value to food quality is on point. 
This would be the perfect place to bring someone that has not tried sushi and ease them into it."}
{"text":"Look at the garbage sushi bowl they made for me here:
https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/suha-bites-sushiburrito-and-hawaiian-bbq-las-vegas-4?select=0JPjGXTsUlL8pQduvwildQ
It's brown rice, salmon, seaweed salad and poke sauce.  This trash cost $8.50.  Their version of poke sauce is more consistent of a teriyaki sauce.

Not coming back, and if I wanted Hawaiian BBQ I'll probably drive down the street to Makai Pacific Grill on Rock Springs.

I do not suggest getting bowls here.  They have 4 options of bowls and if you decide to do custom, you're probably picking from only 4 fish proteins then the rest on the BBQ side of things. 

I didn't get a chance to try the Hawaiian BBQ or sushi burritos.  I stopped by because it takes a little bit of time for Bover to make the yummy things.

I do like how they store their items in like a cooler whereas other places leave it out and about."}
{"text":"Be patient. They're new and it takes some time to get them rolling. But it's worth the extra wait. High quality. Great food."}
{"text":"Very good price and food. Daughter 1 got miso soup and spam musubi. Daughter 2 got the California roll \"burrito\" I got the Loco moco lunch special. All of this for $16. They were so impressed with the sushi burrito and actually ate the whole thing! The loco moco was tasty, really liked the gravy. There is seating inside and outside but not a lot of space if you plan on going as a big group. I highly recommended men's this place as they check on you and are very kind."}
{"text":"The good: nice, new, modern looking casual restaurant. Very friendly staff.

The bad: only enough seating for 8 people. I'm not sure how you can have a successful quickserve restaurant like this with so little seating.  The food was not right - I ordered a combo plate with hamburger steak (tasty patty, but no gravy! what hawaiian hamburger steak comes with no gravy?) and chicken katsu (very odd; it had a thin batter coating instead of panko - so it was more like a chicken jun or something. and again, no sauce).  The mac salad wasn't right - by time I got home the heat and moisture in the take out box had reduced it to macaroni floating in a watery, milky colored puddle.

I didn't try any, but the various sushiburrito rolls looked interesting (a lot of them had the cooked hawaiian bbq meats in them)"}
{"text":"The food looked like it has been sitting for awhile And the lady serving had no clue what she was doing. I had such a bad feeling about the whole experience I ended up cancelling the order and walking out."}
{"text":"poke bowl was good but it could've been better. i hope they add more toppings. chicken katsu was good and i only ordered a small and the portions were big 
poke bowl 4/10
chicken katsu 9/10"}
{"text":"Great what seems like family owned restaurant! Hawaiian BBQ side of it is great, we live in the area and come by all the time now"}
{"text":"Not very good.  

-Kalbi ribs must have been sitting in marinade for wwwwaaayyy too long.  It did not taste good and the meat was purple from the marinade \"cooking\" it.  

-Shrimp was not peeled prior to cooking.  

Friendly service but will NOT be back."}
{"text":"So good.Love this place.So many choices! 5 star for sure! The poke bowls are fantastic. Will try there sushi burritos later.Great customer service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I are obsessed. we come here before work a couple days out of the week. The food is always great. The garlic shrimp is my favorite. It is on the saltier side, but I like it that way. The short ribs are great & if you want it more cooked/burnt a little more they'll do it just ask. The owners/worker are also very kind. They are short staffed & are in the process of hiring so please be patient with them if your food takes a little longer than expected. They just recently opened too so they are making improvements so don't be so quick to say anything bad. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"I usually order here from Uber eats, but when I finally come to the place itself, they know me! Lol honestly love the sushi burritos here and friendly all the way! Thanks!"}
{"text":"This was great! We had sushi burrito, the Hawaiian BBQ chicken and the steamed buns and it was all very good! The service was fantastic.  We live on the other side of town but will come back if we are ever close."}
{"text":"Veggie Wong sushi burrito was so delicious! I've never had one with fried tofu before. They also have a bowl you can get with tofu. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of L&L back home in hawaii. But with sushi and poke bowls. Would reccomend here. Try out the susha burritos."}
{"text":"Had been waiting for this place to open for some time now. The service was great but took a while to get my food. Which usually I wouldn't mind but I was on a lunch break. I ordered the Thai beef salad and the pork buns. The pork buns were almost $7 but they are the mass produced buns I could have bought at any store. Cold in the middle and all around not that yummy. I have been on the hunt for fresh made pork buns so I guess I am still looking. The salad was good but for $9.50 I would have hoped for something a little fresher looking. I am willing to try again but I do believe for what you get it was a little overpriced.

Update: the owner was so awesome and ran me over some warm, fresh pork buns to work. Customer service is definitely worth giving another try. Next time I go I will order the poke bowl"}
{"text":"Had a Joeritto - LOVED it!  I will definitely go back!  The spam masubi was also great!  My unadventurous daughter got a cheeseburger and fries, and they were good as well.  Yum!"}
{"text":"The food here is sooo good!!!!!!!!

I stopped by this place because I was in the area and I'm so glad I did! Chicken Katsu is a favorite of mine and it's really good here! The sauce has a great flavor and the breading is perfect! And the macaroni salad has a really good flavor too! I got a bite of the Kaotic roll and the sauce makes it so delicious! I really love anything tempura and the flavor combinations were perfect! I left in a food comma and can't  wait to go back to try more. Also they have Dr. Pepper! I love D.r Pepper!!!!!"}
{"text":"Happy I stumbled upon this place. My sushi burrito was great and the ingredients were fresh, which is always a concern when you're eating sushi. I also had the free potstickers with yelp check in, those were not nearly as good as the burrito and I wouldn't order them again. But I will be back for more sushi burritos!!!"}
{"text":"Update on my recent visit. We ordered a large garlic shrimp and it was even better this time. We asked for a side of their sweet mayo and dipped the shrimp in that...amazing! We also ordered the Pearly poke bowl with seaweed salad added to it. Portions are perfect - big scoops of crab, 2 pieces of shrimp tempura, and just the right amount of rice. Everything was fresh and tasted great. 

The staff remembered us from our last visit and greeted us as soon as we walked in. I'd forgotten to claim the potstickers on check in and he actually brought out the free potstickers to us while we were eating. Now THAT is customer service! 

I'm still really impressed by this place. The food alone makes it worth coming back. But the amazing customer service is what really makes it a stand out establishment."}
{"text":"Oh this food was so good! Great pork buns, great spam musubi and the shrimp poke bowl was sooo tasty! So much food! Best Hawaiian food I've had here in Las Vegas. Not really made to be an eat in place. Only a couple of tables and chairs and everything is served in to go containers but the food is fabulous! Will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi burritos and bowels.   Clean, healthy and fresh food.  No comment on other Hawaiian food.  Service is good.   Drink selection limited but bobo tea is next door.  Not a lot of seating so better for take out.  Like their seaweed wraps, salads and additions.  Price is right.  Convenient."}
{"text":"Ordered Hawaiian food bbq plate, loco moco, sushi burrito & tofu poke bowl. Food was excellent. The loco moco was awesome. Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"The food was good and the portions are great for the price. I've never had a sushi burrito before so I wasn't sure if I'd like it, but the one I got was very delicious!! The customer service was great as well! I will definitely go back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I was STARVING and craving a sushi burrito. Pulled out my phone and bam. There was Suha to greet me in my nearby search. The Hawaiian BBQ menu meets you when you walk in. Sushi burrito to the right. 

Totally took advantage of their Yelp check-in offer and devoured their pot stickers. Lightly fried. Served with a sweet sauce that's a blend of vinegars, chili flakes, and sugar. It almost has a plum taste to it. 

Suha Bite burrito with spam, crab, fried green onion, pineapple, and greens. Sweet, salty, and crunchy. I curbed my spam musubi craving by having something similar but burrito style. It was really tasty, well prepared, and the staff was really nice. 

It's right next to another new favorite of mine, Bover, so I like that I can kill to cravings with one parking spot. I hope my next visit is as good as this one was!"}
{"text":"My first thought when my husband asked me to eat here with him was no not another sushi burrito place. I was very hesitant, we even sat in the parking lot debating whether or not to eat here or the pho place in the same parking lot but because the reviews were better at Suha bites we decided to give it a try and it DID NOT disappoint us at all!!! The food was amazing the service was amazing and so worth it! We got the pearly bowl(amazing!!!! I highly recommend this!) with added seaweed salad on it, a kaotic burrito and a combo with chicken and beef. I never like the beef at other places it's usually very chewy and tough but here it is so good! Even though they had a large party before us they were able to make room for us to din in shortly before our food arrived. 

After such an amazing experience the first time we decided shortly before closing a few days later to treat our oldest son (who wasn't with us the first time we went). I went in to place the order and the owner was very kind no one seemed upset or pushy to get me out witch was very refreshing! I placed my order and was out in a few short mins. The owner had remembered me and asked how the kids were. There customer service is outstanding and the food is delicious will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I rate Suha Bites four stars because the Veggie Wong sushi burrito was excellent. Crisp, clean flavors, crunchy, sauced well, wrapped perfectly. The spring rolls were also very good. Super crispy outside, even the leftovers the next day. The filling was tasty but slightly mushy.
The Hawaiian side of the menu was not as impressive. Standard bbq combo plate. Chicken was fine, ribs a bit chewy. Macaroni salad was just okay. Spam Musubi was good, worth getting again.
I will most likely get the Veggie Wong again and will definitely recommend it to my vegetarian friends."}
