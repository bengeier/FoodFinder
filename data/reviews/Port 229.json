{"text":"Had a Groupon deal for this restaurant so went and tried it out having heard some good things about their burgers (and not so good things about their service).  Thank god we had a Groupon deal... I can't imagine paying for this meal full price.

We made reservations and when we arrived 5 minutes early, the waitress looked at us like she had no idea what to do with us. This restaurant is very small - only 10 tables, but there was a table for 4 and a table for 2. I'm not sure what's hard to determine on where to seat 2 people? The waitress had to ask someone else for help on where to seat us. 

Eventually got seated, ordered drinks (pop) and were told the specials. My husband ordered the burger, I ordered their steak special. My first mistake was not asking how much the steak cost. I would have expected a little under $30 and instead it was $34. A little overpriced. The burger is more than fair at $17 and a huge portion. 

The problem with this place is the absolute asinine prices they charge for pop. The two of us each ordered a Diet Coke and then asked for refills. The bill came out to $16 just for the drinks!!! 16 freaking dollars for soda!! We could by 3 cases of pop for this. Instead, we probably had 3 cans between the two of us. I had to pick my jaw up off the floor when I saw this charge. 

In terms of food, it was pretty tasty. 

For service, we had problems getting the refills (maybe we would have been better off if the service had been worse and we didn't get them at all). It also took an hour and 45 minutes for one course. I noticed the table beside us had to ask 3 times for their drink. 

Oh yes, and every table around us had bread on their table but we got nothing."}
{"text":"For sure one of the best brunch places I've gone to! It's a hidden gem in lakeshore. 
Just beware, the service is quite slow, since they only have one server and chef. But the wait is worth it!
Try the Eggs Benedialo (eggs Benedict). Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service was absolutely terrible. Anything we asked for (cream, water, more coffee) we had to ask for several times because they kept forgetting, It took what seemed like ages for our food to come out, we were 3 people and they got all of our orders wrong. Coffee was too expensive considering it tasted terrible but we kept drinking because it took forever for the food to come out. I would have given less stars if the food wasn't actually good."}
{"text":"Visited Port 229 again today perfect place to celebrate my birthday. As usual Food was fan-tab-u-lous!  I had the Red Snapper & beet salad made specifically for me for my birthday lunch! 10++ 
The salad melted in your mouth.. it was like butter! They made my birthday lunch extra special and went out of the way sure that everything was perfect. It doesn't matter if it is a weekday or weekend the service is always spectacular. Our waitress Laura was great and Dialo the top notch chef is just that....Top Notch! They made my day PERFECT! !"}
{"text":"We had a really nice, romantic meal at Port 229. We ordered the charcuterie board (we saw a photo of it on insauga.ca) and we were quite impressed: proscuitto, sausage, pate, salad, berries, all yum. We ended up ordering one of their salads as well, and on top of the bread you get with table service, we had a good, satisfying meal. I'd like to come back and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Good food but very long serve time.
Took us 45 minuted to get food. No apologies about long delays."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews as you can see based on my history but I felt I bad to share this one time because I didn't want anyone else to have such a bad experience. 
My fiancée and I went once based on some rave reviews on yelp but we have to disagree with what people have reviewed.
I live in the area and thought that I would give it a try. The ambience and environment was good, it had a great atmosphere for small bistro in port credit. Unfortunately the food and the service left me and my fiancée very dissatisfied. 
The server, who I am sure was probably the owner or the manager could not even crack a smile, and stayed very serious and unwelcoming to us. The other server was a lot more friendly but that didn't help the case with our food. We ordered the eggs benedialo and the pancakes which bother took longer than expected for breakfast foods. We thought that when we took our first bite it would make up for the long wait time. The eggs benedialo was cold as was the potatoes that accompanied it. The pancakes were probably the worst pancakes I've ever had. They were doughy and uncooked. I am not one not to waste my food. But I could not even force myself to eat what I was given. The \"breakfast potatoes\" were unevenly portioned compared to the price that was expected to be paid. 
Overall it looked as if it would be a great experience but the monotonous service from the manager/owner and the bad food will not convince us to go back. My overall comment would be that the manager/owner seemed more concerned with promoting French toast on the street to lure customers and should have focused on the people that were already in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Damn. I keep promising myself that I'm going to be tougher with my review writing, be more select with who gets a coveted 5 star. But day after day I walk into restaurants like Port 229 Artisan Bistro in Port Credit, they shock and amaze me with their service, staff and food, and here I am tossing out 5-stars like I'm 10 years old at a pool party...

Does anyone get that reference? You know when you slap someone on their bare back when you were a kid, it left a hand print and you'd yell out \"5 star!!\" while they wince in pain... anyone... anyone... Bueller....Bueller?

Well I digress, let's get back to the task at hand, revealing why Port 229 deserves this rather pleasant 5 star (review). 

To begin, the venue, while smaller (let's call it cozy), has all the elements of a hip Port side Bistro. A gorgeous full length bar, cool designs, and a BEAUT of an espresso machine. Not to mention a couple of high top tables which you may occasionally find outside for al fresco dining.

Next, the staff, Vasia was our server and she was amazing. Friendly, knowledgeable, and pretty much the perfect all around host for our little lunch party of three. In addition to Vasia we got to meet the man behind the cuisine we would soon enjoy - Chef Dialo. Such a nice guy, and between you and I (a genius at what he does). 

**Little known fact, Chef D, won BEST BURGER a the 2013 Mississauga Waterfront Festival (add THAT to you/my \"to try list\")**

Now for the main attraction, two of us decided to have the day's special: Coconut breaded white fish on a soft BUN (Autocorrect made my photo caption dirty when it wrote BUM instead of BUN) topped with a pineapple salad (salsa) and served with fresh Sweet potato fries and a chipotle aioli - $12.

Normally, I'm hesitant with anything coconut battered b/c most times it ends up being very heavy and burnt. This perfectly cooked filet didn't even resemble coconut, instead it was almost like a bread crumb consistency, however it was light and crispy and not heavy or burnt at all! Delish! What made this even more amazing was that pineapple salsa - JEEZ LAWEEZZ - seriously? Cilantro + Pineapple makes Kris a happy fella (ladies take note).

Not much more I can say about this place for now, other than strongly recommend you get your soft BUN/BUM there ASAP.

Eatcrest OUT!

PS - apparently Chef Dialo does an orgasmic french toast on weekends... just saying. I may need to be there ASAP (come with me if you will)"}
{"text":"We went to PORT 299 for our anniversary dinner last year, the whole experience was very pleasant and delightful. 

So little bit of insight on our dinner and how it went, we made reservation for 8 pm, showed up 5 minute prior, the table was ready for us, our server was very polite and knowledgeable, I ordered braised Beef ribs on mash, as I am lactose intolerant, they made a fresh mash potatoes with no dairy, that was really nice of the chef and the management.  

I totally forgot what my wife ordered, but I remember that she really like it as well.
if i had to guess, she always older NY or Filet where ever she goes, so it was probably a prime steak. 

I am the one who always tries other stuff on the menu. and I really liked everything about their restaurant and the menu, I would highly recommend this place for a date night, or dinner with friends



Please note: it is a very small but cozy restaurant, I believe they have only one booth and the tables are pretty close to each other.
They also have a full bar, and they serve food at the bar as well.
 
Overall
I would definitely return, and give them 5 Stars for their customer service.


Tips: They have paid street parking in front of the restaurant, also make a reservation if it is special night.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"This bistro is a gem along Lakeshore in Port Credit. While there are tons of restaurants in the area, this place is definitely worth a stop...or two.

The restaurant is cozy, it sits about 30 so if you're bringing a large group, reservations are a must. On our first visit today, we were seated by the kitchen. Looking in, I was surprised to see only one chef. I expected a long wait for our meals, but our food came out promptly and both dishes pipping hot.

Once we were seated and our drinks ordered, a loaf of warm bread was brought to our table. Sprinkled with rosemary and olive oil, I knew I was in trouble the moment I had my first bite of bread. Delicious! 

For our mains, my fiancé ordered the blackened Atlantic salmon served with roasted potatoes and seasonal vegetables. His meal was delicious, the salmon was moist and flakey with a caper and tomato topping, and the buttery olive oil reduction was so-so good! I may have commandeered his dish...  

I ordered the penne alla port 229 it was cooked with chorizo, shrimp, and mushrooms in a vodka tomato cream sauce. This dish was equally impressive, the vodka tomato cream sauce and garlic combination is so tasty, add in spicy chorizo and oh my goodness. I rarely ever finish my own meal, I have a wedding dress to fit into next year, but the food was just too good to stop eating. 

All in all, this restaurant is a solid 5 stars. Gentlemen, hear me out: this is an excellent date restaurant that is sure to impress. There, don't say I never tried to help..."}
{"text":"Truly delicious, conscientiously prepared and nicely presented Eggs Benedict. Bonus: the hash browns were crispy and delicious - a rarity. And the fruit salad, while small, was tasty, and a bit exotic. 
The interior is comfortable, contemporary, and built with quality materials. 
But it comes at a price: the breakfast, plus a coffee ended up being $25 with tip and taxes. It was tasty and lovely, but it's more of a treat than an everyday place for breakfast for me."}
{"text":"Very nice, small bistro feel.  However, Sunday menu is only brunch, which was kind of disappointing as I heard good things about their lunch entrees.  Eggs Benedilo (benedict) was decent, but nothing super spectacular.  Americano coffee was really good though.  

Overall, it's a nice bistro, but there are a few better places for brunch in the Port Credit area.  I'll update the review when I try their lunch."}
{"text":"SUNDAY BRUNCH

nice place for a nice quiet brunch for couples and family, definitely not for 4 chatty girls who has a lot of catching up to do. (yeah, i'm sure everyone in the restaurant heard all of our crazy stories)

This place is small and a little upscale, so perfect for small families and couples. This place fit around 30 seats and is very cramped if its all occupied. 

IS IT JUST ME OR....
brunch takes forever to be served...or maybe i'm just an angry person when i'm starving ._, 

Well this place was packed for brunch and had only one server, definitely need to hire another staff. Oh, and as if the food didn't take a long time to be served, we were actually asked to finish up quickly since they had another group coming in shortly. 

But since the food was good, i looked past the service and continue to fill my belly."}
{"text":"Went for brunch at around 1:00 and we waited maybe 15 minutes at the bar before being seated.  It's a smaller place.  Perhaps 12-14 tables.  The food did take awhile to come out but it was well worth the wait.  Our meals were hot and tasted fresh (not like some places that say reheat potatoes). Pricing for the breakfasts were maybe in the range of $14-18, but you definitely get a good amount of food.  I love the fact that there was a good amount of smoked salmon on the eggs benny!"}
{"text":"After a delicious dinner here 4 months ago, I returned today for Sunday brunch with 3 friends. 

3 of us had the Breakfast Quesadilla which came with scrambled eggs, peppers, onions and cheese, along with avocado salsa and pico de gallo. 

The menu didn't mention it, but the dish comes with homefries as well. Not knowing this, one friend ordered a side of homefries - for some reason, the server didn't let her know that homefries are already included, so she ended up with 2x amount desired.  

The quesadilla was good and filling but the peppers/onions weren't spread properly, so most bites contained either egg or pepper/onions - not both. The homefries were delicious though, best part of my meal!

The fourth friend had the Stuffed French Toast which looked decadent - she liked it. 

Note that the restaurant is small and if it's full, you'll feel cramped - definitely make reservations at least a couple days before for brunch."}
{"text":"I used to come here on a regular basis. At least once a month or  two for brunch. The service was good and food better. 
However,  this time was something totally different. It was like an episode of Kitchen nightmares. I did not see a single customer leave happy. 
Food was decent when it came out.... over an hour after we ordered. 
The server didn't come to our table even once on the patio. No apologies or information or explanation about the delay. 
We had to go in and ask the servers for coffee twice. Ketchup twice. 

The table next to us ordered a plate with pancakes as they especially wanted it. However,  after waiting for an hour and a half,  when their food was finally delivered,  the server gave them the food and then informed them that they no longer make pancakes. They had specifically ordered the dish for the pancakes and had informed them that they were ordering it because of the pancakes. 

Our water wasn't refilled once.  No server came to check on us throughout the 2.5 hours we were there. We had to get their attention by physically going to them. 

Oh and the napkin was dirty. 

When our bill came,  they had charged us extra. Upon inquiring why,  she told us that the prices had gone up for the steak, and we were to be informed when we ordered. 

A disaster through and through. 

Some pluses:
1. They made me a dish that used to be on their menu and stopped. The link - my favorite on the old menu. 
2. They moved us to the patio when a table opened up. 
3. The manager acknowledged all the issues. Said that they are working on it. And asked us to please give them another shot. But only after I informedher of our experience."}
{"text":"I was at the restaurant last night for a date-night dinner with my wife.

We both had an absolutely fantastic meal, and a great experience.  It was very slow, we almost had the restaurant to ourselves.  We tried it with a groupon deal and were both very happy with the value, quality and quantity of food received.

For the starter we ordered mussels and were pleasantly surprised at how much came in the order and the delightful sauce beneath them.

For the entree I ordered their port 229 penne, and it was delicious - the perfect balance of spice, flavorful toppings, perfect pasta.  My wife had crab-stuffed chicken and really enjoyed it, as well as the vegetables it was served with.  The staff was attentive without being overbearing (difficult when there isn't anyone else in the place to pay attention to).

We will definitely come back to try other menu items and hope to try the brunch at some point.  This was great for a date night, exactly what we were hoping for."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!!! Poor poor service! Had to continuously ask for things ie. Utensils not at table, refills, syrup. Saw our waitress once and the other waitress only served her tables didn't bother checking to see if we wanted more coffee when she was already out there. Very unfortunate for what seemed to be cool place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The venue is nice and cozy and the food is great!  We went for dinner time and towards the end of the night, they dimmed the place down, which made the place look  romantic (if you're there on a date).  I took my homegirl there for her birthday and it was such a warm place.  We had appetizer, two main course and a drink and it came to about $60.  My homegirl had the 8 oz Grilled Pork Chop and she just loved it!  She said it was moist and juicy and it was a big slab of meat on her plate!  She also got the calamari platter and that plate was like a mountain of calamari!  I had Fish Sandwich* with Spicy Chipotle Aioli.  The fish was tender with crispy batter.  I was afraid that it would be too greasy and overpowering, but the mango salsa gave it a fresh lift.  I'm not sure if they had the Chipotle Aioli on the sandwich, but I am a big Chipotle fan, so I asked for more and smothered it on my sandwich.  It's a reasonable price for the excellent quality and the amount of food they give you.  I'd definitely come back here again and try the other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"Food is good for good price, but service is lacking. Very understaffed and it shows during peaks. One server (possibly the manager) comes off as very curt and rude as well"}
{"text":"We had such high hopes for this place. As it came highly recommended. But we were so disappointed. Service is terrible and slow.  Simple touches like giving us a menu right away and topping up coffee would go a long way. Food was great once it arrived (an hour later) but nothing spectacular. 

I like the idea of not feeling rushed out the door but this experience was frustrating. 
We came for brunch and only one hour after the restaurant opened for brunch some items on the menu were sold old. Sorry Port 229, with so many other excellent options in the area I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"I went here recently to take my mom out for a birthday lunch and what an amazing treat! I told the waitress that it was her birthday and we were treated like celebrities... No joke. The customer service is outstanding at this place and the food is amazing as well. Dialo and the italian waitress (can't remember her name) went above and beyond to make my mom feel special on her birthday. 

We had a calamari to share.... I am VERY picky when it comes to calamari and this is by far the best calamari I've had in a VERY long time... It's so good I've been wanting to go back just for the calamari and the beet, goat cheese, arugula salad.... Yummmmmmo! You guys really need to check this place out for lunch and brunch. Definitely a hidden gem. Ps. The Red snapper and  garlic bread are delish!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a Groupon for Port 229, and we finally came in last week. It's a small place, and the atmosphere is quite nice-- my only criticism is that the speakers can be a bit dodgy at times, playing things a bit too loud one second a bit too low the other.

The Italian waitress was an absolute gem, she helped us pick out what we'd like to have and had no problem letting us take our time going over our menus. I didn't see much of Dialo, the chef, but he was interacting with people at the bar every few minutes which I thought was rather nice. 

We both ordered the Penne a la Port, and I loved it! The sauce is so delicious, and the ingredients used were top quality. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, the sausages were amazing, and like I said, I'm still not over that sauce. We were even given bread seasoned with olive oil and tarragon, and that was also a very nice touch. I wish there had been a burger on the dinner menu, but I'm sure if I asked next time Dialo would have no problem making it for me. My boyfriend also enjoyed the pasta, even though he's not a fan of mushrooms or shrimp-- I got to take his shrimp in exchange for some pieces of sausage from my plate.

My only criticism with regards to service, is that one of the servers seemed to be having an attitude that evening and I don't think anybody appreciated it. There was a young server in who ignored my table despite several attempts at getting her attention, and she seemed almost frustrated that we were using a Groupon instead of paying full price. She was serving another table and her tone seemed a bit off-putting, but maybe that's just me. She wouldn't even say goodbye when we left, which I think the other waitress noticed, so she was quick to step in and say all the normal polite things. Maybe the younger girl was just having a bad day, but it honestly offended me a bit."}
{"text":"Went for brunch with a few friends and I was very disappointed with the service. The server was very curt with us and was not welcoming at all.  
When my tea came, I had to ask her for milk.  When she brought the milk, I looked up to see that my friend was stirring her tea with her fork since the server didn't bring us a teaspoon.  When I asked for a teaspoon, it was very dirty with coffee grinds still stuck on it.  When I went up to the bar (where the server was) to ask for a new teaspoon, it looked like she pulled out a teaspoon from a jar of used teaspoons.  When I looked at the one she handed me, you could see the tea stains from the previous user - clearly wasn't washed.  I ended up stirring my tea with my fork as well.  
When my friend asked if she could have her French toast as a side order she replied with a very stern voice \"No\".  My friend ended up ordering it anyways, but did not enjoy it.  
Two more friends arrived a little after our food arrived and at this point, we were the only 6 people in the restaurant; therefore, the only people she had to serve.  The entire time we were there she was on her phone.  When my two friends arrived, she did not acknowledge them and they waited patiently hoping she would get off the phone to see if they wanted anything.  Unfortunately, she didn't.  So, they had to wave her over.  
When it came time to pay, three of my friends wanted to pay in cash and of course, she rudely told them that she had no change on her since it was still early in the morning.  What restaurant doesn't carry change on them?!  At least put up a sign or warn your customers ahead of time if that is the case!  
Overall, just a very disappointing experience.  Won't be going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant has gone hill, which is unfortunate as we used to frequent this place a lot. 

We asked for americanos and were given cappuccino s instead. This goes to show that management is not training the staff efficiently.

Our go to meal is;):

Blueberry chocolate chip pancakes, few times the pancakes have shown up with burnt marks around the edges, as mentioned previously service is slow and we have never bothered to complain.

Second dish is the egg Benedicts, the hash browns were the one thing I looked forward to, usually it is sprinkled with dill that makes it so tasty, which wasn't on the hash browns this time. little details matters, esp since we ve been giving our business for three years.

great breakfast joint, if you're new to the area and not too fussed."}
{"text":"Had the steak and eggs. The eggs were done beyond perfectly and the steak was almost too good to be part of a breakfast meal. I do however wish the hashbrowns were actually hashbrowns and not just homefries or diced potatoes if you will."}
{"text":"***2.5*, Review for Brunch ONLY***

Espresso machine was broken.

Went to brunch with a group of friends and as per the other reviews, YES, be prepared to wait.  After orders were placed, it was at least 20mins+ before any food arrived.  However, since we were in a group and talking, it wasn't as obvious, but do not show up hungry...especially if you are in a group.

Definite attention is paid to plating, but actual taste itself was just ok.  Nothing spectacular, less greasy/salty than other breakfast places, more on the bland side.  Portion were quite fair, especially considering the addition of the hash browns (plenty of) /fresh fruit (barely any).

Classic Breakfast with 3 eggs (any style), choice of meat, & bread was $12.95.

Coffee, which I don't think was on the menu, was a whopping $3.50.  Sorry, but I'd expect it to be cheaper than your espresso drinks...which I couldn't order 'cause your machine was broken.  :p"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Desserts to die for. Excellent wine list. Great prices. Enjoyed the atmosphere. Service was stellar. The chef was accessible and informative."}
{"text":"Have had brunch there 3 times and each time it was so delicious.  Some great choices - stuffed French toast (I ran 7k later that day so...). But also try the Classic ( ok those potatoes - just amazing) and my favourite - the Eggs Benedialo - great presentation and full taste experience.  Will have to try dinner soon."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, I'd highly recommend this place to anyone. The waitress was very nice. I ordered the Egg Benedioal and it hit the spot. It was artistic in its proportions and presentation. I later tried the Creme Brûlée, which was prepared right in front of me to my liking. Meeting the chef was a great pleasure, his passion for what he does is clearly evident. Wifi is available. All in all I'd recommend Port 229 for anyone looking for a great meal, at a good price in a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Unfortunately have changed hands more times than a ten dollar bill. Th place is inconsistent never follow their own hours, a taco can take 45 mins to be served. I used to love their food but it is all a mess now. After trying to go over four times (I live close) and it was closed at 7 pm I refuse to even look st the place. 
Avoid."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday morning.

It's a tiny spot, so come early or be prepared to wait. I us the eggs Benedict which was delicious! The plate also came with some fruit, which was a nice touch.staff is friendly, although fairly busy. Will be back for brunch again!"}
{"text":"Service was okay. Waitress was pleasant but food took forever even though only 4 tables filled and we were second to arrive.

Patio is nice as not many in the area

Brunch - egg benedict was decent. Not special.  

Not in a hurry to return."}
