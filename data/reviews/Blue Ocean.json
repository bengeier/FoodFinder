{"text":"I go here at least once a week with my wife  and or mom, the food is great and the prices are very reasonable. We love the service the staff is always super friendly and the atmosphere is very relaxing to eat and have a conversation."}
{"text":"Excellent, some of the best Satay Pho in the city! The Veggie spring rolls are also very tasty in the Bun."}
{"text":"I was in the area and was in the mood for some Vietnamese food.  I walked in and was seated by the staff within a few seconds.  There were five other tables at lunch time occupied.  I ordered #35 which was the Spring Roll with Grilled Chicken on Vermicelli.  I found the presentation of the dish decent, and it looked very tantalizing.  However, the taste of the meal lacked flavor!  The spring rolls were bland, as well as the rest of the meal.  I know where some of the best Vietnamese restaurants are, and I thought I could add another one to my list, however I was disappointed with the quality of the food.  The meal cost $11.25 and the service was decent, however I will not return."}
{"text":"I have been going here for about 2 years maybe once or twice a week. Usually the food is great and the service is quick. I would recommend for decent Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"The salad rolls and Pho were very good and the service was prompt at five-ish on a Wednesday evening.. The prices were reasonable.  The ambience was new, fresh and spacious. They have a selection of booths and tables. I forget what my friend ordered but he was happy with his food. I would definately try Blue Ocean again."}
{"text":"Food is great, served fast, as expected, and the price is right. Bubble tea was a bit smaller than expected but its prepared right and I'm willing to overlook the size. Customer service was fast and friendly and I'll be coming back again. Looking for pho, come here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are Pho addicts and have tried literally dozens of places in town. This place is still, our go to place, every time! The broth is perfect, beef is always fresh and satay sauce is our favourite. We eat here at least once per week and have never left unsatisfied. Prices are very reasonable and environment is relaxing and enjoyable. Servers are always smiling and friendly and it's always a great pleasure to dine at Blue Ocean!"}
{"text":"Some of the tastiest Vietnamese food I have tried in Calgary, especially south of Memorial.  Service is friendly and attentive, prices are good, and everything is jam packed with flavour and quality ingredients.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We're pretty picky with our Vietnamese having grown up with it all of our lives. The portions here were large enough to fill my husbands belly. The broth was rich in flavor and has a pleasant taste during and after eating. I had bun. Their fish sauce was thr perfect mix. Not too sour or sweet. The only difficulty was turning in if you're coming from the south McLeod trail. I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"We had a really nice meal here.

I can't speak to the pho since I don't eat beef or pork but their spring rolls and grilled chicken on vermicelli was delicious. The portion was large, prices reasonable and the service was fast.

There was a large family of Vietnamese ancestry sitting at a table next to us, also visiting the restaurant for the first time and they were singing the food's praises, so I take that as a positive. 

The restaurant is clean, with a casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"A great place to sit and enjoy a meal.  The restaurant is clean and tranquil with great service.  The menu has a lot to offer but from what other customers were ordering around me, it doesn't look like you could order anything wrong."}
{"text":"Pros: The price is great, clean interior, portions are huge, and food is fast and fresh.

Cons: Service is frustrating, lack of flavour.

I only gave Blue Ocean three stars as going there to sit in can be really frustrating. And the food is good, but far from the traditional \"straight from Vietnam\" Vietnamese food that can be found in Calgary.

When I sit down I have to order right when the serve comes, as if I don't there's no telling when she will come back to take my order. I've waited for a glass of water for over ten minutes once, and it was nearly empty in the place. I've had to stand up and go up to a server and ask for assistance.

The pho is definitely the most flavorful option on the menu. But it's inconsistent. Sometimes I may get a lot of rice noodles in my pho, other times it can be mainly broth. The other dishes like the lemongrass chicken are good, but needs more sauce and flavour. Considering how many Vietnamese places there are in Calgary they should work on improving this."}
{"text":"Because this restaurant is a block from my home, I very regularly order the seafood satay noodle soup (#26) after work and bring it home for a nice comfort food dinner. The portion is hefty, and the flavouring is good. I usually ask for an extra helping of seafood meat."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from Blue Ocean using skipthedishes several times. I tried the Tomyum Chicken Noodle Soup, Satay Beef Noodle Soup, Won-Ton Chicken Soup and Chicken Salad Rolls. I've also tried the coconut and taro bubble tea. It was all very good but the won-ton soup was a bit different because the won-tons were deep fried and seemed to get quite soggy with the broth.I will definitely be using this restaurant as one of my go to's for Vietnamese soup but probably won't be getting the won-ton soup from here anytime soon."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and the subs were very good, i had the satay beef and my friends had the satay chicken, we all liked our subs. I also liked the spring rolls and the bubble tea. My only complain was The service : it was veeeeery sloooow... they should improve their service time, specially at lunch when most people is in a rush. The place was not really busy. I couldn't understand why I took them so long to bring the subs to us."}
