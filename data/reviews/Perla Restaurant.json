{"text":"If you like Portuguese food, It doesn't get more authentic than this. Grandma's cooking is amazing! Both the baked and grilled baccalau (salted cod) are fantastic. Also try the pork and clams. As a starter, either the clams or collard greens soup will make your belly very happy. Wash it all down with a Sagres (Portuguese beer) and the world is a wonderful place."}
{"text":"I don't usually write a review on my first visit to a restaurant and certainly not until I've had a good feel for the menu and food.   This review is an exception.  I want to give a big shout out to Perla to commend and thank them for the wonderful experience they provided to my father and his friends on the occasion of his 65th birthday party.  Perla accommodated our large 30-odd person party.  We dominated their entire small dining room.  We were loud and boisterous.  Speeches were made.  Wine was drunk.  It was difficult for the wait staff and kitchen to deal with us.  But deal with us they did, and wonderfully so.  When you think about how this is a family run business owned and run by a mother and daughter (mom in kitchen, daughter front of house), it becomes even more amazing.  Thank you, Perla for giving us such a wonderful experience.    No review is complete without a mention about the food.  I had the grilled sea bass.  It was served whole and was deliciously done.  Just the right amount of flavour, and simply made as I understand it should be a-la Portuguese style.  We shared appetizers, all of which were quite good albeit simple.  Reminded me of the rustic food that one would serve at home in Portugal (although I am no expert).  My partner and I are definitely thinking of going back to try the rest of their menu.  A big thank you to Perla for patiently dealing with our party and for providing a special event for my father.  A big thank you as well to Perla's faithful customers who had to bear with our rowdy party.  Just the way a true community restaurant should be!"}
{"text":"Great service very mom and pop type restaurant. Food will all way be good as long as \"mama\" is in the back making the food. Very simple Portuguese food and good flavours."}
{"text":"Good food and quality/price are also a nice deal.   Portuguese decorations and food.   Very good staff!    We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have had my eye on this quaint looking restaurant for a few years - had no idea it was Portuquese- but the fish menu appealed to me -   Finally decided to treat myself- but not to fish as I rarely have meat .  Started with a delicious vegetable soup - basket  of bread with two spread options - one soy ( not crazy about it ) and mix veg pate/ spread that was tasty - and of course lots of Olive Oil  dipping on the other side-   I ordered the steak  with fries and a fried egg , a couple of black olives and a mushroom reduction sauce. .Tasty - meat was tender . It was a quiet night - service was friendly - Very reasonable menu prices.  Soup $4 - that's almost unheard of .   I was wondering why a plastic ketchup bottle was place on my table - then realized it was for the fries - a small ramekin would have been nicer - I just pushed it off to the side so as to not look at it - Not a huge deal but I wasn't in a burger joint .   All fish /plates of the day were 18.00   My total bill with tax was just over 17 -   My  server noticed I was riding a motor bike and assumed correctly that I would not should not be drinking -  Good for her.   I Absolutely would go back -"}
{"text":"Perla is a modest-looking spot that doesn't try to match the forced attempts at hipness of many of its Little Italy neighbours. Until a visit the other day, I had barely noticed Perla at all.  But there we were, looking for a quick pre-concert bite, and the simple menu called to us.   Perla, it turns out, is Portuguese, as evidenced by the caldo verde soup on the menu, and the heavy emphasis on seafood. The look and feel of the interior, as well as the friendly, informal service, recall the old Dundas St. vibe rather than College St. So far, so good.  And what of the food? Sadly, that's where Perla falls down. Caldo verde, the ubiquitous Portuguese potato and kale soup, is thin, its sausage chunks chewy and full of cartilege. Grilled calamari is bland and swimming in oil. A grilled chicken breast is hard to mess up; this one is blessedly not overcooked, but the accompanying rice and iceberg-lettuce salad are, well, a big yawn.  I hate TV's Restaurant Makeover with a passion. But if any place could use remedial help from a real chef, it's this one."}
{"text":"I've joined the Portuguese Mafia...seriously. So to celebrate, what better than to visit little Italy......  Somebody made reservations, thank God, because there were eighteen of us, and the restaurant was the size of a living room. I've never been to an authentic porkchop restaurant before.  The art on one side of the room was traditional..I think. But on the other side it was something completely different. I don't really remember what it was, because I used the canvas as headrest. Bad ass. Yeah? I get that they wanted to bring out all our food all at the same time, but it took one hour! I had to ration my beer! Although of course I wasn't paying. Cause I'm G like that. Seriously though, I got here at 1pm, and the food came 2:15. I think they only had one cook. It was sort of like an open concept kitchen, only the counters were so tall I couldn't see anything but heads.  I ordered the salted fish with calamari. I don't know which part of the fish it was, but there was so much bone I was unable to eat half of the fish. Picking at the fillet was so much work it made Korean BBQ seem like a vacation. But what do I know, I was the only Chinese guy in the room. Everyone else ordered better looking dishes, and it seemed like very hardy food. Imagine the most generously portioned dish at Milestones, placed on a plate that was appropriate for it's size. So...not like Milestones. The waitress whom I suspected of being the owner didn't get my order of calamari, so I ordered again. When it came, it was just squid, no breading, no coating of any kind. I was afraid of it being too fishy, but it wasn't. My fish was too chewy, and my squid was too..squidish. I gawked at everybody else's meals the entire time, wishing I ordered pork, or fries.  My buddy got the platter of seafood. The rice on the bottom was so drenched in sauce, it might have been a soup. Still looked better than mine though. I don't know whether if this was authentic, it looked authentic. The space was painted blue, so that's how I felt throughout my lunch.   The area is just teaming with hipsters, I felt like I was trespassing with my suit and all. But it was the good looking ones, so I remained civilized.  Perla. Perlaaa.....I just can't think of anything clever to say."}
{"text":"Loved this little place because the food and service were excellent.  I had a pan fried fish dish what was simple but excellent, and my wife had a beef entree that she loved.  This restaurant seemed to attract local business people on lunch break.  A great little place, with an informal patio in the back."}
{"text":"What a surprise!  From the outside it looks quaint, though the front patio was occupied by some angry people. Inside it got better, presented as a family run restaurant. It was a hot summer night so we decided to eat on the yet I seen back patio. There was nothing redeeming about it. The ground was cluttered with an abundance of toys making it hard to get around our table. Promptly water and bread was dropped off. The water was ok but the bread was our exit note. The basket was filled with at best day old buns and literally broken pieces of white bread slices tha rang out when I tapped them on the table. The prices were 20-30% higher than listed on the online menu.   I would add another two $$ to the price rating. Would not recommend this disaster to anyone I didn't really like and warn others not to go. We promptly left and went to another neighbor hood place and enjoyed a descent meal."}
{"text":"This little restaurant in the heart of little Italy own by mother and daughter will impress you. We had a nice lunch but also  they are open for take out. In the past the order will take forever but we were impressed how quickly the service was today. The Portuguese pottery decor will transport you to Lisbon. Food was very tasty and the service was so good. In the summer there is a patio in the back.I totally recommend to check it out."}
{"text":"Family-owned restaurant serving traditional Portuguese dishes, I've been eating here for years and the quality of the food has always been consistent.  In the past, I've dined on weekends. I ate lunch on a weekday the last time I was in and was pleasantly surprise to see the number of regulars who were in to eat or pick up takeout. Decor is a mix of antiques and traditional Portuguese items."}
{"text":"Perla is one of those places that gives a feel of a missing engine... It sort of goes, but never smooth. Sorry for the technicality! :-)  The entrance and design were not attractive at all, but we dropped in simply because we were hungry and wanted to eat something with a pronounced Latin flavor.  Menu was not impressive, or maybe we were expecting more from a Portugal restaurant. Maybe the owners are Portuguese, but their restaurant was not. Just a usual \"americanese\" food. It was ok, but nothing special to talk about.  Service was on a slower side, which annoyed a bit too much, keeping in mind that we really wanted to eat like right now! Yet the server was polite and nice, so after all we've survived and were ok.  Overall - I would eat that for brunch, or when hungry - but neither the food nor the place are not worth travelling distances to taste."}
{"text":"Having a craving for fish we decided to check out Perla on the outskirts of Little Italy. Located on the south side of College Street the place features an exposed brick wall and a lovely deep washed blue wall and windows that look north on to College and a small patio. At the back of the restaurant is a bar that runs the width of the restaurant and an exposed kitchen grill. The place is small enough that it offers the feel of a family-run restaurant.   Because it was still a little cool we sat inside (they hadn't yet opened the patio) at a table facing the street. The windows facing College Street open and I am sure offer the feel of bistro in the summer. The tables are simple and yet elegant, white table cloths with white squares of paper laid on top. Each table was dressed with a bottle of olive oil and vinegar which is always a good sign for the food that will follow.   The food is Portuguese inspired featuring a large selection of fish and seafood in the main menu and appetizers. There is however a large meat selection for any carnivores. The service was polite, friendly and attentive to the food allergies of our group making sure we knew which options could be prepared to order. We opted for a selection of appetizers and everyone was delighted not only with the quality of the freshly prepared food but also with the quantity. The mains that followed were equally well portioned and delicious.   It is one of those places that offers a languid dinner, enjoying the view of the street, the food and the service. It was a wonderful dining experience   and recommended for anyone searching for a casual, pleasant dinner."}
