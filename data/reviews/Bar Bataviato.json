{"text":"A hidden gem tucked away above Little Sister. They open at 630, but I was early, and the staff at Little Sister were kind and let me sit and wait at their bar.  The space is super cool - soft couches, dark lighting, great music playing. One bartender to service the entire place.  We saw people come and go (mostly pre dinner drinks, a few first dates) but it was mostly not very busy from 630-900.  Thursday night is neighbourhood night - any can of beer or cider is $5.  They have a menu item where you pick your spirit and the flavour profile you want of your drink and the bartender invents something for you - mine was super yummy!    The food menu is hella small, and only has snacks. No real options for vegetarians.  The fried chicken was delicious, definitely get that. The rest only serves the purpose of keeping your hunger at bay. With a better food menu, I'd give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"We stumbled into this place one day on our way home, when my boyfriend suddenly said he wanted a drink. It was Friday night, we just saw how crowded it was downstairs at the Little Sister Indonesian restaurant. So out of curiosity, we went up stairs and found this amazing little place!  It's a very intimate space, small and cozy! Perfect for a date or friends get together. There is a bar where you can sit at, or at the lovely wrap around velvet sofa. The decor is lovely, definitely played a big role in the vibe.  As for the drinks, they had a pretty interesting menu of cocktails, a small but carefully curated selection of wine, also had all the traditional drinks you would want.   Definitely will come back to this place for a date night!"}
{"text":"So for midtown this is a super cool bar with great drinks and delicious snacks! I will definitely go back! The place is small and cozy and bartenders are super friendly. But the service is not very fast but we didn't really care."}
{"text":"Intimate upstairs bar with creative cocktails. It's an Indonesian/Dutch concept.   The food downstairs at Little Sister is great, as their sister restaurant Noorden just up the street.   This is a very well-made and presented Pisco Sour."}
{"text":"Pssssst...hey you. Yeah, you: the attractive person reading this review. There's a hidden cocktail bar just south of Yonge & Eglinton called Bar Batavia. But it's a secret, so don't tell anyone.   Actually nevermind, TELL EVERYONE BECAUSE THIS PLACE IS AWESOME.  Head up the stairs above Little Sister (Indonesian resto) and voila, there's a speakeasy-style joint with excellent cocktails, yummy bar snacks and a cool-ass vibe.  They have a list of signature cocktails but will also happily mix up a custom libation based on the spirit and style you prefer (last time I was there I asked for \"ginny citrusy\" and Dave requested \"bourbony smokey\").  We need more places like this uptown so definitely come here and don't keep it a secret!"}
{"text":"We were enjoying a mini bar crawl on a sunny Friday night when we decided to make Bar Bataviato our final stop. We made our way upstairs and immediately found a cozy table by the bar.  We spent some time perusing their promising drink menu and eventually settled on the Weekly Punch, which we got in the Punch Your Friends size. (It's a small bottle, basically.) It's a tasty drink; fruity and refreshing, it was pretty much exactly what we wanted. I will say, though, that the alcohol content seemed very low, like maybe a couple of ounces in the entire bottle. So that was a little disappointing.  I was also feeling a little peckish, so I decided to try their Rendang Taco, which I figured would consist of the amazing Beef Rendang they serve downstairs at Little Sister. I was not wrong, and this thing was amazing. I could've eaten, like, five of these."}
{"text":"I enjoy this bar a lot because of their custom cocktails. You can just order with the bartender of the spirit you want and prefer taste, and they will create something on the spot according to your desire. You can always have something new and not be so routine about your choices."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere. Small, intimate space.  Unfortunately, service is very slow. We had to wait half an hour between drink orders and to pay the bill."}
