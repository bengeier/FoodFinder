{"text":"This was my husband's and mine first AYCE sushi place back in the day. It is a special place for us when we were just starting out. We went back for old time's sake for on a weekday night last week and the sushi and tempura were good. You get a choice to eat off the 16.99 AYCE or the 14.99 one. Not the top best but the price is good. The service is nice with a smile. Keep in mind this is in the university area and meant to be affordable. If you are looking for a good place and quick. There were many people coming in for pick up. I realized at the end of the meal that I forgot to take pictures so only managed to get the vegetarian rolls.  Which they have many vegetarian options. Also the fried banana tempura with chocolate is yummy!"}
{"text":"Yelp, please allow a 0 star rating. That's what this place would get.   WAY too much rice, rude service (a friend who speaks the language mentioned a few times that the staff were making comments about customers that were racist and homophobic on top of everything else) bugs on the walls, fish isn't even close to fresh, etc. etc.  I would write more, but I feel as though the sushi strip community has already covered all the finer points of why this place is a huge AVOID - the low price IS NOT worth it. RUN to Sakura Garden across the street for ayce! or Sushi on Bloor. Or even New Generation, if you must, but don't go to this place!"}
{"text":"This place was great! The service was good and the fish was fresh. I'm a huge sushi fan and this place delivered. it's the only place on the Danforth actually run by Japanese people and it shows. This is the best all you can eat in east York. The atmosphere is that of a simple restaurant but don't be fooled! I will keep coming back for sure."}
{"text":"A friend suggested we meet here for dinner. I agreed, then looked it up and was horrified by the reviews, and fearful of food poisoning. I told my friend that I would like to go conditionally--we could pop our heads in and if it looked okay, we could stay.  It looked okay, when checked out the place--maybe a little unpleasant, in that some of the tables were uncleared and so on, but this might just have been busyness. It was pretty full, with only a couple of seats going to spare. The woman who seated us seemed curt and sullen, however, there was a man who served our table for the most part (the woman refilled our tea once). The man was friendly, smiling and helpful.  We went for AYCE. And it was fine. I didn't get food poisoning, which always raises my rating of a restaurant where raw fish is served by one star.*  So it was fine. And the rolls were... fine. The ones made for us last night didn't look like they were made by a \"blindfolded 8 year old cutting with a hacksaw\" (as another reviewer eloquently put it--perhaps a different sushi chef, or else she encountered she same sushi chef as we did, but at the beginning of his career, and how he's in that mid-career slump). On the other hand, perhaps that would have made them more interesting, at least visually? They were pretty standard AYCE, generally. Taste-wise, they were fine, but not fabulous. Each piece of my dynamite roll was too big to manage in one bite, and we all know that this makes for some messiness, as you have to do it in two bites, the flavours don't blend the same way, and unless you're that special combination of skilled and lucky, it falls apart while your'e chewing your first bite. But it was fine. Nothing to write home about (home being Vancouver, where sushi is generally yum and less uneven than the stuff out here, it seems).  One special note is the spicy salmon roll. Last summer at a sushi place on the Danforth whose name I do not recall, a friend warned us away from the spicy rolls. He said that they use crappy cuts of fish and disguise it with the spicy sauce. I had never heard of such a thing--we often have sushi out in Waterloo (as we live there part time), and it has always been fine--the same cut of fish as the regular roll, with some spicy sauce drizzled over.  Last night, I saw what my friend meant. The spicy salmon roll featured finely chopped salmon, mixed with the spicy sauce--and closer examination confirmed that yes, the lighter stuff in the chopped meat side was not merely sauce, but also fatty, less appealing bits. I tried a bite and this reinforced my friend's warning, which I now pass on to you, with the note that at least for now, in Waterloo, this is not the case. There, the spicy rolls are not crappy cuts of meat disguised by spice. But sadly, at least some AYCE places here, no doubt faced with higher overhead and fierce competition, seem to have decided to take short cuts where they can least afford to--on the food itself, while hoping that the flat rate AYCE pricing will make up for it. The fact that I won't rush back to this place indicates that at least for me, the pricing doesn't make up for it--I'd rather have a tasty bento box, well-prepared, than such mediocre AYCE.   *I think my rating would more accurately (from the descriptions) be \"meh--I've had better\" because this is precisely true. But, most people seem to be writing really horrid reviews alongside their two star ratings, so I assume that 2 stars is actually more negative than that and three stars is more of a \"meh\" in practice. I'm going with that."}
{"text":"BEWARE AND STAY AWAY!!!!  For all the local foodies and those who prefer quality customer service. DO NOT go to this restaurant. Mariko Japanese was utterly disappointing.  For fear of ranting, I'll try to be straightforward about this. We made a decent size order on what we assumed would arrive in reasonable portions(it is an all you can eat after all) the sizes that came were gargantuan. Starting with udon noodles that was the size of a full entree(oversized) after a minor complaint to the owner who barely acknowledged our annoyance the rest of the food came.. Which was just as ridiculously large followed by more of a sour attitude. My boyfriend and I head to pay the bill and left promptly to take photos of the resto to review later. The owner rampages outside shortly after our departure and begins PUNCHING my bf.. Yes I said it my fellow foodies.. Punching incessantly.. Then runs back inside to grab two glasses of water and douse him and myself with it.. As well as an innocent bystander.. There are no words.. Other than BEWARE and stay away. This was both staggering and unacceptable.  Service:0/10 Food:1/10 Experience:0/10  Downright awful"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!   This place has turned myself and my wife off sushi for a while.  The sushi was 95% rice which tasted like it had been sitting in vinegar all day.   We could not eat it.   We told the server about the issue but she could not care less. We just wanted to pay and get out."}
{"text":"The worst sushi i've ever had in my life! it took more than half an hour to get our food (and they were not busy), when we did finally get it the food was inedible. the rice was soggy & so was the tempura. The staff was barely competent and even after interrogating me as to why i could not eat more than 5 pieces would not even take a dollar off the almost 30 that disgusting meal cost me."}
{"text":"The service was terrible, the all you can eat menu was overpriced and everything came out at once instead of serving courses (how difficult is it to bring miso soup and salad out before the rolls?). Unlike most AYCE places, this one did not include pop or ice cream and it cost $16.99 for lunch, so the value and quality was just lacking. The atmosphere was dank and I did not see either server smile once, they were just miserable. I really do not recommend going here, there were no redeeming qualities."}
{"text":"We're regulars here, often going on a weeknight after work.  We get great food -- though sometimes a bit uneven. Never had soggy tempura here (or agedashi dofu), though occasionally have had sashimi that was still a bit cold from freezing. Never had poorly rolled rolls, or otherwise sub-par food.  No language barrier for us, and we have an established relationship with the servers/chefs. Under these circumstances, the food is excellent.   It is not quite as clean as it used to be before the remodel, and service can be, but isn't always, a bit slow. But for the price, its been unbeatable for an all-you-can-eat sushi fix."}
{"text":"While I haven't tried the all you can eat yet, I generally go here for a cheap satisfying lunch during school. The quality isn't that great but also not bad.. quite mediocre. For $6 lunch take-out with 12 pieces of maki,soup and salad you really can't go wrong.   One of the waitresses seemed quite nice while the other (who I see the most often) seems to always be in a bad mood and never smiles. It's not a huge problem though, and the fact that my food is always made quickly makes up for it (I usually don't call ahead, just drop in and leave with my takeout within 5-10 minutes)."}
{"text":"WORST DINING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE....  We went in for the 10.99 all u can eat...  The service was slow and sub-par  but this didn't really bother me... The food was really bad and the worst sashimi I have ever tasted...but still whatever it was only 10.99 right?  Well  when i went to pay they wanted to charge us 17.99, even though all of the banners say 10.99.  After a brief argument the one waitress called the manager on the phone screaming in Japanese  and finally charged us 10.99, still insisting she told us when we ordered that we were getting the more expensive menu??  SHE DID NOT....  This is where it gets good...  she than yells at me saying Im never welcome again.. I said fine...this is the worst sushi I have ever had and I wouldn't dream of coming back..she than barked  at me again.   At this point I had enough and told her where to go, at which point the waitress turned around and slapped me in the face twice  YES  she actually physically assaulted me!!!   But it didnt stop there!  She then shoved me into a table...After this I unleashed hell fire on her and ran out.  I'm still pondering pressing assault charges just not sure if i want to waste any more energy on it... I'm still shocked it happened....Difficult customer or not you NEVER lay a hand on a customer.  The place was full as well with a lot of witness's."}
{"text":"Cheap sushi, especially for all you can eat. But I've had my order \"rejected\" from delivery because it's too busy in the restaurant... definitely not good enough to warrant that."}
{"text":"I work at a restaurant as a food runner, and if there is one immutable law of bringing food to a table, it is that you serve all the people at the table as close to simultaneously as you can. I came here with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago, and, given that we are a mere table of two, the difference in time between our receiving of meals should be measured in split seconds. It wasnt. My meal came first, and when it became apparent that hers wasnt coming any time soon, I tried my utmost to exercise self-control in eating my meal. Given that I was sure the fish wasnt the freshest to begin with, I didnt much like the idea of sitting and watching it get older, but propriety demanded it of me. About 15 minutes later, we had both had enough. I was given the green light to begin eating. By the time I was finishing my meal, roughly 15 minutes after that, her meal finally came out. Her avocado Salad consisted of  a whopping amount of iceberg lettuce and a whole quarter of an avocado. We both left the restaurant in a pissy mood, and our hunger was only slightly put off. I spent the next 10 hours skirting around illness. As far as cheap sushi on bloor goes, you can get better for cheaper."}
{"text":"Disaster.  Yup, it's tough to find a 1 star but they've managed to do it.  Let's sum up quickly, we left after 20 minutes having eaten 30% of our meal because the other 70% was either still frozen or had flies on it. The grossness of the latter point is due to the fact that we sat outside and mid-meal, they brought their compost garbage to the curb (at 6pm for a midnight pickup???) so millions of flies and wasps descended...not to mention the wretched odour. After complaining and having no response as most of the servers and staff didn't speak a lick of English we quickly asked for the bill and bolted.  Disaster."}
{"text":"Too much rice filled with vinegar. Subpar if not rude service and stairs that you can die on walking to the washroom where you will want to vomit from the overpriced, terrible eating experience you just had. Got sick from eating here and regret giving these owners any money.   Don't believe the signs or the location, this place will be bankrupt soon and is a disgrace to sushi everywhere.  Head over to Big Sushi, Sushi on Bloor or really anywhere on the street you will have food that is 30x tastier with much nicer staff."}
{"text":"Good service and a lot of vegan and vegetarian choices in a super reasonably priced \"all-you-can-eat\" @Bloor & spadina. Consistent quality and bottomless tea. We keep coming back and I am sure they sustain a heavy loss with my s/o that puts away enough vegan sushi to feed a small village..."}
{"text":"worst sushi place ever!  The food is not fresh (you can see black stuff on the avocado).  The fish is not fresh also, the taste is a bit weird.  There are orders missing so we have to order again. When the order came, there is soooooooooooo much rice on the roll (i never see that much rice in a roll).  Even the yam tempera is not sweet.  Worst place ever.   too bad i forgot to take picture of the food to prove myself."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews of this place. I have been several times and have always enjoyed the food and found the service to be very good. I have never had an issue with quality and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Mariko.  I eat a lot of sushi and I have most of the sushi restaurants in the area. Mariko is as good as any of the others."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. RUN. FAST!! (and pray that you can hold your diarrhea in until you get home).  Food is horrible.  The AYCE signs outside are a come-on, and the whole thing is a scam because the rolls are 90% rice.  Fish is NOT FRESH. And they serve the cheapest (i.e., fried/rice-heavy) items first and conveniently 'forget' about the sashimi, etc.    Staff is incredibly rude.  Floors and tables are filthy- would hate to see what their kitchen looks like if this is their cleanliness standard.  Partner and I were sick for days after.  Not sure how they are still in business...?"}
{"text":"Just don't eat here, trust me. They forgot our order not once - not twice- but FIVE TIMES. Each time we had to fill out a new order sheet and give it to them and they lost it each time! Not to mention the food was an embarrassment. How this place is still in business is beyond me."}
{"text":"One word: mediocre. The rice was hard, the fish was poor quality, and the sashimi cuts were small and sad. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone in the area. Service was poor and there were an incredible amount of flies in the restaurant. Without those flies, this would be a 2 star."}
{"text":"Definitely not the best sushi place to be found in the area. Not that it's particularly bad or anything but it just doesn't live up to the standards set by its competition. Food was average and they didn't have the torched sushis, service was surprisingly slow since they had about three servers working and not a lot of people to serve.  If you're ever in the area looking to have some sushi, do yourself a favor and walk down the street to another restaurant."}
{"text":"I've come here way more times than I can count, and I find Mariko to be a top-notch place for sushi on a budget. For just over $15 you can get AYCE of plenty-palatable fish (and whatever else you want). I eat a lot of salmon and tuna, and they are always good+. On a few lucky occasions I've gotten outstanding tuna that melts in your mouth like butter. I'm not a fan of the sushi pizza, but everything else I've eaten has been very enjoyable: dumplings, skewers, seaweed salad, various rolls, nigiri, sashimi. Ambiance is not great, and the plastic water cups sometimes taste like cleaner, but I find Mariko to be a solid sushi meal at a great price."}
{"text":"Horrible, Disgusting, and ridiculous.   Do yourself a favour and pay an extra 5 dollars for quality food."}
{"text":"I came for the AYCE and remind me never to go for all you can eat.  MSG induced perhaps?  I never feel like I get my dollars worth since I don't eat that much...  I've had their lunch specials which were ok.  Unfortunately I don't remember what I ordered but it was your standard annex sushi bento box..."}
{"text":"After reading all the other reviews on here, I guess we got lucky tonight?  The servers seemed tired, but service was still good. We were promptly served our tea and water when we sat down, and the two waitressess tag-teamed our table returning multiple times through the meal to top up both types of drinks.  We came for the All You Can Eat (AYCE) dinner on a moderately busy Saturday night - there may have been 4 or 5 other tables being served along with us. On the weekends, the price is apparently raised by $1, so instead of it being $15.99 now, it's $16.99 on a Saturday (and I can only assume that applied to Friday and Sunday as well). (note: they did have the \"lower\" menu for $12.99 weekend price, but my buddy said that one doesn't come with Sashimi, so we went with the higher priced one.  The sushi was good. It wasn't great (I lived in Vancouver and have had GREAT sushi back in the day) but in my opinion it wasn't gross as some have suggested by any means. The presentation on our plates was also nice, as our multiple rolls and sashimi came out nicely presented (and our white salmon sashimi - which comes in thin strips - was presented looking like the flower of a rose, a beautifully artistic interpretation that I hadn't seen before.)  Sashimi was quite good. Nice and fresh. No complaints. Sushi rolls do come with a lot of rice, but they were tasty too. They had a few rolls I'd never seen before like the \"Excellent Role\" (I know, how awesome of a name is that!) which was shrimp and banana. My girlfriend and I felt adventurous and tried it and it worked really well in our opinion.  On the AYCE menu there was only 1 dessert, tempura friend Banana, which they pour a little chocolate over, and it was actually quite tasty. When we finished, they also offered us complimentary ice cream (Green Tea or Coconut flavours).  Overall, this place wasn't as bad as I was expecting. I've had better sushi, but I was spoiled living a few years on the west coast. The AYCE menu is pretty thorough with lots of choice, and the price is decent. I've not had much Sushi yet in Toronto since moving here, but this place was pretty good for what you got.  I want to say 3.5 stars, but that's not an rating option in Yelp, so this restaurant will benefit from the automatic round-up to 4-stars."}
{"text":"The best part about Marikos is the price. 16.99 for a large selection of sushi. My girlfriend and I used to come here almost every other week (some months once a week). Sadly when i went by on December 12th there was an eviction notice in the window. Heartbroken i made my way to one of the many other restaurants around. RIP Marikos Sushi"}
{"text":"My partner and I are regulars here and WE LOVE IT.  The food is AMAZING and cheap as it gets for AYCE.  That being said, if you are expecting ambiance and five star service, you're at the wrong place.   We have never really had an issue with service, in fact, because we are regulars, we have established a relationship with the regular server and the chefs; as such, when they are in we get special treatment (free drinks, special sushi not on the menu, etc.). Bottom line, for the price, the quality of the food is top notch but you won't get much else unless they get to know you."}
{"text":"Not the best.  Not by far.  But hey, its all you can eat so I guess you just have to accept how mediocre all the food is."}
{"text":"Why oh WHY did I let my stomach sucker me into coming here?  I know I say this about pretty much every Japanese restaurant except Japango, Asahi and Yuzu no Hana, but this has to be the worst one in Toronto.  OBVIOUSLY it is run by Chinese folk, not Japanese, which makes it all the more obvious why it sucks. I asked for a substitution and they said: NO CAN DO, until I offered to pay more money to avoid eating crap. *rolls eyes*  I ordered the Wakame Salad, which came drenched in a disgustingly sweet sauce of sesame. Not a drizzle, a SOUP of dressing covering the few leaves of wakame is not my idea of a good Japanese salad.  The miso soup was standard but I only got 2 tofu cubes.  I also got the chicken teriyaki which was not what I was expecting, it came as a sizzling hot plate instead of drenched in that thick lovely soy sauce and flavoured beautifully. It lacked seasoning, was on a bed of horribly cooked onions and carrots, and I was so hungry, I ate it all.  But I am never coming back, and if you had a smartphone (unlike me, as I am internet-less most of the time I am out of the house), you would have yelped this and avoided it like the effing plague."}
{"text":"This isn't somewhere one goes for the ambience and I'm sure the service varies depending on who's working on a particular evening, but I went here for the first time with a friend last night, and our waitress was very friendly and helpful. The sushi was also fresh, delicious, and well prepared (the $17 AYCE)."}
{"text":"Decor/ Ambience:  Rundown, grimy, flying insects, sticky looking tables, waitresses wiping down tables with greyish looking dirty rags  Service:  Waitresses were sweet and friendly but food came out slow. The last sushi plate we ordered didn't even come with ginger or wasabi.  Food:  Ordered the all you can eat from the larger menu.  Initially we had decided on ordering from the 70 item menu but the sushi selection is SERIOUSLY lacking.  They offer only a few vegetarian type maki rolls and the typical kitchen stuff.  Okay, so the rice was extremely bland.  The meats/ combination was mediocre.  All in all, sushi was a little below average.  We never got everything we ordered either ... had to order the spider roll THREE times before we finally got it ... I think the chef selectively leaves off the more expensive rolls hoping that the diner will forget.  We overheard other guests complaining about the same thing.    Ordered the agadashi tofu and it was not bad except there was a bleach taste - ugh :(  Ordered some other tofu appetizer and it was absolutely disgusting - it was cold and had these bark like paper things on it.  I have tried a similar type of tofu dish at other restaurants and it was much better.  My husband ordered the udon - he didn't say much about it, it didn't look that appetizing, and I had no desire to have a taste.  Left the restaurant feeling disappointed - oh well!  On to the next all you can eat sushi adventure :)"}
{"text":"Let me just first say, it takes a LOT to make me complain. In fact, tt takes the most unbelievably atrocious quality of food and service to make me complain. You know the kind of restaurant ratings that typically get a 2 star or less rating on yelp? Well, I go to these and to me, these are actually pretty decent. That's how easy going I am.  But here I am writing a complaint about Mariko Japanese restaurant... at this point you can be sure this must have been the worst restaurant I have been to in the past decade by my already super low standards to compel me to write this negative review. I wish there was a way to give a 0 star rating, because even a one start rating is too much dignity for this filthy place.  I took my friend here on a Sunday afternoon, and we had the AYCE menu. They sat us down on filthy sticky tables. 15 minutes later someone came to take our order. At this point we asked our tables to be cleaned. We gave up asking for napkins. The first set of order started trickling in... after 30 minutes. To summarize it was disgusting. But hey, I could live with that. I can eat and put up with disgusting food. What was the real slap in the face was the service. The restaurant was empty, but each order took close to 30 minutes to arrive. And when it arrived, half of our orders were missing. Literally out of every 3 different food items we ordered, only one would arrive, and then only after multiple orders. I kept reordering the same thing half dozen times, each time hopelessly, knowing it will never arrive.  The table next to us were three friends ordering AYCE as well. When they saw us making an order, they asked me ``are you actually ordering again?\" I said yes. The other guy said, \"wow, really? this is the most disgusting food we have ever had\".... well, actually, I am ordering again because our order placed an hour ago never arrived, and we are starving and we are paying the full AYCE price anyways.  At the end, after having been and waiting there for over an hour, when we wanted to order again (we were still hungry), we decided against it. We paid, and left without leaving a penny for tip... yes, we left a buffet restaurant still hungry, and went home to fill ourselves up with the crap left in my own fridge. I never thought that was possible.   STAY AWAY. If hell had a japanese restaurant, this would be it."}
{"text":"It tasted so bad, we got the bento box and the tempura was under-cooked, The beef was rough. The sushi was huge and fell apart when you pick it up."}
{"text":"I love this AYCE and even for takeout, I go out of my way to come to Mariko because the rolls are big and the sushi is fresh. But yes, this is an affordable AYCE sushi spot with good customer service--they're pretty sweet and smile and work hard. Like the menu too, and the convenient location."}
{"text":"I come here all the time for a few reasons. The price point is great, especially for a starving student like myself. There are two AYCE menus to choose from. One of them is $10.99 all day and has about 75 items. The other is $14.99 and has over 100 items. To me, most random sushi places on yonge are all pretty similar, with average sushi. This place is no different, but it has the biggest and cheapest menu I've seen thus far, so therefore it is my favourite. I LOVE sushi and am not a picky eater, so this place is just fine for me!! Would I go back? I'm pretty sure they know me by name! Lol. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Damn if I could give this place NO star at all then i would!! Stumble upon this place feeling very hungry. Sat down right away it was quite busy for 8pm on a Sunday. Was seated in the booths they had and the table were DIRTY and sticky! I asked the waitress to wipe it clean but i dont think it helped because the cloth was dirty as well. Wished i left right there and then!  We asked for the AYCE menu ($15.99) because it had more items to chose from.  I ordered salmon sashimi and white tuna sashimi and Dynamite roll  when they arrived i was surprise. The sashimi was sliced into chunks! The white tuna sashimi was terrible!! It smelled bad and tasted even worst. After eating the white tuna my stomach felt weird. Complaint to the waitress and she said that the tuna is freshly cut and if i want to have another one the chef will cut me one. Ah...NO THANKS!! Their Dynamite roll was JUST bad.  Holding it with my chopsticks and it  all fell apart!    After 6 pieces of sushi. Paid the bill and left ASAP!!   NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"I didn't realize you could hate your job so much.  The servers here look like they want to die.  but kill you first.  and then die. The food is just really subpar in an already bad town for sushi experiences. The seaweed salad was frozen.  FROZEN and they just nuked that baby and said sorry...I spose there's nothing else they could have done if all their salad is frozen. The rolls are filled to the brim with tempura bits and imo that's just a waste.  Disgusting filler. The agedashi tofu was fried in old oil. Nasty. Don't bother.   Damn -30 degree weather makes me go to the closest place available.    gross."}
{"text":"Defiantly going to miss my favourite sushi place. $16.99 dollars for all you can eat menu. Sadly I have to find a new sushi place."}
{"text":"This is literally the WORST restaurant experience my boyfriend and I have ever, EVER had. I cannot find the words to express how terrible this place is. If I could give less than one star, I would.   Somehow, even the miso soup is awful... the cups tasted like soap but still seemed unclean, and the bowls had little flecks of paint chipping off. The rice was bordering on crunchy, the \"spicy salmon rolls\" looked like dog food smothered in a pinkish hot mayo, wrapped loosely in what I guess was supposed to be a roll.   After realizing that the rolls were horrendous, we thought we would stick to kitchen items. This was no safer; I bit into the \"sweet and sour chicken\" to find it was almost entirely raw on the inside.  We tried to wash everything down with plentiful amounts of water from our soapy, dingy cups, but the server ignored us entirely and did not refill our cups. We were one of two couples in the place, and yet we were entirely ignored for most of our time there.   When my boyfriend went to pay, he saw the cook sleeping in a booth...."}
{"text":"Usually when reviewing Toronto sushi places I talk about how the food was bad but the service was amazing. Today it's going to be switched up a little. The food here was ok. Got a bento for $9.95. Three kinds of maki, all rolled properly, well seasoned rice, avocado and salmon were fresh. Miso soup was very savoury. Salad dressing was awesomely tart. Chicken teriyaki was fine. Spring roll was fine. Tofu was superb. Mountain of food for a low price. Only downside was that the tempura was horrendous. It was soggy.   When I walked it in took three minutes to be noticed, greeted, and seated. There were two servers and only four occupied tables (and they were standing about, not at the tables). There's no excuse. The menu is huge so a couple minutes later I'm still holding it in front of my face reading it and a server comes and says \"Are you ready yet?\" and I suppressed a \"Yes, I'm just reading now for the entertainment value\". I order and it takes too long to get to me. While waiting I notice there is a dinner ayce menu which was never offered to me. Oh well, not too hungry anyway, but would have been nice to be told about it. When she brings my food my water is empty. She looks at glass. Doesn't fill it. Ten minutes later she walks by, glass is empty, looks at it, doesn't fill it. Third time she walks by I ask. She still doesn't fill it. Five minutes later another server fills it. I must have tired out the girl by asking her for water because she disappeared but more on that later. As I eat I notice the floor is disgusting. Chopstick here, lump of rice there, no effort to do anything about it. I also notice the server that didn't disappear is just chilling up front drinking a bubble tea instead of working. I finish the food. Server walks by. \"Are you done?\" I say yup. \"Can I get you anything else?\" I say no. Wait 20 minutes, never see a bill. Get up and approach her. As I do I find server #1 sprawled out in a booth taking an effing nap! Can you imagine? Server two says \"Do you want to pay?\" and I suppress a \"No, I'd just thought I'd do laps of the place to work off the bento\". She starts looking at the menu and mumbling to herself. I don't have time for it. Drop 11.25 on the counter and walk out. No tip for the first time in my life. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Had dinner with some friends at Mariko tonight, it was.. ok.. certainly nothing special...  +ve's:  -even though the place was reasonably busy, the service was quick. -inexpensive  comments (not really -ve's, but close): - edamame and anything sweet for desert are a la cart and not included with the AYCE - kinda odd  -Water was brought to the table and we were never asked if we wanted anything else.  I certainly would have expected tea rather than water.  The refilling of the water glasses was labored at best.  -The sushi, sashimi, tempura, udon were all ok. The fish seemed a bit on the old side - kinda soft and mushy - maybe it'd been frozen? dunno.  The udon broth was kinda tasteless.  The tempura was not bad, but a little greasy - same was true for the gyoza, not bad, but a bit greasy."}
{"text":"The red snapper shashimi was soggy and mashed up. The waiter could barely comprehend what I wanted to order. She looked half asleep. I was ordering takeout and I asked for a fork with my garden salad. She predictably forgot. It was difficult just paying for the order--as she seemed so distracted and wasn't on hand to take my cash.   My verdict: Mediocre food, poor service"}
{"text":"This is the WORST SUSHI IN TOWN. DO NOT GO. Popped in before a movie which is the only reason it does any business I am guessing from reviews below. YIKES! I was in a hurry for a take-out order. TWO of us got SICK with BAD STOMACHS for two days! The place is FILTHY, starting with the front door, fingerprints, and dirty floors. A very bad sign. The first thing I clocked inside were the Chinese (nothing Japanese here) employees and owners' SHOES thrown on the floor in front of the 'sushi bar!' Only one couple in the restaurant. Mops are visible, brooms, and crap surrounds the food area. The first banquet is totally covered full with papers and plastic bags, there are filthy chairs that need to be tossed they are so dirty dirty dirty. The staff who wore dirty tops barely understood my order, and though the prices are good, the food made ever so slowly by a tired elderly Chinese gentleman (who looked as though he should have his feet up in front of TV not working) was the worst I have ever had. IGNORE any reviews that like this place, those are not people with any food standards whatsoever. FEH!"}
{"text":"The first time I walked in to Mariko, I sat at a table waiting for almost 15 minutes for someone to take my order before choosing to just leave. It wasn't busy, almost empty really, and servers could be seen chatting amongst themselves.  I should have heeded that warning.  Before Mariko, I wouldn't have believed that sushi could be made and served so poorly. The rolls were mostly rice, falling apart from poor construction, actually lukewarm, and the fish (what there was of it) was definitely not fresh. The \"spicy sauce\" that covered some options seemed to be little more than a greasy spiced mayonnaise-like goop that I might expect to see at a roadside Denny's.   A server dressed in dirty sweatpants? Dust-covered exposed wiring tangled around the tawdry lighting fixtures?   Never again."}
{"text":"I've been here three times hoping that this place would change my way I think of it, but it doesn't seem to please...The place is way too small, the choices are not up to par like some of the sushi places I've been to in and around the downtown core.  Staff is friendly, but at times hard to get their attention when you're trying to order... Though its a cheap eat, sometimes its just not worth it...."}
{"text":"This place used to be really good before they renovated the location. However, the last time I went back to this place in September, the sushi rolls were basically the size of a coke can with an extremely big overload of rice. I would actually consider it a rice ball more than sushi. We had ayce but all we ended up getting were the rolls first and by the time we got through the rolls we had no more space for the sashimi. Bottom line, they tried to fill us up with rice so that we would eat less of the sashimi or other food on the menu (cheaper for them). This place for sure will run out of business if they keep this up. Even the lady serving us felt bad and understood when we wanted her to take away the remaining of the rice clumps."}
{"text":"My buddy, Eric, and I come here for lunch pretty much every Tuesday and order one of their lunch specials.  They are an unbelievable deal.  For example, for just $5.25, you receive miso soup and a bento box with chicken teriyaki, rice, salad, 4 California rolls and two tofu cubes (somewhat sauteed).  Hey, you also get a bottomless cup of green tea.   We've been alternating restaurants in the Annex area for years but this has been the most popular for us.  Healthy and a terrific deal.  Can't beat this place.  And, after all these years, the staff knows us so it's kind of like walking into Cheers for us.  \"Norm!\""}
{"text":"Yeah this place pretty much uses pretty poor quality of fish and small cuts. We did not order the all you can eat either. This is what happens when instant gratification and starvation are mixed."}
{"text":"Mariko is your cookie cutter Bathurst/Queen street OAR (Other Asian Run) Japanese sushi joint, in the mode of Sushi on Bloor, Sushi Time, and the long dead grand papasan of 'em all the Sushi Bistro.   The all-you-can-eat deal isn't so bad. For the price of your basic makimono type set (salad, miso soup, 1 california roll, 1 tuna roll, 1 salmon roll) you can order off a little menu \"tick sheet\". This isn't Nami (is that place still open?) or Fune (is that place still open?) quality sushi but it's a sight better than Mandarin sushi (or even Todai... should Toronto ever get the amazing Todai buffet).   If you're not familiar with the all you can eat system in many Japanese restaurants, you don't belly up to a steam table. You get a little menu, write down how many of each items you wish, and then the waitress scurries off and brings 70% of what you ordered. If you want more, you can get another tick sheet and repeat the process. Don't go hog wild. Pace yourself. There are plenty of fish in the fish farms down in Chile. Mariko frowns on waste and make various threats to charge you for uneaten items. Also, many of the rolls are pretty heapin' big. So order a couple per diner and then go from there.  The salmon sashimi is pretty good and I'm always tempted to write \"74\" next to the salmon sashimi entry on the tick sheet. But then I get visions of Motel Hell (IMDB it!) and angering someone behind the counter with a knife much sharper than mine.   The salmon roll had a bit of a zing. I did order the salmon roll and I noticed there was a spicy salmon roll. Not sure if they got the order mixed up. If the order was right, it makes me wonder what the spicy salmon roll is like. Oish.  In the photo, I posted you'll see the white tuna roll and the red snapper sashimi. That was my second go.  The red snapper, not so fussy. The white tuna, well, I had better at this amazing kaitan sushi hole-in-the-wall in Osaka. But then it didn't have that \"still frozen\" mouth feel you seem to get at Korean sushi joints in Seoul."}
{"text":"I had an okay lunch today, but the fish was a bit slimy and I was worried that I might suffer some intense repercussions, and my chicken teryaki was pretty cold. Also not a great sign. It's priced about the same as many cheaper sushi places in the city, but I don't think it was worth what I paid."}
{"text":"After watching a great Hot Doc, my fiance and I were hungry and saw this place directly across the street.  We went with the more expensive AYCE menu.  Service wasn't so good.  Our waitress barely spoke english and was not very attentive.  Never noticed even a smile out of her.  We were seated near the front of the restaurant and felt a draft everytime the door was opened (also, there was a piercing squeak noise that happened everytime the door was pushed open all the way).   Now onto the food...sushi was so so with too much rice used.  Most of the had a pickled taste to it.....not sure what it was nor do I want to know now.  Sashimi was sub par.  Grilled meat tasted a little grisly and wasn't cooked enough.  I guess you pay for what you get and I should have walked further down the street t an a la carte sushi place.  I will not go back to this place..."}
{"text":"The $5.25 lunch deal tastes like it's worth $2.00.  It's edible, but it's probably the worst Japanese food you can find in the city.  (What!  There's a second location?!)"}
{"text":"I wish we had looked at the Yelp reviews earlier but with no phone on us we just walked in, baited by the $16.99 AYCE price.   My boyfriend wanted to celebrate a win by taking me to AYCE and we decided to finally cross off Mariko on our AYCE hit-list. For $16.99 all-you-can-eat, we didn't have any high expectations of the food quality. We just wanted to be full and be merry.  Food was average-below average but enough to satisfy. Tempura was never crispy (and if you think that's an undercooked yam tempura, no, it's just carrot.) The salmon sashimi was probably the only highlight of our night, though they were poorly deboned.  But oh, did we wait... I think we came in at 9:30PM and our first order didn't come in until 10:20ish. There were only three other tables. It was like this with all our orders until closing time. I guess on the bright side, we finally paced ourselves at AYCE and there were a set of flies that entertained us as we tried to keep them off of our chopsticks.  Service though? Really bad. Like, I don't think I've ever been this baffled by service in my life especially since my entire family (also Chinese) works in the restaurant scene. To start off, we were handed two sheets for AYCE but no pen/pencil. No plates for anything until we asked for them during our second order. Water has no ice and was lukewarm. I would not be surprised if it was like those restaurant stories my parents tell of places that rinse utensils in drinking water. Ha..  Communicating with the staff is terrible. They're always in a rush (to not serve the other customers) and were really condescending. I always like to give people the benefit of the doubt especially if English is not they're first language when it comes to tone (since I understand this issue having interacted with so many ESL Chinese) but no... the staff is just plain grumpy 24/7.   We were charged an extra ~$4 due to some miscommunication and after waiting for our waitress's 20 minute phone call to end, we flagged her down. We disputed this charge but instead of rectifying this issue (sounds familiar to some other yelp reviews?!) they asked why we even bothered coming here instead of the other AYCEs on Bloor. W-what? We were willing to pay the extra charge since it was a misunderstanding on both ends and it was only $4 but the immediate lashing out that occurred from wanting to get the situation clarified was downright unnecessary. They eventually removed the charge and we even *tipped* them (something I will regret to this day.) I was even more put off by how fiercely the waitress grabbed the money off of the table sans the tray by slamming her palm down on the bills and then clenching them in a fist while I was in the middle of exiting the booth..  To those that still want to try Mariko's AYCE for their first time and to those that will unknowingly walk in like we did, stay safe."}
{"text":"So me and my girlfriend wanted to eat some sushi and we went here to give it a try and to me it's was pretty crappy.. Their sushi rolls are bad because the seaweed and the rice are old. Not worth the money at all. They're getting 2 stars because the staff are nice and if you order more than $8 you get a choice of 3 pieces of dumplings or sushi."}
{"text":"Some say ignorance is bliss, but missing out on all-you-can-eat sushi would be a shame.  I agree with what's already been written here: this place isn't about gourmet sushi or stellar service, but it's a relatively risk-free opportunity to try different types of maki and leave satisfied. I went here with a friend and ordered a variety of rolls, which were all made quite simply - my friend warned me that the rolls generally include one item only, which means the rolls here are quite small. Everything seemed fresh and the quality met my minimum requirements.  The service is okay - I had to remind one of the servers to bring one of our menu items.  But the rest of our order was filled quickly and the wait staff seemed to be on top of things. Overall, however, I left satisfied and I'd probably go back to try something different :)"}
{"text":"I've visited Mariko on Bloor (near Bathurst) twice now, and was surprised to see it wasn't listed on Yelp yet.  My first visit to this location was initiated by their signage.  They always seem to have some sort of special on, which is great for students.  They have a $10.99 AYCE menu (albeit VERY limited), and a $14.99 AYCE which includes sashimi (2 or 3 types).  They also have \"FREE DAYS\", where each day of the week, you get something free with your meal (ie. tofu & miso on Sundays).  Both times I have been there, service has been brutal.  There were times that the waitress was just sitting at a table with her head down, and one of the chefs would come over to serve us after our failed attempts to get her attention.  The first visit, I ordered à la carte, and the food came out beautifully prepared and displayed.  (see picture I will be uploading) The second visit, which was AYCE, it was as though they couldn't care less.  It was all just laid on a big plate in rows.  The salmon sashimi came out in super thin slices, yet all still stuck together by some fatty tissue at the corner.  I have never seen sashimi cut so poorly in my life!  And the fish just did not seem like sushi grade.  I was so disgusted, I didn't re-order anything but basic rolls.  But even the spicy salmon roll was purely mushy, and it appeared that the chef hadn't cleaned his prep area between preparing rolls.  Rolls that weren't supposed to have fish eggs on them had a few scattered bits of tobiko around the outside, that clearly didn't come from just being on the plate.  It's so important for sushi chefs to use clean surfaces when preparing different rolls or fish.   For a second time, I was disgusted.  The interior is a cold blue, and the lighting is just as unwelcoming.  I think they've installed fluorescent lighting panels on the walls, and put transparent images of bamboo over them, as if they could act as sconces.  FAIL  We overheard a diner behind us asking the waitress to recommend something delicious he hadn't tried before, and she suggested the dynamite roll.  I couldn't believe it.  The customer looked pretty disappointed too.  If I had to rank the million sushi places on Bloor, Mariko would be wayyy down on my list.  If you're going to try it, my only advice is not to go for the AYCE.  It's just not worth it in the end if you can't enjoy your meal.  Part of the joy of sushi is the presentation and preparation.  It should be a feast for the eyes as well, and Mariko seems to think that it's alright to offer an inferior meal to their AYCE customers.  Later found out they had a conditional pass back in April '09.  See here for details:  http://app.toronto.ca/food2/DineSafeMain?userRequest=view_history&ESTABLISHMENT_ID=10186766"}
{"text":"Had the AYCE once. Wasn't bad, but not awesome either. Can find better for the price, but maybe not around.  Today I tried the chicken Katsudon, and once again flavor was fit for the price (bowl wasn't small, so you get some value)."}
{"text":"I personally LOVE Mariko and have been going there for years. The sashimi is always top notch and the service is usually pretty good. It has been most times I have been there. They offer two all you can eat menus that are very reasonably priced and have a decent variety as well."}
{"text":"Mariko is a sushi joint located near Yonge-Dundas square. Other than it being located on some prime real estate, there isn't much to admire about this place. This is a pretty well priced all-you-can-eat restaurant so if you came here expecting fresh fish flown from Tokyo or Kobe beef, you are a fool for walking through Mariko's doors.   I ate at Mariko a total of 3 times. The first time I ate at Mariko was on a friend's birthday. It was a fairly large group and we were able to take up the front half of the restaurant. I was not in charge of ordering and I was too occupied with talking with old friends so the food was an after thought. The second time, I went there pretty hammered from a bar trip earlier on that day. That time I also was there for the fact I was just chilling with friends and the food again was an after thought. The last time I went to Mariko was the first time I did realize what kind of place was it.  I went there with a friend hoping to get my sushi craving killed. We received a little paper which we wrote what we want and what quantity. The first problem I noticed is that the service was pretty poor. We had to wait very long for some sashimi and maki rolls in a restuarant which had only 2 other tables being served. When the food finally did come, I was less than impressed. I did know not to put my standards high on a place that is offering all you can eat but the sushi rice tasted very bland and the white fish sashimi was not fresh at all. The salmon sashimi did taste really good and my friend and I smartened up and decided to only order salmon sashimi( WARNING: Eating too much raw salmon really hits the stomach hard). Also, the cooked items on the menu were hit or miss. The miso soup tasted nice but the tempura and other fried dishes looked like they came from the frozen food section to be microwave cooked.   All in all, Mariko has okay food and less than impressive service. I have a feeling I will be back but I have a feeling I will be drunk when that time happens."}
{"text":"Complete shite AYCE.  Yes, it's cheap. But it's freaking awful.   I was taken here on a really bad date (first & last) once.  The rolls look like they were made by a blindfolded 8 year old cutting with a hacksaw. They come out mostly rice with one tiny slice of rotten avocado or cucumber as an afterthought, doused in that sickingly sweet glaze sauce that makes everything taste better.  The decor is cheap and dated. I can't rememer if the service was horrible or not, so it was probably adequate.  There's cheap and then there's Mariko cheap. Don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"The Good:  There are two options for AYCE. So, for people who only like Veg, Chicken, or Beef in their rolls and no fish you don't have to pay full pop.  The decor is in keeping with the nicer sushi restaurants in the area.  The Bad:  Way too much rice on the sushi. I know there is supposed to be rice on sushi, I'm not freaking out over carbs. This was out of hand. There was hardly any fish in the rolls! Where are the nice big chunks of salmon and tuna?   The rolls were not well assembled. some where falling apart when picked up with chop sticks - the sign of a poorly trained (if at all) sushi chef.   We like to order a lot of sashimi. The first round of salmon sashimi was excellent. The second round was clearly cut the tail end of the fish were there is more marbling and fat. This cut of salmon is not normally for sushi. It's creamier consistency is better for some rolls, but not sashimi.   The severs were nice, but very difficult to communicate with. This is pretty typical for a lot of sushi restaurants in the area.   The Ugly:  When you're given a menu and pen/pencil to fill it out, a 4cm pencil covered in black gunk is not what you want when you're ordering food.   It took forever for our first order to arrive! I'm not expecting fast food, but at least bring out the first roll or two within 15 minutes.   ***The lesson here: you get what you pay for. *** This place is about 30% cheaper than other AYCE sushi restaurants in the area, and the quality of the food is at least 30% lower. I like quantity when it comes to sushi, but quality counts for so much more."}
{"text":"THEY RIP ME OFF, I wrote 61.60 as my total on visa but they charge me 64.60. I did reduce the amount on the tip (I only pay 4 dollars) due to the poor service they provided. BEWARE OF VISA FRUAD!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"There are plenty of questions that humans will ponder over long periods of time to try to find an answer to. What is life? Are we alone in the universe? How is Mariko still in business? We may never find out the answer to that last one, but let's try to wrap our heads around it for the time being.   Sure, it may be relatively cheap for an AYCE, but starving to death is also cheap. At least with the latter you can die a dignified death and not have your hippocampus tarnished with the memory of ever coming to this place. With poor service, a menu with text printed in the smallest size font in faded red (ask the staff for a magnifying glass if you don't have your electron microscope handy), low quality fish, and a whopping 7 conditional passes from Dinesafe(!) under its belt, it truly is a wonder how this place is still around. Considering the rising presence of Japanese food in the area, such an environment should've put this place out of its misery ages ago.   For those that have already made the mistake of coming here at some point, especially if it is your first AYCE experience, I am sorry. For those that have not been here, run. Run as fast as you can."}
{"text":"I was in the neighbourhood to see a documentary and this place was literally across the street. Convenience won the day.  It was only after I sat down that I checked Yelp. Based on the reviews I was totally expecting a shitstorm the entire time, but alas, no horrifically crappy service or explosive diarrhea to speak of.   Granted, I had a lunch combo and can't speak for the AYCE situation.   The service was good, the food was decent. They could've given me more rice though...I was trying to hit my macros jeez.   And wondering whether they still serve salad with their hands? Ignorance is bliss."}
