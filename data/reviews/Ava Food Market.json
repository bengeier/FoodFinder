{"text":"So many kinds of flavored waters for baking. ^_^ And I need to step up my baklava making game because it's the best baklava I ever had!  WARNING the parking lot is epicly small and diagonal. Try and take the metro there if you can,"}
{"text":"I go to this place almost every week. The price and quality are amazing. You can get various kinds of kabobs with a coke for about  8$ which is impressive. I also really like their Persian style beryani. I think this is the only place I know that have Persian beryani. They also have various kinds of pickles that worth giving a shot. Overall, a great place."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place on a few occasions and today was the day I decided to just go for it.  I was looking for kashke bademjan (eggplant dip) but they didn't have it.  I asked for adas polo (lentil rice) and they didn't have that either.  What to do?...   Ask for the specials!  I tried a soup, a chicken stew, fish on rice, and also bought a giant flatbread.  Not bad, but no standouts either.  There are several meal plates on the menu.  I'm gonna come back again to try some other dishes.  I think it's a quick and easy choice if you're in the area.  If you go further north on Yonge towards Steeles, there is definitely more selection for Persian delicacies."}
{"text":"I liked the takeout food bar at the back of this supermarket. Unfortunately most of the selection were in Persian so I stuck to items (kebab and lamb) that I recognized and felt safe with. There is also a small pastry section. The staff are really friendly and patiently answered all my questions. Definitely check this place out if you want to try some authentic Persian food!"}
{"text":"20+ minute wait for a fast food sandwich from a grocery store is ridiculous. The staff is rude and wouldn't give me an estimate of the wait time straight away, saying \"there are lots of orders\" without giving specific information."}
{"text":"Addicted to the hot food served here. It's take-out but they do have some seating for diners. While they prepare your fresh hot kabab you can go around and pick out some nuts, dates, breads, spices, cheeses, desserts, canned goods, teas, honey, a few fresh produce items, etc. A lot is packed into this tiny, clean, charming grocery store. The prices are reasonable and parking is free. I like how welcoming the servers are. They are from Iran but yesterday the man running the place wore a Canada ball-cap and seemed genuinely pleased to see our Canadian family coming in to enjoy their food."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going here for a few years now.  Tried many other Persian restaurants of course, although all good but Kubideh in here is something else.  Always hot and fresh made with different kind of spices (advieh) which makes it very tasty compare to all other places.    Friendly and helpful staff, very reasonable prices ($8.99+tax) includes a drink!   Lots of other goodies in store.... you gotta try the zaffarani ice cream (with or without waffles)"}
{"text":"How does a lamb shank dinner for $9.99 sound? Doesn't the fact that it comes with a pop make it that much better?  Ava Food Market has a little Persian food hot counter setup going in the back of their market. I knew they did, because I saw their hot plate combos advertised outside. I just struggled to find it when I got into the market. That's okay. It was worth it. I've been on a bit of a Korean food kick for the last year and a half or so, but when I'm not craving Korean food, I'm craving Persian food. I came to this plaza with the intent of going to Sushi House next door, but I got sidetracked when I saw this place. Koobideh kebab and rice (and salad) for $7.99. Lamb shank dinner with rice (and salad) for $9.99. Koobideh on a pita (with salad) for $4.95. I had to check it out.   Ended up getting both the koobideh kebab and rice, and the lamb shank and rice to go. Was a bit confusing, because where I ordered and where I was supposed to pay were two different places. It's okay. It all worked out fine. The koobideh was grilled to order. 2 kebabs in one order. Served with a charred tomato over rice (either dill rice or plain rice). I got dill. I love dill rice. The koobideh is one of the more flavorful koobideh's I've had. I'm impressed. Technically, I didn't need to buy anything this time because I had ordered food next door before coming, but I caved and got the lamb shank as well. Fairly large lamb shank. One of the largest I've seen in a lamb shank dinner anywhere. Also served with dill rice, mounds of dill rice. So much dill rice. Mmmm. Dill rice. The lamb is flavorful. Could be slightly more tender, but for that price, I'm definitely not complaining. I'm also having it slightly cold, so that might have something to do with it.  (This place loses one star because the meals were supposed to come with salad, but neither did. Oh well. Still a solid, cheap meal, even without the salad.)  All in all, a great place to go to grab a cheap meal.  Side note, there are a few seats available if you want to eat in."}
{"text":"I was looking for a different place to eat, different, non chain, I don't live in T.O. but I was in the neighbourhood and needed something. I love Persian food, and found this place, it did not disappoint. Very nice people, around 25 items on their menu, all up on the wall in big letters, $4.99 to $24.99. From chicken and rice to lamb shank to beef stew. All look good, only so much stomach room to try things. I settled on a beef stew, it came with rice and a drink. $7.99. More than enough food, go with a friend and share two dishes or try stuff and take it away. They have a little eating area, free but precarious parking, stew had plenty of meat, spinach and beans, typical Persian stew. More than good, not blow my socks off amazing but I would go back in a heart beat.  I didn't explore the grocery store but it looked like it had all the basic middle eastern goods."}
{"text":"Small Persian grocery store that has a hot table in the back.   Ordered the koobideh kebab which is a delicious blend of minced beef and lamb with herbs roasted over charcoal and served on a bed of rice with saffron.   Fresh koobideh is one of the best foods out there. The meat is super tender and juicy while the putter portion is a little crispy from the flames.   This place makes a mean koobideh. It not only tasted great but the meat and other ingredients were super fresh and tasty.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have become a regular visitor to Ava Food market since I moved to the Yonge and Leslie area, I come her mostly for the restaurant at the back - fabulous!! My partner is Persian so i've become an avid middle eastern food lover and this place has some of the best pertain food!  I highly recommend the Ghemieh - my favourite or any of their kebabs. The ghormeh sabziz isn't the best however. The staff are really friendly and happy to help me out when i'm wandering around looking confused (often)."}
{"text":"Our Iranian neighbour recommended this charming little grocery and food take out place.  The food is really good, especially the kebabs, and prices are very reasonable.  They have a fascinating selection of Persian groceries - we picked up some interesting sour onion pickles and excellent quince jam.  Lots of spices and herbs at good prices.  On top of everything the staff are very nice and helpful people."}
{"text":"I'm not Iranian I just point to the photo of the food I like. And the food is very good.   Service is very slow. Like very very slow. But I love their beef and chicken and rice. If I have time to wait, I enjoy getting take out here."}
{"text":"Always consistent! The beef kebabs are really the star here. Always perfectly grilled and packed with flavor. This may just be a counter in a small Persian grocery store in a random strip mall, but the food is stellar. Service is always kind and friendly!"}
{"text":"The service was good. The girl serving  was friendly and polite. The food was ok. The dill rice was a bit dry and so was the koobideh. It looked as if a lot of their rice was left  over and not fresh"}
{"text":"This place is a gem for great Iranian food. Inside the grocery store they serve takeout. There are a few seats in the store where you can sit and eat.  The staff is really friendly and will answer all your questions in regards to the food.  I have had the chicken and beef skewers. The chicken was juicy and full of flavour. I was given a lot of the saffron rice which was more than enough for one person. The grilled tomatoe had a smokey flavour which I enjoyed. The only thing that I did not like was the waiting time which was over 15 mins for take out. The price is reasonable and I will go back to try other items on the menu!"}
