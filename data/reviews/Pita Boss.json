{"text":"I love a good shawarma. when done properly, it totally invokes food stalls in Istanbul or Syria. however, this place does not deliver at all.  The shawarma tasted like bread and sauce. and the sauce wasnt that great.  The meat was totally unknown. my wife and I kept debating if what little chunks were chicken or beef. we slept not knowing which it was.  much better places around the area for a shawarma or pita. avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"i love pita boss. the portion is so generous, with more chicken i get at other places. the chicken has excellent flavour and is moist, and the veggies taste fresh. the shawarma is put on a grill with delicious marinade to crisp it up. it comes with enough sauce that you dont need extra. we have been twice since discovering, and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"the owner of this establishment sucks!!! This guy always closes early and locks the door. The sign says it closes at 9 pm, but don't even bother going past 8:20pm because this guy would rather go home early then to make money.Good business you're running bud. I'll be surprised your business is still there in a few months because turning away customers won't get you far."}
{"text":"The best Shawarma in the GTA! Especially since it's grilled/toasted for a crispy factor. Super fresh, made to order, and delicious. Try the Final Boss - love the pineapple. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Best shawarma place in Mississauga by far."}
{"text":"As a shawarma fan, I have to say this is one of the best I've had. The chicken is freshly cut off the spit to order so it's not sitting around. The shawarma is grilled after its put together. Do yourself a favour and try this place."}
{"text":"Really good food. Me and my family come here often and never get disappointed with the great food and service. There are many places around us but we keep coming back to Pita Boss simply because of the great food and customer service. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Best chicken shawarma in town!! They even put rice in my shawarma! Best service as well! I'm super impressed. The atmosphere is so welcoming and it smells so good right when you walk in. The shawarma is super crispy and they sprinkle it garlic powder!"}
{"text":"Felt compelled to write a follow up review after tonights disappointing dining experience. The past handful of times here have displayed a steep decline in the quality of their dishes. Not only have their sauces and seasonings been altered dramatically, but their overall unique recipes have become bland and very run-of-the-mill. Probably wont be returning at this rate - very upsetting :("}
{"text":"The shawarma was huge and toasted to a crisp, which I find rare these days but definitely give it up to them for that. However, I don't think I've ever had a chicken shawarma as salty as that ever, which basically ruined the shawarma overall :'("}
{"text":"Closed. Osmow's replaced it.   At the very least Lazeez is still a viable second option. But Pita boss had amazing food."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I have a long time love for shawarma. We are shawarma snobs. We've tried it everywhere - including NYC, and we still think Mississauga has the best shawarma we've ever had. Because a lot of shawarma places...all over the city, including Toronto...FUCKING SUCK. They lack seasoning and flavour. WTF is the point of calling it shawarma? Call it BLAND-AS-FUCK-CHICKEN-WRAP-WITH-SOME-QUESTIONABLE-GARLIC-SAUCE and call it a day. But do NOT call it shawarma. FOR SHAME.  My Shawarma-Partner-in-Crime, and another good friend and I were all out together, starving after spending a whole day moving. My SPiC moved to Meadowvale and suggested Pita Boss. Me: \"But is it as good as so-and-so place!?\" SPiC said: \"It's..........different\". Oh, I like this already!  When we walked in, we were greeted by the smell of...a BBQ grill?! It smelled deliciously smokey in there, and I was very surprised by an all wood.....bar? WHAT IS THIS PLACE.  I hadn't been feeling well all day, but my appetite had come back, and I was famished. I ordered a chicken shawarma dinner.  LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.  THIS HOT SAUCE? Is earthy, rich and hot. It has great heat without overpowering the flavours present. I could faintly taste tomato? This is one of the most unusual hot sauces I've ever had at a shawarma place, and I mean that in the best way possible. This hot sauce is OUTSTANDING. You guys seriously have to sell it!  The hot sauce was a beautiful contrast to the creamy white sauce. Rice was perfectly cooked and extremely flavourful. The chicken shawarma itself was moist, tender, very well-seasoned, and downright fucking DELICIOUS. I was extremely full and sadly left a few bites behind. But not because I wanted to!   The service was excellent and as the chef passed by to check in on us, stuffing our faces, I was too full of food to answer verbally, but I did raise two very enthusiastic thumbs up. He laughed!  I will visit Meadowvale just for Pita Boss!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat!! Service was great and tasted great. Would recommend the chicken shawarma. Will be coming back. The smell when you walk through the door is a pleasure."}
{"text":"Excited about this place and hope that it will keep up it's quality. I've had the chicken shawarma wrap a few times here now and so far it has not disappointed. The chicken is not dry and flavourful. The vegetables are a decent amount as not to over power the chicken. I appreciate that they don't overload the shwarmas with lettuce. Also love how the shwarma is toasted just the perfect amount. I really like the crunch/bite of the pita with the tender juicy chicken and sauces inside. Delicious! My friends had shwarma on the rocks she said she didn't like it too much but she said she would definitley vouch for the shwarma wrap. I brought the souvlaki dinner home for my mom and she really liked it. Said the rice wasn't too greasy like lazeez and not too salty. Although I don't love the fact that they sell Greek food at a shwarma place, they do a pretty good job making it.   The place is definitely nice and clean enough to \"dine in\". Not a hole in the wall like osmows but not a lot of space for seating like lazeez. The interior and vibe is definitely better than any shwarma joint in mississauga."}
{"text":"I have tried the Chicken shawarma salad and the chicken shawarma dinner. Both are phenomenal with care and attention to taste and detail. You'd never know it to walk in but it has THE best food in mississauga Quality homemade and authentic taste"}
{"text":"Actually a 4.5 stars. Got the chicken shawarma sandwich. Wanted the Shawarma and Rice but they were out of potatoes and rice an hour early...  The first thing I noticed when we got our sandwiches were the portions. It was above average imo, especially for the price you pay ($6.99 I believe). Next was the quality of the food... And this is where I would give it the most praise! It was absolutely fantastic and delicious. I enjoyed the meat (chicken - it was tender) and the veges tasted fresh and the pita bread was toasted perfectly. The sauces that they use are also delicious - I would recommend having it with the habanero sauce they have at the tables as that adds a little more kick to it.   Overall, one of the best shawarmas I have eaten in the Toronto area. Worth the price and worth the drive up to Mississauga if you love shawarma! I would definitely recommend this to friends."}
{"text":"No black pepper on their rice today, sauce still too sour though. Maybe ill tell them to hold the sauce next time."}
{"text":"3.5 Rating  I used to work very near here for a couple years, and never tried it during that time. I was back in the area again, and was craving shawarma. Was I missing anything all these years?  'On the rocks' seems to be the big thing the last couple years. It's not my absolute favourite, but sometimes I like to go for it. I asked if they could throw tomatoes on it, and the owner asked if I'd like them cooked into the rice as it was being heated. It was a nice gesture and turned out to work out quite well.  I love rice at Middle Eastern places with there's extra touches to it, such as lentils and fried onions (i.e. Lazeez). Here the rice was just plain. The chicken was pretty good, but nothing exceptional. I really liked the hot sauce. It was the perfect heat for me, so they could put a good amount on - giving me the great taste, and not making it OTT spicy. The garlic sauce was the weak point however, being far too much like Miracle Whip for my tastes.  An okay option in the area. That said, I think I saw a sign with Lazeez opening soon at a spot a few blocks up the road. They may want to find ways to bring a bit more flavour if they want to thrive in a increasingly competitive market."}
{"text":"First place I've has a Chicken Shawarma...I'm an \"On the Rocks\" guy personally. The shawarma was Fantastic and a great size too!   The Rocks was just as good. Great amount rice on the bottom, the chicken was chunky and very flavourful, fattier tasting than other chicken shawarma  but It made it taste all the better"}
{"text":"I have tried osmows and loved it  for years. Then came lazeez shawarma, which is also one of the better places. But, after trying pita boss I can easily say it is the BEST. I have been eating shawarmas for years and this is best joint in GTA..!! The real creamy garlic sauce prepared by the owner Anthony himself is just too good. Also, ask for special habanero sauce spicy for the extra kick. The prep of the sandwich itself is better as Anthony makes sure that it is served hot and well toasted with garlic butter to add the right crispyness.  TIP: Do not take it to Go..! Sit at the bar and let the genius make a mouthwatering sandwich for you. Enjoy with as much garlic sauce and harbanero sauce as they placed right on the bar..! (Osmows charges for extra garlic sauce). Anthony is a pleasure to talk to and he provides great customer service..!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I discovered Pita Boss while looking for a good place to eat before our hike on the Bruce Trail. We both got the Shawarma on Rice ($8.50) and it was delicious. My friend got the mild and I got it spicy. The chicken was cooked perfectly and not dry. The seasoning was well done as well as it wasn't too bland or too salty. Both dishes were smothered in what looked like a tzatziki sauce and a sweet/spicy sauce. My only complaint is that there was actually TOO much sauce. I love my sauces and usually prefer it very saucy but this was a bit much. Next time I'll get it on the side instead.   Parking is easily found right outside. There's limited seating but I don't think it gets very packed as it's in a pretty remote location and I noticed a lot of people got take-out. Service was very friendly and you even get a free pop (I got the grape crush) for checking in with Yelp."}
{"text":"Really tasty meat and the food is great here! So close to Toronto premium outlets and this would be my preferred place to go!"}
{"text":"Just had my chicken shawarma dinner frim this pkace and i have to admit that iz was very disappointing. It was so salty and i love salty food..rice was bland anf meat no flavor at all..it wss my first time there and definetly my last...it is one of the worst shawarma's that i ever had..it feels really bad when you throw your whole lunch in the garbage. ."}
{"text":"We went by this place quite a few times but thought it was going to be just another Pita place and opted to get pizza instead which is in the same Plaza. Well we finally decided to try it and so happy we did. Honestly it is the best chicken shawarma I've ever had. I had mine medium heat which had just enough kick in it. Their white garlic sauce is so tasty! We've been back a few times and have not been disappointed, they are very consistent with their portion size which is quite large and taste. Next time we will try the rice. Definitly give this place a try, you will not be disappointed. As for pizza we've never been in there since we tried Pita Boss!"}
{"text":"I have been to different countries who are famous for their shwarmas, UAE etc. I love shwarma and i can say it without any doubt that this is the best shwarma i've ever had. The chicken marination is spot on. I have had all the famous shwarmas in Mississauga and this is the best. The owner is superfriendly. The seating place is not bad either. U gotta try it ONCE!!"}
{"text":"I have no idea what the hype is all about. The food was extremely mediocre. It wasn't bad and it wasn't good. It was just meh. I found their hot sauce is what made everything so meh. The hot sauce had no spice but gave their food a really sour acidic flavour which I did not enjoy at all."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best chicken shawarma wraps you'll have in the GTA (certainly the best I've had so far).  The service is quick, the portions are very generous, and most importantly, the food is delicious. The ingredients taste fresh and the chicken is tender and moist (it still boggles my mind how some of these places can serve dry, tasteless chicken buried under a mountain of old iceberg lettuce and call it shawarma). Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Really good food.  Had the chicken schwarma plate.  Sat at the bar and watched them cook using all fresh ingredients.  Hot sauce was just right!  Delish.  Wish i could take this place home to NY with me!  Service saw very nice! Fast and yummy.  Perfect for me eating alone at the bar. I feel like a boss!"}
{"text":"Simple cheap n delicious pitas! Contrasting of other small shops, they take a lot of care n time to make each dish . Small place so not great for groups but excellent for 1-2 people and take out . Very clean too."}
{"text":"Another GTA Shawarma joint that lacks authenticity and just copies the osmows model.   Aesthetics: I actually really like the interior. Nice wood tables. Although not a lot of seating space, they've made up for it with a bar that runs all along the kitchen.  I like the marketing of \"who's the boss\".  They had the slogan on cups, and they had forks and stuff in them...although the cup in front me was dirty and I didn't really feel like grabbing my fork out of it.  Food:  Warning sign is when you see someone take the shaved chicken off the pit and let it sit in a grill. Hilarious. The amount of places that do this baffle me. That would be like toasting your bread and then frying it in a pan. Shawarma is supposed to shaved off the spit into your wrap. Other than that I liked their chicken. The seasoning was okay and the amount sufficient. Unfortunately they've joined the sell out club and provide a garlic sauce that is nothing like the traditional garlic paste. As a chicken wrap it's okay.  But I did find the shawarma salad way too salty and sour from the sauces.    Service: my type for service; not forced pleasantry, but rather acting like normal down to earth folks.   Of course any shawarma menu that shows a different cultures food (souvlaki) is another flag for me. I live close to this spot and there's very limited selection in the area so that might be the only reason I'll stop in on the rare occasion looking for a quick bite.  It's not terrible nor great food, just the usual western bastardization of a classic."}
{"text":"Price is a little more then the other places but, the food is good. Service was also great as we were able to receive our food while sitting and relaxing. Only negative is price as this place is a couple dollars over all the others."}
{"text":"This is the best shawarma in all of Mississauga or probably Toronto. The owner Anthony is way cool too. Make sure you try it if want to get bossed up on shawarma."}
{"text":"On the rocks.. Better then osmows! Keep it up guys.  Much bettet quality and always the same unlikr other places which arent consistent"}
{"text":"This place is more about quality over quantity.   Very unique tasting Shawarma that was fresh and quite large.  I was really liking the atmosphere at the location as it was far less busy then the osmows streetsville that I'm used to.  It was also nicely furnished.  Had a chill vibe.   the shwarma wrap was good and big but the sauce I had was too sweet.  I think it was the hot sauce but I'm not certain.  The chicken was super tasty and crispy right from the pit.  They added some powder while toasting the wrap which added some flavor.  Next time I'll hold off on the hot sauce.  My go to place when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Been almost a year now and this place is still pretty great! I always get chicken shawrama extra toasted and extra garlic and its always delicious!"}
{"text":"It's just okay.. I prefer the taste of osmos. The owner seems to work hard and be nice but the quality of the food just isn't always there. Very inconsistent. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Yummy yum yum!! My 2nd night in a row eating this! I don't know if this is authentic but wowzers- love has really been put into this food. The shawarma salad is fantastic and the sandwich is amazing. Slightly sweeter taste than the shawarma Im used to, but the sweetness accentuates the food!! Probably going to come back here once a week at least!"}
