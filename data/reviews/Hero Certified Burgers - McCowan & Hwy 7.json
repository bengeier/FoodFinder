{"text":"If you want a real, juicy, meaty burger - come to Hero's Burger.  Although it is on the more expensive side - it is worth the money. I ordered the 6 or 8 oz burger with several toppings (toppings have additional charges) - but it is well worth the $$.  I upgraded to the milkshake - but it was just a vanilla milkshake with chocolate powder added, and they didn't add enough powder because my shake still tasted like vanilla and the color of the shake was a very light brown.    But I came for the burger - so 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Ultimate fries? They taste like they were steamed but not fried.. burger is averaged but not good enough for this price. One extra star for the friendly and helpful Staff"}
{"text":"We had Hero burgers at the Ricoh center while  watching a Marlies game.  My kids enjoyed their burgers so much  they wanted to go back again just for the burgers.  Fast forward to a few weeks later, we decided to go to the local hero burger near us. Ordered the 8oz burgers, what we received were two 4oz burgers on each burger,  that would have been fine but the burgers were dried out, likely cooked ahead of time, nowhere near the burger we had at the Ricoh center.  Needless to say we were very disappointed with our food.  Would not go back to this location."}
{"text":"This Hero Burgers location is in the same plaza as Party City and Discovery Day Spa. There's lot of parking in this lot, which is a plus. However, it's very difficult to leave this plaza or you're forced to go one way because there's no left turns out.   The food here is standard and tastes like all other hero burgers. I ordered the 4 oz Hero Burger Combo with sweet potato fries and a drink. I also got a side of hero sauce for $0.59 as dipping sauce for my sweet potato fries.  It took about 15 minutes to make my food. I was the only one in the restaurant at the time. In my opinion it's a bit too long for fast food. When I ordered my food I had advise that my food was for here, but when they called my order number it was in a to go bag. The cashier said \"oops I forgot it was for here. Let me save this paper bag so I can reuse it later.\" The paper bag was already greasy at this point.. so I'm not sure who/what he was saving it for. I hope it wasn't for the next person.. I find that kind of gross and cross contamination can happen.  This cashier also had a low chair behind the counter and was on their phone the entire time. I wasn't really impressed with the service here, but the food was decent. If you're looking for a really quick bite I would not recommend to come here.   I live between this location and the Hero Burgers on Markham Road and Steeles. I would recommend going to that other location instead of this one. The other location also offers 20% off when you check in with Yelp. This location DID NOT have the same offer unfortunately."}
{"text":"Wonderful for an eat-in or take out burger joint just around the corner. You can really taste the difference in quality. Near quite a few burger joints (two Harveys no less) but I like the taste that much more.   The staff always has a smile and are always helpful if you have any questions!  If you've never been: It's a wonderful build your own burger location with dozens of options including gluten free and optional everything. A little pricey but it matches most of the stuff in the area.  Great for picky kids who know what they want and picky parents alike."}
{"text":"Sure it's a chain but it's by far the best one.  Burgers are made to order, and even though they're not ground fresh, they are are incredibly juicy and tasty.  They have the perfect burger to bun ratio, not to mention one of the best burger buns around.  The fries are really great here, too, and make a delicious poutine.  Place is clean and staff is friendly including the cook who always throws a smile and wave our way.   Definitely our go to burger place in east Markham."}
{"text":"Service is AMAZING from the owner and her husband! Food is ridiculously filling and delicious.  They don't chince on anything.  Definitely get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and tried their signature burger and their action hero burger (+combo). The burgers itself are a good size, the patties aren't dry, and the sauces inside the burgers are great. It is a little on the pricey side, however. The fries are salted well but they were a little too oily for me. Nothing really wow'd me but it's not a bad place and I would come back here again if I'm craving a burger. The staff was nice and friendly as well!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer & huge fan of Hero Burgers. I wasn't impressed at the poor quality & portions of this location. It's the closest location to where i live since they closed the Richmond Hill (Major Mackenzie) location.  My fries were 3/4 full similar to what someone else posted - 3rd time this has happened. We said something, but they said that's the portion?!? Never has the container been that low at any other location. My burger was so overdone that it had a rubbery consistency and was awkward to bite into. Cold gravy, cold rings. You would have to wonder if everything is pre-made (which is never the norm at Hero) and left to stay warm for the lunch or dinner rush or leftover from those times?!? The only thing that was good hence the 2 stars, was their chicken strips. At $5.99 per order you get 5-6 small strips - more like nuggets actually. They are breaded & seasoned well for good crunch. You get 1 dipping sauce per order, which is one of their sauces for the burgers. 1 is never enough, but if you want another one they will charge you. Your best bet is if you order a burger, get sauce on the side for it to use for your strips. Also, you can make any of their items into a combo, but not their strips. By the time you get fries, strips & a drink, you're spending around $12-$13 just for your kids to have tenders & fries with a drink.  Rumour has it that a location is coming to Markham. Fingers crossed that it's true and hoping it's a different franchisee. Otherwise, it's back to Golden Star & Burger's Priest for me!"}
{"text":"Asked for a 6 Oz. Signature Burger combo. The burger itself is moderate, nothing special to say. The fries were really good, though, with a very nice mouth-feel and are super-fresh."}
{"text":"I was craving a burger on a Saturday night. We ordered a 6oz signature burger, soul burger, zucchini fries, a mushroom poutine, and a bottled pop.   The service was amazing!! I took some time to decided what to get and the cashier was very accommodating with my indecisiveness. Also, when my food was ready, she brought it out to my table--very kind! I wish I could have tipped her!  My zucchini fries were filled to the top of the container... I saw some reviews that said their fries were only 2/3 full. Strange but I don't think that's the norm. Mushroom poutine was delicious, a very nice rich smokey flavour in the gravy!! I enjoyed my burger... I just wished it had more condiments (lettuce, tomato, etc.) inside because that's what I enjoy most when I'm eating a burger--a personal preference.   Apart from that, the place is also pretty clean, I saw the kind cashier lady bussing and wiping tables."}
{"text":"The service was really good which made the atmosphere very welcoming. I ordered the 6oz signature burger combo with sweet potato fries and it tasted amazing. Unfortunately the sweet potato fries didn't come with any sauces so i asked the associate if any sauces were available and he said no but asked if I would like any. Long story short, he gave us two different sauces on the house. All in all I had a great experience with this specific hero burger location and plan on returning."}
{"text":"I like Hero Burger. Even with its outrageous prices I still enjoy a Hero Burger once in a while. I've been to many locations but wanted to give this new one a try. In terms of food, it's what you expect but recently, signing up with the app gets you $5 off bad guy must order online. Food took the usual long wait. My \"beef\" was the grumpy cashier who looked like someone she hated her job. No expression and not very helpful. My guess is it's a family business because when I asked for ketchup, she handed one packet only.   What killed it was how messy my burger was. (See pictures) At this price point and with a sole focus on placing quality meat between two buns, in this day in age, you need to have customer service and presentable food.   Not coming back for a while."}
{"text":"Love this location! Burgers are always prepared well, toppings are fresh, sides are always well cooked, basically a great location! I have never had a problem out of the numerous times that I have came here. They add extra sauce and toppings when you want it! The poutines are hot and fresh as well! The staff explain and help you when its needed. Definitely a go-to place for me. There's also lots of parking since it's in a plaza and if you order using the app or Skip the dishes app, you can be in and out within 5 minutes.   One thing I actually don't like are the sweet potato fries! They are too oily and I have had better ones but not the location's fault cause I've had sweet potato fries at other Hero locations and I felt the same way. I do wish they had a YELP discount like the other Markham location does though! Overall love this place!"}
{"text":"Came here to order a serving of fries to go. Very disappointed at the amount they consider as a serving when the fries do not even fill the entire cup. See picture.  This is what came out of my takeout bag when i got home. Makes me wonder what else they cut back on.  Front counter service was great although the kitchen was pretty slow during lunch time on a weekend , especially when I only ordered fries, still had to wait for 10 minutes!"}
{"text":"The burger was good but nothing to jump up and down about. It came in this cool packaging. Got sweet potato fries which were not that great when compared to other places. The fries were not crispy enough, more on the soft side and it didn't come with any special dipping sauce. Drinks are refillable through their cool touch screen drink option. All this came to about $15 after taxes. A bit on the expensive side if you ask me."}
{"text":"Recently opened at the redeveloped southeast corner of Highway 7 and McCowan Road, this Hero Burger place is a welcome addition to the folks of East Markham, where the previous nearest Hero Burger place was in Richmond Hill.  This place was deserted when I arrived at around 9pm, so perhaps a 10pm closure would suffice more than an 11pm closure. I ordered a 4oz Hero Burger with white cheddar, portobello mushrooms, red onions, and hero sauce. Everything was good in the burger except the cheese, which wasn't melted enough. I assume the chef was rushing a bit, since the burger was prepared and finished below the 5 minute threshold.  Service was good, but mind you I was the only person there, so I can't really judge on how service really is when (if?) this place is busy."}
{"text":"I've been to a hero Certified Burgers before in the past and I really did not find anything spectacular about them (then again, I don't think I actually ordered a burger that time). However, for some reason, i was really impressed this time around. The burger was very juicy and the fries were delicious. The service here was great too! If it wasn't so expensive and out of the way for me, I would come here for lunch more often."}
{"text":"I use to go to the harveys across the street. They had small burgers and small portions of fries. Sometimes i had to order the double or the Angus to have a satisfied meal. When Hero Burgers opened up, i didnt try them until months later. Been there about 3 times so far, which is not much, but amazing burgers and fries!! Always satisfied after a meal. It hits the spot. Staff is friendly!! $8 for a 8oz angus burger, and $2.99 for fries, and $2.49 for bottomless fountain drink plus taxes comes to over just over $15.  But as i said, its very satisfying!!  Clean seating area too. Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"$15.00 tax included for a 8oz Hero Burger Combo with Cheddar Cheese.  Burger tasted good, but definitely not the best.. Patty was pretty flavourful, but it reminded me of a frozen high-end supermarket burger patty.. It's definitely not 100% beef and I don't think it's made fresh in the store..  Been to other burger joints that are much better and burger is 100% meat..  Fries were soggy..  Burger 3 stars Price 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"The staff at this Hero Burgers are very friendly and helpful if you have questions. The restaurant is very clean and the staff are quick to clean the tables when they are cleared. I also love their drink machine which let's you combine different flavours."}
{"text":"This was my first time that I have been to this Hero Certified Burgers location, and I have to say that I absolutely love it, especially the service above all since the employees are all very kind and patient and don't try to rush your order. The burger that I ordered with the sweet potato fries were out of this world, at least for a fast food place. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a good burger once in a while who doesn't mind spending a bit of money on it."}
{"text":"Definitely a go-to place for me when I need a fast and good meal. The thing I love about Hero is their consistency, you go in and you know you're always going to get a delicious burger.  The friendly staff and abundant parking is obviously a plus as well.  Takes about 10 minutes for your meal to be ready, drinks are refillable, sides are always freshly made.."}
{"text":"A bit hard to get in the plaza during high traffic times if you are coming from the east end of highway 7. I can't really complain about the burger. It wasn't anything special, it was just a good 6 oz burger. The cool thing about the restaurant is you can make your own drink from 100s of flavours."}
