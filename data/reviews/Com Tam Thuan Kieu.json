{"text":"The food was good the people were nice I liked the setting and lay out I went here on my break from work and even though I didn't finish my food it still filled me up and had me ready for the rest of my day hopefully next time I come here that'll happen again so far so good. I like this place"}
{"text":"One of the Viet restaurants we hit up a lot.  The rice plates are very generous and taste good.  The spring rolls and egg rolls are also good.  Had a few different broken rice plates and had no complaints thus far.  Not too many dessert choices, but a pretty good spot if you have that rice craving.  Also, next to market and boba spots...that was a plus."}
{"text":"Good com tam.  The meat portion is little bit smaller compare to com tam in California. Good place for com tam  around Tempe/Mesa area."}
{"text":"Food were ok.  Nothing to brag about.  Service was a bit hard to get.  Typical Asian service I guess."}
{"text":"I decided to take my friend here for lunch. He was visiting from LA. and he has taken me to a number of places in Santa Ana (aka Little Saigon). I wanted his opinion on the food here. We arrived just before the lunch crowd so we could enjoy the food. He ordered #61 the bean curd skin w/ shrimp (i know it sounds scary, but it loses something in the translation) and I had #58 grilled pork chop, steam egg (Vietnamese meatloaf), meatball and shredded pork. Our order came quickly and we dug in. I asked my friend how was his food and he said it was pretty good. As for my dish I thought it lacked big flavors. Don't get me wrong it was good, but it seemed toned down. We both agreed it would be a slightly above average joint in Santa Ana. In Phoenix it is one of the better ones. A couple of comments if you go, bring cash as they do not accept credit or debit cards. And if you want to try something new it helps if you bring someone that speaks the language."}
{"text":"This is one of many restaurants inside Mekong Marketplace. It is one of the top 3 for sure! I love this place for the variety of broken rice dishes which all come standard with a bowl of broth and a small salad in addition to your \"meat\" entree. The portions are fairly large. I've had the pork ribs with the pork skin (Bi) and meat loaf (cha) and well as the korean ribs and some of the noodle dishes. I've never had pho here.

My Vietnamese parents went here and they LOVED the Crepes. They are some of the toughest critics when it comes to restaurants and they were raving about these delicious yellow pancakes filled with porks, shrimp, onions, mushrooms and bean sprouts. I must go back to try these.  The service is very fast as mentioned in previous posts. Definitely represents Vietnamese take out very well!"}
{"text":"Food seems to taste better than most viet places I've been around town even though I have tasted better, they have good customer service but their prices for everything seems to be a little higher than most places I've been to."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place at Mekong Plaza. Their Bun Bo Hue, a noodle soup with beef and blood pudding, is actually better than some of the versions I had in Vietnam: very beefy with lots of fresh herbs on the side. It's a large portion for a good price. I would review their other dishes but I just can't help ordering Bun Bo Hue every time I go :-)"}
{"text":"Whenever I miss vietnamese food back home. I always go to Com tam! They have the best food ever. It's a little bit pricey but I tell you guys it was all worth it. They have 7 to 10 combination. Yum! You will really enjoy your food for sure!"}
{"text":"I had vermicelli noodles with beef and egg roll. The most impressive part is egg roll, which is crispy and savory."}
{"text":"Well they now do accept credit cards.  I've eaten here several times, I love trying new things, this has got to be the first place I've eaten where everything brought out was delicious and satisfying.  This place doesn't compare to other Vietnamese restaurants.  Just try it out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Yummy  I love ph, and I've been to many a Vietnamese restaurant looking for ph. This place has wonderful ph, especially for Arizona. I love their broken rice dishes as well; the eggs and the pork are delicious."}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week for my fix of Vietnamese food.  The Nem Nuong Cuong are delicious, very close to what you would find in So Cal or in Nha Trang, VN even.  The Bo Luc Lac with red rice is also quite tasty!  If you're super duper hungry, go with the broken rice plate with 7- or 10-meat options but these dishes are great for sharing between 2 people.  I usually get my food to-go, so while I wait for my food to be prepared, I run to Mekong market to do some of my weekend grocery shopping too.  Super convenient!"}
{"text":"Huge menu of various Vietnamese comfort foods.  My friends and I had various vermicelli bowls and all were flavorful with a good mix of noodles to proteins.  After being warned that AZ lacked good Asian restaurants, my friends and I were pleasantly surprised by the variety available at the restaurant and within Mekong Square.  Definitely a place with a little something for everyone."}
{"text":"Thuan Kieu is a Vietnamese restaurant that specialize in rice dishes.  Although they don't have Pho, they do have noodles and vermicelli.
I think their most famous dish is Broken Rice with (crispy) Bean Curd Skin w/ Shrimp.  Needless to say, it is very good. 

I ordered a plate with the bean curd, shredded pork, steam egg and charbroiled meatball and my wife ordered broken rice with grilled pork chop.  Both come with nuoc cham dipping sauce.  I've never been impressed with other restaurant's shredded pork (too dry) and steam egg (dry & hard) but Thuan Kieu managed to exceed my expectation.
The shredded pork is soft, same with the steamed egg (without being soggy).  The charbroiled meatball and pork chop are also very good.
We also ordered Nem Nuong Nha Trang.  They are spring rolls with charbroiled meatballs, crispy eggroll skins and a bunch of veggies.  I have to say they are the best in the valley, I can just eat these for lunch (they come in a set of four).  If you want better Nem Nuong, you will have to go to Brodard in LA Little Saigon. 

I highly recommend this Vietnamese restaurant.  Their rice dishes are top notch.  Don't forget to bring some cash since they are a cash only restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife, brother and I wanted to celebrate Tet with a good dinner.  I asked the waiter to give us three dishes appropriate for the occasion - and left the ordering completely to him with the exception to the Cha Gio and the Goi Cuon . The food and service were excellent. !  We left stuffed and with plenty of leftovers to take home. Happy New Year!"}
{"text":"Located at  Mekong Plaza, right by UnPhogettable. Easy to find and the complex although busy, has plenty of parking. You can tell it is family owned, and a member of the family is always at hand. People from all walks of life are serviced and many of the patrons are Vietnamese. A very good sign that the place is authentic. The place is neat, although the tray of condiments can use a bit of dusting. Service is quick and efficient. Prices are reasonable considering portions.

The chow is simply flavorful and fresh tasting! From the Broken Rice dishes to the Rice and Egg Noodle Soups, Vermicelli dishes.  The Phan Cha Gio Tom and Phan Goi Cuon are top faves of my family.

Been here a few times before and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Located right inside the entrance to Mekong Plaza, this small and dimly lit restaurant serves large portions of tasty food.  The Spring Rolls were uniquely crisp; the peanut sauce very thick.  Unlike many Vietnamese restaurants --- especially the more west you head from central Phoenix --- this restaurant has an extensive menu, though a good number of the dishes seem to be for take out only.  Be aware that the rice dishes come with a lot of rice; that is not to say, however, that there is an imbalance in respect to other ingredients:  yes, there's lots of rice, but there's also a lot of meat and other ingredients on the main dishes.  The cha gio resembles croquettes more than they do egg rolls, but they're tasty, too.  Each egg roll comes with a very large piece of Romaine lettuce to wrap it in.

To sum up, if you are at the plaza, this is a nice place to eat with reasonable prices for the portions.  Service can be spotty  (i.e., it may be a while before they take your order), but once they take your order, they're fast and attentive."}
{"text":"All of the dishes were fantastic, when the new owner took over. Now the dishes have been of such poor quality that I would rather eat \"Asian\" frozen food."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been looking for a good Vietnamese restaurant and we have found the place.  This place has the and I mean THE BEST rice dish in the state of AZ. There's so many other good dishes to choose from.  Their customer service is excellent as we have visited every time.  So far we have tried almost all of the dishes that's on the menu.  I love their signature rice dish that's consist of 7 items.  I live 50+ miles from this restaurant and believe me it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Very good dishes of broken rice. I think the soup that comes along with the rice has some MSG. Other noodle soup dishes are just ok."}
{"text":"Lots of good Vietnamese food. Excellent in fact. The service is prompt, though more impersonal than I would expect for a recurring customer."}
{"text":"If you're indecisive, either go the whole enchilada w/ one of the special combo's (the first two on the list) or order your individual dishes.  We learned that the hard way.  First time we ordered the combo thinking it was a appetizer and then four individual dishes rice which were basically repeats of what was in the huge combo platter... way OD'd on the prepared meat(loaf-y) dishes. 

Went again, getting Korean chop and some other chop rice combos... fried egg rolls don't look typical (blistered almost) but the taste is fine.

Food is ok, no wow factor but just A-OK."}
{"text":"Very sad. This place has good food but the service is horrible. They say they close at 9pm as posted on the door and in their yelp info, however if you walk in at 8:27 pm you will be turned away at the door saying we aren't open sorry. Now, I know everyone has their own business and runs it in a manner that they find suits them best, yet you would think if they would like customers to keep returning they would stay open the designated time they advertise! This event left a bad taste in my mouth and unfortunately I won't be returning, nor would I recommend this place anymore!"}
{"text":"I was sick so I wanted some rice gruel with pork blood pudding. The food came out quickly but the boat spoon was crusted by something. I wiped it several times to try to get it off."}
{"text":"The same com tam as the location in Westminister...flavors don't suffer at all but the portions and price do a little. Still, delicious and cheap Vietnamese. Love their crispy eggrolls and their che ba mau."}
{"text":"Finally a Vietnamese place that doesn't focus on pho. In fact, they don't even have pho on the menu. If I'm going to be eating in Mekong, this is my restaurant of choice. The broken rice plates are huge. 2 people can easily be stuffed with the 7 item combo. The menu looks scary, but it's just permutations of the toppings on your rice. 

Another dish I often get is noodle soup with pig's foot and blood cubes. Yes, it sounds scary, but it's really satisfying. Fat slippery noodles. Porky meat. Blood cubes kind of taste like iron-y tofu. The last time I went though, they had really large chunks of blood so it didn't absorb the broth flavor as much. All other times I've ordered it though, the cubes have been smaller so it isn't as overwhelmingly....blood-y."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and great customer service! We had spring rolls and the rib plate and it's by far the best food we've had in the area! Margaret was our server and she was friendly and helpful. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"I didn't like this place so much, maybe because I'm Vietnamese? But their food is nothing special really. Very common for a Vietnamese restaurant but their specialty is their rice plates so I would hope it was delicious.

I love my food to come out hot if it is suppose to be hot or at least warm maybe but when I order their special rice plate, the meats came out cold and the rice was a little warm. Didn't even bother asking them to reheat it because the staff there seems no where to be found. I do like that the plates do come with a bowl of hot soup which do come out hot [:

I don't know. If you don't have a Vietnamese mom who knows how to cook rice plates then I would recommend going here but I do have a mother who can do better so I definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"I love the Nem Nuong Nha Trang here. 
Its fresh, has that little crunchy in the middle of the roll that's a perfect combination with the Nem Nuong. It even tastes better with their special sauce. 
Trust me, its much better than Brodard"}
{"text":"I really don't know how they got high ratings! I ordered the nem nuong and it was horrible dnt get why my sauce was sour?! And the meat was sour wth overall this place sucks and I won't be returning. I guess I had high hopes of finding the best place in arizona but nothing compares to cali! Arizona just don't have that wow factor"}
{"text":"If your truly craving some true Vietnamese food then this is the place to go!! They offer such colossal portions and the service is wonderful too. 
   However, it honestly wasn't for me, not my kind of taste. But trust me if your a true Vietnamese food lover, then this is your place of food.
 It's also conveniently located in a plaza that has other small restaurants and a grocery store!!! 
***** Have fun!!!******"}
{"text":"I used to live in Orange County and I would never eat at this chain. But here in Mesa, this chain is better than other Vietnamese restaurants in the vicinity. I discovered that they have pretty good Hu Tieu nam vang and nem nuong Nha trang."}
{"text":"I'm from SoCal, home of Brodards and Summer Rolls who are known for their pork spring rolls and that yummy shrimp based (?) yellow sauce.

I finally found the place in Arizona that serves the same thing! And tastes pretty similar, definitely satisfies my nem nuong cravings. Their noodle soups are also tasty, overall a very solid Vietnamese restaurant in AZ!"}
{"text":"Broken rice dishes are good, portions are big but the place is really dirty and the service is horrible."}
{"text":"Very decent rice plates at reasonable prices. I've come here multiple times when it's busy to order take out, and it still gets done in under 10 minutes! Steaming hot when I pick it up, and still very hot after a 30 minute drive home!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Vietnamese place to eat at in the valley. I've tried just about every single one and I'd say this restaurant comes out on top by far.

A few things separate them from the rest of the pack, their service, the quality of food, the food portions, the variety, and the cleanliness of the restaurant. The portions they serve here are unbelievable, with any entree I was super stuffed. 

The egg rolls are the best I ever had, and the Thai Tea was on point too. I'd recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Holy crap, it's not a mirage...decent Bun Bo Hue w/ all the good stuff in AZ??!!

They specialize more in rice plates, so I was a bit tentative, but definitely worth getting when you feenin' for that pig blood."}
{"text":"Service can be a little scary! lol
But the food is fantastic, and I've loved everything I tried. They have very unique fried spring rolls (They assured me they had no egg products), super good. Unphogettable is great, but this is my new go to. The place is not as nice decor wise, but the food comes out super fast, and I think quite a few dishes are made better than Unphogettable! As a vegan I felt I am accommodated well there."}
{"text":"Right inside the Mekong Plaza as you walk in the main entrance. Place is very simple inside with really fast service although they both lack some charm.

Menu is rather large and is set up with a number system. They easily have over a hundred different choices. I like the assortment of items on the table like chilies, fish sauce, hoisin sauce, jalapeno peppers, etc. that you can use to customize your dishes.

Really enjoy the different appetizers such as the shrimp and pork rolls with their special peanut sauce and then some. The broken rice dishes are also a tasty favorite. Tried the some of the soups and thought they were good but seemed a little lack luster compared with what I have ordered at other places around town. Some items that say charbroiled seemed and tasted like they were maybe stir fried or cooked differently. It can get a little confusing but still worth the adventure.

Definitively a good value and a fun place to try out and experiment with new flavors that you may not have tried before.

3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"I was actually looking for a nice bowl of Pho and made a wrong turn.
Or a right turn.  Ended up ordering the  HU TIEU NAM VANG 
and it was EXCELLENT.  Service was excellent, environment was
adequate and I enjoyed as much of it as I could consume(ample quantity).

Highly enjoyable dining experience in less than enjoyable times."}
{"text":"This was my first time having a \"broken rice plate\" and I am HOOKED.

I had the #21 - the most expensive rice plate - and while the price did seem a tad high (especially considering Vietnamese food is usually very reasonably priced) it was absolutely delicious.

I recently frequented another Vietnamese place in Tempe, and their broken rice does not compare to Com Tam Thuan Kieu's at all.

I would absolutely love to come back, but the only thing stopping me is that #21 is kind of expensive for my frugal self. If they had a lunch special, I would definitely become a regular.

I had zero issues with the service. Pho is ok, but nothing spectacular.

If I come back, I'll try the cheaper broken rice plates, and report back to Yelp!"}
{"text":"2 1/2 rounded down to 2 (elsewhere I'd give it a 3, but there is too much good competition around here)  I came here because my favorite, Hue Gourmet, was closed today, Wednesday.  I'm not a big fan of this place, neither here nor in Tucson.  Maybe it's because I haven't had their specialty, broken rice.  I did have pork soup.  Middling."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review mainly because I come here almost every week so far. The main reason being that this is my favorite spot to get Vietnamese broken rice dishes. There might be better places in the Phoenix metro area but until I find a better spot I will continue to be a regular here. The people working at this restaurant probably recognize me by now and the service has actually improved over the past few months compared to my first visit when I initially came here."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place!? My favorite com tam restaurant at home in Orange County and here in Arizona! The food is always so delicious. I recommend getting the com tam thit nuong (grilled pork) it's not dry like how most places are :)

The service is great! Especially the girl that sits in front taking your orders; she's so sweet and pretty to look at also so that's a plus! Lol

If you want authentic Vietnamese food, come here! They have a big variety so if you're not feeling com tam they have other yummy selections as well!"}
{"text":"Ah this one is definitely my favorite for lunch/dinner. They have awesome grilled meat over rice with tons of flavors. Don't even expect to come here to try the soup or anything (which are not their specials) and then complain.... Try to eat their spring bowl portion or rice plates!
Food usually come quick within 5minutes :) Quick and friendly services!!! How can I say, I just love it !!!!"}
{"text":"Listen guys...this is going to be a very good traditional Vietnamese restaurant. You don't go for the over popular pho, soup dishes you go here for the speciality broken rice dishes! They just do it right, like how a Vietnamese mom will make it. Now I'm use to the old asian restaurants when it comes to service, they acknowledge you, take down your order, your food is great, and then you pay. You're not going to get bells and whistles here just some great food the way it should be done. Service and food has been amazing and consistent every time I've come."}
{"text":"So first off-the meatball spring roll with the crunchy piece of eggroll skin is heavenly, plus that crab dip?!  Omg SO SO good. I crave it and would eat it every day if I could! 
Also, although they do not have pho here, they DO have some delicious, cheap broken rice dishes. My fiancé got the broken rice rice dish with 7 different meats and all the meats from the pork chop, to the shredded pork were so fresh and on point. For legit Vietnamese broken rice dishes and the most Bonn ass spring rolls ever, go here."}
{"text":"Food is very good and delicious, only issue I had was finding hair imbedded inside the shrimp patty after taking it home and eating my leftovers for lunch."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the 10 meat dish w/ broken rice.  Big enough serving for 2 adults.  

Vermicelli paddy soaked with fish sauce plus grill meatball and spices are big winner for me.

Noodle dishes are pretty tasty as well."}
{"text":"Today my family went to eat com tam thuan kieu and order to go com tam suon bo dai han. When I went home and opened it, there was only bones no meat. I can not believe it. Very dissapointed."}
{"text":"It was my first time to try it out. The food was out in less than 10 minutes from ordering. Unfortunately, I was not able to stay and eat it fresh. I had to put my food in to go containers since my son decided to cry. I got home and enjoyed my meal. I think the meats were charboiled. The food was so full of flavors."}
{"text":"The actual food is pretty good and the prices are reasonable. The reason why a star was dropped on this restaurant is because I found a short black hair in my appetizer roll... Normally when this type of thing happens they would comp the dish and make you a new one. Instead, it was just hand taken back, a new one was made and that's it... That's not great service where I come from. I also had stomach issues after eating here. But, I'd probably still give it another try... Maybe it was just an off day? Everyone has them. 

Also would not recommend getting the ca phe sua da. It is pre-made in the back and brought out to you. It tasted burnt and not enough condensed milk to cover up that flavor."}
{"text":"By far the best Vietnamese food I've had. Most authentic. They don't serve pho so don't come here looking for it."}
{"text":"This is my go to rice spot. I love the food here as it is unique to the area. Their spring rolls have egg roll wrapper deep fried and rolled in it which seriously 
Make the world of difference. The egg rolls are fried in a spring roll rice paper wrapper which also make them different in texture. But great size and value for the money. The rice dishes are very generous and delicious."}
{"text":"A small restaurant just to the right of the entrance to the Mekong Plaza in Mesa.  It's specialty is Com Tam.  My son and I had dinner here on Sat night.  The eggrolls appetizer looks not so pretty.  The eggroll skin was all bubbled up and sorta whitish.  It's almost like they used a different type of eggroll paper than the normal ones on Vietnamese eggrolls.  But fortunately, they tasted just fine.  

We also ordered a plate of Com Tam Bi w/ pork chops, rolled beef, and pork patty (I think).  That came with all the right condiments and fish sauce.  We also split a bowl of their Hu Tieu Nam Vang.  Their version is served with clear glass noodles.  Both entrees tasted great!  We chowed down the delicious food.  

Service is pretty standard for a vietnamese restaurant.  They're going to take your order, bring food out, and make change.  Nothing more, nothing less.  They're not there to entertain you."}
{"text":"During my 1-hr lunch, I decided to give CTTK a try. 
I ordered their \"com tam bi cha suong\", which is broken rice with pork chop and other stuff which I can't translate to english (sorry). 
I like the fact that the meal come with a small bowl of soup broth, which is common but I was delighted to find a piece of pork meat with chewy tendon in the soup. The soup was just perfect for me. Not too salty or bland. 
The broken rice was kind of dry, but once you pour the fish sauce on, it's good. The pork chop look very appealing along with the cucumber and pickled vegetable. Although it would be perfect if they put some cut tomatoes on my rice.
I haven't had \"com tam\" for a while so not sure what the average price for the dish would be. I look at their price, it can range from 6.99 to 7.99 depending on you want with your broken rice. 

As for the place, it is very new and I like the ikea dim light setting and the loud vietnamese songs that they are playing, which is good so you don't have to listen to what the other table is talking about. Although I would suggest they pick a different genre of Vietnamese songs."}
{"text":"Com tam thuan kieu rock my socks!  It is the best com tam in AZ. there is another one in santa anna and i've been there, but it's not as good as this one. prices are great. but just stick to their Com tam. don't expect them to have good pho when this place is all about com tam."}
{"text":"I've been here a lot, but I've always had the broken rice dish.  I brought my parents here while they were visiting to get their take on it.  

The broken rice dishes are all great.  The menu might look giant, but all the dishes are just slight variations of each other.  If you had broken rice with about 11 different things you can get on it... just imagine the different variations of menu items you can write.  

My dad had the bi suon ta hu ky which is shredded pork, pork chop, and a tofu skin wrap filled with shrimp.  He really liked it and said it reminded him of something that he would get in northern cali.

My mom and I ordered dishes that are really hard to find at other restaurants.  She had these little rice vermicelli pattie noodles with some pork and a fish sauce topping.  She said the vermicelli was a little dry, but the pork was really good.

I had the banh canh which is an udon like noodle in a  a light pork broth.  The broth was really good.  I think it's better than the one next door (unphogettable).  If you look at the broth, it's crystal clear which is something that's hard to do.  

Pricing is really fair with around 7.99 a dish that would have anyone walking away really full.

I give it only 4 stars, because the tea situation really weirds me out.  They pour tea in a tall glass that would be used for water.  The glass was really hot, and it cooled down really quickly.  My mom even asked if they had a pot of tea, and they said no.  She said a pot of tea would stay warm longer and taste a lot better.

Overall I would definitely come here and eat anytime while I'm grocery shopping.  I've actually made my way to this place after a long night of drinking to cure the blues."}
{"text":"Broken rice and 10 different meats. There are 2 egg rolls which were really greasy and salty, there is 1 pork patty, 1 shrimp patty, 1 shimp wrapped with tofu wrap, 2 grilled shrimps, bbq pork chop , pork sausage, and shredded pork skin The meats are not flavorful. Nothing special. 

They can make the food less greasy so there won't be an after grease taste afterward."}
{"text":"Believe it or not but Vietnamese food isn't just about Pho or variation of noodle soups. We love rice too especially when it's broken rice. What started as something for the poor to eat because farmers couldn't sell broken rice, now it's a specialty. Anyways, this restaurant has some of the best Broken Rice dishes, I have ever ate and they don't mess around. You'd think the portions be small for eeny weeny little Asian people? Nope, not here. They are freaking huge. Enough so, that they fill my fat butt up. Now if you're not up for grilled meats, meatloafs and rice, they served other traditional Vietnamese foods as well and I never had a bad meal here. Service isn't too bad either."}
{"text":"I came in for the usual Short Ribs dish. The portions here are very generous. I always have enough left to eat for the next day. The service here is fast in and out. The prices here are fair especially for the portions they give you. Always satisfied! So far everything I've ordered here have been great FRESH and AUTHENTIC. 

I would consider myself a regular here and don't see it changing. I love  this place!"}
{"text":"The first we ate (me & hubby)   ,we can't believe, OMG
very delicious BBQ , we always order no 1 and no 20 , 
next time no 1 and no 21 or 22 ,not order to much,

they accept  credit card  visa or master, but  not american express.
 for us , not  soup, sometimes aroma(smell) soup fishy.
This place inside Mekong Plaza ( and opposite Mekong Market.)
I recommend this place for all  BBQ ."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Al Green - How Can You Mend A Broken Heart)

I can think of other places, when to have my lunch
Was everything a Yelper could want to do
I could always eat Vietnamese
I was never told about their \"Nam Nuong\"

How can you mend a broken rice?
How can I try the pork and eggrolls now? (tell me)
How can you stop that fish sauce from flowing?
What makes my world go round?


Com Tam Thuan Kieu I would say is best known for their broken rice entree.  I usually go for that before I even think about browsing the menu.  

Secondly, I think their \"Nam Nuong\" is probably one of my favorites in town; charbroiled Vietnamese sausage strips, lettuces, fried noodles, and bean sprouts.  The texture of the cured salty meat and smokiness is accompanied by the crunchy texture of the fried noodles, bean sprouts and lettuce.  Along with this delectable dish is the sauce; which is orange in color with a peanut and what I can only describe as somewhat like a red pepper aioli and red chili mixture.  I could be wrong, but it's definitely the star of the night for me.  

For my entree I went with a broken rice dish of course, which came with the Vietnamese meat sausage, shredded pork skin, eggrolls, pork chops, bean curd skin with shrimp, and shrimp paste.  Yes, indeed it was a loaded dish.  I would say my favorites were the eggrolls and the pork chops.  Eggrolls here are tad bit different from what I'm used to.  The ingredients within is familiar, but the shell itself is what I describe as a crustacean like look with an extra crunchy stickiness to it since it has the tendency to stick to your teeth slightly as you bite into it.  

Overall, Com Tam Thuan Kieu has been around since the start of Mekong Plaza so they're definitely doing something right.  Service can be a hit or miss here, but nothing you can complain about. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious no doubt, but the service is atrocious. The older man ( mid 40s -50s ) man who is always there who takes most of the orders is real rude. He rushes you while you're ordering and gives an attitude when you're trying to decide. He also never wants to come and give you more water or ask if you need anything else. And if he does asks... wellp get ready for an attitude. Service needs to be better. Don't get me wrong, we love this rice place, but he just needs to get his attitude in check. This happens EVERY time we come in and it's not only towards us it's everyone.

The food is delicious though. Probably one of the few com tam places that taste good. Their shrimp cakes are amazing. Just wish the service was up there with the food. All in all great food, ehh service. Hope they can do better, then they will be perfect!"}
{"text":"i had such high hopes, as i LOOOOVE vietnamese broken rice dishes! 
but this place just didn't live up to my expectations or prior experiences. while extensive, the portions are quite petite for a viet restaurant... and their cafe sua da (iced viet coffee) was.... chocolatey. like a mocha mix. 

does this mean i'll never come back? no. but i will def never be a regular here. what a tragedy."}

{"text":"I have no idea how the food is. I ordered at 825 and the guy said my only option was take out because they close at 830. Hmm, well posted hours say closing is 9. Place was busy, so not sure why they would close early and it was before 830 anyway. Learn a little customer service."}
{"text":"This one is gonna be short - I'm in a rush and just want to leave the stars.  Best part of the meal was the Nem Nuong appetizer - a Viet spring roll with a crispy shell rolled up inside to give it crunch, and an awesome dipping sauce.  I had the short ribs broken rice - quite tasty and the \"broken\" rice actually made the dish better than your average meat over rice dish.  My wife got the combo with 7 meats - most were okay but a few were a bit odd and fish ballish...  I'll stick to the beef if we go back ..."}
{"text":"The only Com Tam restaurant I have tried in Arizona since they don't have much restaurants like this here! Located right in the Mekong Plaza to the right of Unphogettable and the main entrance into the Plaza and the market!
Being known for their Broken Rice plates with a side of variety of different meats, they also have many more items to choose from such as Congee, Spring Rolls, and Vermicelli from what I recall from taking a look at the menu!
I had their Com Tam Thit Bo Dai Han which is Broken Rice with Korean BBQ Ribs. It was delicious!!!!! Nothing to complain about the service was great and always refilled my water and always came to our table to please us and gave us what we needed! Did not wait too long for food about 10 minutes and portions are huge to me! I barely finished it!"}
{"text":"The Foods here are great. The prices are very reasonable. Service is fine. The only thing that I don't like is the cashier. Sometimes the cashier is nice but sometimes is not. One time, I came to the cashier and asked for the check, I said clearly \"can I please have the check?\", the cashier just typed something in the computer and told me \"$26. Something\" (for the whole conversation she did not say hi, smile, or bother looking at my face, just so rude, it's not even funny), I felt bad for a moment, paid, and asked for a box, did not answer or reply or anything about the request, she asked me to sign on the receipt and gave me the box. That was the only bad experience I've had, other than that, the food is very authentic, great price, good people. Perfect dried Nam Vang egg noodles. Just like ik Vietnam"}
{"text":"The day of my son's surgery back in June, I was starving at the hospital waiting for him to start his procedure.  When he finally went in I couldn't wait any longer for food, I was starving! I remembered my friends use to come to Mekong market and get broken rice, I loved it! But I wasn't sure where the place was so I called them and asked. They said it was right next to the super market and the door had a lady on it. Went in and there was a girl up front, I asked her if they served broken rice here, and she laughed at me and rolled her eyes. \"Um that's what our name says, can't you read.\" Wtf, umm its in Vietnamese.. later on she said \" Are you Vietnamese? No wonder you didn't know we served broken rice.\" Well besides slightly rude service, I enjoyed their combination broken rice that has everything in it and the soup it came with. Good prices and good food. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Okay place to eat. I can only eat rice plate or the appetizer one. The others have no taste at all. I don't like the noodle. No flavor when I sip the soup. Rice recommend. Anything else please continue to look."}
{"text":"I love Asian restaurants like this.  It's a dingy hole-in-the-wall and it's SO GOOD and SO CHEAP.

I avoided coming to this place for YEARS because it's right next door to unPhogettable and that place is so hard to say no to.

One day my boyfriend insisted on trying something new and forced me to come here against my will.  I was pissed.  But then I walked in and spied with my hungry little eye this huge plate of grilled meats and got put in my place.

If this is your first time here, you HAVE to get the spring rolls with charboiled sausage.  It comes in this delightfully orange and pink shrimp paste dip and the flavors together is pure magic.  In the roll itself is a strip of deep fried wonton wrapper and creates a surprisingly pleasant crunch and great texture.

For your entree, definitely get the broken rice with 10 things because WHY NOT.  Pork? yes. Short ribs? YES! Chinese sausage? Yes yes! Deep fried roll thing with shrimp in it? Yes yes yes! AND little pieces of deep fried pork belly scattered across the plate?! AHHHHHHHHHH.

Just thinking about this meal makes me so happy.

One star down because service is quite bad.  Just prepare to flag down your waiter."}

{"text":"BEST Vietnamese Egg rolls and the pork soup with the crispy pork belly is so delicious.  They really need to change the chairs because the look terrible, but the food makes up for it.  Not your typical Vietnamese menu, lots of authentic dishes not seen in many restaurants."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. Moving from OK, I have been trying to find a good vietnamese spot that serves other foods instead of pho.  The grilled pork and beef are tender, and the eggrolls are one of the best yet I have tasted.  My friend and I were really impressed.  Will definitely come back here again."}

{"text":"Solid com tam (broken rice).  That's all I really need to say.  They have just about every variation of broken rice platter you can think of and its served as it should be.  The shredded pork is very good as well as the egg cakes and egg rolls.   They do NOT have pho.  But they do have a wide variety of bun dishes that are not as good as the com tam dishes.  Prices are great."}
{"text":"very extensive menu of different com tam dishes. they even had banh hoi, which i've only really had at home. the food itself was just ok. but, considering that i'm from CA and used to really really good vietnamese restaurants, i'm a bit biased. service is good. prices are good. i would come back."}
{"text":"I order com suong nuong yesterday for lunch today,  when I open suong nuong look black and bitter I really disappointed this restaurant bad bad"}
{"text":"Went with a Vietnamese friend who gave it a thumbs up. Their spring rolls will blow your mind. No PHO served which tells you something there..."}
{"text":"Just north of the main entrance to Mekong, Com Tam Thuan Kieu always is a good bet. The food is fantastic. No pho here; they specialize in broken rice dishes.   

    This also happens to be one of a very few places that carry shrimp paste. If you've never had this before, it is ground shrimp that is cooked wrapped around a sugar cane. It is amazing and we come here time and time again adding that to our bun.

    Those who have commented on the service here are correct, however it just appears to be cultural . Each time I come here for a to go order, I have ordered with the more westernized teenagers that work at the front. Every time they remember our favorite orders and treat us with nothing but respect and gratitude for our patronage.

     If you are a foodie and enjoy Vietnamese, I would definitely suggest you try this place out. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We drove 40 minutes to try this place because it was recommend to me by a VIetnamese friend. The ONLY reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that the place has a run down appearance.  The food was awesome. We were greeted as soon as we entered and provided with menus.  The menu is pretty expansive so it took a few minutes to read through it.  I ordered BANH HOI TOM THIT NEM NUONG (Thin vermicelli patties with charbroiled shrimp, pork and meatball) - my husband ordered BUN GA CHA GIO TOM (Chicken, shrimp, egg roll vermicelli).  The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time.  I took one bite of the pork and said \"wow, this is great\".  Everything was delicious and flavorful.  We cleaned our plates.  We also ordered hot tea which was served not in tea cups but in heavy glasses which seemed strange but it too was good.  Our total bill was $23.90.  The restaurant is small, not visually appealing, but in a good location at the entrance of Mekong Market.  So while you eat you can people watch.  They had one restroom that also appeared to serve as a storage closet and didn't seem particularly clean. I was sort of worried that the table might not be very clean, but I'd go there again because the meal was that good."}
{"text":"Ok so after giving this place a big break i have made it back and WOW, they must of read my review cause some serious changes were made! Service was excellent and the awkward water cups that i experienced before were gone away with. 

This time i went in wanting a rice dish but ended up getting a noodle dish. It was super flavorful! House Soup is what it is call but you order it \"Dry\" ya i know kinda weird but its super good, definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"I've been here two times, once a few years ago and then recently with my family.  Both times, I enjoyed my time there!  Com tam is one of my favorite types of food and both times I've had it here, it has fulfilled my craving.  I will say that the com tam in Orange County, CA and Houston, TX is a little more flavorful, a little cheaper, and overall better, but this restaurant is all I would need. 

The restaurant is located in Mekong plaza and has two entrances - one from the main parking lot and one from the Mekong supermarket.

The sliced beef, steamed egg meatloaf, rice, and pickled vegetables were great.  The fried minced shrimp with egg roll skin is also some of the best I've ever had anywhere. Some minor personal things I encountered were that the clear broth pork based soup that they give with each broken rice dish was saltier than I expected (it doesn't really cleanse the palate too well which is how I personally like it), the fish sauce could maybe be slightly sweeter, and the shredded pork skin could be flavored better.  But those personal preferences vary from person to person.

All in all, I'm happy this restaurant is in the Valley as they make a Vietnamese dish available that deserves the public awareness that pho has."}
{"text":"Okay y'all, 

Some recommendations 

1) spring rolls - the pork one  it comes with this yellow, dipping sauce and its bomb 

2) the \"com tam\" - broken rice - slice beef - and egg rolls. I think it's number 27. A solid plate and it's one you can't go wrong ordering. 

3) if you're super hungry, you can add another order of their egg noodles. The pork isn't the most tender but the broth is not bad and hits the spot after eating the rice plate. 

Basically if you're looking for a Viet place that not a pho place, this is your go to."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to get your spring roll fix?  This place has the best \"thit nuong cuon\" in the area. They use good cuts of flavorful grilled pork (instead of the standard plain boiled pork butt with lots of fat) and a crunch stick in the middle, with lots of veggies but no rice noodle filler.  I always pick up an order to go to satisfy my craving. 
Tip: try it with their \"nem nuong\" sauce. It's a warm creamy orange sauce that is a specialty of Nha Trang, a beachside city in Vietnam. It comes standard with another one of their spring rolls, the \"nem nuong cuon\". It's like crack sauce. Yum."}
{"text":"Anytime anyone talks about Vietnamese food, it's always \"Phô this, phô that...\" (Did you catch the pun?) Phô is so trendy now days, the other treasures of the Vietnamese cuisine is often overlooked, and regrettably so. 

Take a step outside of the box you're pent up in, show the waiter this picture and indulge. The second you pop one of those little mini egg rolls in your mouth you'll be sending me a message thanking me for opening up your world. 

If this place had a web domain, it would be \"vietnam.bomb.com.\""}
{"text":"I mean when it comes to rice dishes, this is the place to go in AZ! Their 7 topping plate is really good and will last you 2 meals due to it being the biggest portion ever. The shrimp egg rolls here are DELICIOUS as they roll them with rice paper instead of regular eggroll paper. The staff is warm and friendly and the service is very prompt."}
{"text":"Outstanding Vietnamese Soup (for the Americans); Pho for those in the Know. we drive down every week.  Sometimes  2 or 3 times. we love it. Amazing.  These pigs have served  an honorable end."}
{"text":"Expect no com TAM-foolery here....this joint is serious about their broken rice business! 

Endless options of different broken rice (aka com tam= deliciousness)  dishes which typically include shredded pork and whatever type of meat flavors your fancy, all within your $6-10 wallet budget! Service is prompt and efficient, menu is ez to follow, focus your energy on the broken rice dishes; thats what theyre known for. 

I highly recommend the shredded pork + pork chop + steamed egg combo that comes with a light pork broth on the side. The portion is HUGE and each component of the dish is so flavorful and unique, bringing together a fantastic symphony for your palate. My personal favorite is the steamed egg; there's just something about the soft and moist texture that compliments the broken rice. Go easy on the fish sauce (ngoc mam) they give you on the side (try adding Sriracha to the sauce to add some spice in your life), the dish is by far no means lacking in flavor/sodium. All at a pansy $5.99, I could really eat this all day...everyday!"}
{"text":"The guy is suck. I am going with my wife and baby but my baby is hungry. She don't have chance for eat then i told waiter put to go for me but he argued it. I am never come back this place. If the place still have this guy work here"}
{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese rice plate restaurant in the valley. I also love their meatball spring rolls. THE best! The big combo rice plates that cost around $15-17 are good for sharing between 2 people. Even the owner suggests to get it and share. Service here is decent.  
They are good at re-filling your water cups. When I get my to-go orders, they are still fresh and good."}
{"text":"3/29/10

Came here after work as Mom needed to do some light shopping at Mekong supermarket.  Since it was already 815p, she started grocery-shopping, while I placed an order for spring rolls, which Mom specially-requested, and a combination pho.  I've always wondered if the meatball dish was any good, so I ordered that, too.  In less than 10 minutes, our dishes were ready, so I texted Mom to come on over.

Mom didn't really enjoy the fresh rolls- she only had half of one, and the other sat in the fridge for three days until I tossed it out.  We also didn't enjoy the meatball platter.  What a waste!  Terrible presentation (unflattering color- could've used some searing action to give the slices a nice crust), horrid texture (clammy/rubbery), and very bland in flavor.  Two bites, and I wondered who would ever order this again?  Not us!  Thankfully, the pho saved the evening!  That is, until it became quite clear, from the heightened energy levels of the cleaning crew, that they were anxious to close for the evening.  We were trying to eat as fast as we could, until I finally looked at my watch and noted it was only 8:45p!  What the...?  Then I remembered that the last time we were there, we were treated the same way, too, but it was understandable, since it was closer to 9p then.

Sorry, Com Tam, but lackluster spring rolls, ghastly meatball dish, and rushing us when there was still plenty of time are two reasons too many not to come back!"}
{"text":"No frills and excellent food, solid Vietnamese staple, super quick, and cheap. Really can't think of what not to like about this authentic spot. I'd eat here regularly if I were to live in Phoenix. Try the sample platter if you don't know what to order. It feeds two."}
{"text":"Any of the broken rice dishes are really good!"}
{"text":"Sister in law took us out here while we were visiting Scottsdale. Food was really good and prices reasonable. Service seemed OK although my wife said one of the workers was quite rude to one of his coworkers. But toi khong hieu Vietnamese. 

In any respect I'd come back again as the com tam dac biet was really good."}
{"text":"I have really mixed reviews about this place. 

Firstly, their service isn't the greatest and I'll explain why. My sister and mother ordered two to-go dishes. They opened it to a really spoiled smell and they asked them to remake the dish. They refused. My mother then asked if they can just switch out the meat that was spoiled on top, THEY STILL REFUSED. They kept claiming it wasn't soiled. Did they smell it? NO. They didn't accommodate us so my sister and mother left WITH SPOILED FOOD. Outrageous.

THEN, one day the server got my order wrong. I don't understand Vietnamese so the server told my mother I ORDERED IT WRONG. Like are you joking? I had to pressure my mom to see what he said and he literally blamed his mistake on me. I wanted to go and tell his boss but my mother told me not to make it a big deal. The server blamed his mistake on me- I deserve to be mad. 

Water is never given when I go. I have to constantly ask. 

They will never remake your order if they get it wrong and will blame you in order to prevent getting in trouble by their boss. I don't think the boss wants to deal with it either to be honest. 

Food is alright but the only reason I go here is because my mother makes us eat here when I go to Mekong. I honestly would rather not come due to the extremely crappy service. The service outweighs the food. Not to mention, they raised all their prices.

Upon writing this, they gave the wrong to-go order to a customer. Awful service."}
{"text":"One of the best Vietnamese restaurants in AZ for sure! This is our family's go-to restaurant whenever we are craving \"broken rice\" or happen to be on the east side. 

This is probably my mom's favorite place to eat regardless of the occasion. She's asked to come here for everything. Her birthday, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, etc. My mom is one of THE pickiest eaters I have EVER encountered, and if she likes a certain restaurant...that says A LOT!

The service is always good here. Much better than most Asian restaurants in AZ. I'm pretty sure I've had the same waiter everytime I've been there and he's always been great!

I always get the Com Tam Bi Suon Cha Tau Hu Ky and it's never disappointed. When I'm feeling like a little fatty, I'll do the 7 Mon /\"All 7\" and basically pay a little more to try a little bit of everything. That also means that I have to come with an empty stomach because...it's a whole lot of food!

 I wouldn't suggest doing the 10 Mon/\"All10\" unless you were planning to either share it or take leftovers home. Their portions are rediculously large! 

The pork chop is always grilled just right and their food flavoring is very consistent for the most part. Sometimes the broth is a little saltier than others, but for me...that doesn't really matter because I like the extra kick! :)

You can always ask them for a little bit of boiled water to make it less salty if you want. 

This is a Vietnamese restaurant you don't want to pass up if you're ever in town. I know I don't. :p"}
{"text":"My favorite place for broken rice dishes. I always order #14. Probably one of the best egg rolls in Arizona. Service is always good."}
{"text":"The food is just average. Customer service is just average as well. Anyway, you can't expect that much in a Vietnamese restaurant. One time I had a waiter who tried to jump in our conversations. He sat next to our table using his phone. The only plus is their huge dish portion."}
{"text":"Service is fast and efficient, food is excellent. I wish they would stop walking away when you are trying to finish your order. Stand still, SMILE and listen to your customers who have chosen to spend their hard earned money at your business!"}
{"text":"Best nem nuong cuon in the valley..  sometimes they give a lot a lot of pork sausage but i don't complain, except that it fills me up to where i can't eat my main course =)  The sauce is amazing, definitely a must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Com Tam Thuan Kieu, I mean if you can pronounce it, is a Vietnamese old school restaurant! Simple, but yet sweet to the point! If you know your Vietnamese basic dishes it won't disappoint! It's also won't hurt your wallet! It's in the Mekong plaza in Mesa; what better place than in a Asia Supermarket plaza! All your Asian needs, I usually start off with the crispy spring rolls (egg rolls) and or pho or vermacilli noodle bowl which is a bowl with the noodles some selections come with half egg rolls in your bowl and the choice of meat , beef, pork, and so forth! I think they are known for their bang xeo which for 6 dollars is pretty amazing for the plate you can at least share it with 3 people!"}
{"text":"Came with my Vietnamese coworker and friend.  He orders in Vietnamese.  I order using the system by which each dish has a unique number.  The specialty of the house is the fifty or so broken rice dishes and my lunch companion and I decided that \"Com Tam something something\" shall be known as \"Broken Rice\" because the actual name is unpronounceable by most Americans and there is already a restaurant in the lunch rotation known as the Vietnamese place.  Did I mention that the coconut water comes in an actually coconut?  Spoon included.  If the large portions don't fill you up, you can gnaw on the coconut meat.

Broken Rice is located next to the entrance of the Mekong Grocery Store opposite UnPHOgettable.  One of the two opted for the American friendly name; both seem authentic to someone who has never set foot in Vietnam, but I did get a peek at the country when I was in Thailand.  One has pho, the other, broken rice, which is about a third the size of regular rice.  Wikipedia says broken rice may or may not be less nutritious than regular rice and that it is less expensive.  My Vietnamese friend says it is less common in Vietnam, and thus fancier, but I can't figure out why.  The main difference is the texture and not the taste, not that I really noticed.  In any case, I recommend all of the broken rice dishes.

I had whatever was suggested by the waiter in lieu of what I ordered, Vietnamese friend not required when ordering.  It had shrimp egg rolls and beef with a heap of broken rice and some veggies.  Soup and a small bowl of fish sauce arrived before the meal.  My Vietnamese friend added some chilly sauce to the fish sauce and spooned some of the mixture onto his meal.  I followed suite.  All in all, I look forward to returning and trying some other numbers."}
{"text":"This place was very good! I've been to there many locations in ca and this location is comparable if not better. I ordered their nem nuong cuon and a rice plate! Their crab sauce is really good, you could actually taste the seafood in the sauce. Their rice plate was nicely presented. I ordered the rice with shrimp egg rolls and short ribs. Their egg rolls are soooo good, super crispy! Service was prompt, my water cup was always filled! I will be returning whenever I am in town."}
{"text":"This tiny Vietnamese cafe, for although it has a restaurant menu it is really laid out like a cafe, and not exactly luxurious, is pretty amazing. Their food is so authentic it is like actually being in Saigon. No, I have not been to Saigon but when I want to pretend I am there I visit Com Tam at Mekong Plaza. Since I am a seafood fanatic and no longer in love with red meat, I am less in love with UnPhogettaable which is right next door, since they don't have a great seafood \"Pho\"\" selection. Pho is actually based on beef buillon n the strictest sense of the word, so calling it seafood pho is something of a misnomer, but I can thoroughly recommend #105 from Com Tam if you like seafood. It includes shrimp, pieces of catfish fillet, a cheap but delicious fish, and squid. Don't discount the squid if you have never had it, try it first because it is very good and not at all suidgy as is it sounds. Their combo broken rice dishes are also excellent and most dishes average $8 - $11, so you are not going to break the bank. I eat here a couple of times every week, so maybe I will see you there!! Remember, when you see the natives eating at a restaurant  it is always a very good sign and at Com Tam you can sometimes have trouble getting a table because it is filled with Vietnamese people all eating at this favourite restaurant."}
{"text":"I had their Bo luc lac.  Not impressed, the flavor was really off.  Maybe this is because grew up in the San Gabriel Valley and lived near Garden Grove for 2 years.  But all in all I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I have only gotten the cafe sua da (iced coffee) here but it's the best I have had yet. When you walk in there is always fresh coffee lined up in cups on the counter ready to be mixed with sweetened condensed milk. I don't get to Mesa often but when I do I go here for the wonderful, rich, dark and creamy coffee. This is strong stuff; that first sip is so good. The richness, full flavor, creamy caramel flavors are heavenly.  And as the ice melts, it mellows out the flavor a little and it's still great. I can't say I have had all the cafe sua da in the valley, but what I have had; this is my favorite. 

Next time I come to Mesa for work I will need to come at lunch time so I can try the pho."}

 We ordered the shrimp spring rolls and pork  filled rolls. They shrimp spring rolls were fresh and went well  with the peanut sauce. We enjoyed the Vermicelli bowl with cha gio egg roll and marinated pork. Everything we ordered came out perfectly. I hope they don't change anything. This place is the best for their grilled meats that we have tried in AZ so far! Whenever I get a craving for a noodle bowl or spring rolls I'll come here!"}

I took this to go for school.

The food was ready in less than ten minutes.

Fair pairs, lots of things on the menu to choose from. I've been here about 5 times. They have soup, vermicelli bowls, appetizers, rich dishes and so on.

FYI, this is a Vietnamese restaurant, but they do not have pho on the menu. You have to go next door to Unphogettable. I'm not sure why they don't have it.

Service is okay. Nothing that blows my mind. The owners are just not so welcoming. But the food is good."}
{"text":"I came here with my parents for lunch one day. This restaurant didn't have any of our Americanized favorites (aka Pho lol) but it didn't matter we got some of our other favorites and tried a couple new noodle dishes. 

I ordered Bun Bo Hue. It was okay. The broth lacked flavor and that nice red color that I am used to. The noodles looked like I got the end of the package or something, each noodle was less than 2 inches long! It made it so difficult to eat with chopsticks!! But on the plus side, they gave a good amount of meat 

I tasted tasted the udon. The noodles were chewy and the soup was SO SALTY!! 

I wish I looked at the other reviews before I came here, looks like rice is the way to go. But defiantly the noodles were a bit below par.

I will be back, The old man that runs the place seems overwhelmed trying to help but not helping. a party of 4 walked out, and one guy questioned his check. I was told on the phone not to order on phone, and to come in, which I happily chose to  do cuz they are right next to Mekong market , and Mangosteens are in season.  I am very happy I didn't order grub hub, they charge 5.99 or 6.99 to deliver.  I feel like I got 7 bucks off my bill and mangosteen's win win!"}

Also, service is A1! They are very attentive and I was never left with an empty drink. I definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for authentic Vietnamese food. You will not be disappointed."}

I got a Seafood H Tiu dish, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Not the best I have ever had by any means, but still pretty good.  My only real qualm was the lack of fish balls which normally accompany a seafood Ph/H Tiu.  

I know that the fish balls are more of a fusion (Thai/Chinese) cuisine, but whether it is just an Americanized version of the dish that includes them, I really missed them in this dish."}

I'm from California and the ones I've had in CA tastes much different. The fish porridge was good when it was hot. People were super nice though."}
{"text":"Only place I know in the valley that has Nem Nuong Cuon Nha Trang Style.  It's not the best I've had but if your craving that special sauce, this place will suffice.  If you've been to Orange County in Cali, you probably know about Brodard.  Their Nem Nuong Cuon is the gold standard.  Well this place doesn't make it quite that good, but it's pretty good none the less.  The Nem itself is not that flavorful but the sauce makes up for it."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service excellent good I was so full. I. Can't wait to come back to Mesa for more food you guys made me and my partner feel very welcome and the food was amazing I will be back and I think it's a new place id see myself going to and telling friends about ."}
{"text":"This is a simple food kiosk in the food court it shares.  My wife and I ordered Hu Tiu Nam Vang.  It was good.  My wife, who is Vietnamese, was pleasantly surprised.  Though the food can not be compared to what is in Vietnam, it is good.  My wife was surprised.  

FYI:  It appears that this place is run by a person who is affiliated with the Hung's Hair Design around the corner just off the food court.  It appears to be of the same family.  The person taking my order recognized me as I have had him as my hairstylist at Hung's Hair Design."}
{"text":"After being in Texas for the past few months coming back here flooded my tongue with so many great memories. The egg rolls were pure bliss just as i remembered. The vermicelli with beef and shrimp paste was very good. They never cease to amaze me!"}
{"text":"I am a regular here. Great place in you like special Vietnamese rice plate with fusion Asian and French cuisine.   The serving were so huge that it turns out to be TWO meals for me and they were gracious every time I eat there.  Once you become a regular, they will always treat you very nicely.  This is a place to take your date especially if this person rarely eat Asian food and a nice introduction but NOT too over the top.  The bed of the rice place is served with special blend of rice (broken rice) which required extra effort to cook with no extra charge."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at Com Tam Thuan Kieu. I was expecting your traditional pho (Vietnamese) restaurant. They do not have the traditional pho. They do have wonderful assortments of Vietnamese wraps like egg rolls, and crepes as well as other noodle dishes (more seafood) and rice plates. 

I ordered bbq pork combo rice plate. It was large portion with lots of flavor. My son ordered the egg noodle beef meatball soup. Nothing like the regular pho but delicious regardless. 

The best dish we had today was the egg rolls. It's not the traditional flour wrapped ones though. I believe it is rice flour wrapping which gave it a nice crunch. The fillings were abundant and really tasted every ingredient inside. Highly recommend the egg rolls! 

The service was prompt. Food came out fast. Water was never less than half full. Will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Three for lunch. Ordered family style, big appetizer sampler platter, then #21, meat and broken rice platter.
 A large delicious marinated and grilled bone in pork chop was split 3 ways.
Crispy egg rolls, and grilled shrimp were my favorites. Mound of rice, with grilled sausages, 
Beef rolled up, shrimp paste cakes.
Too many items to mention, but also included a 
small bowl of soup.
Service was good, seemed like father and son, and they were very nice.
Finished with a couple of spring rolls. Nice and fresh!
We'll be back. Good value, and delicious, interesting food.
After lunch you need to shop in the supermarket!!!!"}
