{"text":"I'm a fan of this place. It's cheap and a good place to go to when you have a late night hankering since it's open 24 hours. I like the California burrito and their chicken tacos; they're not as greasy as some of the other places I've tried. Their cheap beef tacos aren't bad and I do like their french fries. It's good a good place with good food and I come back here whenever the mood strikes."}
{"text":"This restaurant makes me happy about mexican food, it's not fake Mexican food like the filbertos across the street. they have the best Mexican food in town and really nice customer service they are nice and the food there is unbelievably good. They make the food how u want it if u want pollo asado fries instead of Carne asada they can do that. If I were to get captured by isis and if they told me I could have one last meal and it could be what ever I wanted I would say chipotle, but amados would be a very close second.  If you want quality Mexican food go to amados"}
{"text":"So delish.  Perfect fast authentic, no nonsense Mexican food.  Affordable."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best Fili-B's type place in the Phoenix Metro area... This is it. You can pretty much order anything and be happy with it. I have been eating there for about 10 years now and have never gotten sick(except for when I ate too much). Some might say eating shrimp in the desert is risky. This is the only place I eat shrimp. Their Shrimp burrito add cheese minus the tartar sauce is amazing! Their carne asada fries are pretty good too! I have tried almost everything on the menu except for the Menudo."}
{"text":"Amado's is fantastic. I used to work next door to the McClintock location, so I ate there almost daily. I was delighted to find out about the Alma School location. I like my food fairly simple, and this is it. Taquitos are nothing but beef, with cheese and guacamole on top. Breakfast burritos are potato, egg, cheese, and bit of bacon. The hot sauce is great. So, if you want something just like Fili B's, only better, come to Amado's. Oh, did I mention that they're open 24 hrs?"}
{"text":"This place is terrible save your money go across the street and eat Taco Bell. They can never get the order right and it's hit or miss if they burn the tortillas over fry the rolled tacos. Good luck with this"}
{"text":"The upside. Amados is cheap and open in the middle of the night. The condiments are tasty, if not always well stocked. The rellenos are greasy, but satisfying. Everything I have tried has been heavy on the salt. Ultimately, I would characterize it as a \"where can we pick something up\" kind of joint. There are a lot of better places than Amados, but not at 4 in the morning."}
{"text":"amados is great.   cheap, clean. yes clean.... look at the health rating.. and good    most people dont remember when the buildin was a circle k....  i seriously have eated here over 3000 times while growing up.  after the remodeled it lost some of its uumph. a bit more expensive too.. but its still great  great place to watch a nightly fight after 1am too...."}
{"text":"Not great! I don't live in Arizona anymore but am visiting and am staying in mesa. I've personally always been a fan of juliobertos but didn't feel like making the drive tonight. Headed to this place and it was OK. I got the super nachos and they were not at all as impressive as Julio's but still a decent size for the price. Didn't seem as fresh and homemade as what I'm used to. This was more filbertos style which I'm not a fan of.."}
{"text":"I want to love this place so bad, but they KEEP SCREWING UP our order!!! You tell them you want green salsa. How many? 3. You get home and you have 3 red. Just now my husband ordered me nachos with NO sour cream (I can't eat dairy) and extra guacamole. She repeated \"no guacamole extra sour cream?\" No. No sour cream extra guacamole. He pulls up to window. She says \"nachos with no guacamole and extra sour cream right?\". NO. Nachos with NO sour cream extra guacamole. He gets home and guess what. That's right. Covered in sour cream. I can't eat my food. So he has to go back.  Language barrier?  They don't care? Dumb? I'm not sure. But it's frustrating to not get what you paid for the first time. Food is pretty dang good for price. If you can get in habit of investigating your food, salsas etc before you drive off then your golden."}
{"text":"I've only ever been one place that does what Amados does better than Amados does it. Cheap, delicious Mexican food that is available at any time you can dream of eating Mexican food.   This isn't a place to go when you're looking for astronomical levels of quality; this is a place to go when you want solid food in big quantities for good prices at unreasonable hours. The Arizona burrito is awesome, the carne asada is awesome, the carnitas are awesome, and the rest is a step below but still good. I'm not a huge fan of the rolled tacos, but you may see it differently. The guacamole isn't great, either, but the hot sauce is pretty darn good so I don't really mind.  If you want cheap and convenient, this is your best bet, over the other competitors in the area. If you want more of a sit-down place to bring someone, you can find something else. Your call.  And don't wimp out and talk English here. The cooks are super friendly and talkative if you're just willing to use that kid-level Spanish you learned in middle school, no matter how gringo your accent is."}
{"text":"If any place reminds me of my high school days (other than my high school itself), it's definitely Amados. Located right down from Marcos de Niza, it's a student hotspot for lunch time and after school! And being a 24-hour restaurant, it's great for a bite any time of the day. They offer seating outside as well which is lovely when the weather is nice!   Even better news? On top of their already great prices for whopping meals, they offer a free bean or egg and potato burrito with any purchase over $7!"}
{"text":"Amado's is Bien By The Rue  Amado's you are bien, I am not afriad to say so, You're not quite muy bien, But no one has to know.  The Amado's platter, Is a lot of food and cheap, For breakfast it doesn't matter, Eggs, burros or a bag of peeps.  Before when you spent eight, They gave you a free burrito, The prices are still great, Some might even say paquito.  Even though Fili B's is across the street, It's you who I prefer and choose, Even though your prices can be beat, With you my stomach will never lose.   Finishedalitoamos"}
{"text":"I'm a regular visitor here for good value, tasty mexican food. The whole menu is good. I've had breakfast here too and they make a filling, satisfying breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Although the burrito was delicious, the salsa wasn't even salsa, just hot sauce with water. Ontop of that, I've lost 15lbs in two days from food poisoning because of this place. It definitely isn't the same as it used to be. This will be my last trip to Amados unfortunately."}
{"text":"It's a good, clean, quick Mexican food joint. Meals are generally $6, excluding the drink. I remember having the cravings for some of their hard tacos, and having to go get some at 3am. Pretty convenient when it's open late. Overall, good place. Try their burrito-taco combo."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The food is usually ok. However, They have a bunch of lewd, pornographic stickers posted all around the drive thru area. I've brought this to their attention a few times and they brushed me off. I will not be back. I generally have my kids with me and wont subject them to that kind of inappropriateness."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food, their shrimp tacos are amazing!! And they are open 24/7!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Ohio and let me tell you, I wish I could fight over which Mexican shack was the best.  Amados does a lot of stuff right and once you have to live without it, you realize how awesome it really is.  I would give my left nut for a breakfast burrito or machaca plate!  Don't ever take it for granted."}
{"text":"Food is good, but not exceptional. If you want Mexican fast-food, there are better places. However, Amado's fits the bill if you drive by this location. The burros are good; I would say they are great if they ever reduce salt content on their meat; lime and salsa take care of this though. The rolled tacos are really good, just make sure to get them with cheese and guacamole. Service is fast and the staff is courteous. You should know that the place needs a remodel if you plan to eat there."}
{"text":"The BEST Carne Asada Nachos ever. Tons of meat and avocado and cheese.  We have never had a bad meal here, we've tried a bunch of the breakfast type burritos (hey, hangover food) and regular burritos, but we always go back for the Carne Asada Nachos when we feel the need to splurge."}
{"text":"I also love me some Amado's when I want some tasty fast Mexican food.  The size of the burritos is ridiculous, particularly given the price you pay.  The Arizona burrito never fails to satisfy that Mexican food craving that I seem to have on a near-daily basis.  Carne asada, potato chunks, and pico de gallo wrapped in a huge tortilla.  As a matter of fact, I think I'll go over there right now."}
{"text":"Not only was my order screwed up (apparently burrito can be misheard as taco), when it was fixed I eventually find two large chunks of bone in the burrito. I used to really like this place for a quick bite but I'm done."}
{"text":"First visit. Carne Asada burrito was very good. The tortilla had the freshly homemade taste, like nana use to make. You Mexicans out there know what I mean.  The meat was tender and marinated very well. My boy liked the quesadilla, but how can you mess that up right?  My other son got the machaca burro. He said it was good. It must have been cuz the next thing I know, it was gone. The red sauce was okay...a little watery for my taste.  I'll be back again."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for about two years now maybe twice a month and after some late night activities. What really stands out to me is their carne asada fries and how they got rid of a new years hangover. They offer quick service, a salsa/condiment bar, huge menu and excellent meat. This is not your neighborhood Filibertos. The only reason I give it 4/5 stars and not 5/5 is we need a drive through!!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here 3 times a week (drive-thru).  The hot sauce is fantastic! It's Mexican fast food, so expect it. Open 24 hours and has a drive-thru. Don't bother eating in - the setting really leaves something to be desired - and unlike it's nearby Tempe location, it is big and rather empty, even when the drive-thru line is out to Alma School. Bean tostada, Carne Asada burrito, guac taquitos, some of our mainstays.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years! They always make me exactly what I ask for with no problems whatsoever. I don't eat dairy so I get a burro with no cheese. Just beans and rice. Sounds easy but most places manage to screw it up...not Amado's tho. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Let's start with a little history about the building. At least, how I remember it. A long time ago, the building which currently houses Amado's was simply a Circle K / Seven 11 convenience store. I can't remember which, I was merely a child back then. I think around the time I was in junior high, maybe fifteen years ago, it became one of those \"-bertos\" type restaurants and opened under the name \"Armandos\". My dad took me there for lunch sometimes on Saturdays and it was great. Eventually, the place closed for a brief period of time and reopened exactly the same as it was before, except now with one less letter in the name. \"Armando's dropped the R and became \"Amando's\". Maybe new owners/management took over? I don't know. Not too much later it closed once again for a brief period of time and then reopened, this time down yet another letter in the name.   So, \"Amado's\" was born. I'm guessing you won't find a dude named Amado in the back making your tacos. This current and longest running iteration has seen an expanded dining room(a fairly large remodeled stock room that used to be completely walled off from the restaurant) which includes a salsa bar and a large Mexican mural on the wall.  I like this place. I always have. I always argued it was better than all of the other little Mexican joints in Phoenix and the surrounding cities. The \"new breakfast burrito\" or \"Amado's breakfast burrito\", as I think they call it now, has always been my go-to meal. Somewhere down the line they introduced \"Amado's(Carne Asada) Fries\" and those would occasionally supplement the burrito when I placed my order.  Something changed, though. Over the years, there has been a serious increase in the amount of people under twenty-two that frequent this place. In fact, I'd wager that's the majority of their business after 6 PM. This often makes the place not so much fun to visit at night and late hours, which was always my favorite time to go.  Unfortunately, my dear Amados does not have a drive-thru. You know who does, though? That Filberto's that is right across the street in the Fry's plaza. So, these days, I usually just settle for second best at night.  As I said, I like this place. But as the old guy that is now pushing thirty, after dark, I feel like I'm seconds away from being called a \"fag\" and having a soda thrown at my face when I'm waiting for my food among all of the drunken and loud kids running around Amado's dining room."}
{"text":"Watered down sales. Inside smells greasy.... waste of $$ and time"}
{"text":"I am in love with amados! Highly recommend their food and I love their staff! Best place for a hang over meal! You will not be dissappointed!"}
{"text":"I ordered a carne asada burrito and a beef taco here around 3pm on a weekday. The beef taco was pretty good, the cheese was fresh and the lettuce tasted clean.   However, the carne asada burrito was not good, I tried covering it up with salsa,  still not good. The steak was burnt looking, maybe it had been sitting for awhile. I don't recommend the steak for anything.  The new breakfast burrito is tasty as long as they do not burn the eggs. This place is hit or miss."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm not the one to write reviews but I really wanted to share my experience. JOSE at alma school location was amazing. I had a horrible experience at McClintock and Guadalupe location. They had messed up my carne asada fries and I called back immediately and talked with Phillipe who was really kind and told me he wrote my name down and that my food would be replaced. I went back today and the drive thru girl refused to give me my replacement because I did not have my food or receit. Phillipe failed to tell me I needed to bring these items and didn't even give me a receit (but not baggin on him at all) I explained this to the drive thru girl and she told me \"its common sense to bring your food back\" No honey, it's not. I worked as an assiant manager at a fast food chain and worked as a regular employee at many fast food restaurants and we never question the customers. She refused to call her manager and told me to come back when he was here. Very frustrated at this point I went home and called the Alma School location to see if this was just how every location was and talked to Jose and he took my complaint and genuinely apologized for how I was treated. He offered to replace my meal at his location even though my problem wasn't at his store. Jose was very professional on handling everything and I could tell he truely cares about his customers and his line of work. Thank you Jose! From now on I'm driving the extra 4 miles to come to this location."}
{"text":"I have been a repeat customer for years. Not a visibly high class place, but always seems to be clean and the staff are friendly. It is a reliable and consistent place to grab a meal."}
{"text":"BAM MOFO!!! I'm drunk! 2000 instant calories and 60 grams of  fat wrapped up in a piping hot tortilla sounds perfect! Oh but make sure you drench that sweet \"new breakfast burrito\" in as much hot sauce as you can. Make a little pocket in the filling and pool up some spicy goodness!  In all honesty, since high school I only feel that way after a bottle of whiskey or two. That's a good thing, because if I had continued my eating habits from when I was seventeen I would be freaking dead. hard. Plus, there are a few more places that I'm willing to go to and stretch the wallet a little more for some decent food, not to mention better atmosphere. I see screaming bro's and ho's often enough, but trying to eat at the mecca of the bro world is like trying to eat while VH1's Tool Academy is turned on high volume.   I'm not saying I don't appreciate you, Amado's, but I'm just ready to start seeing other people. You don't even have a drive-thru. Jerk."}
{"text":"I love this place Great Mexican food at a great price their carnitas burrito is so good"}
{"text":"This is a fun little taco shop; prices are good and food is good. A great late night munchies spot. I enjoy their salsa bar, they have all the traditional fixings for you to help yourself to. It's a bit on the cheaper side but pretty good overall."}
{"text":"One of the best hole-in-the-wall Mexican places in the East Valley. I've had the rolled tacos, the burritos, the breakfast burritos, and this heart-attack-in-the-making carne asada on chips thing.. but oh my god, its all just delicious. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"So I don't come here by choice really. Or rather, if I'm coming here for food I either somehow lost track of time and it's now one of the ONLY options in the same zip code or I got talked into it by a friend - after last call somewheres. This place gets really weird after midnight. I've seen drunken older women totally hit on the guy at the cash register - quite entertaining. Oh yeah - the food. There's food. I usually get either the carnitas plate or a carnitas burrito. Pretty good valuewise especially if you get the combo including drink. I'd say the carnitas here is a lot tastier then at the nearby 'berto's. They also have those fifty cent sticker machines that sell wacky stickers. I got one that says Butterface in the shape of a butterfingers bar - good times! Lotsa parking. Open all dang nite..."}
{"text":"Not my favorite, but when in a pinch- I'd take Amados over Filly-B's any day. They probably use lard even though they say they don't and their horchata never tastes right to me. But sometimes a girl's just drunk and needs some friggin' CARNE ASADA FRIES."}
{"text":"This place is yum and a many steps up from filiberteos.  There carne asada fries, nachos, and rolled tacos are delicious.   Plus they are open 24 hours so it's perfect."}
{"text":"The Best place to get Menudo!  The Carne Asada Tacos are Great too!  Open 24 hours a day!  My stop for a quick yummy Mexican food fix!"}
{"text":"In a vacuum, this place would only get 3 or 4 stars. But, when comparing it to similar places, I have to give Amado's a full, five-star rating. Great burritos, chili rellenos, and they know how to do a fish taco the right way. Far superior to any of the fill-in-the-berto's."}
{"text":"Ok I forgive them for messing up my last order bc it's back to normal and beyond good now"}
{"text":"The quantities are huge!   Wow.  And, the food is great.  And the prices are reasonable.  And great service.  I don't think I could ask for more!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a good down home mexican, Amado's is the place to go. They have a 24 hour drive threw and are always speedy. I'm constantly getting breakfast burritos from here, and it's great for getting a good breakfast to start the day. They also have the best deal on carne asada fries in town!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Love the Chorizo Burrito!! But.....the staff is less than friendly and the hours of operation varies. It's seems they show up in the morning and close whenever they feel like it. One day they might open at  7 am, the next day 7:50 am, then the next day 7:30, etc."}
{"text":"First off - 6022 S. McClintock is apparently their address, although this is a little north of where Amados actually is.  Amados is on the west side of McClintock just a tad north of Guadalupe.  There's a sign out near the street, so it shouldn't be too hard to find.  So what is Amados?  A Mexican joint that's open 24/7 and seriously has some of the best Mexican food you can find.  The carne asada is so so so good, the chile relleno burrito is AWESOME (and I believe it's veggie-friendly for you vegetarian folks out there), their fish tacos are delicious...I could go on and on.  $8 will get you two carne asada burritos, which is a *lot* of food.  They also have a little condiment bar that has excellent red and green salsa, limes, cucumbers, jalapenos, and a bunch of other stuff you might be interested in.  There's a surprisingly decent amount of indoor seating, and there's a little bit of outdoor seating as well.  Amados is basically amazing - I seriously go here at least once a week.  One of the coolest parts is unlike Filiberto's and a bunch of the other taco shops nearby, a trip to Amados won't result in you spending the rest of your day sitting on a toilet.  I've been eating here for years and have yet to get even slightly sick from their food, which is impressive for a 24-hour taco shop.  One warning - late at night (meaning midnight and later), this place can get extremely shady and packed full of people you probably don't want to be around.  During daylight hours though, everything's always very mellow here.  And don't be worried if you don't speak Spanish - the staff here speaks excellent English and is very helpful."}
{"text":"My fiance and I started going to Amado's after our favorite Filiberto's went down hill.  This location has amazing food, good prices, and very courteous staff. We are lucky that this place exists, it is a far greater representation of Mexican food than any Filiberto's could hope to be.  What once was Fili-Friday for us is now Amado's Friday!"}
{"text":"Four years later, I'm back!  Felt almost like a pilgrimage back to burrito heaven or something.  Nothing but joy filled my body knowing I'd be coming here again after traveling across the pacific ocean and through miles and miles of cactus filled desert.   Visiting AZ for a wedding so my girlfriend and I was here for a few days so Amados was definitely on our hit list!    Oh how I wish Hawaii had late night Mexican spots like you.  This visit made me realize just how important places like you are in my life.    Of the four nights in AZ, we ate here three times.  Such quality burritos we just don't see in Hawaii.  And these burritos were no slouch either...these things came packed with carne asada....and for only 6 dollar-ish!  That same burrito would cost 10+ here.   Til next time, Amados.  Sigh."}
{"text":"My favorite thing in the world is a good bean and cheese burrito with guacamole and hot sauce -- and Amados NAILS IT! This is exactly what you want in Mexican comfort food. Clean, open kitchen and friendly staff. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Went here for late night hunger pangs but was disappointed with the quality for the price. Wasn't worth feeling crappy later"}
{"text":"thank you for being open when we need you. your food is delicious and the red sauce makes me happy/!  i'd like you better if there was a drive thru."}
{"text":"Way better than any -ertos in the valley. The cooks are clean and the sauces are out of bounds. I'm a fan of the chicken taco, boiled with peppers and onions. Perfect and real. Family owned and operated. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"So if you just want a big fat yummy buritto then this is your spot. Also have ordered the chimi combo which is super tasty and a LOT of food. Went here and the special says spend 10 bucks and get a free egg and potato burrito. So dinner and breakfast?? Who knew?"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos ever! It's all about their red sauce!!!! Don't know about the rest of the food. Never had it. LOL!"}
{"text":"Horrible, consistently getting my order wrong. Adding things I don't ask for on simple burritos, like a half lb of carrots& beans on chorizo burro when I asked for rice and cheese to be added. Have found plastic in horchata. Overall horrible attention to detail save your money and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I do not know what is happening lately here at this restaurant. Prices have jumped up, and the quality is going down hill fast. It appears they are using a frozen onion and bell pepper blend now. It does not grill right, and stays very wet. I had over 3oz of water leak out of my burrito tonight. What a mess, and the taste was meh.  I asked to speak to the manager and was told he only works in the morning."}
{"text":"I love their breakfast burritos. They're pretty fast, too, going through the drive through. The red sauce is good, but I prefer their green."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I LOVE mexican food!  I eat it at least once or twice a week.  I have had the pleasure of enjoying many home-cooked mexican dishes with my mexicano friends and I have traveled deep into the heart of Mexico experiencing many different flavors and styles of mexican food.  My love affair with mexican food is well-developed.  To be quite frank, the food at Amado's is BLAND for the norteño style.  Especially when compared to Filiberto's, which probably explains the usual Amados crowd.  This place is always packed with drunk highschool and ASU jocks every Friday and Saturday night, complete with the occasional highschool spar that draws police.  So the late night bar crowd should beware, this place is a night in jail waiting to happen.  This is why they have security cameras aimed right at you as you order.  The best thing going for this place is the little salsa bar.  I am staying loyal to the near by Filiberto's which is much more relaxed, more flavorful and has a drive-thru."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently good and consistently cheap...  Good stuff..."}
{"text":"When you want Mexican and you're in a hurry, this place seems a step above the average quick all night Filibertos food out there.   So I end up here at least once a month, when I want a serious meat meal."}
{"text":"It seems like over the last two weeks for the quality of the food here has gone down drastically.  In the last two weeks of down there four times and every time the carne asada was crunchy and old."}
{"text":"This place was just ok. The salsa bar was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Amado's is pretty great for the price and availability.  They are open 24 hours, nearly every day in the year.  The food is what you would expect from a divey Mexican fast food place, but it's miles better than Filiberto's.  The best items are the rolled tacos, carne asada burrito, carne asada quesadilla, bean burrito w/ cheese (best ever), sausage breakfast burrito, and the Amado's breakfast burrito.  And of course the hot sauce!  The only serious downside is that both the Dobson and the McClintock locations are right next to high schools.  If you end up needing a midnight burrito, you'll likely encounter a troup of drunk high school kids.  All in all, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"$18 for carne asada taco plate and carne asada burrito with 2 drinks. Rice & beans were bland. Meat was greasy with no seasoning. Dirty bathrooms. YUCK!"}
{"text":"I'm very picky when it comes to fast food Mexican.  It can be simple but it has to be good.  This place had very  matter of fact service.  The food was done in a quick time frame but it just wasn't that cheap or that good to bother going back to.  Ordered a bean and cheese burrito with potato added to it.  The tortilla was delicious.  It smelled and tasted fresh made.  However it was a bit burned.  Then the beans were very average with thick shreds of cheddar cheese.  The potatoes were gross in my opinion.  They were very big chunks of breakfast style potatoes with lots and lots of pepper.  I am not a fan of pepper.  Also ordered the 5 rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole.  My children did not care for the \"meat\" in the middle.  The guacamole was a bit sour tasting.  I did like that the tacos were thickly rolled.  The outside was super crisp and the inside mushy.  That appealed to me....  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I travel a lot and happened to be in the area and went here for a quick bite. It was great! Had the carne asada chips and a flan and they were really good. Would definitely go back. People were super nice and it was pretty busy. A definite keeper in my travel restaurants!"}
{"text":"This place has great food at reasonable prices. There food never makes me ill and that says a lot since I just had surgery. They give you a lot for your money. I can mke 4 meals out of their #8 combo."}
{"text":"Personally, this is my favorite cheap Mexican go-to eatery for when I'm on the go. Their prices are mostly on point, the food is always hot, and they are quick. The only thing I don't like is that a small side of sour cream is $1.05 which I think is a bit over priced, especially for the amount given. But I'd choose Amados over Filibertos any day."}
{"text":"One of those great local Mexican restaurants that those in Tempe are lucky to have.  The food is great, quickly made and everything is clean.  There are some shady characters outside so I'm not sure I'd bring my son by after lunch, but the food is worth the effort."}
{"text":"I had a friend come in from out of town and I wanted him to have the best/authentic Mexican food.  I asked a friend who lives in and is from Tempe, where I could take my out of town friend to get such food.  He said \"Amados\".  Since I trust this friends taste in food, I trusted he was right.  Ohhhh was he wrong.  First there is only like 4 parking spots, and the drive-thru would be hard to maneuver thru if the parking lot was actually full.  When we walked in, it looked dirty, and like the place hadn't had the floors mopped in days.  I got the chicken burrito with sour cream and guacamole.  Mind you, I paid about $2.50 for extra guacamole since I'm a guacamole nut.  When our food was ready, there was some liquid green stuff on my burrito and liquid green stuff in a cup that I could only assume was the guac.  First, the small cup they charged me for wasn't even worth the extra $$ I paid.  Second, the guac was horrible.  It should not be liquid; I understand that some may not like it lumpy, but IT SHOULD NOT POUR!!  I figured I needed to have an open mind, I mean, my friend that recommended it never stopped raving about the place.  As I cut into my burrito, it was liquid on the inside.  It wasn't grease, it was like the water from boiled chicken; which the chicken had a funny taste to it.  I also believe for what I got, it was way overpriced.  The bar that had extra salsa, carrots, etc I would not touch with a ten foot pole since it looked like it had been sitting there for hours and not changed out (it was on a mobile cart that had a broken leg).  Not once did any worker come out to check on the extra bar items.   I'm only giving it a second star because the burrito was big and filling.  That's it.   When I asked my friend why the hell he recommended it, he said because its open 24 hours, and late at night, its the best food to get.  I'm sorry, but I'd rather go to Denny's."}
{"text":"Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and even late night, it is a good time for Amados.  the menu is pretty standard for a Arizona Mexican food shack, the beauty is in the execution. From the beans made with vegetable shortening to the tangy neon green guacamole and bold shredded cheese all of the flavors here POP!  This place also excels when it comes to condiments, There is an amazing red sauce, a very spicy tomatillo green sauce, fresh sliced jalapenos, a cabbage pico de gallo, peeled and sliced cucumbers and spicy carrots.   Last trip I had an old favorite a bean burrito, A pleasantly warm and soft tortilla wrapped some great beans, prodigious application of red sauce made it a great meal.  My friend opted for his usual, carne asada fries. Basically chili cheese fries done the Mexican way.  The place it self is not the fanciest, and there are signs of abuse from the hordes of highschoolers that descend to this place late on weekends. I was one of them just a decade or so go. Time may has passed but I still enjoy the quality value food at Amados."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Amados since I was a kid, recently I have been really disappointed. A lost every time I get sick and the food is way to greasy. But the staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"i love the place,pretty consitent,i love that they dont use LARD in there beans,so veggie friendly for all of you greens out there.the place isnt no 5 star dining expeirence.but it isnt dirty,the staff is not friendly but not overly happy seeing how they have to deal with late night drunks and they all to common family that doesbt quite know what they want and ask there advice as if the employees give a sh*t.all the time your in line,might as well be on the phone.go there its better than filiasquirtos."}
{"text":"The food is really good and it's not as dirty as filibertos is, but they keep messing up my order! They can't take orders in Spanish or English. The girl speaking Spanish that came in after me had to repeat her order about 5 times to the cashier (who also spoke Spanish)."}
{"text":"Bomb burritos, clean, good chile relleno, open late night.  What more do you want?  Much better and easier on the digestive tract than Fili B's"}
{"text":"Good food for sure. Carne asada fries were great, breakfast burritos were good, lacking a little something, maybe pico but otherwise very good food and good prices!"}
{"text":"Hands down just the best place ever . Great great food (better then Filiberto's ) awesome service !"}
{"text":"If you have never been to Amados, you are seriously missing out. They staff is always the same friendly faces that have been there for years... they have mastered the art of making all the classic Mexican food we all know and love. They have the most beautiful murals on the walls and it's a cool place to hangout!"}
{"text":"Yum!   Fast and good.  What else do you want from a place like this?  I've had breakfast meals as well as the rest of the menu and never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"This location is right next door to my job & easily accessible. The food quality is delicious & the employees are very accommodating & friendly.   I love the Carne Asada Fries & the 5 Rolled Tacos for quick, pick-me-up lunches & will try other items on future visits as well.   I recommend Amado's for those gotta-have-it-right-now Mexican food cravings!"}
{"text":"Have tried this place on and off for the past 6 or 7 years.  Big portions, tasty, lots of protein.  Tried the Carne Asada burrito and the Machaca Burrito.  They are so big it is difficult to consume an entire  burrito in one sitting!  Their ingredients taste fresh and seasoned well but not spicy.  Their salsa bar had a lot of flies on it and spilled stuff on the counter top.  I did take out so I avoided it. Four stars if the place were cleaner. Staff is friendly and fast.  They have a drive thru. Not real cheap but good quantities served.  I'll be back perhaps in another year."}
{"text":"I miss Amado's carne asade burritos!!!!! It's less than $5 and you can get a huge horchata with it! Aaaaaaaaargh! Makes me mad that I left AZ!  And everything on the menu is really cheap, too! Plus, they're open 24 hours... but don't go late otherwise you'll run into the drunk people coming from the Tempe/Scottsdale bars!   Authentic Mexican food.. as everyone there is Mexican and very, very friendly."}
{"text":"Breakfast burritos in the morning. Chips Carne Asada for lunch and dinner. This place is awesome, even though it has changed names like 3,000 times. It has always been good. I grew up with this place and would take it over Filiberto's any day. Its worth a stab wound to get one off their breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Stopped in the other day while I was in the area for a quick bite. Two enchiladas, rice, beans and a chicken taco about $11.00 average. What wasn't average was the size of the taco! Holy crap that thing was HUGE and tasty....skip all the 'bertos places and come here, the staff is friendly, fast and polite and you can even understand what they're saying to you. No marbles in their mouths here!"}
{"text":"A group of us had a night out in Scottsdale...on the way home, we stopped at Amados.  Looking over the menu, I was overwhelmed to see that they had a substantial selection of breakfast burritos, tacos, burritos, nachos, enchiladas, tostadas, etc, etc. There were so many choices that it was a tough decision! After much thought, I ordered a carne asada taco and an horchata. The total came out to $4.74.  The taco was not your average size. It was rather large, like a small burrito. Filled with a lot of carne asada, pico de gallo & guacamole. I topped with with salsa & lime juice from the salsa bar. This was delicious and just hit the spot! I was extremely full after finishing the entire thing.  I noticed on the menu that you receive a free bean & cheese burrito with any $5 purchase. Score! Also, for an extra bonus, they are open 24 hours a day."}
{"text":"Amados is one of those places you might see featured in the movie Clerks if Kevin Smith decided to use a restaurant instead of a convenience store. Dirtbags hanging out on the outside, bizarre people on the inside, but products that you just want to keep going back for.  As my friend used to describe it, \"You get a burrito the size of your calf for about 3 bucks.\"  Amados attracts a mixed clientele from construction workers on their lunch break to high school kids using the patio as their own personal smoke shed to post-clubgoers grabbing a 2 am snack.  The staff is all hispanic and most speak english with a strong accent prevailing, yet in the hundred or so times I've been there my order has never been screwed up.   Breakfast burritos are good and carne asada burritos are so loaded with meat that I often avoid it because it's too heavy a meal. Even the basic bean burrito was too much for my ex to finish each time she ordered it.   It's hard to argue the quality, service and low price even if the parking lot clientele may intimidate you at first glance. Avoid the place after midnight if that's the case. That's when the hoopties are in full swing."}
{"text":"If I could give ZERO STARS, I would! The food (bacon, egg, potato and cheese burrito), was amazing, but there is some CRIMINAL activity going on in there (THEFT). My bill was $8.10 for a burrito and a water, which I disagree being charged $2.00 for a styrofoam cup just for some water. Anyways, I handed the young lady Laura (Hispanic gal) my card and she gives me my receipt back and I probably ALMOST did what every other person does and through it away. Something told me to look at it and she charged me 16.20 for what was suppose to only cost $8.10. So I look at the line item and she keyed me in for a $8.10  tip. Oh I lost it! The Drill instructor Marine came back! So she gives me what she thought was the tip back and I happen to look at the money and it was only $7.10 she gave me back. She tried to scam me for the 2nd time in the same visit. So, with this being said, the criminal activity and work ethic toward the customer was totally unacceptable! That's stealing. She claims she did not know how to use the card machine... and I'm calling BULL SHIT! She knew what she was doing. She sure knew how to open that register fast and try to give me money back. She's a thief! If she does not face disciplinary measures then i will not ever do business with this place ever ever again. So a note to everyone that eats here and uses a card to pay.... CHECK YOUR RECEIPT and make sure she does not scam you for a tip you did not approve. ESPECIALLY if her name is Laura.  Bill Cook"}
{"text":"I've been searching for a little Mexican joint like this since we moved here! The horchata was hands down the best I've had in a while & the chimichanga was to die for. The only way I think it could've been better is if it was 3 in the morning on the beginning of a hangover haha"}
{"text":"Great place.  My credit card and bank accounts have more memories of this place than I do, but it's still good.  Go there anytime when the drunk high school idiots are not there (usually late during the week, never on Friday or Saturday).  Disregard previous reviews about cleanliness in this place.  Most chain restaurants that people go to are much dirtier than any concerned reviewer could ever imagine."}
{"text":"This place is good after a night out on Mill or any late night where alcohol is involved.  It's also great place to watch drunks brawl, or end up, after driving over the Big Burrito drive through sign!   They have a good menu selection of typical Arizona mexican food.  They server carne asada in the food so that's cool since, it seems to be getting harder to find places that server carne asada in burrito, tacos and chimichangas, around here.  The food is pretty bland and greasy.  The spicy sauce isn't that hot.  If you go into this place knowing what you're getting yourself into then it's all good.  Makes me realize how spoiled I am to have good Mexican food at my doorstep and all of the great joints in The Mission.    If you're craving mexican food, at 3am, Amados is where you go...just don't go alone!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for nachos earlier and thought I'd give this place a try. I ate here once before when we had moved to this area 4 years ago...and I thought it was ok, but it was something I forgot to Yelp about.  This time I remembered to Yelp.  I'm going against the grain here (surprise) and am going to say it wasn't all that. The other time I came here it wasn't all that either.  The carne asada on the super nachos was bland. The guac? Bland. The refried beans? I never knew they were refried beans until I looked at them.  I can't believe I'm going to say this...but I think I prefer any of the 'berto's over this place.  Yea, I went there.  The place was clean, the girl who took my order was friendly and the guy who gave me my food was friendly as well. Parking lot could do with a good sweeping and someone could pick up all the debris that's out there.  I'll keep looking for a better place to eat."}
{"text":"Was dropping oldest daughter off at work and about to go hit the trails to go hiking but was starving and wanted a breakfast burrito, went by one of my fav places by my house and it was closed until 8, it was 7:20 and I didn't want to wait so I drove down the road to another place placed my order then told me that they couldn't use debit at this time, the machine was down, so I having no cash left, and then I remembered driving by Amados plenty of times coming home from work, so I headed over there and thought eh why not, when I walked I saw on the board Amados special which was a burrito with eggs, ham, potatoes, bell peppers, onions and cheese for $3.70, Yep that's exactly what I wanted! So I order me up on and it was just what I was craving! I am going to have to remember this place for a great breakfast burrito!"}
{"text":"Yuck yuck yuck... I can't believe this place has good reviews.  It must be because a majority of the reviews are written by people who stop here after a night out of drinking.    The other night I was craving some Mexican food and instead of going to the other Mexican joint that's less than a block away, I decided to try Amados.  Big mistake.... huge.  Sure, it's open 24 hours but, so is the competitor around the corner... and they offer tasty food!  My chicken chimichanga plate was gross on a buncha levels,  First off, it's obvious the oil hadn't been changed in a while because I could SMELL the deep-fried tortilla... and not in a good way.  After a test bite or two, I decided I'd just eat the chicken inside but, it was SOOO SALTY that I literally ended up throwing most of it out.  I have never ever done that to a chimichanga before.  :(  Finally, the beans and rice had almost no flavor.  I don't even know how that's possible... rice sure.  Beans tho?!    Because of the 4 stars I was thinking I should give it another try but honestly, just can't stomach the idea of it.    Won't see ya there!"}
{"text":"So I had gone to get a carne asada fix!  And well...This place did not exactly deliver.  I had ordered the carne asada chimi and it had a heaping pile of sour cream and guacamole on top which by the time I got home made the chimi slightly soggy.  It  almost seemed as though the burrito had a million layers of tortillas surrounding the carne asada.  And the Carne asada wasnt amazing either."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place all the time when I was in high school and living in Tempe.  The food hasn't changed much but the interior got a well needed overhaul.  This is just an average taco shop.  Good greasy food at very affordable prices.  Its nice that some of the combos include a drink and there is a soda fountain for free refills.  I always stop by the place when I'm home visiting when I get the late night munchies."}
{"text":"Only go here during the day!!! They don't have a drive-thru and you will get the **** beat out of you for no reason at all!!!! Which is funny because 5 years ago when I went to high school we used to hang out there and they installed cameras because of fights. They honestly don't care and it attracts the WORST kind of people!! You're better off going to Filli B's across the street!!!"}
{"text":"With so many different fast food Mexican shops in Arizona, many people end up choosing the chain ones like Filibertos and Robertos and all those ertos joints. Well Amado's doesn't end with that suffix but their food does everything and beyond suffice. I've been here over 10+ times in the last year (or two) and the quality is never less than superb. My favorite is Fish Taco meal, which has the perfect combination of crunchy and savory toppings in a flour tortilla. Rolled tacos are fresher than most restaurants in the area. I've brought many friends with me here and I've made every person come back on their own because of the quality and price. Gotta try the Amado's Breakfast burrito too!"}
{"text":"I usually love Amado's.  Great late night place.  I've been going there for almost 10 years.  The customer service has never been stellar, you always feel like you're annoying them when ordering, but... I can live with that.  However, I went today and it was the worst experience with Mexican food I have ever encountered in Arizona.  Literally signed up for Yelp just to leave this review, it was that bad.  It was 5pm on a Tuesday (in case the restaurant wants to track who was working).  I ordered a taco plate, #2.  The tacos were cold.  The shells were barely even cooked.  The beef was dripping in grease, and seemed old.  We also got a chips and salsa.  The chips were stale, and on top of them was a scoop of chopped tomatoes and onions with 5 little sides of hot sauce in the bag (not even close to being \"salsa\").  The diet coke tasted foul, I actually threw it away after one gag-inducing sip.  Now, it's been a few hours, and my stomach is in painful knots.  HORRIBLE.  Until they change back to what they used to be, I can't go back there."}
{"text":"Wow I'm so disappointed in this place!!! Sign out front clearly states that the drive thru is always open but there's never anyone there in the morning!!"}
{"text":"Disgusting food, got food poisoning on my birthday from eating the arizona burrito here yesterday."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Mexican fast food. Super greasy, spicy, etc.   I had the chile relleno, it was better than Filibertos but still kinda just meh.   The salsa bar looked like it could use a little more attention. There were no cucumbers and the red and green sauce were all mixed up.  I liked the lettuce, pico mix up thing they had there. :)  There was some construction going on in the parking lot and some construction worker kinda yelled at us for parking in front of the restaurant... If they don't want people to park there they should probably put some cones up or something...  I'll eat there again if I'm near."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant since 2005 and they have always been friendly with delicious food. They have a great salad bar and their hibiscus drink is one that always needs to be large!"}
{"text":"I dont even know why I order anything from here. They never get my rather simple orders right, not once! The food is good but you know what would be better? Getting what I paid for."}
{"text":"Amados is great Mexican fast food with less grease than all those other 'berto Mexican fast food joints that have sprouted around the valley. I especially enjoy the carne asada burritos, with the pico de gallo, cilantro and guacamole, best fast food on the cheap! Their rolled taquitos are super crunchy and loaded with flavor and topped with cheese and the dipping guacamole is not all that but ok for the price. The selection of sugar fruit drinks are good, Tamarindo, Horchata, Jamaica and the Melon drink are good but on the sugary side. The Salsa bar is ok, green and red sauce, diced cabage, sliced limes, cucumbers, pickled jalapenos/carrots and sliced raw jalapenos that will set your mouth on fire!  They are open 24 hours and it tends to be crowded with the local skater poser gavacho kids on the weekends."}
{"text":"This spot is my favorite quick mexican food spot in all of AZ.    Pretty much anything you get here will be good.  Their salsa is on point too!   Stop in, they are quick.  You will be in and out."}
{"text":"Fast, good, and clean. Unless you are in just after the high school kids get through, which is impossible to defeat, this is a great little Mexican food stand style place. Finally a place has embraced the gringo breakfast burrito (bacon, potato, egg and cheese) and named it, New Breakfast Burrito.   If you are in the area and hungry, worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Easily put, a WAY better alternative to Filiberto's  when craving late night mexican food. They have a wide range of the typical mexican fast food and drinks."}
{"text":"Great late night food. We had a carne asada burrito and quesdilla, both were great. Lot of options to choose from. Attaching updated menus for this place."}
{"text":"Couldn't be better! This is really the place to go for Breakfast burritos.  My family and I have been comming here a few times a month for years and rarely had a bad experience.   Today I had the sausage and egg breakfast burrito,  and it was stuffed full of fresh sausage, eggs and cheddar cheese.   I'm pretty sure they make their own flour tortillas,  because I've never had any that tasted like them.   I always ask for plenty of the Verde sauce on the side,  it's hot,  but Sooo good.   We have gone there a few times for the sauce alone! A great place to take out of towers for fast but awesome Mexican food."}
{"text":"U like greasy teens? U like old dudes hanging out with greasy teens? U like out of the way dinky little plaza? U like good Mexican food? Yes, it IS good. \"I shall comeback\" kind of good.   Place is dinky and out of the way but seems clean and food comes out reasonably quick and it tastes good. There were 3 of us who went there for lunch and we all were happy with our orders.   Good lil' join to stop by and grab a bite in super non-pretentious environment.  Ohh yeah!!! Almost forgot - they open 24/7. That is right beatches EVERY SINGLE DAY ALL DAY LONG!!!! Anyone got munches?"}
{"text":"Love the breakfast burrito and bean/cheese burrito. Carne asada is also pretty tasty. The staff is super friendly, and the place is open 24 hours. What's not to love? Also, salsa bar is on point. Lots of options."}
{"text":"It's a dive for sure - but their Carne Asada is delish.  We've been there 4 or 5 times lately and our orders have always been right both through the drive though and inside.  Hubby is a fan of bean burrito & chorizo quesadilla.  I'm all down for the Asada.  They will serve it in a burrito, over fries, nachos - I usually just get it straight up with a bit of cheese and sour cream.  Looking for ambiance?  Go somewhere else.  Looking for cheap Mexican?  Here's your place.  We always take to go - though they do have about 10 booths.  The only bad thing we've had here is the churros - hard as a rock :("}
{"text":"Had a chili relleno burrito here today.  Tasted pretty good and way better than Filiberto's.  It sort of reminds me of Armando's, which used to be near Arizona & Ray, but they closed down quite a few years ago.  Easy.  Good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Amados is far better than all of the Valley \"Something-Bertos\" in every way.   Sure, the front of the store may look \"sketchy\" for Tempe *eyeroll*, but walk on in anyway and you'll find some delicious late night Mexi-grub.   We ordered the Carne Asada Burrito (hold the guacamole) to go, with plenty of the red and green salsas.   Fresh pico de gallo and well-seasoned Carne, big enough for two to share you're sure to satisfy your cravings.   The salsas had just the right amount of kick to them, but nothing painfully spicy.   Open 24 hours, drive-thru for when you're lazy, prices lower than your buddy -Berto (no $10 nachos here!) . . . Stop in next time you're plastered or simply wanting a burrito."}
{"text":"Of all the beto\"s taco shops, this place beats them all. Great food, full side cart....let me at it. Order #11, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Im not sure if this place is like the filibertos places but I  came in for lunch a second time and ordered their carne asada fries (as usual everywhere I go), very good!!!  so far cheaper than all places I've been to, it even comes with a free small drink. what's different about the carne asada fries here is that they add two different type cheeses. I gave it 4 stars because it doesn't come with sour cream. u have to pay extra for it. =)"}
{"text":"Started eating here in 8th grade, waaay back in 1998. Still as amazing as ever, and no matter how many improvements they've made and how successful they've gotten I still feel at home when I go in. Hell first time I ever got sucker punched was in the parking lot junior year of high school hah hah. No matter where I've lived since, Gilbert to ahwatukee, I always end up back at Amados for some great Mexican food. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Look beyond the uninviting store front, with windows protected by metal bars, and you'll find a decent restaurant with cheap quickie eats if you're craving Mexican food. It's nice that they are open 24 hours, so you can have a burrito, torta, or taco any time you want!  We came in search of a breakfast burrito. They have several options here, all under $4. I chose the potato, egg, and cheese ($3.65). It was a hefty burrito, filled to the brim with breakfast ingredients. The textures in the burrito were all too similar, from the slighty mushy potato, the melted cheese, and the soft scrambled egg, and the taste was a bit one dimensional, which made this burrito subpar compared to the heavenly breakfast burritos at Los Favoritos. I had it with some of their hot sauce too, which they only offer in the red variety (Los Favs offers green and red). It was OK, but not as flavorful as hot sauces at other quickie burrito places I've been to.  While they do have a dedicated parking lot, there are limited spots, especially when it's busy. We had to park around the corner in a residential area and dodge cars coming out of the drive-through lane to get to the entrance.  I'll come here again to try some of their non-breakfast foods, but for now, they're just A-OK to me."}
{"text":"BEST Breakfast Burritos in the WORLD!!!  I'm craving one right NOW!  Mmmmm    OPEN 24 HOURS"}
{"text":"Hands down best bang for your buck if you want authentic Mexican food in The Tempe area.The carne asada burrito is good, amados breakfast burrito is my favorite. They also have really good rolled tacos, same with their churros. They're open 24 hours, I've been here at every time of the day. Portions are filling and the food comes out quick. If you're a regular they'll have your order memorized and it'll be out by the time you pay. Their hot sauce it bomb too. You're missing out if you haven't been here."}
{"text":"Been going here for years.  Great neighborhood mexican fast food.  They make my burritos to order.  I dont like cheese so I get beans, rice, and lettuce which is deeeelicious.  Thanks for being awesome."}
{"text":"The best Carne asada fries and delicious hot sauce. I also enjoy the new breakfast burrito. The best thing about this place is it's open 24/7."}
{"text":"If you enjoy watching flies that require ground clearance from the FAA prior to taking off buzz around you as you eat your \"authentic\" Mexican food, then you are in for a treat here!  As for me, I don't particularly enjoy dining in an establishment that clearly has no time for meeting some minimal health & sanitation standards. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Looks are deceiving. I was expecting more of a restaurant than a fast food restaurant and then we pulled up to what looked like it use to be a circle K. Decided to go in anyway and im glad we did. Excellent platter deals. HUGE portions. And the lady who took our order was nice"}
{"text":"I have been coming here on and off for the last seven years.   Seems like the prices have gone up recently. The price you pay for a combo meal is higher than it used to be and more than you pay for lunch around town.  It would be great if Amados offered a lunch special.   I love the Breakfast Burritos, Carne Asada, Carnitas plate and Fish Tacos. The beans and rice are tasty as well. Although, I think the Red sauce could have a little bit more kick to it. Their spiced carrots and onions are delicious. However, sometimes the cucumbers taste a bit like they've been sitting too long and have gone bad. I also enjoy the Horchata as well."}
{"text":"This is one of the best little quick-style Mexican food joints I've found. Compared to all of the 'Bertos out there, this place is second to none.  The quality of the food soars over similar places while the prices coudn't be any lower. I work across the street from Amados with one of those 'Bertos right around the corner. I will never even consider going over there when Amados is the much better choice.  Try the cabeza taco or the chorizo burrito if it's breakfast time! And the rolled tacos are perfect here!"}
{"text":"Amado's has the basic \"to's\" offerings, but they do a great job at Mexican fast food. I adore their Chorizo burrito! :D"}
{"text":"Worlds smallest drive thru lol but reasonable prices and good eats!! Adobada fries are pretty serious!! Viva La Mesa lol"}
{"text":"I started eating breakfast burritos here about 10-12 years ago while I was a FedEx driver in the area. I was a die-hard Amado's breakfast burrito guy and came in almost every Friday to order one on the way to work.   I usually ate the sausage breakfast burrito with eggs, potatoes and cheese. I turned many co-workers and friends onto Amado's over the years. I haven't lived in Arizona for eight years but when I was visiting last week, Amado's was one of the places I visited. The burrito was just as good as I remembered it!"}
{"text":"This places is always good for late night food (after a night out on Mill Ave.) also a great place for a late night brawl.   Try the Carne Asada Chimichanga. It's what gave me my gut!"}
{"text":"I need to revise my review of this place.  The food has actually improved greatly in the past months and I need to let everyone know that am recommending this place again.  I keep coming back because this is one of the few 24-hour spots around and pretty much the only place aside Denny's and IHOP in the immediate vicinity to get late night grub.  They now have a drive-thru and are being renovated so things are looking much better here as well as tasting better..  When they finally finish working on that scary-looking men's bathroom, I'll be even happier. . ."}
{"text":"I ate here a few weekends ago. That night I think we were drugged at a bar by a 6'5\" tall bartender in hotpants short shorts and a cutoff half-shirt because we blacked out nearly everything from that evening. I do remember a few things from that night though...   Specifically, I remember peeing in the bathroom here. Couldn't tell you what it looked like, so I suppose that means it was relatively clean. I also remember standing in the restaurant waiting for our order to come. I don't remember how we got to the destination, but I do sort of remember opening my white Styrofoam takeout container and seeing the beefy cheesy thing I ordered... or at least I think I ordered.   I'm pretty sure I ate it, but I couldn't tell you anything beyond that. I'm sure I liked it okay because I want to go back and eat again. Everyone else I was with seemed to like it as well - those who can remember the evening anyway.   It's possible we were drugged and had disgusting sex acts performed on us - we would have no idea... I don't think we were drugged at Amados, and that's always a plus when a restaurant doesn't drug you.   I woke up in my own bed and didn't have any sort of gut rot from eating the food. We went swimming right after eating apparently, and nobody reported that I threw up or crapped in the pool, so that's another good sign. Good Mexican food is hard to find, so I hope this place lives up to the hype on my second visit."}
{"text":"I have long been a Filbertos fan but now Amados has sold me on them. The carne asada burritos are delish and my wife loves the chicken taquitos. They have a little salsa bar inside so I would advise skipping the drive thru and eating in."}
{"text":"I do love me some Amado's.  Prices are good.  Food is above average.  The only thing I don't like is feeling like I'm going to get mugged every time I go here, regardless of time of day."}
{"text":"The quality of your meal will depend on who is running the deep fryer.  Tacos are usually overcooked..  Salsa bar is usually messy.  Burritos are average but no green chile at this place.  Stay away from the carnitas.  They recook them on the flat top and the look like overcooked corned beef hash.  The only thing authentic about this place is the language barrier."}
{"text":"Great quick Mexican food.  Love the late night taco runs here.  The Carne Asada is my favorite.  Red Hot sauce could have more heat but otherwise not bad."}
{"text":"I have to give this a 4 star for the breakfast burrito   I just had the 'Amado' breakfast burrito and it one of the best I've had in AZ.  Made with hash browns nice and soft to mold the bacon egg and cheese into a gushy goodness! Fast. Hot and great taste if breakfast burritos are your passion as they are mine dont miss this hot spot! Looking forward to a revisit!"}
{"text":"Had Carne Asad Burrito...Yummy....The green sauce was good.....Open 24 hours so I couldn't complain...I was starving.....lol....drive through was fast....I can't complain.  ;)  Asked for xtra sauce they gave me plenty...loved it~!   ;) I heard good things about the Menudo.....going to come back to try~!  ;)"}
{"text":"I have to agree with Lucian. This has become my favorite place and offer more value than any mexican food drive-thru and the food is very good. It's in the center of town for me and they're open late. I like that I can get a free drink for some of their combos and a free burrito if you purchase $5 or more! If you are looking for a fancy dine-in, this is not your place."}
{"text":"OH MY. San Diego-style Mexican food in Arizona?!?!?  That's not a mirage from heat exhaustion (or dehydration from too much alcohol). It is true! I was taken here by a former Socal native and I was in heaven.  Carne Asada fries: tasty-marinated carne asada, skinny fries, legit cheese (both yellow and white), sour cream, and plenty of guac. Mmm Mmm good.  Arizona burrito (aka wanna-be California burrito): heavy on the potatos and needed more cheese... but better than anything in San Jose.  Hot sauce? Spot-on. Could be hotter, but it is just the way I like it: NOT salsa, more hot.  Spongebob Awesomeness: The carne asada burrito looked really tasty. When I go back to Tempe, I am definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"This is such an upgrade over fast food chains!    I always get the steak nachos.  I can't believe they're only $6 out the door.  There's more meat than I can eat, plus cheese & guacamole.   I did the drive thru and they gave me a few lil hot sauce/salsa's too.  I was still tasting this 10hrs later.  Gross to some, but a sign of good inexpensive mexican food.  :-)  Mmmmmm! Already looking forward to my next opportunity to eat here."}
{"text":"I am wiped out and feeling lazy after my daughter had a possible broken bone.  (she's okay but I was too stressed to even think about cooking dinner after waiting over an hour at the doctor's office!) We eat the breakfast burritos here ALL THE TIME.  They are beyond delicious,  and the green sauce ~ I could drink by the cup full!  I am serious!!!   Anyway, we are picking up the prescription at Walgreens and I suggested we grab food for take out.  We were NOT disappointed.  Hubby got the Chimichanga combo.. It could feed a family of four.. Unable to test this theory as he inhaled it ASAP.   :)  Daughter had cheese enchiladas and was perfectly satisfied. They both got the horchata for their drink (I snuck sips.. I love it but it's so sweet I didn't want to ruin my appetite) .  I ordered the Carne Asada  combo.  So amazingly Yummmy!  We will continue to go here again and again as they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this place is delicious. Best Mexican I've had since I've been down here. I wish it was a little cheaper, but it's worth it. I get the carne asada tacos and I crave them all the time.Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I recently came to this drive through super late because nothing else was open. Honestly my expectations were low, and I was pleasantly surprised! The wait wasn't long at all given that it looked like only one person was working. The nachos I ordered were great. The size was plentiful, the balance of amount of chips vs toppings was right on, not too much of one or another. The cheese was a huge surprise. It almost looked and tasted freshly ground, it had great body and really held up this plate of nachos. Next time I need a late night snack, I may just swing by this place again!"}
{"text":"Like the tacos!  Menudo is fair."}
{"text":"The Carne Asada burrito was a lot better a couple years back when they use to put chunks of meat in the burrito instead or the thin sliced stuff they have in it now. It's still a good burrito though and not a bad place"}
{"text":"I didn't even eat here because it was so dirty, bathrooms were so bad, salsa bar a mess, turned off really quick so we left."}
{"text":"Ok.  I'm a Sun Devil alum, so I'll admit that the first two dozen times I visited this place I was NOT sober.  I was convinced that it was amazing after 5 hours of drinking back in the day, so after moving to SoTemp for my professional career, I popped in for lunch takeout quite a bit.  Yup, it's very good sober too ;)  Amado's needs to be taken for what it is:  quick, casual Mexican foods.  I'm a big fan of the rolled tacos, which are generously served with fresh guacamole.  The taco salad is Heaven. Make sure to hit up the little salsa bar during the day to accessorize your meal.  Bonus:  the entire breakfast menu totally helps cure a bad@ss, Mill Ave induced hangover.  For 'em, Amados!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  I have NEVER been disappointed.  My favorite is the Chile Relleno burrito.  I crave this sucker!"}
{"text":"Visiting AZ and missing real mMexican food. This totally hit the spot for my husband and I. Thanks for being open late and having a drive-thru.  Dang now I am craving Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Really pretty lame.   Their food has no flavor. Their salsa has no flavor or spice at all.   Super disappointing."}
{"text":"Amados may not look like much inside or out , but after a nite out or next day headache u just can't shake, this is an excellent cure. Not sure I would come here by myself, but then again I don't ever eat out alone. I've tried a lot and the carne Asada burritos are HUGE and soo good. Can never eat a whole one. Breakfast burritos are amazing, especially ham and cheese, and rolled tacos with guac and cheese are a must! They have really good red and green sauce, and a condiment bar with peppers, carrots sauces and more. Like I said its kinda sketchy, but get past that and It's a pretty great place! Much better then fil- yuckos !!!!!"}
{"text":"Open 24/7 the food is awesome go for the steak egg and cheese burrito if your wanting some good food it always hits the spot. The drive through is tight so make sure you just walk in haha if you like spicy the hot sauce is really fantastic can't beat this for 24/7 Mexican filly b isn't anything compared to this place. Hope this helps and encourages you to try it"}
{"text":"I'd give this place 2.5 stars.  It was fine, could be worse.  A couple observations:  1. The interior was a little dirty, none of the tables were wiped down. 2. They were a little understaffed, I waited for a little before my order was taken cause there was only one cook and one cashier for both dining room and drive thru.  I'll be honest, I ate most of a chorizo burrito about 20 minutes before this review and I feel like shit.  I don't know if it was something in the food, it tasted good and didn't seem abnormal in any way.  It was fast and cheap.  waiting to see if I get sick before I decide if I'll go back haha."}
{"text":"Ordered a breakfast burrito with eggs, potatoes, bacon, sour cream and red sauce. The burrito was about 95% mushy potato. It was like eating flavorless mashed potatoes wrapped in a tortilla. There were maybe 5 small pieces of bacon in the entire burrito and barely a drizzle of red sauce. Definitely don't recommend."}
{"text":"This place is the best mexican fast food there is. Move over Filibertos, Amados is the place to go.  Staff is so nice, the food is outstanding!"}
