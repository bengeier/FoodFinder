{"text":"Got the gyro sub with seasoned fries. The fries were the best part, crunchy and the seasoning is good."}
{"text":"Wildcat is awesome. Try it with fish also. Bacon cheeseburger sub is my favorite. My work orders from here every Friday and is never disappointed. Best subs I've had yet."}
{"text":"I thought the hoagies were good. Then I watched my cold hoagie being made without gloves! Isn't wearing gloves to prepare food others will consume basic food prep?! I will never eat anything from this place when unwashed hands touch my food. And when I asked staff why gloves were not worn to prepare my food they had no answer for their actions. To prove my point I visited again, ordered my sandwich and again no gloves while making my sub! I asked for my refund and explained exactly why I will never return and will tell others not to as well!"}
{"text":"After this sub shop was sold and placed under new ownership, it's been all down hill. The original Rudy's used to be our families favorite but after the switch, it hasn't been the same. Food was undercooked and overpriced. Service was prompt but the place was very dirty. The simple fact that their sign says \"eat here I need the money\" and they charge $3 to use a credit card says it all. I hope someone can turn it around."}
{"text":"Worth a stop if you happen to be in the area! Don't let the inside or location/outside fool you. 
I ordered the wild cat (and with the suggestion of the cashier, added buffalo sauce) - it was unique! 
If the chicken was a fresh, it would've been a bomb sandwich. That being said, it is a good \"cheat meal\" spot. 
The wild cat is breaded chicken, bacon, cheese sauce and shoe string fries. Bread was soft and the sandwich filled me up with a half!"}
{"text":"Great place good food. The staff is exceptionally nice. I don't that what some folks are complaining about. Burger and fries are great"}
{"text":"Good subs nice staff. If you need anything you can ask Fat Cat himself. Usually eat here 3 times a month"}
{"text":"Eh, this place is your typical frozen food that they deep fry to make edible. Place has been under construction for over 2 years and isn't the cleanest place in the world. A bit more expensive than you would think for the quality of food. They consider a chicken parm sub a speciality sub and charge 10 bucks for a whole.the biggest thing that turns me off is the sign above the door that says \"please come back, I need the money.\" It's never a good look to beg for business in my opinion."}
{"text":"So far so good. I only had the cold Italian, but plan on coming back to try something different.  When I ate my Italian I noticed that there was not lettuce, tomato or onion on it, not sure if it comes with it."}
{"text":"This place is just as it posts - good drunk food at 2am.  So, if you aren't drunk, I would NOT recommend."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. Had a steak sub and fresh cut seasoned fries and overall, everything was good. I was surprised how fast my food came out (and if there was one gripe about the sandwich...it's that the onions could have used a few more mins on the grill to become awesome) and overall I enjoyed it. As a side note, the guy working the register was nice and helpful. 

Outside of that, the place isn't the cleanest that I've been to. And the time I was there (I got some work done while I was eating) the 3 ppl who were apparently on the clock there could have been making the place more presentable.  They were just chilling because I was the only one in there. It was 1pm on a Thursday, it could have been busier...I'm sure these things are related. 

If the place had just been of \"normal\" cleanliness, it would be a 4-5 based on the lunch I had. 

Dear owner, you're paying your workers anyway...get your place clean."}
{"text":"Fat Cat Subs is a great little place to visit when you're in the area.  For such a small building they offer a rather large menu filled with many unique made to order subs and other diner type fair."}
{"text":"This is your typical outskirts-of-Pittsburgh sub shop. It is close to my hometown so out of convenience I've been here a few times when visiting family. There are times when the subs have been better than others. But generally they are just okay. 

The warm subs are a bit soggy at times, though not bad.  I tend to get the chicken parm sub and it is usually good enough!

The inside of the location isn't great. I wouldn't really eat in, but takeout is fine.

Overall, just so-so. Typical, unhealthy Pittsburgh food!"}
{"text":"I got the steak supreme and it was delicious! Bread was fresh. Steak and peppers were well cooked. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Neat little sub shop.  Clean also!  Really friendly staff!  I think this use to be Rudy's Subs but change a while back.

\"The Purrrrfect Sub\".  Nice slogan; and the hoagie sub was really good.  Also, the \"soon to be famous\" homemade potato chips were top notch.

They had homemade chili and lots of subs, fresh cut fries and even some pizza.  Next time will need to try THE FAT CAT sub, an interesting combo of cheeseburger sub with Capacolla, Egg, Bacon, Provolone, Onions, Peppers and more!"}
{"text":"Do you want great subs or great ambience? Me, I prefer the former...which is why I highly recommend Fat Cat Subs. No frills, just good food, great local spot where the customers playfully interact with the cooks. If you have to have linens and silverware, go somewhere else. As for me, the next time I'm in Cheswick, I'm going back there...no question!"}
