{"text":"Been here 3 times, first to celebrate my birthday and 2 family dinners. I find the level of service to be acceptable for a place that gets really busy. I've had good service one time, and felt rushed the other times. The food is good and I find it to be reasonably priced. Family favorites are the calamari, veal meatball, and orrechiette pasta. Little things prevent me from giving it a 4 star rating such as wines are served warmish in plasticky glasses and when we asked our server for some parmesan cheese, he said 'what for?'"}
{"text":"Excellent service and quality. Ordered take away lasagna and pasta, absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious with 2 friends. Ordered the veal lasagna with the fried cauliflower as a side.  I can honestly say that this meal was horrendous.The veal lasagna was  swimming in grease and the noodles were so overcooked that they were like mush. Furthermore it was totally tasteless.  I can't even find words for how awful the cauliflower was. It was certainly not fried. It was boiled, overcooked, sitting in water, and totally devoid of taste. I would not serve this to a senior in a hospital.  Just returned from 10 days in the US, where I ate fabulous food everywhere - fresh ingredients bursting with flavor. We ate at a cool bistro in suburban Detroit that had the most delicious brussels sprouts ( locally grown) I've ever eaten made with agave nectar and sharazi. How can this be compared with the awful cauliflower of last night!  Toronto needs to learn a few lessons in good cuisine- don't know how Joanne  Kates can think that this is even palatable food- it was gross and this morning I even feel ill from all that grease. Wake up Toronto."}
{"text":"\"Hearty Italian\" are the two words that spring to mind when I think of 7 Numbers. The servings are generous, the food flavorsome and the presentation simple yet refined. My party of 4 tried the family sharing option whereby you each get to choose your own main dish but are also served with salads and calamari to start, then pasta before being laden with the mains plus sides, by which point you will be hard pressed to finish all the food on account of being so full up.   The salads were an impressive start to the meal in that being so seemingly simple they still manage to be unique and tasty in their own way (we had spinach with mushroom sprinkled with soft cheese, rocket with red pepper sprinkled with soft cheese, and tomato with mozzarella in a vinagarette dressing). The calamari was also tender and enough for 2 pieces each. Of the pasta dishes the lasagne was by far the stand-out being wonderfully layered, enriched in a delicious tomato sauce and achieving an almost melt-in-the-mouth texture. Unfortunately the smaller pasta shells and brocollini I thought were a bit on the tough side.   Then with the mains the cauliflower mash is a sizeable portion propping up its two lamb chops, the lamb shank is a mighty sight, and the hunter chicken came as two chunks of chicken surrounded by gravy and various vegetable pieces. Sadly one piece of the chicken was too salty to enjoy. The grilled zucchini was a delightful side to have alongside the meats whilst the accompanying salad I felt had been doused in too much vinegar.   For a dessert, the nutella tiramisu fills a surprisingly big container - similar to the size of a small plate and certainly something a single person might find a challenge to finish eating, especially after the unsurmountable amounts of food we'd already had, nevertheless if you are up to the task, this dessert is indeed well made and worth a try.  All in all 7 numbers may be a little rough-around-the-edges and go a bit overboard with some of its flavoring but it can offer a wholesome good-value meal, perfect for a cosy night out with friends or loved ones."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Excellent service, unbeatable food at a price unfathomably cheap for the quality of food you receive.   We had the calamari, the meatballs and linguine. Everything was to die for. The meatballs were easily the bet I've had. Our server (unfortunately we can't remember the name!) was one of the best. We tried the Sweetgrass beer. Please try it. It was fantastic.    5 stars. Will absolutely be back. As soon as possible."}
{"text":"Seven Numbers has a great atmosphere, cozy, warm and candlelit. We were seated within reasonable time, about 20 min around dinner time on a Saturday night. Veal lasagne was absolutely excellent. Probably the best tomato sauce in any dish I have ever had. The dessert, a chocolate/caramel tart was just good, underwhelming after the excellent lasagne. Definitely would have been better served warm too. Coffee was also good-no cream however. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"No need to be so unfriendly (!) on the phone when people call to see if you have room! You are in the service industry after all in case you have forgotten."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in Toronto.  This is the only Italian restaurant that's food rivals my Mothers. I've been to all the top restaurants in Toronto and time and time again this one reigns supreme.  Terroni tastes like a foot in comparison. Order the sexy duck leg, insanely amazing!   I cannot stress this enough, best Italian restaurant! Charming trattoria-like atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say that it wasn't all I'd hoped for. The decor was confusing, the tables cramped, and unfortunately the food had way too much salt. On the flip side, the staff were very nice, though service was a bit slow. And the bread? It's in a bin (think old-fashioned bathtub), and I watched a staff member put a clipboard ON the bread. Not cool."}
{"text":"3.5/5! Cute homely resto with very affordable family style meal :) the pasta is fresh and the meatballs are very well seasoned. My favourite was definitely the calamari"}
{"text":"Incredible from start to finish. We did the family meal which gives you a good variety of 7 Numbers' menu including apps, pasta dishes and mains.  Great decor, service, menu and the music was fantastic too. A great place for a low key, delicious Italian meal."}
{"text":"We had a great time there today.. Great food, wine and atmosphere. We ordered fish of the day, shrimps and lamb, all meals where just amazing"}
{"text":"We went there for an early dinner on Sunday with kids. The service was great. The lasagna was exceptional. One of my sons had meatballs, delicious! As desert we had flourless chocolate cake. It was very rich and satisfying. We loved it. Food is very family friendly."}
{"text":"We came here for our last summerlicious dinner and it definitely did not disappoint. Great value for the price and the food and service were fantastic. The restaurant itself has a nice cozy feel and you can see Rosa cooking away in the front. They had a beer on their menu which I've never seen anywhere else called Sweetwater and if you like a nice light beer to have with an appetizer, this is a good pick.  Three of us ordered off the summerlicious menu and the other 2 couldn't help themselves and ordered off the regular menu. The prosciutto salad looked amazing! The meat was lean, and the salad was extremely tasty. Another person had the grilled shrimp with spicy pea puree, and that was also tasty. I had the veal meatball filled with cheese. It was a giant meatball that was so so good. For the mains, one person had the best osso bucco that she's ever had, another had a lamb shank which was also delicious. Two others had lasagna which didn't disappoint and I had the Orechiette which was so flavourful and delicious. We all had the same dessert which was the apple crumble cheesecake. I had to share mine because I was stuffed. All around delicious. I'm looking forward to holding my wedding rehearsal dinner here. I know they won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"We tried 7 numbers for the first time one Wednesday night. No reservation, we got a table around 7pm and the place soon filled. We shared the calamari to start and found it a good size for one and very fresh and tasty. For mains we ordered the 'sexy' duck leg and the lasagne. Both where homely and delicious and good size portions. We also shared sides of two tomato salad and grilled zucchini. For desert we shared the strawberry cheesecake which was great. Service was quick, friendly and attentive and the cosy ambience was enjoyable. The meal cost was very reasonable. Recommended highly. Especially when Mama is cooking here herself! ;)"}
{"text":"Ok guys. I ate at the 7 numbers again, just yesterday. What an amazing place... we were 4 people and we ate and ate... and the bill was 130$ for all (including 3 course.. and drinks). most of the plates are about 10$, they arent too big but very tasty. the hospitality is amazing. i would give them 5 stars.. but we needed to stand in line, although we had a reservation.   on thing to remember: those guys has 2 restaurats. one on the Danforth and one on Eglinton/Avenue (very near to their first location which was closed few years ago). enjoy"}
{"text":"I love the veal lasagna. I get it for takeout many times when I have a late night at the office."}
{"text":"I came here because of all the amazing reviews and was excited to try authentic italian food.  Walking by the restaurant, from the outside you can see the chef (the mama) and the sous chefs cooking. So the kitchen is at the front for the public to see and the seating is in the back.  We go in, the \"mom\" aka the owner, greets you, very sweet! And we're seated. IT.IS.SMALL in that place! Tables aren't even an arms length away. If i were to hold out my arms and spin i would have hit like 6 other people sitting near me, that's how tight it is.  Anyways the server hands you an ipad as a wine menu and the regular menu is on a chalkboard on 2 walls of the restaurant.  Everything you order is whatever is on the menu, so for instances, if you ordered steak you'll get strickly steak and you'll have to order what you want on the side as another dish. It's pretty cheap for the pasti, but everything else is a bit $$ for the portion size.  Tried the shrimp, which was $8.50 for 5. They were delicious!! Was going to order more but couldn't justify paying $17 for 10 shrimps.  We got the calamari, that was just alright. Was kinda dissapointed because there was so much hype over it, maybe its just me though, i thought it was going to be CRISPY but it was soft crispy (if that makes sense)  Both my boyfriend and i got lasagne and that was good. Kinda dissapointing the server didnt offer us pepper or fresh cheese... :/  This place gets crowded fast, loud music playing, VERY dim, candle light dinner. If i were in the neighbourhood i'd come back.  upon leaving the place, the mom thanked us. very sweet  service 3.5 food 4.5 price 3 atmosphere 4"}
{"text":"Nice cozy atmosphere,  with the fun of a loud Italian kitchen bustling open to the dining room. Food was very good for the most part, the pasta dishes were a bit bland, but nothing some of their hot chili oil can't fix. Great place to go for sharing, good portions, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Part of my new foodie escapades, my friends and I were contemplating which Italian restaurant to try out. I suggested few locations, not including 7 Numbers, however my friend told me that it is a great place, and it is definitely worth it, particularly the family share meal. I took his word for it and we all went.  Finding the restaurant is not a problem, and as for parking goes, one can park on the side streets behind the restaurant. You either have street parking or paid parking. When we entered the restaurant, it was busy - normal for 7:45PM and we were immediately greeted and seated down. The ambiance is very rustic, hip and the lighting was semi dim.  The noise level was average, and this place is definitely for a date, as I think one cannot hear another.   That being said, we decided to go for the family share menu, which consists of 3 dishes from the antipasti, all three pastas from the primi, and one main from the secondi. The price for this is $34 per person, not including gratuities of course.   We told the server that I am vegetarian, and he assured me that there is no need to worry, as most of the dishes are vegetarian. To start we had the calamari, of course I didn't touch this, the Pepperoni (no not meat - Roasted red peppers with arugula and goat cheese) and the Caprese. It did not take long for this to come, and my taste buds sure had a memorable feeling. I guess you really can't mess up the above, either way, it was tasty.   Onto the Primi which consisted lasagne, orechiette and the linguine. The lasagne, I did not have, as it was made with ground veal. However the other two pasta dishes were perfect. The texture, flavours and overall taste were fantastic. I have never had pasta like this before in my life, and I can definitely vouch for it.   Last but not least, the Secondi. Being a vegetarian, my choices were limited as it is, and that being said, there was only one option to choose from. This was the palmugiane.(Pan-fried eggplant baked in tomato sauce). It looked like the traditional eggplant parmigiana, but it was not. The portion size was perfect and the sauce was great. However, it had a huge aftertaste of egg. I could definitely taste it, and it was on the high side. You know the taste when cookies, pasta have a lot of egg in it? Well this was like that. Would I order this again? Definitely not.   Now you wonder why I docked a star? Well, one primarily being the fact that their secondi menu has only 1 vegetarian item, and the other being the palmugiane having a lot of egg in it, 1 star was docked off. If someone who is reading this does not like the aftertaste of egg in their mouth, or rather noticing the huge taste, this dish is definitely not for you. Heck, even the pasta you couldn't taste the egg flavour to it.   Overall, I'd definitely visit this place with my friends again and highly recommend it, regardless whether you are vegetarian or not.   Foodies, definitely check out this place!"}
{"text":"So a German, an Indian and a Chicagoan walk into an Italian restaurant ... no joke, true story. business trip to Toronto, Yelp to the rescue.  I am a huge fan of authentic Italian (hard to find in North America). This place offers traditional dishes in traditional portions, made to eat thru the courses (antipasti, primi, secundi) as intended.  Everything about this restaurant is charming: the kitchen is in the front and you can actually peek in thru the huge glass front. When you walk in, you're greeted by the small staff. Very rustic interior, the menu written on the white board (only the wine menu on the iPad is a bit anachronistic). We went with the family style dinner: salad, pasta & main for 29$ (you share the first courses but pick your main). Great selection. The goat cheese with the salad was fantastic. The calamari were such a nice break from the usual fried & breaded version. Then the pasta selection was really diverse. Hidden gem: the homemade pickled peppers. Not only spice things up but extremely flavorful. We ended up throwing peppers into the leftover pasta sauce and scooped it up with bread. Good times. By the time our mains arrive, we're already calling this a winner. I chose the osso buco ... fall-of-the-bone goodness, no knife needed.  The server alone (wish I could remember his name) deserves 5 stars, super attentive, witty and extremely knowledge about the dishes and their ingredients. I actually returned a month later with 2 different coworkers (form 2 different countries) and he remembered every detail about our conversation. Wikipedia should show his picture under perfect host."}
{"text":"You travellers that say (or the friends who have heard them say) the best meal they ever had was in Italy?  Go here for that experience. There is a palpable difference in where the tomatoes come from, how long it slow cooks, a person who has made a dish umpteen times knows what \"pinch\" of something elevates a dish.   Rosa and her sons are the cutest and clearly the type of people who genuinely get joy from seeing people swoon over their lovingly prepared meals. Perhaps I am waxing poetical but seriously the osso buco is unreal. There was this hot (ish) oil brought to the table that looked like it has blackened okra in it, was clearly some kind of pepper, and has a slight crunchiness to it and was sublime. I honestly have dedicated a lot of thought to how it was made and the hours it would take me to try and re-create it.   My cousin took me here for dinner, it being a favourite of her husband and herself and I really want to go back. Many times. I recommended it to my boss and he responded he had been there many times and (smart dude) he takes his wife out on regular dinner dates all over the city.   It really feels 'family style' in that everything tastes like it's someone's grandma's staple. Can't be replicated since only their hands know the consistency, their nose the correct aroma etc.   You will leave happy, satiated and desirous of a further visit."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious but I was there last night for dinner and I was surprised at how terrible the service was. We got seated and then patiently waited for someone to take our order and no one came so we had to ask to order. That continued the whole night. No one asked us if we would like another drink or brought more water when we were out. We had to ask to order dessert and then again for the bill. The place was busy but being a small restaurant not unmanageable. I was very disappointed  and surprised by the whole experience."}
{"text":"Wow, great food, the \"family style\" dining was incredible value -- there were three of us, we got four appetizers, three pastas, three entrees with two vegetables... all for $28 each.  And all of it so delicious with fun and friendly service.  My new favourite place."}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday night and had maybe the best lasagna of my life!!!  I have honestly been dreaming of it ever since and plan to return very soon. You can tell the pasta is homemade and it had big, real chunks of ground beef in a delicious tomato sauce.  AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Great place with delicious food. Have been a few times and never had a problem, staff are always great! Went with a group of 10 last night for a birthday and everything went perfectly. Menu is very Italian with 4 courses to chose from so portions are bit smaller, but very tasty. The Veal Lasagna is delicious!"}
{"text":"The excellent service and the none pretencious atmosphere of this restaurant is what sold me on this place!  The food is good.  It's authentic, traditional and made with love. The prices are also very very reasonable for Toronto.  It's definately worth checking out!"}
{"text":"came here with a group of friends for an 8pm reservation. we were seated immediately and saw the italian nonna that was featured on the website, so i knew the food was going to be good. we went with the family style meal which came with x many starters, x many salads, x many pastas and a main of individual choice. i went with the \"sexy duck leg\", because i live and breathe for duck. and let's be honest...the name expresses my sentiments towards duck precisely.   the salads were descent, but who screws up salad, right? the calamari was DELICIOUS and included plenty of tentacles (my fav). the pasta was LEGIT AMAZING. so i had high hopes for the duck leg.   i got my duck leg and it was COVERED in fennel. CRUSTED in fennel. nowhere on the menu does it say fennel because i would have ordered the lamb shank instead. fennel = deal breaker.   so i removed the skin completely to try the meat, just to be hit with an unreasonable amount of salt. my dad is from shanghai...we eat A LOT of salty food. i've been told that i prefer things much saltier than the average person. this duck leg was one of the saltiest things i've ever had in my mouth in recent history, short of eating salt directly from the shaker. i ate it anyway, punctuated with large gulps of water in between each bite. when the server came to collect the plates, he asked how it was. i said that i was very salty. the host came to me and said, \"sorry you got a salty duck leg. it usually happens with later reservations.\" i appreciated his apology for what it was, but what does that MEAN exactly that duck legs get saltier later on in the evening? do you marinate it in salt water or something????   i would definitely go back for the pasta. not for the salty sexy duck leg.   the lamb shank was amazing though and fell off the bone. highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food; our kids love the meatballs Nice people; very hospital and friendly"}
{"text":"GREAT CHANCE FOR A DELICIOUS MEAL, AND A CHANCE TO HELP THE PEOPLE WHO INVENTED WHAT YOU'RE ENJOYING We came here because they're one of three Italian restaurants in Toronto doing something to help the people of Amatrice, who are still getting over an earthquake.  They donate the proceeds from a dish founded in Amatrice, and named after it: called \"alla matriciana.\"  Because the earthquake made it impossible for the people in Amatrice to produce and export their prized dish, the restaurant didn't have the pig cheeks needed to make the dish the way it was invented. So they made do with prosciutto, cut by the restaurant staff to imitate the real thing.  They did a fantastic job.  Now I'm really looking forward to the real thing.  One reason why Italian has spread around the world so easily is that the ingredients are relatively affordable, thanks to the fact that Italians learned to cook for kings on a pauper's budget. Like pork cheeks and pasta -- what could be cheaper, or more delicious?  From Rome south to Sicily and north to Turin and Milan, they all have a city specialty. What a country!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. The service is great and the food is delicious. And because the menu changes every day, you're in for a surprise every time. The portions are the perfect size. This is the go-to restaurant in my neighbourhood when I don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"My first visit was dated in 2013 when I just moved here and I was desperate in finding a good Italian place to eat without breaking my bank. I was super happy to discover 7 and mama rosa. The food here reminds me of Italian home cooking, a little bit messy and a little bit go-with-mood, but it certainly satisfies my stomach. I kept on coming back and brought many of my friends to try this place. Why I like about this place? 1. Quality of food, everything you order is delicious 2. Great value /good price for what you get 3. A chill and chic dating spot too! In the summer, definitely go back to the patio!"}
{"text":"I am truly impressed. We usually never go out for Italian food, because most places don't go beyond pizza and pasta. And why go out for food you can make from home?   So after hearing the hype, we had to try it. Remember to make reservations! It was packed to the brim. And worth the wait.   Our group all ordered the family meal for $28 each. At first we were afraid it wouldn't be enough food... I was so wrong! They brought everything that was currently under the Primi and Pasta section to our table. And all of it was wonderful. Lush and simple flavors. My fave was the veal lasagna. And then each person got to order a main dish. Upon my pleasant experience with the lasagna, I ordered the veal meatballs. Wow. To die for. Lovely and light seasoned veal with a heart of Parmesan cheese. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.   Maybe not a good first date place because it's hard to hear each other talk, but definitely has good mood lighting."}
{"text":"We came to this place attracted by BlogTO's boast of the best lasagna in town. What's a better way to try the place then the Family Meal it has on the menu. For a set price you get to try a little bit of all their well known food.  It comes with appetizers, salads, pasta, and a main course to share.  With all the rave reviews, we thought we were going to have the best meal of our lives.  To note: Their Lasagna was pretty good. It comes in the menu as a small for just under $10 or a bigger pasta size.  I will return just for that.  Everything else, my companion and I were pretty disappointed.  Granted, it should be pretty hard to screw up a salad. Most is just compilation of freshly chopped up raw ingredients.  One of the salads was dressed REALLY sour.  I ended up taking it home and tossing it with more raw vegetables to be palatable.  The pasta sampler plate they provided came with 3 pasta of their choices - this included the legendary lasagna.  It was the ONLY good thing on the plate. One of the pasta was undercooked so it was still crunchy. We had to send it back to be more \"al dente.\"  The only control of choice you have was the main dish. We were able to each choose 2 mains individually -  a pork chop and a lamb shank.  That being the highlight of the meal, we were both pretty disappointed too.  The pork chop was way overcook and tough. The lamb shank - well...we had better elsewhere.  We expected a lot more going into the restaurant especially paying over $100 including wine. We both agree afterwards we should had just gotten a lasagna and that's it.  This place was not horrendous but I would not go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so cute and I am so glad I tried this place out for summerlicious! Everything we had was delicious! The staff were super friendly.  The only downside is that the restaurant is a little cramped."}
{"text":"They know food! Fresh, top quality, perfectly ripe ingredients, cooked to perfection! We started with the tomato salads, and proceeded to shared linguine w/ rapini & an order of meatballs. Delicious, coming from a couple who cook many cuisines at a high level. And yes, we've eaten in Italy, too. Service was friendly and professional: not rushed, but not made to wait either. Just right. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Simple and authentic -- my favourite Italian restaurant in the city. For those that know real Italian food, it's the homemade tomato sauce that sets this place apart. It literally brings me back to my childhood.  The atmosphere is intimate, but casual. On busy nights, it can get a bit noisy and a little crowded, but that's part of the experience. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of ingredients, but if I had to list a complaint, I'd like to see larger portion sizes. That said, I was fed by an Italian grandmother as a child, so take that for what you will.  Service is always friendly and warm; it's the perfect neighbourhood restaurant."}
{"text":"I'd always been curious about this place and finally went last night.  Atmosphere was fantastic; cozy & comforting, eclectic but not overly so furniture and decor. Workable for a romantic date, or a more casual dinner-with-friends, with dripping candles in wine bottles, sitting on crate paper and burlap tablecloths.  Nightly menu full of I-can't-possibly-decide options up on chalkboards. Everything is very simply prepared and presented on a collection of mismatched dinnerware. Looks, feels, tastes, pretty much is, delicious homemade food.  Table bread was surprisingly lackluster, but whatever Calamari was great Osso Bucco was good but a little overdone Lamb shank was very good Homemade butter tart I will be dreaming about for days  Next time will definitely have to try some pasta dishes."}
{"text":"Terrible experience here, the fat dude with glasses was very rude,  we went out for a dinner with family for a birthday but this was a terrible choose,  food was ok, and the family meal plan is the worst rip off ever. Usually in other restaurants when you pay 38$ for a meal everyone gets it's own portion, here we had 3 family member buy it only sharing 2 small plates, what a rip off 20$ extra just for that, comes with 60$ for 2 small plate dishes ? TERRIBLE"}
{"text":"Great place!  We visited it during Summerlicious and there were a couple of vegetarian items on the menu which was great.  My pasta was delicious and my boyfriend's panfried eggplant was amazing as well.  We were quite full and took our desserts home for later but they were amazing too.  Filling, a variety of items.  Seemed like a fair price for the other items as well.  It was a bit packed but that would be because of Summerlicious."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to the restaurant for the first time this evening.  The staff was most welcoming and helpful.  She ordered the eggplant parm and I had the veal lasagne.  Both came hot and were delicious.  As we had theatre tickets we could not linger.  The only down side was the noise, as there was a large party and with the low tin ceilings, it was a stretch to hear.  Will go back again as the food was excellent."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing. The amount of food options and if you are lucky enough to be able to go when grandma is cooking it really has a homey vibe and amazing food and dining experience. Me and my bf went for our anniversary and it was a great romantic spot to go to have an intimate dinner experience."}
{"text":"The chef and owner greets you warmly when you walk in the door.  We went in without reservations on a Saturday night- not because we didn't call ahead, but because they told us that they only take reservations for groups of 6 or more.  (we were 2 people)  We stood in line, without really any greeting - no one telling us how long it would be, or acknowledging our presence (besides the warm greeting from the chef).  A group of 4 walked in behind us -- \"How many?\" one of the servers asked them.  \"4,\" they say, and then,lo and behold, 2 minutes later, they get sat -- as they passed out one of the customers said, \"Don't be mad, we had a reservation --\"  but I thought they only take resos for 6 or more people?  And then why did they ask you \"how many\" and not for your name?  Probably regulars, and there's nothing I hate more than money favouritism.  I didn't realize regulars' money was worth more than mine.  One we were seated, the ignoring continued throughout the night -- glasses cleared but never asked if we wanted anything else to drink (maybe that's why new customers don't seem worth it money wise - we don't get a chance to spend any money!), never asking if everything was ok -- we had to flag people down whenever we wanted to order something.  The space is cramped, almost seems romantic until the baby at the next table starts screaming.  So how did this place manage 3 stars?  Well priced, and the food really was good.  The service and the snobby atmosphere may go hand in hand with the neighbourhood, but they should watch Pretty Woman again for a lesson in how to treat a customer that, for all you know, eats out a lot and spends a lot of money doing it."}
{"text":"I made plans with a group of 6 last Friday for a Saturday night dinner in midtown--not exactly the best timing. Thanks to Yelp I discovered 7 Numbers Restaurant. Luckily they take reservations of 6 or more, so they had a table for us. (It's not easy booking a large reservation the day before).   7 Numbers seems to be a family business. There's an open kitchen at the front and you can peer in through the window from the street which is a pretty cool idea. They have an ever-changing menu displayed on a chalk board. The space is small, but they did a good job of spacing out the tables and the noise level was fine despite it being full. I'm happy we were a large group because there was a lineup almost out the door last Saturday at 8pm. I suggest you get here early or eat with a group of 6 if you come here.   The service was very good once our group arrived. The wine list by the glass was small and I had a chianti which I wouldn't recommend.   We had:  Barretta - 2/5 skip this, I have had much better Baretta. It was cold and bland. I like the pickled vegetables it came with.  Beet salad - 4/5 if you like beets go for it! It was beets, gorgonzola cheese and almonds.   Caprese salad - 1/5 It looked dismal. Small balls of cheese with pale slices of tomato.   Veal meatballs - 5/5 everyone loved these  Veal lasagna - 3/5 2 people ordered this. One person loved it, one person though it was Okay.  Fish of the day 5/5- it was a Branzino and it was AMAZING. There were some bones in it, but it didn't even matter it was so tasty.   Somebody had the linguini I didn't try it but she loved it. I can not give it a rating.   Also, the Osso Buco was sold out by 8:30 when we placed our order, so it must be really good.   Desert:   apple cheese cake 2/5  Flourless chocolate cake 2/5  Both desserts were bland and a bit on the dry side.   The bill came to $200 with the tip. VERY REASONABLE.   If you're looking for a casual, no fuss, home-cooked Italian meal 7 Numbers is the place for you. If you want something a bit fancier with more complex favours, it may not be the best choice."}
{"text":"Mamma's meatballs are one of the many reasons to hit this location. Owner  is a reason to visit Danforth location, always entertaining if you sit at the bar :) The food is always on point at the Eglinton location. The lasagna, rapini, everything I have had is always great and feels like it is homemade and made specifically for you. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, as well as intimate.  This is more of a southern Italian feel, crusty rolls to wipe your plate after polishing off the saucy morsels in front of you.  Always a favourite and will always recommend!"}
{"text":"We've loved this place for years!  The food is amazing, the chef/owner is super warm and friendly, the staff are wonderful with great warmth and humour. This place is a solid 10/10!!"}
{"text":"This was really the best dinner we've had in a long time we had decided to try something new and we weren't story the fish of the day was cooked to perfection and you know it mouthwatering sauce the environment was like a real Italian place"}
{"text":"Tasty food, but a bit of a disappointment.  I booked a big party for my brother's birthday people. They were incredible about this, they kept in communication with me and were actually able to accommodate 26 adults and 6 babies with a week's notice, which grew to 32 adults, then shrunk back to 26 once we got there. Flakiness.   We all had the $34 prix fixe, which meant three apps and three pastas shared family style and an individual entree dish. I was sitting at a table with 11 other people, and we didn't get enough food. Each of the sharing dishes was a dinner plate size, shared across all 12 of us, leaving everyone with literally 2 soup spoons full of each item. This was a huge surprise to me as I've eaten at the Danforth location with the same sort of setup - big party, shared plates, except we had the same size of dish for 4 people.   The other tables in our party (table of maybe 8 adults and 4 kids, and another table with 5 adults and two kids) got the same amount of food, and they were pretty stuffed. We ended up asking for a second portion of the pasta, because it really was a very small amount of food per person, especially considering the price of the meal. The server balked at this, but gave us another serving, which was devoured in a second.   The food itself was very good (though the osso buco was a bit bland), and for the most part, the service was great, but unfortunately the dinner ended with a table of adults who were still hungry."}
{"text":"When you walk into this restaurant, you are immediately greeted by the kitchen area.  You can see everything they're doing, and it's completely open to the restaurant.  I'm a fan of this style as it always shows that the kitchen has nothing to hide!    One thing that I found lacking was the service - we were \"led\" to our table soon after arriving, but it really wasn't completely clear where we were supposed to sit.  He grabbed something off the table, then walked away, leaving us unsure whether we should sit there or follow him.  We chose to sat, and it seemed to be the right choice.  We were given iPad menus which was surprising, and especially surprising when we realized that they didn't contain the actual food menu.  Only the drinks were on the iPad, and the food was written on chalkboards on the walls.  Both are great ways to present a menu, but I really don't think they complement each other when used in conjunction.  One or the other I think, or chalkboard and a paper drinks menu.    We made our selections though: a beer, a glass of red wine, an order of calamari, veal lasagna, and lamb shank.  The red wine was served in a small tumbler, which again was a surprise.  I admit that it took away from the effect for me.  I order a glass of red to enhance the dining experience, and to have it served in a glass I'd drink orange juice out of felt strange.    The food though - was fantastic.  The calamari wasn't battered, it had a lovely light flavour to it, and it was cooked to perfection.  I loved it.  My lamb was also delicious, again the flavours were amazing.  My partner's lasagna was very tasty, although the veal and the sauce made it very rich.    You could easily spend a lot here on different courses, but you could just as easily enjoy a very reasonably priced entrée and a side - both of our meals were plenty for us.  I definitely think this restaurant is more of a $$ or $$$ rather than $$$$.    All in all, although the service could improve as could some of the smaller details that contribute to the experience, the food is bang on.  I'm very excited that the sister restaurant is close to my new apartment!  I'm sure to become a regular if it's as good as this one."}
{"text":"Favourite southern Italian in Toronto. Wish they still had the rabbit on the menu. Definitely get the osso buco. Order as a group and share for best experience."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. The one star comes from the food (I'll give it to them, it's tasty). However, the service was so incredibly poor -- but when gratuity is automatically built in I suppose there's no urgency with a larger party."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here for her birthday and Summerlicious Great atmosphere and great food! Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Interesting little neighbourhood restaurant fit for a very casual meal out. I found my overall experience mediocre."}
{"text":"A great food experience. I love the medeteranian style resto with the kitchen in the front.  Small yet intemate  True Italian menu. All fresh. The primi was superb.   We had the \"family menu\" gives a sampling of many of the dishes"}
{"text":"Great great find in the city. Some of the tastiest italian food in the city (pastas can not be rivaled by any other restaurant in the area) great food - good, but not superb staff, although their personalities make up for the potential tardiness on busy nights.   If you are doing a group dinner - great place for well sized options, and portions, to order sides, and share, (except mains)  you will be stuffed, and price point is the icing on the cake as they are moderate (and a steal compared to the quality of the food you are getting!)  prepare for a noisy, cramped dining area though. Less so as the night progresses"}
{"text":"Great tasting good made with high quality ingredients served up in small, but overpriced, portions in a dimly lit casual atmosphere by rushed, but friendly, waiters."}
{"text":"Ordered the Braised Lamb Shank cooked with peas and onions.  First off, I'm not a fan of peas in particular... But that day I decoded to try things for a change and also ordered the asparagus as a side.  (never tried asparagus in my entire life!)  As the order came, it all smelt simply delicious and the flavour unimaginable as compared to anything I've ever tasted.  I actually liked the asparagus!  Truly worth the visit.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place is different than any other Italian restaurant I've eaten at in the city. You walk in and the place is tiny, dimly lit with only candle light. It was packed when we were there on a Sunday night, but not uncomfortable at all.   The main chef is this nice Italian lady, who is very sweet and friendly.  Now as for the food, the menu changes daily, and is written on a giant chalk board at the back of the restaurant. This proves that the ingredients are very fresh (which is probably why the food is so tasty!) but be careful not to become to attached to certain dishes, as the next day they may be gone.  The pasta dishes were great, as well as the calamari and meatballs (which were a little salty, but still good.) The steak was absolutely incredible, very large, and was $15 if you could believe! I went with 6 people and we ordered a bunch of dishes for all of us to share, which worked out quite well.  I'm not too big on desserts anywhere, but we ordered everything off the dessert menu, and everything was great.   This is a traditional Italian restaurant, and the menu isn't huge, but as I said everything we ordered tasted great, and I really liked the atmosphere. Wold recommend to anyone who likes authentic Italian."}
{"text":"Great food! Great atmosphere!  Place was totally buzzin!  It's quite tight and busy so be sure to make a reso. We just shared a ton of plates (family style) and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Alright. So first of all, I have to admit that I am very cheap. I don't like paying more than $15 for a meal and if I do that, I want to be full at the end. $20 at tops, if I'm not doing buffet or all you can eat. This isn't my kind of restaurant, not because it has small tasting plates, but because these tasting plates are not in my desired price range.  Had:  Calamari ($8.50) - about 7-8 small pieces of calamari. A small mixed lettuce salad below. Calamari was tender, but quite salty. Also not fried as crispy as I would like it. Salad was more a garnish than anything. A palate cleanser if you will.  Caprese salad ($12.50) - I've never paid $12.50 for four slices of tomato and three average sized slices of cheese, two or three basil leaves and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar and olive oil before. I feel incredibly ripped off. Yes, it was buffalo mozzarella, but for that price, I'm still expecting more. I've had buffalo caprese before, for cheaper, and there was considerably more of it. Quite disappointing.  Burrata ($14) - for $14, this was the most decent appetizer we got, from a price/portion/quality ratio perspective. Good enough portion of burrata to share between the four of us. Probably about five cherry tomatoes halved (so ten cherry tomato halves). Two thick wedges of bread. It would have been nice to have more bread. The burrata was quite nice, but I expected the inside to be slightly more creamy. It was lovely and fresh tasting though. Super light. Went great with the olive oil and a touch of vinegar. Yum.  Veal Lasagna ($10.75) - This wasn't horrible for the price, but I expected it to be bigger. If this is the $10.75 portion, I'm quite curious as to what the $7.50(?) portion looks like, but not curious enough to come back to check. Taste-wise, it was quite good. Tomato sauce wasn't overwhelming. You could taste the veal, which was nice. The pasta was quite tasty. The parmesan cheese was served on the side, but I opted out of it. My dad, who did put the parmesan cheese on, said that the cheese + the lasagna was quite salty. Mine (sans cheese) was only slightly salty. I attribute it to the bite of the cheese inside the lasagna.  Pork chop ($15) - Alright in terms of portion, but by no means outstanding. Modest sized chop. Frenched. Served with a small portion of roasted onions and peppers. Shared among four people, it amounted to about a bite and a half per person.   Service was lovely, although there was a slip up of a mistaken order. We were served two things that weren't ours, and after we let them know, these two were removed from the table (I think I might have accidentally breathed on the server's arm as he put those two dishes on the table, or I may have breathed on those dishes themselves...sorry to whoever received them after). It was very nice of them to recommend Hotel Gelato for dessert after we told them we weren't interested in cake.   The ambiance was comfy, if a tad small. Our table had two candles, and with the olive oil and the vinegar bottles along with the candles, it left not much space for our plates, which we were sharing. I almost burned my arm a couple times.   Interesting thing to note. We had four people at the table. Two had steak knives and two had butter knives. Odd.  All in all, the food here is good, but the portions leave something to be desired. Would I come again? Sure...if I wasn't paying."}
{"text":"Rosie and family provide one of the best Italian dining experiences in Toronto. Don't miss the calamari, veal sausage and lamb shank. Terrific service, food and ambiance are why this restaurant remains one of the most popular in the Eglinton strip."}
{"text":"Specialty: Southern Italian Location:  516 Eglinton Avenue West, Toronto, Ontario Menu items: Caprese salad, Pepper with Arugula and Goat Cheese, Grilled Calamari, Shrimp Linguini, Fish of the Day and Sexy Duck Leg  What do all restaurants have in common on a Monday night? They are all closed! Except for 7 Numbers Restaurant, where Mama Rosa (aka Rosa Marinuzzi) uses the quiet, low-traffic day of the week (once a month) to teach foodies, cooks and food aficionados the Italian way of cooking. For $85 per person, Chef Rosa teaches you the way to Italian cooking with a hands-on lesson, a 3 course meal, all the wine you want and even a few lessons in Italian. Each class is unique and intimate with a limit of about twenty people per class thus giving everyone an opportunity to get their hands dirty.  With Rosa's effervescent personality and way of cooking, one is bound to have a great time while tasting, cooking and chopping alongside her. She is a force to be reckon with and her passion for cooking simple, yet delicious dishes shines through with her food. The ambiance is lively and the flowing glasses of wine definitely liven up any Monday night!  Starting with the salads, Chef Rosa is of the mind that simple and minimalistic is always better, and that generosity in the use of salt and olive oil is a must. From the Caprese salad, to the Grilled Calamari with fricassee, and the Pepper and Arugula Coat Cheese salad, Rosa teaches us how much fun one can have with a salad, and how much flavour one can get out of those leafy greens.  Rosa's pastas are four-dimensional in taste. They are addictive, comforting and extremely tasty. While making the Shrimp Linguini pasta I noticed that the chef uses her secret home-made sauce - Giardiniera - also called \"sotto aceti\", which means \"under vinegar\", a common term for pickled foods. The Italian version includes onions, celery, zucchini, carrots, cauliflower, olive oil, pimentos and hot peppers. The pickled vegetables are in white wine vinegar. Bringing all the flavours together in the pasta dish, from the meat, to the tomato and even the garlic. A must have when you visit the Mama.  In tune with the pasta, 7 Numbers also applies the traditional tomato sauce, with the Giardiniera of course, to the fish of the day. The night's dish consisted of arctic char that was tossed in a fine layer of seasoned flour and then cooked in less than 4 minutes in the infamous tomato sauce. The end result? A buttery fish that absorbed all the flavours, exploding with a punch in one's mouth. Who would've thought fish could even do that? Simply brilliant.  As the night went on and we got to spend more time with Rosa, we discovered that she has a sultry side. She believes that food should be sexy, and well, fun. So she created the Sexy Duck Leg, a tasty piece of leg (duck) cooked in white wine and baked golden with rosemary branches. A juicy fall-of-the-bone decadence.  A big thanks for the Mama herself and her staff for making Mondays the new Fridays with their smile, love for cooking and great food.  Buen Provecho, Viviana."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came here on a Sunday night and surprisingly it was decently busy. The restaurant don't take reservations for parties under 6 so we were lucky to get a table since the place isn't too big.  I have been to the Danforth location and the menu items looked the same. We decided to order 2 apps and an entree for each of us. The items we ordered:  Spicy grilled shrimp with this avocado salsa Gorgonzola, strawberry and walnut spinach salad Veal meatballs with a side of linguine  Orechiette pasta Linguine with a rich tomato sauce and rapini  All the dishes were delicious and satisfying. The portions are actually really good for sharing. The flavours of each dish were well thought out and super tasty. I would say its Italian comfort food if there are such terms :)  The service was awesome and the servers are very attentive and knowledgeable. It was a really enjoyable evening with great food and atmosphere!   I definitely recommend this Italian restaurant and will be back again in the near future."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!!! Best homemade Italian food in town. They never disappoint, no matter how many times I come back. Great, warm friendly service and so endearing to see Mama at the front cooking."}
{"text":"If you want great honest home style Italian food you will do no better than seven numbers.   The lasagna as noted by others is the best in the city.   Everything Rosa does is done with love and the key to success is the simplicity.    Calamari is light crisp and the best you will eat, the sexy duck is like a happy duck who just can't wait to be eaten.     We eat here quite frequently and it is always a fan favourite when we bring in guests from out of town.    Let Momma Rosa and the fantastic staff at seven numbers take care of you for a night you won't forget."}
{"text":"This small, sexy Italian bistro is simply FABULOUS. Mama Rosa mans the kitchen nightly, and her staple creations are pretty much all winners. You can't go wrong.  Choose from small dishes handwritten on the chalkboards, many of which you can always get and other selections rotate. My favourites: to start, shrimp with spicy mashed pee puree, grilled sardines with tomato salsa (THE BEST sardines ever), burrata cheese (silky mozarella-style cheese that's big enough to share). Pasta/lasagnas are authentic Italian and awesome. Personally, I like to get a side of rapini but they also have other veg selections. For mains, the \"sexy duck leg\" is drool-worthy, so good; the osso bucco is sensational, probably the best version of this dish that I've ever had; and the meatballs are dynamite.  Wine list/cocktails (use the ipad to make your selection) and desserts...all are always excellent.  I'm a regular here, and the food is consistent! Mama Rosa even travels back to Italy every once in awhile and comes home to Toronto with a new signature recipe.  Great atmosphere, though it can get a bit loud, but who cares--they play great music. And what really takes this place to the next level is the SERVICE....amazing!!! If you get Jordan, Tzedenko (not sure of the spelling), or the guy with glasses as your waiter (I forget his name but he's also a doll) they treat you like family. 5 stars baby!"}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect coming here, but gotta say I left very full and very happy.   We ordered to share: - Calamari (delicious! loved it) - Grilled shrimp with spicy pea purée (meh, would pass on this next time) - Burrata (delicious as well and good to share)  For my main, I ordered the fish of the day, which was a well-cooked, simple yet very tasty sea bass. My fellow diners ordered the meatballs (heavenly! really they are great and taste like meatballs I've never had before), the veal lasagna (he said it was great) and lamb chops (also good feedback).  We ordered the flourless chocolate cake for dessert which was nice.  Overall, very simple preparations but clearly the way it's cooked really makes each dish shine. Would come back again for sure!   Also major points for the service - our waiter was very friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Homemade italian fare oozing with passion and love.    If its in the revolving menu that evening, do get the veal sausage.  Its wonderful, juicy, and very tasty.    Make sure to try the veal meatballs, the eggplant parmigiana, and the almighty Lasagna!  Basically, you cannot go wrong.  And ask for the hot peppers on the side.  I wish they sold these!!!  Ambiance is casual/romantic.  Very good food without the pretension.   10000 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Happy Birthday to my Hakka Wife!  This restaurant was another recommendation from my co-worker Eli.  It was Saturday night and I was planning to take my wife here for her birthday.  We decided to ixnay on the reservations and just go and wait.  We park on the street and walk to the restaurant.  There was only one couple in front of us which was great.  The host said that it would be a 20 minute wait, and it was that long.  All the tables were filled and man, it's so loud in there.  When you walk inside, the famous Italian mom Rose was cooking in her tight little kitchen.  She had about 6 helpers/servers to dish out her cooking and clean.  The place itself is kinda tiny, I think max 50 seats available.  The menu is always changing so this time, it was Veal Lasagna, Linguine with Rapini and Orecchiette with Ricotta.  $10.75 a bowl?  You can't go wrong!  A table for 2 opens up and we are seated.  We are told everything is tomato based pasta which was fine.  I saw a whole ton of peeps buying the veal meatballs and it looked delicious.  We decide to order veal lasagna, veal meatballs and orecchiette pasta.  The waiter gives the bread and within 5 to 6 minutes, I kid you not, our food came out, hot and fresh.  The food was steamy but we couldn't wait, we fork it out our mouths quickly.  Veal Lasagna was good!  It was not intact in a square like in other restaurants.  It is more of the shredded kind.  It didn't blow me away but it's homely, tomato-y, and rich as hell.  You totally need to eat it with the complimentary bread to dilute the sauce and oiliness.  2 Veal Meatballs came loaded with tomato sauce and was absolutely tender.  We pushed a fork in it and it crumbled.  Delicious and soft no doubt.  The cheese in the veal lasagna and the veal meatballs have this distinct flavour.  I was not really a fan of it because it was strong.  It kinda reminded me of lamb, which was weird.  I trucked through it and was really satisfied.  The best part was that my Hakka Wife enjoyed eating her pasta.  What was kinda annoying was that it was so loud in the restaurant.  I found myself shouting at my wife and asking her to repeat what she said.  After a few people left, the sound level got better.  This comfort food just sticks to the bones and although rich and oily, gives a taste you will remember, just in case you come back for more.  It's great knowing that it comes from a real Italian mother and a very affordable price.  Stays true to the authenticity of the cooking.  I plan to return in the distant future."}
{"text":"My Family from Winnipeg asked for Italian and something different - with a vibe and energy that they don\t get at home.  Well we were perplexed and put out some feelers and found 7numbers.    This will be my new go-to restaurant as long as i have a reservation as the lineups scared me.  Knowing that \"mama\" changes the menu daily is very exciting!!  There were 7 of us and we nervously ordered the family meal.  The calamari was so fresh and beautifully done.....it said fried but there was only a light dusting of breading and just perfectly done.  the 3 salads were all great.  the 3 pastas that night were lovely, simple sauce-- tomato based - perfect. The Veal Lasagna stood out from the pack we asked for a second plate.    We were not rushed through our meal we had time between courses to drink and talk.  Although it was very loud in the restaurant it felt right and we could still all hear each other and enjoy the atmosphere.  The mains - thank god we had room because they were no complaints.  My lamb shank fell off the bone and tasted fantastic.  I could go on.....but i think I want to go for dinner now........"}
{"text":"I'm not big on writing reviews but nothing motivates me more to do so then getting a bad case of diarrhea after a highly anticipated first visit. My girlfriend and I came home feeling sick, but I am clearly suffering more so because I ate the majority of it. We shared the sardines appetizer, seafood linguine, and veal chop. The sardines were overcooked and dry but the sauce was ok. The seafood linguine sauce tasted great but a little more linguine would have been great. I think the lobster was the culprit. Something about the aftertaste was a little off. A kind of smelly aquarium. The veal chop was just a veal chop, for something that cost 28 bucks, throw in a vegetable or garnish. I thought the taste was interestingly okay,  but my GF thought it was way too salty and couldn't eat more than two bites.  I like to be supportive of local businesses and restaurants since I own property and business here myself but shit, not when you get people sick. I'm so sick, 6 times and three hours later to be exact. I'm having trouble writing this review. Chef, please get your act together. I'm sure you don't want the health inspector  breathing down your neck."}
{"text":"Family style authentic Italian restaurant. I really enjoy 7 numbers having been here a few times now. I personally think it's a great menu for sharing so come with a small group.   Service and atmosphere were all good. The restaurant is pretty small and has a bit of a rustic type of feeling to it.  Veal meatballs - 5/5 this is my favourite thing on the menu. Super tasty, eat this with the special hot pepper sauce they have. I think it's perfect.  Lamb shank - 3.5/5 a little bland at my most recent visit but still a good dish  Calamari - 4/5 pretty small portion but fresh  Pasta 4/5 I don't recall which of the 3 choices they have we got but you got could taste the fresh ingredients being used"}
{"text":"I honestly love this restaurant and Mama Rosa, the cook. She is really the star of the show. Her food is delicious, home-style Italian cooking. And the prices are very reasonable, which is something you cannot find too often in Toronto. The place is always packed and for good reason."}
{"text":"Went here last night out of chance. The ambience is ideal for those looking to have a fun yet intimate experience. Although it was a little loud, the candle lit environment was warming and a great place to take someone on a date. We tried the calamari which I found was a little on the soggy end. However my friend enjoyed it and she finished it quickly. The lamb shank and duck leg were both good. For those looking to try the duck leg, I'd recommend finishing it quickly, for some reason letting it serenade causes it to become salty. Taste wise the food was top notch and relatively inexpensive, nothing over $25."}
{"text":"I stopped here one evening with a few friends and was glad to be greeted with amicable and friendly service.  The restaurant itself is tiny, so don't bring a huge group.  As a herbivore, my choices were not entirely limited and the staff was willing to make accomodations.  The boccaccini was delicious and the fried artichokes were good enough for seconds (which were promptly devoured).  The only problem I had was that not all of the dishes came out piping hot.   Hopefully, once I have a job I can afford to taste the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I loved the Vibe of this restaurant. The Chalk Board Menu and service - amazing. The Wine, not great. The food was delicious - it really was - I'm not the biggest fan of Italian restaurants only because meat and cheese and pasta together, tend to work :) I did get fish at this visit. Like I said, VIBE - excellent. I would recommend."}
{"text":"Okay. After dinning in and then ordering carry out I quickly realize that this place is all about the experience. Grab 6-7 of your closets loved ones, friends, or family. Order a couple bottles of wine and just relax. Enjoy the food slowly and the time with everyone. Get the check, smile, and order a couple more rounds of drinks for everyone because this place is decently priced.   I never really understood the importance of ambiance correlating with the taste of the food. I loved eating in here. The service was fantastic, the cooks were  checking in on us periodically. Being from Detroit, I'm always happy to hear they have Motown jamming in the background too. It's got a great laid back family vibe.   The food was good, but the meatballs were everyones' favorite choice by far.  Ingredients tasted fresh which makes sense since their menu changes often. That night though we couldn't stop talking about this place.  I decided recently to get the same food to go. BIG mistake. Do not order to go here. You will be disappointed. You have to eat the food fresh, especially the meatballs. The food becomes a bit greasy as it sits and chills.   Go there, relax, and sedate yourself in the experience with your loved ones."}
{"text":"This is a cute little Italian restaurant in North York. But unlike most Italian restaurants in North York this place does not have pizza, they have couple pastas and some mains.  It is a short menu with not too many choices, but enough for you to think about what you want before you order.  We caught the lasagna, key lime pie, and the lamb shank. Our server highly recommended the lasagna and it did not disappoint us. The lamb shank was extremely tender and very tasty, okay with very simple ingredients- peas and lamb. The key lime pie was also very delicious."}
{"text":"I went to the Danforth location last night. I was told that this restaurant had the best lasagne in the city. For some reason, they like to serve luke-warm water to their guests. I asked the server twice for ice, but she did not bring it. The restaurant only had one other table for two in it. The restaurant was not busy at all. The caprese salad was good. I liked the mozzarella and the basil was very fresh. The olive oil and bread was...okay. I expected better quality. The lasagne came, and I was really excited. Unfortunately, the lasagne was very greasy, and I could not finish it. The meat and noodles were under seasoned.   I don't know if I would come back to this restaurant because there are soooo many restaurants in the city. I felt that I had purchased better frozen lasagnes in the past. I don't consider myself a great cook. However, I know that I can make better lasagne myself.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was warm and campy with candles in old wine bottles, and the wine served in table glasses.   The staff is all visible because the kitchen is at the front, so all their antics are on display. I actually had tip money thrown at me inadvertently, which was all part of the fun.   The french cut pork chop was awesome, topped with caramelized onions. Grilled rapini was excellent, as was the shrimp with spicy pea puree.   As a gluten intolerant person, my options were limited. I prefer their other restaurant, 5 Doors North."}
{"text":"Very solid homemade Italian food. Limited menu. Restaurant is pretty cramped. Service sucked."}
{"text":"I can't believe there are such high ratings for 7 numbers. I had high expectations for this place before coming due to the reviews. But it was about a 2.5 imho.  Shared the following with hubby...  Arugula salad with red pepper and goat cheese $12 - This was the best dish of the evening (sad isn't it? It was just a salad). I liked it as the goat cheese was part of the dressing. The red pepper was delish but wish the portion was bigger. A tad small for $12  Veal Lasagne - Lasagne with fresh-made pasta sheets, fresh ground veal, mozzarella, and housemade sauce $12.75 (large) - Our friends ordered a small variation of this and honestly perhaps we should have ordered the small as well. It looked around the same size except it was on a slightly larger plate. There was too much pasta and sauce and too little meat. My friend called her small bowl a snack size pasta. Very saucy. That \"homemade\" sauce seems to make a repeat with a lot of dishes... But it wasn't that impressive. Tasted like something from a can.   Meatballs - Big meatballs stuffed with mozzarella, smothered in sauce $13 - I didn't like this at all and let my hubby eat most of it. There was only a small pinky tip size mozzarella bit in it. Wasn't even served hot. Way too much sauce. I ended up dipping bread with it.  As for service, the server who served us was very polite but the general manager Tom? (glasses with plaid shirt) was super rude. Three people could not attend last minute and he said something like if I had known, I would have removed this table long ago (they attached another small table to one end). I think he could have handled the situation a lot better. Thanks for denting the mood of a friend's birthday. We noticed Tom kept giving our table dirty looks as well. At least the food came pretty quickly and our server always made sure things were ok.   Not coming back again. No one was full and we got wings afterwards."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for many years and i have to say, the place is always a hit for me. It's just one of those restaurants i know i can rely on for a good meal and a nice night out. The menu is great - the food is heart felt - the service is personal - rossa is always there. On the first monday of every month, she even does a cooking class.   Compared to the danforth location that her sons run, this location is less 'party' and more family."}
{"text":"I went here on Saturday's night so it was pretty pack with group of family and friends. However you only have to wait for 15-20 mins. The food is excellent comparing to its price which is very reasonable. I love the atmosphere the most! Warm and family little cozy place :-) I will definitely going back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Great Italian home cooking.  This place is very packed, and you can only book if you have a party of 6! So we turned up at 6:30 pm!  There was still no table available that is really worth it.  We were seated in a very tiny table, but then what can we say! If it is popular, may be it is worth a try.  The menu changes constantly, it will be up at 5 pm every day.  Apart from the menu, there is a 'Family Menu' of $29, which has a bit of everything, it is a bit like a tasting menu!   The price is very good here.  So as the wine, but of course it is not fine dinning.  I had sardines, duck leg and salad.  The sardine is fresh and with two sauce, one is spicy and one is tomatoes. The 'Sexy Duck Leg' is slightly salty for my taste but it is very tasty. The salad's dressing is just right amount of the vinegar.  My companion had  SPINACHI (Baby spinach salad with Gorgonzola, Strawberries, Walnuts and a Balsamic reduction), a ORECHIETTE as Primi, and the Lamb Shank, it was tasty.  We had the house wine, and it was ok too.  The whole meal comes to under $70, which was very good in Toronto.  I would go back again.  We decided not to have dessert, because it was not made in-house like other food.  Was this Review ??"}
{"text":"Straight up: get the family style dinner! Bang for your buck and a tasting of almost everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Upon arrival, I was immediately charmed by the ambiance of rustic decor and candlelit tables. The kitchen is out by the front as you walk in and you can see the bubbling pasta sauce ready to be tossed in a bowl of fresh cavatelli pasta. This isn't a typical pasta/pizzeria joint (not to knock pasta/pizzeria joints). The menu changes periodically and everything is made fresh and geared towards sharing (family-style), just like what you would have in a typical home in Italy.We met some of my coworkers there, 8 of us at our table. Our waiter was helpful in explaining the theme of the restaurant and made some fine wine recommendations.   My wife and I decided to share one of each of the antipasti, primi, secondi and contorni. There was enough food to satisfy both of us and needless to say they all were absolutely delicious. The grilled shrimp with spicy pea puree - how do they get so much flavour in the shrimp?? And pea puree with shrimp? I know, but it works! We had a cavatelli pasta bowl with cheese grated over top (forgot the type of cheese). Simple yet magnificent. My wife had dreams about it that night. We also got a side of grilled asparagus (yum) and the osso bucco as the main, where the meat was cut up and bathed in a luscious, sort of stew-like tomato based sauce. We finished it off with an apple crumble, which was just ok and the only thing we ate that was less of exceptional. It would have been better warmed up.  And the surprise ending was that the owner, Rosa, came by our table and was so welcoming and friendly that we had to take pictures with her. So our entire table pretty much had individual pictures taken with her.  In summary, if you want a great dinner and evening out with friends or with that special person in your life, or even just alone, go to 7 Numbers, Eglinton and you will be blown away!"}
{"text":"One of my oldest memories is standing in line at the massively popular 7 Numbers original location waiting for a table. It was pure chaos, people waiting in line for hours to sit at a small wooden table just to eat cooking that reminds you of home. The chaos of the line was nothing in comparison to that of the kitchen, cooks moving each and every direction just to meet the needs of the hungry customers. However, one woman stood out through all the hustle and bustle of the kitchen, mama. Her tenacity and enthusiasm for the delicious food she created at her establishment was unmatched. She would greet our family outside and give us all hugs and kisses as if we were actually family. I am a big proponent of looking purely at the food when visiting a gastronomic establishment, however at 7 Numbers it was different. The atmosphere was not that of The French Laundry or Joel Rubochon in Paris, but it truly felt like home. Somewhere you are not afraid to have an extra glass of wine, eat your entire basket of bread or order more than one pasta. I will admit that I do have a bias because I have always and will always go to this restaurant as long as I am living in Toronto. Going back recently was an amazing experience because I no longer have to wait in line for hours to eat her delicious food. You sit down at small wooden table, accompanied by an unpretentious menu at a very fair price. My favorites on the menu happen to be the lamb shank which is fall off the bone tender as well as the orecchiette and linguine which have a pasta sauce that is unrivaled by any. Mama will not be an individual who will in a James Beard award, but instead she focuses on food that seems almost philanthropic in a way. Mama simply wants to put amazing food on a plate, in an unpretentious environment, at a fair price. What else could you really ask for from a chef? Mama, I would like to tip my hat to you for building an institution in the neighborhood and always staying true to your Italian roots, I will see you soon."}
{"text":"Best. Resto. Ever. Its our go to restaurant on the danforth Food is great, vibe is great, Vito & staff are amazing! Eat here!!!"}
{"text":"My neighbour's Nonna used to spoil us for lunches.  Freshly sauteed rapini with thinly sliced garlic, hearty thick hunter's ragu on top of freshly made linguine... these were my lunches for nearly 3 years and though they were home style and simple, they were decadent and made with love.  As I grew up, I often missed those type of simple Italian meals but lovingly prepared.  Great thing is that I don't have to miss those meals anymore... I can find them here at 7 Numbers!  The spot is a small cozy but loud and warm Osteria type of eating establishment.  Meals are simple but very well executed.  The owners are part of wonderful warm Italian family and you really feel the love when you walk in.  Warm big smiles and loud voices are everywhere.  It's a fun and joyful atmosphere.  I had the antipasti of grilled shrimp to start.  Wow, it was great.  They were perfectly seared and still tender.  No rubbery or mushiness here.  The flavour was wonderful because it was well seasoned and it came with a spicy roasted red pepper sauce.  For my main, I had the duck leg and it was so succulent.  It was nicely seasoned with rosemary and they had the right balance so it didn't overpower the duck flavour.  I also had grilled rapini and zucchini.  This sent me back to my childhood days of my neighbour's Nonna cooking.  Oh it was wonderful.... nicely cooked so it still had some crunch but they took the bitterness out with some citrus (I think).  The prices are so affordable... nothing over $20 and that included the mains!  Overall, it was a great meal.  The service was fast and effortless.  It was clear from looking at the servers that they had some repeat customers.  Those individuals had a lot more personable attention but I didn't feel left out being a first time customer.  Lots of love to go around.  It can get packed quite quickly so try to arrive before 7 pm when it's packed full of people."}
{"text":"Great homemade pasta, so chewy! Price is really good, decent portion and love the decor/atmosphere. The menu changes every few days. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"They offer a $25 pre-show dinner deal (for Danforth Music Hall) on their prix fixe dinner which is regularly $29. We had the arugula and goat cheese salad, giant calamari, insalata caprese,  giant veal meatballs, the raciola infornata (slices of veal rolled with baby spinach, hot peppers and Romano cheese) and two pasta dishes. The food was plenty for two. The atmosphere was classy but down-to-earth at the same time. The staff make you feel like you're at a fancy restaurant. The calamari and meatballs were the standout dishes for me."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends for summerlicious. The inside of the restaurant is a lot nicer than the outside so fret not if you think the exterior is chintzy. The start of the dinner was good with my veal meatball appetizer, which was easily the best dish of the night. It was juicy, perfectly flavoured and just delicious. Unfortunately the rest of the meal made me wonder if I just don't get Italian. The next dish was the veal lasagna, which was also good but very salty. I was downing that water to settle my taste buds. Next up the fried cauliflower, which sounded great on paper, was very bland. I had to pour the parmesan cheese on it to add some flavour. Lastly for dessert I picked the lemon tart, which had a veeeery lemony filling and a stragenly hard crust. Honestly, if it werne't for the veal meatball I'd rate this place a 2/5 but it's kind of unfair I guess because summerlicious isn't always representative of a restaurant's true quality."}
{"text":"Came here a few times in the past year and am finally getting the chance to review it.   The restaurant, to me, is perfect. The ambiance and food go hand in hand. Food is delicious, I always get the lasagna and it always blows my mind. The appetizers are all delicious and I always have a hard time deciding what main to get because they all sound amazing.   Location is great, right in eglinton with street parking and cheap green p paid parking all available. Rosa in the front is always welcoming.   Will keep on returning so long as the food is this good."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for dinner with a group of friends.   The food was delicious and the atmosphere was very nice too.  The reason I gave them only 3 stars is because first, my friend was being rushed by a waiter to give him back the iPad menu before she had the chance to decide because he needed to take it to another table. Off to a bad start. I was also disappointed that a proper Italian restaurant does not offer beef or salmon carpaccio - usually a staple in a good Italian restaurant.  Then we asked for tiramisu and the waitress said that this location does not have it but their other location on Danforth does. We all looked at one another not quite sure what to do with this information??? The food we did get was fresh and delicious.   One of the best osso bucos I've had (And I've had many all over the world including in Italy) Overall not bad but definitely room for improvement... Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I had a very, very lovely evening here last night - the memory of the flavours makes my eyes roll back in my head!  I was brought here as a surprise for our second anniversary because Sweetheart knows I'm a huge Italian food fan, and he wanted to bring me to an authentic place.  At most Italian restaurants, I just order pasta, because the meat doesn't really interest me that much, I love my carbs, and especially because usually the pasta is more than enough to fill me up - especially if I want any appetizers or desserts.  But here at 7 Numbers, they do it the right way - the portions are smaller because they're designed to be eaten through, and the prices reflect that (very reasonable prices!).  So you're supposed to have an antipasti (appetizer), a primi (pasta course), and secondi (meat course) with contorni (side vegetables, usually in the form of veggies).    I was eyeing the fixed price menu but I had a picky eater with me, so we decided to pick everything out ourselves.  We got the calamari, a large lasagna portion, the rapini linguini, the sexy duck leg, the grilled pork chop, and we got a slice of the flourless chocolate cake to go.  The calamari was delicious!!!  It was very generously seasoned, cooked just right, and came on a bed of assorted lettuce.  We squeezed the lemon slice it came with over it but I kind of wish we didn't because the coating on the calamari was the kind that wilts as soon as it hits liquid.  But it was very, very good and the lemon went very well with it.  The pastas were really something to write home about!  They were quite salty to me, which means Sweetheart found them perfect, and they were cooked a little longer than I liked, but the flavours were just wonderful.  The rapini linguini was beautifully garlicky and olive oily, and the tomatoes in it were magically not acidic.  The bitterness of the rapini cut through the richness very well.  The lasagna was very, very hearty and rich.  At first bite I kind of thought the sauce was too acidic but once you have it with the meat sauce and the cheese inside, it's perfect.  The tartness of the sauce goes perfectly with the meat sauce, which must have been cooked for hours!  I need to re-emphasize how rich and almost heavy the pastas are - the portions are smaller, which is perfect, but if anyone's squeamish about seeing a puddle of oil at the bottom of their plate, this pasta is not for them!    The meats were good but not as impressive as the pastas.  The sexy duck leg was encrusted with rosemary, which made it taste very herbal, but it was very good.  Kind of small though, and quite salty - but good.  The grilled pork chop was delightfully thick and succulent - as juicy as a grilled pork chop could be!  But the braised onion/pepper garnish it came with DELICIOUS.  It was super savoury, kind of like they were lifted out of a super flavourful stew, and they melted in my mouth.  Delicious.  The grilled asparagus was just right - they tasted like high quality oily oil, they were crunchy, they had the delicious grilled flavour - very nice and basic.  We saved the flourless chocolate cake for home because we didn't want to skip it but were too full to have it right away.  It was dense and chocolatey and sweet without being too sweet.  Very good.  Our server was also quite pleasant and patient with us despite our questions and indecisiveness!  I'd love to come back again and I hope to join the cooking class one day! :)"}
